8248994,5,B00133MKQ0,"If you are of a certain age, and waited with baited breath for every weekly episode to find out what the outcome between the ""heros"" and ""villains"" was, then this is the DVD you must own!  At the time these episodes were originally made, we all thought they were the best of the best.  (Remember the ""flash gordon ring"", etc)?  However, now that we are older, we can see how cheesy and cornball these episodes are!  They are fun, laughable, and really lousy ""special"" effects!  And the costumes!!! These are so totally worth the price, and does ""transport"" us back into a age where things were more innocent, and one could enjoy a ""family fun night"" together without breaking the bank!  Makes one long for those times again.",1387411200,3,724,4.6171875
8248995,3,B00133MKQ0,"A sampling of the motion picture serials we (of a certain age) used to go to the movies every weekend to find out ""what happened"". Cheesy acting, lousy special effects, but great fun. Nice selection of chapter plays.",1383868800,,216,4.7105263157894735
8248996,5,B00133MKQ0,I couldn't believe that I'd remember these weekly Saturday Adventures.  Lot's of fun....you won't be disappointed. Just fast forward the opening episode review of the week before and it rolls right along.,1270512000,7,204,5.375
8248997,5,B00133MKQ0,"A treasure trove for those looking for action, vintage futuristic rocket ships, laboratories, outlandish space suits and costumes.  Great fun!
The perfect companion to Sci-fi classics 100 movie pack, Superman or Flash Gordon sets.
Each serial is complete and made of 12 20 minute episodes. And each dvd has a bonus complete episode from a sci-fi fifties tv show.",1215388800,10,362,5.135593220338983
8248998,4,B00133MKQ0,"This collection of Sci-Fi serials is exactly what I expected. The whole family gets together to watch a new episode of oh so serious cornball. In the Phantom Empire, the characters literally hand out pails to their new recruits. We call the story, ""Attack of the bucket people!"" It is good clean fun. The special effects are laughable. We enjoy Gene Autry, the singing coyboy.",1214438400,7,376,4.8
