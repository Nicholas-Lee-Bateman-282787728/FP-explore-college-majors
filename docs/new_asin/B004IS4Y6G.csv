8431131,5,B004IS4Y6G,"This is a great video with lots of instruction but the actual movements itself are pretty advanced ~ they incorporate hands/arms/legs all together and all are flowing in opposite directions. (If that makes sense) I'm new to qi gong so I had a little bit of a hard time with my coordination but once you get the feel for it you can really feel the energy in your bah-dey. Have fun with it, it's worth a consistent attempt.",1344470400,4,421,4.410256410256411
