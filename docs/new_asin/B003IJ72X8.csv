8397417,5,B003IJ72X8,Huge Phil fan and I love these Masters created DVD's. My father and I own both 2004 and 2006. 2010 is the year Phil hit the shot from behind the tree on 13. Same year he nearly went eagle-eagle-eagle (lipped wedge on 15). If you are a fan of Phil or of the Masters you should get this one or other Masters DVD's. Long enough to give bits of all 4 rounds but concise enough to not drag for non golf enthusiasts. These are some of the best Major DVD's I own.,1391558400,,456,3.967391304347826
8397418,4,B003IJ72X8,I watched parts of the Masters Tournament earlier this year and wanted to get this item since I'm a Lefty fan. It provides a nice look at the events overall and keeps things moving along nicely. It's certainly not a substitute for watching the live presentation since everything has to be so compressed to fit on this one highlights disc.,1291680000,,338,4.65
