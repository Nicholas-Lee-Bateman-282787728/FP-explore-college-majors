7910596,5,B00000ICUB,"At least, Moe, Larry and Shemp probably had aspirations to become tv stars. Who knows if the trio had any idea that television would become the thing that would eventually doom their short film career at Columbia.

And it was Columbia who apparently put a stop to this potential new tv series by the stooges with legal action--their so called logic being that a tv show would interfere with their short films.

At any rate, Moe, Larry and Shemp put together a great pilot episode as the trio try their hands at being inferior decorators and assisting them were longtime stooge foils, the great Emil Sitka and the equally talented Symona Boniface.

Some familiar stooge gags such as ""trying to paint a table"" as seen in stooge shorts like ""Tassels in the Air"" get rehashed here and there's also a great scene with a door to door salesman who tries to peddle a pressure cooker to the stooges and Moe remarks after the scene ""we seem to attract the oddest people.""

If you're a fan of Moe, Larry and Shemp, then ""Jerks of All Trades"" will be sure to please.

7910597,4,B00000ICUB,"JERKS OF ALL TRADES (1949) is a very interesting short movie. It's the same lenght as a regular Three Stooges short. This is actually the pilot episode for a Three Stooges television show that never started. This might've been a great TV show. The plot of this short is like TASSELS IN THE AIR and A SNITCH IN TIME combined. However, the quality comes out blury and is not exactly watchable. Still, you must see this to be a true Stooge fan.",1012953600,4,441,4.390243902439025
7910598,5,B00000ICUB,"I loved this! It is strange seeing the Stooges in this format, especially with the live audience. Too bad the series never started. It would've been a great start, having the Stooges being interior decorators. They totally ruin that house! The Texas routine is the best, especially with Emil Sitka repeating it for his 'wife' (""They aren't from *clap clap clap clap* Texas, are they?"") The quality of film was bad but, as another reviewer here has mentioned, it was filmed with kinetiscope. Surreal but a must see!",1005264000,4,514,4.8522727272727275
7910599,5,B00000ICUB,Yet another classic stooge episode with Shemp. Words cannot describe how funny this is. It's a dirty shame Shemp had to die so sudden.,994550400,2,134,4.625
7910600,5,B00000ICUB,"A very rare item. This is the half-hour TV pilot for a TV series the Three Stooges were going to start, that unfortunately never took off. Too bad, because this is a gem. It features Moe, Larry, and Shemp as painters and paperhangers ordered to redecorate the house of a man who the Stooges get in trouble with early in the show. Features many classic gags, and even some new ones that we never see in Stooge shorts (the *clap, clap, clap, clap* Texas gag is a routine the boys loved using everywhere else EXCEPT for their shorts). This even has familiar Stooge short supporting actors, Emil Sitka and Symona Boniface. This was filmed in front of a live studio audience, and it feels rare (and good) to hear laughter in the background while the boys are doing their manic business. And it was also filmed in Kinescope, meaning they had to go on with the script, even if something went wrong, and there's some hilarious mistakes here, too (watch for Larry to miss his cue and have trouble putting up some curtains). This is a must-have for all Stooge fans. You will not be disappointed.",994377600,7,1085,4.540816326530612
