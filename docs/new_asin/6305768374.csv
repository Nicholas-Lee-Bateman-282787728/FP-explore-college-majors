1066566,5,6305768374,"From the opening shot, you know this film is not just another movie from the 60's.
Many films from this era showcase the ""angry young man"" character rebelling against some unfocused facet of society that they feel oppresses them. ""The Girl Getters"", also starring Oliver Reed, and ""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning"" are two such samplings from Britain that are quite memorable (also of note is the even rarer portrayal of the ""angry young woman"" in ""The Girl With Green Eyes"").
Oliver Reed is marvelous as the angry young man in this slice of life film set in Swinging London. Reed's disillusioned character has reached a point where the swinging lifestyle has become empty and unsatisfying, and he wonders if there is something more to life than just having fun.
Of course, Welles is on hand, and although his part is relatively small, it it pivotal nonetheless. As Lute, the millionaire advertising executive, Welles exudes the frightening presence of a man who is not to be denied anything he wants. Lute is pragmatic, cynical, and amused at Reed's faniciful idea of working for a cause instead of working for cash.
Even though Reed owns the film, one standout in the cast to be mentioned is the milquetoast character who asks Reed to join his failing literary magazine. Burdened by a harping wife who is unhappy with the poor life of a scholar and wants ""things"" likes sportscars and washing mashines.
Of course, Carol White is the foxy and quintessential London swinger, and would easily give Felicity Shagwell a run for her money.
These type of films are all too rare. Although there are a few American films that touch on the same issues with the same styling (""The Sweet Smell of Success"" and ""Love With the Proper Stanger"" both spring to mind), the British just had a knack for making solid ""class struggle"" films. They also had the actors that would make the films work and the characters believable. Reed and his fellow cast members excel in this one, and Welles is wonderful.

7893976,5,6305768374,"From the memorable opening montage of Oliver Reed casually but intensely walking and, impeccably dressed in his Savile Row best, and with an axe over his shoulder---you knew you were in for a treat! Michael Winner's ""I'll Never Forget What's 'Isname"" from 1967, was set in trend-setting and swinging London. Here, we have an unforgettable examination of the Counter Culture versus The Establishment---done the English way. This landmark film is a glimpse back to an era that can never be recaptured or recreated. Which had its own set of values that were simultaneously: conventional and anti-establishment. Oliver Reed 'Andrew Quint' is an ad-executive that has grown sick and tired of his banal and empty existence. He has lots of money, plenty of easy-women, chums and peers that emulate and respect him. But he wants something more out of life; something that is perhaps intangible and out of reach. His self-loathing is a reaction to his apathetic willingness to conform to a world he not so-secretly despises, and with good reason.

The film is a visual delight: stylish, sumptuously photographed, and it even has some very surreal imagery, all-in-one. Orson Welles plays 'Andrew's' boss---'Jonathan Lute' (in typical Orson Welles fashion), a representative of the 'powers-that-be'. And in many ways, he symbolizes 'Andrew's' alter-ego (doppelganger). Oliver Reed was simply excellent and so was the rest of the cast: Carol White, Norman Rodway, Harry Andrews, Wendy Craig, Marianne Faithful, Frank Finlay, Edward Fox, Mark Burns, etc., etc. The skillful and witty screenplay was written by Peter Draper, which was a wry satirical take on the social conditions of the day. And intelligently updates the 'angry young man' of the British 'kitchen-sink-dramas' of the early 60's. The cinematography by Otto Heller was top-notch (this art-form is all but forgotten). And of course, as always: Francis lai's beautiful musical score. I have not seen this film for what seemed an eternity and I am so glad that I finally get to own one. Expensive (it's out of print), but well worth it!

The DVD picture and sound quality by Anchor Bay is excellent (the film was completely restored). NTSC, English (no subtitles), extras (including: commentary by Michael Winner), aspect ratio: 1.85:1, NR 99 mins. (BTW: Michael Winner (1935 - 2013) passed away earlier this year. And it should be noted and not overlooked that, he gave us some very fine films indeed---i.e. ""The System"" 1964, ""The Jokers"" 1967, ""Hannibal Brooks"" 1969, ""The Games"" 1970, ""The Nightcomers"" 1971, ""The Mechanic"" 1972, ""Scorpio"" 1973, ""Death Wish"" 1974, etc.)

Love and Peace,

7893977,3,6305768374,"Didn't quite get the point of this one. I usually like Oliver Reed, but found this one useless, pointless, and somewhat empty.  Not up to Reed's usual quality.",1371081600,,159,4.678571428571429
7893978,4,6305768374,"I saw this film on Sky Movies in 2008, thought it was astonishing and upon seeing it again still love it. Yes, it is very dated but that element works. Why not step back in time to super sexy ad man Oliver Reed's era where erotic delights are thwarted by the realities of emotion, commerce and ego? Many great montage sequences of post war 60's Britain including some postcard shots of Cambridge complete with Emily Choir style ""oooo woooo"" singers and an astonishing ""ad"" that Ollie's ego maniacal character Quint creates to give the middle finger to the advertising establishment at a swank London awards show. Carol White (rest in peace) is brilliant as the secretary who squanders her self worth on Quint. Along with Hannibal Brooks and The Jokers, this is the must se Winner/Reed production.",1317945600,,796,4.817518248175182
7893979,5,6305768374,"While this black comedy is a wonderful window into Swinging London, one that lives & breathes & crackles with the energy of that time, the issues at hand are just as relevant today. If anything, the corruption, waste, and hypocrisy depicted in Andrew Quint's half-hearted struggle to break free of a comfortable but unsatisfying life are even stronger now. In the 1960s, it was still possible to escape the rat race for a time -- if you really wanted to, that is. And that's Quint's real dilemma: does he want to escape badly enough?

As previous reviewers have noted, Oliver Reed brings real presence & swaggering menace to the film. Yet for all of Quint's ferocity, he can't quite cut the cord entirely. The seductions of power & wealth are both subtle & blatant, sneaking into his soul even as he strives to overcome them. Orson Welles is perfectly cast as the smooth, affably cynical tempter ... but isn't he simply offering what everyone wants anyway? Easy to blame others, blame the Establishment! But in the end, the individual makes the decisive choice. Or not.

What gives the film real bite is its unwillingness to favor anyone. Quint may want to do honest creative work for a low-paying literary magazine, but its owner is only too eager to sell out & buy into the sweet & cozy life himself. Perhaps only Georgina, beautifully played by Carol White, approaches a degree of authenticity as a human being. With her lost, lonely eyes & sullen beauty, she seems an aching ghost already when we first meet her. And her fate is cruel & unsparing, taking Quint's last illusions of escape with her.

Of course, you can simply enjoy it as a glittering look at a specific time & place. It really does capture the giddy, kinetic atmosphere of the 1960s ... and who can't love that opening scene of a hip, nattily dressed, slyly smiling Olvier Reed walking into work with an axe slung casually over his shoulder & demolishing his desk? But there's a lot more going on here, and the surface is often peeled back to reveal the utter depravity of so many people -- for example, the alumni party that shockingly turns into a replay of ""The Most Dangerous Game.""

Director Michael Winner gives us an excellent commentary, offering juicy anecdotes & a thoughtful perspective on the times long after the fact. Like so many films from that period, it's drenched in color & filled with stylistic editing tics. But it's the story & its questions that will remain with you after the final credits roll. Highly recommended!",1274400000,2,2510,4.710706150341686

7893981,4,6305768374,"There are 60's movies and then there's ""I'll Never Forget What's 'is Name"". This is as crazy a 60's film can get. This is a movie in which Andrew (Oliver Reed) smashes up his desk just to quit his job, a boss from America that he hates (Orson Welles), two mistresses (which includes Marrianne Faithful-who says the first ever F-word near the end) that he picks up, a wife (Wendy Craig) that he doesn't trust, hangs with old college friends, breaks stuff, and then he meets Georgina (Carol White) for which he likes. And oh yes, there's the cou de gra (Spoiler report for those who haven't seen it): While riding with one of Andrew's friends, Georgina gets smashed in the windshield and the car explodes and she's burned to death. Now there is a word: BURNED. Because that is what happens to Andrew for the rest of the movie to the point where he goes back to his wife. To be fair I didn't think that was necessary because it made me feel sad considering that this would become the pattern for Carol White's life (she would die at 52 to drug abuse). But the film has some funny moments. My favorite scene is when Andrew is filming a commerical with Jonathan (Welles) and Georgina (White) is in the pool wearing only a swimcap and as the cameras roll, she begins to tell about Andrew's misfortunes. Andrew is so upset he jumps into the pool and tries to choke her! In conclusion, INFWIN is a strange movie with strange getups.",1173657600,,1424,4.459770114942529
7893982,4,6305768374,"This film works wonderfully as a timepiece. What I like so much about Winner's films of the '60's is how much he wizzes around the city. We are treated to location after location...so we really get a look at time and place like very few films of the period. Lots of cars and mini-skirted dolly birds with exaggerated hairdo's and eye make-up.

The story is rather lame. '60's London is the star of this show. It's such a time tunnel that you'll feel quite dazed when it's over...but I think you'll be entertained.

Carol White was always nice eye candy. She plays Oliver Reed's girlfriend. She stumbles and staggers through her lines (in one scene she almost falls over, in another she 'reacts' to the people in the room before she even has entered it,) but you forgive her because she had a sort of innocent charm, like this film.

Reed is at his cool best. He was also at his handsomest in 1967. He handles his part with great ease.

Orson Wells camps it up, maybe a little too much. Marianne Faithfull says the 'f' word...but little else.

If you like and/or are interested in '60's London...don't hesitate buying this. Otherwise I'd be reluctant to recommend it.

P.S. Almost forgot, the photography is excellent. So sharp and clear and so very London, 1967.",1081728000,4,1262,4.611607142857143
