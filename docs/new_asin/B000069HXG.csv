1734929,5,B000069HXG,"Another excellent volume from the AYBS? series, also available in two sets featuring every episode from its ten-season run that every fan must own!  On this DVD, the demeaning ways of Grace Brothers are showcased when the staff must sign a book to take their coffee and lavatory breaks in ""Coffee Morning.""  Mr. Mash leads a protest against such archaic rules.  In ""Up Captain Peacock"" (one of my all-time favorites), the granting of executive washroom and dining room privileges to Grace Brothers' most decorated floorwalker become a sore spot with Mr. Grainger.  Mr. Lucas attempts to feign illness to spend a day with his ""bird"" (young woman, in Brit lingo) in ""Cold Store.""  In ""Wedding Bells,"" Young Mr. Grace announces to the dept. he is ready to take a bride and then asks Mrs. Slocombe to meet him in his office.  Could Mrs. Slocombe be the queen of Grace Brothers (who did you think it would be, Mr. Humphries)?  ""German Week,"" where the staff go Deutsch to sell their German merchandise is a fan favorite because of the costumes.  Finally, in ""Shoulder to Shoulder,"" ladies underwear and gentlemen's trousers must intertwine while the ladies department is being remodeled.  A very solid group episodes originally aired in March and April 1975.  The DVD has many fun details. The menu pages are very creative with alternating photos of, in this case, Miss Brahms.  A lift conductor even takes you to each episode!  Of course, every fan will eventually want the entire 2 sets of this hilarious series, so go buy them now!",1073001600,18,1529,4.838461538461538

1734962,5,B000069HXG,"Once again the cast of Are You Being Served? keeps us on your toes with their antics.  Grace Brothers, headed by ""Young Mr. Grace"" (Harold Bennett - who was born in 1899), never seems to be without a bit of trouble.  The episode Up Captain Peacock illustrates this perfectly.  Captain Peacock, after serving 20 years with Grace Brothers, is awarded the key to the executive washroom.  One might think ""no big deal"", but it is to the floor staff of Grace Brothers.  After all, Capt. Peacock is ""just one of them, is he not?""

As always, the great play between cast members and the outstanding writing aimed at your inner ""I'm sure glad I don't work there"" hits the spot.  Are You Being Served? is a true classic, that, as I've said before, is sadly missed by most of America.",1403827200,,774,4.485714285714286

1734980,5,B000069HXG,"As I have already stated I have volumes 1-4 on DVD. The reason I started getting Are You Being Served on DVD is because my PBS station was sold, and they hadn't bought the rights to the British sitcoms. I was so upset, but when I found that Amazon and this seller had them in stock, I was so happy! I have to admit Mr. Humphries is my favorite character! Boy he does make me laugh!
