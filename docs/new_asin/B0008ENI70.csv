8055675,3,B0008ENI70,"Great to see live performances from the 50's and 60's. Good clean comedy.
However makes me appreciate the show productions of "" I Love Lucy"" even more. There stage camera technology, multi-angle shoots, were state of the art back then. But in the right frame of mind red was one of the best. and his artwork will be around for generations.",1231977600,,339,4.573770491803279
8055676,4,B0008ENI70,"Red Skelton hosted a half-hour comedy series Sunday nights on NBC-TV from 1951 to '53. Red relocated to CBS for the fall '53 season. His Tuesday night program was extended to an hour in 1954, but returned to the 30-minute format in '55. The 1963 season saw The Red Skelton Show's permanent expansion to an hour. At the end of the '70-'71 season, Skelton's highly-popular program was dropped by the network, which wanted to court younger viewers. After one unsuccessful season on NBC, Red's TV variety series ended its 20 year run.

BCI's RED SKELTON: AMERICA'S GREATEST CLOWN contains transfers of vintage b&w television programming. Quality varies from quite good to only fair.

I returned them and requested a new one in their place....the same problem was evident with the second order....requested refund.",1199059200,,341,4.590163934426229
