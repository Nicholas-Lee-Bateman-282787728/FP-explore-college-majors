3922712,5,B002FLZM7S,"I happened to meet Josh while at California Superbike School a few years ago. He was a very nice person and great coach, so I wanted to see how he did trying out in AMA. This movie is fun, giving more details about what goes into a successful motorcycle racing career than some movies i've seen about the stars in the big show. The guys at the top are definitely in a class by themselves, but this was cool to see how those not quite there are doing. The front runners are great to watch but it was fun to see the dedication of other riders like Josh and Misty.  Movie has a good soundtrack. Good video. It's not an instructional video on riding, but more instructional for the sacrifices to be made if you want to get to the top.",1336003200,,730,4.177304964539007
3922713,5,B002FLZM7S,"Minor Details is about 4 girls who go to a private school and discover a mystery on their hands! The girls go through their list of enemies and ""friends"" to see who done it! Its a cross between Nancy Drew and Mean Girls. This is a great movie for girls whose parents do not want to worry about fowl language throughout the movie or a movie with bad values. You can rent this movie through select RedBox locations as well as on Netflix. If you looking for another good clean suggestion try ""Your So Cupid!"" directed and with some of the same actors.

The movie also features a great song at the end called Secret Identity by Brittnee Belt. Go check it out!",1303689600,25,655,4.32520325203252

3922806,3,B002FLZM7S,"as of 2010 the movie suggests that the usual poisoning medium against students had shifted from the conventional All Co Hell, Marriage You Wanna, and Lysergic Acid Diethylamide to Ipacac.for family enrichment motives.  Rather too much of an addled motivation for teeny boppers who more commonly do such things as coercing an Honor Student to ride in an overpopulated vehicle without a seat belt so that *she* and only she could be killed when they crashed the vehicle, along with the conventional poisonings to reduce everyone to babbling idiots.  The overt murder referenced demonstrated that ""sober as a judge"" referred to the town drunk in the Bowels der unCoolorado who let the murderous driver off without penalty after that malicious killing of the Honor Student.  One of my greatest concerns as a scholarship provider is HOW to educate the young people in my program to avoid the conventional poisonings.  But the entire story lacked credibility because of those dissonances.  Even so, it was well photographed, constructed for what it was trying to hypothesize, and directed.  Hence it retained three stars despite its incongruence.",1469836800,,1140,5.202185792349726

3922964,3,B002FLZM7S,"I won't go into a long detailed synopsis of this movie.  As I'm sure other people have done that.  Basically this movie takes place at a small boarding school Danforth Academy.  I would guestimate the ages of the kids to be junior high age group.  Suddenly the cheerleaders all are stricken by gastroenteritis, more commonly called stomach flu.  Nothing fatal or anything like that but sick nonetheless.  But the new student, to be honest, I forgot her name found a note warning that the cheerleaders would get ill.  So the cheerleaders were poisoned, duh da dun!  Being a sensible student she decides to grab 3 or 4 friends and solve the mystery ala Scooby Doo instead of turning the info over to the adults.  But to be fair, if you see the adults, the we'll solve it ourselves option seems to be a rational course of action.  I'm specifically pointing fingers at the school nurse and science instructor.  Not exactly stellar examples of their individual professions.

There are many movies of this type that are specifically aimed at the middle or junior high school kids.  The best of these aim to be entertaining for the whole family.  This falls short of that goal in my opinion.  But it isn't horrible.  I've seen movies like ""LOL"" which I didn't bother finish watching because I didn't like it.  This was ok not good.  It wasn't  horrible and it was a Free with Amazon Prime.  That's good enough to merit a 2.5 - 3.  Would I pay to see it?  No way.",1444176000,2,1455,4.536679536679537

3923039,4,B002FLZM7S,Wholesome film perfect for early teen girls. Moral and clean-cut we could use more of this type of movie. Girls at a boarding academy learn to get along and work together to solve a school mystery. The girls deal with jealousy and competition between themselves and a moral message is sent on the value of being sensitive to others feelings. Very cute and fun.

3923064,3,B002FLZM7S,"A cute little movie with cute little girls. Your 9 year old or possibly 10 year old girl would probably like it. And younger audiences both girls and boys would like it. But as for middle schoolers, and yourself, um not really. It can be boring and silly. The plot isn't that great and the acting is okay. But it's not TERRIBLE. It's okay.",1403222400,,339,4.3125
3923065,1,B002FLZM7S,"This movie is incredibly clean, so no worries about crude language or violence, but incredibly clean doesn't have to mean incredibly boring and this movie could have used more action.

There's a mystery in the movie - someone is making kids at the boarding school sick. The main characters solve the mystery based on clues they've gathered throughout that the audience is not privy to. It would have been at least a little more interesting if your guesses on who did it could be based on an actual clue.

The acting is also sub-par. Some of the performances were good but most made me feel as if I were watching a high school production (though most of the actors in high school performances are better than this).

To conclude, if you have incredibly small children who don't have the attention span for a movie with an actual plot, than they will not be disappointed. If you have a child who's at least in middle school, I can't see her or her friends enjoying it.",1402704000,3,966,4.540229885057471

3923143,2,B002FLZM7S,"In this extremely light weight tween film, four girls gather to solve the mystery of sick kids appearing randomly at their private school campus.  The title is actually perfect:  Minor Details.  This is a very minor film with very loose story-telling, the difference between well told decent literature and something just so-so.  At every level, films can be told well, produced well and clean up well.  This extends a 42 minute Disney hour into well over an hour and I couldn't wait for it to be through.  It did not hold my interest, the characters were sleepy characterizations and the story was solved before it began.",1361145600,3,622,4.820754716981132
