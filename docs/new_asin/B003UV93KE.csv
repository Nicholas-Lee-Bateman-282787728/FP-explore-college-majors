Everything that is discussed is done so in the most shallow and uninformative way possible.

this a a ""C"" camera at a $2000 shoot (their numbers) and its operated by a ""person"" with a whisper creepy voice and no idea what to do to make a interesting 50 min.

This is a sad sad bit of film showing people working there dull job (one thing it did portray well!) in an industry that tries only so hard to make a buck while avoiding any kind of artistic or emotional statement with surprising deftness.

Its not good",1424044800,,780,4.426573426573427
