334617,5,6301587383,"This is my favorite movie of all time.  That might not mean much since you don't know me, but believe me I have seen a LOT of movies and NOT ONE compares to this one.  As musicals go, it is the best - the dance numbers  are inventive, complicated, and extremely entertaining; the songs are all  catchy and lyrically brilliant(""Tomorrow,"" ""The Show Must Go  On,"" ""Long Shot,"" ""Put Me to the Test,"" and, of  course, ""Long Ago and Far Away""); the plot is fast-paced and  believable; and even though Rita Hayworth is not my favorite, she  absolutely dazzles in this movie.  Not to mention Gene Kelly at his best -  he was given full artistic liberty with all the numbers, and boy does it  show.  I love this film.  There are no words to describe how wonderful it  is.",955065600,16,763,4.39568345323741

The only thing that I prevents me from giving this 5 stars is that some of the musical numbers are tedious.  I prefer it when the musical numbers move the story along and aren't just fillers for time.  Don't get me wrong, some of the songs do move the story along.  A couple of them seem tedious to the story.  But overall, it's an excellent film and if you are a big fan of musicals then you shouldn't miss Cover Girl!",1499299200,,543,4.264705882352941

334825,3,6301587383,"This is a nice technicolor film. Rusty Parker, played by Rita Hayworth is a chorus girl at her boyfriend's nightclub. The boyfriend is Danny McGuire, played by Gene Kelly. Once Rusty Parker becomes a cover girl for a wealthy magazine editor, Mr. Codair, who sees a strong resemblance between Rusty and an old love called Maribelle Hicks. For Rusty, being a cover girl puts her in conflict with Danny and her chorus job. And Mr. Codair complicates matters as he attempts to give Rusty a better life he could not give to his earlier love interest by connecting her to Broadway and helping her into a marriage with a young producer friend, Mr. Wheaton. It is unnecessary to say how this musical comedy is going to end. I feel that it is quite predictable and you have a feeling that Danny and Rusty will reunite at the end of the film. Never matter the plot, which in this case is just pure frosting.

The strength of this film lies in the musical numbers. Sometimes you get to see Rita Hayworth sing solo (even though it isn't her voice) and dance with the chorus. One memorable song performed by Rita playing the role of Maribelle is Poor John! because it is strictly linked to the plot of the story. She dedicates it to a young Mr. Codair, whose mother has rejected her because of her lower social class status. At other times Gene Kelly teams up with Hayworth. One of the loveliest team-ups is when both, joined by Phil Silvers, sing and dance to Make Way for Tomorrow. The three sing and dance along empty streets at night in a choreography that reminds you a little Kelly's Singin' in the Rain number to be performed years later. Kelly and Hayworth do a second number together at the nightclub, Long Ago and Faraway. In addition to this, Kelly does an incredible number where he dances with himself, or an alter-ego of himself, also done in the streets at night. This number was quite impressive. Again, it reminded me of Singin' in the Rain.

In general, the film is entertaining to watch albeit its predictability; the plot is pretty tolerable to watch while waiting for the musical numbers.",1464566400,,2096,4.586666666666667

334957,4,6301587383,"""Cover Girl"" is a film that almost never was made.  Hayworth had made two films with Astaire that she treasured.  He was not available and the part was then to be cast with a non-dancer. That didn't balance the film.  MGM said 'no' to loaning out Gene Kelly and offered another dancer who was considered too young for Hayworth. Back to the drawing boards.  But Kelly began to push LBM and got his way as long as he agreed to two films that MGM wanted him to make, one a nonmusical. Now, the technical aspects started to get in the way.  Columbia wanted colour. Columbia could get it, but it meant time and money, neither of which Columbia liked to lose. Convenient illnesses held up the start of production.  Then the stars were in alignment, and the movie began, though costumes were still a problem.  Looking for something 'different', they finally decided upon ridiculous hats, which Hayworth refused to wear, but Eve Arden looked fabulous in them. And shooting began.  Then it stopped while everyone tried to figure out just how to film the solo that Gene Kelly wanted to do, knew how to do, told them how to do, and drew a few days of blank stares. And from that point on, all went smoothly.
Musicals should all have such problems if the results are to be this good. What is here is hard to criticize unless one gets truly petty - like how big a stage would a Broadway theatre have to have in order to stage the title number? Yep, Madison Square Garden size, doubled. But it is so gorgeous that one tosses aside logic and lets it wash over you. What is Gloria DeHaven doing in this film when she had already signed with MGM and had far bigger roles? And here, is she even billed? But to heck with all that.
Sit back and enjoy one of the few great musicals that MGM did not produce, and in Wartime, too. Just remember, without  Hayworth, gloriously talented Hayworth (Watch her in ""Separate Tables"" to see the full range of that talent) this film would never, problems or not, have been made.
If you don't own it - and this is my second CD of the film - buy it now.  You'll have to hate musicals not to fall in love with this one.",1431302400,6,2134,4.352644836272041

334960,5,6301587383,"This is a keeper---some friends who had never seen (or heard of it) before, watched it at my place one day. Both husband and wife loved it...(and he ain't your usual ""old-musicals"" fan, if youse get the drift.) The sheer energy, joy, Technicolor dazzle, and classic music make this just plain fun to watch. The cast blends seamlessly well together--Kelly's genius despels any credibility to the initial hesitancy Columbia Pictures had in teaming the relative newcomer with A-lister Hayworth.  Supporting cast, especially Phil Silvers and Eve Arden, is great. It's a typically 40's (sanitized) version of life in 'the theater' but it's fast, it's funny, the tunes are great, and Hayworth---a truly unique star who can win you over with one smile---is arguably the best partner Kelly ever had onscreen. Officially, he once diplomatically stated that his favorite partner was Jerry the Mouse, but Cover Girl may convince you otherwise. They were both naturally talented dancers--their steps here seem effortless and they're just having a slam-bang great time. So will you.

One of the most lavish and successful Hollywood musicals of the 1940s, Charles Vidors COVER GIRL is a breath-taking spectacle that established its stars Rita Hayworth [Gilda and The Lady from Shanghai] and Gene Kelly [Singin in the Rain], as the two most popular actors of their time.

Nightclub dancer Rusty Parker [Rita Hayworth] has a happy life performing at her boyfriend Danny McGuire [Gene Kelly] club in Brooklyn, but her whole world changes once she wins a prestigious Cover Girl contest arranged by a wealthy magazine editor John Coudair [Otto Kruger]. Rusty Parker soon becomes a Broadway sensation, but is fame and fortune a substitute for true love?

Also starring is the legendary Sergeant Bilko himself, Phil Silvers [The Phil Silvers Show and Its a Mad, Mad, Mad World] and the recipient of 5 Academy Award nominations and winning for Best Musical Scoring. COVER GIRL was Columbia Pictures studios first Technicolor musical, and remains one of the finest musical pictures of all time. The Masters of Cinema series is proud to present the film for the first time on Blu-ray in the UK in a stunning Dual-format edition.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: COVER GIRL [1944] was a lavish Technicolor musical with a theatrical background, and showcased Columbia Picture's top star, Rita Hayworth and became much more than that due to the chemistry between Rita Hayworth and co-star Gene Kelly, the innovative choreography of Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, and the musical score by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin, which yielded at least one standard, and several other very good songs. As Tony Thomas writes in The Films of Gene Kelly, ""In the history of the Hollywood musical COVER GIRL marks a major turning point, a transitional point at which the long-familiar concept of the film musical as a string of songs strung together by a skimpy plot gave way to a broader concept in which the musical sequences would form a part of the plot.""

Okay, so maybe Rusty Parker [Rita Hayworth] doesn't exactly have her name up in lights on Broadway, but she carved out a pretty terrific life for herself in the Big Apple and is one of the star attractions in the intimate little club in Brooklyn, plus Rusty Parker has a thing going with the ridiculously good looking choreographer, Danny McGuire [Gene Kelly] who owns the joint. Rusty Parker doesn't just like to stick around with her best buddy guys, especially cracking oysters open every Friday night with them in the hope of unearthing a big, beautiful pearl and especially when they are practically roommates. It's a happy, cosy life. Oooohhh, but there's an itch Rusty Parker can't help but scratch, and when ritzy fashion magazine Vanity puts out an open call for a fresh-faced cover girl, she's right there in line with half of the other twenty somethings in New York.

Rusty Parker ego is not all that bruised when she takes the wrong advice and blows her audition with fashionista Cornelia ""Stonewall""  Jackson [Eve Arden], stepping onto the stage at Danny McGuire's afterwards with every bit as much enthusiasm and pizzazz as ever. As luck would have it, Vanity's head honcho John Coudair [Otto Kruger] happens to be in the crowd, eyeing some other talent, and he's immediately smitten. Turns out Rusty Parker is a dead ringer for her dearly departed grandma, the love of Mr. John Coudair's life, so guess who makes it onto the cover of Vanity in a few weeks later; I know a star is born! Crowds are lined up out the door, Danny McGuire's club is overflowing with photographers, newspaper reporters, autograph hounds, and bouquets of roses, and I haven't even gotten into the whole thing with big-time Broadway producer Noel Wheaton [Lee Bowman] yet! Noel Wheaton has his eye on a new starlet and a blushing bride, transforming a love triangle into a love quadrilateral. Everyone but everyone knows what they're trying to get out of Rusty Parker, but gulp, but what does Rusty Parker want out of all this and we sure find, to the detriment to her up close and personal friendship with Danny McGuire [Gene Kelly].

There is kind of a lot to love about COVER GIRL and I am a sucker for the genre backstage Hollywood musicals, and especially Rita Hayworth in full Technicolor splendour and sure do sweeten the plot. This 1944 film is the first musical where Gene Kelly was given full reign over his choreography and staging, and he makes the most of this early opportunity, including the awesome show-stopping number in which Gene Kelly dances alongside himself! Gene Kelly, Rita Hayworth, and co-star Phil Silvers are seen having such a blast together on-screen, that it is absolutely contagious. The musical numbers by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin, are most memorably for the Academy Award nominated instant classic ""Long Ago (and Far Away)."" There is definitely something to be said about the endlessly charm of pairing Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth together, and they are surrounded by a particularly terrific supporting cast, also the choreography inspires more than a little awe, and the songs are superhumanly catchy. Does it blaze any brave new, previously uncharted territory? Not really, but in a word, COVER GIRL is a great deal of dazzling Technicolor fun, and that is exactly what I want out of a Hollywood musical of this genre.

As an added inside information bonus on the film COVER GIRL, did you know that Columbia Pictures gave Gene Kelly carte blanch over  the making of this film, and many of his ideas contributed to its lasting success. Gene Kelly removed several of the soundstage walls so that Gene Kelly, Rita Hayworth, and Phil Silvers could dance along an entire street in one take. Gene Kelly also used brilliant trick photography so that he could dance with his own reflection in the sequence ""Alter-Ego Dance"" which he achieved by using superimposition to give his ""double"" a ghost-like quality. Gene Kelly, along with Stanley Donen, devised his own choreography.

Another of the pleasures of the film COVER GIRL is the ever delightful and the brilliant Eve Arden, in one of her best performances as a fashion magazine executive. Eve Ardens acid wit and perfect timing keep the over-the-top glamour in perspective. Eve Arden would have a long and successful career playing similar sidekick characters, most notably in Mildred Pierce [1945]. Rita Hayworth remembered the making of COVER GIRL as a bright spot in her sometimes tumultuous life and career. ""We had a sensational time with Gene Kelly and Phil Silver. I knew we had a rapport and they were both so great to work with. It was a happy time. I didn't know we were doing anything special, but you knew it was going to be good because it felt good making it."" Rita Hayworth had another reason to be happy; and was married Orson Welles during the making of the film.

COVER GIRL was one of the biggest hits of the year, and made both Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly into top stars. M-G-M, which hadn't quite known what to do with Gene Kelly in the two years he had been under contract, suddenly paid attention. They next teamed Gene Kelly with Frank Sinatra in Anchors Aweigh [1945], and gave him again a free hand in creating his dance numbers. Columbia Pictures bought the film rights to Gene Kelly's stage hit, Pal Joey, hoping to team Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth once more. But M-G-M refused to loan out Gene Kelly again, now that he had become one of their most valuable properties around at the time. Columbia Pictures eventually made Pal Joey in 1957, with Frank Sinatra in the lead role and Rita Hayworth played not the ing&eacute;nue, but the rich older woman who has an affair with Pal Joey.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Film preservationist Robert A. Harris has said that, from the look of things, the pristine Technicolor elements for COVER GIRL apparently weren't in any sort of usable shape when the film was re-mastered for high definition release. I have had nothing but the most enthusiastic praise to lavish upon the other titles I've seen from the Masters of Cinema that has been brought to Blu-ray discs, and COVER GIRL is dizzyingly of the highest standards. The general appearance does strike me as definitely distinct definition in detail and the optical crispness and clarity can look variable sometimes, perhaps suggesting that this HD master was culled from a variety of sources. COVER GIRL is bright, vivid and an explosion of Technicolor whimsy, especially with its bursts of colour. I would also say wow; this is how all Technicolor musicals should look on a Blu-ray disc. Especially in one wonderful shot of studio-shot fantasy Cover Girl hints at the film it could be. Smoke covers the top of the Technicolor frame like clouds, from which a large winding path leads down looking like it is a few sharp angles away from being pulled from German Expressionism. Rita Hayworth in the most glamorous gown around sashays down this road from Olympus to a platoon of nicely dressed fancy lads looking up to her as a queen. COVER GIRL is really a lovely nice looking Technicolor Blu-ray disc. It is also appreciated as ever that the sheen of grain hasn't been digitally altered anyway, and the 1080p encoded image is totally lavished with a high enough bitrate to accommodate that filmic texture look. There is no wear or damage to speak of whatsoever. The image is without hesitation sufficiently well-defined and richly detailed to outclass anything a standard inferior DVD could ever hope to capture or achieve. The clarity of each film grain certainly speaks to how much care and consideration went into bringing COVER GIRL to the Blu-ray format. I do feel Masters of Cinema did the most masterful job possible in the given likely available elements, and I am thrilled to be able to experience such an infectiously charming film in 1080p Technicolor high definition. COVER GIRL gave me a great deal of dazzlingly glorious experience I have had the pleasure of watching on this Blu-ray disc, and I can certainly understand why those with more of a casual interest might be hesitant to spend the price you have to pay for this Blu-ray, but it is all well worth the cost.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  COVER GIRL boasts a very respectable 1.0 LPCM Mono Audio soundtrack and you also get as a bonus the Music and Effects Track in 1.0 LPCM Mono Audio monaural. Clarity and fidelity don't belie COVER GIRL the age of the film, but is entirely appropriate for a musical of this vintage. The dialogue and musical numbers alike are rendered as cleanly and clearly one could possibly hope to hear. The audio is free of any pops, clicks, dropouts, or distortion. This audio soundtrack is precisely what I would hope it would be and gets full praise indeed. The 1.0 Linear PCM mono track is also in fine shape and boasts a better clarity and dynamic range than you might expect for a film made in 1944 and then again, the makers of musicals did tend to go the extra mile on sound quality, and that's reflected in how good the music and dialogue plays here.
What a shame with all the modern audio technology about, that they could not convert the Mono track into full Stereo.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Gorgeous 1080p 4K High-definition Technicolor restoration presentation.

Special Feature: Baz Luhrmann on COVER GIRL [2016] [1080p] [1.78:1] [4:21] Here we get an exclusive interview with the Moulin Rouge director Baz Luhrmann about the film COVER GIRL. This is a slightly misleading title, is that Baz Luhrmann talks more on the actress Rita Hayworth, with the film COVER GIRL cited only as an example in this  brief but interesting appreciation of her talents as an actress and a dancer. Here Baz Luhrmann also comments on the fact that most people do not class Rita Hayworth as a dancer, but as we witness in the film COVER GIRL Rita Hayworth is a very accomplished dancer. Baz also comments that the other dancing partner Rita has danced with was Fred Astaire. What is also very dramatically cinematography of Rita Hayworth is showing off her poise and especially the way the actress moves, because Baz feels Rita Hayworth is very athletic, strong and moves with incredible grace, but is also incredibly graceful at the same time, but also very effortless in her movements. To show examples of what Baz is commenting on, we get certain clips emphasising the dancing technique of Rita Hayworth. Because Baz only hints at the film COVER GIRL, whereas instead the special feature should have been renamed as Baz Luhrmann on Rita Hayworth.

Masters of Cinema Exclusive Trailer [1944] [1080p] [1.37:1] [2:06] Here we are presented with a Masters of Cinema exclusive Original Theatrical Trailer of COVER GIRL. This Original Theatrical Trailer was created specifically for this Masters of Cinema Blu-ray release, and is a seductive sell and is far superior to what was viewed on the Twilight Time Blu-ray Release.

PLUS: A wonderful printed double sided Blu-ray cover. Sadly there is no information who designed the Blu-ray Cover.

BONUS: A beautiful designed 28 booklet featuring new writing on the COVER GIRL film. It has a brilliant historic look at the film by Farren Smith Nehme entitled COVER GIRL. It has some stunning Technicolor images from the film. It also has a nice section on the POSTER GALLERY which includes quite a few rare overseas posters. All in all this is a totally brilliant bonus.

Finally, the COVER GIRL film is a totally deliriously fun and infectiously catchy musical that makes for a very inspired addition to your Blu-ray eclectic Masters of Cinema library. I've been so wholly impressed with the label's other releases to date and adding COVER GIRL brings you a strikingly beautiful Technicolor fantasy, and I have to admit that this is a brilliant Masters of Cinema presentation. It also shows us one of the most lavish and successful Hollywood musicals of the 1940s, as well the peak in the careers of both Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly. Though it does strike me as a very meticulous re-master of the best quality available of the elements on hand, and the authoring of the Blu-ray disc leaves no room for any complaint. COVER GIRL is still to this day very much a must have Blu-ray disc and I have been blown away by what Masters of Cinema has done with this Blu-ray disc and it has now as you might expect, gone pride of place in my ever increasing Gene Kelly Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

335290,4,6301587383,"Easily the best of Rita Hayworth's musicals, Cover Girl seems to have become a forgotten film, but its one of the best non-MGM wartime musicals, with gorgeous Technicolor, some good songs courtesy of George and Ira Gershwin and at least one standout number, the Shadow Dance, which still amazes with its technique as Gene Kelly dances with his own reflection. It's all the more impressive when you consider that the camera is in almost constant motion at a time when motion control camera systems didn't exist, so the amount of effort put in to matching both the camera moves and the dance steps twice over must have been incredible.

For decades this was only available in black and white due to the deterioration of the colour negative, but the film has been beautifully restored to something close to its Technicolor glory in a fine DVD transfer, though it's well worth shelling out the extra for Twilight Time's limited edition (3000 copies) region-free Blu-ray release which manages to improve on it. While it's certainly not as vivid as crisp as it was when new, considering how poorly the film was treated for years it's easily the best home video presentation.",1361404800,2,1168,4.869346733668341
335291,5,6301587383,"I bought this DVD, not just for it being a musical, but because of the dual story line with Rita Hayworth also playing the part of her own grandmother, in the memories of an magazine tycoon who remembers the first love of his life, and one time fiance.  His memories detail a young show girl (Hayworth as her grandmother), with whom he fell in love when she was part of the musical hall/vaudeville tradition in the early 1900's.  The music hall scenes provide an excellent example of those traditions... and you get that bit of history for free along with the more modern early jazz era script pairing Kelly and Hayworth.

In the story, Gene Kelly is a show director/choreographer with Hayworth as his star performer.  The chemistry between them, and Phil Silver's as the pianist for rehearsals, is classic film at its finest.  When Hayworth auditions for the cover of the magazine, and is seen by the tycoon, his memories clash against the love story between Hayworth and Kelly, driving the two apart and Hayworth into the eager arms of another man.  I haven't given any particular spoilers to the plot.  I've hopefully given you enough information to wet your whistle, get a copy and see the resolution of this entertaining piece which shows Hayworth as one of the few female dancers to be paired with Gene Kelly.  I saw this first when I was a kid (1960-ish), and a few times thereafter.  When I saw it on DVD, for me it was a MUST HAVE.  If you are part of the population that loves musical theater, a good story line, comedy and drama as well as great dancing..... get this title!  It is probably not one that will ever be recreated for the stage. it would be great. I wish it was rewritten for stage, without any changes.  Updating it to the 21st century would lose the music hall spirit of live performance.  There is nothing from that time to now that could truly replace it, or provide the comic songs and characterizations that are crucial to the story.

Storyline

Rusty Parker, a red-headed leggy dancer at Danny McGuire's Night Club in Brooklyn, wants to be a successful Broadway star. She enters a contest to be a 'Cover Girl' as a stepping-stone in her career. She reminds the publisher, John Coudair, of his lost love, showgirl Maribelle Hicks. He was engaged to Maribelle, although his wealthy society mother made fun of her. Maribelle left John at the altar when she saw the piano at her wedding. It reminded her of the piano-player she truly loved. Rusty is Maribelle's granddaughter and there are musical sequences with Maribelle dancing to songs from the beginning of the 20th century. Rusty lands on the cover of her grandmother's former fianc's magazine (as a bride). She is pursued by Coudair's pal, the wealthy theatrical producer, Noel Wheaton. He produces a lavish musical to star Rusty, surrounded by real cover girls of the mid 1940's. Rusty runs down a huge spiral into the arms of dozens of men who seem clumsy next to her ethereal dancing. ...",1360368000,,2985,4.659047619047619

335293,5,6301587383,"I first saw Cover Girl many, many moons ago when I was a just a teenager who was interested in classic films. At the time, my job at Taco Bell (hey, don't laugh..I was 16 after all) did not exactly afford me with a decent enough salary to buy films whenever the mood struck me, so I relied on the public library for my classic film fix. Since this was nearly twenty years ago, the film was on VHS. Yes, us golden oldies had to watch our moving picture shows on inferior VHS tapes. Oh, the horror.

As I grew older, I found myself working a job where I could actually afford to buy things besides a half of tank of gas and a pack of gum. One of my first movie purchases was Cover Girl - on DVD! Although I hadn't seen it in some time, I was happy to discover that my 16-year-old self did not have completely questionable taste. In a nutshell, the film is about a lovely young woman named Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) who works as a dancer at her beau Danny McGuire's (Gene Kelly) Brooklyn nightclub. Rusty has stars in her eyes and, instead of hoofing it away with Kelly and his somewhat annoying sidekick Genius (Phil Silvers), she tries to take the ""easy"" way to stardom by entering a modeling contest. Shockingly (well, not really), Rusty wins the contest and becomes - yep, you guessed it - a Cover Girl! Danny get a bit miffed at this because Rusty is taking the easy way to stardom. Matters aren't helped when Rusty's new uptown friends decide she's just wasting her time performing in Danny's grubby little Brooklyn club. Heartbreak for Rusty and Danny soon follows but no worries, everything works out in the end.

I'm not a huge fan of musicals in general but something about Cover Girl is just appealing to me. The songs aren't spectacular and some border on corny, but for whatever reason it works. It goes without saying that Gene Kelly was an amazing dancer and he doesn't disappoint in this film. Rita Hayworth is also amazing. I think she's one of the most underrated actress/dancers from that era. Her dancing in the ""Cover Girl (That Girl on the Cover)"" is flawless. No one has looked better running around a stage in a long, flowing gown.

Of the musical numbers performed, my favorite has always been ""Make Way For Tomorrow"", which features Hayworth, Kelly and Silvers. All three are amazingly seamless and make it all look so easy. Another stand out in this film is Eve Arden. Arden was typically cast as the sarcastic but hilarious sidekick which she probably got tired of playing in real life but really excelled at. In Cover Girl, she was cast as Cornelia ""Stonewall"" Jackson, the (you guessed it) sarcastic assistant to John Coudair (Otto Kruger) the editors of the magazine that Rusty poses for. While I'm sure Phil Silver's character was really suppose to be the comic relief in this film, Arden actually fills that role in my eyes. She's also working some pretty fierce hats in this film. Another high point in the film are the short montages. The first one features Hayworth prepping for her ""Vanity"" magazine cover shoot - it's all pure 1940s glamour. The other is a montage featuring women ""posing"" for various magazine covers.

While I do love Cover Girl and watch the DVD often, the release itself was kind of disappointing. Unless a older film is one those classics that frequently pops up on those ""Best Films Ever"" lists, most are released with no frills. Cover Girl is no exception. The only special feature in this release are three film trailers. Ah well, such is life. Cover Girl is still a great film and one of those movies I'll probably watch until I can't remember how I discovered it.",1358812800,5,3627,4.558282208588957

This is the film that features the famous Alter-Ego Dance where Kelly dances with himself. It is spectacular, especially considering this was accomplished without any computer graphics or other modern enhancements. (Stanley Donen is credited with coming up with the concept for the routine at the unbelievable age of 20!)

335394,5,6301587383,"Manuel Puig wrote a novel named ""Betrayed By Rita Hayworth,"" where reference was made to Rita Hayworth's role in ""Blood and Sand"" depicting her as a man-voracious opportunist who rejects Tyrone Power after he is no longer the matador of the day. Power gets gored by a bull, and dies, and Hayworth triumphs wickedly with a new man. In ""Cover Girl"" the theme is similar--to a point--but the film ends up happily. Hayworth is in thrall to becoming a star, and begins by moving away from her long-time friend Gene Kelly. She makes it big, and soon becomes engaged to a big-money man. Nevertheless, amid a swirl of enchanting George Gershwin-Jerome Kern musical numbers, she gets sense at the altar, tells him she cannot marry him, and returns to Kelly. Kelly is not betrayed, and friendship triumphs.

This is a landmark film that could not happen today. We have become too ""sophisticated""--too jaded--in truth, the spirit of sentimentality has become too petrified within us. We no longer laugh or cry so easily. It would not be ""cool"" to like this film too much, today. Yet I find it a breath of fresh air, and a reminder that once we were in touch with our humanity. It captures the spirit of the forties, and the freshness for experience that was extant then. Hayworth and Kelly are in their prime, and Phil Silvers bolsters them. Even Otto Kruger, as an easily deluded producer who once fell for Hayworth's grandmother, is supportive, and Eve Arden's humorously sarcastic commentary provides balance. It is a happy film that stands out as it jogs memories.",1301529600,6,1557,4.788104089219331
335395,1,6301587383,"Awful songs and plot.

I stopped it halfway because it was so bad and then finished it about 6 weeks later.

Phil Silvers is supposed to be funny, but his character is just pathetic.

Rita Hayworth's songs (not really her singing) are done in a style which thankfully hasn't lasted.

The love triangle: will Rita Hayworth's character choose riches by marrying a Broadway producer and dancing on Broadway, or will she marry the Gene Kelly character and dance on his stage in Brooklyn instead?

She never discusses just working with the Broadway producer while marrying the Gene Kelly character.  The movie just treats it as a given that she needs to choose the same man for her romantic-and-professional interests.

I didn't even like how Rita Hayworth looks in this movie.  Wearing 1940s makeup with lots of blush while being shown in Technicolor, isn't flattering for her.

""Singin' in the Rain"" was great because the Donald O'Connor character was admirable and the Debbie Reynolds character was appealing.  Their counterparts in ""Cover Girl"" (Phil Silvers, Rita Hayworth) not so much in this movie.

335397,2,6301587383,"Like 'Singin' in the Rain', 'Cover Girl' has a trio of two guys and a girl. In 'Cover Girl', Phil Silvers (Genius) is the comic relief. He corresponds to Donald O'Connor's funny man part in 'Singin in the Rain'. In Cover Girl, Gene Kelly's love interest is Rita Hayworth and in 'Rain', it's Debbie Reynolds. That's where the comparison ends.

Whereas ""Singin' in the Rain' is a classic American movie musical, 'Cover Girl' is mediocrity incarnate. The story isn't very complicated. Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) is a dancer in Danny MacGuire's low-rent nightclub in Brooklyn. Rusty decides to enter a Cover Girl contest sponsored by a wealthy publisher, John Coudair, who made an unsuccessful play for Rusty's grandmother years ago. Coudair introduces Rusty to Broadway producer Noel Wheaton who makes her into a star. Danny feels slighted when Rusty starts showing up late for rehearsals at the nightclub and decides to close the club down and go on the road entertaining the troops along with his sidekick, Genius. At the last minute, with Rusty at the altar with Noel, she realizes the error of her ways and runs back to Danny. They live happily ever after.

Gene Kelly has the least developed part in the movie. All we find out about him is that he owns a nightclub and is madly in love with Rusty. Coudair and Wheaton act like besotted teenagers toward Rusty and Phil Silvers delivers some thoroughly goofy but unfunny shtick. The most interesting aspect of Rita Hayworth's performance is the scene in which she gets drunk. This foreshadows what happened to her in real life. Anyone who has read her biography will learn that she disliked Hollywood, pined away for a normal home life which she could never attain but eventually began drinking and ended up with full-blown Alzheimer's during the last years of her life.

Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful. Gene Kelly has only one really excellent dance number and that's the scene where he dances with his 'alter ego'. Earlier, the trio has another number which is a pale precursor of 'Make em Laugh' from 'Singin' in the Rain'.

The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal. A couple of decades later, Raquel Welch had the same problem. Both actresses later in their careers would always try and find scripts that showcased their acting abilities. They wanted to be known as 'actresses' and not 'pinup girls'. Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.",1236988800,2,2563,4.831435079726652

335510,4,6301587383,"Easily the best of Rita Hayworth's musicals, Cover Girl seems to have become a forgotten film, but its one of the best non-MGM wartime musicals, with gorgeous Technicolor, some good songs courtesy of George and Ira Gershwin and at least one standout number, the Shadow Dance, which still amazes with its technique as Gene Kelly dances with his own reflection. It's all the more impressive when you consider that the camera is in almost constant motion at a time when motion control camera systems didn't exist, so the amount of effort put in to matching both the camera moves and the dance steps twice over must have been incredible.

For decades this was only available in black and white due to the deterioration of the colour negative, but the film has been beautifully restored to something close to its Technicolor glory in a fine DVD transfer, though it's well worth shelling out the extra for Twilight Time's limited edition (3000 copies) region-free Blu-ray release which manages to improve on it. While it's certainly not as vivid as crisp as it was when new, considering how poorly the film was treated for years it's easily the best home video presentation.",1198886400,5,1168,4.869346733668341
335511,5,6301587383,"This is one of the popular musicals of the war years (1944), starring Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly. This love story is a comedy drama about a chorus girl named Rusty ""Chicken"" Parker (Rita Hayworth) working at McGuire's club owned by her boyfriend Danny McGuire (Gene Kelly). Columbia Studios made this a showcase for Rita Hayworth, but gave Gene Kelly control over the film, especially about dance routines, singing and choreography.  The film has lavish costumes, great dance routines, and excellent music. Several dance routines performed by Danny and Rusty includes songs by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin. The classic song ""Long Ago and Far Away"" won the 1944 Academy Award for best musical scoring. Danny's dance with Rusty; ""Put Me to the Test"", or the joyful dance ""Make Way for Tomorrow"" (with Genius) is simply outstanding and very entertaining. Phil Silvers as Danny's sidekick ""Genius"" has performed brilliantly; although he is known for his comedy routines (as Sgt. Bilko in the TV series); he fits perfectly in dance and singing routines with Danny and Rusty.

Everything goes well at the McGuire's club until Rusty is offered to model for the popular magazine ""Cover Girl,"" by a wealthy owner John Coudair (Otto Kruger). Soon it comes to light that he had loved Rusty's grandmother, and lost her in his bid to become her husband. This is an interesting twist in the story but nevertheless the flash backs are interesting, and Rita Hayworth looks adorable in 19th century costume. During this time Rusty is introduced to Broadway producer Noel Wheaton (Lee Bowman), who is attracted to Rusty; he proposes to her, and Rusty accepts his proposal. In the end she has a change of heart and realizes that she loves Danny. She goes in search of him who is now entertaining troops with Genius. At the end the two lovebirds get back together with some help from Genius. This is a classic love story in which Rita Hayworth is dazzling. The chemistry between Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth is perfect. The story is well crafted to show the simple life of a chorus girl. When she hits the stardom and becomes famous; at the height of her success she finds something is missing in her life, the joys of simple life at McGuire's club. Lauren Bacall in her autobiography revealed that she was first offered the title role, but she tuned it down. The studios could not have made a better choice by offering this role to Hayworth. After this movie, she became a ""pinup"" girl fantasized by GIs during WW II, which was a huge publicity for the studios. In direct competition with Columbia Pictures, 20th Century Fox Studios discovered Betty Grable as a fantasy girl for GIs. This movie is the first successful work of director Charles Vidor, who went on to make such classics as Gilda (Rita Hayworth), A Song to Remember (Cornel Wilde), and Love Me or Leave Me (Doris Day). This movie is highly recommended to all fans of Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly.

335513,3,6301587383,"I've been an avid watcher of old movies for about a year now, and I'm coming to the conclusion Technicolor musicals just aren't my cup of tea. I prefer film noir- give me dramatic, semi depressing, black and white movies anyday over movies like this. This is not to say this movie is bad, it's not, but there's nothing special about it. Entirely too long with outbursts of dance and song typical to a true musical. In musicals, people always feel the need to suddenly get up and sing about every emotion they're feeling, and I find this somewhat lackluster. The plot interested me, as I have a weakness for movies that explore the underbelly of show stardom thrust upon newcomers, but not in the cheery Technicolor fashion this film portrays. But what can I say, maybe 'Gilda' would be more my cup of tea. As for me, I'll leave the cheesy song and dance routines to someone else.",1178236800,5,879,4.534591194968553

However, this one stars the magnificent, beautiful, and truly talented Rita Hayworth, our 'girl', Rusty  in this one.  I hadn't seen any of her films, but have always been a big fan of movie musicals and actresses from that generation.
""Cover Girl"" makes me want to seek out more of Rita Hayworth.",1177632000,2,460,4.585365853658536
335515,5,6301587383,"To further her career, Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) enters a COVER GIRL contest. Keys to unlocking certain Broadway stardom are her grace, face, and talent. Rusty's ontogenesis challenges the budding romance with nightclub owner Danny McGuire (Gene Kelly). Rusty must decide between her familiar fellowship and the aristocrats who disdain them but wield control over her ambitions.

A dance number called ""Alter Ego"" finds a parallel in the careers of Rusty Parker and her grandmother Maribelle Hicks. In Alter Ego, Gene Kelly dances with a reflection of himself in a manner that transcends 1944 technology and, according to Kelly, is the most difficult film sequence he's ever done. I had to back it up and watch again in amazement. With the exception of this scene, most song-and-dance routines are in the appropriate on-stage setting -- no hokey dancers jumping out of unexpected places. The romantic comedy musical COVER GIRL established Kelly as a choreographer extraordinaire!

335656,5,6301587383,"This is arguably Hayworth's best-remembered musical, and it has such great dancing in it!!

Let's start with that title number 'Cover Girl': after the male chorus sings and we are presented with about a dozen of the leading models of the day, the camera opens on Rita wrapped in gold with CLOUDS floating about her... she peels off her wrap and slowly floats down what turns out to be a HUGE, WINDING RAMP THE SIZE OF A MOUNTAIN, slowly gathering momentum as the music begins to boom, eventually running down AT FULL SPEED to join the male chorus at the bottom. There she effortlessly does spins, backdrops, and one-footed lifts, her red hair flying about her, her beautiful body shown off in a flowing, strapless gold gown-- a vision of sparkling red and gold...they REALLY don't make movies like this anymore!!

This is one of the best and most popular musicals of the forties. Columbia Pictures spared no expense on this film, and it shows. COVER GIRL is a rich and elaborate film.

The next most memorable number for me is 'Long Ago and Far Away' a beautiful, emotional breakup/makeup duet between Hayworth and Kelly and one of the best remembered songs of the 1940's. There is genuine chemistry between the two (you can see Kelly's eyes pop at Hayworth as they sing the last verses together) and as the music takes them over there's a long sensuous hug, and a trance-like number of steps between the two that leads to Hayworth swooning deeply into Kelly's arms...rapturous.

Hayworth and Kelly also have a challenge-tap duet to 'Put Me to the Test'. The two (both dressed in varying shades of green!) tap, jump, and spin all over the stage in a fast paced, complicated routine choreographed by Kelly.

Then there's the 'Make Way for Tomorrow' tap dance with Hayworth, Kelly, and Phil Silvers, a joyous tap dance in the streets (Kelly would later use this theme many times in his career) and the celebrated 'Alter Ego' solo for Kelly...I could go on and on.

The music by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin is wonderful. The scoring of this film won the Oscar that year (1944). There's also flashbacks to the 1890's(with Hayworth playing her grandmother), really a mini gay 90's musical is in this film-- we have 2 films in one!!

The rich technicolor is stunning, the designs and COLORS of the costumes are incredible. Kelly, Silvers, Eve Arden, Otto Kruger, all wonderful. But the film belongs to the beautiful and talented Rita Hayworth, who truly was a goddess in the flesh!!!",1152835200,9,2478,4.7354988399071924

With Rita Hayworth, Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers at the top of their form and with words and music by the Gershwins, this is about as good as it gets. Of the great female dancers in movie musicals, there is Rita Hayworth, Cyd Charisse, Leslie Caron and a few others. Trained as a dancer since childhood, Hayworth always was right up at the top of the list. This movie shows why. And of course, she's drop-dead gorgeous and a darn good comic actor. Gene Kelly's dance with his alter-ego in this movie may not be as famous as his Singin' in the Rain number, but it should be!  Try it. You'll like it!",1128470400,7,754,4.2
335659,5,6301587383,"If you can get past the zany (and tiresome) antics of Phil Silvers and the corny, cliched script, there's a wonderful Technicolor musical here called ""Cover Girl"". Gorgeous Rita Hayworth is Rusty Parker, a nite club chorine who becomes the toast of Broadway overnite when she's chosen to be the cover girl of Vanity magazine---albeit to the chagrin of the club's owner Danny McGuire (Gene Kelly) who's her boyfriend and her catty co-workers. Hayworth is absolutely beautiful and dances with the most natural grace and elegance ever captured on screen as far as I'm concerned. Gene Kelly's acting is stiff but HIS dancing is what you're watching here as well. Boy, could he dance! He has a great solo number on an empty street where he dances with his reflection from an empty store window. Absolute artistry in motion. Eve Arden, as a talent scout, brings much needed relief to the tired script with her right-on-the-money delivery of brittle comebacks and one liners. She's also outfitted in the most outre' chic costumes and hats Hollywood ever laid out. All the costumes (by the great Travis Banton) are something to behold. But it's the Technicolor that brings things to life and Hayworth who brings the Technicolor to life. In her Broadway debut, she comes running down a seemingly endless elevated platform in a flowing gold gown like a goddess descending from the heavens---her long red hair cascading behind her. Then, after a dance number with chorus guys, she runs back up the platform through a downpour of shimmering sparkles and into a cloud of pink smoke. Sheer Technicolor movie magic. ""Cover Girl"" isn't the best musical ever made, but as a showcase for one of the most beautiful actresses ever photographed in Technicolor and a very nice song called ""Long Ago and Far Away"" it gets 5 stars from me. When you watch this, you can see there was only ONE Rita Hayworth and her grace, talent and beauty are captured in splendor on this DVD print.",1071532800,37,1958,4.830357142857143

Her duet with Kelly, ""Long Ago and Far Away"" is the real highlight in this nimble minded programmer that really took audiences by storm. - people used to be so easy to please!
TRANSFER: Well, what do you know?  After a slew of bargain basement trasfers (though by no means was Columbia's pricing what this reviewer would consider a bargain) we at last get a transfer that's worthy of the digital format.  Colors are vibrant and well balanced. Contrast and black levels are bang on. Film grain and age related artifacts are present but they don't terribly distract.  There are no digital compression artifacts.  The audio is MONO but nicely balanced.
EXTRAS: Forget it! Columbia remains on their penny-pinching kick, but hey - at least the film looks good.
BOTTOM LINE: This is not an outstanding example of the Hollywood musical.  However, it is adept at poking fun at itself and having a good time doing it. For a night of light fluff that will put a smile on your face, I recommend ""Cover Girl"".",1067040000,7,1317,4.720524017467249
335661,2,6301587383,"I know I'll take all kinds of flak for saying so, but this is a dismally scripted, poorly choreographed Technicolor musical featuring Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth, both at their most lackluster.  Phil Silvers is also in here -- also to no great effect.  In fact, Eve Arden seems to be the only actor who even seems to be trying on this one.  The costumes are grotesque, the sets are minimal and even the score - a collaboration between Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin -- is a dud.  Why the movie guides like this one is a mystery to me.  Only one good scene, when Kelly dances alongside his spectral reflection, other than that, you're really better off searching out stronger performances in ""American In Paris"" and other classics.

335662,4,6301587383,"COVER GIRL'S importance lies not in it's originality as a book (it's the backstage Cinderella story extrordinaire), as much as it does in what happened to each of its stars. Gene Kelly was 'loaned out' to do CG, when MGM boss L.B. Mayer didn't have much use for him at his own studio. His performance in this film, coupled with the ground-breaking 'Alter Ego' dance solo (duo?) was so successful that it made MGM take him seriously at last and allowed him to flourish with the yet-to-come hits of ""On The Town,"" ""An American In Paris,"" etc. (he was never loaned out again). Likewise for Rita Hayworth; Columbia had been grooming her for years, but she had done mostly B-level films (except for the occasional musical). CG showed her off as a lead in glorious Technicolor, and paved the way for GILDA, her signature role. Here she and Kelly make a sweet couple, and are at their most romantic in the ""Long Ago and Far Away"" duet. Another standout number is the title song, which pays tribute to all the well-known American magazines and their cover models. Hayworth is a siren in a gold dress, running down a curved runway, with her flaming mane billowing. An absolute dream in Technicolor.",1031270400,16,1189,4.666666666666667

But she knows that her boss and boyfriend, Danny McGuire (Gene Kelly) believes that the easy way to stardom is not the way to happiness. At first, Rusty goes to audition for being the cover girl but when a jealous friend and co-worker Maurine Martin (Leslie Brooks) tells her to act 'animated', she blows her chance in front of Cornelia 'Stonewall' Jackson (Eve Arden). So when Cornelia and her boss, John Coudair (Otto Kruger), go to 'McGuire's Nightclub' to see Maurine, Coudair immediately takes a fancy to Rusty instead! The reason is because she looks exactly like Coudair's someone long ago whom he loved, Maribelle Hicks (also played by Rita Hayworth). He finds out that Rusty is Maribelle's granddaughter then makes her his cover girl and she is suddenly flung into the world of stardom and fame! But Danny and great friend Genius (Phil Silvers) try to get Rusty back on her feet when she starts getting high and mighty ideas. On the other hand, Coudair and producer Noel Wheaton (Lee Bowman) want to give Rusty all that they think is happiness; money, fame, and stardom. But could Rusty ever be happy without the one most important thing she needs, love?
A truly dynamic movie with terrific dance numbers, hilarious humor, romantic romance, and dramatic drama. Who can't help but hum along when Kelly and Hayworth sing the lovely song, ""Long Ago and Far Away"", laugh when the three main stars do their 'come on pearls' bit, sigh in happiness whenever Kelly and Hayworth kiss, and be in agony at the part where Hayworth realizes her mistake? If you haven't seen this movie, I can only say that you're missing out on a lot!
My favorite dance/song numbers are:
""Long Ago and Far Away"": The romantic dance number with superb Kelly and Rita Hayworth.
""Who's Complaining?"": Phil Silvers is just totally hilarious!
""Alter Ego"": Gene Kelly is the best! Want proof? Watch this number where he dances with himself!
""Put Me to the Test"": Both versions are wonderful. One is with Kelly and Hayworth, the other one is a much funnier version with Kelly and Silvers.
