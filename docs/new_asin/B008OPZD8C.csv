5175841,5,B008OPZD8C,"I was excited for the movie when I saw that it starred the phenomenally talented Tom Hardy. My hopes were high, but wasn't sure what to expect. It was better than I ever could have imagined. The entire cast was stellar. It was so well paced throughout the entire film. It was suspenseful, dramatically engaging, and humorous at the perfect moments. The violence was very intense and realistic. Couldn't speak more highly of this film. It's a must see!",1348185600,2,451,4.7215189873417724
5175842,3,B008OPZD8C,"LAWLESS, the second collaboration between Director John Hillcoat and Writer/Composer/All-Around Weird Dude Nick Cave, is a film that has just about everything working in its favor: It has a trememdous cast, some excellent and vibrant performances, some crackling scenes of dialogue and some beautiful scene composition. So why can't I get past everything that it doesn't have that it needed to put it on the same level as their first collaborative effort, an amazing and little-seen film called THE PROPOSITION?

LAWLESS, based on a book of non-fiction called ""The Wettest County In The World"", is based during the later years of Prohibition in Franklin County, Virginia and based around the Bondurant brothers, who became a little less than folk-heroes and a little more than outlaws during those years. They, like many of the families in Franklin County, are Moonshiners and they're pretty good at it. The eldest, Howard (Jason Clarke, most recognizable for his recent turn in the excellent but short-lived THE CHICAGO CODE) is a strong-armed but dull-witted man who samples a little too much of his own product. The middle child is Forrest (Tom Hardy, best known for just about every other film in the last two years), who is something of a legend amongst the community already for being ""immortal"", by surviving the illness that killed their parents when he was just a boy. Jack (Shia LaBeouf, discarding most of his annoying mannerisms here) is ""the runt of the litter"", skinny and scared, but brainy and ambitious and anxious to prove his worth in the family business to Forrest who really runs the show. They are put upon by a Federal agent or ""Special Deputy"" named Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce, who also starred in THE PROPOSITION) who is looking not to clean things up Eliot Ness style, but looking to make a buck by shaking down the locals for protection money. This leads the local law to side, at least for a while, with Rakes, as Jack and his best friend Cricket (Dane Dehaan) look to sell their goods to a big-time gangster (Gary Oldman) and also romance a young preacher's daughter (Mia Wasikowska). Another unusual visitor comes to town in the visage of Maggie (Jessica Chastain), looking to escape the hustle of the big city and soon finds herself caring for Forrest in a way she never would have expected.

The film's biggest strength is also one of its main failings, and that's the setting. The incredibly rural setting of a Prohibition-era drama is something that is not seen very often, because the majority of them take place in the big cities (although a film like Sam Mendes' ROAD TO PERDITION is partially set in the boonies), and that's something that a director like Hillcoat and a writer like Cave would feel like they would want to immerse the viewer into that world, but we only catch glimpses. It seems like the setting is more incidental rather than a necessary part of the storytelling. Everyone in it is good with really three stand-out performances: Tom Hardy is excellent as the soft-spoken but deadly Forrest who acts as the patriarch for his brothers; Guy Pearce is amazing and chameleon-like as the needlessly sadistic and sweet-scented Rakes who is trying to be the city gent, but is too brutal and cruel to ever be accepted as such. Every scene of his drips with menace. Also standing out here is Dane Dehaan (wonderful in the brilliant little-seen gem CHRONICLE) as Cricket, the resident mechanical genius and hero-worshipping child whose vulnerability is extended beyond that of a cliche. LaBoeuf takes his time with his character in building it and turns in a very commendable performance in easliy his most complex role yet. The rest of the cast work best with what they have but what they have isn't much. Mia Wasikowska has a wonderful scene with LaBoeuf as he takes her out for a drive, but that's really the extent of her character as something for the young Jack to long for. Jason Clarke is the most short-changed of the Bondurants here, being portrayed as a drunk and a thug, but little else. Gary Oldman has little more than a cameo in this film, and from a completely subjective point of view, I wanted more because there was something there to really allow for him to have fun and cut loose like we had seen in years past. Sadly the one player here that is the most marginalized is Jessica Chastain. She's an actress that will undoubtedly have an Oscar in her hand before the decade is out, and she does some really good work here, but her character of Maggie is very much the weary and damaged madonna/whore for Forrest, and very little else.

Another real problem is the pacing of the film. It's not that it's uneven; it's that it's too fast. This film moves along at such a brisk pace that at its little over 100-minute runtime seems too brief for a film of this type. I felt like I was being rushed out of the theater rather than being invited in to experience something unusual and lyrical, like Hillcoat and Cave's THE PROPOSITION. That was a film that took the Western out of the ""Old West"" and placed it in Austrailia's Outback, and it invited the viewer to really soak in all the elements of the environment the film was set in, which were strange and wonderful and terrible. This is honestly the first time in a while where I felt that a longer runtime would have benefitted the film, particularly from a character standpoint.

LAWLESS, while being beautiful to look at and well-performed, is sadly lacking heart and soul that could have easily elevated this film to greater heights. But in all fairness, when LAWLESS works, it works really well, and that does happen slightly more often than not.

3/5 Stars.",1347753600,4,5673,4.749492900608519
5175843,5,B008OPZD8C,"Oscar season has officially begun with the arrival of ""Lawless"", the best movie of the year so far. The movie is based upon a 2008 novel ""The Wettest County in the World"", written by Matt Bondurant, who is the grandson and grand nephew of the characters depicted in the film. The film, set in prohibition-era Franklin County, Virginia, is an authentic and truthful depiction of life as they knew it in bootleg heavy, depression-era Virginia.

The story centers around the Bondurant brothers, Forrest (Tom Hardy), Howard (Jason Clarke) and Jack (Shia Lebeouf), Jack being the younger and more timid of the three. In fact, Forrest and Howard, can not at all be described as anything close to timid.

Prohibition is in place, yet moonshine is run back and forth from county line to county line without any trouble. There's an unwritten acceptance of a business that hasn't really caused any trouble. Yet, things are beginning to brew in Chicago with many now well known gangsters thriving, the government is cracking down. It is just a matter of time before that crack down reaches them in the hills of Virginia. So, unless the Bondurant's want trouble, they have to begin to pay the government for the pleasure of continuing to do business. That doesn't sit well with Forrest and Howard.

The movie, written by Nick Cave and directed by John Hillcoat is an absolute stunner. Not necessarily for the images depicted on screen, but for the quality of the film, given that Nick Cave has only written three screenplays since 1988. Twenty-four years and only two prior scripts and Nick Cave may just be one of the biggest hidden secrets in Hollywood. Known mostly for his music, but Cave has delivered a tight, can't take my eyes off the screen, Oscar night guarantee.

The authenticity of the film and the beauty of the cinematography is what film making is all about. The creators took us back in time nearly a century and never once do you question its validity and never once do you want to miss a single scene. The humor is perfect and the violence is harsh and realistic. You feel the tenseness and the unpredictable nature of what the film could possibly do at any given moment.

I'm surprised that it's already September and I've yet to see a film that made me mention the word Oscar. ""Lawless"" will be part of Oscar night. Screenplay, direction and performances by Guy Pierce, Shia Lebeouf, Jessica Chastain and Dark Knight's Tom Hardy are all going to be at least considerations. If you like great cinema, don't miss ""Lawless"". Although, this is also one of those movies that will have a nice long life on people's tongues and video.",1347321600,2,2636,4.746724890829694
5175844,4,B008OPZD8C,"I like the movie, but the writing isn't quite as sharp as I'd thought it could be.  I think the world has had enough of Shia LaBeouf by now, too, but if this somehow ends up being his last high-profile gig then at least he went out on a high note.  He would not have been among my first ten casting choices for this role, but I found his presence less annoying in ""Lawless"" than in most everything else I've seen him in.

But this movie belongs to Tom Hardy, hands down.  Anyone familiar with Hardy's body of work knows that he can deliver the goods (""Bronson"", anyone?).  He has such a dynamic and commanding presence about him that you can't take your eyes off him.  When he's not onscreen you can't wait for him to come back.  He was the best thing about ""The Dark Knight Rises"".  In fact, he was the ONLY good thing about ""The Dark Knight Rises"".  He'll get more profile for that film than for many of his others, and that's unfortunate too considering how weak that material was.

Between ""Bronson"", ""Lawless"", and 2011's ""Warrior"" (and shame on you if you haven't watched all three of these), Hardy's place as one of his generation's best and most versatile screen actors is secured.

The other thing about ""Lawless"" I didn't care for was how a few songs seemed to get shoe-horned into the story when simple, subtle background score would have sufficed.  It was distracting.  But Nick Cave wrote a few of those and he gets paid more than just his screenwriter's salary if his songs make it into the film and onto the soundtrack, so there you go.  I noticed the same pattern in ""The Proposition"", another film Cave wrote and contributed songs for.  Cave co-wrote the score for ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" and that music was quite good, so I'm not on an anti-Cave rant here.

""Lawless"" is bloody and violent too, so leave the kids in the other room.  But it's a superior genre piece and worth watching.

And I have nothing against seeing a little female flesh now and again, but I thought Jessica Chastain's nude scene was gratuitous.  I certainly didn't DISlike it, but in my head I was screaming ""Okay, apparently it is time for the obligatory ingenue nude scene.  Get it over with and let's move on.""",1346976000,4,2240,4.497524752475248
5175845,4,B008OPZD8C,"I really enjoy the HBO series that sometimes drags a bit much, but this movie covers drama and action so well in just two hours. Three brothers from Virginia in 1931 earn all of their money from bootlegging. But of course, the mob and the local state officials want their cut as well. This leads to a bunch of killing. You know the drill here, but the cast somehow made this material seem fresh.

All of the actors are great. Tom Hardy (Mr. Bane himself) and Guy Pearce put on acting showcases here. Really good stuff. Heck, even Shia LaBeouf turned in his best performance of his career. I could actually stand him. Jessica Chastain holds her own with the guys and has a nude scene that I wasn't expecting, but no complaints.

There was bloody violence, humor and sex all wrapped up in a nicely flawed, but throughly enjoyable package. Like I said, nothing really new here, but if you enjoy gangster films there is much to appreciate in Lawless. It's one of my favorite movies of the year so far.",1346544000,7,997,4.472527472527473
5175846,5,B008OPZD8C,"*Note* **There is actually more that goes with this review on my blog since I saw an advance screening of Lawless in the beginning of August and met the author of the book this movie is based on, Matt Bondurant. Matt's grandfather is Jack Bondurant (played by Shia LaBeouf) and Howard and Forrest were his granduncles. To read my full post on meeting Matt and getting to talk to him about how his family saga got turned into a movie, do a google search for The Muses Circle, click on Movie Reviews, and scroll down to Lawless.**

I absolutely have nothing negative to say about Lawless. Some critics have complained that while the acting was top notch, the story itself was derivative. Are there elements of the plot that we've seen in other films before? Yes. But does is straight up copy another movie? No. But let's get it straight. The point of Lawless was never to give us something we've completely never seen before. Come on, this is not the Matrix. Hillcoat's vision was to give us a twist on the gangster genre, give us something a little less conventional. So while there were elements that felt familiar, there were also scenes that you just didn't expect; scenes that perhaps you expected to go one way, but ended up playing out completely different. I have a couple scenes in mind but I don't want to spoil anything.

In my opinion, Nick Cave did a great job with the script and the soundtrack. I liked Jack's bits of narration throughout the film. The movie was well paced-- my mind never wandered nor did I feel bored. So if some of you are hesitating to see Lawless because you're worried that the action or scenes of violence are far and wide between, you have nothing to worry about. Cave is more known as a song writer and composer then he is for writing scripts. So I had a feeling the soundtrack was going to be interesting. It was a breath of fresh air. Instead of going with the traditional sound of straight up blue grass, country music (remember this movie is part western, part gangsteresque), he somehow mixed in some new with some old.

Now to the outstanding cast of Lawless. You may disagree with everything I've said so far, but one thing that cannot be denied is the amazing acting in this film, even for those who have less screen time. I'll be the first to admit I am not a Shia LaBeouf fan. Walking into this movie, I thought I was going to have to just ignore him and pray the other actors would be able to carry him. While I still won't be the first person lined up to see his next movie, I have to give credit where credit is due: Shia LaBeouf can act. From his southern drawl to his convincing performance as a boy that still hasn't quite transitioned into manhood, I think he did a great job playing Jack Bondurant.

Jason Clarke who portrays the eldest brother in the Bondurant clan Howard, was a bit overshadowed by other performances, but I won't soon forget those eyes. They are eyes that have seen things that no man should ever have the burden of seeing and it's no surprise why he drowns himself in moonshine. The way Clarke was able to sometimes appear ""tuned out"" out was impressive.

Gary Oldman as gangster Floyd Banner was electrifying, but shorter then expected. It's one of those cases where Hollywood uses an actor's name to draw people into the film, but they aren't actually in the majority of it.

Jessica Chastain is a great actress so I wasn't surprised by her solid, strong female performance as Maggie. I loved how she could walk into a room and instantly remind the rough-around-the-edges Bondurant boys of their manners in the presence of a lady. The other lady in the movie, Mia Wasikowska, who plays Bertha (Jack's love interest) was as perfect as always. She is young but can hang with the heavyweights as she has proven in previous performances in Jane Eyre and Albert Nobbs.

If you are looking for a villain you will hate as much as the characters do in the film, then you will love Guy Pearce's spin on Special Deputy Rake. Pearce is probably one of the most underrated but brilliant actors around and I am glad that the part went to him since Rake as a character is quite interesting. He's from the city, wears perfume, appears to look the part of a gentlemen but we soon realize underneath the nice clothes, coifed hair, and girly smell, there's something not quite...right. Like the gloves he wears and the naked African American girl in his room that he has sitting on newspapers on top of his bed. Yeah...check it out, you will see what I mean.

I think the character that I least expected to connect with was Cricket and the credit has to go to Dane DeHaan. I kept thinking he was the younger version of Leonardo DeCaprio and I don't know why but his performance in Lawless reminded me of DeCaprio as Arnie in What's Eating Gilbert Grape. The physical likeness of the two is uncanny. I can't wait to see DeHaan evolve over time.

Okay, so I had to save the best for last. I promise to keep my praise of this next actor as short as possible since there are really no words that can fully describe his performance. You just need to see it. Tom Hardy was compelling as Forrest Bondurant, the middle brother and the head of the family. I read somewhere that the director John Hillcoat was ""awestruck"" by Hardy's performance. I think I was awestruck when I saw Hardy as Bane in The Dark Knight Rises, but let me say this: I don't need any more proof, he is a phenomenal actor. Any actor that can wear a Mr. Rogers' cardigan and remain sexy, masculine, and still be the baddest dude on screen is just amazing. Hardy always makes Forrest appear relaxed, yet intense. His mannerisms such as the way he walks, talks is a pleasure to watch. Forrest is the glue that keeps everything in his world together and I am not just talking about his importance as the businessman in the family. Forrest has to keep a watchful eye on his older brother Howard who can fly off the handle in a second, who can at times appear tuned out and sometimes wonder if it is all from the moonshine or from the horrors he saw at war. Then on the other end is young Jack, his baby brother that he knows isn't quite cut out for the lifestyle but knowing and trying to convince the youngest in the Bondurant family are two different beasts. I'm not saying Forrest couldn't have been played by another actor, but Tom Hardy brought something special to the character that could never be replicated.

I think John Hillcoat has succeeded in his goal. He has given us a western/gangster flick that feels familiar yet still maintains its freshness. If you're looking for a film with a solid story, great acting, with nicely paced bursts of violence, look no further. Lawless has arrived. But let us not give all the credit to Hollywood for there would be no movie without Matt Bondurant and his novelization of his grandfather and granduncle's legend sized escapades. I read somewhere that Matt Bondurant's one regret was that he never spent enough time with his grandfather as so often happens with young people. That maybe writing Wettest County in the World was his way to honor the memory of the man he knew and the man he wished he had had the time to get to know. Don't worry, Matt. Grandpa Jack would be proud.

5175847,4,B008OPZD8C,"Australian director John Hillcoat brings many of his countrymen with him to film this fact based novel (""The Wettest County in the World"") by Matt Bondurant.  Bondurant's grandfather Jack played here by Shia LaBeouf is the hothead youngest brother of a clan of Prohibition era bootleggers in Virginia.  They make a decent living until a crooked politician vows to eliminate all the small sellers.  He brings in a law enforcement officer from Chicago named Charley Rakes (Guy Pearce).

Rakes is no ordinary federal cop.  A popinjay smelling of perfume with slicked back hair and lavender gloves he stands out like a T-Rex in the hills of southeastern Virginia.  His appearance contradicts his viciousness as the legal hired gun.  While all the local citizenry fall in line, the Bondurants are the exception.  Oldest brother Forrest (Tom Hardy) and Howard (Jason Clarke) are hulking men who essentially want to be left alone.  Alas, they won't be.

As he did in ""The Proposition"" (2005) and 2009's ""The Road,"" Hillcoat doesn't shy away from violence, and aside from a couple instances, it comes with viciousness and realism.  The film does slip occasionally, usually when Jack does something really stupid knowing of their situation.  Even with his youth, his foolishness seemed calculated to get LaBeouf and Mia Wasikowska, as Jack's girlfriend, more screen time.  On the whole the film gives an entertaining vision of gnarly Prohibition era Americana.",1346544000,5,1451,5.175965665236052

5175903,5,B008OPZD8C,This is a great movie to watch. Tom Hardy in my opinion gives his best acting ever in this movie. In fact all the actors give you a great performance in a story based on the book that was a true story as told by a family member. The movie more or less follows the book real well since I have read the book and advise you to do the same. As being from an rural area I can say the director did a wonderful job matching the background to the actual style of life and looks of that time era. Only had one issue and that was of the paved roads. Simply put paved roads back then in the rural hills areas of Virginia were far and few in between.,1519084800,4,638,3.877862595419847

I will go so far as to say that the entire cast,  except for the greatest actor of our time in his own mind Shia LaBeouf, is outstanding.

5175922,4,B008OPZD8C,"This is one hell of a gritty movie, and looks very realistic to the period portrayed. It's not a fun, feelgood story though. It's a tale of bootleggers during Prohibition so prepare yourself for violence and blood. The cast is fantastic with outstanding performances by Jessica Chastain, the amazing and versatile Tom Hardy, Guy Pearce as a nasty lawman, and a surprisingly deep and touching performance by Shia LaBeouf. I would say this is his best performance to date, Oscar-worthy even. I give it four stars, not five, due to the dark nature of the story which at times was hard to watch. If you want a realistic film about moonshiners from the back country, this is it. If you want superb acting, this is it. If you want a comfy night with a feelgood movie and some popcorn, this definitely isn't it. It's exciting, scary and suspenseful but very violent, so pick wisely.

The movie itself is a good, entertaining watch. A bit far fetched at times, but I suppose thats the way family lore goes (the original book was written by a relative of the characters). There was enough action/shooting/crime to keep my husband interested and enough family/relationship/love stuff for me.

I don't get why folks can honestly
say that this film's not good?
It's fact based with brutal scenes
delivered so authentic,
viewers will need to brace for impact.
Hardy & Co. are so convincing in their
delivery, scene after scene,
the viewer forgets it's only a movie.
The Film's era is captured authentically
by the director, screenplay writers
& actors.
Even those viewers who prefer only
artsy-fartsy films will love this movie!
My opinion is that the bad reviews
given by a slim few here,
are opinions only
&
aren't founded on any failings
in the film.
Ofcourse that's MT opinion.
However,
the inability to find this film
instore on the shelf,
may prove my point.
It sells out as soon as it's stocked.
LAWLESS is a must for Home Theater
libraries.

5176156,5,B008OPZD8C,"As one who, over many decades, has viewed too many movies to count, I was amazed at how many scenes in the movie seemed really surprising  and effective in a very original way.  Rich in period and location atmosphere, its well acted roster of characters struck me as fascinating and engaging.  Standouts were the performances by Tom Hardy, Jessica Chastain, and Shia LaBoeuf.  Hardy seems to achieve fabulous results with every part he is given.  This is the second time LaBoeuf has done such strong, committed acting that my original tendency to dismiss him as a lightweight has been dispelled.  (The first of these roles was his explosive turn in the Brad Pitt scorcher, ""Fury'.)  Guy Pearce (always an actor to watch), stylishly portrays a wildly twisted, villainous individual who is so over-the-top that he occasionally stretches credibility; however, the characterization is a bit like a dazzling magic act. One is too transfixed by the sheer theatricality of it to react critically.  This is a dark, often violent film, unfolding in striking locations, with a climactic battle that, although somewhat predictable, packs a mighty punch.  I might have wished that the Gary Oldman part in the story had not been simply cut short after a few key scenes, but I am, nevertheless, inclined to give this absorbing drama a hearty recommendation.",1464739200,,1343,5.040723981900452

5176158,4,B008OPZD8C,"During prohibition in Franklin Co. Virginia, three restaurant entrepreneur brothers operate an illegal moonshine business. Unfortunately everyone wants a piece of the pie, one that they are not eager to share. The brothers consist of Forrest (Tom Hardy), the brains and philosopher of the group. Howard (Jason Clarke) is a berserker, and Jack (Shia LaBeouf) is the shy driver. Jack is sweet on a Mennonite preacher's daughter (Mia Wasikowska) who likes his ""bad boy"" image.

Guy Pearce plays Charlie Rakes, a one sided unlikeable crooked deputy who makes us root for the moonshiners. Jessica Chastain provides a little style to the film as a city girl (former feather dancer) who wants to get away from Chicago and winds up working the restaurant for Forrest.

As things pan out, young Jack must suddenly grow himself a set and take over the family enterprise against the odds. Good acting. High intensity.

5176181,5,B008OPZD8C,"When this movie first came out it had very bad reviews, but for some reason, it caught my attention and wouldn't let go. I suppose it's because my grandpa was a moonshiner in the mountains of West Virginia.

I hesitated to even watch it, but I am glad I finally did. I enjoyed the movie so much that I bought it. It shows a very good history of prohibition in America and based on my part of the country, which makes it even more interesting.

Like I mentioned, my grandpa was a moonshiner and it was a rough life, but he loved it so much that he did it until he last days.

They would monitor the amount of sugar each individual person could purchase, but he knew everyone in them mountains. They were all like family. Everyone knew he made moonshine, so they offered to help him. They would go to the store and buy sugar for him. Sometimes they would sneak it to him during the middle of the night. He only got caught one time during his entire life and he had been a moonshiner since he was a teenage boy. He spent the night in jail and was out the next day.

The three brothers did an excellent job of portraying realistic moonshiners. They showed just how tough they were. How tough they had to be. But they also showed how caring they were.

I would recommend buying this movie. I did and I haven't regretted it once. A person can learn a lot from the movie.",1459728000,2,1364,4.210727969348659

5176233,4,B008OPZD8C,"There's a lot of talent on display here, but it's hard not to feel that the movie ought to have been a little better than it turned out to be.  The story is based on a novel written by Matt Bondurant about events in Franklin County, Virginia at the time of Prohibition, and it recounts how three Bondurant brothers and their helpers managed -- sort of heroically, I suppose -- to supply the surrounding countryside with moonshine while corrupt law-enforcement agents (some Federal ones) tried to bring down the operation when the brothers refuse to cut them in on the action.  It's really a Robin Hood kind of story, for the brothers are lawless, to be sure, but the law -- in the shape of Special Deputy Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce) -- is even more lawless, if possible, and so there's no one for the audience to root for but the outlaws.  It's on one level a story of escalating confrontations, ending with a climactic gun battle at a blockade at a covered bridge (very well choreographed), and the director, John Hillcoat, and screenwriter Nick Cave, give the escalating action the rhythm of an old ballad, with images of wooded pastoral scenes and picturesque rustic dwellings interspersed with scenes of very bloody violence that would be perhaps enough to put at least some viewers off.  Adding to the ballad-like quality is the use of old mountain songs that move us along through narrative transitions, written and performed in the manner of the period, with the voices of Emmylou Harris and Ralph Stanley well deployed.  The larger world outside Franklin County is hinted at  -- Forrest Bondurant (Tom Hardy), the oldest brother, made it through World War 1, and there are allusions to the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl -- but these circumstances are only touched on.

The weakness of the movie might be in the handling of the characters.  Forrest is almost deliberately inarticulate, a slow-moving, bulky man with a cold-blooded streak when he's attacked.  Hardy plays him compellingly, but he's more a physical presence than anything else.  Jason Clarke is Howard Bondurant, the middle brother, and he isn't really characterized at all.  The main focus is on Jack Bondurant (Shia LaBeouf), as he develops from a teenager who wants to be in on the action and yet cannot summon up the violence needed to survive.  Jack's narration at times in the story contributes to the ballad atmosphere, but for me LaBeouf isn't really a compelling enough presence for us to find him very interesting.  The fact that he's in the frame with Hardy, Gary Oldman, and Guy Pearce is challenging.  Oldman has a cameo as Floyd Banner, another local criminal who has an uneasy relationship with the Bondurants for much of the movie, and he carries it off with characteristic panache.  Pearce's role as a Special Deputy is a large one, and the character is conceived flamboyantly, and Pearce carries it off in great style -- as despicable a movie villain as you'll see, and to an extent, he dominates the movie.  Jessica Chastain and Mia Wasikowska are the women the Bondurants are interested in, and both do well, though Wasikowska's role is somewhat stereotyped.  I had just seen Tom Hardy in ""The Drop,"" and I liked that movie better.  This one is a different genre, of course, and it's good to look at but lacking something at the center.",1449014400,,3332,4.795454545454546

So I was very pleased to rent it online for 48 hrs. and watch it. It was a good filler for an evening with a lot of rural bootlegging action from the late 1920s to early 30s. Good ole boys with ethics fighting over-zealous and corrupt g-men. What could be better and more germane to our currant times? I liked it.,1441324800,,441,4.080459770114943

Based on the true story of three indestructible brothers beating the depression by brewing the best moonshine in Virginia and waging a war with a hypocritical, corrupt cop.

What did I think?

Theres a lot to like about Lawless. But thered be a lot more to like with some better editing in the first half  it drags like a tarred and feathered redneck being pulled behind a pick-up truck. Once it picks up, you're in for an engaging tale of a boy becoming a man in a brutal world.

Shia LaBeouf and Guy Pearce must have wet their pants when they read Nick Caves script  their roles are actors dreams come true.  Theres cussin and graphic violence and smokin and gun-totin gangsters and graphic violence and creepy corrupt cops and friendships broken and love found and graphic violence and graphic violence.

5176358,5,B008OPZD8C,"Another one of those films that you need to watch more than once.  This is the story of three brothers, two romances, and moonshine business during Prohibition, with incredibly interesting work of a stellar ensemble cast.  The details that the actors--especially Tom Hardy and Jessica Chastain--place into their portrayals of the characters absolutely make the film.  Totally enjoyable.  Hardy placing his hat onto the bar as he is about to give his younger brother a lesson in holding respect--sublime.  His communication of control in another ""hat"" scene with Jessica's character--that he does it, and how he does it, with all due deliberate care--is just delicious.  And Jason Clarke--the oldest brother--'s reaction was perfect.
The tiny details, the postures and slight but clearly communicative body shiftings to convey volumes about family understanding, and the manipulation of fear and control in what is nothing less than a local war...were masterful.  Many small bits of dialogue that can be interpreted in different ways...this is the writer and director's beautiful realization of art that pulls you back in, again and again, to experience and to contemplate the moments and details of life that make it endlessly interesting if you just attend.

Highly recommend.",1425081600,,1277,5.381909547738694

5176393,3,B008OPZD8C,"Sometimes I really get ticked off at Hollywood. This could've been an outstanding film, but alas, artistry was snuffed for formula. But, hark, there is hope! Three key artistic elements came together to save this film from formulaic obscurity. (1) The intense polarization of Tom Hardy's protagonist/hero character and Guy Pearce's antagonist/villain character. Hardy is gravitas incarnate on screen. His backwoods protagonist Forrest is understandably at odds with Pearce's sociopathic city-slicker Charley Rakes. We see Rakes from the Bondurants perspective: a very real danger from the outside who threatens their livelihood. There is absolutely zero compromise between these two characters. (2) The film should have been longer in order to accommodate richer romantic subplots between the Jessica Chastain/Tom Hardy characters and LaBeouf/Wasikowska characters. Surface criticism says these characters are forced, but they really add depth and humanism to the brutal world in which they exist. (3) The soundtrack fits in wonderfully and feels authentic to the period. This film didn't blow me away, but it should have.",1420934400,2,1122,5.724550898203593

5176428,5,B008OPZD8C,"Lawless is the true story of the infamous Bondurant Brothers: bootlegging siblings who made a run for the American Dream in Prohibition-era Virginia. In this epic gangster tale, inspired by true- life tales of author Matt Bondurant's family in his novel ""The Wettest County in the World"", the loyalty of the three brothers Jack, Forrest and Howard Bondurant, who sold moonshine in Franklin County, Virginia, during Prohibition in the United States.

Grim, bloody, and utterly flawed, Lawless doesn't quite achieve the epic status it strains for, but it's too beautifully filmed and powerfully acted to dismiss. It had great potential, but due to a poor storytelling technique that causes the film to be rather dull, we merely end up with a film that just looks good. But still,this Prohibition-era crime drama boasts bravura performances, unforgettable characters, moments of shocking violence, and enough in-your-face entertainment that features a unique villain and several great supporting actors such as sublimely evil performances by Gary Oldman as a murderous rival and Guy Pearce as a government agent. As for Jessica Chastain, her performance in this film is commendable enough that her fans would surely enjoy. Between sporadic bursts of very intense violence, there are often drafty, drowsy scenes that struggle to justify their relevance. Overall, it certainly had its moments yet lacks the tension of a real classic.",1416268800,,1428,5.375

5176441,5,B008OPZD8C,"This film has been out for a couple of years, but by reading this review I hope readers who missed it will check it out, because ""Lawless"" is a movie on par with ""Wiseguys"", ""Shutter Island"" or ""Road To Perdition"" as one of the best historically based movies of all time.  That is no exaggeration.
  ""Lawless"" is the true tale of a family of brothers, the Bondurants, who, during Prohibition in the early 1920's, ran a very lucrative moonshine operation out of a remote Virginia county.  That is, until a very corrupt and evil lawman played by the great Guy Pearce shows up and decides to take a cut of the pie.  Unfortunately the Bondurants aren't the sharing type and are not easily bullied.
  The story is gripping, violent and even painful at times, especially in the tit-for-tat brutality that takes place between Pearce and the brothers.  Shia Labeuf plays youngest brother Jack, but in this movie is not very believable, at least in my view.  I don't care for him or his antics off screen.  However, the movie is also starring the great Tom Hardy, the British actor who is taking America by storm, with an amazing depth, ability to change accents from his native British to hillbilly and in ""The Drop"", to Brooklyn-ese effortlessly.  As Forrest Bondurant, the leader of the brothers, he is spellbinding - soft spoken but, when the need arises, a vicious monster that idiots who cross him soon find out.  Gary Oldham plays a bit part, and that's too bad because he's great in the few scenes he's in.
  Hardy could and should have received an Oscar for his part, and one hopes he will get it after his outstanding performance in ""The Drop"".  ""Lawless"" will be a classic tale of corruption and family loyalty.  Don't miss out.",1413936000,2,1730,4.641447368421052

5176455,5,B008OPZD8C,"Entertaining and well acted 1930's era film showcasing the true story of a trio of moonshining brothers in rural Virginia. Starring Shia LaBeouf, Tom Hardy, Guy Pearce and Jason Clarke, and backed by a superb cast of well drawn and captivating characters, ""Lawless"" is both a straight crime story with folk hero overtones and a poignant look at familial loyalty and approval in an era when Prohibition encouraged the profusion of backwoods moonshine stills.

Lawless has plenty of opportunities to become violent for its own sake, but the story of how the three brothers deal with threats to their family business always takes precedence.  Because familial dynamics are paramount, Jack's (LaBeouf) clumsy attempts to emulate his nearly mythical older brother Forrest (Hardy) are allowed to organically develop.  The inevitability of the brothers' criminal life trajectory and the ending are seemingly at counterpoint, but when the ending comes we're both relieved and satisfied.

A few notes about the acting.  Tom Hardy is wonderful as the understated and hulking older brother Forrest, while LaBeouf is simply a treasure in his role as the younger brother Jack.  His ability to convey anguish and love, and finally anger result in his best acting performance yet.

Directed by John Hillcoat from a book by Matt Bondurant (Grandchild of the film's Jack).  Well crafted, emotionally involving, and a brutal but loving insight into this proud family.",1411948800,,1449,5.269565217391304

5176459,4,B008OPZD8C,"Amidst the chaos and confusion that followed the ratification of the 18th amendment in 1919, emerged a group of outlaw entrepreneurs aiming to taking full advantage of the dry times.  Among this group came the Bondurant brothers, Forrest (Tom hardy), Howard (Jason Clarke), Jack (Shia LaBeouf), and their tenacious quest for cash by means of bootlegging moonshine as portrayed in the film Lawless. While some viewers may frown upon the outlandish amount of violence that ensues throughout the movie, I commend director John Hillcoat on his ability to recreate the troubles and triumphs of the risky trade in a sentimental fashion, so compelling, that I found myself both furious and hurt at times.
 The film itself follows loosely the novel The Wettest County in the World, centered on the small town of Franklin, Virginia. Stunning views of the southern countryside seen through a somewhat sepia-like filter give a great sense of setting to the story.  A banjo-infused country western soundtrack also reflects the slow paced lifestyle of the town.  In contrast to that, The Bonderant brothers are almost always hard at work in a world of their own.
 In terms of the actors ability to take on the persona of the Bondurants, all three brothers certainly possess their own unique rendition on the southern twang.  Tom Hardy, the brains of the group, utilizes a more gravelly voice almost as if every sound that comes out of his mouth might be his last.  Jason Clarke, the drunken feisty one, remains rather quiet, though never afraid to lash out and bark at his opposition.  Finally, we have Shia LaBeouf as Jack Bondurant.  Unlike the other two brothers, Jack lacks a lot of the confidence needed to keep the Bondurants reputation in tact.  LaBeouf does a phenomenal job of playing the role of a brother far too concerned with what others think of him in the town. Labeoufs shaky and goofy voice says it all.
 As the film moves on, foes are introduced, the worst of which being special agent Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce), summoned from the city of Chicago to deal with the widespread bootlegging.  Faced with the threat of halting all operations and transactions, the brothers quickly realize the severity of the situation.  Shia LaBeouf begins to grow as a character.  LaBeoufs initial looks of uncertainty are transformed into that of utter confidence.  Along with this maturity comes Jacks ability to swoon the ladies, giving this action/drama film a slight love story twist.
 All in all, John Hillcoats vision for Lawless was far from disappointing.  Everything from the diversity of individuals in the town and their clothing to the engineering of the stills used to make moonshine was on point.  The mannerisms of the brothers echo their merciless attitudes towards the authorities.  Hillcoat gives viewers no choice but to empathize with the Bondurants and their anti-hero attributes.  Lawless brings out the edge in life that people love to feel.  Its a constant power struggle of man versus man, and Forrest Bondurant said it best, Its not the violence that sets a man apart, its the distance hes prepared to go.",1411603200,,3118,4.96917148362235

5176464,5,B008OPZD8C,"Lawless was an action-ish movie with a great story behind it.  Best of all, it was based on a book by the grandson of one of the characters in the movie.

Without being too much of a spoiler, Lawless is an account of a bootlegging family in the hills of VA during the Depression and through Prohibition.  They ran afoul and up against Chicago based crooks who were out for their business and money.  The acting was outstanding with the exception of Shia LeBeouf.  His seemed more ""acting"" than being.  There were times though that he came through but that was the exception rather than the rule.

5176517,4,B008OPZD8C,"Whatever I've seen in my past concerning moonshine running has been on the lighter side. This film takes you in the total opposite direction.

Here's the scoop. Set in depression era Franklin County, Virginia, this story involves the 3 Bondurant brothers who make and run moonshine. A heavy weight deputy from Chicago (Guy Pearce) arrives and is determined to shut them down. Things get out of hand.

This is an uber violent film. All manner of grievous bodily harm ensues. Shootings, beatings and throat cuttings make up most of it. The older brothers (Tom Hardy, Jason Clarke) know their business, while the younger brother (Shia LaBouf) wants to prove himself worthy of equal billing. He's also courting the local preacher's daughter. Guy Pearce is particularly sleazy. There have been several violent bad guys in film history that showed shades of homosexuality. Somehow it makes them all the scarier. That's Pearce. He's referred to as a ""Nancy boy."" And he goes way out of his way to be as violent as possible.

The performances are good. Especially Tom Hardy. I'm no Shia LaBouf fan but he IS getting better. Gary Oldman's role is too small as is Mia Wasikowska's. But Jessica Chastain looks delicious and chews her role up just fine. I like the look of the film. Great attention is paid to period detail. I also liked the music though some of it tried, unsuccessfully, to make things lighter. This is too heavy for that. It's shot really well and the directing is a bit odd. Difficult to explain but it looks as though director Hillcoat always had the camera in some spot that was counter intuitive to where I thought it would be. But I DID like it.

This might not be quite worth the 4 stars i gave it but it's well worth anyone's time. It shows a (probably) more realistic view of what was happening back then.",1403740800,,1820,4.678125

Also, speaking of haircuts one of the main characters looked like he shaved his hair down the middle instead of parting it naturally, it looked really bad as the gap was really wide.

5176535,3,B008OPZD8C,"Set during the Prohibition Era in 1931, LAWLESS traces the fortunes of the three Bondicant brothers - Forrest (Tom Hardy), the brains, Howard (Jason Clarke), the heavy, and Jack (Shia LaBoeuf), the weakest of the trio, as they run their bootlegging business in a rural part of Franklin County, West Virginia.  Theirs is a risky business; not only do they have to worry about rival syndicates, notably that led by Floyd Banner (Gary Oldman), but they are continually harassed by an over-zealous deputy Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce), who is determined to eradicate them at all costs.  John Hillcoat's film explores the tempestuous relationship between the brothers; although perpetually denigrating Jack as the ""runt"" of the family, the other two always stand up for him, especially when he gets into trouble.  Likewise Jack does his best to maintain the bootlegging business, even if it means making an audacious trip to sell illicit hooch to Flord Banner, accompanied by the disabled Cricket Pate (Dane DeHaan).  The film establishes a convincing sense of period, a time when bootleggers either killed or were killed as they strove to maintain their supremacy in an overcrowded market.  Dismissed as ""hicks,"" because of their rural origins, the Bondicoats turn out to be formidable adversaries, even though Forrest tends to believe a little too much in his (self-constructed) legend about the family's indestructibility.  The film is extremely violent, containing at least two stomach-churning sequences, but this is necessary to the depiction of a dog-eat-dog world in which everyone is out for themselves.  The only jarring note in an otherwise tautly plotted thriller is Guy Pearce's pantomime villain: with his immaculate suits and perpetually curled lip, he seems to have wandered in from a Victorian melodrama rather than an early Thirties gangster movie.  We feel that his demise at the end is richly deserved, as Jack finally overcomes his squeamishness about shooting enemies and mortally wounds the deputy.  Howard completes the coup de grace by stabbing Rakes in the back.",1398038400,,2080,5.259818731117825

5176582,4,B008OPZD8C,"Should be 4.5 Stars

Based on the true story of three bootlegging brothers in 1931 Virginia, the film has Actors such as
Transformers star Shia Labour, British actor Tom Hardy and Australian Jason Clarke and these make up Bondurant brothers, who are moonshiners in Franklin County trying to protect their booming illegal `still' operation from a less, than what appears to be, a puritanical clampdown fronted by a Special Deputy named Rakes, a part played with a memorable fury and pristine dandy like Guy Pearce, I might add his acting steals the film.

There are spurts of blood, gangsters and corrupt cops; Lawless does not quite hit the mark and succeed at building convincing portraits of its characters, within the narrative.
The art department have made a convincing period mocking and have added heaps of battered vintage signage and other pieces which add to the colour and smells of the prohibition days. The official sound track is done rather well and is laden with folksy bluegrass songs; please see my separate review of the OST.

Lawless does take its time to the `meat of the movie', after an hour or so, when Jack Bondurant ( played by Shia Lebeouf's ) starts selling liquor to gangster Floyd Banner (played by Gary Oldman, his role is brief) With the beginning of this new partnership the law, both local and state, squeezes in on the brothers.

The film is violent, and the images linger: you will see a man tarred and feathered and dumped on the porch; Tom Hardy's throat being slit from ear to ear; a women who you see at the beginning, of what is implied is going to be a brutal rape, Floyd Banner hitting Noah Taylor with a spade; and by far the worse for me was Pearce sneering in disgust as he gets blood on his lilac leather gloves after bashing Shia Lebeouf's face, who is begging for mercy. The women in this narrative are either victims, gullible or happy house wives. Although On the whole I enjoyed the movie, however, I can see why there maybe detractors.",1387843200,,1987,4.668571428571428
5176583,5,B008OPZD8C,"I remember seeing the preview for ""Lawless"" while preparing to watch another movie. I instantly wanted to see it. Yet, the opportunity passed, and I wasn't ready to buy the DVD until I was certain I would like the movie. Although I was born in the late 1960s, my father was born in 1920. He often said he bootlegged himself to help the family survive as his father was a poor farm laborer. There were three brothers in the movie and my father had two brothers. Forrest Bondurant reminds me so much of my father in his latter years, it's not funny.

Enough of that. On to the movie. Nick Cave nailed the spirit of the book and the music of the time. It was as if we were watching the real events unfold in person instead of on a cable network. I inherited my love of good stories and movies from my father. There was an even distribution of action throughout, and the scene where Forrest's throat is cut was violent, bloody, and frighteningly realistic. How Forrest Bondurant survived that, I will never know. I loved the unfolding romances between Forrest and Maggie. Their scenes were brilliant. Tom Hardy brought the character to life in a way no other actor could have imagined. His Virginian accent was flawless. He was a scene stealer. It was as if he was born to portray Forrest. I was less interested in the romance of Jack and Bertha. Perhaps it was due to the fact that Tom Hardy and Jessica Chastain overshadowed Shia LaBeouf and Mia Wasikowska. The chemistry between Mr. Hardy and Ms. Chastain was unbelievable. Although it was Jack's story, more or less, one cannot deny that Forrest and Howard were larger than life, as were the actors who portrayed them. I found myself cheering for the moonshiners, the supposed 'bad' guys and jeering the law, the supposed 'good' guys.

Nick Cave, who also scored the music for ""West Of Memphis,"" did so with ""Lawless"" as well. He captured the soul of music in those days, and the soundtrack is amazing. If anyone can make it through listening to Ralph Stanley without tearing up during Cricket Pate's funeral, has little heart. At the end, Mr. Stanley sang another bittersweet song that reminded me so much of my father, I cried the first time I heard it. See, in the movie, the brothers fight, but have each others' backs. That makes me think of my father and his two brothers. They fought like wild cats, but when one was threatened, they would all throw in the fight. In all, it was superb and I would give my recommendations. If nothing else, Tom Hardy's performance alone is enough to have this movie in one's collection.",1387584000,2,2576,4.573593073593074
5176584,4,B008OPZD8C,"Story set during the prohibition time. Shia Lebouf does a great as the younger brother of a trio of bootleggers. I didn't give it 5 stars solely because the story seems to drag on in places. I am sure the movie could be shorter if they would just get to the point most times but overall pretty good, perfect for a date or movie night at home.",1387497600,,342,4.119402985074627

The movie features Tom Hardy, Shia LaBeouf, Guy Pearce, Jason Clarke, and Jessica Chastain.  The movie is actually based on a true story about the conflict that existed between law enforcement and the bootlegging proprietors.  The standout from this movie is Tom Hardy, he is an exceptional actor, and it shows in this movie.  Tom Hardy controls every scene he is in.  I also thought that Jason Clarke who played Tom Hardy and Shia LaBeouf's brothers was also very good.

5176608,5,B008OPZD8C,"Some years ago director John Hillcoat and screenwriter Nick Cave collaborated on a film called ""The Proposition"" set during Australia's colonial period that was definitely informed by Sergio Leone, Sam Peckinpah, and Clint Eastwood but had enough original flourishes to stand as a true original.  ""Lawless"" is cut from the same mold except the setting is Prohibition era Franklin County, Virginia.  Bootleg whiskey for generations was the county's primary industry and there was a gentleman's agreement between the manufacturers of moonshine and law enforcement that kept the business thriving.  Where there is a buck to be made, however, there are outsiders who want a piece of the action and they come in the form of a Chicago gangster(Gary Oldman) and a sadistic U.S. attorney(Guy Pearce).  The film focuses on the Bondurant family whose motto is ""We control fear.  Fear doesn't control us"".  The oldest brother Forrest (Tom Hardy) is bloodied but unbowed and will protect the family interests at all costs.  As in ""The Proposition"" Hillcoat doesn't shy away from the violence that's a byproduct of these turf wars.  You get a real sense of time and place with exquisite period art direction.  Cave is also the music arranger and provides a score that evokes Appalachia.  The standout performances here would probably be Hardy and Pearce.  Not for the squeamish but an accurate history.",1380931200,2,1389,5.15625

5176644,3,B008OPZD8C,"A crime drama ""Lawless"" (2012) has everything that would make a great picture: talented players, moody photography, nice soundtrack music, etc. The only thing it doesn't have is a screenplay, one of the most neglected departments in making a movie.

Set in the Depression-era Virginia, ""Lawless"" chronicles the lives of the Bondurant brothers - Forrest (Tom Hardy), Howard (Jason Clarke) and Jack Bondurant (Shia LaBeouf), running a moonshine business in Franklin County. With the arrival of corrupt Special Deputy Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce), their business becomes more difficult, but the brothers will not give in to pressure to bribe.

Unlike Australian-born director John Hillcoat's previous work, a dark, post-apocalyptic tale ""The Road,"" ""Lawless"" attempts to be a serious artistic work that also entertains. The result is a mixed bag. While the visuals are always attractive, the film does not know where it really wants to go, with flat characters whose fates we do not care much. The romantic subplot involving Mia Wasikowska's characters is forgettable. Jack Bondurant's transformation is not really convincing.

""Lawless"" is just another example of how a story based on real-life figures could have been better. (And if you are a Gary Oldman fan like me, remember that his role is a small one, though he does a perfect job.)",1374019200,,1335,5.258215962441315
5176645,5,B008OPZD8C,"This is an amazing account of history we don't really know about.  Especially in California, as we often think of southern culture as one size fits all, and neglect rural southern mountain culture, which this movie showcases.",1373846400,,225,5.081081081081081
5176646,5,B008OPZD8C,"WOW, this movie is SO ENGROSSING that you won't want to miss a minute.  These are Academy Award performances, writing and directing.  If you've seen Tom Hardy in ""This Means War"", you may not recognize him in ""Lawless"" as he so completely disappears into his role as ""Forrest"".  This story revolves around a family of three brothers making hootch in their illegal still during Prohibition.  They are in a county where this is common and draws the attention of the government who tries to shut them all down.  The action is fast-paced and amazingly well-done.  Jessica Chastain is perfect as ""Maggie"", the woman who comes to work at their bar/gas station.  The attraction between Maggie and Forrest is quiet, intense and played with subtlety.  If somewhat graphic violence doesn't bother you, I'd say this is one of the best movies in years.  I highly recommend ""Lawless""!",1373846400,,871,4.910958904109589
5176647,5,B008OPZD8C,"I think I watched this movie 3 times within the first two days of buying it. The fact that the director was able to pick three leads who were able to play off each other so well that you almost believed they were actually brothers was awesome. During the time frame that it's set people aren't allowed to buy alcohol so the brothers create a moonshine distillery and package and ship the bottles of the stuff they create. However a new police officer in town isn't too fond of their business and does whatever he can to stop it however he can. Their is a lot of violence and a lot of action. However, its something you would expect to see if you were alive during this time frame and nothing too over the top like explosions or electronics (maybe one or two explosions). Anyways, I would definitely suggest it.",1373760000,,810,4.406666666666666

5176663,4,B008OPZD8C,"It's a very good film but it has two glaring weaknesses in my opinion.

First, the focus seems to be on the aesthetic over the story.  It's beautifully shot and produced but one feels the visual has to make up for a good, though underdeveloped plot.

Second, I admit to not being a huge fan of Shia LaBeouf in the first place and asking him to carry a film where the ""supporting"" cast includes Tom Hardy, Guy Pearce, Gary Oldman and Jessica Chastain is just silly.  The ""wimpy"" brother also runs the risk of being the most unlikeable of the three, which is not all his fault.  Poor Jason Clarke is given nothing else to do but drink and beat people up!

It's a shame that Chastain and Oldman, arguably the finest actors of the bunch, are saddled with the thinnest characters but they light up every scene!",1371945600,,805,4.405405405405405

5176719,3,B008OPZD8C,"The opening scenes of ""Lawless,"" John Hillcoat's fascinating 2012 work, are so intense they create anticipation the film does not live up to. Tom Hardy plays brother Forrest Bondurant, the formidable protector of a backwoods Virginia moonshine operation during the Prohibition. He has a face-off with a new sheriff of sorts, the preening Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce) who has arrived by way of Chicago to collect toll. Hardy's stare is so intense it practically cracks the camera lens. After barely a pronounced word and the twitch of a brow, you know instantly his savage code is not to be underestimated. It's a spellbinding moment the film rarely matches.

There's a great movie here, a sort of combination of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miller-s-Crossing-HD/dp/B00A8OWOSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miller's Crossing [HD</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winter-s-Bone/dp/B00498YZH8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winter's Bone</a>, but somewhere on the muddy back roads it becomes lost in box office ambition. Based on the true story of the Bondurants, with a screenplay adapted by Nick Cave from Matt Bondurant's memoir&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wettest-County-in-the-World-A-Novel-Based-on-a-True-Story/dp/B001JQB0GC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wettest County in the World: A Novel Based on a True Story</a>, filmmakers cast Shia LaBeouf as the youngest brother -- the runt of the litter -- and primarily focus on his attempts to live the code while courting the preacher's daughter. Such plot developments are as old as James Cagney's socks.

LaBeouf is an acquired taste anyway, possessing boyish looks without the slightest menace. Hardy's presence, not to mention Jason Clarke as the fearless older brother Howard, completely swallow LaBeouf's sniveling portrayal. There's a primitive society here (check out the classic documentary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harlan-County-U-S-A-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000E5LEVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harlan County, U.S.A. (The Criterion Collection)</a>), and Hardy and Clarke capture the palpable nature of such blood cults. You need fingernail dirt, and LaBeouf has the presence of a kid folding jeans at The Gap.

By way of Australia, Hillcoat has sparked an interesting career with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Proposition/dp/B002R1QQ9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Proposition</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road/dp/B003IWRE3I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Road</a>. ""Lawless"" is a step back, though shows signs of considerable post-production tinkering. One suspects the film clocked at three-plus hours and Hillcoat had to whittle down to two. There's a musical montage that shows the Bondurants rolling in moonshine money while Pearce's Rakes destroys neighboring stills dotting the Virginia mountains. It's the moment the film unravels.

""Lawless"" introduces two fascinating characters, including Maggie Beauford, a dame with a past (Jessica Chastain), and gangster Floyd Banner (Gary Oldman), but both are practically forgotten. Chastain especially deserves screen time, working the bar at the Bondurants' rural enterprise and capturing the wary eye of Forrest. There's an unforgettable scene when Chastain, sans clothes, slowly pats down a darkened hallway to his bed, ranking as one of the most haunting snapshots in recent memory. It's the type of image Jean Cocteau would admire (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beauty-and-The-Beast-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00007L4I6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beauty and The Beast (The Criterion Collection)</a>).

Such moments in ""Lawless"" abound. It's a beautiful film, with the extraordinary cinematography of Benoit Delhomme, on-location filming in rural Georgia and brooding set designs creating a lamentable atmosphere. But the plot flow is too fragmented. You know there's going to be a showdown between Forrest and Sheriff Rakes, and they indeed meet next to a covered bridge surrounded by men toting rusty shotguns. By this point, the film has entirely lost its momentum, and it stumbles to an abrupt ending lacking the poetry Hillcoat was hoping for.

Prior to ""Lawless,"" I had only seen Hardy in a few blockbuster epics (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inception/dp/B0047WJ12K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inception</a>). His performance is a revelation, possessing the presence of mountains. It's a bitter sin we are forced to endure LaBeouf's preening. There's an interesting supporting character, a local handicapped youth named Cricket. Played by relative unknown Dane DeHaan, it's a striking portrait of tragedy. Wouldn't it have been interesting to switch DeHaan and LaBeouf? I'm just not convinced LaBeouf can evolve into the kind of leading man of action ""Lawless"" attempts to force-feed us. And when you have Hardy, Clarke, Chastain and Oldman standing in the background with the film's running time slowly ticking away, you know a great opportunity has been lost.",1366934400,,5275,6.865671641791045

5176736,4,B008OPZD8C,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

So I recently got around to watching Lawless for the first time and I must admit I was pretty impressed. Going in I wasn't really sure what to expect. I don't remember seeing any trailers leading up to its release and I ultimately had no clue what it was about. All I really knew was that Shia LaBeouf was in it. While the film probably won't find its way into my list of favorites, it's hard not to appreciate just how good it actually is.

Based on a true story, what isn't these days, Lawless follows the lives of the three Bondurant brothers during the prohibition era. Forrest (Tom Hardy), Howard (Jason Clarke), and Jack (LaBeouf) run a moonshine business and while these three actors may not look similar in appearance, their chemistry on screen more than makes up for it. Forrest is the oldest, and possibly the wisest, Howard is a hothead, and Jack is pretty much the runt of the group who lacks the fearlessness that his brothers have. The movie lets you know this from the get-go as a younger Jack is unable to pull the trigger on a pig on his dad's farm.

Everything seems to be going ok for the three brothers until Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce) comes along. Charlie is a deputy from Chicago who was sent to crack down on the bootlegging currently going on in Franklin County, Virginia. Even though I hated his character with a passion Pearce did a phenomenal job at bringing this character to life, which seems to be a common theme among the entire cast.

As I watched the film part of me felt that Jack was supposed to be the main character. He was the one you were supposed to care about the most, but I found it hard to do that when Tom Hardy comes through and just dominates his performance as Forrest. I don't remember the last time I've seen an actor get so into his character. Off the top of my head I can only think of two: Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in 50/50. As I watched the film on the couch I truly felt intimidated by Forrest. Here was a man who did not give a single damn. He didn't do what he did because he wanted to, he does it out of necessity. Out of his sheer will to live. Hardy's character doesn't necessarily have a lot of dialogue, but sometimes it's his silence or his facial expressions that say more than any dialogue ever could.

Some minor roles include Maggie (Jessica Chastain), Bertha Minnix (Mia Wasikowska), Cricket (Dane DeHaan), and Floyd Banner (Gary Oldman). Just like the main cast these supporting actors give outstanding performances. Maggie is a former dancer from Chicago who wanted to get away from the city life. She winds up being the waitress at the Bondurant gas station and also, later on, Forrest's love interest. Bertha is a young Amish woman who Jack is obviously attracted to. At first I thought that her role felt forced and insignificant, but it later proves to be more important than I initially thought. Cricket is a friend of Bondurant brothers who helps with their moonshine business. And Floyd Banner is a mobster who later becomes an ally to Jack. As previously stated, each of these actors brought their A-game. However, it would be criminal of me if I didn't give a little bit of recognition to Gary Oldman. The man has maybe a total of 20 lines throughout the entire movie, but, just like Hardy, he put it all on the table. He made himself Floyd Banner and he's just a joy to watch.

As a whole I felt the story was solid. The only part that really annoyed me was that they had a main character (Jack) who is unable to do what needs to be done until the situation gets as bad as it could possibly get. I don't know about anyone else, but to me that whole scenario is extremely overdone in movies like this. It says it's based on a true story, but there was obviously some tweaks made to make it a better cinematic experience. There were a few scenes that felt slightly unnecessary, but all in all everything flowed together really well and was presented by some nearly flawless camera work. The cherry on top? Well that would have to be the fantastic score produced by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis. It has that classic Country-Western vibe without feeling overwhelming and there were a few times during the darker scenes where I felt chills rush down my spine.

Overall Score: 8/10 - Considering I had little to no knowledge about this movie going in I have to admit that the final result was more than satisfying. The story may not be perfect, but it's held together by some good pacing, a strong cast, a great score, and some phenomenal acting. If you're into gangster-esque films and you have two hours to kill I definitely recommend giving this this a shot.",1365724800,,4716,4.489510489510489

It's just OK.,1365292800,,276,3.7241379310344827

5176748,3,B008OPZD8C,It was just a ok movie. Lots of a violence and some unbelievable things happening (don't want to say them as it'll be too much to reveal). A bit disappointing since I rented this going by the reviews.,1365120000,,200,4.2894736842105265

5176750,4,B008OPZD8C,"Very good acting and attention to detail as far as making it authentic to the period, 1920's-30's.  Not a big fan a violence and I wonder if they added some for drama.

5176752,4,B008OPZD8C,"I watched this movie with a group of college friends, and needless to say, if you are squeamish don't watch this movie. There is quite a bit of violence and other aspects that contribute to this movie's MPAA rating. I would not recommend this for families. Also, there are a few inconsistencies within the movie, but I'm afraid that if I share those, I may potentially spoil portions of the plot for those of you who indeed watch it.",1365120000,2,433,4.493670886075949

5176758,5,B008OPZD8C,This was by far the best work Shia L or Tom H have done.  It was gripping at every turn and gave you a sense of wanting the not so good but not so bad guys to win.  The story about the 3 moonshine slicking brothers was excellent.  Lots of action - couple of sad parts - mostly a happy ending -lots of awkward moments.  Only thing is that you kind of wish Shia would have been a little more assertive than being his usual (getting kicked in the pants) and then getting strength toward the end kind of guy in this film (basically he was the weaker of the 3).  Tom Hardy made me smile so many times just because his demeanor in this film was very typical but he played this character so well - you over see it.  Jessica C did a great job too - it's not easy getting nacked in front of such hotties (well maybe) but it was still amazing. Loved it and you will too :),1364947200,,862,3.953757225433526
5176759,5,B008OPZD8C,"This was a unique true story that takes place during prohibition and focuses primarily on the three Bondurant brothers and their bootlegging business. The acting is incredible and the relationships between characters are convincing.  There is a good deal of blood and violence which truly warrants the ""R"" rating. Not a movie for the feint, but an excellent representation of history during that time period as well as loyalty between brothers.",1364860800,,444,5.253521126760563
5176760,5,B008OPZD8C,"Loved the movie, especially since it's based on a true story.  Interesting to see how moonshiners lived and operated their business.  Great acting.",1364601600,,147,5.3478260869565215

5176762,4,B008OPZD8C,You will not think that it will end well but they end up staying together after the terrible things happens to them. The older brother was his own man and stubborn. Keeps you intertained clear to the end. Wouldn't mind owning this one.,1364515200,,235,4.488372093023256
5176763,2,B008OPZD8C,I  was  very interested in the story of the Bondurant brothers because I grew up in southern Virginia and know personally some Bondurants.  The movie was so violent that I could not get past about 20 minutes.  The language is also very offensive.  Too bad I can't learn more about these brothers without all the blood and gore.,1364515200,,327,4.568965517241379

5176769,3,B008OPZD8C,"Since this is a true story, I would have liked a little more background detail on the 3 bootlegging brothers, mob villains, and especially the mixed loyalties of the local lawmen.  What we end up with are somewhat cliched stereotypes of macho southern tough guy posturing and an inhumanly brutal mob.  Neither elicits much sympathy as money seems to be their only motive.  On the plus side, the sets, locations, costumes, and music are superb enough to make it worth watching once.",1364169600,,481,4.841463414634147

5176774,5,B008OPZD8C,"I live in West Virginia on the border with Kentucky and have had work-related reasons to visit Franklin County.  Much of it is still little different from its appearance and portrayal in the first-rate film Lawless.

As presented in Lawless, Franklin County might be characterized as ""Bloody Franklin,"" roughly comparable to Harlan County or ""Bloody Harlan,"" the setting for never-ending, violent conflict between coal miners on their way to early graves from Black Lung and gun thugs aided and abetted by corrupt officials working for Big Coal.  Lawless, however, takes a different, though equally ugly and violent tack, focusing on the production and distribution of bootleg whiskey.

Lawless romanticizes the lives and times of bootleggers in unashamed fashion, presenting them as tough-as-a-nickel-steak  heroes with a good deal of homespun integrity.  By contrast, their most conspicuous adversaries are caricatures of legally sanctioned viciousness and in-your-face arrogance, outsiders whose pomade can't cover their lack of character, something shared only by real men who have done what they have to in making their way in a hostile world.

That said, how does the viewer see Lawless as something with more gravity than backwoods, slack-jawed campiness?  One way is to take Lawless seriously as an allegory for life in the Appalachian U.S.  There, in rural West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky, the contrast between right and wrong, good and bad, decent and decadent are as clear cut, plain to see, and fraught with peril as in a mainland China forced labor camp.  In a lot of places in our world, subtlety, nuance, shades of gray, and understatement are artificial contrivances that misrepresent rather than clarify.  Contrary to aesthetically mandated conventional wisdom, some stories really do have only one side.  If you're afflicted with a really powerful aversion to this accurately simplified view of much of the world, you won't like Lawless any more than you'd like, say, John Sayles' movie Matewan or the Norwegian film The King of Devil's Island.  You'll find it just too easy to make hard and fast moral judgments.

Lawless, however, is not devoid of artful and well-wrought irony.  The good guys are the law breakers, trying to get by in a hard place during the hardest of times.  With or without free booze, the local cops are sympathetic to their mountain-bred brethren and they rein in the worst excesses of their nominal allies sent in from the outside.  The lead character, played by Shia LeBouf, is not the feckless loose cannon that first appearances might lead us to expect him to be.  Jessica Chastain really is looking for peace and quiet, a reprieve from the chaos, grime, and random cruelty of city life.  Tom Hardy's fanciful run in with natural causes proves to be more of a challenge than knives and bullets that draw blood in anger.

LeBouf does a good job of maintaining his unlikely clean-cut boyishness throughout the film, but it would be good to know more about him.  Mia Waiskowska inserts a believable streak of independence and a good deal of cultural contrast into her Amish-like character as Lebouf's love interest, though LeBouf's peaceable dinner with her family may be a bit far-fetched.  Tom Hardy is always likable, though he plays his character so low-key that he could serve as a stand-in for Mumbles, one of Hardy's friends in the black comedy Rock'n'Rolla.  Guy Pearce does a superb job as official Hooveresque evil personified.

Lawless is by no means a perfect film, but it's a lot of fun with excitement and intensity to spare.  I liked it, and I'll watch it again.  Blood flows freely in this violent world, evoking the dark, violent, and, yes, lawless themes that pervade this part of our planet.",1363996800,,3764,5.059967585089141

5176778,5,B008OPZD8C,"I really did enjoy this movie. I wasn't too sure about Shia, but I didn't mind him in this part. It actually suited him. I loved Tom Hardy, of course. Jason Clarke and Jessica Chastain both did well. I wanted to see more of Howard because I like that kind of crazy in a character. And I've read several places that the roles of Jessica and Mia were contrived and a waste and the people who wrote the reviews didn't see the point of those characters. Without spoiling it for others, I thought they were very important to the story. This is based on real people and their lives. It may have been ""Hollywood-ized"" but the basic elements are still there, including why these characters were in the movie. I think these days people think WAY too much into things and can't just enjoy a story. Oh, and Gary Oldman and Guy Pearce are always a treat. Love them. If you haven't seen Tom Hardy in Warrior you should. Like, right now. And Jessica in Jolene. It's not an easy movie to watch due to the nature of it, but that girl has range.",1363824000,,1028,4.304123711340206

5176835,4,B008OPZD8C,"Australian John Hillcoat is without a doubt one of the most fascinating filmmakers working today, an heir to a style of filmmaking that not only seems dead now, but long so. His movies are beauties to behold, they are character driven, action filed and deal with themes of displaced men and time. His new movie, Lawless, is no exception, to say it fails to reach the same heights as his two previous pictures is not a criticism so much as an observation, it's not as powerful as the highly regarded stark western the Proposition nor is it as deeply moving as his underrated adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's the Road. With a recent output like that, it would be tough to continue or equal it, yet Lawless is still a sensational motion picture, not just one of the year's very best, but a strong identifiable work that will be appreciated for a long time to come.
 Working from a screenplay by musician Nick Cave, who also wrote the excellent script for the Proposition, adapted from the fact based book by Matt Bondurant (grandson of one of the film's actual protagonists) the Wettest County in the World, Hillcoat's original movie title. Set in rural America of the prohibition era, Lawless tells what Cave calls ""a true myth"" about the Bondurant brothers, outlaw heroes of the Virginia hill country, moonshiners who not only defy the law, but as legend has it are invincible because of the many perils that they have overcome and survived that would kill lesser men. None more audacious than middle brother, Forrest (Tom Hardy), who is either blessed or actually is  immortal, his survival skill is something to consider.
 When a big city special agent, Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce) comes into Franklin county, not so much to put a stop to the brothers illegal activities, but looking for part of the take. Hostilities between the Bondurants and the law escalates to also include big city gangsters like Floyd Bonner (Gary Oldman). The conflict eventually grows into outright warfare between the lot of them.
 Things aren't all bloodshed and death, as youngest brother Jack (Shia LeBouf), while trying to prove himself as a worthy heir to the family legacy, also finds himself courting a local preacher's daughter, Bertha (Mia Wasikowska). But the real love story develops between Forrest and Maggie Beauoral (Jessica Chastin), a city girl, who comes to Franklin county looking to outrun a past best left forgotten. The two wounded souls with hard exteriors are able to unleash their inner tenderness together.
 Hillcoat has returned macho cinema to a glorious unflinching place from it's celebrated bloodstained past. His best work recalls the films of maverick hard men directors like Sam Peckinpah, Sam Fuller, Raoul Walsh, and other ambitious auteurs often with a reputation for the lurid, perhaps never more so than with Lawless. Combining elements of the urban gangster film and the western outlaw hero stories, pooled before with mixed results in pictures such as Walter Hill's Last Man Standing and the superior Sam Elliott telefilm You Know My Name, here with greater results. Everything at this juncture is a work of masterful film art, great production and attention to period details, sharp camera work (by Benoit Delhomme), taunt editing, a memorable score and first rate performances.
 Impeccably told in a style that gives a real sense of time and place. We gain a real feel for the people and the locations. This is the kind of movie that you can smell in your mind, from the unkempt Bonderants to the more dandy Rakes.
 LeBouf is reasonably good in the role of Jack, playing a timid, semi-weak young man transformed into a cocky, arrogant hothead. LeBouf is an alright actor who sometimes gets undue flack, however, he lacks the real strength to fully carry a film like this, he's a little too blas to be a good leading man. That's why we have Tom Hardy, who with his portrayal of Forrest Bondurant, fully comes into his own as a movie star, this is the one that should transfix him into a household name. Hardy dominates every scene he is in, he walks away with the movie after kicking it in the teeth and leaving it bludgeoned over the head.
 The supporting cast is just as superb, in fact Lawless couldn't be all that it is without the small, but crucial work done by Jessica Chastain, who is not only one of the most exciting presences on film today, but seems to be as impervious to bad film roles as the Bondurants are to bereavement. Guy Pearce, who has appeared in Hillcoat's two previous masterworks, is ferocious and unrelenting as the essentially strong antagonist, it`s remarkably to think of all the many different type of roles we`ve seen Pearce do in the recent past. Mia Wasikowska with her ethereal beauty and infectious smile adds a perfect counter balance to the testosterone fueled antics on screen. Gary Oldman is always a welcome presence, even if it is just a cameo as it is here, but he looks cool and snazzy with a tommy gun.
 The score by Cave and Warren Ellis is something of genius unto it's elf. Cave, providing new music with a special one off band, cheekily called the Bootleggers, as well as incorporating tunes beautiful sung by Emmylou Harris, the soundtrack not only assists the movie, but helps to more fully tell it's story. Cave and his bootleggers give a thrilling rendition of Lou Reed's Velvet Underground classic ""White Light, White Heat"", match by a winning bluegrass interruption by Ralph Stanley played over the picture's closing credits. The supplementary CD release of the soundtrack album is via Sony Classical, proving that even the label recognizes the artistry in the accompanying music.
 Lawless is a rip roaring thrilling adventure. A gun totting, gin soaked action drama. It's all that, with the kick of a mule captured in a bottle of pure grain white lightning and white heat.

5176838,4,B008OPZD8C,"Interesting,good cinematography, great acting and pace. It makes you think of how prohibition affected the whole nation and the violence , corruption and underground economy it promoted.  I like the fact that the movie questions  our stand on what is the law, who is the law and how something that is legal can become illegal the next or vice versa .",1362268800,,350,4.721311475409836

5176840,5,B008OPZD8C,"I was thoroughly surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. After reading and hearing such mixed reviews, I decided to rent it anyway (considering it was a $1 rental special) and was blown away how much of a hidden gem this movie really is. Although it definitely deserves the ""R"" rating, it was well worth the money and more.",1362182400,,324,4.508474576271187
5176841,3,B008OPZD8C,"The movie could have been better. Based off of, or rather inspired by real brothers, the movie lacks a little something extra. A great cast, big Tom Hardy fan although Guy Pierce steals the show. The movie definitely keeps your interest, but at times it seems like the story has been done a few times before. Some more depth in the story could've helped it some.
This movie is for anyone who is into those old time, good ole boy, action packed movies, this is for you.

5176844,4,B008OPZD8C,"Since I read the book before seeing the movie, I was skeptical.  However, this movie, while not perfect, kept my attention and delighted me.  Tom Hardy's character did not not have much to work with in the way of the script, but his character is a man of few words who does more with his actions and mannerisms.  Hardy did a good job with his character, creating a facade of invulnerability and toughness with a soft spot for his family and friends.  Shia LaBeouf, whose previous work I have not been a fan of, was actually rather good as the junior Bondurant who is eager to prove himself, but is callow and unsure of himself.  In my view, Guy Pearce, as the foppish, preening, self-absorbed, inhumane deputy from Chicago stole the film.  You really hated him and when Pearce was on the screen, you noticed little else.  Pearce was in the movie Prometheus, and was, in my view, the weak link in that film from an acting perspective, but in this film he really brought his character to life.

From what I can gather about Prohibition and the history of it, ""The Wettest Country in the World"" is more than a little over the top, and this movie is also over the top.  However, sometimes the Moonshiners did resort to violence and there were lawmen who were corrupt and on the take.  Therefore, this movie is almost certainly a composite of the worst elements of the Prohibition Era, and it is a well-told story that is engaging the interesting.

There is some violence and nudity.  Sensitive and younger viewers should be warned.  However it is not over the top.  All-in-all, a worthy investment for a Friday night.",1362096000,2,1613,4.574912891986063

2. several scenes filmed without accompanying light; had to listen to what was going on instead of viewing during several scenes.  Would be fine if the darkness lended to the movie, however, it seemed it was a cheaper way of filming this movie.

First of all, moonshine business is not this violent.  This movie is very over the top. The acting it horrid. The story is a disgrace. I would have even been mildly entertained at some blood or action, but sadly it lacked even slightly cool fighting scenes. It has been a while since a film was so bad I just turned it off.

5176900,1,B008OPZD8C,"I'm laughing as I write this.  Sooooo Baaaad (*insert mile-long groan here)  I honestly can think of NO reason for my worst enemy to suffer this blight on cinema.  Gary Oldman is cool and all but he's in it so briefly that he becomes another symptom the empty promise that is LAWLESS.  It's movie seriously ridiculous.  Friends have called me from all corners of this great nation to confirm this theory.  Eeee gads!  LAWLESS is a horror show of stinky acting, painful premise and nausiating filmmaking - if you can call it that.  In fact, lets start with with the direction of this travesty.
The director - I have no interest in learning his name after LAWLESS - must have really thought of himself as a serious filmmaker because of the ""symbolic"" shots of roosters in the yard after the jacked-up macho brothers fight, or the shot of the horses running in the fields when the two lovers drive off on their date together...NEED I SAY MORE?

Now lets talk acting.

(I say what I say with love - because there are a lot of brilliant actors in this movie. They were just given a lame script and a fourteen year old director who apparently thought his mind was expanding.  I pity that situation - however endorsed by Hollywood it may be.  The victims are the actors every time.)
Yet Tom Hardy might be a little culpable.
Tom Hardy... What movie were you in?? You were off on your own planet!  Did you read in the script that your character was the hard-as-nails older brother and thought that you'd been given permission to be as superior and distant as you wanted? Seriously, man. Your grumbling voice was so much more believable when you had a mask covering your face in Batman.  There was no connection to your fellow actors which may have been an ""artistic choice"" but you need to at least know what the other actors are doing so you can look like you belong in the same movie!!  Eee gads!

I don't even have the heart to continue with this review. For one reason, I saw it last spring and I've tried to shut it out completely.  Suffice to say it was hands down THE WORST FILM I HAVE SEEN IN THE THEATER IN A LONG TIME.  As for the plot: If you want to see a bunch of ignorant hillbilly bootleggers pretending to be gangsters but whose story goes NOWHERE by all means, fire away.  I would suggest assuming this movie is as bad as I say and spending your hard-earned money on something that isn't the artistic equivalent of an erupted cyst.",1360281600,,2440,4.430493273542601

Yeah, I know moonshine is big again these days for some unknown reason, but this attempt to cash in on the craze really falls flat.

5176926,5,B008OPZD8C,"There are a lot of reviews here for this movie, so there is not much more that I can add, that has not already been said.

But I really enjoyed this movie, so I have to at least throw in my 2 cents or more :-)

(Side Note:
The movie is based on a real family of  moon-shining  brothers, and a real incident that ends up in the papers. I believe there is a book out right now, about the real brothers behind the movie LAWLESS, written by the grandson of one of the brothers shown in this movie. I don't want to give away which brother that is.)

I love period film pieces. And the era of the 20's and 30's has always appealed to me as well. So right off the bat, I knew from seeing the trailer, I was bound to rent this  movie sooner or later.

 Funny how the period piece films bring a nostalgia to them, that you actually feel, even if you were not even born at the time the movie/story is taking place.

This was well done as far as giving the viewer the feel for what the Prohibition Days were like down south and how MOONSHINE production was taken very seriously- not just for personal consumption, but for re-sale to others.

Whether it was made and sold to locals or a bigger concern- like gangsters, who would often then re-sell it as well;for the time booze was illegal, moonshine was a big money maker for those creating it.

In reality, and upon looking back at the proliferation of booze that still flowed across America despite the ban - Prohibition not only did not stop the use of alcohol- it drove up the demand.

That was the lesson learned about trying to ban alcohol.

You have to wonder, for the amount of years booze was illegal, how many people were getting rich off the illegality- as well as how many people got sick or died off bad moonshine.

(Going blind or dropping dead were the risk you took, if you bought moonshine  made by someone who didn't know what they were doing.)

But as always, when there is a demand for something- especially something hard to get and illicit- there is big money to be had.

The three tightly knit brothers in LAWLESS jumped on this money making bandwagon early in the game, although the two older brothers try to keep the youngest( Shia Lebouf) from being *too* involved in the business, which he greatly resents.

They definitely love him- and there is a deep thread of loyalty that hold all three together, but the two older brothers don't seem to think their little brother has what it takes to play by the rules in this game.

They make it clear this is not a game one can screw up in.

Mistakes get people shot and often killed. Mistakes can piss off people and stir up trouble.

So, while the money they earn is shared amongst all of them,( they also run a restaurant as well) Shia Lebouf's youth and immaturity cause the brothers to shut him out of things; for his own sake and for the sake of their thriving business.

In the very rural area  where the brothers reside, it is unspoken code that law enforcement looks the other way for local moonshiners - out of courtesy or for a little kickback.

Nobody hassles anyone really. It is a peaceful, predictable life and the townsfolk all seem to get along.

That is,until Guy Pearce's character comes to town.

Pearce has slime ball written all over him.

 A sadistic, city slicker, quirky in a sick & twisted way, he announces himself a federal arm of the law who will hunt down every moonshiner until there are none left.

He has heard about the moonshine business being very lucrative in this area, but more importantly he has heard about the three brothers, in particularly the one brother who is deemed *immortal*( played by a scruffily handsome Tom Hardy).

 This is the local lore and it more or less develops that Hardy is immortal because of the many trials and tribulations he has endured in his young life, particularly when it comes to fighting, particularly with guns.

Guy Pearce is both intrigued and amused by the lore of this brother who can't be killed.

 It should be noted that it is Tom Hardy's character who basically plays the head of the family to the other 2 brothers.  ( Their parents died earlier but that is not depicted in the film.)

He is looked up to by his brothers with great awe, respect and admiration.

 Also,it is always his word that is final in any matters regarding the family- particularly the business end of things.

Guy Pearce  finally gets the chance to meet Hardy and the exchange is an unpleasant one.

One which Hardy makes it clear, that Pearce's presence and  position of law enforcement, don't mean squat to him.

Verbally, he gives Pearce the proverbial slap in the face, and in front of others, no less.

Pearce walks away thinking it is time to take Tom Hardy and his almighty reputation down a notch.

Developing an instant hatred for the man, Pearce is all too eager to be the man to see  the *immortal one* go down in flames.

He becomes hellbent on destroying  not just  Tom Hardy 's character, but also, his moon-shining brothers and their business.

 Kudos for Guy Pearce, for playing one of the creepiest, skin crawling characters to ever show up in story line,with such subtly.

Accolades for Tom Hardy, playing the strong silent type, that tends to delivers cryptic words of wisdom.

The guy who has been to hell and back and is still standing.

This is a character, who never actually looks for a fight, but also never backs down from one.

He always comports himself with confidence, not arrogance.

Sometimes  he has a  certain look or gives off an affect at times, that says that under all that tough veneer, that ability to always seem steel strong, that there might be a layer of emotional vulnerability buried deep inside, underneath it all.

Jessica Chastain is there as a  meaningful character but how meaningful is not realized right away.

While her part is important, she doesn't get to do all that much talking.

Regardless, it becomes obvious she is an integral part of the storyline as it moves along.

Gary Oldman is a personification, a collage if you will,of any and all gangsters of that era, whose names were on the headlines of newspapers, or heard about on the radio, back in the day.

His film time is brief- too brief really. (Especially if you are an Oldman fan.)

Though his screen time is short, it is Oldman's  character's unusual meeting and  interaction with Shia Lebouf , that leaves an impact on Lebouf's character and gives him the guts and incentive to show his brothers he is definitely ready to join their ranks.

He feels he can finally prove to them, he has what it it takes to finally work hands on, in the business, especially doing physical transactions of transporting moon-shine.

Is this film violent?  Yes, it is, and the violence is up close and gritty, but it is not gratuitous violence in my opinion.

It is there to show how ruthless things start to get, in this once sleepy little town, once Guy Pearce sticks his nose into things.

 And trust me- moonshine might be illegal but you will hate Guy Pearce so much, it will just give you all the more reason to root for not just the 3 brothers, but anybody trying to get by, selling their home made moonshine.

The whole movie takes on a new tone and a different pace, once Guy Pearce's character comes to town to make trouble, and a name for himself.

 If you can handle violence and want to see how life in the South was during the prohibition( as opposed to often seeing it  depicted in the big cities)this is a fast paced movie, with a definite amount of suspense, where all the key characters play their parts well and an ending that should satisfy all.

I know that after  seeing this movie, I later went online to look up more about this trio, as well as reviewing articles on the Prohibition era in general.

It might certainly look a lot more glamorous and macho in the movies  of Hollywood,as depicted in the past and present, but there is no doubt that the Prohibition days were colorful, interesting and, often daringly dangerous times indeed.",1359849600,,8030,4.494125777470629

The movie didn't flinch from the hardscrabble life of the folks living their back then or the violence and corruption.

Highly recommended with exactly acting performances all round. It even has the lovely Jessica Chastain before she rose to super stardom in Zero Dark Thirty. Mia Wasikowska portrayal of Bertha Minnix is also worthy of note.",1359504000,,567,5.031914893617022
5176944,5,B008OPZD8C,I really love this movie. I really like Tom Hardy as Forrest and Jason Clark as Howard. It is unbeliveable that the story line actually did happen. How Forrest had his throat cut and he actually lived. Really enjoyed this movie.,1359504000,,228,4.585365853658536

I have taken a bus tour of the town in which many of the locations of the events shown in the movie were pointed out and I have seen other places where events occurred that were mentioned in the movie. I have met some of the descendants of the characters in the movie, also. My late uncle made moonshine.

5176946,5,B008OPZD8C,"Lawless is an excellent movie and I do not make this statement lightly.  All the characters are with flaws however, some are redeemable many are not.  This movie is an explanation of how banning one product in this case alcohol thus creates an opposing and lawless response.  Note to governments, banning a substance simply creates a criminal underground to produce the same product that is banned and with deadly costs.",1359504000,,420,4.9714285714285715
5176947,3,B008OPZD8C,Tom Hardy is badass in this turn as Forrest Bondurant.  Otherwise a fairly predictable prohibition story. Shia Lebeuf is ho hum.  Guy Pearce is punching the clock.,1359417600,,163,5.0

This film never got off the ground, whoever edited it did a horrible job it did not peice together at all i really wanted to like it, but it really sucked. Everybody is different but this film poorly done the acting was mediocre, the story never got going once you thought it was it went a different direction, for 4.00 watch one of the old B films on Dillinger with Warren Oates pretty cheesy but much better than this terrible film.

5176977,5,B008OPZD8C,Lawless in my opinion started out a bit slow but soon became interesting and seeing how lawless it really was back in those days. Moonshine was a big thing back then.,1359072000,,166,4.387096774193548
5176978,5,B008OPZD8C,"Great flick. The acting is well done and the period looks accurately depicted. The story sucked me in, the characters kept me interested, and the outcome left me satisfied.

5176992,4,B008OPZD8C,"If you would let Tarantino do an episode of Boardwalk Empire, the result might look approximately like this. Thrilling, violent, sometimes surprising, sometimes actually beautiful, and with great acting.
I liked it a lot. It suffers a little from the claim to 'reality' and the narrative concept of letting one of the brothers Bondurant tell the story from the off. It could have been much more compact and on a higher suspense level if it had been a straight story script.
A prohibition story. Three brothers run a successful still in the woods. The law is both with them, via corrupt cops, and against them, via other corrupt cops. The brothers are cultivating a legend of immortality. They seem to believe their own legend themselves.
Tom Hardy in a role like specially written for him. The grouchy super macho, the one who takes no prisoners and accepts no compromises. The one who ogles the girl and hesitates. As Jessica Chastain's character says: you let a girl wait an awfully long time. Chastain is a true miracle to me. 2 years ago I had never heard of her and now she is the queen of the screen. She is really very good.
Best supporting actor: Gary Oldman as a gangster called Floyd Banner. If that man didn't exist, he should be invented. Oldman, I mean.",1358812800,,1266,4.65625
5176993,4,B008OPZD8C,"The acting was good the casting was well done and I liked it. Be aware it many violent scenes, and is supposedly based on real events. I'm always surprised when the subject o making moonshine comes up in casual conversation how many folks don't know that the super-popular NASCAR races are a direct descendant of the practice by some country folks ""souping-up"" car engines and drive-lines as well as lightening certain other areas of regular cars and light trucks plus substantially strengthening others to meet the design goal of outrunning the law when the ""shiners"" made their usually night time deliveries. I lived five years in Atlanta. GA in the early/mid 1950s and they called the races ""stock car"" races back then. I enjoyed the movie.",1358812800,,743,4.904761904761905

I really felt like I could connect with the characters, and it was good seeing actors play a different role that they usually aren't in. Tom Hardy and Shia Lebouf(sp?) did fantastic in my opinion. I finished this wanting more of the story, and was sad when it ended. Its strange because not alot happens in the movie, yet it seems to work, possibly because its a true story.

5177078,5,B008OPZD8C,"Living in Southwest Virginia it's nice to see movies about our heritage coming out in theaters nowadays. I've read terrible reviews about the movie, but after watching I cannot see why. Hardy does a wonderful job portraying Forrest Bondurant and even though he doesn't talk a lot throughout the movie you'll grow to love his character quite quickly. Shia Labeouf really sheds his real world image and surprised me in this movie. You see his character grow right before your eyes and I was quite surprised by his performance. My only problem with the characters is the directors decision to only briefly have Gary Oldman make appearances. However, for his limited screen time he does a great job as the likable villain. Many people have said Guy Pearce did a wonderful job in this movie and if I liked him as an actor perhaps I'd agree, unfortunately I am not a fan.

-Excellent character development in the movie that covers the entire cast.
-Near nonstop action with a story that really keeps you interested.
-Some surprising gory moments that will make any man cringe.
-Short full frontal nude scene(just a warning for the parents).

Even if it's just a rental, everyone should check this movie out.",1357776000,3,1201,4.825242718446602

Pierce's character seems to be trying too hard to make you hate him, not because of his performance, but that fact that his hatred of the moonshiners is never fully understood, therefore falling short in justification.
Great ending, Tom Hardy takes the film to the level of greatness it achieves. Some people give Shia Labeouf crap, but I just don't see why. He is a good actor and doesn't disappoint in this film.

If you are looking for something to wet your appetite for a thriller that takes a slew of big names and throws them together in an epic that was a masterpiece, this is your movie.
-The acting was superb.
-The directing was spot on (especially for a relatively unknown director).
-The look of the movie was gritting and yet riviting at the same time.
-The replay ability is high without question on it.

Here's a tiny snipit from my RottenTomatoes review:
...Lawless played out before my eyes like a siren luring her prey to their watery deathsonly in this case it would be under the moonshine...

The story was very interesting and actually held my attention for whet the theme was. The characters are what I think made it, just a great cast for sure. There was this storytelling aspect of it that just made you relate with the characters and enough conflict to make ones head spin, it wasn't all blood and guts drama to, although there's plenty of that. There's little love stories that are sweet and some comedy, which makes it fun.  Very well done.",1357689600,,547,4.47

white lightening.

I just wish the director/producer hadn't thought the need for excessive blood and aggression was necessary to get the story across.  I have no doubt it was historically accurate in that regard, it was a rough and tough time in America, I just didn't need to see it on the screen.  I, personally, am not yet desensitized (and probably never will be) to that sort of theater and would have enjoyed the movie a little more if I hadn't been on guard to shield my eyes with a couch pillow whenever I thought an excessively bloody and hostile scene was about to play out.

But otherwise awesome!",1357516800,,328,4.47457627118644

It avoids the pitfall of the predictable just enough to keep you wondering and waiting for what happens next. The characters, while not idealized, are surprisingly likeable in their unique ways. The plot is fast-moving and engaging from start to finish. This is the first I've seen actor Tom Hardy in an American movie. I became a fan of his work in British film, and was impressed in this case, by his ability to do perfect-pitch backwoods southern speak.

When this movie started I thought it dragged a bit, but as the story grows it gets intense.  Boy what people went thru to get a drink.  This movie is as much about depression times as well as all the surviving families went thru.
Tom Hardy is a Great Older Brother trying to take care of business and Shia LeBur is excellent as the baby brother.
Great movie and I recommend it.",1357344000,,474,4.314606741573034

5177131,4,B008OPZD8C,"Moonshine heroes ;). The character development was great and the actors were very emotive which is difficult considering the setting and subject matter. It kind of moved me like The Quiet Man. A full slice of Great Depression era history with those character reversal story arcs I always enjoy: the 'good guy' is bad and the 'bad guys' are good, an experienced and abused woman finds protection, love and renewed purity, the passive and inexperienced excel, the brave elevate to myth, the impartial accomplices come into the light, the innocent savant suffers as sacrifice and justice works in unexpected ways.

Timely to see this story today - once again, we learn 'prohibition never works.'",1357257600,,692,5.0701754385964914

There was a lot that went on in that region during the 20's and 30's that we probably would not believe today.",1357257600,,260,4.16

5177136,1,B008OPZD8C,"I kept waiting to care about one of these characters, or see them grow, but this movie just kind of 'happened'.  This movie had a great cast which was totally wasted on an unbelievably bad script that took the movie nowhere.  The level of violence is very sudden and ridiculous.  I can tolerate a violent movie if there is a good payout (think inglorious basterds) but this one contained all the disgusing violence without any reward for viewing it.  Guy Pierce (great actor) played the bad guy who was written more like a psychotic comic-book villain than anything believable.  He was clearly trying to channel Christopher Waltz as Captain Landa? from Inglorious Basterds, but it just came off silly in this movie.  Also, Gary Oldman shows up for all of 2 brief scenes, but in the trailer it is implied he plays a big role.  He doesn't.  Wouldn't recommend.",1357257600,,858,4.7114093959731544

I can't wait to get this on DVD. It will be one of the few movies that I watch more than once. It may not be a movie for everyone. If you're more into the fufu movies or mind candy this is not the movie for you. It's a very intense, intellectual movie, that needs someone to understand subtlety and a bit of history.",1356652800,,478,4.150537634408602

5177201,4,B008OPZD8C,Could have been better.  I found you really need to turn up your tv to understand what they are saying due to the southern accents the actors all carry.  I gave it an extra star because it is based on a true story so it made it a little more interesting.,1356652800,,254,3.9607843137254903

5177209,2,B008OPZD8C,"Exciting trailers, beautiful movie posters, high profile actors, authentic set design, gorgeous cinematography, but lack cohesive storyline.  Just a great big tease & false promises

Boring continuous series of 'tit for tat' revenge between the bootleggers & local people who refused to follow to join their dirty deeds.

Very cliche like what a newly graduated film student would make  Numerous bursts of 'excitment' & gunfights but meaningless & become mundane. Why?  Because it lacks logic.  Lack attention to details in the story development, lack the smarts & intellectual ways of telling a mundane event.

The theme should broaden itself not just 2 guys don't like each other.  What's in it for them?  Ken Burns' documentary on the Prohibition was even more authentic, suspenseful than this movie.

If it weren't for Shea LaBoef & other strong actors this movie would have gone straight to VHS.  A true B movie.  I watched for 1 hour & had no idea where this is going.  Too bad I already bought the BR.",1356566400,,1008,4.928571428571429

Beyond representing the point of view of a working-class kid trying to make a living as a bootlegger, nothing fresh or provocative about the Prohibition Period was explored here. And most of the characters were very one-dimensional (good, bad, naive, etc.).",1356566400,2,344,4.948275862068965

5177221,4,B008OPZD8C,"Lawless is by far still a great action flick based on a true story.  Most of the actors do a great job with the characters they are acting as, I agree totally that Gary Oldman didn't get much screen time but still worth the screen time and memorable.  I personally enjoy these style of movies and when I heard that it was going to be out in time for Christmas I put it on my Christmas list.  It still has good fight scenes, some very nice gun shoot out scenes and the brother's standing up to the law and what they believe in the principle of the matter never lay down for anyone, stand your ground.  Some people say no subtitles when watching the movie as a fair warning of people buying this DVD, but if you still enjoy your action movies, good fight scenes, and shoots out, plus it being based on a true story then pick this movie up and enjoy an evening with the movie something to drink and maybe some popcorn.",1356480000,,915,4.211428571428572

5177227,4,B008OPZD8C,The cinematography is amazing in this film.  Tom Hardy did an excellent and believable portrayal of Forrest.  I liked it so much that I got the book from the library and read it.  It is a part of history that involves bootlegging and prohibition that this film is not afraid to show the violence of the law.,1356480000,,307,4.350877192982456

5177234,3,B008OPZD8C,The movie is OK but I hate when movie dialog is quieter than shooting and music. The story line is OK and the acting is average. It is worth renting and watching but I'm glad I did not purchase this film,1356480000,,203,3.975609756097561

Instead, I was very much surprised by the clever acting of Shia Labeouf, Guy Pearce, and Gary Oldman. The studio got it right by underselling the audience with their dull theatrical previews, which leave out the qualities of 'Lawless' that grant it a Tarantinoesque appeal. There are key parts within this movie that make the viewer recoil in disgust, something that is very difficult to pull off outside of slasher movies. Tom Hardy's portrayal of Forrest Bondurant is a bit uneven, as he overacts his role in a puerile sort of way. On the contrary, Guy Pearce's squealy filthiness as Charlie Rakes gives us one of the greatest screen villains since the 'Scorpio Killer' in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dirty-Harry-Blu-ray/dp/B00166MB6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dirty Harry [Blu-ray</a>].

After reading other reviews I was prepared for blood and gore, but it was nothing like that. While some violence, it fit with the theme and story line. It was exciting and entertaining. I usually can't sit for a whole movie - I get bored. This held my attention and was fun to watch. I couldn't quite give it a 5 star rating - it was a little predictable and Clint Eastwood wasn't in it. =)

Later I was raving about it to my buddy and when he came over, I rented it again. I really wish I would've just purchased it instead of spending $10 renting it twice (still cheaper I know). I definitely recommend this movie if you're into Moonshining, western-ish type movies or if you just like the actors. I even liked the bad guy.",1356048000,,480,4.285714285714286

Not sure what he was trying to accomplish but he barely said a word during the entire movie and when he did, he mumbled. Shia Lebouf didn't do much better either and didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the characters. As for Jessica Chastein, she stuck out like a sore thumb.",1355875200,,370,4.455882352941177

I liked the history and feel of this period drama, but some of the scenes are a bit stilted and drawn out to the point of awkwardness. Overall, I enjoyed it though, and the only complaint I have is that it was a little difficult to understand the dialogue in a few instances. It could be the Aussie accents combined with the actor's mumbling portrayal of the character.  And, due to it being a download, I didn't have CC to help me out?!! (Wish the FCC would make CC mandatory with all downloads just like Network programming - available with each and every movie we rent or purchase)!

tried to do business back in the day. The characters in the story were hardcore for sure.
Could have done without the heart felt, boy girl crap. Wasted to much time that could
have been used for more shoot outs and ass whippings. The character that Shia Labeouf
played should have been dropped from the whole movie. No entertaining reason for the
character at all. Real cry baby. I got real tired of the back and forth between him and his girl friend.
The two older brothers were what needed to have more time in the movie.  If the movie had
had more grit from the two older brothers and less whining from Labeouf's character I would have given
it a much higher score.",1355184000,,758,4.338028169014085

Shia and his brothers are moonshiners in the prohibition era. There's a little bit of gun fighting, a little bit of romance, some gangsters and a fair amount of violence.

5177354,4,B008OPZD8C,"Lawless is a gritty, bloody, and powerful gangster tale that takes place in Prohibition-era Virginia. Shia LaBeouf gives his best performance, perhaps of his career, as Jack, the youngest of the Bondurant brothers, who took part in the American dream as back-woods moonshiners. You'll find traces of LaBeouf's typical charm here, but he brings an intensity to the screen I haven't seen from him before. Another fantastic performance is given my Tom Hardy, who plays Jack's older and burlier brother Forrest, who will go to any lengths to uphold his principles. Guy Pearce plays Charley Rakes, the menacing deputy that is trying to put a stop to the Bondurant brother's business, and a character you will instantly hate.

The cinematography in the movie is absolutely gorgeous. John Hillcoat does a terrific job using the Virginian landscape to his advantage, as well as using lighting and colors to their full advantage. I found myself in awe of some of the scenes.

An issue I had with the film is that there were a couple of storylines that could have been developed further, particularly Gary Oldman's and Jessica Chastain's. They both give good performances but I would have liked to see some more screen time from both of them.

Other than that, the movie flows fairly well and comes to a satisfying close. Be warned, there are some gruesome parts that may make your stomach turn. Hillcoat is no stranger to dark and brutal violence, and he doesn't stray away from that with Lawless.",1355097600,,1488,4.896825396825397

5177364,3,B008OPZD8C,"Prohibition sounds like a really engaging basis for a story and I was really take with the trailer.

However Lawless doesn't really deliver on its potential. Tom Hardy's character lacks any depth and he just walks around look king tough and hardly says  word. LaBeouf ends up playing the obligatory  ""Hollywood"" role of the young hero who goes for the love against the odds and is living the dream of bettering himself and he then proceeds to irritatingly overact the rather lack luster events. The talents of Oldman are wasted on a bit part that serves no purpose whilst likewise Pearce's abilties are never exploited with  him portraying perhaps the most interesting character who is completely underdeveloped .
Overall the story as a few good moments that don't really go anywhere and the true story of the bootleggers of prohibition is painted as a weak backdrop and overshadowed by the contrived love story of the younger brother and the somewhat weak story of Hardy's character.

I love movies when someone is cocky and thinks they are going to come some where and make things right and they are put in their place.  That happens in this movie.  I can not tell any more because it would give away part of the movie.

5177381,2,B008OPZD8C,"Nick Cave the song writer wrote the script of this film based on a book written by a descendant of the 3 ""lawless"" moonshiner brothers in West Virginia during the '20s.  The film centers on the middle brother played by Tom Hardy and the younger sibling
played by Shia LaBeouf.  Other cast of characters includes a flashy government agent played by Guy Pearce and a notorious gangster played by Gary Oldman who mysteriously disappeared halfway through the film.  There are also 2 strings of love interests from a woman with a shady past from Chicago and a local preacher's daughter.  Both didn't add much to the story.
Tom Hardy lowered his head and brood.  Only Shia LaBeouf made the attempt to inject some life into this listless film.
The problems with this film are the weak storyline and shallow characterization which undermine the drama and the effectiveness of the intermittent actions and violence.  The mayhem also way stretches viewer's believability.  A man had his throat cut and laid in a pool of blood but survived after walking 20 miles to the hospital. The same person later got hit multi-bullets including a blow hole in the back of this jacket the size of small cannon ball.  Another was shot in the liver and they all survived.

5177391,4,B008OPZD8C,"Dark, dank, ugly and cruel is the setting is Franklin County, Virginia where this apparently true story takes place. The cast is what attracts people to attend this movie, but as far as a story is concerned it is all harsh and bloody and poorly developed despite how hard the actors try with the script they've been given (Nick Cave adapted Matt Bondurant's novel `The Wettest County in the World').

The infamous Bondurant brothers - Forrest (Tom Hardy), Howard (Jason Clarke) and Jack (Shia LaBeouf) - assisted by a rickets crippled boy named Crickett (Dane DeHaan) run a successful bootlegging operation during the depression, up in the mountains of Franklin County, Virginia. The only new person to be admitted into the Bondurant clan is Maggie Beauford (Jessica Chastain) who has escaped Chicago nightclub life for the `peace' of the countryside. Also from Chicago comes crooked Special Deputy Charles Rakes (Guy Pearce) who is after a share of the brothers' profits. Compounding their troubles, the local competition is elbowing in on their activities. Forrest's boisterous defiance and Cricket's knack for moonshine production help the brothers gain a local monopoly. When Forrest is wounded as tension with Rakes escalates, Jack, initially the timid one, must prove his worth against local gangster Floyd Banner's (Gary Oldman) mob, and we see him metamorphose into a cocky exhibitionist in his attempts to woo the off-limits preacher's daughter, Bertha (Mia Wasikowski).

The actors make these people memorable, especially Tom Hardy who simply mumbles his way through life unafraid of death or any outside foes. The rest of the cast is strong given the weak script and the overall atmosphere of the Depression era bootlegging business is brought sharply into focus by director John Hillcoat with the aid of a fine musical score by Nick Cave. The story is bleak and cruel and there is a lot of extreme violence. But is does create a mood.  Grady Harp, December 12",1354752000,,1971,5.095975232198143

I was riveted by Tom Hardy's acting, his portrayal was an original. It did not rely on a particular accent, clothing, make-up, mental defect or resemblance to a historical figure. He created an intelligent backwoods bootlegger, who despite his profession and its violence, lived by a code so strong that he appeared invincible.

It exceeded my already high expectations!

Beautifully shot, masterfully crafted, great pacing with no flat spots and a story that ropes you in and won't let go.  The characters are as intoxicating as the moonshine they're selling.  Run, don't walk, to see anything with the rising star, Tom Hardy, who in my book is the heir to the legendary Marlon Brando.  He and the brilliant Guy Pearce deliver two stellar, shape-shifting performances that embody what great acting is all about.  One of the strengths of Director Hillcoat is his gift for getting solid, moving performances out of ALL his actors.  No weak links in THIS chain.

5177458,4,B008OPZD8C,"It's been years since the theme of bootleggers was the subject matter in movies. Back in the 70s there was a rush of movies about this subject ranging from the low budget MOONRUNNERS (the movie later turned into the hit TV series THE DUKES OF HAZARD) to the even lower budgeted MOONSHINERS. Even Burt Reynolds took on the subject in WHITE LIGHTNING. But then it kind of disappeared. That all changed when reality TV took a shine (pun intended) to the topic and the film LAWLESS is a result of that renewed interest.

Based loosely on the real life story of the three Bondurant brothers in Franklin County, Virginia, the story focuses on a short period of their lives when bootlegging was their claim to fame and the end result was what was called a war in their home county. Descendants of the real life family have written a book on the subject and that is what the film is based on.

The Bondurant brothers were legends in Franklin County. Oldest brother Forrest (Tom Hardy) was said to be indestructible having crossed paths with death on several occasions. Middle brother Howard (Jason Clarke) has perhaps decided to dip into the family recipe too often but remains the muscle of the group. The youngest brother, Jack (Shia LeBouf) is the upstart, trying to think of ways to impress his older brother Forrest and increase the profits of their bootlegging venture. But Forrest is content to sit back and make the money that he does from their product and pay his bribe money to the local sheriff.

All that changes when a new prosecutor comes to town. Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce) is part of a task force that was sent to shut down the stills but who in truth is more interested in taking over the entire county's bootlegging business. When Forrest refuses to comply, Rakes sets out to destroy the Bondurant family in any way possible. The result is a violent and bloody confrontation that leaves Forrest wounded but alive and his brothers ready for revenge. But that is not to happen yet.

Jack decides the best way to increase their finances is to begin selling their product to Chicago gangster Floyd Banner (Gary Oldman). With the country dry due to prohibition, Jack can get good money from the mobster in return for supplying the demand the gangsters need for their town. While the brothers may disagree on this item the money does come in handy at the right time.

Rakes' men having been behind the attack on Forrest and the brutalization of a waitress and love interest of Forrest (Jessica Chastain) that same night have left a bad taste in the mouths of the brothers. When they blow up their still and murder Jack's best friend in cold blood, a harmless young boy who had no chance of being a problem to Rakes, the brothers can take no more. An eventual showdown between the corrupt lawman and the bootleggers is inevitable. It's bloody but not overly so and the results are surprising.

LAWLESS does a great job of capturing the era and area that the film takes place in. The back hills of Virginia look beautiful rather than wasted away and yet the people who live there looks as poor as the times the story takes place in. While bootlegging may have paid the bills for poor farmers who made more money this way it was not the glamorous life that say cocaine dealers have been depicted in more modern stories. These were tough men who did what they had to to feed their families and keep their farms. The work was hard and the rewards merely enough to get by. There was no glitz and glamour here.

The acting here is stupendous. Tom Hardy turns in another dynamite performance as a man who uses few words and fewer actions yet carries the threat of violence about him like an aura. His character knows the ways of the world and tries to convey them with little success to his younger brother. LeBouf does a great job as well, depicting a hero worshipping brother who wants to do well by his family yet gets turned down more often than not. Pearce is equal to these two in depicting a bad guy that even law abiding citizens will find themselves hoping gets his due.

The movie doesn't offer a pretty picture of the bootlegging business but it does offer a few new anti-heroes for viewers to root for. You care about this family and the others who faced these problems in the past. It was a violent world that handled things much differently than they are handled today.

5177465,5,B008OPZD8C,"The Bondurant brothers do what they do best: make damn fine moonshine.  They practically own Franklin County, the residents of whom respect--and fear--Forrest Bondurant, the brothers' ringleader.  But a new lawman, Special Deputy Charlie Rakes, is determined to take his piece of the pie.  But, as Forrest succinctly puts it, the Bondurants ""don't lay down for nobody.""

The film hinges around youngest brother Jack, played here with surprisingly poise by Shia Lebeouf.  It's basically his story, though, as with Matt Bondurant's source novel THE WETTEST COUNTY IN THE WORLD, the most intriguing character is Forrest.  As portrayed by Tom Hardy, Forrest is a hulking beast of few words, a man tied by honor and loyalty, caught up in his own legend, mostly because it largely happens to be true.  Hardy brings much of the same physicality to Forrest as he did to Bane in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, creating yet another memorable performance in a career full of them.  As the third brother, Howard, Jason Clarke doesn't have much to do, but does it extremely well; one wishes his role were larger.  As the villain Rakes (a composite of characters from the novel), Guy Pearce is electric; he walks and talks like a big city dandy, but he strikes with the suddenness and venom of a cobra.  Mia Wasikowski doesn't have much to do in her role of a preacher's daughter; as in the novel, her burgeoning relationship with Jack takes a backseat to everything else.  More interesting is the relationship between Forrest and Maggie, portrayed with an air of regality and seduction by Jessica Chastain.  Perhaps most enjoyable of all, if only for its brevity, is Gary Oldman's performance as a gangster whom Jack admires: in his two scenes, Oldman reminds us why he's one of the great villain actors of his generation (in fact, he does this with a single wink).

The script comes from frequent John Hillicoat collaborator Nick Cave, who again (along with Warren Ellis) provides an exquisitely haunting score.  The trio of Hillicoat, Cave, and Ellis gave us the superb THE PROPOSITION (Pearce's contributions cannot be ignored, either); if LAWLESS doesn't quite equal THE PROPOSITION's level of violence, it's not for lack of trying.  This is a violent film.  The violence isn't constant, but it's realistic and powerful, as it should be in this sort of film.  The story is, of course, somewhat true; if Bondurant's book is a fictionalization of his family's history, then Hillicoat's film is a fictionalization of the book.  Cave's script, Hillicoat's direction, and the actors' performances hold fast to this element of truth: this film, at its core, isn't about moonshine, but humanity.  And sometimes, humanity can be an ugly, violent thing.",1354060800,,2727,4.993362831858407
5177466,4,B008OPZD8C,"I wasn't sure what I was to expect when I first rented this movie. It has one of my favorite childhood actors in it, Shia Labeouf. I been following him since he was in Holes(which came out when I was in the 8th grade). He has been in a lot of excellent movies since then such as Eagle Eye, Transformers 1-3, Disturbia and now Lawless. Based on true events about to brothers who go on a crime spree. Amazing movie about revenge and brotherhood. Gotta give this movie a 4 out 5 (which I rarely give movies 4 stars). The acting was so good with the additions of Tom Hardy and Guy Pierce.
I really overall enjoyed this movie, though it does have a language problem from time to time but its nothing serious.",1354060800,,703,4.253731343283582

5177468,3,B008OPZD8C,"Lawless is an early 1930's period piece about the bootlegging business between three hick brothers who try to maintain their moonshine business with cops and competition crawling up their asses. This movie is very pretty to look at, the music is well done and interesting (covering newer songs to sound older), and the actors sell their roles pretty well. The problem I had with Lawless though was the overall story, tone, characters, and pacing; and here's why:

-Characters: So our protagonist in this film is the youngest of the brothers who's grown up a coward who wants to be a tough guy businessman like his brothers, however he doesn't really find his balls until 20 minutes before the movie's over and makes dumb decisions throughout the film that jeopardizes his family. So we have a flawed protagonist, not really a big deal, it sort of adds depth to him, although all the depth that's given to him makes his character your standard cookie-cutter underdog ripped from countless Hollywood stories and not much else. The middle brother is basically just the family wildcard, and the oldest brother is the quiet reserved badass that pretty much runs the family business himself.

So this is your trio of characters the movie is 'based on', there's almost no depth to any of them if you've seen Hollywood underdog gangster movies before. Then you have sub-characters, such as Rickety Cricket who was a former priest turned cokehea-wait, wrong Rickety Cricket. Crickety Ricket, who is the token smart guy, fixes the bootlegging equipment and machinery and is the youngest brother's timid nice friend who ends up being the second act martyr to move along to the third act. The youngest brother's love interest also plays a small role simply as 'love interest', and she just giggles and repeats ""if my daddy were here"", ""my daddy don't like you"", ""my daddy this"", ""my daddy that"", etc. You also have Gary Oldman, who was barely in the film and his name was slapped on for marketing purposes as the intimidating mobster who buys from the brothers for no reason other than he recognized the younger brother's face.

But now onto my favorite character: the evil FBI agent who wears all black, looks like a pale sickly Nazi, and pretty much tortures anyone who crosses him, all the while the police officers turn a blind eye. Early in the movie he asks someone ""do you think I'm stupid?"", which he apparently is since he does nothing the entire film but piss off the entire town (including the police officers). Also, you're supposed to believe that in the 1920's everyone in a Southern town that wasn't a criminal was a total coward. The agent saunters around town and terrorizes the populace without anyone raising questions or just shooting the guy. Sure he was a federal agent, but I think murdering the town cripple in cold blood would lead to his titles being stripped away from him at least. Sure there was some message about how fear controls people, but that's more applicable now with people sitting inside watching the media, not in the 1930's where people were still settling across the country.

So there's little depth to any of the characters, hell even Pulp Fiction had more character depth to it. But what about the story? Well the story is basically the agent slowly snaking his way farther and farther up the brother's asses until they decide to retaliate, which is the end of the movie. The story itself is kind of interesting, family protecting their business and what have you. One thing that was weird about the pace was how predictable it got. After the agent arrives into town, there would be a few 5 minute scenes where the youngest brother and his love interest would be flirting, and then SUDDENLY 20 MINUTES OF GRAPHIC VIOLENCE & DRAMA!!!! There was virtually no build-up to the climax of the movie because the pace never changed from STOP-GO-STOP-GO.

There were also a few scenes that were either plain stupid or plain annoying. Like for instance the police find the bootleg still, and the brothers never think to just burn the place down while the cops are there. Also in that scene, the youngest brother comes across the agent who's in his mercy, and before this scene, the agent beat the royal s*** out of the brother. So what does the brother do now in this opportune moment? Step on the agent's face and call him a queer or something. He doesn't break the guys teeth, he doesn't bruise up the guys face or kick him in the balls, no, our hero does nothing but some anti-climactic love tap then walks away. Also at the end of the movie, the youngest brother is pissed since his token smart best friend is dead, and wants to shoot the agent. So what does he do? He goes up to a police roadblock where the agent is among a dozen cops, and points his gun at all of them, and doesn't get shot immediately. No, the bad guy has to slither out from the darkness (literally) and shoot the brother. It's dumb, stupid, Hollywood s*** like this that pisses me off from these kinds of movies.

So it was entertaining most of the time in a 'how far will they take it this time' sorta way, it almost felt like a graphic novel or something due to the violence. Again, the music was great, which makes sense considering it was from the talented Nick Cave who also scored the infinitely better period piece: The Assassination of Jesse James. The acting was decent and so was the whole design, it was just unrealistic, shallow, and stupid a lot of the time.",1353974400,,5472,4.6652849740932645
5177469,3,B008OPZD8C,"For the first time, your family's livelihood is threatened. At the same time, you're trying to get out from under the shadow of your elders, one of whom is a local legend. Which takes priority?

  The Bondurant brothers are the owners and operators of the premier bootlegging operation in Franklin County, Virginia. Jack, the youngest (portrayed by Shia LaBouef) is assisting Howard (played by Jason Clarke) and Forrest (played by Tom Hardy) when he witnesses a shooting. The gunman, Floyd Banner (played by Gary Oldman), locks eyes with young Jack before he departs for the operation's headquarters. Once there, Forrest (Hardy) hires a new waitress. Her name is Maggie Beauford (played by Jessica Chastain) and she is a former dancer who's recently moved to Franklin County from Chicago. Shortly after that, the bootlegging business is confronted with an obstacle. Charlie Rakes, another new arrival and a Special Deputy. Rakes (played by Guy Pearce) tells Forrest that, from now on, he and his superiors will be given a percentage of the profits form their business. Forrest, as expected, sends Rakes away and threatens to kill him if he returns. After his departure, Forrest organizes a meeting of his colleagues in the illegal alcohol business. His hope is to rally them into a resistance movement. ""Bootleggers of the world unite"" if you will. While they are receptive, initially, it's only a matter of time before they capitulate to Deputy Rakes. In the meantime, Jack has become enamored with Bertha Minnix. Bertha (played by Mia Wasikowska) is the daughter of a local German Baptist preacher who forbids Bertha from seeing Jack once he attends one of his services drunk and leaves abruptly.

  This film is supposedly based on a historical novel written by the grandson of LaBouef's character. I don't know how faithful the film is to the novel or how historically accurate the novel is, but as far as I'm concerned, the movie failed. It isn't particularly awful, but it's not all that interesting either. I am surprised that former Disney star Shia LaBouef has actual talent, but he does and we've seen it. I am not at all surprised by the fact that Tom Hardy is talented as he has demonstrated it on numerous occasions. Maybe Lawless would be more engrossing if its release had predated the HBO series about Prohibition era bootlegging, Boardwalk Empire. Maybe not. All I can say is that I was underwhelmed. Maybe you won't be.",1353801600,,2437,4.946210268948655
5177470,4,B008OPZD8C,"By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, Mississippi

Lawless started out as a form on genealogy. Matt Bondurant knew his grandfather Jack Bondurant and his grand-uncles Forrest and Howard were bootleggers. This led to the historical novel The Wettest County in the World (2008). The book wound up in the hands of director John Hillcoat (The Road, The Proposition).
""Bootlegging sort of drew the Bondurants into this crazy kind of world of corruption and lawlessness ironically,"" Hillcoat said. ""But then mostly they survived, they got through it all and actually went on to have businesses and children. And traditionally the gangster film teaches us that we've to  pay for our sins. Usually the gangster is shot down in a blaze of glory and doesn't get up again.""
In the movie Lawless, the Bondurant brothers have created this almost immortal image. And according to how much of this actually happened, they certainly live up to that image.
It's 1931 and the brothers are the most successful bootleggers in Franklin County, Virginia. Cricket Pate runs their bar, which is a cover for their illegal venture.
Maggie Beauford, a dancer from Chicago, arrives and becomes their new waitress.
The brothers have been selling moonshine to everyone from clergy to law enforcement. Special Deputy Charley Rakes confronts Forrest and tells him things will be changing, that all profits made by bootleggers will stop. All bootleggers but the Bondurant brothers fold to Rakes demands.
Lawless is an intoxicating film, filled with brutal imagery and you can't help but pull for the backwoods boys.",1353456000,,1597,5.162162162162162
5177471,4,B008OPZD8C,"LAWLESS is inspired by the essentially true and fascinating adventures of the legendary, seemingly ""indestructible,"" Bondurant Brothers, bootleggers in Prohibition-era Virginia, who went to war against corrupt politicians and, in doing so, became heroes to their neighbors.

Shia LeBeouf, Tom Hardy and Jason Clarke play the backwoods siblings.  They only want to make an ""honest"" living, selling their moonshine at a fair price to people in their community, but when a crooked special deputy (Guy Pearce) demands a large cut of their action, the brothers refuse and that leads to violence, torture and murder.

Adapted for the screen by composer Nick Cave from a novel (based on fact) by Matt Bondurant, grandson of the character played in the film by LeBeouf, LAWLESS features a cast of intriguing, multi-dimensional characters, portrayed by some of the most talented actors in films today.  Jessica Chastain, as an emotionally damaged woman from Chicago who comes to work for the brothers, Mia Wasikowska, as a Mennonite girl courted by LeBeouf, and Gary Oldman, playing a big city gangster on the run, are also memorable in their roles

Director John Hillcoat and his team have flawlessly re-created backwoods Virginia of the early 1930s.  His action sequences are well staged and riveting.

Unfortunately, the film does have several slow spots, caused by the fact that the screenplay lacks focus.  Too much time is spent on two romantic subplots (i.e. LeBeouf/Wasikowska, Hardy/Chastain), which are, in themselves, touching, but these sequences distract from the primary storyline, the conflict between the brothers and Pearce's character.  LeBeouf serves as the narrator of the movie and has top billing, yet the filmmakers never make clear whether this is his story or Hardy's.

Anchor Bay Entertainment has issued LAWLESS in a 3-disc (Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital) combo pack.  Extras include audio commentary by director Hillcoat and author Matt Bondurant, deleted scenes, a music video and several featurettes that discuss the real brothers and the making of the film.
