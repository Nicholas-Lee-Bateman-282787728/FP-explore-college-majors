The quality of writing and direction is of such a high standard that the film simply flows. I cant remember the last character I saw Melissa Leo play, but that is because she becomes each character so completely that you forget it is her playing them. Anthony Keyvan, is in all senses, a worthy opposite for Leo; where Montine (Leo) is a neurotic mess, and a mass of contradictions, Omar is straight-forward and analytical, and exudes the sweetness and purity of youth spent in contemplation without worldliness. Prepare to fall in love with the protagonists, and to cry with despair at the same time as warming with optimism.",1399075200,,862,4.753333333333333

4972370,4,B0067YF076,"'The Space Between', is a quiet film that everyone who lived through the horror of 9/11 should see.  Melissa Leo, plays Montine McLeod, a burned out flight attendant, working to keep body and soul together. She is charged on this day to watch 9 year old, Omar Hassan, who is on his way to a Muslim Boarding School in LA. He has just left his father, his only relative in the world, and is sad and scared of this new world. He locks himself in the plane lavatory. Montine has no patience with anyone, never mind a scared young boy. The plane is forced to land in Houston, as the 9/11 horror was discharged.  She finds Omar as he is awakens and faces an empty plane. This is where the film really starts.

I would dare you to get through this film without tears. This film brings the humanity and joy back to the lives of those involved. It is not a sweet film, but a gritty face of reality, of people facing their foibles and their fears. Melissa Leo is a force to be reckoned with, what a terrific actress. The young man who plays Omar is also a terrific actor. Kudos to the entire cast. Please see this film, a tribute to those who are lost and those left behind.

4972374,4,B0067YF076,"This ""small"" but not ""independent"" film (it was produced for USA Network cable channel) is one of the first to deal with the issues of 9/11/2001 more than ten years after the tragic event. As my fellow Amazon reviewer K. Harris has detailed much of the plot, I won't repeat it here. (Actually, the less you know about the details of the script in this 86-minute film, the more you will enjoy it. There are enough twists and turns that will be ""spoiled"" if you know too much. And that's what drew me in.

Let me just say that Melissa Leo (the ""star"" name on the package) is an airline stewardess (with some serious personal issues - again I can't reveal them and her ""dream sequences"" at the beginning will reveal themselves later in the film) who finds herself accompanying a 10 year old Pakistani  boy (Omar) back to his father in New York City after the Twin Towers are hit on 9/11. They travel by various modes of transportations (all planes have been grounded) and make various stops on the way. Throughout their journey they learn from each other. Anthony Keyvan as Omar will find a way to get into your heart and - at times - shows more maturity than Leo's character.

The DVD has no ""special Features"" - and, of course, no trailer because it was originally produced for TV. But the film stands on its own and - though the ""bonding of two different people when thrown into a difficult situation"" is a very common theme, the performances make this a small film worth seeking out.

4972414,5,B0067YF076,"Great movie, worth watching more than once. Inspiring and uplifting;  very raw but shows what kind acts we are all capable of doing.  It offers hope to the realities we face, not just on 9/11 but everyday life.  Was wishing for a more conclusive ending but this movie lets us draw are own conclusions.  The 2 main characters are so brilliantly well written and so well rounded you get to know them more and more as their journey continues.  You are pulled into their lives and they let you feel every emotion of sadness, hoplessness, kindness and hopefulness. Because these characters became so real for me, it's a future I would've liked them to have had.  It's definitly worth watching. You come away greatly moved by it and the cascading affects it has on the two central character's and those around them. I definitely agree with the issue of Montine's alcoholism or the interpretation this plays in the movie. It may be secondary to the plot line but it also show's causal affect.  I'm only speaking for myself and quite frankly feel ashamed to say this, but the Oklahoma City attack seems to have lessened, only because it didn't have the magnitudinal affect of 9/11. As in the case of Montine and the bartender, he had no recollection of what happened on that date. Truly, the only ones that fully understand are the victims; whether you lived it or are greiving for the deceased or have been impacted closely to these events.  In the case of the character Montine, that was probably the trigger for her drinking. So in this regard too, if I could write the script for her future it would be free of alcohol and she would address the death of her husband on April 19th, 1995. For me it's worth watching again.",1404691200,,1716,4.584967320261438

A fictional account of 2 people in the aftermath of 9/11. Omar, a young boy who loses his father, and the flight attendant assigned to him on his flight to LA. On their quest to get back to NYC to find his father, they find a friendship, companionship, and understanding. Melissa Leo gave a great performance as the flight attendant.

8494480,5,B0067YF076,"MKL. I'm guess I'm moved in all sorts of ways by this movie. I live in Oklahoma City, and I was born in Oklahoma 71 years ago. I was witness to the  OKC bombing and I was at the rubble. It's very humbling. I'm currently Sikh (a faith which originated in Punjab state of India a little over 500 years ago), so I can relate to Omar's and his father's characters as Pakistanis.  I'm basically just a big softie, and I understand the cultures and the religions of the Indian sub-continent. There was a ton of emotion in this movie, which I was happy to see. For once it wasn't another Muslim-bashing movie, and by that I mean that it acknowledged Islam in a humanistic way. I see that and read about it almost every day. I've lost friends because of it. I find it so backward that aryan-minded people in the U.S. find Muslims so objectionable and many just assume they're all hate-mongering arabs and think that they're all of one mind. I found the scene with the older teen ruffians hitting Omar very typical, though I certainly understand the motivation. One thing that I noted was that there was not a lot of Muslim-bashing in the movie. I was glad to see that. There are millions upon millions of peace-loving Muslims in this country and all over the world. Though I'm not Muslim, I understand the religion. I loved young Anthony Keyvan's portrayal of Omar; it was sobering and sweet. Whether he's of Latin or Indo-Asian descent, he still played Omar's role very well. Melissa Leo also played the role of Montine very well.",1507507200,,1523,4.5144927536231885
