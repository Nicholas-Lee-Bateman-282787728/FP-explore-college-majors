3849670,5,B0025X4PEM,Great little movie.  Saw this several years ago on Pub Hub and then they removed it.  We enjoyed it much and wanted to see it again. Moves fast with some really funny lines. If you enjoy old classic movies this is a must see!  Thanks Amazon for offering these old classics.,1436832000,,273,4.313725490196078

3849673,3,B0025X4PEM,Movie was OK! I enjoyed watching it. Reporters back then may have gotten their story. And was able get them out of jam. When they got themselves in trouble compared to today. This movie had some humor in it and it was delightful to watch. I found myself laughing at different parts of this movie. Police officers being called FLAT foot I hadn't heard that in a long time. This movie also showed what drinking can do to a person in DESTROYING their marriage. And even loosing a job over it and this movie also showed what can do if a person gives it up. I had some awful time trying to hear it if it can be fix that would be great. All in all this movie was fine it had a happy ending thug gets caught. Reporter gets his BIG story and his wife and bonus pay rise. Whether he'll use it towards his marriage or drink it all up that will be another story. Anyway others may have found this movie boring. But as for me it was fun watching and Miss Carol Lombard. She was very young and beautiful what can I say that has already been said. But I will say THANKS for sharing.,1390867200,,1068,4.114832535885167
3849674,3,B0025X4PEM,old fashioned plot with bad actors.....wow. Just watched it to get me to sleep when I can't make it directly.nonononononononononononononono,1385596800,,139,6.0
3849675,3,B0025X4PEM,"A little slow, but still interesting. Mobsters and newsroom action that you have to follow through to the end. There are some interesting characters along the way too, especially the guy from the DA's office. I think this is Carol's 2nd major movie role, so she is quite young.",1366416000,,277,4.673469387755102
3849676,4,B0025X4PEM,"The reason to view is to see Carole Lombard before she became the film persona we think of. The plot is limited, the butch character both poor as an actress and politically incorrect...nevertheless this short film worth the while. And it will make clear, old films had weaknesses too.",1361923200,,284,4.816326530612245
3849677,4,B0025X4PEM,"At a time when talking movies are in their infancy, it is fun to see how they staged things.  The wealth of experience that did not exist then was supplemented by the wealth of innovation and innovators.

I liked how they showed the elevator with only a sliding door and the sound of an elevator pulley to give the impression of elevator movement.",1353715200,,347,4.492063492063492
3849678,1,B0025X4PEM,"I was really looking forward to watching this 1929 early talkie starring a very young Carole Lombard. However, I could only get through the first thirty minutes of the film before I had to give up and stop the DVD. The movie itself was okay, but the transfer was terrible.

The whole time that I watched the film, most of the actors' heads were cut off at the shoulders. This went on scene after scene. Talk about bad framing of the picture that appears on your TV screen. Come on, Alpha, you can do better than this.

There are lots of B-movie and Poverty Row movie fans who depend on Alpha for its vast catalog of quirky, obscure, and mostly public domain titles in many different genres. Alpha does a great job with its colorful and well-designed DVD cases. So how about putting that same amount of time and effort into the picture and sound quality of the movie that's inside the case.",1314662400,8,889,4.447852760736196
3849679,2,B0025X4PEM,"BIG NEWS is a 1929 sound film starring Robert Armstrong as a drunken newspaper reporter caught up in big city crime and corruption. The film itself is no great shakes, but the real reason to watch this DVD is to see a very young Carole Lombard. Lombard plays Armstrong's supportive, put-upon wife. It's not much of a role, but Lombard does a decent job. However, she is far from the mid 30's Lombard that most movie fans are familiar with. This film is so early in Lombard's career that she is billed as ""Carol"" instead of ""Carole"". Lombard developed an interest in numerology and added an e to her first name soon after this film.
 As for Alpha Video's DVD---the print is pretty bad. The framing is not very good--there are several scenes where the top of the characters' heads are cut off! The DVD clocks in at 66 minutes. I have a book on Lombard which lists the film's running time as 75 minutes. Having only seen the film on this DVD, it's hard to say if this is a complete version or not. If you are a Carole Lombard fan, you may want to purchase this as a chance to see her before she became a big star. She still looks gorgeous despite the poor quality of the DVD. If you are not a die-hard fan of Carole or early-sound cinema, this film may not be for you.",1247961600,21,1265,4.270833333333333

8351243,4,B0025X4PEM,"It takes a while to get into, but Armstrong and most of the supporting cast including Lombard turn in acceptable performances for its day.  Film and sound quality are barely adequate.",1483228800,,183,4.903225806451613
8351244,2,B0025X4PEM,"This is a 1929 B/W movie that should be classified as primitive. This big city action takes place in the late 1920s. It is about an alcoholic ace reporter (Robert Armstrong) whose habit causes workplace and also marital grief with wife Carole Lombard. On his way toward rehabilitation there is a murder. Ultimately all problems are resolved. The streaming copy had borderline picture quality. Poor sound made muffling rapid fire repartees difficult to even follow with CC.
If you are a fan or either star, or addicted to early sound films, you may want to see it. I would have not guessed the leading lady was Ms. Lombard, Lew Ayres was an errand boy, or Tom Kennedy a responsible police officer. Would benefit from an updating film rehabilitation.",1480032000,,748,4.8515625
