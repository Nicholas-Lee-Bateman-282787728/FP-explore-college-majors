I would love to see them have most guests on stage jamm'n along a little less to the script would be awesome, but the way they use pre recorded tracks to pull off live concerts, It would probably be hard to do.",1407024000,2,337,3.8285714285714287

6444772,5,B00KS6EPKC,"I just returned from Best Buy and watched this start to finish......
First off, the reason for the 5 star review
excellent video and audio quality (all the more recent Montreux films are tip top) and at 16 bucks retail ... heck I can't even buy parking at a concert around here for that price so to have this any time in HD .... excellent value for money.

While the video run time IS 93 minutes... only 80 minutes is concert.  Eagle Vision does this a lot , they include any and all bonus features in their run time.  There are two light weight interview segments that take up the rest of the listed ""run time"".  Normally I look for more than 80 minutes, but I think it might have been their full time slot (it is a pretty excellent 17 song selection including a couple from their latest).  On top of that Billy Gibbons doesn't gobble up a lot of time , if any, between songs.... bantering with the audience and that adds a lot of time to other concerts.

Is this a perfect concert BR?  No.... many solos are missed by the camera men/director , but does it have a lot of great songs? Yes. Does it feature a pretty excellent performance? Yes.  Is the group engaging the audience?  Yes.  There is a bit of an  annoying plug (excuse the pun) for Basic Amplifiers ... that keeps illuminating the stage set.... but did I mention the very tasty guitar tones?  I could listen to Billy vamp on a simple A Chord with that fuzzy distorted sound for hours on end...

Bottom line from an owner.  I'm very glad I picked this up.... nice addition to my other ZZ Top DVDs !",1405987200,29,1559,4.276450511945392
6444773,5,B00KS6EPKC,"My only time I've ever seen ZZ Top in person was fourteen years ago at Stevie Ray Vaughan's funeral (Note: Since originally posting this review, it came to my attention that my math was obviously way off. I didn't ""carry the one"" when I should have. Obviously, SRV was tragically killed 24 years ago next month - not 14 years ago. I'm leaving my mistake as originally written to keep me humble).  I have never seen ZZ Top live in concert.  To fill that void, however, is a new concert DVD by that ""lil' ol' band from Texas"" entitled, ""ZZ Top Live At Montreux 2013"".

The DVD is off-the-rails fantastic and is packed with classic ZZ Top hits such as ""La Grange,"" ""Gimme All Your Lovin,'"" ""Pincushion,"" ""Sharp Dressed Man,"" ""Waitin' For The Bus,"" ""Legs,"" ""Tube Snake Boogie,"" ""Tush,"" and many more. The set list blends tracks from early seventies albums such as ""Tres Hombres"" and ""Fandango"" through their eighties blockbuster period with ""Eliminator"" and ""Afterburner"" and up to their most recent release and return to their blues roots with ""La Futura."" The middle section of the concert features a jazz-blues tribute to the late Montreux Festival founder Claude Nobs with guest appearances by Mike Flanigin on Hammond Organ and Van Wilks on guitar.

What I particularly enjoyed was Top's tremendous treatment of Jimi Hendrix's ""Foxey Lady"".  Billy Gibbons' guitar work is par excellence as well as the solid foundational rhythm work of Dusty Hill (bass) and Frank Beard (drums). This one performance is worth the price of the entire DVD alone.

Yeah, it's that good.

With an unchanged line-up stretching back to 1969, ZZ Top continue to delight fans around the world with their instantly recognizable brand of blues-infused rock and unmatched live performances. Their iconic sound and image has earned the band (singer/guitarist/frontman Billy F Gibbons, bassist Dusty Hill, and drummer Frank Beard) global album sales in excess of 50 million and an induction in the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. Throughout their 40+ year career, the band has made a number of visits to Montreux over the years and this concert from the 2013 Festival is undoubtedly one of their finest live performances.

ZZ Top's ""Live At Montreux 2013"" represents that ""lil' ol' band from Texas' "" rip-roarin' live energy - rocking the blues as strongly as ever and is a definite must-have for every fan's video library.

6444779,1,B00KS6EPKC,"I would really like to give this disc more than one star because my wife and I are big ZZ Top fans, but this disc sucks. First of all there are two different audio tracks, a high resolution PCM stereo track and a DTS HDMaster audio surround sound track. I have an Oppo Blu Ray player and a pretty expensive surround sound set up, but both of these audio tracks sounded terrible. The stereo actually sounded livelier and fuller than the surround sound track, but they both sounded flat and lifeless. On a scale of 1 to 10 for audio, with 1 being terrible and 10 being stellar, I would give this disc a 2.

On the video side, the disc was even worse. The editing was so jumpy that you only get to watch a couple of seconds of a camera view at a time and then it switches to another camera view. For the video aspect of this disc I would rate it a big fat ZERO.

On the whole my wife and I could not tolerate this disc at all and I immediately gave it to the Goodwill. If you like ZZ Top, stay away from this terrible disc.",1476403200,2,1020,4.044554455445544

I still can't believe how these three musicians put out such a full sound to their music, unbelievable. Saw them play in Hartford. CT in the 1980's, the crowd in Hartford was certainly a bit more raucus and wild than the Montreax audience. Wish they played a few more of my favorites such as ""Rough Boy"" and ""Can't Stop Rockin'"" but of course newer material need to be worked into recent concerts.

Why you ask?
This is the first time in 45 years that Gibbons does not break out Pearly Gates (his vintage Les Paul) and play ""Just Got Paid Today"".
I could not believe it, and still cannot believe it.  When I ordered it, I assumed it was there like it always is.
I have seen them at least 20 times since 72 and have every album and dvd; and to my knowledge, this is the first time they have not played ""Just Got Paid Today"" from their epic 1972 album: Rio Grande Mud.

6444857,4,B00KS6EPKC,"Very satisfying! The only possible flaw (to an old, 58 year old ZZ fan who has seen them perhaps thirty times since seeing the Tres Hombres tour in summer '74) might be the tune selections. That is, I'm always craving the older tunes, mainly because of how those tunes were played/arranged in the days before ZZ played along with a pre-recorded tape loop, so as to fill in the studio synths, primarily. Never easy for a trio, but the boys always seems to pull its off in the old days (and various ""You Tube"" recordings confirm it's not just my memory tricking me - just listen to ""Chevrolet"" recorded in Washington DC during the WWTT in November 1976, I think!). Of course, with a record catalog as thick as ZZ has, I understand the dilemma, meaning, which tunes do we play that would have across-the-board recognition (or close to it) with the multi generational fan base?

I would guess if we are lucky enough to have them performing live for a few more years, the song selection heard on ""Live at Montreux"" will be more-or-less the compromise best suited to keep everyone happy. Still, I would have enjoyed ""Precious and Grace"" (from Tres Hombres"" or ""Francene"" (fro Rio Grande Mud"") just a little more than say ""Sharp Dressed Man"" or ""Legs"". But hey, I'm whining about subjective taste here anyway. Simply put, if your a hard core ZZ fan, there is actually darn near nuthin' to complain about!

during a tribute to Montreaux Jazz Founder Claude Nobs. Mike Flanigan and Van Wilks both put their Texas Touch and Tone on
with Billy G, Dusty,and Frank Quite a treat. Get it!!Won't regret it!!The Bird Is The Word!!!",1408233600,3,334,4.677966101694915
6444876,5,B00KS6EPKC,"Typical ZZ performance.  I've watched it twice already on the first day.  The main video is about an hour and 20 minutes long of stage music and nothing else.  There are a couple of interviews video extras that are under 10 minutes long.  The DVD quality is fine and the video and audio are in sync.  There was no in-sync movement between Gibbons and Hill, and Beard spent most of his time looking at something on the floor on his left side (a teleprompter?) but these fellows have been around since the late 1960s so I'll take any video I can get!  The main bass and guitar used for most of the show show their age and have seen a lot of good times.  The stage is simple  as is the background video displays.  You won't pay attention to them anyway, just ZZ Top.  17 songs are performed which span most of their career.  Some performance modifications are thrown in to keep you on your toes.  You will be happy with this DVD if you like ZZ Top.",1407888000,14,945,4.247191011235955

6444878,3,B00KS6EPKC,OK.  Not bad.  Im a huge ZZ Top fan.  Ive been enjoying their music since 1975.  Ive purchased EVERY release since then.  Ive seen them in concert eight times.  But this concert added nothing special to my collection.  Performed in front of questionably live Swiss audience (who obviously don't know how to rock).  The concert lacked the spark and energy of the previously released DVD Live in Texas (Where the do know how to rock).,1407196800,3,432,4.666666666666667
6444879,5,B00KS6EPKC,"This is one of those videos that make you wish you had a bigger screen. It is crystal clear picture quality and the production is excellent. The music, of course, is great.

Personal opinion, actually the best drums in the music. Mr Frank Beard is great!!!

This is a must to have for the ZZ Top fans.",1407024000,6,301,4.2631578947368425

8661112,5,B00KS6EPKC,"The picture and audio quality are top notch in this Blu-ray. I am a big fan of ZZ Top and was so disappointed in the first Blu-ray concert ""Live From Texas"". The audio quality is most important to me. I have a good surround sound system which increases the difference between a well engineered sound track and a not so well engineered sound track. I have over 50 blu-ray concerts and consider the ""Live From Texas"" sound track the worst. It sounds like they are performing in a tunnel. Not the case with ""Live at Montreux"". It has become one of my favorite concerts to show off my system. It is amazing how a three piece band can have such a big sound.",1516233600,,652,4.308943089430894
