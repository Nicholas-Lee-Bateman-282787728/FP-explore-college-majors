7914804,4,B00001U0DZ,"The story in this one follows a group of four young Tiger Village citizens, who are kung-fu experts. They are commissioned to guard an ambassador from asassination when he arrives in town.
Most of the film sets up the relationship between the young fighters and the ambassador's security man, as well as the various personality traits of the men (one is always making bets about the outcome of a given situation, another is a ladies man, and another likes to comb his hair and look cool, etc.). They work together to root out the hidden asassins lurking in the neighborhood before the ambassador comes to town. To make matters worse, the bad guys seem to know all of their plans and precautions, and the heroes suspect that there is a spy in their midst.
There is some early wire work on display in some of the fights, and Bionic Man-style leaps (in other words, the actor jumps down from a wall or tree limb during filming, and then they ran the film backwards to make it look like he jumped up there using kung-fu power). The dubbing is pretty good, and best of all, the film is shown in widescreen.
There's a lot of comedy, but this is basically a drama, so naturally there a few nasty turns of events. Likable cast, fight scenes, and action all around. Whether you're a serious kung-fu fan or just like to MST3k your way through kung-fu films, I think you'll enjoy this one.",1012176000,2,1378,4.516
