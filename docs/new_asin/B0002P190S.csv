8030115,5,B0002P190S,"Charles Aznavour is the consummate actor/composer/singer of the 20th Century.  This DVD demonstrates the depth of the man through his incredible performance.  I love the close-ups of his face and the dynamic versatility of his emotions.  Understood in English or French, this is a master.

Not to be missed by Aznavour fans.",1196640000,2,324,5.173076923076923
