 I am very impressed by Fahtiem's Bellydance bootcamp Vol 2 and have been doing this workout since my baby was 2 months old. I felt that other than swimming, this was the safest workout. (New Mommies: Please check with your doctor before taking my advice!)

As a new Mommy of an 8 month old baby, this workout allows me to burn fat thru aerobics and srtetch my muscles. HOWEVER, unlike other videos I have done, this one makes me feel beautiful & feels fun and relaxing even though I am burning fat. I'll attribute this to the perfect pace/tempo of the music and workout.
It's the perfect workout to heal my body after a day of lifting and lugging my baby everywhere!

As a professional singer/songwriter, I need to keep in tip top shape so I can be strong to travel and stand for long performances. II have added this workout as well as Ellen Barrett's Fat Burning Fusion and walking to my weekly workout agenda. Counting carbs and monitoring them is also part of my plan. I have lost a few inches in 2 weeks and have lost 5 pounds.

THANK YOU FATHIEM!

PS- Sweet memory: When my baby was an infant, she used to lay on her activity mat and watch me bellydance in awe! Her smiling face made me want to keep going knowing I was entertaining her and making myself strong enough to care for her.
