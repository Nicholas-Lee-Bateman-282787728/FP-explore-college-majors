Things that I've CHOSEN not to deal with because I had so little control over the scenario that it would only frustrate me as well as the person I was trying to ""fix"".
I have crazy in my family- don't misunderstand me... but Titus has ""given me permission"" to say ""I have enough crazy of my own- I don't need yours too.""

2296113,5,B0009K8LCA,"The first two seasons are a guaranteed worthwhile buy (at least in my opinion).  It's hilarious and yet is self-aware at all times, which leads to some thought provoking moments.  It'd be great if this show was still on the air now, especially in an era of ""politically correct"" when this show would throw a knockout punch and tell us all to ""quit being a wussy!""

2296127,5,B0009K8LCA,"If you watch Titus, you'll get the title! Titus.... man this is one hell of a show! The best dark humor out there! This is tied for my most favorite show because I could not decide between the two, the other being The Simpsons. I grew up with that show and it is STILL going strong! Anyways, went off topic for a moment. Only having 3 seasons, it's a downer knowing there are only 54 episodes, but just like Zack Ward (who does a great job as Dave) said in a interview which is in the extras of the DVD, it was kinda perfect that it only had 54 episodes. That might sound strange to some. I guess you can say Titus is like a shooting star compared to the regular stars in the sky that would represent other shows. Shined twice as bright and stood out, just amazing, but is gone before you know it and most never noticed it at all. I am happy I was able to enjoy Titus while it was on air. Also, most of what happens in the show has actually happened to the comedian Christopher Titus! Probably why it has that strong connection with those that have a twisted sense of humor like myself!

Titus is about a guy named Christopher Titus who narrates the show about his life in a room shot in black and white that is called the neutral space. Titus owns and runs a Hot Rod garage shop and works with his flamboyant (yet not gay) best friend Tommy, who can be anal at times, and his adopted brother Dave who can be quite the dimwitted pot head who is hilarious! He lives with his gorgeous girlfriend Erin who tries her best to be normal besides the fact that she grew up in a crazy disfunctional family just like Titus. Probably why she gets him and they do so well together. (Err.... um.... well up to a point. watch the seasons first before you watch Christopher Titus' stand up special Love is Evol) lol. Last, but not least, you have Papa Titus A.K.A Ken Titus who is a alcoholic womanizer that will having you laugh your a** off the most! He is the definition of tough love when we see flashbacks of him raising his sons Chris and Dave. That's also another thing in the show, flashbacks to Titus childhood, high school years, and past stories will come up during the show delivering lots of laughs! One example would be when we see Titus as a kid and he walks up to Papa Titus who is sitting in his chair and is watching tv. ""Daddy, my teacher said that we can grow up to be anything we want to be!"" and Papa Titus with a beer in hand ""He obviously wasn't talking to you son, now go in the back yard and start practicing digging trenches"" Just a taste of this great funny dark humored show!

Titus Seasons 1 & 2 have some great episodes! (season 2 has most of my favs) well they all are great, some I would say, are the top episodes like Perfect Thanksgiving, The Pit, The Pendulum, The Last Noelle, Dad's Dead, Dave moves out, and many more! Special features include interviews with some of the cast members, blooper reels, and audio commentary on some episodes. If you have a wicked sense of humor, GET THIS! you will not be dissapointed! And if you're easily offended, you might wanna steer clear of this masterpeice! or........ QUIT BEING A WUSSY!!!",1372636800,3,3152,4.295798319327731
2296128,5,B0009K8LCA,funny great hilarious some of the most outrageious comdey show ive seen next to married with children but it suck there was only 3 season,1360108800,,137,4.52
2296129,1,B0009K8LCA,"This is my first review on Amazon.  In fairness to Titus, I usually watch television series that involve drama but do enjoy well written, intelligent, and sometimes crude comedies as well.

Titus has 5 star reviews from every reviewer except 1 person whose comments were about the delivery of the product, not the show itself.

I only made it through 1 and a half episodes.  Did not laugh at one single joke or comment and feel strongly that this show was terrible. Nothing seemed interesting or intelligent and on top of everything it also has a ""laugh track"" that put me off.

It's almost like you are watching a play on television.  The first episode shows Titus talking about his father who Titus thinks is dead because he has not come out of his room in 4 days.

The entire episode takes place in the living room and kitchen and it's all conversation.

Titus talks to his brother, girlfriend, and friend.  In the end the father comes out of the room.

It was painful to watch.

I gave it another chance in episode 2 but nothing changed.  This time Titus at least leaves the house and goes to his girlfriend's place of work.  He believes she is flirting with someone and makes unfunny jokes/comments while the laugh track continues to blare.

In my opinion, there are far better television comedies to check out (Curb your Enthusiasm, Eastbound and Down, Family Guy) then this show and because of the high ratings, I feel the need to alert anyone who might consider this.",1354406400,,1475,4.601532567049809

2296133,4,B0009K8LCA,"""Titus"" was probably one of my all time favorite shows, and as I was telling a friend about it I was gearing up to order all three seasons.

That was until I saw the prices - $93.00 for new box sets and just under $50 bucks for used?

What in the world is up with that? Amazon has great pricing on most of their season box sets of TV series...
Why is this obscure show so highly priced?",1319760000,4,386,3.9358974358974357

The humour is great, I laughed so much that everyone else in the house came to see what was so funny and stayed to enjoy.",1318550400,,399,4.223684210526316

2296149,5,B0009K8LCA,Great experience. Item arrived sooner than expected. One of the funniest shows ever made. Titus has real talent to make people laugh.,1265846400,,133,5.090909090909091
2296150,5,B0009K8LCA,This TV show is one of the best I have seen in a long time. It is a shame that they pulled the show off air. The DVD is excellent quality & condition. I would recommend to all.,1241049600,,176,3.6578947368421053
2296151,5,B0009K8LCA,"But I just loved this show when it was on and had to buy the dvds.  The show about the heart attack was just the most hilarious thing ever.  I tried to explain an episode to my family and they just looked at my like ""you're sick, that's not funny"".  Oh but it is....it is.

It's hard to watch too many in a row b/c of all the crazy, but this series was great!",1231891200,,359,3.810810810810811
2296152,5,B0009K8LCA,"The first time I watched this series was the premiere. The commercials for it were some of the funniest/strangest that I'd ever seen for a new TV series,even for Fox. When I watched it,I was hooked from the first scene,Christopher Titus's intro of this too real to be real series about his life as a functioning disfunctual from the family from hell. It also features Cynthia Watros as his hot and almost too beautiful to be believed girlfriend. This is ,quite simply ,the funniest series that free TV has ever produced. If you like your humor dark,hilarious,irreverent and with absolutely no holds barred,this is the series for you. Buy IT !!!",1228089600,,644,4.8108108108108105
2296153,5,B0009K8LCA,"Titus is one of the funniest shows ever made. Seasons 1&2 are so funny, you may need oxygen on stand-by.",1218067200,,104,4.25
2296154,4,B0009K8LCA,I had got this DVD for my boyfriend as a gift and I personally had never seen this show. When we started watching it I found it to be interesting. It's about a guy who was raised with his brother by a father who cannot maintain relationships with woman very well. The main character is Christopher Titus who does these narrations between certain scenes to explain what is going on. He has a girlfriend that puts up with him and stays with him through good times and bad times. He has a business that he runs with his friend and his younger brother. His younger brother has a few screws lose but he is pretty funny. I loved the show after I watched the first episode. I only wish it was still on FOX now.,1214784000,4,703,4.214814814814815
2296155,5,B0009K8LCA,All I have to say is if you think his stand up is funny then you will love this.,1205193600,,80,3.263157894736842
2296166,5,B0009K8LCA,"if you enjoy comedy clubs and comedians in general, then you're sure to enjoy this show. Titus manages to turn his real-life family tragedies into comedic material in this t.v. series.  I guarantee you, you have never been exposed to this kind of comedy before (or since).  Like many reviewers have pointed out, this is truly 'dark comedy'.....if the 'Cosby Show' is at one end of the spectrum, then 'Titus' is at the other end.  What makes the show effective, (and funny) is how many viewers can relate to the trials that Titus goes through, in regard to family dysfunction.  Also enjoy season 3 on dvd as well.  A comedy classic.",1204070400,3,631,4.648648648648648

2296168,5,B0009K8LCA,"Titus is easily the funniest sitcom I've ever seen, for the simple reason: It keeps it real!. Damn FOX for cancelling it in it's prime! Most sitcoms have a happy family with minor problems that get fixed by the end of the day: not Titus. Titus often would focus on darker humor, such as death, schytzophrenia, drunkeness, and one characters alleged homosexually (Tommy). What's best about the show is that many of the events that take place actually happened to Christopher Titus throughout his life, and with his family...well, if you've heard him perform live, you can probably guess. My parents both love this show as much as I do, and I believe if you want something new for the family over the age of 12 to watch, then buy this show. If you don't, then quit being a wussy and then buy it.",1193443200,,793,4.513888888888889
2296169,5,B0009K8LCA,"Ok, so this is a comedy a tad on the dark side.  It is too funny.  I saw this show when it started in fox back in 2000.  Hated to see it go.  I was waiting and waiting until I forgot about it.  Then I said one day, what shows are out on DVD already.  I got this and the third season.  Fantastic.  You want laughs and are not easily offended this is it.  I do not recommend this for kids.  This is for a adults and take it for what it is.  Maybe it is not right to laugh about the jokes made here.  If you don't like it don't buy it.  If you have seen the show of his act, you will know what I mean.",1192060800,,598,3.578125

2296171,5,B0009K8LCA,Having the first 2 seasons of the Fox series Titus is great.  I was a big fan when it mysteriously disappeared from the Fox lineup without explanation.  It has been a real treat to get seasons 1 & 2 to watch whenever I want.  The writing and acting are great.  The charactes are unique and the situations bizarre.  It is hilarious.  If you are a fan of black humor and watch Titus.,1188172800,,381,4.222222222222222
2296172,5,B0009K8LCA,"Every so often, a TV comedy comes along that is truly edgy and different, where you find yourself wincing and thinking ""did he really just say that,"" right before you laugh.  Being edgy and different is not the same thing as being gratuitously offensive and crude, but rather is a function of diving deep into our psyche and our socialization and bringing up the nuggets of comedy hiding there.  For example, ""Titus"" is perhaps the only show in television history where an episode deals with the domestic abuse of a man by his old girlfriend - and it's comedy gold, without being a ""very special episode of Titus""!  ""Titus"" manages to walk the fine line of making light of the emotions and reactions that surround the horrific, without making light of the horrific itself.  Indeed, part of why ""Titus"" is so good is that we get nuggets of dramatic honesty from the characters that make us care about them, and in turn that makes the comedy even funnier.

The special features describe how ""Titus"" came to be, and the commentary tracks, unusual for a comedy show, are interesting and informative.

The first few episodes are taken directly from Christopher Titus' excellent ""Norman Rockwell is Bleeding"" comedy show, which is still broadcast from time to time on Comedy Central.  It's well worth watching if you have a chance.  If you like that, you will love this box set.

In my opinion, the first two seasons are the best, so this is the box set to get if you're going to get just one.  Although after you buy this, you will buy Season 3 anyway.  Season 3 is still funny, and better than most things on TV today, but the addition of Erin's niece to the cast in season 3 was a less-than-inspired idea that drags down some of those episodes.",1187308800,6,1741,4.601941747572815

Titus combines real life experiences, physical humor and depressing reality to create a sitcom with a message:  It might be broken, but it's family and there's nothing you can do to replace family.

I gave it 4 stars for being brave enough to show the world that sometimes comedy ain't funny.  But you'll get the point.",1178496000,,566,5.233333333333333

2296182,5,B0009K8LCA,"I do not watch much television, probably less than an hour a week on average. One of the extremely rare series that I sought out was ""Titus,"" a masterwork which was cancelled before its time, after three short, but brilliant, years. Most good comedy comes out of tragedy, and certainly Christopher Titus has had more than his share. His father was serially divorced, his mother was insane and later committed suicide, yet he was able to take that personal pain and turn it into a darkly funny stand-up act, and later this show.

This show broke new ground, and Fox was brave to let the show explore taboo areas such as divorce, abuse, insanity, and general familial dysfunction. The writing, direction, cinematography (it was the first show in High Definition), and most of all acting are perfect. Christopher Titus plays himself, the beautiful Cynthia Watros plays Erin, his girlfriend, and best of all Stacey Keach plays his dad. For my money Keach as Ken Titus is one of the greatest performances ever in prime time. The remaining cast is equally brilliant, and the guest stars (David Hyde Pierce, Jay Leno, etc.) are delightful.

The show is unique in its construction, and the black and white narrated segments are some of the best scenes ever filmed. Most are very funny, though some are powerful social commentary (a trend that became even more pronounced in season three.)

This show is truly unique: it takes situation comedy to a totally new level, and while it sometimes makes the viewer uncomfortable, it also challenges the viewer to look at themselves, their own fears, biases, and prejudices, and in the final analysis that's a good thing.

I can't recommend ""Titus"" highly enough. Yes it's very funny, but it's a lot more than that.",1165363200,23,1748,4.855704697986577

Based on Chris Titus' own life (dear heavens, you wonder how the boy survived), it's howling funny in places, tender in others, slightly risque in still others - a wonderful mix.

Just a little point of information for anyone interested - Season 1&2 is closed-captioned for the hearing impaired.  It doesn't have the ""CC"" on the box, but the small print does state so.",1154995200,,478,4.6

I find it amazing that FOX would only prove to have more balls than this show by canceling it. I guess people don't like to sympathize with the characters on screen let alone laugh.

Sure, this show pushed the boundaries of what was allowed on TV and made no apologies for it. It broke taboos before breaking taboos became the meme of current TV programming.

2296201,5,B0009K8LCA,"I hate comedy shows. Really. Those classic, popular, amazing comedies? I hate 'em. Those cool, neurotic groups of hysterical personalities? Change the channel in seconds. Don't think I'm prejudging them, either - I've worked shift with people who love those shows, and I've suffered....um, sat through episodes with as non-judgemental an attitude as a Bhuddist monk. And at the end? I was ready to take a butane torch to either the TV or my ears, just to end the pain. (Normal people will be upset by the butane torch comment. Screwed up people, who watch Titus, will laugh and nod.)

But despite hating comedy in general, I love this show. I love Christopher Titus, and Erin Fitzpatrick, and Dave, and Tommy, and Papa Titus, and Psycho Mom. I love the whole show. It's terrific. It's a life-affirming, heartwarming, positive take on the fact that even if you were completely screwed up as a kid by your family, you can make fun of it on primetime TV and everyone will laugh at the fact that you set yourself on fire - and then they'll cancel your show.

Sorry. I'm halfway through season 3, the sarcasm is catching.

HOW COULD THEY CANCEL THIS?!?!? Honestly I don't get it - but I'm so glad it came out on DVD!

Ok, on to the actual review. Like most new shows it starts out rough - they're a little uneasy around each other, and it's a little stilted. But it gets better - they get their timing down, it starts to flow, and by the end of season 2 they're really on the ball.

The show is about a guy named Christopher Titus, his Irish girlfriend Erin, his not-gay best friend Dave, his completely genetically unrelated brother Tommy (look Tommy, cows!), his very tough dad (Wussy!) and various other relations (Psycho Mom of the many personalities, Crazy Grandma, Amy the...um... no spoilers.)

There's drugs, stupidity, cars, alcholoism, abuse, 80's hair, insanity, and loads of parental violence - all  very funny stuff.  Sometimes it's sort of serious, mostly it's not, all of it's terrific.

I honestly don't think everybody's going to like it as much as I do. But if your childhood wasn't perfect, you'll get a kick out of it - and even if it was perfect you still might think it's funny.",1142726400,2,2195,4.63659793814433

I never saw the first season except for the Red Asphalt episode and it was great.  The first time I actually watched this show in the second Season (which was the season 2 premere) I was hooked on it and I started recording every episode on VHS.

2296214,5,B0009K8LCA,"There's a saying about humor that goes, ""Tragedy + time = comedy,"" and nowhere is this more apparent than in the television show TITUS. Based on the one-man show NORMAN ROCKWELL IS BLEEDING, written and performed by the show's star, comedian Christopher Titus, this was one of the funniest shows the Fox network ever put on the air. Christopher Titus plays the title character, who guides us through his screwed-up life accompanied by his half-crazy half brother Dave, incredibly anal best friend Tommy, equally screwed-up but loving fiancee Erin, and his unbelieveably tough-loving, hard-drinking, chain-smoking, but responsible father, Ken, who's been married five times, along with occasional visits from his manic-depressive schizophrenic mother.

These don't sound like the ingredients of a laugh-out-loud comedy, but the fact is, this show is hilarious. Some people may be offended by the content, but that's a good thing. There is nothing PC about this show, and it's hysterical because of this. The ""blank space"" monologues of Titus himself and frequent flashbacks that occur during the show round out the stories perfectly and add to the humor tremendously. This is, simply put, a great show.",1125705600,4,1201,5.321052631578947
2296215,5,B0009K8LCA,"If you never got to see Titus on Fox, you really missed out. Granted you have to be just a little bent to really enjoy it. But if you came from a strange, messed up family, you will feel like your at home in the Titus household.  With great acting, hilarous excentricities in the characters, and the best flashback scenes ever to be written, Titus was the best sitcom I've ever seen.

My only regret is there isn't more of it. Hopefully we will get season 3 soon as well. The great thing about Titus was that its about family values. It shows daily American life that no one else has the balls to show on TV. These people love each other, no matter how screwed up they are, and many times they hurt each other. And that's real. Everything from how women shouldn't put up with being abused, dealing with mental illness, raising your kids correctly, to gay rights in season three. (You have to love Chris Titus comparing people who just don't like gays, or blacks or anybody for no good reason to Nazis. It was one of the boldest statements about individual liberties ever see on TV and nobody seemed to notice it.)It was a character driven comedy. When was the last time we had a comedy where someone almost died, and we actually cared?

To top it off, you could never get a better character than Stacey Keach. The man is an amazing actor, and he really steals the show sometimes, with no effort at all. As if the we didn't love him in Mike Hammer shows, in this one he's the drunk, womanizing father that every woman would like to have at least one night with.  Chris Titus does an AMAZING job for a first time actor. I guess its easier when you are doing your one life, but still one of the best guys I've seen on TV in years.

I bought this the week it was released. If you ever got a chance to watch Titus, you know this is one of the only TV comedies worth buying on DVD.

2296225,5,B0009K8LCA,"It truly is a shame that FOX's Titus only lasted three seasons, although, in retrospect, it's amazing that it even did last that long.  The material is probably the darkest stuff I've seen on television (and this is a comedy, remember), the budget must have been tiny (there were only three main sets, and everything else looked recycled).  The show survived on its merit, but fortunately, it deserved all the acclaim it got, plus much more.

The show Titus is based off of comedian Christopher Titus' one man stage show entitled Norman Rockwell Is Bleeding, which in turn was based on his real life.  In fact, the members of Titus' family had to sign release forms, as the show was so close to real life.  Titus plays himself, a custom car shop owner who comes from a very dysfunctional family.  His father Ken Titus (Stacey Keach) is a womanizing alcoholic who takes the term ""tough love"" to a whole new level.  His mother Juanita (Julie Wagner/Frances Fisher) is a manic-depressive schizophrenic who, on many occasions, tried to kill Ken.  Half-brother Dave (Zack Ward) is a marijuana-smoking, unintelligent man-boy.  Titus' ""normal"" friend Tommy Shafter (David Shatraw) is sensitive and effeminante, which leads to him being at the butt of a lot of Ken's jokes.  Erin Fitzpatrick (Cynthia Watros) is Titus' loving (but equally screwed up) girlfriend.  She also comes from a dysfunctional family, but she does everything she can to forget about it.

The stories are told in a very interesting way; as everything is going on, there are frequent asides from Titus in a black and white ""neutral space"" where he narrates, comments, and sets up jokes.  A lot of the dialogue in the neutral space comes directly from Norman Rockwell Is Bleeding.  The plot of the episodes range from the group fearing that Ken is dead because he hasn't left his room in four days... not even to get a beer, to Titus and Erin breaking up, and having both of them hook up with other people within 10 minutes, only to want to get back together.

As you can see, this isn't Ozzie and Harriet.  The plots are extremely dark and twisted.  One episode deals with the group having an intervention so that Ken can START drinking again.  In the featurette Hard Laughs on the DVD, Titus confirms what I had pretty much known since I had seen the show; many of the plots barely got network approval.  Chris had to coax them into the episodes by explaining how funny they could be, and believe me, this is one of the funniest shows I have ever seen.  Very few shows on network television have ventured this far in terms of the kinds of stories they do (sure, there's Family Guy, but that's a different kind of edgy).  The people in this show are dysfunctional and real.  There is no weekly reconcilliation at the end of each episode.  In fact, it's lucky if the characters' situations aren't worse off by the end than they were at the beginning.

As I said earlier, this show had a tiny budget.  Aside from the three main sets (Titus' house, Ken's house, and the Titus High Performance garage), most of the others were definitely recycled, and it doesn't take too much of a trained eye to see old sets refurbished to look like something new (I'm pretty sure that the police station and the hospital were the same set).  Furthermore, it seemed like they just couldn't hold on to the actors who played recurring characters.  One character was in three episodes, and was played by someone new each time.  Juanita Titus was played by a different actress in each season (although they go into that in Hard Laughs, and it does make a kind of sense if you watch the show).  I'm surprised that they were able to get guest stars like David Hyde Pierce and Jay Leno to appear (although I'm guessing that they enjoyed the material and were willing to take a cut in their normal pay, just like Gary Oldman on Greg the Bunny).  A good number of the episodes dealt only with the main five characters, and didn't have guests at all.

As I said earlier, even though this show deserved more than just three seasons, I'm surprised that it got that many.  This is not a show with a big middle ground; most people either love it or hate it, and I'm guessing that there are more people who hate it than love it (although I'm guessing that most people haven't even seen it).  In Hard Laughs, Titus was saying how FOX got numerous angry letters protesting the show, and that a lot of people came up to him to insult him (although, he also said that people come up to him and are angry that the show was cancelled).  Despite everything that this show had going against it though, it did a great job with what it had.  It was hilarious and it was able to remain on the air for three great years.  It really is too bad that it wasn't on longer, with it on DVD now, I hope that more people will appreciate the genius behind this amazing show.",1121817600,106,4882,4.539428571428571

2296236,5,B0009K8LCA,"Some of the other reviewers already gave a basic synopsis of the plot of the show.  It's Christopher Titus sitting in a room explaning his life as it happens as well as talking about his childhood experiences complete with hilarious flashbacks.  First I want to say that very few shows actually make me laugh out loud.  Titus is one of those few.

For those who are curious about the show, but have never seen it, here's an explanation.  What made Titus hilarious is the comedic timing of the cast, more specifically, Stacy Keach who's portrayal of Chris's dad makes him one of the funniest characters I've ever seen on TV.  I know it sounds corny, but once you watch the show, you'll get it.  In particular, the flashbacks of the father-son moments between Keach and Titus as a child are what anchors many of the shows even though they sometimes serve no purpose to the plot.  The flashbacks get the biggest laughs and are in the same vain as the cut-to's in shows like Family Guy and the Simpsons.

Sadly, the show was never given a chance.  I watched it for the first time a few weeks after the premiere.  I got hooked and watched it each week.  Then Fox began switching the timeslot so much that I lost interest and then learned it had been canceled.  I never saw another episode again until this DVD set came out.  I had heard reviews that the show's humor didn't hold up since it's cancelation.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I watched the first episode, ""Dad's Dead"" and I laughed hysterically.

This is a funny show.  So few come along.  Thank god it's finally out on DVD.  Just watch it.  You won't regret it.",1121299200,4,1630,4.476190476190476
2296237,4,B0009K8LCA,"Nobody does Character driven sitcoms anymore.  Lots of comedies these days get their laughs by referencing things the viewer might be familiar with (See: The Simpsons, Family Guy, Futurama, Frasier, Murphy Brown) or by relying on cliche's about people (Home Improvements, Everybody Loves Raymond).

Titus was a throwback-- a character driven sitcom in the mold of The Honeymooners or the Drew Carey Show.  Their world is smallish-- it revolves around a handful of people (Christopher and his girlfriend, half brother, best friend and father).  The characters are exaggerated just enough to highlight life's foibles, but not enough to be completely ridiculous (""Soup Nazi"" anyone?)

Beyond that, the writing is tight, sharp, and clever.  But it's not a self-aware cleverness-- not one that pokes you in the ribs and says ""SEE HOW SMART OUR WRITERS ARE?""

That was probably it's undoing.

As Philip J Frie said of television in Futurama:  ""Clever things make people feel stupid.""  He's right on the money.  TV shows that are smart AND subtle about it don't make the cut-- just ask Barry Sonnenfeld about The Tick.

But enough soapboxing.  The show is extremely well paced.  The key to comedy, as many have said before, is timing.  And the timing is absolutely superb in Titus.  Just watch ""Dad's Dead"" if you want to see comic timing done well.  It's so good, you won't notice it.  You'll just laugh.

Titus is a bang-up comedy.  I recommend it to anyone.",1121299200,4,1453,4.950207468879668
2296238,5,B0009K8LCA,"I saw a couple of the first episodes and loved them.  Unfortunately after that I stopped watching because the show kept changing days and times and I kept missing them.  The show deserved better treatment as the comedic writing was excellent.

Christopher Titus stars as a hot body shop owner who has a naive brother, Dave, a paranoid and coward friend, Tommy, a very supportive girlfriend, Erin, and an abusive, alcoholic father, ""DAD.""  Each episode begins as Titus is inside a closet giving a monologue and telling flashbacks of his high school days in the 80s.  It is hilarious seeing him protray his youth.  The rest of the episode involves some of the best comedy on television.  From Titus's accusation of Erin's affair, his father's intervention to start drinking again, to Tommy's crazy ""girlfriend"".

This is a twisted comedy along the lines of ""Married with children"" and ""Arrested Development"".  It is great to finally see it on DVD, but it is a shame not to have seen this comedy run longer.  It had the highest rating over 2 other shows, but it's over-the-edge comedy was too much for FOX.  I recommend getting this DVD as this is a hilarious, dysfunctional family sitcom with black comedy and physical humor.

BTW Christopher Titus stills tours and I heard he will return to television with another twisted show.  Hopefully it appears on Comedy Central, where limits can be pushed!!!",1121040000,,1398,4.872881355932203
2296239,5,B0009K8LCA,"Titus was a bitterly funny, viciously dark comedy done wrong by the infamously moronic people who run Fox.  This show should have stayed on the air until all the actors and writers died of old age--it was good enough to merit a much, much longer run than it actually had.  Titus features one of the funniest, most dysfunctional families to ever grace the small screen.  Even better, there was a deadly serious undercurrent to the humor, as comedian Christopher Titus examined the deep dysfunction of families and life in general.  This DVD belongs in the collection of every person with a sense of humor and a brain (and there are a lot fewer of these people running around than you might think--just look at the folks who run Fox, for example.  Nary a sense of humor or a shred of brain matter between them.).",1120608000,9,810,4.597222222222222
2296240,4,B0009K8LCA,"Fox Television proves that wild dysfunctional families deliver big laughs in the hilarious comedy series ""Titus"". If you though that the people in your life are pretty outrageous, then let Christopher Titus truly enlightened you. The half-hour comedy focuses on the wacky world of Christopher Titus (Himself) and his messed-up family including his supportive girlfriend Erin (Cynthia Watros), his clueless brother Dave (Zack Ward), his emotional friend Tommy (David Shatraw) and his drunken father Ken (Stacy Keach). Based on comedian Christopher Titus' stand-up routine, ""Titus"" is the most outrageously funny Fox comedy since ""Married with Children"". Each episode is narrated by Titus from his ""neutral space"" who offers some side-splitting comments and humorous flashbacks from his childhood and teenage years. The comedy series features some great humor, well developed interaction, memorable situations and good comic performances. The amusing interplay between Christopher and his father is one of the show's biggest highlights. This fine box set includes such amusing episodes like ""The Break-up"", ""Intervention"", ""The Perfect Thanksgiving"", ""Red Asphalt"" and much more.

If you've followed this wildly entertaining Fox series, then you're definitely going to enjoy ""Titus: Seasons 1 & 2"". All 31 episodes are presented in their original full screen format. This 6-Disc box set contains a clear picture quality and a good Dolby Digital 2.0 sound. Its special features include audio commentaries with series creators on two episodes, some behind-the-scenes footage, series promos, production notes and the ""Hard Laughs"" interview with Christopher Titus.

I was new to the ""Titus"" show during Season 2 (so the nine episodes of Season 1 will be 100% new to me), I fell in love with the show because of the dark and witty humor.

As someone else said below Stacy Keach has to be one of the best, if not the best, TV dad in history. He wasn't just a jerk, when he wanted to be he could be the most loving father in the world, in his own sick way.

I always thought that each episode had some type of meaning in them, maybe I was playing too much into it, but I thought it was there. Not matter how screwed up, and dysfunction, your family is, they are still family, even if they aren't blood. That was the whole series. Family.",1119657600,3,694,3.9078014184397163

And yet, there was always a lesson to be learned albeit through dysfunction to such an extreme that it must have scared people that they could find themselves laughing at it.

Christopher Titus writing was superb and the casting of Stacy Keach should go down in infamy as the ""best"" TV dad in the history of sitcoms.

This show was cancelled before it ever had a chance to catch on.  Hopefully through DVD release a larger audience can be reached who will appreciate some of the darkest humor to ever grace a television screen.",1118534400,12,670,4.741379310344827

On a serious note, it continuously touched on how important a strong family is for the individual. They just portrayed it from the negative point of view, showing you how screwed up a family can be due to bad parenting.",1118361600,5,379,4.921875

This show actually covered a lot of interesting topics that Christoper Titus ran across in his mid twenties and high school year's in flashback scenes. Some funny highlights from this classic show ran from the episode where he goes to his then girlfriends work pretending not to know her. While there Titus discovers she got some panties from a secert admirer. Titus goes on to finally wedge out of some guy that he had a crush on his girlfriend yet didn't know where the panties came from. Titus goes nuts and finds most of the office has the hot's from his girlfriend. Finally she's back and he finds out it's her boss who's a chick!!! Another great episode is where Titus's girlfriend thinks she can get his old man to enjoy christmas! Oh in the end they discover he enjoys christmas in a twisted twist!

2296247,5,B0009K8LCA,"It's about time this made it to DVD! I can never imagine why Fox pulled it after season 3, but I do know that I've been awaiting this for years. This show is a comedy about a dysfunctional family (so it relates to a lot of our own families) involving two brothers played by Christopher Titus and Zack Ward, and their friends dealing with a crude alcoholic father. Essentially, the father has ruined their lives and his own. The show utilizes flashbacks and current day situations but all from the mind of Chris Titus and how he remembered it. I love that we see his mind as a drab room with what looks like an electrocution chair for him to sit in occasionally. To sum it up in one word, hilarious!

If you've seen Titus I know you'll be purchasing this DVD. If you haven't seen Titus this is a DVD we all should own. Either way you will not be let down by the nonstop laughs.

2296249,5,B0009K8LCA,"One of my FAVORITE shows on FOX is finally coming out on DVD!  I looked forward to hearing Christopher Titus's unique views on life as he, his idiot brother Dave, nancy-boy friend Tommy, girlfriend/fiancee Erin, and his boosing, chain-smoking, womanizing father Ken Titus plow through their screwed-up low-class lives, with hilarious results!  Stacy Keach delivers a wickedly gleeful performance as Ken, while Zach Ward makes you think he really is an idiot as Dave.  Cynthia Watros, who's quite attractive, IMO, provides a voice of sanity to the otherwise crazy stars of the show. The one good thing from Titus's cancellation, was Cynthia's moving over to 'The Drew Carey Show', as Kellie.  So when will that show be released on DVD?!

The show only lasted a lousy three years, before falling victim, like almost every good show these days, to these awful reality shows, like 'Survivor', the 'Apprentice', and 'The Real Gilligan's Island', but it's dark humor also examines serious issues through the eyes of the 'screwed-up' person (and there are a lot more in this world than anyone would like to admit) and in many cases makes you consider . . . who exactly is the screwed-up person?

Doesn't change my opinion though - still one of my favorites!

8062352,4,B0009K8LCA,"I'll never understand how critics and audiences failed to be won over by the groundbreaking sitcom. Christopher Titus uses his series to discuss relationship with his parents, girlfriend, friend and stepbrother.

The cast is brilliant with Cynthia Watros as his loving and understanding girlfriend Erin Fitzpatrick. Zachary Shaw is terrific as his brother Dave. David Shatraw was terrific as friend, Tommy Shaftee. Stacy Keach should have earned Emmys for his performance as Titus' womanizing and drinking dad, Kenneth Titus.

This was a smart funny series on Fox and aired from 2000 to 2003. Titus's mother, Juanita, had manic depressive and paranoid schizophrenia. This series deserved better by Fox and critics and audiences. It was groundbreaking for showing dysfunctional families like the Titus family and Erin's family as well. I thought Christine Estabrook was the best actress to play Juanita Titus. By second season, Frances Fisher played the role.

There were guest performances by Richard Benjamin, Mary Lou Rosato and David Hyde Pierce (his husband Brian Hargrove was an executive producer) among them. The show was well-written and executed by a top notch cast. This show wasn't treated as well by it's network or it would have ran for several seasons instead of just three.

Once Christopher Titus stopped talking about cars and girlfriends, he started talking about his highly dysfunctional family. His own experiences helped others in the audiences of his stand-up act relate to him better. Christopher Titus and Erin are no more sadly after years together. Still the laughter from this show is best expressed in ""The Perfect Thanksgiving"" episode with both families there and ending up in the emergency room at the hospital.

Too bad, there were no special features like the behind the scenes, gag reels and the story behind the show. Christopher Titus is a brilliant comedian. The show tackled difficult issues like domestic violence (Christopher was the victim by a troubled ex-girlfriend revealed in the ""Last Noelle"" episode); drug and alcohol use; mental illness and more. If you ever thought that you're family was crazy, this show is perfect for you.",1484092800,,2175,5.256484149855908
8062353,5,B0009K8LCA,"Maybe you have to be a product of the times, but Titus was so relatable.  the show came out when no one else was doing anything like this on tv - edgy, dark, wild humor.",1470009600,,169,3.8285714285714287
8062354,5,B0009K8LCA,"Chances are, anyone reading this by now was a fan of the show when it was originally on the air, going on 15+ years ago now, and wants to try and get a hold of the DVD.  They are around, but you really have to do some price shopping, because they are out of print and for a good copy you can pay a very exorbitant price.  This set is generally more available than season 3, which tends to be the higher priced of the two sets, but if you watch auction sites and/or keep an eye on third party sellers you can grab them for relatively good deals.  But just be aware you are likely going to have to pay more now than the discs are actually worth.

That said, Titus was a great show.  In some ways it was a sitcom in name only, because it tackled very big issues like alcoholism, domestic abuse, suicide, murder, drugs etc.  It was based on Christopher Titus' stand up comedy show Norman Rockwell is bleeding, where he basically tells a bunch of stories from his life growing up in a dysfunctional family.  If Arrested Development was the upper crust (and very fictionalized) version of a messed up family, this was the lower class, trailer park (and more real) version.  The acting and writing were great, and the show had a unique ability to get a laugh out of any subject, no matter how serious.  But it could turn on a dime from being funny to ultra serious in a few seconds.

Stacy Keach pretty much stole every scene he was in as Ken Titus, the hard drinking, chain smoking, womanizing father.  Anyone who is old enough to remember him trying to play his tough guy roles in the 1980s was probably amazed at the comedic chops he had, and how much better he did in that role than his others.  The cast was rounded out by Cynthia Watros (playing Titus' girlfriend), Zack Ward as his hilarious burnout brother, and David Shawtraw as his ""normal"" friend.  The show balanced all the great characters well, and really gave them all equal time, even having shows where one character would barely appear to give more time to the others.

For those who get the DVDs, they were produced after the show was cancelled by fox, so they are very bare bones.  There are commentary tracks on a few episodes with Christopher Titus and two of the show's creators/producers.  On the third disc there is also a rehearsal reel and a half hour look back on the series that gave some insight into why, despite the fact that it got decent ratings, it ended up being cancelled.  It is ultimately a controversial show that pushed the bounds of a sitcom, even more than Married With Children did in some ways.  If you grew up in, or even had tangential experience with a dysfunctional family chances are you will relate to the show and really like it.  If that was not your experience you may be appalled by and hate the show.  I am not sure how much middle ground there is between those who love and hate the show, but I love it enough to think it is worth paying extra for the out of print DVDs if you can find them at a reasonable price.",1469836800,,3013,4.336898395721925
