2624990,4,B000H0M3VC,"All they did was take the original vhs film from the 1969 film and convert it to dvd.  Not that the original is horrible, but gezz couldn't MLB do better than this and show a bit of creativity?  It does capture the great moments of the film, from agee's two catches, ron swaboda's catch to the victory.  1986 is the clips from Vin Skulley national TV broadcast showing Boston thinking they were about to win to the ball under Buck's legs to the Mets victory.  It worth buying, could be better and longer at 45 mins each winning year on a dvd.",1160092800,9,542,4.284313725490196

2624998,3,B000H0M3VC,"A longtime Tommie Agee fan from Brooklyn, I finally picked up this DVD title. While I expected the 1969 series section to be based on old television footage, MLB productions could have supplemented the game footage with interviews of those players/coaches/commentators still alive. I forgot that Yogi Berra was the Mets' first base coach during the series. And the way Mark Bellanger would choke up on his bat. The 1986 footage is more disappointing. I would say the 1986 section actually detracts from the actual drama of the games. It is presented so flatly. And where are interviews with Mookie Wilson and Bill Buckner? The soundtrack is also a bit strange as they seemed to used canned stadium sounds instead of the actual sounds of the game.",1200787200,4,746,4.881889763779528

2625000,2,B000H0M3VC,"I purchased this DVD with the thought of replacing my VHS versions of same.  I expected Joe Garagiola & Vin Scully narrating the 1986 World Series as they did on television and Lindsay Nelson & Curt Gowdy for the 1969 which were the official broadcasters on NBC.  I got neither.  If you own these World Series classics on VHS, don't discard them for this DVD.",1168300800,12,359,4.492307692307692
