1330108,4,B00003G4IR,"My daughter has been a fan of Elmo from the time she was 4 months old, her pediatrician even sings the theme song for her on visits (thats how I get her to stay still for a few seconds).  She just beams when she hears that theme song and starts to jump.  She could be anywhere in the house and when she hears that theme song -- its move out of the way -- baby is on the move.  She is now 3 weeks shy of her 1st birthday and still is in love with her Elmo!",1008720000,4,455,3.670103092783505
1330109,2,B00003G4IR,"Parents may want to consider before purchasing: can you tolerate Elmo for almost an hour with very little break ? Well, if you think you can, you may find this an adequate video. I am surprised to see it advertised as appropriate for 2 through 5-year-olds because the material is extremely basic. The video contains three episodes devoted to music, dancing and books respectively. The music segment,for example, shows brief snippets of three children playing drums, an amusing cartoon about the first musical group on earth, and Mr. Noodles pondering the intricacies of wearing and playing a bass drum. If you compare the way music is approached in the ""Blues Clues"" series, the latter comes off much better because listening skills are actually taught. Too often the Elmo tape is just silly and I cannot imagine children learning anything about music from it. I certainly cannot imagine a child beyond the age of three being interested in it. Really you'd do better to buy a tin drum which at least would provide an authentic experience for your child. On the other hand, sometimes silly is good and  I cannot fault Elmo's enthusiasm. Still, I wish it were directed in a more interesting way.",1001289600,33,1193,4.876847290640394
1330110,5,B00003G4IR,"My daughter, 17 months, has been a Sesame Street fan for about 3 months now.  No matter what she's doing, she stops cold as soon as the Elmo's World theme music starts!  Now, if we're ever out and unable to catch the day's episode of Sesame Street, she never has to go without Elmo's World!  What's great about this video (and the 3 other volumes that have since come out!) is that it contains 3 complete episodes of Elmo's World!  You can either really treat your child, and let them watch all 3 (heaven on earth, in their minds), or ""ration"" them out, one at a time, if you just need 15 minutes to get dinner on, relax (what's that?), or whatever.  If your little one needs that Elmo ""fix"", get this video, and all the other Elmo's World videos!  They're well worth the money!",973209600,30,778,4.3310344827586205
1330111,5,B00003G4IR,"Elmo, Elmo, and more Elmo...If your child loves Elmo as much as mine, he or she will scream with delight every time this video starts.  This tape will get your child singing and dancing with joy.  My son particularly  loves the dancing vignette and tries to Can-Can along with Elmo and the  dancers!  I definitely recommend this one.",954460800,29,333,4.672413793103448

When we get home in the afternoon he says the same thing or sometimes he will say ""ala la la"" (which is part of the opening music).

It didn't seem constrained by anything and there was no force needed.  To be honest really not sure what happened exactly.

When I purchased this I did not realize that one of the three segments is the same as one of the segments in the ""What Makes you Happy"" Elmo's World DVD. Had I known that I probably would have purchased a different DVD with three segments that he does not already have. The segment that repeats itself is the dancing segment. Anyone with a child who loves Elmo's World knows that you'll end up watching the DVD's over and over again. He doesn't seem to mind seeing the same segment than twice in two videos, but it can drive me crazy. Other than that this is just as good as any of the other Elmo's World DVD's. I like that it introduces books since my son started watching this before he was interested in having us read him any of his books, and now he seems more interested in his books. I highly recommend it if your child likes Elmo.",1234569600,,913,4.222857142857142

1330320,4,B00003G4IR,"My two year old is an Elmo lover so we have been collecting Elmo DVDs and this one ranks at the top.  I have to say so far all of the Elmo's World DVDs have proven to be good viewing for my toddler.  She absolutely loves all of the singing, dancing and educational interaction that the DVD has to offer.  I even caught her humming the Elmo's World song one day.  I too disagree with the negative feedback because it doesn't hold their childs attention long enough, well when it comes to toddlers you are lucky if anything holds their attention for more than 5-10 minutes.  Even though the DVD is only 50 minutes long my daughter will usually sit for at least thirty minutes and that was the other thing that impressed me about these Elmo DVDs.

The first Elmo DVD she got was Elmo and the Great Outdoors and she totally fell in love with it and she was watching it every day.  She sat for that DVD for almost the entire 50 minutes.  I have to say all of the Elmo's World DVDs get a thumbs up from me and I will continue to buy them (for my sanity) because she can watch the same one over and over again.",1164240000,2,1103,4.145539906103286

Like the 'famous' personalities. Sorry - but my toddler isn't going to know who Rosie O'Donnell or The Fujis are (examples from various SW videos we've purchased). 5 stars minus 1 for wasting time/money on things that won't matter for a child.",1121731200,3,417,4.791666666666667

Now at 15 months old on a whim I played it for him. He loves it soooo much this is the ONLY video he will watch. We have the Baby Einstein collection and while as a baby he did enjoy watching those now he could care less about them. He is a very active toddler. His favorite thing to do is run around and climb stairs. He will not sit still for even a few minutes. I can count on this video to entertain him while I finish cooking or cleaning. No other toys or videos have given me this opportunity.",1114732800,15,664,3.818840579710145
1330334,4,B00003G4IR,"Our two-year old loves all things Elmo but this DVD stands out among all of the others.

It contains three episodes of ""Elmo's World"".  Each episode follows a similar flow of events while covering different topics:  dancing, books and music.  Each episode contains

*  funny skits (Our son always laughs at the misadventures of Mr. Noodle.  In case you have a preference, all three episodes on this DVD have the ""original"" Mr. Noodle played by Bill Irwin rather than the newer one played by the late Michael Jeter)

*  songs and counting exercises that encourage active participation (he mimics the hokey pokey and points to the counting objects as they appear on the screen)

*  instructional live-action video clips.  For example, the ""Reading"" episode has a clip on the basics of how the library works and encourages kids to have their parents take them there.  This will obviously be lost on younger toddlers, but shows how the content will be interesting to a wide variety of ages.

The episode format is great for younger toddlers because they can key in on what type of skit or song is upcoming after only a few viewings.  Other Elmo DVDs (i.e. ""The Best of Elmo"") don't follow this pattern, and so he's not as interested in them at this young age;  those DVDs function more as sing-alongs for older toddlers.

I disagree with some of the other negative reviews based on the disc's inability to hold a toddler's complete attention for the whole hour.  First off, I doubt that there's anything in the world that could hold a two-year old's complete attention for more than ten minutes.  Second, I believe that programs like this one are most beneficial when your child enjoys its content  interactively along with others.  We love watching this DVD along with him and he loves showing off how he can dance along with it and point out and name specific objects.

Another criticism that I've seen stems from the commercials that are at the very beginning of the main program.  You can skip past these trailers for other Sesame Street DVDs just by advancing to the next chapter.  One button - not hard at all.

In summary, this DVD has great educational content for kids within a wide range of ages and it's very entertaining as well.",1106179200,121,2237,4.703608247422681

I give this 4 stars because the shows on Elmo's TV were not very good and the book song starts to get annoying. Mr. Noodle's brother Mr. Noodle is a much better actor than Mr. Noodle and his section is funnier. Despite all of  this I think it was a pretty good DVD.
