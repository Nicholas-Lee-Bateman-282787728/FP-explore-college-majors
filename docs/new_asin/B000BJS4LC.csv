8087502,4,B000BJS4LC,"This is a very good Dora DVD.We bought this one for our granddaughter a few days ago and she has watched it several times. There are 4 episodes. Dora and Diego to the Rescue is about Boots getting blown away on his kite all the way to Polar Bear Mountain and needs Dora and Diego to rescue him. This episode was a new one,but has been shown on the Dora series frequently this month. Swiper the Explorer is a new episode about Swiper helping a lost baby fox. This is the one that Kiersten likes best. Boot's Cuddly Dinosaur has Boots and Dora looking for Boot's stuffed dinosaur that has gotten lost and Roberto the Robot has Dora and Boots helping a robot find his way back home. This is an episode that is shown infrequently. This DVD is worth buying. We purchased it at Wal Mart for under $11.00.",1138665600,13,798,4.326666666666667
