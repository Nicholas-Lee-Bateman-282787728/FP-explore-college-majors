WHAT A JOY! Thank you",1513296000,,244,5.125
8109618,2,B000EGZ8TI,"A few interesting documentaries but poorly done.  I think there is something to animal communication but this is not convincing.  A much better in depth is Animal Communicator Anna's DVD which includes the widely popular UTube Black Leopard ""How Diabolo changed to Spirit"" documentary, available out of Africa.  Shipping is a bit high though.",1503792000,,342,5.296296296296297

8109621,5,B000EGZ8TI,"This DVD is wonderful! I had always dreamed of speaking directly with animals and several years ago I took the plunge into a new way of living: I took in-person courses with the original teacher of animal communication, the wonderful Penelope Smith! In a few short hours, I learned how to speak with animals, including a wonderful little dog, a llama, a snake, and several flies. Yes, flies! They were very sweet! And since then, I have practiced with my own cats and with friends' animals and have been having a wonderful time. This DVD is a great introduction to the whole concept and practice of animal communication. Yes, you can actually tune in and have regular conversations with other beings. Like Penelope says, we are all truly born with this ability and can recover it with a little practice. And if you want to achieve a higher consciousness of the ""Oneness of All Life"" on Planet Earth, this is a fantastic way to develop your spirituality and open your heart to love and togetherness in all forms. Our animal friends have lots to teach us about love and harmony and just plain fun! Penelope is a Master Teacher and you can do no better than starting with this terrific DVD.
