4855343,5,B005OZBXT8,"I saw this play live in Houston. I tell you the Spirit of the Lord was in the house during the church scenes. I immeidately wrote the playright and begged her to put this on DVD or bring it back to Houston again. It is a must see. I have seen many plays: both live and on video - I repeat this is a must see. It is real reality TV.

I have already ordered my copy. Thank you Ms. Dunlap for allowing God to use you mightly. I pray your continued success.",1325203200,15,453,3.870967741935484

4855350,5,B005OZBXT8,I love the play and the energy it gave from the gospel singing and acting ability. The message of the play is the experience of finding out what is right and how the wrong things can destroy what is good for you and the ones who love you.,1412467200,,238,3.9791666666666665

4855359,3,B005OZBXT8,"It was more like a play...I was expecting it to be similar to the movie ""Preacher's Kid."" It didn't. I haven't even watched the entire thing just because it hasn't been interesting... :(",1363305600,,186,4.666666666666667

4855361,2,B005OZBXT8,I did not like this play at all! It seems to fake. I was expecting something more since I read the reviews before purchasing the play. Didn't like it at all!!,1356912000,,158,4.129032258064516

4855365,5,B005OZBXT8,"I loved this play from start to finish! Kudos to the entire cast! You all did your thang for real!!!

There's nothing like having God ordering your steps. When you fall down, you get back up again. He will make a way, if we don't faint, cave in or give up.

I want to see a sequel!",1344470400,,281,3.912280701754386
4855366,1,B005OZBXT8,"I had to force myself to sit and finish the play. When I looked around, I was the only one watching, everyone else fell asleep. Wasted $ on a rental.",1338681600,2,149,4.0

4855368,2,B005OZBXT8,"So, if you are into musical, theater like show and like church songs. This ""movie"" (It look mmore like a series to me)is for U. It's not bad but I expect something else. I giving this DVD a 2 start because I'm not into this type on movie, but it's ok.",1337212800,,251,3.9411764705882355
4855369,3,B005OZBXT8,"This play had nice elements, but the singing was a bit too much at times, and of course, like most stage plays, a little too dramatic and unrealistic.  I did like the premise...the Prodigal Son with a twist.  Glad I watched it on BET for free though.",1336262400,,250,4.297872340425532
4855370,5,B005OZBXT8,"This movie pulls you in through gospel singing, church, worship.  It's like the prodigal son who lost his way but was accepted back into the fold. The young women in this movie destroys herself over her fathers lies & deceit.  It takes her to almost lose her life to come back into the fold. It's a must see musical play.",1336003200,3,321,4.333333333333333
4855371,1,B005OZBXT8,"Oh my goodness, this play was the worst stage play I have ever seen in my whole life!!!!! I am so mad that I even wasted my money on it! I think that initially the idea behind it was good and it had potential to be amazing but it was not executed well at ALL!  This play was waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long!  The DVD cover in confusing because the main character IS NOT Robin Givens it's Demetria McKinney's character.  This play was so bad I don't even have words to describe how bad it was.  Me, my best friend, Pastor and first lady watched this play and they banned me from picking out movies because it was so horrible.  Don't waste your money.  Youtube it before you waste your money. It probably isn't on Youtube, though because it is so ridiculously terrible! Horrible! No good!!!!",1334188800,,790,4.451388888888889
4855372,5,B005OZBXT8,The singing in it is very good and the story had a very good message in it. Angela Winbush and Tony Grant are awesome singers.,1330819200,2,126,4.08
4855373,2,B005OZBXT8,"""...at around two hours and ten minutes long, this show could've been edited down to about an hour and a half, and it still would've been alright."" -Lance; Cruciflicks Co-Founder

""...I should warn you that this is not a film for everyone. It has some very edgy content that will offend many of its viewers....However, all in all, the material was used in a way that drove home the main message the characters were trying to convey. Which was, to put it simply, no matter how far from God you stray, He's always waiting with open arms to welcome you back."" -Mary; Cruciflicks Co-Founder

4855374,1,B005OZBXT8,"This is one of the worst plays that I have had the displeasure of viewing.  The whole point of the script was good but the singing drags on forever and the songs are entirely too long causing the viewer to lose interest.  I must admit I fast forwarded through most of the songs because they were too looooooong.  The acting was mediocre and amateurish and I still don't know why Robin ""I can't act my way out of a paper bag"" Givens was even in the play,her role was pointless!  Robin Givens career must really be in the toilet as she has not acted in any movies worth mentioning in quite some time. Stage plays must be her only means of support now because she as well as Vivica Fox have both resorted to doing mostly stage plays.  The only highlight to this movie was Angela Winbush singing her hit song Angel but other than that her role as the mother was unrealistic.  I am glad that I only spent 11.00 to order this movie and I will NOT recommend this one to friends and family. I wish that I had waited to rent it from Blockbuster for 3.00 and I could have saved 8.00.  The producer of this play needs to hone her craft and concentrate on stage plays that are not so long and grueling when it comes to the songs.  People do not want to have to sit through 5 to 7 minutes of singing in one song!",1329091200,9,1299,4.147410358565737
4855375,5,B005OZBXT8,"This is an work of art by one of the most prolific play writes of our time. Period. This play is a well orchestrated symphony because it's life, it's love, it's truth, it's deception, it's explosive, it's real, it's comedy, it's tragedy, and lastly best of all it's redemption. Most importantly, it's not that same 'ole boring and predictable story-line that caters to only women but there is something to glean for everyone. Look at the cast..Everything that you need to tell the powerful true-life story is here. Great Job!! A+++",1327968000,5,531,4.846153846153846
