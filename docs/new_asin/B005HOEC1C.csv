8473345,1,B005HOEC1C,I really wanted to like this movie but right from the start it was boring. I watched it hoping it would get better but it never did. The best part of House Of Women was the end & I'm not trying to be funny. The final riot & hostage situation was the only time I woke up & started to get into it. By then I think there was only like 5-10 minutes left so that should tell you how much I thought of this movie. Zzzzzz.......,1432080000,,421,3.8505747126436782
8473346,5,B005HOEC1C,"House Of Women is fun! Barbara Nichols does well in her role as a flashy blonde, refusing to accept parole. Jeanne Cooper who plays Katherine on The Young And The Restless is a guard. Constance Ford is also good as usual in a sad role. Not as searing as Caged but a pretty good entry in this genre.",1333152000,3,298,4.155172413793103
8473347,2,B005HOEC1C,"Comparisons to 1950's ""Caged"" are inevitable, but 1962's ""House of Women"" brings nothing new or exciting to Women-in-Prison films. In fact, it's the first boring entry I've seen in the genre.

Lead actress/inmate Shirley Knight arrives kicking and screaming in the opening scene and we learn she's five months pregnant. A few scenes later, she has a daughter who's about to turn three and be removed from the prison. The film's timeline is not made clear by the script. The big question is whether or not Knight will get paroled in time to reclaim her daughter on the outside before she's permanently adopted. Her main obstacle is Warden Andrew Duggan. He starts off nasty and bitter, as it turns out his wife ran off with a parolee; but he falls for Knight, which bodes well for her light work detail but not for her future when he doesn't want her to leave.

Barbara Nichols provides the comic relief as a former stripper. We're supposed to feel moved when her character rejects parole because there's nothing for her on the outside, but the character development in this movie isn't too deep, so we the viewer don't feel anything. ""House of Women"" isn't well-written or well-acted enough to be great cinema, and yet it's not over-the-top enough to be a campfest like ""Caged"" or ""The Caretakers"". Instead of a mammoth prison matron stomping on innocent kitties, we do get a toddler falling to his death from a rooftop while the inmates look on in horror.

If you've seen the clip on the Warner Archive site that features future daytime soap battle-axes Constance Ford and Jeanne Cooper (Ada from ""Another World"" and Kay Chancellor from ""Young and the Restless"") slapping each other silly during a riot, you've seen the best part of the movie and don't need to waste your time or money on the rest.

A weak entry in the Women-in-Prison genre, not really worth the time. The remastered widescreen print looks terrific, however, and this being a Made-to-Order DVD, there are no bonus features.",1317513600,2,1992,4.798833819241983
8473348,2,B005HOEC1C,"The Blurb on the back of the box and on the WB website both say that this movie is a remake of the Classic Women's Prison Picture CAGED.

THEY LIED! The only thing that this film has in common with CAGED is that it is set in a women's prison.

WB has some nerve! How does one get a job writing about films that they have never seen! I wonder what it would pay? That shows you how little WB cares about the consumer or its own back catalogue!

CAGED had JOHN CROMWELL directing, VIRGINIA KELLOGG as the screenwriter and Academy Award Nominated performances by Eleanor Parker and Hope Emerson. HOUSE OF WOMEN has nothing on the level of these attributes.

I didn't remember HOUSE OF WOMEN when I ordered it, and that's always a bad sign. About three-quarters of the way through this boring movie, I remembered that, indeed, I had seen it.

What little this film has going for it are performances by some fine actresses from the 1950s & 1960s, notably, Constance Ford, Barbara Nichols, Shirley Knight and Soap Opera Legend Jeanne Cooper. That's not reason enough to spend upwards of $20.00 on this movie. Wait until it comes down to $5.00 or less, and even then, don't say I didn't warn you.",1316390400,2,1188,4.481481481481482
