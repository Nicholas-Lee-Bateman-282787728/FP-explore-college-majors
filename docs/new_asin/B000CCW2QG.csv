8097615,5,B000CCW2QG,"I absolutely loved this film. It is a true gem among films--foreign or domestic. And I absolutely loved Sebastian Perez in the title role as Ivan. He is a beautiful child and a great actor. In the film he plays a boy whose father is returning to his native Chile with his family. (The wife is of European ancestry.) The problem is, Ivan has lived in New York all his life and doesn't want to leave the familiar surroundings he has grown to love. He also doesn't want to leave his friends in New York. But he has to make the best of things, so he says goodbye to New York and he is on a plane to Chile. After their arrival, he still will only speak English out of protest, even though his parents speak Spanish to him. He is also aware that his mother is about to have a baby and he feels that this will cause him to get less attention. There are just too many changes for him to deal with all at once, so as soon as he sees an opportunity, he sneaks out of his apartment and runs away. Thus begins his adventures on the streets of Santiago. For two days his family searches frantically for him, but Ivan is having the time of his life. He is absorbing the urban culture of his new country, and even makes a new friend who has a duck named Patito. But eventually Ivan begins to miss his family and he decides to return home, but with a newfound sense of belonging. One message that comes from this movie is that home can be anywhere if you have family and friends who love you. I hope many people will see this film. It is not a complex film, but it is a very meaningful film about love and family and a feeling of being at home. It is a film that everyone can relate to on some level. For me, just watching the wonderful performance by Sebastian Perez as Ivan was enough to make me love this film. He is nothing short of amazing.",1321056000,,1829,4.126050420168068
8097616,3,B000CCW2QG,"The main idea of the plot has already been discussed in other reviews.

The movie goes back and forth between English in the US and Spanish in Chile. Other than Ivan doesn't want to speak Spanish in Chile. The Spanish subtitles will not work when the actors are speaking Spanish. The Spanish subtitles only work when the actors are speaking English.

If you wanted to show this in a Spanish class or to the family, here are the things to know. There's no violence. There is some kissing. El Flaco goes to a brothel with Ivan, skimpy clothing but no nudity. There's a scene with El Flaco in a bed with a woman, a blanket covers up to the shoulders. There are a some (not a lot, 10-12 roughly) profanities, mostly dealing with the buttocks. El Flaco drinks and Ivan ends up drunk once too. There are some good cultural items brought up, such as the ""Colo Colo"" soccer team, and the Cerro Santa Lucia. Along the cultural lines, there is some use of ""vos."" The ""desaparecidos"" are mentioned more than once. The actors for the most part do speak clearly. Summing it up, probably a better for 3rd-4th year students movie.",1301875200,20,1115,4.514851485148514
8097617,3,B000CCW2QG,"It is a funny story of Chile seen through eyes of a boy-repatriate hanging around a city while his family is looking to his any trace desperately.

In general, I am not impressed much.",1300233600,,184,4.411764705882353
8097618,4,B000CCW2QG,"GRINGUITO is an enchanting film. It tells the story of Ivan, a young boy living in New York City. Ivan is a complex child, both overly mature for his age in some areas but woefully immature in other ways. He can be artistic and precocious one minute and obnoxious and incorrigible the next. He is the son of Chilean parents, the father a native and the mother of European heritage (hence his being called Gringuito). The parents moved to New York at a time of political unrest and decided to return to their homeland prior to the birth of their second child. The move upsets Ivan, as does the impending birth of a new sibling. As a way of protesting his displeasure, he runs away while his babysitter is entertaining her boyfriend soon after moving to Chile, and spends a few days on the streets absorbing urban life.

The writing of the film is skillful to say the least. The story could easily have spun out of control. There is tension between the father and his in-laws, particularly his mother in law, related to ethnic and political differences, yet we understand that while knowing about the tensions is important, they are never the major point of the story. The dangers he faces on the street are seen through his eyes consistently and for the most part do not overtake the plot. In the end, we believe this story could happen, wondering what Ivan will experience next. It is also well acted, especially Sebastian Perez who plays Ivan. The film is heartwarming but not overly sentimental and should be enjoyed by anyone who likes a good story and a bit of adventure too.",1147132800,10,1579,4.599290780141844
