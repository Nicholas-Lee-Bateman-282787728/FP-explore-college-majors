beyond our touristic imaginings. It is presented as the continuation of The Last Kiss (2001), but both films stand on their own.
Don't be intimidated by the necessity to acquire a Multi Region Film adapter.  They are cheap now, and Amazon sells them. A whole new world opens as soon as one buys one of those. Remember, you will not be able to see this film without this adapter!
It comes with English subtitles.",1501286400,,557,4.626262626262626
