No subtitles other than Dutch ones.
Otherwise good quality.",1338595200,,217,5.055555555555555
8409663,3,B003YM80B2,"Poor Detective Inspector Peter Pasoe (Colin Buchanan) is given little to do; it's surprising that Buchanan didn't just walk away, but he was given the chance to direct an episode (did a great job). The wonderful Wieldy is gone. Even the music is of poor quality. What happened? With Series 8, we witness a decline in the show, which is now split into two 45 minute parts, slowing down the pace. Writers and directors experiment with the format, from slow-motion shots, to slow memories being played out. The Yorkshire countryside is almost absent (except for ""Great Escapes""), replaced with dull offices. I've read all of Reginald Hill's wonderful, complex Dalziel & Pascoe mystery novels, and enjoyed the series thus far; I can't help but wonder if Warren Clarke, doing double-duty as actor (Detective Superintendent Inspector Andy Dalziel) and Consultant Producer, was under extreme pressure as to funding, with lack of project support from executives. Reviewers from Amazon U.K., such as I.J. Parnham (Moray, Scotland), reveal that viewers are also disappointed in the sea-change in the Series, as the narrative drifts further away from Reginald Hill's original inspiration.

A Game of Soldiers: David Soul guest-stars as a Boston cop, in an improbable episode that only provides Inspector Peter Pascoe some genealogy research to perform; his role becomes more and more thankless. Dalziel meets up with another old flame, who has secrets, their relationship is the most convincing aspect of this story. Dividing the show into two 45 minute parts is annoying, whatever plot there is loses the previous Series' narrative flow.

The Price of Fame: It's possible to speed through the unbearable teeny-bopper song and dance routines and ""reality show"" nonsense, without missing any of the plot. This nightmarishly bad episode is the worst thus far in the entire Series, with clowns, amusement parks, and loathsome pink jackets. Guest-star James Corden, excellent in ""The Lodger"" of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Complete-Fifth-Series/dp/B003EV6DBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Complete Fifth Series</a>, and ""Closing Time"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Sixth-Series-Part-2/dp/B004QOB8R0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Sixth Series - Part 2</a>, is wasted. The story also indulges in slow-motion shots and memory replays, utterly dull. Thankless for all but Dalziel, the story exploits the very stuff it presumes to condemn.

Great Escapes: The only good episode, it's very well-directed by Colin Buchanan (Pascoe). On a dark and story night, a kilt-wearing Dalziel is stranded on a high moor when his car breaks down. A snarling moor-beast seems to be roaming the crags, while an escaped prisoner seeks to reunite with his daughter. Dalziel finds shelter in a cozy pub, and a room to sleep off his double-shots of single-malt whisky. Thankfully, Buchanan brings out our classic Fat Andy, snoring like a walrus, kilt akimbo, scratching upon waking. Unfortunately, the plot of Part Two descends into unnecessary and improbably ugly deviance.

Soft Touch: A shoe factory is the setting for family intrigue and murder. Poor Andy is threatened with relegation to a desk job. He fights to keep his position, but finds no rest; as he says, insomnia seems to be going around Yorkshire. A serviceable episode in the series, but Pascoe's role seems to be contracting, the city-scape lacks the atmosphere of the previous story, and it's missing the us/them dynamics of Yorkshire life, depicted in earlier seasons.",1335312000,,3649,5.702205882352941
