Or sittting on your knees and putting your fists on your lower belly and bending down. The instructor says its ovary stimulation. So of the moves are not beginner friendly and I'm an absolute beginner. However, with lots of practice I'll be able to balance myself. I would say this dvd is very good for relieving stress during the ttc stage. Its pretty calming and she talks a lot about fertility and is soothing and graceful. Lots of breathing excerises and kegals. Also lots of interesting hip openers. I'm still going to use the dvd. So prepare to feel a silly at times. At one point she lays on her back and shakes her legs fast. A lot of stimulation of circulation is her suggestions. This is great to center yourself and spirtually calm yourself. Like very hippieish but not in bad way. Just at times its weird. If your going to bu this keep open mind and practice the balancing moves in your free time. That way when you use the dvd your able to balance better.",1494460800,2,1117,4.480392156862745
