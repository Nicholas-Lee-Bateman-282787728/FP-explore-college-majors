3691128,1,B001LT412C,"I guess it is my fault for not reading the reviews on this product before I shelled out eleven bucks for it. It might be worth eleven cents but at least it's the only worthless product I have ever bought here at Amazon. It is a complete waste of time and money and I'm only writing this review, my first, to help keep you from wasting yours too.",1236038400,22,345,4.088235294117647
3691129,2,B001LT412C,"The only ""Ultimate"" with this item is the hype. The HD is perhaps 720i at best and the scenes are boring even for screensavers, which is all that you have when you buy this. Man, did I ever waste $14!  I gave it 2 stars just for the cloudy sky time lapse sequence; that one was actually pleasant.

If you want exciting, crisp HD of natural wonders, buy the Planet Earth series or any of the Sunrise Earth offerings in blu ray. Discovery HD does it right - not this amateurish melange of detritus.",1235692800,8,496,4.26595744680851
3691130,1,B001LT412C,This is the most boring video in history. 8 different senes. but no momement. the same senes on a static camera no movement. boring is not a right term. Don't buy for pictues of Italy etc.,1235520000,3,188,4.25
8319698,2,B001LT412C,"If you pay more than a few dollars for this one, you won't be happy.  Save your money and put it towards a series like Planet Earth or something along that line.  Alot of hype for nothing.  That's my opinion, probably since I already have the Planet Earth series.",1279411200,2,263,4.326530612244898

As an HD showcase this DVD is a complete failure.

I have seen clearer, crisper, better defined video as cut-aways on network broadcast series (i.e. CSI)!!

Not only is the video poor, you are subjected to short video loops played over and over and over, etc.  It's a bad thing multiplied.

I am returning the DVD -- not for a refund, but as a demonstration of how bad I think it is  --  it is a deceptive (fraudlent) attempt to lure buyers who enjoy HD TV and would like to see their video equipment perform at its best.

I gave it 1 star only because I had to give it some rating to get to the point where I could enter this review!

If, by any chance, you're not sure about my recomendation fot buying this DVD - DON'T!!",1262649600,,925,5.238095238095238
8319700,1,B001LT412C,World's slooooowist zooms and pans.  Way boring.  Only thing it's good for is to make a small frisbee of the disc and re-use the storage sleeve for something worthwhile.,1261094400,,169,4.793103448275862
8319701,1,B001LT412C,"The title and description of this product is grossly over-estimated. Each video is on a loop with no real changes. Several of the videos were shot at night. This is the wrong video to test out your high-def TV/Projector. I recommend buying a normal movie or one of the ""test disks"".",1253577600,,282,4.549019607843137
8319702,3,B001LT412C,"The images has not been taken in high definition. Visually, we see like an ordinary 720p movie. It seems in some part of the process, that they had used some low definition equipment. The BBC Planet Earth Blu-ray is totally sharp in 1080p.",1247184000,7,239,4.5813953488372094
8319703,5,B001LT412C,This is easily the best Africa visual bluray DVD I have in my collection so far. I bought that first LCD-Plasma DVD and was disappointed by how vanilla it was. This new LCD/Plasma Africa DVD rocks. There's tons of camera movements and different scene locations. My fave was the sunrise and sunset across this pond in one African scene. The new age music on this DVD is good. There's scenes I keep replaying because the music is cool and fits the hi def. scene. Nice bluray DVD for the price!,1241395200,5,491,4.466666666666667
8319704,1,B001LT412C,"This Blu-Ray disc is a waste of time and money, and the description is blatantly false and misleading. This disc does NOTHING to show off an HDTV system, either visually or aurally. The images are nothing more than one-minute film loops of incredibly uninspired scenes, and they are NOT in 1080i. Clarity is terrible, and the sound track is abysmal. Whoever gave this disc 5 stars either works for the company unloading this garbage, or has absolutely no clue about HDTV and surround sound.",1240185600,31,490,4.845238095238095
8319705,1,B001LT412C,"How did this ever get to the disc press? Writing a review is wasting my time but i owe it to anyone else who might be looking for DVD Eye Candy. The long and short. Lousy detail! Boring imagery!. I've seen better VHS detail. Whoever created this should be ashamed of themselves for pawning this junk on those looking to accentuate their HI-def systems. Planet Earth is still the best folks. They use the best equipment and go to the most exotic places to get flawless images. Also, the Pixar animations look great too! That said...OK Pixar, where's ""The Incredibles"" on Blu-ray?",1239148800,16,578,4.676470588235294
8319706,1,B001LT412C,This was such a waste of my money. There are a few commercials on TV that you could tape and create your own movie. It is just scenes that are not original and very boring and the music is awful.,1239062400,,195,3.9
8319707,4,B001LT412C,"I enjoyed the hi def. quality of the 9 different enviroments on this new DVD. I used the fireplace one the other day during a dinner party because it was freezing outside. While in Europe 3 weeks ago on biz my friend had the euro copy of the LCD Africa one and it rocked. That one was more like moving camera shots with amazing scenery and tons of different places. I'll also buy that one. Funny, I really liked the back ground music too...",1237248000,,440,4.25
