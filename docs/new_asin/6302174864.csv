435543,2,6302174864,"I'm not going to lie, I only rented this movie because I was curious about Batista's acting skills. And this is the reason it's getting 2/5 stars.

As far as the storyline goes, it's a pretty typical 'seek and revenge' setting. Movies like this seem to never get old to me though so that was fine. The only thing that completely killed it for me was Batista's acting, he could not get away from his bad-boy wrestling act the ENTIRE movie which is fine for 5 minutes in the ring but dragging it out for an hour and a half was dreadful. He was dull, emotionless, ""too cool for school"", and looked like he was staring at a wall in his dialogue - it never changed not once and it got old.

If they would've gone with a different actor for the main character this movie would've had great potential, but they didn't so *insert fart noise here*.",1311120000,,839,4.30379746835443
435544,3,6302174864,"Without a doubt Dave Bautista has an amazing screen presence and proves here he can carry a film without having to shoot his way through it or by beating up tons of bad guys (as surprisingly he hardly does anything physical in this entire film).

Story follows a former cop that served time for being on the take and now does private security for a high end illegal club. Things go from bad to worse for him as he has to figure out who robbed the club and try to prove to everyone he is actually a good person now. The filmmakers really tried to go the artistic way with this one, including well over 15 minutes of filming Bautista driving through the cold city, chain-smoking and walking the streets (I finally timed it because it became apparent they were needing filler for the actual 60 minutes of story). Amy Smart plays the love interest, but the ""R"" rating comes strictly from the strippers in the club. Danny Trejo has a few lines but it is always fun to watch him. The special features:

* Making of, 9 minutes. Some brief insights spliced into too much film footage to be that informative.
* Interviews with cast/crew, 4 @ 8 minutes. Longer takes of what was put into the making of docu. The Trejo one was only 90 seconds but he gives that great story of how he got into acting (the story has been told 100 times - but I love hearing it again anyway).
* Commentary with director and Bautista. I did listen to it but will mention why at the end here.

5.1 English with subs in Spanish and English. Region 1 coded. The artwork is deceiving as he never carries a gun in the film though he uses one once or twice in self defense. The action is sparse, especially with Bautista so if you are looking for that skip this film; even more frustrating is he continually gets beat down and shoved around while never really handing out any great fighting. This is a solid showing for him on an acting front, but the writing is horrible and that ending is so bad I turned on the commentary to find out why they made it that way - and they did not have any real explanation. Tough investment of time without the fast-forward button and by far the worst ending I have seen with any of these fighter-turned-actor films.",1310947200,4,2213,4.353510895883777
435545,3,6302174864,"""You find the men who murdered my son and bring them to me.""  After the club he works at gets robbed on his watch ex-cop Ray (Bautista) is told by the owners that it is up to him to find and retrieve the money and get the man who killed the owners son.  When the clues he follows leads him to question everything he wonders who's side he is really working for.  This movie surprised me a little.  The main reason is that nine times out of ten movies with wrestlers as the main star are not that exciting.  They seem fun and good for the first twenty minutes then really drag and become repetitive. This one is the opposite.  The last twenty minutes in this one are good, the build up to them is a little slow.  For a B-rate action movie starring a wrestler I have actually seen much worse.  This is not a great movie, but it was much better then I expected it to be. I did feel that the fighting could have been better, being that Bautista is the lead actor. Overall, not a bad movie.  Better then I expected. I give it a B-.

Would I watch again? - I don't think I will.

435546,1,6302174864,"Filmed in the Hollywood Hills area and environs, this movie tells of an adventure occurring to Janet (Jamie Barrett), a young and appealing reporter for an unidentified Los Angeles region newspaper, and how journalistic ambition causes her to go too far. The plot includes an unplanned meeting between Janet and Corey (Tawny Moyer), a highly-paid lady of the evening, and a conversation with her recently acquired friend leads Janet to attempt creating a major feature article under her byline. This low-budget production calls for the young reporter to work undercover as a prostitute in a house under the aegis of Louis (Frank Annese) and, while in preparation for her new ""assignment"" she discovers evidence of murder and blackmail. Although apparently physically attracted to Louis, who is training her for a premiering stint as a scarlet woman, Janet quickly becomes aware that her new employer is not reticent about eliminating troublesome subordinates. When Louis and his henchman Frankie (James Daughton) begin to suspect the tyro hooker's motives for her fresh career choice, Janet realizes that she must work to not only obtain information, but to survive, as well. One sees here a storyline not terribly different from many others of its ilk and in itself not without interest, but the amateurish direction and generally shoddy production values leave the engaged artists open to carping. There is precious little character development, a point of view is missing as is needed editing, and some scenes are excruciating to watch due to erratic pacing by the director in his initial feature.",1147737600,,1600,5.229571984435798

Plot is at times holey enough to be incomprehensible, with more than a couple of ""how did they know to do that?  did the character have a copy of the script?  hey, is that the script there, in the scene?"" moments.  Not terribly mysterious mystery.  Lots of violence, lots of naughty words.  Weirdly bad audio (ADR, folks?) in spots, can't quite figure out why.  Typical contemporary shaky cam in lieu of cinematography.  Reuse of secondary footage a little amusing; one shot of a church in what I assume is Grand Rapids, in the crook of a highway, appears over . . . and over . . . and over . . . and over . . .  Ending oddly ambiguous, nihilistic.  Dark is good, right?  No . . . not necessarily.

If you're really, really in the mood for an action crime spree, as I was at the start of the film, you will stop being in that mood about an hour in.

435813,1,6302174864,"Remember when people used to say that no other movie starring a wrestler could ever be as bad as ""The Marine""? Well, show them this dreck and they'll eat their words.

""The Marine"" was an absolute catastrophe but it looks like the work of God compared to this. I have to admit, though, that the badness in this movie is pretty fascinating. Who'd thought that a 300-pound wrestler with muscles the size of a bowling ball could run like a sissy and be outmatched by someone half his size? How amazing is it that in a scene where Batista wants another file from his partner that the most powerful bits of dialogue they can deliver are F-words like a 13-year old? It also intrigues me how Batista could beat up a black accomplice, take him with him in his car and then the black dude then just disappears for the rest of the movie. And wait a minute, Batista suddenly has another car? What did he do with the first car? How did he get the second car?

There's a plot going on about an ex-con is caught in the middle of a crime that he did not commit but the movie is so incompetently directed that it'd be more pleasurable to decipher the way it was made rather than the story it tells. One of my favorite scenes is when someone shoots a guy a few times with a silencer and then the scene cuts to the person standing there for a split second before he is gunned down. A few seconds later, the shooter puts the gun over the person's head and shoots him but in the next shot, it is shown that he actually shot him IN THE LEG!

In a movie this horrible, you would think the action scenes would be entertaining, right? Wrong. The action scenes have as much excitement as being stranded in a traffic jam...and possibly just as painful. Even more painful is seeing a 300-pound wrestler get his a-- whipped by people half his size. This guy could do spinebusters, bench presses and powerbombs in the ring and yet in this movie, he cannot take down one dude in a trailer?!!!

Action movies should provide visceral pleasure for audiences but ""House of the Rising Sun"" is a rarity: an anti-action action movie, one where even the most enjoyably dubious qualities are greatly missed. If you have the ability to think for yourself, avoid this like a plague. Turn on RAW if you want some action. Hell, you might even find a better storyline there.

THERE WERE TOO MANY BAD CHARACTERS MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO KEEP THEM SEPERATED AND MOST OF THEM WERE ELEMINATED BEFORE THEY HAD AN OPPOTUNITY TO DEVELOP THEIR ROLE.,1330473600,,431,4.512820512820513
435838,3,6302174864,"I asked for this movie for Christmas because I am a big fan of Dave Bautista. Granted, I had never watched this movie before until today, and despite me liking this man as a wrestler, I must admit that his acting skills are quite a lot better than I was anticipating, which is good as well as a bit surprising. I felt that he and the other actors in this film did a good job and that it was well shot overall.

To me, the story was a tad typical for the usual action/thriller flick, and I actually found it to be rather confusing at times. It's one of those things that I'll just have to end up watching again, I guess. (And I will at some point; I definitely have no problem with that.) In all honesty, I was expecting this particular movie to be a flat out bomb, but it wasn't all that bad, thankfully. Of course, it wasn't that great, either. I was a little disappointed on how some scenes could intently draw you in and then literally five seconds later, you'll wind up laughing at something completely ridiculous that ends up happening. (Way to kill the mood...) I laughed quite a bit during this movie, which probably isn't a good thing. As the movie dragged on though, I will admit that I got pretty involved during certain parts, but the ending absolutely pissed me off. I obviously won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but I wasn't impressed.

However, all in all, it wasn't that bad. Pretty average in general, to say the least. If you were (and still are) a fan of Bautista when he was a part of World Wrestling Entertainment, then strictly for that purpose, I would buy this film. If not, then it would probably be in your best interest to pass on this opportunity. To me, this is kind of like a collector's item, so I am glad that I had received this as a gift in the first place.",1327190400,,1802,4.281524926686217
435839,3,6302174864,"This film has actors that  portrait well but their actions are weak.  It could have been much better, but its a flesh film at best.  If Ray is built like a hulk then use those abilities outside of  body shots.",1323388800,,209,4.15
435840,4,6302174864,"If you like lots of action, fighting, shoot outs, blonds, strippers and true love you will certainly enjoy this THRILLER. The story is GOOD but simple. An ex-con trying to survive, is forced into a ""do or die"" assignment by a mob boss and everyone is double crossing everyone, right up to the end when true love wins out. Strange but true and except for the constant insertion of T&A with lots of shots of the ""beef cake muscle man hero"" to increase sales, the story was sound and the acting was done by accomplished actors from the ""A"" list. I have watched it twice already and felt it was a good purchase.",1317686400,,607,4.380530973451328
435841,4,6302174864,"Caught this on video and, quite honestly, had fairly low expectations because of the wrestler-turned-actor casting.  Turned out to be an enjoyable crime story with plenty of twists.  Bautista was surprising in the lead.  A few bashers here in the reviews but it ain't CHINATOWN, folks.  Watch it and go along for the ride!

My only complaint is they didn't shoot this in New Orleans.  Would have added to the look and feel of the film.",1311897600,,435,4.657894736842105
435842,3,6302174864,"Judge Dan Mancini, DVD Verdict-- You have to give director Brian A. Miller credit for trying to shape House of the Rising Sun into a bleak neo-noir thriller instead of the sort of explosive, combat-heavy action-adventure typical of the feature film debuts of most professional wrestlers. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't come close to delivering on its genre promises. Dave Bautista is surprisingly good as Ray, a role that gives him plenty of opportunity to play fear and anxiety while shying away from the sort of blunt force trauma we'd expect from a guy his size and with his background making the leap onto the silver screen (in fact, his one major fist fight in the movie is utterly implausible because of how capably the other actor fights back despite being about half Bautista's size). But the fledgling actor's solid line reads and emotive facial expressions don't quite make him appropriate for a role that, in the noir tradition, cries out for a regular schmoe with whom the audience can relate when fate begins to grind him between a rock and a hard place.

Moreover, Miller and cinematographer William Eubank lacked the means or expertise to give the movie the visual flair one expects of noir. It's not that the picture should been self-consciously styled like a throwback. Rather, Ray's fear is observed by the camera objectively when one of noir's distinguishing characteristics is a use of framing and lighting that evokes desperation and paranoia for the audience. Nothing about the look of the film places us in Ray's psychological or emotional shoes, and that's too bad because there's just enough going on in Bautista's performance that a more artful visual approach may have improved the movie mightily (matters aren't helped by Miller's inexplicable decision to set the movie in Grand Rapids instead of New Orleans, the location of the real House of the Rising Sun). A more aggressive use of the camera wouldn't have saved the movie from a third act that unravels and fizzles out rather than delivering satisfying, nihilistic climax it attempts, but it would have made our journey with Ray a bit more compelling.

The Blu-ray's 1080p/AVC transfer has the smooth, crisp look of a feature shot on high definition digital video, though depth and detail are mostly weak due to the restrained lighting. The image fails to satisfy because the format wants clean lighting, while the genre demands grit and grain. The transfer is somehow both too clean and too muddy.

The DTS-HD Master Audio mix in 5.1 surround is far from immersive, but it competently handles the movie's few bursts of action.

For extras, you get a feature-length commentary by Miller and Bautista, a nine-minute making-of featurette, and brief video interviews with Miller, Bautista, Smart, and Trejo. There's also a trailer for the film.

435843,4,6302174864,"The movie starts out like it is going to be a pretty good grindhouse. Tough guy Dave Bautista, as Ray walks through The Rising Sun, a strip joint in Grand Rapids. It has illegal gambling and prostitution upstairs. Ray is an ex-cop who just got out of jail and works for a guy named ""Vinnie."" While watching the door, some gunmen rob the place and shoot Vinnie's son.

Vinnie wants Ray to use his police abilities to find the guys who killed his son, and bring them to him. As Ray investigates the murder, his suspects die, making it look like he is involved. In fact so many get shot and killed at one point I was laughing. As the police and Vinnie's boys hunt down Ray, Ray must try to solve the crime to a sound track of metal and hip-hop music. The grindhouse aspect of the movie wanes as it becomes an action/drama. Danny Trejo has a small role. In acting Baustista is above Steve Austin and Seagall, but he is no Vin Diesel.

F-bomb, sex, nudity.",1311465600,6,951,4.307262569832402
435844,4,6302174864,"My husband rented this through an online preview site.  I've always liked Amy Smart and decided to watch.  Thought it was a good action flick.  Seems like they needed more of an average Joe guy than a wrestler for the lead.  That and some of the editing and director choices seemed a bit off.  The story itself though was full of twists and surprises.  Overall, worth a watch and we might catch it again one day.",1311206400,7,412,4.355263157894737
