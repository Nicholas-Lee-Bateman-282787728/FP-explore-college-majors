3725031,5,B001O0TWY0,"Season Eight was when two episodes (Ice Queen 8-20 and Meltdown 8-21) included the soon-to-be spun-off NCIS staff.  Gibbs, Ducky, Abby and Tony in addition to Director Morrow (seasons one and two).  There were also two special agents who did not make the NCIS series.

A bit of trivia, Patrick Labyorteaux and Mark Harmon both starred in Summer School in 1987.  A classic film that can be enjoyed by all.",1236470400,73,404,4.728571428571429
3725032,5,B001O0TWY0,"I could never watch this when on TV as I worked an off shift, but now that I'm retired I've bought every series the minute they have it available.
This is tops, but then what else would you expect from
Mr. Bellisario???
Whenever I get the latest series I can't help but have a marathon watching session, these are so good.
If you like police procedurals, mystery and military stuff, this is the one for you. Even better than 5 stars!!!!!",1235088000,12,437,4.407407407407407
3725033,5,B001O0TWY0,"As a retired personnel from the Navy, I find the show to be very true.
From the salutes to action onboard Naval warships, it was almost being back in the Navy.
I did not watch the show while on TV but I watch/record reruns on USA network at 0800, Mon-Fri...I first saw the show on USA 2 yrs ago and was caught hook, line and sinker ever since...You can also see reruns on the Sleuth channel early an mid mornings.
Great show, I have Seasons 1-7 and will pickup Season 8 when it becomes available.",1233792000,29,496,4.231578947368421
3725034,5,B001O0TWY0,"I was lucky enough to catch the first few episodes of Jag was became totally hooked.  The depth of the characters
and their interaction was fanomominal! ! !If any network
wanted to cash in they should try to put this show back
together with the original characters.  I watched every episode and never got enough.  It would be great to see
Harm & Mac finally married & carry it on from there. The subtle looks, body language & total loyality of the cast to each other was awesomely done and very realistic.  I loved every episode for a different reason.  It was the
""BEST OF THE BEST' when it comes to T.V. shows.",1232841600,32,612,4.380530973451328
3725035,5,B001O0TWY0,"The show is so addicting and well made it became my favorite show in no time. Catherine Bell is gorgeous!
I even named my first born after David James Elliotts character and named him Harmon! Cool and unique name.
If you want accurate, exciting, and a nail biting show, this is it.
They even had a NAVY liason working with them to ensure accuracy.
Trust me. Buy it and all other seasons.",1231545600,12,387,4.388888888888889
3725036,5,B001O0TWY0,"I'm watching these on home TV recorded copies on VHS...fast forward past commercials. Still enjoying it and look forward to getting the DVD copies.

I didn't watch Jag until it was in the 10th season. Recently I caught it on TV reruns and got totally hooked. I had to get the DVD's. Needless to say I LOVE Harm Rabb, he couldn't be any cuter. Season two brought Catherine Bell on the scene as Harm's Partner. I love the immediate chemistry between them and the looks Harm gives her...my heart swoons. The love is there for sure now but they cannot act on it.

I didn't think it would keep getting better and better but what can I say it does. Season 8 is no dissapointment. I love how it is current with the year it was made as far as what wars are going on.

I think watching this also makes us remember our troops more and all they are doing for us. We can sit and enjoy watching DVD's safe in our homes because they are protecting and defending our freedom.

The adventures are so varied and different in each show. Season two has more courtroom time it's investigations and drama.

I cannot say enough good about this show. You will not be disappointed.",1231286400,14,1157,4.362790697674418

3725042,4,B001O0TWY0,"Having seen the series a few years back it was enjoyable watching the 8th series. It was a simple task for me to understand all the ongoing stories within each episode, merely because I had previously viewed when it came on TV. The main reason I bought this series was the ""pilot"" for NCIS, a series I truly enjoy and have collected all DVD releases. However the JAG stories were also entertaining, and now I must see if I can resist the temptation to purchase series 9, after the series end storey for 8.",1489449600,2,505,4.382978723404255

BUT, if you want to get to the NCIS pilot (Show I love by the way), you pretty much have to get this DVD.

At Christmas these two also get some good news.
The Harm and Mac thing continues to bounce back and forth, as we knew it would.
Lt. Singer continues to make us dislike her - A LOT, and then leaves the series, while new lawyer Tracy Manetti enters.
As usual there are many great story lines, plenty of drama and lost of laughs.

And while I lost interest in the show by the end of the run, I did like when they introduced NCIS in season 8.  Something about the character Mark Harmon played made me interested.  The season itself was good as you can tell the tension was building to an end.  Overall, I felt the writing was smart, and the episodes were believable.  I enjoy watching these, especially now that I travel so much.  Its nice just to rerun episodes and challenge myself on how I might have written the character/plot differently.

3725234,5,B001O0TWY0,"JAG from start to finish was a phenomenal series about the operations of the Judge Advocate General's operations and fulfilment of the legal system that serves our active duty military personell. The character development during this series 10 year run went above and beyond any series I had seen before. This is a series that if one of the networks decided to bring back today would surely have another successful run. The chemistry between the 2 main characters Harmon Rabb and Sarah MacKenzie along with the other characters in the show made this the great series that still continues to be shown on some cable networks. Season 8 would be the season that launched the currently number one hit series currently on CBS the extremely popular NCIS with Mark Harmon from the same producers and which this fall will debut it's 10th season and doesn't show any sign of slowing down. It was amazing that when JAG originally started out on NBC, it was dropped after the 1st season to be picked up by CBS, a decision that I'm sure the executives at NBC have regretted with the long successful run of JAG and subsequently NCIS and it's spin-off NCIS LA. If CBS or another network ever consider putting JAG together again with the same characters and actors they would have to wait for Catherine Bell to be available since she is in another successful series on cable Army Wives. Anyway, If you've never seen any of JAG, and you like series like Law and Order, you'd definitely like JAG. I highly recommend JAG. IF you like NCIS you should really like JAG. I have purchased both JAG and NCIS from Amazon and will most likely at a future point purchase NCIS LA as well - all top notch TV viewing.",1341100800,2,1686,4.604651162790698

3725237,4,B001O0TWY0,".....bought it for the 2 shows with NCIS in them. I was a JAG fan in the beginning of the series, but by season 4,they started getting ridiculous, so never saw those 2 NCIS episodes (season 8, Ice Queen) the first time around. Can't speak for the rest of the season since I didn't watch any of them, but LOVED those 2 prequels to NCIS, so for that fact alone,I was very happy with this DVD set. Had to order it throough amazon because no stores around here had season 8 - everyone must be doing the same thing I am, looking for those 2 shows!  So I was happy with the product, got what I expected, and as usual, everything with Amazon went great, got it sooner than they projected. I'm guessing that if you're a die-hard JAG fan that watched all 9 seasons, you'll enjoy this. If you're an NCIS fan, you'll definitely enjoy it, seeing Gibbs,Tony,Abby and Ducky (and Agent Blackadder,whom I am very glad got sent back to the FBI) in the beginning.",1327968000,3,945,4.338983050847458

3725252,4,B001O0TWY0,One of the few TV series that holds my interest and has a cast that melds well.  Most of the newer shows may be OK but not worth my money to own.,1295913600,,145,3.53125

3725256,5,B001O0TWY0,"Five stars to the series is easy to explain. I simply love to be in a company of good, honest, honorable people. People with principles and loyalty. Call me old-fashioned, a romantic, whatever. I like seeing good folks being defended not just for the career and money reasons but because somebody actually believes they are good, I like seeing bad people being punished. I know this is not a reality. Still like it. It must be a sad world around if to experience a bit of normality, you have to watch series about Navy lawyers :)",1274659200,,529,4.520833333333333
3725257,5,B001O0TWY0,"As a former Navy man, I have enjoyed this series very much.  However, I doubt that in today's navy I could enjoy the camaradery of yesteryear, due to the presence of women in the service.
  The series presents both Marines and Navy as very professional, with much saluting and polite conversation between men and women.
  My Navy, between 1939 and 1960, was less demanding in regards to the ""daily"" routine.  We observed protocol, as required, but not to the extent of that which is portrayed in the JAG series.
  Overall, the Navy was very educational and I'm thankful for my present retired status.
  One thing the series has revealed to me is the dedication and commitment of the U.S. Marine Corps.",1271289600,,701,4.7190082644628095

I love ordering from Amazon.com because I know when I do that the service will be top notch. When I received my order (delivery service also excellent and FAST) it was exactly as portrayed and the quality of each DVD I have viewed so far could not be better.

I highly recommend both JAG DVDs and Amazon.com!!",1268784000,,563,4.30188679245283
3725261,5,B001O0TWY0,"JAG is my second favorite TV series of all time, second only to Magnum PI, which I also have on DVD of course. Every episode from the first, is very interesting, and keeps you interested. I love the cast, the characters are all highly likable with the excption of a Lt Singer, what a self-centered witch! I only wish the series were 20 seasons instead of just ten, and I'd love to see Harm & Mac get together in a relationship. These DVDs are worth every penny and then some. Worth their weight in gold in my opinion.",1265500800,,517,4.285714285714286

3725269,5,B001O0TWY0,"We were fans of JAG after it went from NBC to CBS, and have bought every season the day it was released.  Our family watches several episodes at a time. Patrick Labyorteaux (Lt. Bud Roberts) was excellent this season as he rehabbed and return to JAG.  Lots of guest stars this season including Dean Stockwell as the new Sec Nav, Terry Quinn (Lost) to name a few. Can smell Admiral Chegwiddon's upcoming departure {what a loss). Our favorite episodes from this season included ""ALL YE FAITHFUL"", ""HEART AND SOUL"", and ""EMPTY QUIVER"".  Would love to see some more to the box set, IE: director/producer/actors comments, more behind the scenes, etc. like JAG season One had.  GO NAVY!!!!!!",1242777600,2,685,4.829059829059829
3725270,5,B001O0TWY0,Always loved this show.  The ongoing unromance with Harm and Mac is great to watch. The storylines are believable and you want to care for all the main characters.  Anyone know when the release of season 9 is?,1242000000,,209,4.473684210526316

3725284,5,B001O0TWY0,"As prior military I enjoy this season as I have enjoyed the previous seasons of JAG.  The interaction of members of the cast works very well.  It is heartwarming to see a program that shows respect and dignity for those of us who either were or are in the military, serving the greatest nation on earth, THE UNITED STATEES OF AMERICA.  I contributed to the freedom we all enjoy.  And I am supremely sad and yet grateful to my brothers and sisters who gave the ultimate sacrifice to maintain this great nation.  The cost of freedom is the willingness to offer the loss of life in fighting for freedom. We all owe so much to them.

With the chemistry between David James Elliott and Catherine Bell (Army Wives), the naval cases, the courtroom drama, the action, and the adventures, JAG always flew under the radar. If you have not seen JAG, watch it and you will understand why JAG has such an immense following.
