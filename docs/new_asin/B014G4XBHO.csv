8730650,3,B014G4XBHO,"It's OK if you have nothing else to watch.  Although the actors tried their best, the plot was so slim and thin, I kept checking my watch to see how much longer I had to wait till the end.  Priyanka's performance made me wonder how she keeps getting work.  Ugh.",1447372800,,261,4.18
8730651,4,B014G4XBHO,"The Mehras are messed up in a very Indian way even when there are dark moments such as infidelity by the patriarch, Kamal Mehra ( Anil Kapoor) you don't care. However he has other things to worry about, a self made billionaire his empire is ready to implode but for rich people appearances do matter and even though the expense of taking a cruise with his closest family and friends on the Mediterranean is prohibitive. He may look rich but everything in his life is just very messed up - his marriage to Neelam( Shefali Shah), his strained relationship with his kids, Ayesha and Kabir (Priyanka Chopra, Ranveer Singh)
A flawed and hollow script would have been mediocre on paper but in the hands of the extremely talented Zoya Akhtar as the director, Reema Kagti as the script writer and Farhan Akhtar as he dialogue writer, this drama about a dysfunctional family taking a vacation is actually worth a watch.
There are plenty of moments, funny, tragic and sad to make you savor this cruise. The locales also add a layer of beauty.  The only thing that does not work is the voice over by the family dog, Pluto by Aamir Khan. The character development of Ranveer Singh and Anushka Sharma does not work as well also. But there is plenty of like and things are enjoyable most of the time including the gawk worthy Priyanka Chopra and her train wreck marriage- the best part of the film. Anil Kapoor steals the show but the other characters including the amazing locations make this cruise extremely enjoyable.
The music does not work very well which is disappointing because Shankar Ehsaan and LOy are always dependable. The song that is enjoyed the most was Gallan Goodiyan, which sounded so much like Slow motion Angreza.
The ending was stereotypical but that is what happens when a soap opera ends, but this movie works because it's eye candy about the rich that is delicious. Release date: June 4th, 2015",1445299200,3,1906,4.6895522388059705
