different sources like bootlegs which I had for years and on the KISS set they released years ago but I found the quality on the bootlegs
better than the quality on the official release. The cover on this shows Simmons in his Love Gun outfit which is WRONG! This show is
from Destroyer/Rock and Roll Over Tour and he still wore his armor and dragon boots outfit. but if you don't have a copy it's worth having.",1455494400,,545,4.102803738317757
8290583,5,B001D051OG,"This DVD was listed as a region 1 which might not play on US made players. I took a chance and what do you know, it plays on my US player. Im glad it does, excellent picture and HI-FI sound. This 1988 shows are hard to find live and makes this DVD extra special. The DVD is also pressed on actual silver disc, not on a cheap DVD-R. The service was excellent as well, received it fast. Well done overall.",1418342400,,403,4.05
