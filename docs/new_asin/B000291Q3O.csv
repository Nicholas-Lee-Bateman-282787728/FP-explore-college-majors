In addition to showcasing two very talented comedic actresses, ""Laverne & Shirley"" also had one of the catchiest theme songs on television.

""Laverne & Shirley"" was one of the most watched television programs of the 70's. Originally a spin-off from the hit show ""Happy Days"", this situation comedy very quickly found its own feet and tempo.

The praise here goes to the amazing chemistry between stars Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams. In the classic ""old couple"" genre, they played off each other perfectly. Their timing is flawless.

Penny Marshall, now directing feature films, delivered her lines with a sarcastic 1-2 punch of a seasoned professional (due to years of guest appearances and secondary roles on other classic comedies like ""The Odd Couple"" and ""The Bob Newhart Show""). Her phyiscal comedy is also laugh-out-loud funny.

Cindy Williams plays the perfect foil as Shirley. Her timing and retorts with Laverne are on the money.

A strong supporting cast, including Michael McKean (who went on to star in ""This Is Spinal Tap"") and David Lander as the greasey and lovable Lenny and Squiggy, really give this show some depth.

This boxed set of the complete first season will make a great addition to your DVD library.",1092355200,40,1780,4.723127035830619

2069224,4,B000291Q3O,"Or maybe it was the writer's trying to find theirs..  The episode writing in the first season is rather weak compared to what's on offer in Season 2, and fortunately I'd started with Season 2 and then went back to this first season.  Lucky for me.  I kind of doubt I would have bothered picking up the second season had I seen Season 1 first.  Most of the episodes lack a lot of the clever script writing that was more pervasive in Season 2.  Season 1 is still watchable if you like hanging out with the girls, but doesn't contain nearly the laugh factor of the following season, which has a lot of great episodes.  I've still gone ahead and purchased Seasons 3 and 4, but I wouldn't recommend this first one to those new to L & S.",1316563200,,731,4.223021582733813

I was kind of surprised that there were only 15 episodes in season one.  And each episode is only around 20 to 25 minutes.  Hopefully the other seasons have more episodes. I paid more for this than I did for season one of the Waltons, and there are many more episodes for the Waltons season one, and they are hour episodes.  I have to say though, if you want a good laugh, watch Laverne and Shirley!",1311465600,2,566,4.109090909090909

The 1970s were at all not the easiest time to live through, but at least Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley gave people a return to the days of Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis on the Radio as well as Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennit on the Radio. THese Girls with thier clean cut comedy and outstanding love for one another as best friends is rare today, for there were no bad words or sexual prefference in the open.

Not in the way Rhoda 'spun off' Mary or The Jeffersons 'spun off' All In The family, whose  characters were part of those shows' success for many seasons. Laverne and Shirley were merely introduced on Happy Days probably to test the waters before embarking on their mid-season run. And what a run it was! Chock full of lively, colorful characters, this company had us entertained for several seasons. Lenny and Squiggy gave hilarious support to the show but they never upstaged the cast the way the Fonz did on Happy Days. Still, I was always partial to Laverne even when she appeared on the Odd Couple and a couple of appearances on the Mary Tyler Moore Show.

2069262,5,B000291Q3O,"At 26, the most I remembered of Laverne & Shirley was the reruns I occasionally caught throughout my childhood. Then, the Season 1 DVD came out, and looking for something new to watch, I picked it up. I was hooked!

The general premise surrounds Laverne and Shirley, two twenty-something childhood friends sharing an apartment and working together at the Shotz Brewery in early 1960s Milwaukee. As if the two opposites weren't capable of getting into enough trouble on their own, they've got Laverne's widowed father Frank - owner of the Pizza Bowl, their friends' chief hangout - and loser greasers Lenny and Squiggy around to stir up some more.

Shirley's on-again, off-again boyfriend, Carmine ""The Big Ragoo"" Ragusa is also a steady presence, ready to lend a hand whenever the girls need him.

Much like ""Happy Days"" - of which this show is a spin-off - the storylines are largely simple, revolving around misunderstandings between Laverne and Shirley, or wacky escapades they find themselves in during the course of regular daily life. Nonetheless, the strong friendship between the two, as well as the promise that things will turn out okay in the end as long as everyone wants them to, are appeal enough to a 21st century audience.

2069264,4,B000291Q3O,"It's a simple matter of mathematics.  Season one is a HALF SEASON (15 or so shows).  The cost of this half season is listed at $35.  It stands to reason a full season would cost $70.  Would you pay that for season 2???

OK, now the reason the show is so expensive.  Music COPYRIGHTS.  Each song used as background music on the show has a separate copyright.  Satisfying the holders of these copyrights is expensive.  So the cost is passed on to the consumer.  Same story with Happy Days.  And did you notice no WKRP?  Any show that uses Top 40 music has this problem.  I recently purchased ""Love at First Bite"" with George Hamilton, to find ""I Love the Night Life"" by Alicia Bridges REPLACED by another generic tune.  I guess she wanted too much money. For L&V to do this would spoil the flavor of the show.",1160611200,15,807,4.328859060402684
2069265,5,B000291Q3O,"In my opinion Laverne and Shirley is an example of a ""spin-off"" that's actually better than the series from which it came! No offense to Happy Days, which did EVENTUALLY become a great series, but Lavern and Shirley was quite good from the very first episode.

The wonderful chemistry between Cindy Williams and Penny Marshall helps to lift the program up and above the ussual ""first season FOG"" that most TV series experience. David Lander (Andrew 'Squiggy' Squiggmann) and Michael McKean (Leonard 'Lenny' Kosnowski) were also a great addition to the series. Lenny and Squiggy, the ""two stooges"", will always leave you laughing!

This is a wonderful, light hearted trip back to a more innocent time.

Regarding this DVD box set:

Lavern and Shirley had a good run from 1976 to 1983, eight seasons in all. So where are the OTHER seasons on DVD? Let's take a quick look at how absolutely INEPT Paramount has been in terms of DVD releases. We'll use another classic TV series (Three's Company - which also ran for eight years) for comparison.

* PARAMOUNT released this DVD box set (Laverne and Shirley - season one) on August 17, 2004.
* Anchor BAY released the Three's Company (season two) DVD box on May 4, 2004.

That's a difference of only three months, and yet Anchor Bay will be releasing the eighth and final season of Three's company in OCTOBER of 2006. Anchor Bay managed to release SEVEN SEASONS of Three's Company while Paramount did absolutely NOTHING with Laverne and Shirley. Paramount should be ashamed!!

The transfers are excellent and the series looks very nice on DVD. Let's hope that Season two arrives soon and includes a healthy amount of extras!

UPDATE!!!!!

It looks like SEASON TWO IS FINALLY AVAILABLE and amazon is taking pre-orders!

Ok guys and gals, get your dialing fingers ready. See a few reviews above where ""OceanLover"" lists a phone number for Paramount?? I just called it and was directed to a VERY nice, congenial, friendly lady-boss - yes, I actually spoke to a LIVE PERSON - and asked for info on more seasons of Laverne and Shirley. She actually took the time to go through pages and pages of release dates and re-release dates, but unfortunately couldn't find one for a 2nd season.  What she did for me was, make an entry into the system showing there is interest in L & S. She said ""The 'Powers-that-Be' do check these lists to see what has an interest and make descisions on releasing movies/shows, etc."" And she most certainly said, ""Tell your family, friends, neighbors, who ever loved Laverne and Shirley to call and express their interest. Their calls will be logged onto that list."" So come on cats and kittens, if you loved Laverne and Shirley - not to mention Lenny, Squiggy, Carmine, Frank, Edna, Rosie, Boo-Boo Kitty and many more - CALL THAT NUMBER!! Your opinion will matter, how cool is that! 323-956-5000 ask for Marketing or Home Entertainment.

P.S. If you love quirky, ensemble television shows with characters that will have you laughing 'til it hurts, check out a Canadian show by the name of ""Corner Gas"". Seasons one and two are available. You won't be sorry!!!",1141171200,17,1850,4.516417910447761
2069271,5,B000291Q3O,I have owned the copy of the first season for a long long time.  Why hasn't the second season ever been released?,1139702400,8,113,4.136363636363637
2069272,5,B000291Q3O,"I have been a big fan of Laverne and Shirley since it first aired in 1975. Now, here we are 30 years later, and it still remains one of my all-time favorite sitcoms.  I knew this set had been kicking around for awhile now, but I finally got around to picking it up just last week.  I've now had a chance to watch all three discs and was quite pleased with the quality of the transfers and the sound.  There are no extras included here, no outtakes or deleted scenes, no commentaries or other goodies, but I'm not complaining.  It was, after all, a SITCOM, and that's how they keep the prices on these box-sets low.

The series is set in 1950's Milwaukee, and follows the trials and tribulations of two working class girls from the suburbs, their eccentric but loveable neighbors, ""Lenny & Squiggy""(Micheal McKean and David Lander), and the girls' misfortunes at dating, finding romance, and generally just trying to make their way in the world.  The supporting cast included singer Eddie Mekka(Carmine Ragusa) who played Shirley's occasional boyfriend, Phil Foster(Frank DeFazio), Laverne's loud-mouthed, hard-working Italian father who owns the ""Pizza-Bowl"", and several other guest stars like Henry Winkler and Ron Howard.  Season one DOES NOT include the character of Mrs. Edna Babish, which was played by the charming Betty Garrett, who became the girls' landlord, and later married Laverne's father, Frank. (Betty was still working on All in the Family at the time). It should also be said that the scripts and dialogue here were a little choppy at times, but you have to remember that this was the first season, and the show gradually improved as time went on, which brings me to my complaint...

WHERE IS THE REST OF THE SERIES?  I see the shelves at Wal-Mart lined with other TV shows and sitcoms that weren't half as popular as this one was, and they're up to Season 4 and 5 already...  What is Paramount's problem?  Laverne and Shirley got so much better in later years.  As a matter of fact, season 2 is where things really took off.  Betty Garrett was added to the cast, and we were also introduced to Rosie Greenbaum, one of the girls' enemies from high school who married into money and likes to degrade them by calling them ""bimbos"".  The scripts and the acting became more solid too.  Eddie Mekka was given a number of dance/singing parts, which showcased his talent as not only an actor, but a fine musician as well.  I have many favorite episodes, so many that I couldn't begin to mention them all.  There were also a number of ""two-parters"" that aired such as ""The Cruise"", ""You're In the Army Now"", ""Murder on the Moose-Jaw Express"", ""The Bardwell Caper"", ""Festival"", and ""Death Row"".  On a more somber note, the series seemed to jump the gun after season 5, when the girls packed up their belongings and headed out west to start a new life in California.  Several new cast members were added, such as Leslie Easterbrook(Rhonda Lee), Ed Marinaro(Sonny), and Norman Bartold(Mr. Hildebrand).  The show basically ended when Cindy Williams' character was written off after she married Walter Meeney, an army doctor who was stationed overseas.  Though Penny Marshall tried to hold the show on her own, it was all downhill from there.  The last episode of the series featured Eddie Mekka bidding farewell to the cast as he set off to make a name for himself on Broadway.

Laverne and Shirley ran for 8 years and was one of the highest rated sitcoms of the decade. Critics hated it, but the public adored it. The main audience of the show was middle-class America, who found it easy to relate to.  It also spun off a short-lived cartoon series, and a number of kids toys and collectables.  I don't know when (or if) Paramount will go ahead with season 2, but I'm patiently awaiting their decision.  Several years ago, Columbia House issued a collection of 10 VHS tapes featuring some of the best episodes.  These are now out of print and no longer available, however copies tend to pop up on eBay from time to time.  In conclusion, I would say that this is a welcome addition and a good place to start, but I would like to see the better episodes come out on DVD eventually.  Maybe next year.  We're waiting Paramount...  Until then, enjoy these memories!",1134432000,39,4268,4.703903095558546

2069274,5,B000291Q3O,"Laverne and Shirley was a spinoff from Happy Days from an episode from the 1975-76 season (""So I told her 'Laverne, you have a mouth like a sewer!'  Then she curls up her chubby little fist and goes BAM!""- landing her date Richie on the floor).  Although Happy Days star the Fonz (Henry Winkler) guests on the 1st and 2nd episode, it didn't take long for Laverne and Shirley to develop on their own.  Like Happy Days, Laverne and Shirley took place in Milwaukee, WI, in the late 1950's.  Most of the episodes take place in their apartment, Shotz brewery, or Laverne's father's pizzeria/bowling alley.

Laverne DeFazio (Penny Marshall, who guested on The Odd Couple and Bob Newhart and later director) was the more street-smart one, was sarcastic and irreverent, with a heart of gold behind the rough talk (and of course, had her ""L"" stitched on most of her clothes).  Shirley Feeney (Cindy Williams, who co-starred in American Graffitti and later 8 Simple Rules) was her best friend.  She was basically the sweetheart next door, hypersensitive and moralistic, whose best intentions didn't always work out.  While Shirley dreamed about marrying a Prince Charming, Laverne dreamed more about ""vodeeo-dodo.""  Their shadows and later neighbors are Lenny (Michael McKean, later from Spinal Tap) and Squiggy (David L Lander), 2 lovable greaser-nerds, whom Laverne and Shirley tolerate (""Hallo!""), reminiscent of Dumb and Dumber.  Cindy Williams once shared in a reunion show that their characters were so funny she and Penny Marshall sometimes got jealous that Lenny and Squiggy often got the ""better lines.""  Other regulars included Frank DeFazio (Phil Foster), Laverne's gruff but lovable father and Carmine Ragusa, aka the Great Ragoo (Eddie Mekka), whom would bail Laverne and Shirley out whenever their plans fell through and Shirley had a big crush on (he could do it all- a boxer, a dance instructor and a singer ""You know I'd go from rags to riches!"").

Anyways, you get 15 episodes (this is a 1/2 season, as it was introduced in January of 1976).  Sorry, but no extras (except an afterword with the Fonz at the end of the pilot episode), though the Happy Days episode which introduced them would have been a worthy extra.  The opening episode features Laverne and Shirley being invited to a high society banquet and Lenny and Squiggy ""rent"" them dresses for the occasion.  The Fonz helps organize a bachelor party which Laverne willingly and Shirley reluctantly agree to help out with.  Shirley hosts a high school reunion (Laverne at first doesn't want anything to do with the reunion until a mutual friend, ""Nutsy"" comes to town).  Laverne almost gets married to a sailor whom she only likes but doesn't love (Al Moriano guest stars).  Shirley adopts a bird whom flies out the window (she drives Laverne crazy with her high hopes of the bird coming back- ""Tweet tweet, Shirl!"").  Carmine finds a girlfriend, much to the heartbreak of Shirley.  Lenny and Squiggy rent a room in the same apartment complex, much to the chagrin of Laverne and Shirley.  Shirley gets a job as beer taster, but Mr Shotz, President of Shotz Brewery has ulterior motives.  Laverne is chosen by a policeman she has a crush on to investigate in a stakeout, despite Shirley's objections (the culprit is easily spotted wearing one of Shirley's poodle skirts and one of Laverne's sweaters with the L on it).  A German dry cleaning employee loses his job and Laverne and Shirley do their best to help him.  Mrs. Feeney, Shirley's mother, comes to visit Laverne and Shirley and still treats her little girl like a kid.

2069281,5,B000291Q3O,"I, like many others, have been patiently waiting for the other seasons of L&S for quite sometime now.  In just over 3 months, it will be ONE YEAR since the release of Laverne & Shirley's complete first season, with no further mention of Paramount deciding to go ahead with the rest of the series.  I also agree that I can do without the California episodes, since the show seemed to jump the gun after season 6.  I'm also in agreement that season 5 was perhaps the most refined of the entire series, with good plots and scripts, and solid acting.  ""Murder on the Moose-Jaw Express"" also ranks as one of my all-time favourites, with ""The Diner"" running a close second. ""Betty pick up your hash blacks please"" LOL.

However, with that said, these DVD's are a great beginning.  The transfers are solid, crisp and clear, and the sound is good too.  There are no extras, outtakes, or any other goodies, and even the DVD cases themselves are plain and uninspiring, but that's OK with me since I hardly watch the extra stuff anyway, although some of the outtake scenes would probably be a hoot to watch.  The chemistry between Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams worked magic on the screen, although off camera their relationship was anything but rosey. (they have since reconciled and are good friends today).  Also, season one doesn't include the later character of Mrs. Babish, the girls landlord (played by Betty Garrett) and Rosie Greenbaum, one of the girls arch-enemies.

On the whole, not a bad collection, but certainly not the best.  Perhaps if Paramount doesn't decide to give us any additional seasons, then maybe they could come out with a ""Best of Laverne & Shirley"" DVD, featuring all the better episodes?  Anyway, we just have to be patient and wait and see I guess.  I don't understand why a sitcom that practically saved ABC in the 70's has only had one season released so far.

2069282,5,B000291Q3O,"To me, this show was MUCH better than ""Happy Days""; funnier, not as corny, and with much better performances by the leads. Cindy Williams as Shirley, and Penny Marshall as Laverne, created a classic television comedy that Paramount has finally premiered on DVD!

The show, a mid-season replacement as ""Happy Days"" had been, had a first-season run of 15 episodes ... so here is what the first boxed set should contain:

1) The Society Party - The boss's nephew wants to mingle with the ""commoners"" ... so invites the girls to a dinner at his Nana's manor -- where the girls show up wearing stolen gowns provided by Lenny and Squiggy, and get busted mid-dinner!

2) The Bachelor Party - With Laverne's father away and the girls managing the Pizza Bowl, L&S show a bad error in judgment when Fonzie talks them into letting a bachelor party go on there after hours.

3) Bowling for Razzberries - A bowling tournament is Laverne's big chance to finally get back at a bowling rival ... but by the night of the contest she falls ill, and is so doped up on medication she can hardly walk.

4) A Nun's Story - An old high school buddy, crazy Anne-Marie, shows up for the reunion as a nun.

5) Father at the Altar - Laverne decides to marry her boyfriend of only two months before the Navy ships him off.

6) Dog Day Blind Dates - Laverne and Shirley unwittingly have blind double dates set up with 2 criminals who plan to heist the bank next to the Pizza Bowl.

7) Once Upon a Rumor - Shirley's stuck zipper (with Squiggy trying to help her) leads to a rumor around the brewery that Shirley is a ""fun date.""

8) One Flew Over Milwaukee - Shirley drives everyone nuts when she loses her pet canary.

9) Dating Slump - Shirley becomes sullen and depressed when Carmine finds a new girlfriend.

""Laverne and Shirley"" was an instant hit, and ran for eight years. The show relied a lot on silly humor and schtick and physical comedy, but could always be guaranteed for a lot of laughs, and remains a TV classic. Thanks so much Paramount, and please don't hesitate on other seasons - the two-parter where they catch a murderer on a train to Moosejaw, Canada (season 5- as mentioned by another viewer) is still the BEST!! (remember- THE COCOA'S POISON!) LOL!",1113696000,12,3026,4.482695810564663
2069283,5,B000291Q3O,I have thoroughly enjoyed the first season of Laverne and Shirley and cannot understand why additional seasons are not being produced on DVD.  The show definitely improved in the subsequent seasons even though I agree with the customer who didn't particularly care for the California installments.  Please bring me SOON some more episodes of those silly girls who made me laugh and reminded me of a simpler and more innocent time.,1113264000,6,430,5.042253521126761
2069284,4,B000291Q3O,"Don't get me wrong, I love Laverne and Shirley.  I was very pleased with this DVD set.  Good transfers and nice sound.  There were no extras, but that's hardly a complaint with me since it helps keep costs down.  My question is when can we expect to see the other 7 seasons?  Laverne & Shirley got better as time went on.  The cast got bigger (Betty Garrett and others) and the scripts and acting became more refined.  Season 5 is STILL the best in my opinion.  I wasn't too fond of the California episodes, but I'd still like to see them again nonetheless. (Welcome to Burbank and the Bardwell Caper).  Are you listening Paramount?  There are other less known, less popular sitcoms that are up to season 5 already.  What's the big hold-up?

Thank-YOU Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams for all the memories.  Now let's see the rest of the series too.",1113177600,6,850,4.5131578947368425
2069285,5,B000291Q3O,"Today's world would only be better if we had comedies like Laverne & Shirley back on the air. We are a far too cynical world as it is (refer to Mr. Smith's review) and having a means of entertainment acted by 2 incredibly talented actors is a rare thing. I fully agree, All in the Family and M*A*S*H* were also stellar shows worthy of 5 stars, but they were just a different means of comedy and entertainment.

This set is truly a long time over due and I hope Paramount doesn't stop here!  This quality of comedy needs to be viewed over and over again!  What a great show this was! And Laverne was on to something - I tried Milk & Pepsi and still drink it today. I wonder how many others do, too.",1109808000,6,697,4.148148148148148

Good for the whole family, even the little ones love it!!",1104278400,4,380,4.434782608695652
2069287,5,B000291Q3O,"When I was 12, Laverne and Shirley was my favorite show!  Never missed an episode and would often write my own episodes for my friends and I to enact.

I always watched the reruns and tried to tape episodes when I could, so when this was released on DVD, I had to have it.

Each episode, for me, anyway, is a trip down memory lane.  But it also showcases the outstanding comedic talents of Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams.  They were as good as Lucy. I spent an evening belly laughing and still pop it in when I have had a rotten day and need a chuckle!

This is a great set for the major fan, but also a good way to introduce the latest generation to this great show!",1101772800,39,670,4.115384615384615

Judging by the reviews here I can see people seem to enjoy this show and thats fine, but FIVE STARS?? All in the Family, Mash, Twilight Zone, and very few others are truly five stars, I think people need to face that. Laverne & Shirley, Soap, Maude and many many spin offs of the 70's are simply and utterly terrible. I wouldn't go so far to say that about L&S, it does have a sort of working class charm but it is and always will be second rate, no make that third. Boo Boo Kitty, indeed.",1099526400,7,640,4.169354838709677
2069289,5,B000291Q3O,"Probably one of the funniest duo's in comedy since Laurel and Hardy or Abbott and Costello. The pairing of Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams was an instant success that won many fans. I have waited a long time for this, and I only hope that Paramount doesn't drop the project after season 1.

The DVD's are nice and clear. Superb transfers and good sound. I was astounded at how clear the picture was. Almost as if these videos were being shown for the first time! I couldn't detect any flaws at all, other than than a few sound glitches now and then, but nothing major.

Please, do us a favour and release all 8 seasons of Laverne and Shirley... I haven't seen some of these episodes in YEARS! My personal opinion is either release the series in its entirety or don't even bother. The whole purpose of these DVD re-issues is for to us to enjoy all those golden memories again right? Then do us a favour Paramount and release EVERY episode that ever aired. TV Land was only airing certain episodes, and then showing them out of sequence. I was not impressed. So please, let us enjoy all these old episodes again, complete and uncut, the way we remember seeing them.

Thank-you Laverne & Shirley for all the laughs!",1099267200,18,1214,4.509090909090909
2069290,5,B000291Q3O,"FINALLY, after a long time waiting, Paramount Home Video is releasing all those great sitcoms we all love and remember, one of my favourites being Laverne and Shirley of course!

These DVD's are long overdue in my opinion.  I was very impressed with the quality of the transfers, and I couldn't help but marvel at the vibrant colours and sharpness of the picture, despite the fact that the master prints are nearly 30 years old...  Colours that I never even noticed on the re-runs come through crisp and clean on the DVD.  The sound, although being mono, is also quite good, but there were times (especially with the music scenes) where the volume peaked a little too high, but no big deal.  All 15 original episodes are here, complete and unedited, the way we remember them.

I sincerely hope that Paramount releases ALL seasons of L&S, and not cheat us out of the later episodes.  One of my all-time favourites, and one which another reviewer all ready mentioned, is ""Murder on the Moose Jaw Express"", which aired in two parts and featured an all-star cast that included Scatman Crothers (always a hoot), Charlene Tilton, Conrad Janis, and several others.  This was basically a spoof of ""Murder on the Orient Express"", but MUCH more funny.  Curiously enough, this particular episode isn't shown anymore, even in the re-runs.  I only hope that Paramount decides to give it to us-if they even release season 5 that is...  I guess time will tell, but PLEASE, don't stop at season one!

Now that we've been given a teaser, let's hope we get the entire series.  L&S is a great reminder of what comedy USED to be like.  Along with ""All In The Family"", ""Happy Days"", ""Mary Tyler Moore"", this show will always by synonymous with the 70's.  Thank-you for the memories-and the laughs.  Keep 'em coming Paramount.  I'll be the first in line!",1099094400,11,1832,4.710691823899371
2069291,4,B000291Q3O,"In this long-running first spinoff of Happy Days,Laverne DeFazio(Penny Marshall) and Shirley Feeney(Cindy Williams) are two Milwaukee bachelorettes sharing an apartment together. On several occasions,some HD characters made guest appearances on Laverne & Shirley. I remember one episode where Henry Winkler as Arthur ""Fonzie"" Fonzarelli on HD guest-starred. Hey,he and the rest of the HD gang are in Milwaukee also. Laverne and Shirley are employees at Shotz Brewery. They placed caps on beer bottles until later in the series,an automatic process took over. Laverne and Shirley had two male friends,Lenny(Eddie Mekka) and Squiggy(David L. Lander). On several occasions,Laverne,Shirley,Lenny and Squiggy would go on double dates together. Laverne's and Shirley's landlady is Edna(Betty Garrett). Previously,Garrett had a recurring role on CBS's All In The Family as Irene Lorenzo. Later in the series,Edna would marry Laverne's father Frank and they'd move to California. This didn't happen until 1980. Laverne always wore shirts and sweaters with her embroidered first initial above her left breast. Laverne and Shirley was an immediate hit. That's great for a spinoff. It's just like AITF's spinoff The Jeffersons. Laverne and Shirley premiered in January 1976 and was cancelled seven years later. Unbelievably,Marshall and Williams did not get along well in real life. There was some real-life chemistry between L&S and AITF. At the time of the L&S premiere,Marshall was married to Rob Reiner who was Michael ""Meathead"" Stivic on AITF. When Reiner guest-hosted NBC's Saturday Night Live in October 1975,Marshall appeared with Reiner in at least one sketch. The couple have been divorced since 1981. Both Marshall and Reiner are two of Hollywood's most legendary film directors. As for the theme song MAKING OUR DREAMS COME TRUE by Charles Fox and Norman Gimbel,it was on hit parade in the summer and fall of 1976,several months after the premiere of L&S. Cyndi Greco performed it and the hit song is a different version than the one heard in the opening and closing montages where Greco's voice is heard also.",1098921600,6,2112,5.403030303030303

Laverne & Shirley, Bob Newhart, Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke were and are my all-time favorite TV shows.  I'm delighted L&S is finally out on DVD (I just hope they don't drop the project like they did the MTM show after one season, the creeps).  These 4 shows were to me truly funny.  I read a lot of the reviews on this set before writing mine.  And if I'd read the words ""moral,"" ""principles"" etc. etc. ad extremely nauseum one more time I would have vomited.  It's like abortion.  I'm against it (with exceptions), but the other people who are also against it are so loathsome, I hate to admit it.  That's how I feel about L&S.  To hell with morals!

The series could always be counted on for belly-laughs, without resorting to crude humor that is all to common on television today.  L&S indeed was a spin-off from Happy Days (Richie and Potsie or Ralph (it doesnt matter) went on a double date with L&S), but did you know that Happy Days was also a spin-off??

After taking a day to watch all three DVD's in a row, I thought that there were extra little bits of footage here and there.  I could recite episodes from TV before, but there was a little add in on occassion.  It's just good old TV that you just can't find anymore.

It just seems like there are missing lines of dialogue here and there; wasn't that multi-colored ""dissolve"" (or whatever the term is) technique for switching scenes added to bridge the editing for M-F daytime airings on ABC back in the early 80's?

2069302,4,B000291Q3O,"At long last, ""Laverne & Shirley"" finally comes to DVD. This series was one of the most consistantly funny shows on television in the 70's. Cindy Williams and Penny Marshall share a chemistry that hasn't been seen in a female comedy duo since Lucille Ball and Vivian Vance in ""I Love Lucy"" in the 50's (to which they've often been compared). The two leads work off each other with impecable comedic timing and although their ""notorious"" feuding became the stuff of tabloid headlines, that didn't happen until later in the series.
  Season one shows the girls with a slightly ""rough around the edges"" type style......something that softened as the series went on. It also introduces several quirks that became trademarks of the series......BooBoo Kitty, milk and pepsi, the letter ""L"" on all of Laverne's shirts.
  The DVD set presents the series in a remarkably clear and sharp picture. Perhaps I've been watching the show in syndication for to long but I was greatly impressed with the clarity and sharpness of the picture quality. I noticed the improved clarity right from the opening credits. It was like I was watching it again for the first time. Alas...........there are absolutely no extras (unless you count a preview of the second episode coming at the end of the first episode and ""extra""). Perhaps Paramount didn't want to spend a lot of money on a DVD package they weren't sure would sell well. Well, hopefully ""Laverne & Shirley, Season One"" will sell well enough for Paramount to include extras in future seasons. Despite that, L&S is well worth a dip in your pocket if you're looking for good, old-fashioned, silly and fun comedy. Williams and Marshall are masters at their craft.",1092873600,14,1695,4.895470383275262

2069304,5,B000291Q3O,"On the heels of ""Happy Days"" came the spin off series, ""Lavern & Shirley"" a wacky teaming of two low brow brewery workers, Lavern DeFazio (Penny Marshall) and Shirley Feeney (Cindy Williams) who aspired to do better for themselves. The show's lunch bucket appeal easily translated to a profoundly enchanted feel good series. Apparently not entirely convinced of the show's self-sustaining potential, we get to see cast members from ""Happy Days"" reappear in several episodes in this box set (most notably, Fonzie (Henry Winkler) which contains the show's first 15 episodes. Though it's widely known that either Marshall or Williams got along on the set, the overwhelming success of the series forced the two to work out their differences in front of the camera.  The sustained bitterness sometimes shines through.

Highlights in this box set include an episode where Lenny (Michael McKean) and Squiggy (David L. Lander) secure prom dresses for the girl's big entre into society; a riotous high school reunion episode where an old classmate comes back to town as a nun; the wacky apartment episode in which Lenny and Squiggy move into the girl's apartment complex, only to discover that they can't live together; and, the hilarious dating episode in which Shirley finds herself the recipient of multiple male admirers and is flattered until she learns that Squiggy has been spreading a rumor that she is a ""fun"" date. In the annals of television sitcoms, ""Lavern & Shirley"" deserves a special place as one of the all time greats.

Paramount DVD has done a magnificent job of remastering these episodes to DVD. Colors are ultra rich, vibrant and extremely well balanced. Fine details are magnificently realized. Black levels are solid and deep. There are very few instances where age related artifacts can be detected and even less of an opportunity to spot film grain. Also, there's a complete absence of digital anomalies for as picture that is supremely smooth and easy on the eyes.  The audio is mono, as originally shot, but so nicely cleaned up and balanced that one can forget its shortcomings. There are no extras on this DVD - a real shame. It would have been nice to have at least a retrospective featurette or perhaps a few audio commentaries thrown in. Nevertheless, this DVD box set comes highly recommended for its stunning transfer quality that will surely NOT disappoint!",1092873600,2,2384,5.012626262626263

8024088,4,B000291Q3O,"""Laverne & Shirley"" was a spinoff of the hit sitcom, ""Happy Days,"" and was equally successful with two actresses like Cindy Williams (American Graffiti, The Conversation) as Shirley Feeney and Penny Marshall (The Odd Couple) as Laverne DeFazio, two best friends who live in a basement apartment in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. ""Happy Days"" was also set in Milwaukee as well. Laverne and Shirley work as beer bottle cappers at the Shotz Brewery. The supporting casting included Phil Foster (Papa DeFazio); Eddie Mekka (Carmine Ragusa aka ""The Big Ragu""); Michael McKean (Leonard Kozlowski) and David L. Lander (Squiggy) in the cast.

Since ""Laverne & Shirley"" was a midseason replacement, the first season has fewer episodes. But the first season sets the tone for the entire series about friendship, life, and happiness. Laverne and Shirley are best friends who want to find Mr. Right. The first season includes guest appearances with Fred Willard as Laverne's boyfriend, Pat Carroll as Shirley's critical mother, Helen Page Camp as the landlady, and others as well.

Unfortunately, the first season DVD doesn't have any special features. Surprisingly, ""Laverne & Shirley,"" still doesn't get the respect it deserves. Penny Marshall (Garry Marshall's sister became a successful director as well) and Cindy Williams would go on to raise her family and have an acting career. The two stars share a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television and have remained friends despite ups and downs in their relationship.",1482019200,,1508,5.253112033195021
