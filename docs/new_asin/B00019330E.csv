8008377,5,B00019330E,"I bought a Barbie DVD, The Princess and the Pauper, at a used book sale for my 3 year old grand daughter. I was delighted to find that it actually is very well made in every way. It had a great plot with lots of twists, beautiful and intricate animation throughout, music, dancing, children, pets, great art work, and best of all, it taught many virtues. She loved it and I loved it. We enjoyed watching them many times together. So I decided for Christmas to buy some used VHS versions of the three other Barbie movies and found the set. They are equally delightful and a wonderful introduction to ballet in The Nutcracker and Swan Lake. There are precious little ballerinas learning to dance, taught by Barbie, which transition into the fairy tales. In these three, I was not the least disappointed in the virtures they also teach. Beauty of character is the primary jewel possessed by these Barbie heroines. No mention of outward beauty, although it is certainly there. She'll love every one and so will you!",1300752000,,1011,4.653631284916201
8008378,4,B00019330E,"These movies not only teach kids some classic stories and classical music, the female characters are actually very strong role models for young girls...unlike many ""princess"" movies out there. They are fun for old and young, promoting interest in ballet and classical music.",1142726400,2,274,5.395348837209302
8008379,4,B00019330E,I bought these movies for my daughter (4) after renting Swan Lake twice.  My son who is 6 watched Swan Lake at least 20 times.  Both of my children enjoyed The Nutcracker.  Neither of them is as fond of Rapunzel.  My kids and I like the music in all the movies.  I have been pleasantly suprised with the quality of all the Barbie movies.,1141862400,,337,4.203125
8008380,5,B00019330E,"Overall these movies are suprisingly good.  They tell classic stories, have good music, and are rendered in high quality computer animation.  The Princess and the Pauper flick is also very good.  Unfortunately, with the most recent releases, Fairytopia and Pegasus, the budget appears to have come into play and the quality of the overall stories has suffered for it.  I would definitely recommend the first four films for any Barbie fans or those who just enjoy pricess stories.",1128988800,2,479,5.102564102564102
8008381,4,B00019330E,"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter,  now I can not peel here away from the television.  She gets up in the morning and wants to watch one, when that one is over she wants to watch another, and then the last one.  She loves the nutcracker the best.  They are allright I have had to sit with her and watch them.  They stay pretty close to the original storyline's, except for a few changes in them.  For instance there was no dragon friend in the original Rapunzel.  Other than that they are pretty good.  I am going to take her to the Nutcracker Ballet to see how she enjoy that. She also has the Princess and the Pauper Barbie on DVD. I have not seen that one yet.  But I would recommend to anyone whose daughters like Barbie.",1100995200,8,732,4.134751773049645
