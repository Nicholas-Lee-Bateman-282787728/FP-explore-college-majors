6254254,5,B00I9BU2IC,"My flabber was quite gasted when I discovered this long lost gem available to order.  Having tried to track it down some years ago,  I had found a fan website claiming that it was lost forever and that only a few severely colour damaged segments remained.
Well thank you Warner Archives for finding this, as I am so delighted to see again this series that I so loved when it was first transmitted.  Over here in the UK it was called ""Search Control"".  The picture quality is very good for a series of this vintage.
I'm afraid there are no extras, and the cover art is a bit cheap and cheerful, but no matter, because it is the episode content that is the main thing, and in this I have not been disappointed.
Of course the technology and culture are seriously dated (though personally I miss the respect and charm of the 70s) but, and here's the rub - the concept was almost prescient, with wearable technology now coming to the fore.  You still a have to forgive some obvious impossibilities like geopositioning and comms that work indoors and outdoors and anywhere in the world, and biological sensors that work from a distance, but interestingly the series could have a lot to say about the pace and HMI dialogue we need if wearable tech is to fulfil its promise.
The scripts are light hearted PI-type 70s material, but still manage to entertain.  What I really love though is the title sequence of colourful 60s/70s style graphics, set to Dominic Frontiere's wonderful theme tune.  Kind of reminds me of some of the earlier Bond title sequences.
The only worry is that being made to order on DVD-R media, I'm not sure how long the shelf life will be.  Can anyone hazard a guess?",1396656000,35,1682,4.546357615894039

6254258,5,B00I9BU2IC,"Search was a futuristic adventure series that ran from 1972-'73.  It was futuristic when it was shown, not so futuristic today.  The show concerned a detective/investigative agency where the operatives wear little cameras at all times and microphones inserted into their ears.  As a result of this a large group of technicians can see and hear everything their operatives do. They can also monitor their investigators physical health while out on their missions.  The agency is run by the always flustered Burgess Meredith and one of the technicians is the utterly beautiful Angel Tompkins.
The pilot for this series was a made-for-tv movie entitled ""Probe"" and starred Hugh O' Brian as operative Hugh Lockwood.  The pilot also starred the stunning Elke Sommer and Sir John Gielgud.  The made for films did well enough for  the series to be picked up.  Like many Warner Brothers series of the '50s and '60s, it was determined that more than one operative was needed so Tony Franciosa and Doug McClure joined the series as fellow ""probes"" to O'Brian.
The show was produced and created by Leslie Stevens who earlier gave us The Outer Limits and Stoney Burke.  Robert E. Justman from Star Trek was also involved.
The show aired Wednesday nights at 10PM on NBC.  It did not do well against (the far inferior) Cannon on CBS was cancelled after only one season.  I watched it and enjoyed it immensely.  If you want a well-produced, highly inventive and enjoyable series, you could do a lot worse than picking this set up.",1394755200,20,1515,4.852140077821011

6254260,5,B00I9BU2IC,"It's hard for me to be objective where this series is concerned. When it debuted in 1971 it was a futuristic, spy espionage series in a TV decade that was over-run with a host of gritty cop shows that sprang the the films 'Serpico' & 'The French Connection', and probably best typified by Kojak. SEARCH retained a bit of the spy genre fun & fantasy of ""The Man From Uncle"" -- and there was nothing even remotely similar to it in 1971-72. Not on American TV anyway. My favorite PROBE. was Lockwood, who launched the series with the incredibly well produced & cast TV movie PROBE (1971). Hugh O'Brian as former astronaut Hugh Lockwood, was clever, worldly, and dare I say it, cocky. Well into middle-age, Hugh O'Brian was in many ways like Sean Connery in ""Diamonds Are Forever"", also filmed in 1971. He'd played hours upon hours of action on 'Wyatt Earp' and was nearing the end of his action star run, much like Connery was ending his tenure as Bond. And interesting, diamonds played a huge part in PROBE. Doug McClure, and Tony Franciosa, were both also very enjoyable on the series. The three made great counterparts to one another. It's been mentioned that the three had obvious ""peter pan"" complexes. Refusing to grow up. That could be the reason that the show seemed to capture a large youth audience, which is serving it well now with people my age grabbing up copies & making it  the #1 seller week after week on 'The Warner Archive Collection'.",1394323200,,1452,4.6061776061776065

Classic 70s TV for sure
2 bad NBC didn't pick up another season for Search.
Loved the cars, the worldwide travel, locales ( even if shot in So CA or some set)
show got my interest in Lockwoods 450 SL Benz & Nicks Jensen which was in Fast & Furious 6 movie customized.

Having Probe Control bathed in red lights means Probe is 24/7 operation.
Love concept for WSC & microimplants then

Imagine micro implants Today & scanner camera done Today too, awesome.

The pilot Probe is a classic.

Notice how they use Burbank Airport & note PSA airlines in background.

Like Grover as the beach boy Probe, Nick ""gangster Probe, & Lockwood Main Probe.

6254266,3,B00I9BU2IC,"Three and a half stars for this piece of 70's nostalgia.  As others have noted, the pilot movie titled ""Probe"" is not part of this collection.  In the pilot we're introduced to the recently departed Hugh O'Brien's character, an ex-astronaut named Lockwood who works for this outfit called World Securities.  He's a ""probe"" agent equipped with an audio implant, dental electronic signalling contact and a so-called scanner which includes a miniaturized camera and other sensors which can be worn magnetically attached to a variety of gaudy jewelry pieces. This gadgetry allows him to be linked to Probe Control headed up by Burgess Meredith's Mr. Cameron and a team of techies working computers and satellite links giving our agent assistance on the fly.  40 years ago this was heady stuff but nowdays your iPhone and Siri can do pretty much the same thing as Probe Control.  The pilot was quite good and also included the stunning Elke Sommers and Angel Tompkins to boot.  Obviously it was good enough to spawn a full season series.

The series now called ""Search"" only got one season from 1972-73 before being cancelled.  This DVD set includes those episodes with no bonus features of any kind.  Lamentably we only get Ms. Tompkins back for one guest spot with her spot on the Probe Control team being filled by other generic female techs.  Also the producers decided to add two other agents to the mix, Tony Franciosa as the smarmy Nick Bianco, an ex-NYPD cop now working for World Securities and C.R. Grover played by Doug McClure, a beach bum type who seems to be ill equipped for most of his missions.  O'Brien's the best of the bunch and maybe if they'd stuck with him and developed his character more the show might have lasted longer.

Younger viewers or those of us who's memories of the show when broadcast are fuzzy have to remember the context of the times when it was made.  So, this is typical 70's TV, hokey dialog, squealing tire car chases (yes, car tires really were that lousy back then), poorly choreographed fight scenes, and the like.  The Probe scanner device is still interesting enough and the global hopping lifestyle of our agents is engaging even though the scripts often didn't offer much in the way of intriguing plots.  As others have mentioned, the breezy Dominic Frontiere theme music is one of the best of that era and sticks in your head long after the show is over...in a good way.  If you can overlook the cheesy production values ""Search"" is still worth revisiting.

Recommended for 70's nostalgia buffs and those who like a little sci-fi mixed in with their detective shows.  Just don't be surprised that the series fails to live up to the pilot; there's a reason it was cancelled after a single season after all.",1478476800,7,2752,4.757894736842105

The leading characters were played by a fine group of actors, namely Burgess Meredith (The Penguin in the Batman TV series of the 60's) who controlled things from Probe Control,and the agents (called Probes) were Hugh O'Brian (who was in many western series' and in Bruce Lee's film Game of Death), Doug McClure (Trampas in The Virginian TV series) and Tony Franciosa - each of the agents appearing in their own individual episodes.
The probes each carried a scanner - a very small video camera which could be attached to a ring or pendant, which was monitored by Burgess and his team and could be used to check the probe's heart, blood pressure etc, and had infra-red detection etc and could even detect if someone else was hiding in the room by picking up life signs.
They also had dental/ear implants so they had two way communication with Probe Control. The series also had some great guests including Stefanie Powers and Bill Bixby to name but two.
If you are looking for a bit of 70's nostalgia and pure escapism, this is a show you should check out.

6254296,4,B00I9BU2IC,"The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that there is some very annoying pixelation of the image from time to time on at least the second episode on the first disk. (I haven't watched all the episodes yet.) Since this product is created after an order is received, I'm guessing they streamed the movies from Warner Brothers at a time when there were several solar flares close together. It looks like either the satellite had hiccups, or a geomagnetic storm created interference with the ground-based signals.

I placed my order on 11-4-2014. According to Spaceweather.com, there were M-class and X-class flares starting on 11-4-2014 and running through 11-7-2014. So I guess the take-away from this is to not place an order for a product that gets created after the order is placed unless there are NOT large, active sunspots whose effects can be felt on earth during the next several days.

That said, the only reason I didn't give it less than 4 stars is that I'm really glad to be able to see this series again. I've had the pilot for a while. I'm glad they finally made the other episodes available for purchase.

I am always intrigued by how they were able to foresee the technological advances as far back as 40 years ago that we take for granted now! I feel obligated to tell my kid that all that computerization, miniaturization and wireless communication were not commonplace back then. Young people today have no clue!

I love Dominic Frontiere's music. It really sets the tone. And I'm amazed at the expense they must have gone to when they did those chase scenes and destroyed cars, etc. Today's so-called ""reality"" shows can't hold a candle to the time, effort and money that went into TV series back then.

6254307,5,B00I9BU2IC,"The above words are from a preseason TV Guide article about ""Search"" -- and they were right.  ""Search"" was one of the slickest, most sophisticated entertainment series ever.  In a 1970s phosphor-dot universe full of elite detectives and spies, the operatives of PROBE were above and beyond all the others.

Each detective, called a Probe, was equipped with a minuscule camera/telemetry transmitter, a dental implant for surreptitious communication, and a subcutaneous ear jack, all of which kept them connected with the computer analysts at PROBE Control.  The operatives were handsome, they were smooth, and they always cracked the case and ended up with the girl.  These were old-fashioned, fast-paced adventures, full of complicated criminal schemes, heroics, wisecracks and beautiful women.  And for four decades only the rarely-aired pilot and some grainy uploads from an Australian TV network have been available.  Now these highly entertaining episodes are FINALLY available on DVD.  Thank you, Warner Archive, thank you!

So how did Warner do?

The packaging:

This six DVD set comes in an adequate plastic storage box with spoked hubs.  The box's front illustration is a little bit unimaginative.  It's nice, but looks like somebody threw it together in about twenty minutes.  More on that later.  The box also comes with no outer or liner listing of the episodes.

The DVDs:

The DVDs themselves have nice printing, but are labeled ""Disc one"", ""Disc two"", etc.  With no episode titles on either the box or the DVDs themselves, the only way to tell which episodes are on which DVDs is by loading them into your player and looking at the menu.  Bad design, but nothing that you can't solve by looking up the info on the internet, printing it out and sticking it in the box.  (I've included an episode list at the end of my review, along with the name of the PROBE agent who is featured in each show.)

The DVD menus themselves are lackluster.  The title ""SEARCH"" looks rather ragged (same as the outer box), and PROBE's twin-globe logo is pretty fuzzy.  Even a moderately talented graphic artist who knows Photoshop (see me raising my hand?) could have cleaned that up and perhaps even come up with something snazzier.

The DVDs lack sub-menus that take you to individual acts of each episode.  It's not a big problem.  They do have chapter marks in each episode, all set at the beginning of each act, and that's the next best thing.

These DVDs are burned on demand, not pressed, and the packaging warns -- in very tiny type -- that they are designed to play only on DVD PLAYERS, not recorders and not computers.  I managed to play them on my Magnavox DVD recorder/player, but was unable to run them on my iMac.  The disks are also Region 0, so they should theoretically play on any DVD player anywhere in the world.

Thus far I've had two problems during playback.  The episodes ""Moonrock"" and ""Let Us Prey"" stuck in a couple of places, for just a few seconds.  It's very possible this is a result of Warner squeezing too many episodes onto each disk.  It might have been better to go with an eight disk set with three episodes each.

The picture also stuttered a bit in the opening credits for the first episode, ""The Murrow Disappearance"", where the dot-pattern wipes (listing the guest stars) seemed to jump instead of move smoothly.  That stutter disappeared by the second episode, so it's entirely likely that that was a flaw in the original print, and not in the DVD burning itself.

The episodes:

The play's the thing, and these 23 episodes shine!  Colors are good in general.  The odd individual shot can be muddy, less sharp with a bluish color which is very unlike the rest of the scenes, suggesting that the original 35mm prints may have been damaged at those points and Warner utilized a less-than-ideal substitute.  On the other hand, tints become beautiful during scenes set inside PROBE Control, and the graphics-heavy opening credits are absolutely GORGEOUS, with clean, vivid hues.  With the exception of the few bluish shots I mentioned, these film transfers are so breathtakingly sharp and clear they are almost HD quality -- quite remarkable for a show that hasn't seen the light of day in four decades!

Sound is good.  These DVDs do not come with closed captioning, either on the DVDs themselves or in the TV vertical interval.  This is usually a big no-no for me, since I (like a lot of other people my age) am getting hard of hearing.  Yet the dialogue is clear.  I've noticed this phenomenon on ""The Avengers"" DVDs too, probably attributable to the fact that these were monaural soundtracks working within a relatively limited audio bandwidth; it's one of the few times that NOT having a rich 20-20,000 Hz 5.1 audio range can work to your advantage.

If you want to be picky, that limited range does give Dominic Frontiere's versatile score a little bit of a tinny sound.  But his music is so sumptuous, so perfect for the show, that it's hard to complain.

Seeing these shows for the first time since I was a teenager, I'd forgotten how tightly-edited they are.  In terms of story, photography and technique, they hold up very well today.  The only thing that looks hopelessly pass is the use of women as rewards...but that was that era, and today is vastly different.

Going through the episodes it's fun to play Spot-the-Guest-Star, what with all the `60s and `70s TV luminaries who appeared in the show.  Even ""M*A*S*H""'s resident idiot, played by Larry Linville, shows up in one episode in a very non-Frank Burns role as a Treasury Department official.

One thing I hadn't remembered was the extensive use of locations.  ""Search"" must have been an expensive show to produce for the time, not just because of PROBE Control, but because an individual storyline could take a PROBE to as many as five or six different locations around the world.  That's a lot of use of the (pretty convincing) Warner Brothers backlot sets and local wilderness areas.  Matched up with stock film depictions of London, Paris, the Middle East and other places, they gave ""Search"" a globe-trotting flavor.  Some of the more ambitious episodes play almost like little travelogues.

Fans will notice a change in the show at mid-season.  PROBE Control was moved out its dimly-lit NASA-like control center into a better-lit, bunker-like setting.  The reason is anybody's guess, but even more unfortunate were the decisions to de-emphasize PROBE Control and to spin considerably grimmer story lines.  This sort of thing has happened with a number of other series (""Switch"" is a great example), but moving away from the very concepts that made the show fresh and charming in the first place has pretty much never worked, and it doesn't work here.  ""Search"" remained interesting to the end, but unfortunately the latter half of the series lost some of its mojo.

Incidentally, somebody mentioned that it was nice that Warner included the ""Search"" bumpers.  If they mean the red-and-blue globe motif that begins and ends each act, frankly I don't see how they could have possibly cut them off.  They are similar to those little sketches that ended each act of ""The Wild Wild West"" -- they're part of the show.  I do recall that ""Search"" had a pair of roughly six-second bumpers that bracketed the local station ID at the half-hour mark.  Those are not included on these DVDs.

Conclusion:

All in all, with the few caveats I mentioned, ""Search"" fans will adore this release.  It takes you back to a time when TV could still be light-hearted, clever and adventurous.  And while the gadgets of PROBE Control are gradually becoming reality in our modern day world, the ""cool"" factor still runs strong in these stylish, imaginative episodes.  They're a welcome throwback to an era when TV was still fun.

The technology is not so impressive in today's world and that might make it seem outdated to those who have never seen this show.  The three lead actors (Hugh O'Brian,, Tony Franciosa and Doug McClure) all rotate (a la ""The Name of The Game"") and each one is very charismatic which makes the show enjoyable to watch.  Some of the best humor comes from Burgess Merideth and Angel Tompkins who are back in the control room and get to virtually tag along with each agent while on they are on a case.  The stories are only slightly above average, but I think the show deserved more time to fine-tune its characters and premise.

I suppose there are two reasons to watch it.  You might be wanting to see all the episodes if you have missed some as a kid; this is why I bought it.  The other reason would be if you have some interest to see a classic example of decent science fiction of this era.  It is good 70s TV.  Love the medallions.",1405555200,7,585,4.0701754385964914
6254314,4,B00I9BU2IC,"I really wish I could give this beloved old series a perfect score, but I just can't.  It is NOT the way I remember it, a great premise full of cool gadgets, beautiful lonely women and double-entendres.  The PILOT had all of those things, but the series gradually lost them all.  Everybody was an old friend of Nick or Grover.  I HATED the changes to the control room and the people.  Gloria Harding appeared in WAY fewer episodes than I remembered.  Cam seemed to lose interest in warning his agents that other vital signs were nearby.  Maybe this was caused by the agents' eagerness to disobey him.  The early-1970's ""I don't like guns"" mentality bothered me at the time, and still does (see also ""The Rockford Files"").  The last two episodes on the last diskette are out of order, shot during the first season and then just slapped on to the end of the last diskette as though the editor had grown so weary of watching the show that he just couldn't be bothered to put them in the right places.

Despite everything I've said (and the stuff I decided wasn't important enough to include here), I just can't bring myself to give this series a bad score.  I LOVED this show the first time around, despite its flaws.  And now I own every single episode; I can watch them any time I feel like it.

6254316,4,B00I9BU2IC,"Warner Archives has recently brought the entire series, minus the pilot movie, ""Probe"", to DVD. As usual, Warners has done a superb job in visuals and audio for fans of the show. The series only lasted one season, and apparently was seldom, if ever, in syndication. On a preservation level, then, Warners has made the show available for its fans and kept their high reputation for treating the episodes with respect, as they have with their other dramatic TV series DVDs.

I could ask, as I have many times on Warners' superbly done late '50s Westerns series, why the bumpers are intact on Search, but missing from those shows. That's strange because those series, such as Maverick, Cheyenne and Sugarfoot, made such a big deal out of the bumper breaks.

I'm just hoping by the time Warners has music clearances to its private eye series of that time period, like 77 Sunset Strip and Bourbon Street Beat, that they will have heard me bitch about it so much, they will make sure the bumpers are included with the releases.

The running times on the complete series release of Search indicate the episodes are uncut versions. The color reproduction is vibrant throughout. It is easy to see why NBC would want to try to keep the show alive past one season. They had three of the top male TV actors going into the '70s as the lead performers in the series. The only thing missing in Search is Leslie Stevens's inherent vision and voice.

But that is not Warners's problem.

You can explore that topic on my new Riding Shotgun column on Search at comicsbulletin.com.
Hope you enjoy it.

6254317,5,B00I9BU2IC,"A couple of years ago I reviewed the 90 minute 1972 pilot episode for the series Search called PROBE where Hugh Lockwood, an investigator for World Securities, is telemetrically linked up to his headquarters by a neural earjack and tooth beeper and carried a tiny sophisticated TV scanner on a medallion, tie-pin or ring to relay information and be told things as he sought out a missing jewel collection. Weve seen such technology, well, miniature cameras anyway, in shows in recent years but this was from 1972 and in those days was still regarded as Science Fiction far beyond what we could do today.
  This pilot used to appear on TV from time to time in the UK, the last time back in the 1980s. A Search chat group I belong finally convinced Warner Bros to include it in the special archive release, helped a little by people there who remembered seeing it themselves when young. PROBE had charm, humour, good casting and an intelligent plot combined with probably the best theme music ever by Dominic Frontiere. You can find a copy of the music on UTube if you need convincing. It turns out that we weren't the only ones who remembered the show because it became a massive seller for Warners and convinced them to release the 23 episode series Search that followed. If those of you in the UK remember it being called Search Control, the name change here was because there was a documentary series out around the same time so it couldn't be called that. Said name is still used on IMDb, although I suspect that has more to do with the problem with just putting the word Search into search engines.
  As a series, Search used the format of The Name Of The Game (another series Leslie Stevens formatted) of having three rotating leads because actor Hugh OBrian, having back problems, didn't want to do a weekly recording turnover. In many respects, this was a healthy move for the show. I mean why would any organisation have a single investigator succeed at everything. This way, you got the feel of a working organisation doing their job. So, next to PROBE One, Hugh Lockwood, there was also Omega PROBE Nick Bianco (actor Tony Franciosa) who dealt with more police like-cases and stand-by PROBE C.R. Grover (actor Doug McClure), not exactly an apprentice but still finding his feet with his boss. Throughout all of this, the team back at PROBE Control is led by V.C.R. Cameron (actor Burgess Meredith). For those with keen eyes, Griffin is played by Albert Popwell, who amongst who claims to fame was in Dirty Harry as the first person who nearly made Harry Callahans day and was consequently in each of the film series in different parts. Angel Tompkins as Gloria Harding also reprised her role chiefly with the Lockwood stories.
  The title of the show might be a giveaway as to the content. PROBEs (the initials standing for Programmed Retrieval Operations with the BE being top secret as stated in the pilot PROBE) are there to find things or missing people using hi-tech to get things done. Its panache made it stand out because it brought an edge of comedy to the proceedings to balance the bite it occasionally had. Uniquely, I haven't seen any of the plots used like it since. The closest relative to Ends Of The Earth is ITV The Avengers story Bizarre and even that is superficial elements. The MO of telemetric communication to headquarters was one of a kind which meant it couldn't be written like any other show. Anyone could ring their bosses but to have constant communication and relay live action by satellite, that as new and why it held an attraction to those of us who watched back in the 70s. Its only in recent years we discovered that Hugh OBrian and Tony Franciosa thought that the telemetrics gave them too much of an edge and hadnt realised the significance of the show for doing just that.
  Search really had its own style. I mean with Moonrock with Lockwood in pursuit of a stolen giant diamond and no other aeroplane available, charters a 747 on his credit card with Cameron authorising the funds from his end. Even the prospect of the PROBEs getting the woman at the end was turned on its head with Cameron getting the odd date instead. Everything was up for grabs and not always predictable. The cast list was a whos who of good actors at the time including Jeff Corey, Stefanie Powers, Bill Bixby and Barbara Feldon.
  Picking out favourite stories is difficult, especially as I don't want to give away too much about the endings. For Lockwood, it has to be Moonrock, The Gold Machine,The Bullet, Suffer My Child, The Adonis File and Flight To Nowhere (this one for the stunt double jumping over the edge of a building and smashing through a window). For Bianco, Operation Iceman and Let Us Prey. For Grover, Short Circuit and The Packagers. Moment Of Madness put Burgess Meredith onto the centre stage with a marvellous performance. I hate picking favourites but those were exceptional.
  Why has the series been hidden in the vaults so long? Creator Leslie Stevens (who alsos formulated The Outer Limits), having gotten Search started and contributed a few scripts was also in the process of creating a different series for another studio which royally pissed off the Warner Bros executives at the time. So much so, he was effectively booted off his own show and certain changes were made to PROBE Control, with fewer people there and done in a white and brightly lit set compared to the darkness of the earlier episodes. At least that way you can tell the difference with the changes. It also had a repercussions for actress Angel Tompkins who had been promised full pay for when she had more involvement in stories than the equivalent days wages for working in Control and was fired and blacklisted by Warners for ten years after having to fight for her wages in The Gold Machine. The wrath also ensured that the series only had one airing around the world and got hidden away. No longer! Thats all history now and well never know if they could have kept up this unique aspect of the show to a second series.
  If your DVD player is multi-regional, then Search should certainly be on your list to watch. Its already doing big business in the USA and if youve ever wondered what this editor always got inspired by and kept his interest in over 32 years, you might want to take a look. If you already bought PROBE then Search will be the one series youll be wondering how you missed it when young.",1399161600,5,6437,4.644991212653778

The operatives were hooked into main control via a wearable camera, implanted dental and ear pieces. It was way ahead of it's time and left the air much too soon. I was surprised this collection did not include the pilot TV movie for the series, called ""Probe"", but one cannot have everything. If you are a fan of this series, you will not be disappointed.

6254320,5,B00I9BU2IC,"Unfortunately,it didn't find one and only lasted one season. I don't know why as this is one good action and adventure series. All about an agency who send probes (agents) out to help wealthy clients, people who are in danger usually with some connection in world power politics.
The three agents Hugh O'Brien, (The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp)Doug McCure,(The Virginian) and Tony Franciosa(The Name of the Game) all have transmitting and receiving chips inserted in their ear so they can be monitored back at headquarters by World Securities Systems Chief,played by Burgess Meredith, a world class actor who's acting career spanned many generations from the 1930's to his later roles as Mickey in the ""Rocky"" movies. The agents also have mini camera's inserted in their rings or tie-pins so HQ can see what each agent can see.
Each of the lead actors alternated each week with each other. Maybe that's why it was not a hit. They had tried this format before on the final season of ""The Virginian"" and it didn't work. The only series that was a hit with this particular format was ""The Name of the Game"" which starred Gene Barry,Robert Stack and coincidentally Tony Franciosa who is one of the leads in this series.
The pilot for this show called ""Probe"" was released a while ago as a standalone DVD.

Looking back on it now, I found I enjoyed Tony Franciosa episodes more. Nick Bianco was cool, level-headed while being able to add humor to defuse the tension. Hugh O'Brian's character came across was too cocky, and there were times when the character couldn't take a punch. FYI, during the fight scenes, you can tell O'Brian's double was doing all the work. The guy was younger, leaner and hair more wavy. Doug McClure was too simple at times, also using comedic relief when necessary. Would I like to see it brought back? Yes. A lot has changed in the world of espionage in 45 years, so story ideas could be endless. What I would change is the lag time in some episodes to get to the story. Did I really need to watch Lockwood woo the female in the first twenty minutes? No. Shorten it to five minutes. Also, tighten the dialogue. It lagged at times.
