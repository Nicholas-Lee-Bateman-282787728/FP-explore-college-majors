3567035,5,B001FB55H6,"Okay, perhaps not. However, ""Watchmen"" does overall successfully adapt one of the greatest graphic novels, and stories in general, for that matter. So, where does one begin?

So much paid off for this movie, it's almost unimaginable. It creates near immediate skepticism and criticism, especially when looking at the points the big names in the industry made about this movie while it was in production. And at times, when I first caught a glimpse of the trailer when I went on opening night, as I did this movie, to see ""The Dark Knight"" I was hesitant and yet intrigued. I still am. Even my rating of this film makes me think, makes me wonder. The film and novel alike have stirred so much thought and really got my mind working that I only feel it fitting to rate it so highly.

So what made the movie? For starters, as mentioned before, there were constant snags with the movie constantly getting tied up in production. Terry Gilliam, esteemed Python, actor, and director, called the movie ""unfilmable."" Granted he said this years ago when CGI was a lot different, but his thought was it should be an extended television mini-series, one that, if put together, it would be hours long. And to top it off, there's Fox refusal to green-light the film, calling the script the ""worst piece of s**t"" they had ever read. All looked grim for the movie and perhaps it was in that simple fact that the movie makers were able to learn from these, and make a better movie than anyone could've imagined. In fact there is an odd sense of irony in themes. Dr. Manhattan himself is born in the form he is through sheer determination and force of will.

Thankfully, almost any single person who has ever read the graphic novel will be stunned at how sincerely close the movie is story-wise to the novel. It was a joy seeing some of my favorite scenes put into action. For the un-initiated, the story begins with the murder of The Comedian, but not before, in this movie, an already infamous montage of the parallel events this movie to real life United States, up until 1985, set to Bob Dylan's ""The Times Are Changing."" We see the murder vividly, onscreen, but the killer's face is obscured. And thus does Rorschach set out on his quest to unravel the mystery of his death and of a plot so deep that when I first read the book, I found the end result to nearly unravel my very thoughts. The ending here is different, but it works to achieve the same effect. Some may say that it works even better than the original, and truth be told, there will now forever be a constant argument over which ending is better.

The acting was for the most part superb. Billy Crudup played the role of Dr. Manhattan wonderfully. Even when he is almost entirely obscured by CGI (on a side note: if you're so bothered by his gosh darned willie hanging out boldly, then you must be gay. It's so hard to see and gets so little screen time, you would have to be look (HARD) for it to even really notice it. End rant) he plays the near-emotionless Dr. Manhattan fluidly, as though he has been him all his life. It is very difficult to realize you are seeing the same actor in the flashback scenes when he is still John Osterman. Jackie Earle Haley also plays an amazingly believable Rorschach. I saw production shots of him long before I saw this movie, and I wasn't sure he fit the role well. Seeing this movie, I realize just how good of a match he turned out to be. These two had the best performances, partially due to their extended, near-constant screen times. All of the other actors as well were good as well, though more often than not, they would be the ones to stumble. While I don't see most of the sex scenes as hilarious as many critics would like them to seem, there was one particularly extended scene where I found myself shaking my head in disbelief at it. I remembered the comic, the scene was pure and absolute art, which almost no graphic or gratuitous sex. Here, though, it was like a sick parody of the novel.

And now, the absolute high point, the cinematography and visuals will leave you breathtaken. It is as Roger Ebert claimed it, it is like 300, but whereas the feel of that movie was somewhat detatched, ""this movie actually had substance."" Visually, you will be hard pressed to find many movies better than this (though, certainly, the entire line of Star Wars  movies come to mind almost immediately, alongside the Lord of the Rings trilogy). And the film noir influence here is obvious and stunning. If the filmmakers didn't watch Blade Runner at least 10 times while making this move (perhaps even once frame-by-frame) I will be amazed. Speaking of ""frame-by-frame"" I cannot wait for this to come out on DVD to catch the many easter eggs in the movie (oh yes, they are there if you look closely). As yet another film critic wrote of this film, it is ""visually orgasmic.""

And now, my final thoughts. There are so many things I would like to mention, say, imagine. This movie, and the novel, are so thought-provoking it can't be fathomed until exploring either. That said, I can hardly wait for the extended version of this film to come out, with some scenes cut or trimmed for time reasons (realize this movie already has a runtime of 2 hours and 43 minutes) that will be restored, and then an even further restored version with the ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" ""comic-within-a-comic"" included as well (though I highly recommend picking this up, if only on rental, on DVD when it comes out, because it will also include various other commentaries and background story such as ""Under the Hood."") when it comes out on DVD.

If you liked the novel, you should like the movie. Things were cut, but what was cut was done for good reason and tastefully. It all works in the end. And for the Watchmen virgins of the world, see the movie first, and then read the book. The movie takes a sometimes long-winded story and makes it understandable to the viewer. From there, the viewer can take that same story and expand on it with the book, which is filled with so much more notes, backstory, etc. that for a first-time reader like myself, it was difficult to make perfect sense of the first time around.

***** Five Stars

Pros:

- Superb Story
- Some of the greatest visuals you will find in modern movies
- An amazing story
- A changed ending that is as good, if possibly better, than the original
- A wonderful cast

Cons:

- Story very occasionally stumbles
- Acting is off at times
- An unnecessarily long (and horribly overdone) sex scene
- Overdone use of gore and profanity that was rarely used, if ever, in the source material

Last note (possible spoilers): Though I think the new ending was wonderful and used to great effect, nothing will ever replace the opening images of Chapter 12 of the novel, the only time a book, graphic novel or otherwise, has made me imagine it going so perfectly alongside dark and grim-sounding organs. For those who have never read the comic, be warned, it is such a powerful image that they decided to leave it out of the film simply because it would be too disturbing to see put to life.",1236297600,2,7122,4.5279937791601865
3567036,5,B001FB55H6,"Readers of the Watchmen comic rejoice--the movie (for once) actually does it justice.

Never have I ever seen a movie adaptation of ANYTHING that so dedicatedly follows the actual contents of the original work. Certain things had to be cut, naturally- the movie approaches the three hour mark as it is. But what was important has been kept safe, what was lost was paid tribute, and what is entirely missing has its own DVD coming out.

Also, going into the theater I was afraid I would be watching Sin City, 300 and, god help us, The Spirit, all over again with a Watchmen smiley face on it. The styles of 300 and Sin City particularly are a great asset to the films, making them closer to visual art than your average live-action. But they wouldn't work pasted on another movie like bad clip-art, as might have been apparent after The Spirit. Lucky for us, the people who made Watchmen aren't complete idiots, and the style they developed for this movie was completely it's own, and more than perfectly appropriate.

In conclusion, high five to everyone who worked on this movie. And just as a warning to those who have not yet read the actual comic... You might want to get on that before you see this movie. It is not full of happy fun times, and might put a damper on your evening if you can not embrace some serious cynicism in your life.

Also, Rorschach=BAMF. All I'm sayin'.",1236297600,7,1382,4.538152610441767
3567037,4,B001FB55H6,"Watchmen's only downfall may be that it is too complex and brilliant a story to appeal to a general public expecting a simple action-filled superhero movie.  More an intricate conspiracy thriller than a crime-fighting actioner, Watchmen plays out around an earth-shattering mystery, but the process of uncovering the truth retains the stimulating adventure, flashy visuals, and mesmerizing blend of sensationalism and morbid examination of human nature expected from a new generation of comic book movies.  Watchmen is a no-holds-barred exploration into infinite power and its subsequent corruption, draped in the visceral glory of the most imaginative visual minds.

Watchmen is set in an alternate 1985 where masked superheroes once ruled the night, the United States won the Vietnam War, and Richard Nixon continues his Presidency as the ""Doomsday"" clock predicting total nuclear destruction remains set at 5 minutes to midnight. The twisted plot unfolds through the eyes of washed-up former superhero Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), a masked vigilante whose paranoid psychosis is surpassed only by his uncompromising quest for justice.  When The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a Watchman with sadistic methods of retribution is mysteriously murdered, Rorschach scours the underbelly of the city for clues to his comrade's untimely demise.  Uncovering a devastating conspiracy to kill all remaining superheroes, he must enlist the aid of several former colleagues, including Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) and Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman), to wage a suicidal war against a criminal mastermind of nearly limitless power.

Presented in a film noir narration by Rorschach, Watchmen is nothing less than a superhero movie fused with action, drama, romance, science-fiction, fantasy, crime thriller, and murder mystery. To call it simply a comic book movie wouldn't do it justice; in fact, with its lack of actual paranormal powers, it's really not a superhero movie at all. It intricately blends politics, morals, and societal complexities into an unrelenting thinking-man's fantasy epic that intelligently challenges the ideas of vigilantism, nuclear war and the abuse of power. But will the superhero crowd, not entirely familiar with Watchmen lore, embrace a film so esoterically heavy and appropriately lengthy?

With so many plots, red herrings and backstories to tell, Watchmen clocks in at nearly three hours long - and still can't cover everything. Most impressive is the amazing visuals and unique imagery brought to life from Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon's graphic novel, coupled with sex, action and violence never before seen in a comic book movie. There's no shortage of nudity or graphic bloodshed in Watchmen as the fate of the world rests on the shoulders of psychopaths, glorified gang members with a penchant for dressing up and finishing what the law can't, and a nuclear accident victim gone awry. To call Watchmen simply a comic book movie would be as helpful as ""a photograph of oxygen to a drowning man.""

3567038,5,B001FB55H6,"After all the hype, all the years of fan dreams and anticipation, all the legal drama, and all the praises bestowed upon the legendary graphic novel, ""Watchmen"" is now a major motion picture and critical Armageddon is about to break loose.  There are two kinds of people who will watch The Watchmen; those who will hail it as an amazing cinema achievement and those who will hate it with a flaming passion.  I'm onboard with the former, every other person I saw it with is the latter. I'm buying the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/graphic-novel/dp/0930289234/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">graphic novel</a>&nbsp;tomorrow so keep in mind that this review is from the point of view of a Watchmen virgin.  Fans of cinema lite who wanted another Batman or Spider-Man movie, step off; this one is not for you.  This is for the real deal heavy thinkers out there who want to be challenged and like their comic adaptations with more than a little noir.  There are no big name actors, no large-scale seat of your pants action scenes, and no holding of the audience's hand. This will be the mnost divisive film of the year.  Let the flamewars begin.

The story is impossible to describe in a mere review.  The concepts too epic and weighty to put on paper or pixels.  This film follows the motto of one of it's characters: ""Never compromise, even in the face of  Armageddon"".  Amen, brothers and sisters.  This film is exactly what it wants to be and it does not give a damn what anybody else thinks.  It's better than hardcore and fills the screen with images that often constitute the very last things an audience wants to see, be it numerous onscreen penis shots, sexually impotent and psychotic protagonists, a villainous sacrifice that serves as an act of heroism, and a general acknowledgment that we are all worthless insects who are destined to destroy each other.  The Comedian would laugh long and hard at the inevitable backlash against this film.  All of the shiny happy people who thought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight/dp/B001GZ6QDS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight</a>&nbsp;was harsh and pessimistic; prepare for a dose of reality.  ""Watchmen"" will likely not be a commercial success and it will not start a new kind of superhero trend.  But the very fact that it got made and released in this form is a sign that the times are indeed changing in the favor of the blackhearted comic geek.  Brings a smile to my face.

The cast is wonderful, perfectly flawed, and fitting for the unbelievably black tone of the story.  Malin Akerman  is officially the comic film hottie to beat.  Her striking looks and effortlessly exuded sexuality make her the perfect woman to star as Miss Jupiter.  Carla Gugino is also fantastic as her mother, the former Silk Specter (hottest superheroine name ever) who refuses to age gracefully.  Jackie Earle Haley is 100% bada$z as Rorschach (pronounced ror-shak) and is arguably the bet character.  He closely resembles Frank Miller's Batman if he ever truly went over the edge and gave up on humanity altogether.  That ink-blot mask of his is mesmerizing too.  Nite Owl is an awkward soft-spoken empathetic nerd.  Until you tick him off, that is.  The fight scenes are fast, brutal, and downright awesome.  They don't take up much of the  Lord of the Rings-ish running time, but they are spectacular while they last.  Doctor Manhattan essentially plays the role of God in this.  Thew actor is mostly mo-capped, but even with the complete impassivity of Manhattan's facial features, emotion leaks through.  Outstanding.  As an otherworldy being with limitless power, he is like Superman, Silver Surfer, Magneto, Professor X, and a living atom bomb all wrapped up in an exhibitionist Blue Man Group member package.  His all-knowing observations serve as a grounding point for the film's pessimistic philosophies.  The Comedian is a perpetual presence even though he dies in the opening scene.  He is arguably the scummiest of all the Watchmen, but it may turn out he was the only one who had it right after all.  He is not a comedian who tells jokes, he is a sadist whose humor includes burning people alive, raping his friends, and taking joy in the sick irony of it all.  Smartest man in the world Ozymandias plays a relatively small role in the film until the end, and then becomes crucial as the pieces fall into place.

Dr. Manhattan's creation in this story changes the course of United States history, and allows us to win the Vietnam War and re-elect a victorious Nixon many times over all the way into the 80's.  A nightmare for many people, like this movie will be.  But the end result is the same; the threat of mutual nuclear annihilation between the USA and the USSR.  But in this case, it's going down and the only being with a chance to stop it has lost any semblance of humanity and would rather watch the world die then lift a finger knowing that in the big picture, the universe wouldn't even notice either way.  The story of Watchmen is epic and philosophical in ways that standard movie-goers are simply are not going to grasp.  They will come in looking for ""BIFF!, ""POW!"", and ""OOF!"" and will leave having seen dogs fighting over a little girl's mostly skeletonized leg (shoe still on the foot), bones getting snapped in slow motion, a man getting his arms taken off with a power tool, more blue manmeat then they ever wanted to see, and the dreariest overall tone of any major studio release I've ever seen.  And I love that about it.  Hey now; mankind is portrayed as scum, brutal violence and frank sex abound, and the nerd gets the girl!  What's not to like for me?  The only real chinks I found in the armor aside from it's genuine unpalletability is the soundtrack, which consists of numerous classic songs that are all great but I felt like they really distracted me from the film and clashed with the tone, plus the excessive male full-frontal nudity which produced A LOT of audience jokes at inappropriate times, including from me.  But overall I am thrilled to see a visual dynamo like Zack Snyder doing something so bold, different, harsh, and deep so early in his career.  Pray this doesn't sink it.

So again I say, this film will be a Hindenbergian catastrophe for mainstream movie fans looking for some light popcorn-friendly entertainment or worse, kiddie-fare.  But for those of you who want real depth, an adult story that takes it's time and encompasses all that is black and depraved and hopeless in society, characters that you may not like but still gape in awe at, a serious comic adaptation that earns it's R-rating and then some, and want to see the greyest ending in film history, I give you ""Watchmen"".  Look upon it's works, ye mighty, and despair.

""In Egypt's sandy silence, all alone,
Stands a gigantic Leg, which far off throws
The only shadow that the Desert knows:

Nought but the Leg remaining to disclose
The site of this forgotten Babylon.
We wonder, and some Hunter may express
Wonder like ours, when thro' the wilderness
Where London stood, holding the Wolf in chace,
He meets some fragments huge, and stops to guess
What powerful but unrecorded race
Once dwelt in that annihilated place.""  --Horace Smith.",1236211200,11,7436,4.904

One nice thing is, it comes with the Director's Cut on Blu-Ray, as well as a third disc of extras. Now, I was a big fan of the Director's Cut. I decided to pick this up because I like when filmmakers make longer versions of movies for home release, as opposed to just putting in a deleted scenes reel. It makes it feel like you are getting a more complete version of the film.

The Ultimate Cut is nicely upscaled to 4K. The thing is, you have to have the technology to see it. I wonder if some of the reviewers complaining about the quality actually have 4K TV's players and stereo equipment. I did notice that the picture is a bit sharper, clearer and although not huge, a definite uptick in quality from the Blu-Ray.

The Tales of the Black Freighter is a story within a story. Throughout the movie, it cuts to the animated movie, which is compelling but it really has nothing to do with the story of Watchmen. When it cuts out and back in, it can be a bit disorienting. What I did like about it though is the extra scenes at the newsstand involving the old man and the kid reading the comic. You find out a bit more about them and how they fit into the Watchmen world. It also makes the New York bombing a bit more emotional.

I guess if there could be a perfect cut of the movie, it would be everything from the Ultimate Cut that was live action, leaving the animated movie separate. It really should be viewed on its own, as it adds nothing to the main movie.",1514505600,3,1662,4.168224299065421

I have had movies on disc and streamed that were sometimes  a bit hard to find a balance between too loud during action scenes and too soft during dialogue, but it has never been a real problem, more of a minor irritation.

In my case I was left at the end with the feeling I'd just seen something brilliant.  Your vision of superheroes may never be the same. Characters can be very good yet bad.  Or very bad but also good. Or even very very bad but fighting on the ""right/good"" side.  One says of another "".....he was practically a nazi"".  As disgusting as it is, are we to think, ""Yeah, but he's our nazi."" ?  One message that cannot be argued with is that, in the end, you can't fight human nature.  Utopia may be achieved.

3568410,3,B001FB55H6,"Amazon should have multiple criteria for disc reviews, as I would give the film four stars, but this release gets two from me. First, this is just a 2K version being released on the 4K platform; it did not come from a 4K scan, so it looks only marginally better than the Blu-ray. While advertised as a 4K/Blu-ray combo set, the Ultimate Cut is presented on the 4K disc, while the shorter (and frankly superior) Director's Cut is relegated to the Blu-ray. You can't get the Director's Cut on 4K. This is basically a repackaging of the Blu-ray Ultimate Cut set, though it leaves out the Watchmen Motion Comics disc that was presented with the earlier release. Annoying, but at least it doesn't claim otherwise. However, the slipcover does claim that it features two commentary tracks, one by Zack Snyder and one by Watchmen comic artist Dave Gibbons, and this is untrue. Neither commentary appears on this version; they can only be found on the previous Blu-ray version. This is false advertising, plain and simple. Perhaps someday a proper 4K release, featuring an actual 4K scan of the film, along with actual inclusion of the extras it claims to contain, will be released-I'd hold out for that. If you have the Blu-ray of the Director's Cut, there's no reason to upgrade to this version. If you have the Blu-ray of the Ultimate Cut, the only thing you are getting with this version is a mildly better picture, so decide for yourself if it's worth the price tag for that slight improvement, given that you'll need to hang onto your Blu-ray for the missing extras.

A visually stunning and robust cinematic adaptation, considering the multi-layered and complex source material.

That being said, its still quite difficult to juggle all the nuances and streamline the dense backstory of the graphic novel, leaving the film feeling somewhat disjointed.

I'd previously owned the director's cut DVD and wanted to upgrade to Bluray and get the extra movie length the ultimate cut offered. Unfortunately, there is no stand alone Bluray Ultimate Cut, but I saw that this had 4K plus Bluray.

When it arrived, I was pretty disappointed to see that the Bluray disc included was just the director's cut. So if, like me, you don't have a 4K player, just be aware that the only way you're going to be able to watch the ultimate cut is with the digital copy that is also included.",1480636800,4,597,4.330357142857143

Those looking to buy this edition (4K release) should be aware that the included Blu Ray (not 4k) disc is the Director's Cut, NOT the Ultimate Cut. Other reviews have pointed this detail out, but they tend to get buried over the however many hundreds (thousands?) of reviews of the older editions. (As i'm sure this one will. Thanks for grouping all editions together, Amazon) I want to call this false advertising, but the packaging does indicate what is on the discs. It's just that the text doing so feels small and easy to miss unless you're scrutinizing the cover.

Fortunately the included Ultraviolet copy is at least the Ultimate Cut, so those buying this without a 4K player (such as folks wanting the UC for less than $50) aren't completely out of luck.",1477958400,2,989,4.645714285714286

For those who know nothing about Watchmen, it is a film, based on a Graphic Novel that is generally considered the greatest graphic novel of all time. It was considered by many to be unfilmable, and while some may hate the way the film turned out, it is one of the most faithful adaptations ever made from a novel.
It is very dark, very violent, and definitely NOT FOR CHILDREN.

It follows the source material almost faithfully, but there are minor and one sort-of major change from the book to the movie. If you read the graphic novel by Alan Moore, you will definitely be able to pinpoint all of these changes but it's not too bothersome. Quite on the contrary, the changes are actually better, because they make more sense and it's more believable. There are criticisms, such as the plot being too complicated or too violent, which is absurd. Like the complaint about the violence. It's rated R for a reason. Any scene with Rorschach is very violent, ESPECIALLY the prison scene. And about that plot being too complicated? I don't get that. My friend who knew nothing of the Watchmen, never heard of it, much less read it. And he knew EXACTLY what was happening. It's complex, but to say it's convoluted and makes no sense is just stupid. The plot is actually really simple. Someone is killing the costumed heroes, and they (Rorschach, Nite Owl and Silk Spectre) try to figure out who's behind it, but discovers a much more sinister conspiracy.",1462665600,2,1245,4.715596330275229

I remember really liking it, and--in the face of Zack Snyder's recent fair--I wanted to double check if the movie actually held up. Well...it sort of holds-up, but it also sort of doesn't. Aside from the opening sequence, the action is not as creative as I remember, and in fact seems excessive at times. The use of flashbacks is borderline obnoxious, especially during the funeral. The overall message of the film is muddled and unclear; most of the heroes come off more like villains than vigilantes in the grey spectrum. And the make-up in this film is not very good (especially Nixon). However, I have just as many positive things to say about the film as I do negative. The concepts that the movie conveys are ambitious. Dr. Manhattan is the most intriguing character ever put to screen. The actual film looks great, the framing, the colors, and the staging are all on point (especially during some of the slow motion sequences). Jackie Earle Haley turns in a terrific performance as Rorschach. And the last 20 minutes of the movie is thematically very strong. Though I want to ding the film hard for its shortcomings, there is too much here that I like. The good outweighs the bad for me.

Where ever you do fall you will have to understand that this is one of those indefinable movies that can take you on a thrill ride or bore you to death. I for one found the movie an interesting look into the human psyche and without sounding too Freudian it was amazing.

He has a daughter and that's nothing to joke around about, life itself is sacred.

3571073,4,B001FB55H6,This was an interesting film with an original concept done well. There is a very titillating sex scene that is nevertheless only-R rated. It isn't gratuitous but for those who are very conservative in their concepts of sexuality it's quite shocking. The ending is surprising and quite good.,1456531200,,290,5.0625
3571074,5,B001FB55H6,"A brilliant film that launches an extreme conservative, even at times Calvinistic, critiquing of society in the late 20th, and now 21st, century America, that nonetheless manages to masquerade as a post-modernistic one.  From the very first punch thrown, through the romance, the kisses, the fights, through the lies and intimidation to the last bite of a cheeseburger, the ""Watchmen"" presents an alternative reality in which superheroes try to prevent the disintegration of the United States, as well as that of the world.  This results in a burlesquing of modernity, as well as a reasonably formal appraisal of it.  A triumph for director Zach Snyder, and writer Alan Moore.

I heard that the ending was changed from what it was in the comics.  Be this as it may, I thought it good, and successful, and consistent with the movie as a whole.  However, the whole movie was so excellent it left my tongue a little dry.  I actually sort of wanted more.  Perhaps it was the post-modernistic element of it; I don't know.  But though it was philosophical, it could have even launched more vigorously in this direction, I suppose.  And some matters are left unexplained: such as, just who the Watchmen are, and where they came from.

The reason why I do not consider this really 'post-modernistic' is that it has a sense of justice pervading the movie, which was never truly altered, and that, secondly, it did ultimately leave open the possibility of God existence.  While their were characters and individuals about that led you to wonder about His existence, it was never denied or even aspersed.  And we have 'characters and individuals about, even now, that...'would leave one to wonder.'  A true post-modernistic film, if it addressed the issue, would deny ultimate truth.  I believe it may be the sense of ethics which carries the film away from being considered one of this field. ... Even the speculation by the Comedian (one of the Watchmen), that the American dream came true, is hardly inconsistent with a Judeo-Christian viewing of 20th/21st century America.

In conclusion... This is an unquestionably great film: for adults, and collegians....  Highly recommended.  We can all form our own opinions of the Watchmen, of who they were, and of reality: there is much that was left open.  The music is outstanding.",1456531200,,2319,4.945736434108527

It stands out as being far different from any other movie in the genre.
I have seen this film get some rather tepid reviews and I have to strongly disagree with that sentiment.  I saw this film 3 times when it was originally released and made sure that I purchased a copy when it became available on the home market.  I have seen this move many times and it never gets old to me.  After watching the film again at home I was inspired to read the stellar graphic novel.

The movie is visually impressive and its scale is epic while maintaining a grip on the characters inner struggles. It is long, and sometimes the dialogue is a little cheesy and the recounted exposition a tad clumsy, but its never tedious. Snyder, Hayter, and Tse have succeeded, for the most part, in adapting what I gather is difficult source material into an utterly compelling movie.

I even didn't mind the pace, which was slower than a normal Holllywood film and, to me, is more aligned with indie or foreign film dramas. It just fell flat with me. Their art didn't elicit me to  care about the characters, nor their plights, and because of this the particular world that was constructed I had no emotional attachment to. Without this it felt like a visual text book rather than a graphic novel. A text book on just informational subject matter-a how to-not a rich history or science one.

Additionally, the top right corner of the back portion of the case was cracked.

The Blu-Ray case was actually hollow in the back (you can touch the paper behind the disk), which most likely contributed to the damage. I didn't return it because I was having a viewing party that night, and the disks weren't damaged (which is what mattered, in the scheme of things).

Stark was not quite as ego-centric, but extremely flawed and not nearly as ""fun"" in the original comics as the Iron Man movie portrays him. It's not fair to judge these movies that way. Writers have altered characters over the years (even Alan Moore with these). They're a snapshot of the time period the were written. They're sometimes meant as a commentary on real life events. It's not uncommon that the characters change/mature.

3571541,3,B001FB55H6,"I loathed the film the first time I saw it, liked it the second time, and I was awed by the third time.

It is a very long film, almost three hours long.  And though I do like it, it did feel long.

The fight scenes are insipid - Silk Spectre II/Laurie Jupiter/ Malin kerman and Nite Owl II/ Patrick Wilson couldn't defeat a six-year with a white belt in karate.  But they were compelling characters, sincere, and wanting to do good.

It opens well.  Love the complexities of the era, and each superhero's stories.  You sensed Ozymndias/Adrian Veidt/Matthew Goode's prowess and intelligence, and Rorschach/Walter Kovacs/Jackie Earle Haley's need to believe.  He is the star of the film.  Though most of the film had his face covered, he clearly evinced the depravity of his youth, his complete lack of fear, and his devotion to good, though it might do further harm than good.

I hated and could not understand all of it.  How the Silk Spectre/Sally Jupiter/Carla Gugino could have sex toward a man who tried to rape her was incomprehensible to me.  He was supposed to be a superhero, and he sunk into a evil.  It was clear he was a broken man.

I like the vision of this film.  The alternative reality featured.  It was very long, but you had to have patience, and by having patience, you could enjoy the film.",1439078400,,1311,4.538461538461538

With a 1940s feel set in the 70s and 80s, The Watchmen, clocking in at 2:20, is by no means a kid's comic book superhero story.  Yes, this was a graphic novel (comic book), and yes, there are superheroes, but they aren't all warm and fuzzy and blowing rainbows out of the rear ends of unicorns.

The Watchmen was collectively a group devoted to keeping mankind safe.  Several members of the group had grown further and further away, one from mankind itself, the other in miles - down to Antarctica.  One of the Watchmen, The Comic, was killed in his own home while watching ""Richard Nixon"" on television.  This sparks a little outrage from another who immediately sets to uncovering the plot to destroy the superheroes.

3571965,5,B001FB55H6,"After the Comedian has been murdered, lone remaining vigilante Rorschach begins an investigation into his old acquaintances death. Since most superheroes were banned from existing after some legislation several years before, he looks up old allies and even old enemies in his quest for the truth. Slowly, he begins to unravel a plot that could bring about a disaster unlike anything the world has ever seen before.

Based on what some would argue is the greatest graphic novel and superhero story of all time, Watchmen written by Alan More and Dave Gibbons, this movie adaptation was years in the making. Not this specific rendition, but from what I know, the book was optioned way back when it came out in the 80s but never got off the ground. One of the reasons was very few filmmakers had the guts to touch it because Watchmen is such a revered work amongst comic fans and even in some literary and academic circles.

Enter director Zack Snyder (Dawn of the Dead (2004), Man of Steel, 300 and more), whose eye for detail and a knack for visual storytelling takes on the gargantuan project and does his best to faithfully adapt Watchmen to the big screen. Him and his creative team nail it, in my opinion, and adapt the book the only way something like Watchmen could be adapted: panel-by-panel. It was the safest route but also the smartest. Some changes were madelike the endingbut for the most part, the book is translated completely as is to the big screen. Even the directors cut includes additional scenes and animated clips from Tales of the Black Freighter interspersed throughout just like the graphic novel has bits of the pirate comic peppered throughout the main narrative.

Watchmen asks the question: what would superheroes be like if they existed in the real world? Whether they are of the superpowerless variety or something more Superman-like ala Dr. Manhattan, you get an honest portrayal of superheroes in real life, all centered around the mystery of the murder of one of their friends.

This story is about as down-to-earth as you get regarding superheroes in real life, and depending on the angle you're coming from, can be equal to or more so than Kick-Ass in that regard.

Each character in the flick matched their character in the book, all the way from the crazy-yet-cynical Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), to black-and-white-justice-seeking Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), to idealistic-yet-obsessed Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson), to insecure-but-strong Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman), to misguided-but-you-can-see-how-hes-right Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), and a supporting cast that makes every moment believable.

The Watchmen story is so dense that the fact they were able to take the twelve-part series and showcase nearly all of it in around three and a half hoursIm talking about the ultimate cut of the movie, which includes Tales of the Black Freighter and a bunch of additional footage not seen in the theatrical releaseis pretty impressive. Whats amazing about the Watchmen narrative and thus the movie is the incredible amount of history for the characters that needed to be shown without bogging down the main story, which was the Comedians murder. You get to know these characters intimately, their pasts, their present and in some cases, their future.

Zack Snyders knack for visuals gave this flick its own flavor and tone thanks to the color filters on the film. The score is fantastic. The action scenes were well done and quickly-paced, using brutal fighting techniques and the right amount of blood.

Watchmen is certainly not your traditional superhero flick. Its a superhero drama and is meant for an audience who likes to have some thinking along with their superhero slugfests. As a comic book fan, I appreciated the movies faithfulness to the graphic novel, the overall story of Watchmen, and how each person involved really seemed to take this movie seriously. Nothing was tongue-in-cheek.

Watchmen ranks right up there as one of the greatest superhero movies of all time. If you consider yourself a superhero fan, then you should check it out. Its a serious look at the genre through the lens of a clever story with amazing characters, all of which you feel like youve known for ages instead of just for a few hours on the screen.

Highly recommended. Not for kids.",1430179200,,4318,5.0013927576601676

I actually used the character descriptions on IMDB to get a better understanding of their motivations and the plot overall. That helped a lot. But I still feel a little ill-equipped to be fair about this, despite loving other graphic novel-themed movies like Sin City, Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill.

3572125,4,B001FB55H6,"Watchmen

 This is a giant movie.  It runs almost three hours and they spent a reported $150 million to produce it.  It is huge in its concept, brilliant in its production, disturbing in its content and ultimately pointless.  But what an interesting, invigorating and intensely absorbing film.
 I won't say much about the story except that it happens in an alternate universe from the 1940s to the mid 1980s during the later of five presidential terms for Richard Nixon.  The movie is structured around a murder with a back ground of imminent thermo nuclear war between the US and an undefeated USSR.  The protagonists are the remnants of a group of masked crime fighters-Watchmen- who are trying to discover the reason for the murder of one of their number.  The film is based on a graphic novel (comic book for adults).
 Of the five masked crusaders, one is a brilliant, megalomaniac mass murderer and two more are psychopaths.  The film is rated R for horrid violence and near porno quality sex scenes.  The last two crime fighters are nice, crusader next door folk that we can identify with without endangering our souls.  One character has mysteriously obtained powers so great as to remove the distinction between man and God.  Trying to interest him in saving mere mankind occupies a lot of screen time.
 The super man type character, or Blue Jesus as my genius son calls him, is so close to deification that cosmic questions are broached at least twice during the film.  When you ask the audience the Big Question-Whats it all about anyway?-you should have a better answer than Who Knows? And Who Cares? isn't a better answer.  Did I say this was based on a comic book?  Maybe Im expecting too much.
 This is NOT just some super hero flick like X-Men or The Fabulous Four or even last years Hulk and Ironman.  It is innovative, spectacular and in its limited way, thoughtful.  If you can stand the realistic violence-committed by the good guys and aren't going to surprised by the sex scenes, go see it.  Four Saw Blades.",1425600000,2,2029,4.704545454545454

I think Patrick Wilson was miscast--Nite Owl II was a pudgy, insecure scientists.  But the rest of the cast is terrific.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan was dead-on as The Comedian.  While there's an Academy bias against ""comic book movies"" Jackie Earle Haley should have at least been nominated for best supporting actor for his portrayal of Rorschach.

But seriously... they didn't pull many punches (so to speak) or try to water down the graphic novel, and that made what could have been a disasterous translation of the epic graphic novel instead a film that I ended up buying and have watched many times. I recommend this one without hesitation to any friends who are fans of the author's work. It's a bit of a tough sell to other folks, I've found, and most, after viewing, didn't ""get it"".

My personal opinion is that it's a really good movie- the dialogue and visual effects are incredible. My nitpick is the confusing sequence of flashbacks and their placement throughout the movie, not being entirely sure of what's going on at times, and for someone whose never read the comics it's difficult to understand the plot- there seems to be several of them.

There surely is a bright blue distraction on more than one occasion- I find myself unable to focus on what people are saying because I have my attention drawn to it. It's an interesting turn, treating male nudity as female nudity has been treated for decades, but it's something to adjust to.

It's a bit lacking in re-watch-ability, but definitely worth seeing once.  It's also complex enough that paying close attention is important.

While some people didn't enjoy the film adaption of Moore's classic graphic novel, I can not see why. I loved every part of this movie. However, many of the films more violent scenes are extended in this version of the movie.

The story (which is mostly from the book) is fantastic.  I felt the part they changed made it perhaps easier for a movie goer to understand.  The sets, acting, and makeup were all good (IMHO).

The rest of the movie follows the arch of the cult-classic graphic novel to painstaking detail. This attention to detail is both good and bad. The movie can drag on and while it's nice to see the characters brought to life, (particularly Jackie Earl Haley's Rorsach, Cruddup's Dr. Manhattan, and Wilson's Nite Owl), some of the actors fail to make the characters pop (see: Malin Ackerman's Silk Spectre and Goode's Ozymandias). Overall it is a faithful cinematic take on an incredibly daft graphic novel--for better and for worse.",1403740800,,713,4.900826446280992
3573033,5,B001FB55H6,"If you want to truly spoil yourself with an experience you will refer back to throughout your life, then before just instantly gratifying yourself by watching this movie, get the graphic novel first.  Lucky for you it's all been compiled into one book and you don't have to wait every month for the next issue to come out like I did in the 80s.  You can even buy it on demand here on Amazon.

This is not your traditional superhero movie.  That's part of why it is so dark and edgy.  It's about broken down heros who are middle aged and live through reminiscing about their glory days, enemies who are now friends with terminal illnesses, the new generation coming into their own, and the unbridled ambition of those who found success from their past.

That's just one facet of this story, which takes place in an alternative history where Nixon is still President and the wheels of progress have nearly spun off the wagon.

This is by far Zach Snyder's best film.  It's a faithful, downright devout treatment of the original material.  Like most films, it was controversial when released with people loving or hating it.  I think those that hated it never really read the books.  For me this movie was just as impactful as the titular epics of our time:  2001, Star Wars, the Matrix, and Lord of the Rings.  Everytime I watch it I can see a new movie, I come to new conclusions about the characters, I can see the nuance and the detail and it's brilliantly crafted film in nearly every respect.  This movie isn't about the special effects or action, it's about the thematic landscape thats presented in this alternative history and these characters trying to find purpose within it.

After the slow beginning of the story the character interactions, the action, and the drama had me totally hooked -- particularly in the second half.  I found myself re-experiencing Moore's graphic novel.

The action scenes of Watchmen are choreographed in bone-crushing visual clarity and, at the time and year of its release, I thought it had some of the most brutal sequences I have ever encountered for a superhero movie. It had certainly earned its R rating for its extreme violence (Rorschach for an example)  and also because its adult material (Dr. Manhattan's nudity and other controversial content).  the Watchman is not your normal superhero movie, nor was Moore's graphic novel your normal superhero comic for that matter.

Anyway, I enjoyed Zack Snyder's ambitious efforts on the film and doubt anyone will ever come as close to adapting Moore's Watchmen as well as he has done it.",1402099200,,989,5.0060975609756095

This film seems addressed to those of us who lived through the days of Vietnam and war protestors, yet makes itself accessible to others by taking an abrupt right turn into an alternate universe early in the film.

There are plenty of extras, the best of the bunch being the Maximum Movie Mode which has director Zack Snyder taking you through nearly every facet of the film's travel to the screen and production, which is probably worth the cost of the disc alone. The movie itself may polarize viewers (actually scratch that, it WILL) and fans of the graphic novel itself but this is most likely the best adaptation of the source we will ever get. I commend Snyder for his work on this film as it seems he has given the film his all and it really shows. Yeah there are problems with it and some stuff just doesn't translate well to the big screen (there's a love scene in this that's just flat out awful) but the film gets way more right than it does wrong. Jackie Earle Haley alone makes this movie worth sitting through for his on the nose portrayal of the unhinged vigilante Rorschach.

Watchmen might not be pitch perfect but it's better than many detractors give it credit for and more thoughtful and meaningful than your average superhero film.",1400198400,4,1177,4.604761904761904

Zack Snyder doesn't have too good a of a reputation, especially after ""Man of Steel"". However, like 300 before it, Wtchmen is a beautifully adapted version of one of the most politically driven Graphic novels of modern times.

With outstanding performances from the entire cast, as well as stunning stunt and camera coordination. Watchmen is a must see for any who wonder, ""what if a few, took an extraordinary stand against corruption.""",1394409600,,654,4.728070175438597

3573229,4,B001FB55H6,"I really don't get all the criticism toward this film.  I thought it was great.  Watchmen is based on a graphic novel written in 1995.  It is largely considered a groundbreaking story.  It's the first time someone really showed the dark side of flawed super hero's and how they could become hated by the public.  Having anti-hero's now is pretty commonplace, but you can see Watchman's influence.  That's the first thing I thought of when I saw The Incredibles.
 The story takes place in an alternate reality.  Through some early scenes and flashbacks, we see that hero's were commonplace for a time, but people rebelled against them.  The government basically outlawed ""masked"" hero's and forced them to retire.  Most of the movie takes place during the Cold War where the threat of nuclear war looms large.  A group of retired hero's, remnants of the Watchmen, find they are needed again after one of their own is murdered.
  After having read the novel, I thought the film captured it well and stuck pretty close to the material.  I liked the characters and the action scenes were terrific.  The costumes differed from the book quite a bit, but it actually became a plus. I thought costumes of the modern age Watchmen were some of the best I have ever seen in a movie.  Loved the fighting scenes.  Great choreography.
 Of course, the movie isn't without fault.  I thought seeing Dr. Mahattan in all his glory was way over done.  I didn't need to see his manhood constantly on the screen.  Some of the music was annoying and didn't always fit.  They changed the ending for some reason, but It didn't kill the film.  Extremely gory and graphic at times.  A few of the acting performance are sub par.
 Overall, this is a great movie.  The Director's cut also gives you some extra scenes that are really quite good.  The picture quality is fantastic.",1393891200,,1849,4.679127725856698

Dr. Manhattan has got to be the most powerful ""super hero"" in all of existence. Here's a guy that can manipulate the atomic structure of things.

When these are unraveled, tidied up and laid end to end, their mystery disappears. I especially missed the Black Freighter thread, which was such a bizarre adjunct to the main story.

Watchmen's black freighter story was great as a comic in a comic but here Zack turns it into a bloated overstated rambling mess of an animation within a plagiarism of a comic book. So you see whats wrong right there.

There are too few cool synchronistic moments from the comic, and too many gory mean add ons, as if the original story wasn't mean gritty and violent enough.

This film is often maligned by fans of the originals as well as those who have no particular grounding in Moore's work. It has been panned both by ""comic book"" fans and ""laymen"" alike.

3573706,4,B001FB55H6,"I read the comic/book a year or so before the movie came out. It is a masterpiece and perhaps the most engrossing, deep and complex comic I have read. I didn't have decades of built up love and admiration for it so I feel I was able to watch the movie without the prejudice and hatred some die hards have for the film. The movie had no chance of matching the depth and commentary (on comics and the world) that the book was able to deliver and I am okay with that. Justice could only truly be done to this story on HBO. For the approximately three hours Snyder has to work with he delivers the boiled down essence of the story.

What works:

The opening credits montage is just brilliant. It is the history of the Watchmen world told in stunning imagery with the perfect tone of nostalgia, lost innocence and post-war Americana. The credits lead us from the 1940's through the 1980's. It is only five or so minutes long but is worth three stars on it's own. I pop the Blu-ray in to watch the opening from time to time.

Similarly, the origin story of Dr. Manhattan is spot on. You feel the transformation from a man to something alien and god-like. There is love, fear, sadness, regret - essentially an entire movie worth of story compressed into the timeframe of a music video. I could have watched just the Dr. Manhattan story and been satisfied.

Rorschach is perfectly cast and comes across true to the book.

Visuals are Zack Snyder's forte and this movie is great to look at even with the sound off. He mimics many shots directly from the comic drawings/panels and in general knows the visual language needed for a superhero story.

What doesn't work:

The ending didn't need to be altered from the book to be effective.

Ozymandias seemed miscast and weak - not enough screen presence or menace.

The sex scene set to Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen was cringeworthy.

The fight scenes were too choreographed and cinematic. There was no sense that these were amateurs playing at being heroes. Instead, they felt like comic heroes from the DC universe at the top of their game which they are most decidedly not supposed to be.

Overall:

This is a solid movie that works more as a visual companion to the book. If watched on its own merits without having read the book it may feel more like an overstuffed tale with too many characters that is trying to do too much at one time.",1379116800,17,2380,4.483796296296297

You can't shake a stick at a movie theater these days without pointing out some shlock where people fight in the rain -- that, or where something blows up behind them while they walk casually away, or where they leap headfirst away from an exploding something or other. . . . But I digress. I loved Watchmen. It was mature. The characters were complex. There were gray moral issues instead of just black and white ones. And it wasn't wall-to-wall action; they actually had a few slow moments to allow us to take a breath, which has the effect of making the action all that more memorable. The story was also morally ambiguous in some ways: you have to give kudos to a movie that has the balls to show a pregnant woman getting blown away in during the Vietnam War.

Forewarning: I have never read the Watchmen graphic novel.  I saw the original showing of this film opening night with some fellow college roommates and absolutely loved it at the time.  Other than that one viewing in 2009, up until now I've only ever seen TV rebroadcasts of the movie, which are obviously censored to some degree.  This director's cut has everything that the theatrical release had, plus many scenes that were cut to keep the theatrical runtime under 3 hours.  There's only one ""new"" scene that I felt was completely pointless; all others added further depth to the Watchmen universe to great benefit.

3573968,4,B001FB55H6,"Before purchasing Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut, I read up on all the different version available, particularly the theatrical cut and the director's cut. The general consensus seems to be that the best version was the director's cut. It restores a number of scenes that had been cut from the original release, adding more depth to the characters. Many felt that The Ultimate Cut took things too far by mixing in scenes from Tales of the Black Freighter. It makes the movie much longer and breaks up the rhythm of the live action sequences. I expected to feel the same way, but I didn't. Upon viewing this in its most epic version, I found it to be the best, fullest translation of the original graphic novel.

For one thing, I enjoyed the sheer length of it, the degree to which the viewer is plunged into this fascinating world, immersing oneself in the history, characters, and visuals. For another, the graphic novel itself had a broken flow to it, ending each chapter with special sections, mixing in the Black Freighter sequences. Adding those scenes into this version gave me that same sense and tone of the reading experience.

You've probably at least seen the theatrical release and have read the graphic novel if you're looking into buying the Ultimate Cut, so I won't discuss the plot at all. Suffice it to say, it's very rich and fascinating, bringing up ideas that linger long after the movie ends. The visuals are great, and acting is excellent, with the exception of Malin Akerman as the Silk Spectre II. She's subpar (to be kind) but doesn't ruin the movie. It's just a shame that she couldn't be on the level of the other actors, particularly Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl.

The extended film is the primary reason to invest in this set, but there's also the motion comic, which is a nice, if unnecessary addition, and some good extras. Overall, I'm very pleased with this set. For some, it'll be too much, and they would likely be best served by the director's cut. Nothing wrong with that. But for me, the ultimate cut lives up to its name.",1373846400,3,2054,4.652892561983471
3573969,5,B001FB55H6,"If you want the most Watchman you can possibly get this is the set to get!

It is the fullest most complete version of the film and really adds layers to the story about what makes a Hero and what makes a Villain and how the line between the two, is hard to find.

And the additional comic book animated into a 3-4 hour straight from the book cartoon is a good way to get into the source material even if it looks kinda silly sometimes. Its an even vaster story with all the super nerd details you might be looking for.

The only thing that i say needs help is the damn commentary track. There is only the Director Commentary with Zack S. and he might be a great director but to be honest he sounds like some young kid who is totally unsure of himself, stumbling through sentences and chattering aimlessly about one thing or another giving no real insight into the material whatsoever.

Unless you like listening to what sounds like some awkward highschool kid going 'Like' and 'Umm' a thousand times in 3 hours don't bother getting this one for the commentary.

3574001,3,B001FB55H6,"So, this is going to be a tricky review to write. I was really caught in between really liking this movie and feeling indifferent towards it. There were a few moments where, if I didn't already know the ending, I would have been genuinely surprised by what happened. Even with that spoiled for me, I still enjoyed the movie and I still really disliked it. So let's break it down into two categories here.

Liked it:
- The effects were amazing.
- It was very stylish (I expected no less.)
- Jackie Earle Haley was a great Rorschach.
- Night Owl had his charm and Dr. Manhattan was interesting.
- The overall plot, being based on the book, I felt was well done for a film adapations.

Hated it:
- Silk Spectre was more of a sex object than an actual heroine. Malin Akerman's sex scene just devalued the character for me as a whole, because she doesn't really do anything else. She's very one note and feels very helpless.
- There is surprisingly little action. More time is spent investigating the Comedian's death rather than focusing on any fight scenes. I didn't feel that this was balanced well in terms of action and plot.
- The film was just too gory in a way that made it feel unnecessary. Now I don't dislike gore, after all I loved the new Dredd movie. But in this movie, I just didn't see the purpose in watching arms being broken with fountains of blood gushing out.
- The Ozymandias casting choice didn't work for me, or maybe it was the costume. Whatever it was, I didn't enjoy watching him on screen nor did I think the actor did a particular good job for it.
- The movie was long, but unlike Lord of the Rings I could -feel- that the movie was long.

Overall, as someone who has not read the comic books. It's definitely a movie that will keep you interested, but it's not exactly a film that you're going to come out and say I LOVED THIS MOVIE. It's tepid at its worst and entertaining at its best, but the weak characterization of Silk Spectre and the general lack of super heroics makes it difficult to recommend watching this movie. If you find yourself bored one day, feel free to give this a shot, it will certainly pass the time.",1372550400,2,2149,4.3675

Without that why should we even care what happens to the superheros? As we've now seen with Man of Steel, 300, and Sucker Punch, he adds in a bunch of flash backs and goes off on random tangents that just confuse the audience. Sure some of the special effects are cool, but they only get you so far. If he actually put time into capturing emotion and adding things in that make the audience care then I think he could actually make some good films, but right now I feel like he should be down on the TV show level. He should take notes from David Goyer and Christopher Nolan, they know how to add heart to a film! Definitely not worth the purchase!

The characters (whom you are supposed to already know and realize their super powers) were such flawed and awful people, you have to be crazy to feel any kind of sadness when they are killed.  And of course there are pointless, naked sex scenes in there as if they are a requisite part of film making or something.  Absolutely ridiculous.  Bad acting topped everything off.  It was like 300 based in the 1980s.  Such a waste of time and money.  Very, very confusing as to how people got paid for this movie and how this guy got chosen to direct the Man of Steel movie.  Even more baffling is that they are using his name in the trailers of that upcoming film to try and sell the film.

It felt like half the movie was left on the editing room floor with too much detail missing. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad the movie wasn't any longer, but it was hard to get invested in the players as we didn't feel like we even got to know them. The Cold War theme felt stagnant as well.

Its nice to watch a few times, but I you really feel that 3hr run time and it makes the whole movie feel too long.

I won't review the film, you KNOW the film if you're perusing this page already. If you love 'V for Vendetta' and 'From Hell' well... I'm pretty sure you have an open mind and love challenging films - this is one of those type of films - challenging in many ways, theory, philosophy, people, abstracts, pop culture, power madism, grunge, holistic unholyisms etc.

Alas, I WILL comment on the GOUGHING GREEDINESS currently on display here by  GottaSeeOdyssey trying to ripoff people at $149+!! Oh yeah... If you're an Amazon Prime member you get Free Shipping - WHAT A DEAL eh?

Loved how each of their back stories trickled out. The ""comic book"" style violence could be disturbing for some.

the few flaws I found with the original cut are fixed here. And any plot holes the original cut had are gone. If you Love The WATCHMEN book and you liked or loved & even if you found the original cut lacking this is for you.

It's worth it just for the death of Hollis Mason scene.

Even a non-comic book fan , could find enjoyment with this film and still be left with a need for more.

1. Each character served an excellent purpose!
2. Most of the actors were great with their characters!
3. They got down most of the major details from the graphic novel!
 Most of them...
4. The entire movie had a nice, dark, brooding mood to it!
5. The movie gave us viewers some nice twists on historical moments (the famous
kissing photo from the end of the war, President Kennedy being killed,
Studio 54, etc.)
6. The costumes were well designed!
7. Rorchact (did I spell his name right?) was definitely the best character in
the movie, and one of the best characters ever created for the DC universe!
8. The visual effects were stunning and wonderful!
9. I like how they gave other actors a chance at playing the title roles and
not too many over famous people!
And finally...
10. They said this graphic novel could not be made into a movie in our lifetime,
boy were they wrong (who ever said it...)!

What I didn't like was:
1. If they had done two, possibly three movies of Watchmen they could have given us
more detail to each of the main characters!

I sall this movie on opening night and loved it! But this is

There is lots of action and lots of battles.  But evil is not defeated and good does not triumph.  In the end, there is, however, world peace.  But how we get from beginning to end is one long, twisting, and confusing narrative.  Someone is murdering a bunch of retired superheroes.  That's so he can keep secret his plan to nuke Manhattan and kill 15 million people for the greater good.  He wants to frame one of the superheroes.  That way, the Russian and American hawks threatening World War III will have a common enemy and become friends.  And when Manhattan is vaporized, everyone will also feel bad.  So, by killing millions of people, he is actually saving the world.  It works.  And we live happily ever after.  You probably think that I didn't like this movie.  But no, this is an excellent film.  It is one of those films you can't help but love.  Not because of the story that is told, obviously, but because of how it's told.  That's why I watch it again and again.  It's an experience.

3574555,5,B001FB55H6,"Based on Alan Moore's graphic novel, 2009's ""Watchmen"" takes place in an alternative 1985 where Nixon is serving his fifth term and costumed vigilantism is illegal. A former masked crimefighter named The Comedian is murdered, prompting his previous teammates to investigate the crime. Things get complicated as the backstories of most of the Watchmen are revealed and worldwide nuclear war looms.

For some reason I was never interested in the Watchmen and therefore never read the graphic novel, even though I had the opportunity. Why? The fact that it took place in an alternative reality turned me off, as did the peculiarities of the team members, which Moore intended as satire, I later discovered. That said, this is mind-blowing. ""Watchmen"" is an adult-oriented superhero flick with a convoluted plot, strong characters and total originality. The latter two score high marks with me any day.

Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) stands out with his gravelly voice and extreme right-wing ideology, although he's not very likable. He's impressive yet, at the same time, kind of pathetic. The character was based on Steve Ditko's The Question.

The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) exudes great charisma and is reminiscent of The Punisher, if he were a jokester. Unfortunately, The Comedian's arrogant & hotheaded and has a weakness towards the ladies, not to mention cold-blooded murder.

Night Owl (Patrick Wilson) is another strong character, obviously based on Batman or Blue Beetle. Unlike the previous two he's very likable. I always thought his costume looked really lame in the graphic novel but, as depicted in the film, it kicks axx.

Dr. Manhattan (Greg Plitt), named for the Manhattan Project and based on Captain Atom with a dash of Mr. Fantastic, is an almost God-like being who can do pretty much anything. He's so detached from the human experience that he walks around totally nude and has no time for his woman, Silk Spectre II. He'd rather hang out on Mars -- literally!

Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) stands out due to her sexy costume more than anything else, not to mention Akerman's drop-dead-gorgeous looks. The character was based on Phantom Lady and Black Canary. Silk can't handle Dr. Manhattan's increasing aloofness and consequently diverts to Night Owl for human warmth.

Silk Spectre (Carla Gugino) is Silk Spectre II's mother and has a pretty significant part. Like her daughter, she's hot, albeit in a whole different way.

Ozzyosbourne, whoops, I mean Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) is the least developed character and loosely based on Charlton Comic's Thunderbolt. He's ultra-smart, ultra-quick and kinda foppish.

Another highlight is the hypnotic score by Tyler Bates mixed with a quality soundtrack (e.g. ""The Sound of Silence,"" ""All Along the Watchtower,"" etc.)

BOTTOM LINE: The film is long, dark, mature, dialogue-driven and convoluted, but the strong characters and originality win the day. No moronic ""blockbuster"" trash here. Not to mention Silk Spectre II and her mother are extremely easy on the eyes. As far as superhero flicks go, there's really nothing else like ""Watchmen."" It's even more atypical than the X-Men and easily one of my favorite superhero flicks, maybe even THE favorite. ""Watchmen"" is like the ""Apocalypse Now"" of superhero films!

COMPARING CUTS: I own both the theatrical cut and Director's Cut. Although the theatrical version is just fine, the DC is worthwhile for extended dialogue to existing scenes in the theatrical cut; the biggest addition is an attack on Night Owl's Mentor, Hollis Mason, at the hands of a thug gang and Night Owl's subsequent brutal revenge at a bar. Despite the convoluted plot, I had no problem following the story in the theatrical cut, even though I've never read the graphic novel. The filmmakers did an excellent job cutting out the fat in the theatrical version, so to speak. So don't think you'll need to purchase the DC to understand the story; it's not necessary. My recommendation is to check out the theatrical version first and only purchase the DC if the theatrical cut left you wanting even more, which is what it did for me. Even so, I PREFER the theatrical cut; it's leaner and just all-around better.

The master copy of this movie should be burned and all copies of it should be collected up and destroyed to rid the world of this garbage.  Yes, it is that bad.  Story?  There is no story.  First it was a murder mystery, then it was about a doomsday clock and possible nuclear war, then it was about the world's richest man, then it was a ""superhero origins"" story, then it was a love story, then for 5 minutes it was a superhero movie, then it was a softcore sex movie with superheroes having graphic sex on a flying ship, then it was... well, NOTHING.  It was always about nothing.  The action scenes?  Horrible!  Poorly choreographed, poorly shot, poorly edited.  Just atrociously bad and also filled with cringe-worthy and unnecessary blood, bone-breaking and gore.  Not exciting or fun to watch at all.  The soundtrack/music?  Probably the worst in movie history.  Your brain will go numb from the stupidity of the music selection and matching of music to scenes in this so-called movie.  The cinematography?  Horrific.  Again, just totally stupid and lame uses of slow motion and dumb gimmicky camera work.  The direction?  The director, Zack Snyder, is the WORST director in the world hands down.  This guy ruins every single movie he gets his hands on.  This guy shouldn't be directing Saturday morning cartoons let alone major motion pictures.  He's beyond horrible!!!  He has no talents for directing movies at all.  The actors?  All no name actors.  I didn't recognize any of them.  I'm guessing every big name actor in Hollywood heard Zack Snyder was directing the movie and turned it down because they all know what a bad director he is so the producers had to cast no name actors in the movie.  Oh, and the kicker, yeah, one of the ""heroes"" in this movie... ?  Shoots and kills a pregnant girl on purpose and then later viciously beats another girl and tries to rape her.  Plus there's a scene of a little murdered girl's body being torn apart by dogs and another extremely graphic scene of a man's arms being cut off.  Yeah, great movie, Zack Snyder.

3574586,1,B001FB55H6,"I'll be honest.  I was intrigued by this film from the opening credits.  Everything seemed like it was going to make an interesting viewing, but alas that turned out not to be the case.  As I mentioned, the opening credits fascinated me in a way, because they presented us with an alternate reality that was going to inhabit the film.  Music, images, editing...everything was going well, and then the movie started.  This is the third film by Zack Snyder, and the only one I actually finished watching or rather forced myself to finish watching, hoping there's some sort of a point to it all.  If you haven't guessed it by now, the answer is NO!  THERE IS NO POINT!  This is a very long, boring slog of a movie, that is shot like a slow-mo music video.  The film is shot in dark and murky colors, forcing me to squint quite a bit in order to make out what's happening on screen.  Overuse of slow motion, incoherent plotting, endless special effects and odd musical design of this picture contributed to it's failure, but not as much as the excessive violence.  At a certain point, my brain shut down on trying to figure out what's going on, and began to dread the next blood soaked set piece.  I have nothing against violence in films, however, I hate it when it's excessive.  Numerous limbs are broken, heads split, faces bitten off and arms cut off by a circular saw.  Overall, this film is full of needless excesses, which do not, I repeat, do not come together as a coherent whole.

I walked out on Snyder's remake of Dawn Of The Dead, because of it's violence, checked out of his 300, about 20 minutes into it, because of it's overkill of special effects, which should have prepared me for Watchmen.  He does have a strong visual sense, but goes way overboard with it.  Overall, this is a terrible waste of time that will leave you angry and depressed. There's nothing to be gained here, so skip Watchmen and rent or buy something worth your while.  V for Vendetta, perhaps?",1333670400,6,1979,4.51123595505618
3574587,3,B001FB55H6,"This may be the most literal film adaptation of a print property we'll ever see, but that alone can't make it half as successful as it could have been. Having grown up with the trade paperback by my bedside, a holy grail of sorts for comic book fanatics, it's almost a religious experience to see these themes, characters and visuals represented so loyally on the big screen. As he did with 300, Zac Snyder has absolutely nailed the look and feel of the comics, breathtakingly, but underneath that dazzling surface is a terrible lack of soul, conviction and character. With the exception of Jackie Earl Haley, who is absolutely magnificent as the mentally teetering vigilante Rorschach, this is a large collection of miscast characters which never really seem to buy into what they're saying or doing. The words are right, ripped line-for-line from the bubbles and narrative boxes of the comics, and of course everyone looks great, but bland inflections, bad interpretations and a hectic, compressed timeframe strip away the power of the plot's weightiest moments. In a way it's TOO loyal, as it's surprisingly the one major moment that steps away from the guiding hands of the source material - a significant tweak to the story's conclusion - that works the best. Snyder was ambitious to tackle such a booby-trapped property, and to do so with such a passionate love for its roots is admirable, but there's a reason it was dubbed unfilmable for so many years. There's so much going on at any given moment that even the most familiar reader runs the risk of being bucked, and even at three hours, a large portion of the story is left on the cutting room floor. And for Watchmen, those seemingly-dispensible character moments are every bit as important as the heaviest plot developments. A valiant effort, but ultimately a failed one.",1332892800,4,1833,4.878205128205129
3574588,4,B001FB55H6,"it's a decent movie, though not as good as hype lead me to believe but still better than most.

though the main reason for the 1-star deduction is in the packaging
first off in case anyone is wondering why there are two seemingly identical 2-disc editions it is because the cheaper of the two (by about four dollars) is the Canadian version. now it appears the only real difference is that this version has some french on the packaging and has the french voice dub as an added feature (the english is still default and available for everything). I actually didn't look closely when I ordered it but it indeed shows it in the picture so I'm not going to deduct any stars for that (and since it is in region 1 there are no issues there either so if you want one of the 2-disc editions this would probably be the better choice) another thing was that the slipcover the dvd comes in has one of those ""holographic films on it so that it makes the picture look sort of 3D in expense of it making the image incredibly blurry. it's kind of cool and since the inside cover is normal I have no complaints there either. what I do have a complaint with is the slip of paper inside the case that has the code on how to unlock the digital copy. the problem is that the code is expired, now I've had a few dvds with digital copies on them but it seems like only warner bros. actually makes the codes expire! it's not an orange for crying out loud! data doesn't go bad so why do they have it expired? heck the digital copy on Star Trek (a different company) had expired a year earlier but it still worked! I don't understand the point of making it expire! if it's advertised on the cover as a feature of the product it shouldn't just become defunct on a whim!

still for the price the movie itself is good, if you don't mind a little bit of french on your cover you can get it for a steal at $6.48",1332806400,3,1881,4.193370165745856
3574639,5,B001FB55H6,"I'm not shooting for a comprehensive review.  Other front page reviews have covered most of those issues.  I just wanted to throw in my $.02.

If you get the chance, buy this cut.  The movie is more solid than any other version out there.  I think that the addition of all the cut material and the interwoven Tales of the Black Freighter, this is the closest thing to the comic that you should ever expect.  I am a huge fan of the original source material, and (while I saw the theatrical version when it opened and I loved it) I could not be happier with my experience.

I take that back.  I could be slightly happier.  Tales of the Black Freighter was interwoven into the film, and is the only thing that they didn't throw into this comprehensive edition.  I wish that I had the option to watch it as a stand-alone feature.  As far as I can tell this isn't an option.

I purchased this on pre-order.  While I'm pleased that my copy seems to be worth so much now I have no intention of selling.  I love it so much that I hope it is rereleased so that everyone can enjoy it.",1332633600,2,1074,4.200980392156863

The box and artwork in the packaging is also impressive, making for a wonderful box set that I personally now consider the only way to really watch this film.

3574641,4,B001FB55H6,"I ordered this film a bit ago, and I must say that it was definitely worth it! Here's some categories for what the actual case consists of:

CASE- The bloody smiley button with a Jolly Roger on it in place of the smiley face for the front cover (the Jolly Roger is for Tales of the Black Freighter, which is seen in Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut) and a picture of the case completely opened on the back cover with all the features neatly listed. On the inside of the case, three discs and two flaps open up to reveal the main part of the case, and a second case can be pulled out to reveal Watchmen: The Complete Motion Comics.

DISC ONE- Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut version of the original film (Director's Cut scenes and Tales of the Black Freighter) and Audio Commentary with Zack Snyder (director) and Dave Gibbons (graphic novel artist) during the film.

DISC TWO- The Phenomenon: The Comic that Changed Comics; Real Super Heroes, Real Vigilantes; Mechanics: Technologies of a Fantastic World; Watchmen: Video Journals; Music Video for ""Desolation Row"" by My Chemical Romance; Under The Hood; and Story Within A Story: The Books of Watchmen.

DISC THREE- Digital copy of theatrical version of Watchmen.

WATCHMEN: THE COMPLETE MOTION COMICS- A separate case in the larger case containing Watchmen: The Complete Motion Comics, Parts 1 and 2 (interactive reading of the graphic novel for Watchmen). Contains two discs, each with a part of the graphic novel.

The only negative thing I can say about this product is that the Ultimate Cut version of Watchmen is EXTREMELY LONG!!! In fact, the only two movies I've ever seen that even come close to it in length are King Kong (2005) at just over 3 hours and Avatar: Extended Collector's Edition at about 2 hours and 45 minutes! Even though this is an absolutely fantastic film, it's probably not a good idea to start it at 11:00 at night unless you plan on being up until 3:00 in the morning, because this is a 3 1/2 hour-long flick.

That and the fact that the only version of the film in the case is the Ultimate Cut, meaning you're going to have to watch all 325 minutes of the film unless you want to skip through it.

Other than those two minor details, this is THE version of the film Watchmen to get. It's fairly cheap, has the true version of the film, lots of extras and goodies inside, and a pretty kickass case!

3574643,5,B001FB55H6,"When one is very young, the world is a vibrant, thrilling place filled with excitement and wonder. So too are the fictional worlds one reads about in books or watches in movies. But as we grow older and more jaded, the color and wonder begin to fade. Things begin to look the same, and the world becomes a little more gray and a little less exciting. That view carries over into our entertainments, which have to try harder and harder--to be bigger, louder, and more extreme--to even get our attention. We develop a ""been there, done that,"" mentality, which is why we look back at the things we discovered in our youth with such affectionate nostalgia. It's why the thirty-something Star Wars fans panned the prequel trilogy and still hold the original trilogy as the Holy Grail. They still watch the originals with the eyes of their childhood. If they somehow had their memories erased and watched the older films ""for the first time"" with adult eyes, they would, while perhaps still enjoying them, find them somewhat juvenile and shallow, and certainly not the masterpieces they remember.

All of this is to simply say that I, as an adult, find it difficult to get truly excited about things. I enjoy reading and I enjoy cinema, but the pleasure I usually get from these endeavors is mild and fleeting. I rarely experience the obsessive anticipation for a film that I did while waiting for The Empire Strikes Back when I was ten years old, or even the 1989 Batman film when I was nineteen. I won't generally keep thinking about a movie or book for long after it's over, pining to go back and see or read it again so I can relive the experience. I think the last time I had such an experience was when The Lord of the Rings films came out. I had anticipated their release for years, because the books had been among my favorites since I was twelve. I was like a child again, full of wonder and enthusiasm. I love Batman and anticipated The Dark Knight greatly (and was not disappointed), but it wasn't the same.

Now a film has come around that I have waited years to see. I feel like a little kid again (although I do NOT recommend it for actual kids!) when I watch it or even when I think about it. It sticks with me and I can't get it out of my head or my heart. That film is Watchmen.

Now, I will admit I do not come to the film fresh. Like those Star Wars fans I mentioned before, my views are necessarily colored by the memories of my youth. I discovered Watchmen when it first appeared as a monthly, twelve issue comic book series released in 1986-1987. I had never read anything like it. It took the concept of superheroes and turned it on its ear. It addressed complex world issues, such as the then-current cold war and the threat of nuclear annihilation. It philosophically discussed the nature of mankind. And the ending presented a moral dilemma that made you second-guess who was the hero and who was the villain. Could a completely horrible act be condoned if it brought about a greatly desired result? Does the end justify the means? If you read the ending of Watchmen and didn't come away questioning everything you believed about right and wrong, you missed the whole point.

Watchmen, by writer Alan Moore and artist David Gibbons, is a comic book (or, as the pretentious would call it, a graphic novel). It is also serious literature. It was the first comic book to win a prestigious Hugo Award, and it has been named one of Time Magazine's top 100 novels from 1923 to the present. It certainly has its detractors--those who refuse to acknowledge that the comic book form can rise above its humble roots, those who expect and want a straight-forward, action packed superhero story, and those who simply don't get it--but for the most part it is acclaimed as a masterwork.

Now, as I said, I can't completely separate myself from my knowledge of the comic book while watching the film. I can't discuss it from the point of view of the uninitiated. I hope the movie plays well for people who have never heard of Watchmen before, but I can't know for sure. All I know is that to me, it was absolutely amazing. I have already seen it twice, and I know in the weeks to come I will see it several more times.

Like the book, the film takes place in 1985 in the midst of cold war paranoia. But it is a very different 1985 then the one we remember, mostly because of the existence of ""costumed adventurers,"" or superheroes. These heroes, with one exception, have no superhuman abilities; they are simply men and women who have trained their bodies to physical perfection in pursuit of their chosen vocation. They are very flawed individuals, and some take to the streets in their outrageous costumes and masks for reasons less noble than fighting crime: thrills, sexual gratification, psychopathic compulsions, or the desire to scribe their own twisted morality on the world. However, despite these flaws, or perhaps because of them, deep in their hearts they truly do want to make the world a better place.

As I said, the existence of these costumed heroes has significantly changed the world from the one we live in. The greatest bringer of change is Dr. Manhattan, the only one with actual super powers. Due to a strange accident in a science lab, physicist Dr. Jon Osterman was transformed into an almost all-powerful entity, capable of manipulating matter, teleporting, and unleashing destructive energy. He seems to have no limitations and is virtually indestructible. Due to his intervention, America won the Vietnam War. This victory allowed President Nixon to repeal the Twenty-second Amendment so he could run for more than two terms. By1985, Nixon is in his fifth term as president. A law passed in 1977 has outlawed superheroes, except those sponsored by and working for the federal government. Dr. Manhattan and an amoral, violent anti-hero called the Comedian are the only two who choose to work for the U.S.

While the Comedian performs covert military operations for the government, Dr. Manhattan is the crux of America's military superiority. The threat of his power is what keeps the USSR from attacking the United States. However, experts believe that the Soviet Union will not be cowed forever, and that they will inevitably launch a nuclear assault. Dr. Manhattan might be able to stop ninety-nine percent of Russia's missiles, but the one percent that gets through will certainly be enough to destroy the country. Nixon's finger is on the button of America's own nuclear arsenal, contemplating a pre-emptive strike.

It is difficult to remember nowadays (and impossible for young people who weren't there) the mortal terror many of us felt at the near-certainty (in our minds) of nuclear war--of mutually assured destruction. But to truly ""get"" Watchmen, you have to put yourself in that frame of mind. Today our fears revolve around terrorism. Back then, we truly feared the end of the world. Perhaps we still do, but the reasons are very different.

Amidst these times of global tension and paranoia, the Comedian is murdered. Rorschach, a hero who refused to retire in 1977 and now operates illegally, investigates. Rorschach is an obsessive man with a code of moral absolutism, in which good and evil are strictly defined. Everything is black and white; there is never any gray. He also may very well be a sociopath. As Rorschach investigates the murder, he develops the theory that there may be a ""mask killer,"" someone who is out to eliminate costumed heroes. He proceeds to warn the remaining heroes that someone is out to kill them.

On the most superficial level, Watchmen is a murder mystery. The larger plot becomes evident as Rorschach continues his investigation. There are many digressions and flashbacks, fleshing out the world and the lives of these strange heroes. Some movie goers may be put off by these digressions, thinking they are unnecessary or that they make the movie ""slow."" Certainly, this film advances at its own, leisurely pace, but these digressions are character studies which delve into the nature of humanity, which is one of the major themes of Watchmen. Why is Rorschach the man he is? You have to learn his tragic history to know. How did Dr. Manhattan get his powers, and why is he becoming detached from humanity? A lengthy flashback will tell you.

The remaining Watchmen are soon drawn into Rorschach's investigation. Nite Owl, or Dan Dreiburg, is the closest thing we get to a traditional superhero. He is mostly motivated by fighting crime and doing good, but there is an element of thrill-seeking (and a kinky fascination with playing dress-up) that motivates him as well. He uses advanced technology in his battle against wrong-doers, the most spectacular toy in his arsenal being his flying owl-ship. Silk Specter, or Laurie Jupiter (Juspeczyk in the comic), is a sexy, skilled fighter. She was pressured into becoming a costumed hero by her mother Sally, who was also known as the Silk Specter in her youth. Laurie, who is in a relationship with Dr. Manhattan, has some serious mommy issues to work through. Finally, there is Adrian Veidt, or Ozymandias, who has physically perfected both his body and mind. He is known as the world's smartest man, and, working with Dr. Manhattan, is nearing a solution to the world's energy problems. He is creating a free, renewable source of energy based on Manhattan's powers, which is sure to enrage the pioneers of industry whose bread and butter is the sale of fossil fuels and nuclear power.

In the comic, we get to know each of these characters very well. Each of them gets a full issue to examine their... um... issues... as well as their back-stories. In the movie we see far less of this, but we still get significant glimpses of the histories of the Comedian, Dr. Manhattan, and Rorschach. Sadly, Veidt, a pivotal character in both book and film, does not get much screen time.

Critics have been split over the success of this film. The website Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 65% on the ""Tomatoemeter,"" which means 65% of the reviews they have tallied are generally positive. A score of 60% or higher qualifies a film as ""fresh,"" while scores lower than this give a film a ""rotten"" designation.

Many critics have complained that some of the acting is far below par. Almost universally panned is Malin Akerman as Laurie. For the life of me, I cannot understand why. The character is not written the same in the script as she is in the comic, but Akerman does a fine job with the material she is given. In one scene in particular, where she experiences a devastating revelation about her past, she emotes powerfully the grief and despair I would expect the character to feel. I agree with most critics, though, that standout performances include Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach and Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the Comedian. These are, in my opinion, the most meaty roles, and the actors do them justice.

Since it is a murder mystery, a cold war tale, a philosophical exploration, and a character study, there is not much action in the comic. The film is short on action as well, although what's there is very intense, very violent, and very exciting. If you are only interested in action, you might want to skip this movie. You might also want to skip it if graphic violence disturbs you. Some of the fighting is brutal. Blood flies and bones break. There is one very disturbing scene of an attempted, but interrupted, rape. It is ugly and brutal, but necessary to the plot.

Much ado has been made about Dr. Manhattan's nudity in the film, but if you are at all mature and can handle the sight of a penis, it is much ado about nothing. Manhattan, having no physical need for clothing and a receding connection to humanity and its mores, does not see the need to cover himself. It is essential to his character and representative of his estrangement from the human condition. The attention many critics and movie goers have given to his nudity is both sophomoric and unwarranted. There is so much wonder to look at on the screen at any given time as to make the appearance of a blue, CGI penis negligible. All I can say is, ""grow up.""

Some are disturbed by the fact that there's also some near-pornographic sex in the film. Now, I think it could have been done more tastefully, but the sex is important to the story, especially as it deals with some of Dan Dreiburg's hang-ups. Frankly, this is a movie for adults with adult themes and ideas, so the intended audience should not be bothered by a little romp in the sack (or on an owl-ship). Plus, I wouldn't give up the opportunity to see Malin Akerman's tits for nothin'.

A major criticism of the film has been that the viewer develops little emotional attachment to the characters. Maybe it's my recollection of my affection for these characters in the novel, but I truly feel for each and every one of them while watching the movie. The Comedian is an amoral murderer, but he is also a sad, lonely man who uncovers a horrible plot and is killed for it. Rorschach is a psychopath, but his terrible past inspires pity and understanding. Laurie is tormented both by her mother's control over her destiny and her inability to face the truth about her past. Dr. Manhattan is both more and less than human, and far sadder about that fact than he lets on. Dan is lonely and purposeless, unable to feel alive unless he is wearing a costume. And Adrian Veidt, as the world's smartest (and probably richest) man must make decisions that torment him and perhaps drive him over the edge of sanity.

The ending of the movie diverges from the book in a significant way. However, the core theme remains. I said earlier that, at the end, the characters face a nearly unthinkable moral dilemma. The ""villain"" of the film has, by his actions, however heinous and insane, done a greatly desirable thing that will benefit humanity. Should his crimes be exposed, allowing evil to be punished, when to do so would reverse the good that his evil actions have accomplished? By Rorschach's code of black and white, absolutely. But the others--and the viewers--may have a different opinion. Or maybe not. The beauty of Alan Moore's story is that it doesn't decide for us. We decide. If we can.

Since the end plays out differently in the movie, a wonderful, life-affirming scene from the book is removed. It is a beautiful moment that moves me to tears every time I read it. Without it, the ending of the film comes off as much darker. Still, the movie's ending works and is powerful in its own right. I just wish one of my favorite scenes from the book made it to the screen intact. This is the only real complaint I have with the movie, and it is a very small one.

Visually, the film is dark but beautiful. Director Zack Snyder and his crew of mad geniuses have painted a stylized, gutter-chic tapestry of an alternate New York, and the special effects are out of this world (sometimes literally, as part of the movie takes place on Mars). The costumes are top-notch, as are the sets, both real and CGI. Dr. Manhattan is a triumph of animation. Even if you don't like the film's story or characters, you may still appreciate it as a visual masterpiece.

The final point I want to make is that this is not a traditional superhero movie, and it is absolutely NOT for kids. It is violent and sometimes disturbing, and it contains nudity and explicit sex. It's rated R for a reason, folks. I would say if your kids are at least 14 or 15 and pretty mature, take them to see it. Younger or immature kids... leave them at home! They will be disturbed by some parts and bored to tears by others, and they certainly won't understand it.

The opinions of naysayers notwithstanding, this is a deep, emotional work and a faithful adaptation of the comic book. Much of the richness of the comic is missing, but such loss is unavoidable when condensing a lengthy work to a two-and-a-half hour film. Watching it, I relived the joy and excitement I was able to feel more often when I was young. Seeing one of my favorite stories play out on screen was an amazing experience, and Snyder has my eternal thanks for having the guts to make this film and do it right.",1331596800,7,16203,4.673211781206171
3574644,2,B001FB55H6,"I was unfamiliar with ""The Watchmen"" graphic novel, and had wanted to see the movie when it was in theaters.  I saw this on my home theater via Amazon's streaming video.

First, the good: The story line has some interesting components - an homage to comic book characters of the past, some interesting twists in the relationships of the characters, and the compelling ""back story"" of some of the super heroes - especially Rorschach.  I can see how it would work well as a graphic novel.

There were very good performances by Jeffrey Dean Morgan as ""The Comedian"", Stephen McHattie as Hollis Mason, Carla Gugino as ""Silk Spectre"", and especially Jackie Earle Haley as ""Rorschach"".

The art direction of the movie is very good.  The visuals of the dark world of the super heroes are excellent, and the vision of Mars was beautiful.

The main problem is, in the end, these are comic book heroes.  There's just not enough story to support a three hour run time.  At some point, even the best fight sequences become tiresome if it's the sixth or seventh time a fight breaks out on screen.

A second problem is the uneven quality of the acting.  After that, the acting is sometimes there, sometimes not, and when it's not, you start looking at your watch, wishing the scene would end already.

For me, the biggest problem is the run time.  If the movie was around 100 minutes, I probably would have rated it very highly; at two hours, pretty good, but at three hours it's not a good return on the time investment.

I recognize that a director's cut is likely to be a bit self-indulgent, but 187 minutes is a lot to ask from someone when most of it rises to little more than a darker and technically more sophisticated version of the Batman TV series from the 1960's.",1329696000,,1760,4.563694267515924

Unfortunately, I didn't get to see it through. The story could not keep my attention or interest. Knowing this thing runs 2 1/2 hours, I bailed even before all the characters made it to the screen.

I'm glad I did because, even though it was about 30 minutes longer, it had so much more detail to it.

This was the best $25 I've ever spent.

3574722,3,B001FB55H6,"Making a film of this graphics novel is like trying to condense Proust's Remembrance of Things Past into a Classics Illustrated comic book.  The graphic novel is so well constructed, so packed with story, so multi-layered, and so well put together, that it would really take about a 7 hour movie to do justice to it.  In order to fit the Director's Cut into roughly 3 hours, all of the Tales of the Black Freighter subplot has been removed as well as all the inter-chapter materials from the book, which provides an incredible amount of important back story.

That obviously creates a problem, because the counter story of Tales of the Black Freighter are incredibly important elements of the whole plot.  That said, the movie is enjoyable.  The special effects in Blu-Ray are well done.  There are some great lines from the movie.  My favorite is ""You've got it all wrong.  You think I'm locked up in here with you.  But, really, you're all locked up in here with me!""  For a three hour movie, I did not find myself looking at my watch, and that is also unusual.

However, I would recommend passionate fans of the graphic novel to look for the even longer cut that brings in the Tales subplot, as it is seminal to the story.  I've not seen that, but I think it would improve the experience of the story a lot.

But the very best thing to do would be to read the graphic novel before watching any version of the movie.  This is the graphic novel rendered as very serious literature with, as the theater people like to say, exceptionally high production values.",1326153600,,1560,4.544802867383512

So if you go in expecting a ""good guys"" beating up ""bad guys"" movie, you'll most likely be disappointed.

I'm not really sure how much the Director's Cut adds to the movie. The only thing I noticed was some instances of gratuitous explicit violence, such as Rorschach's encounter with the child molester... I don't know if explicitly showing what happens adds anything to the movie.

Dark, twisted, deeply complex, undeniably the baser side of the human condition, or should I say the comic book hero condition, is Zack Snyder's, ""Watchmen."" Though the new Batman films have approached the subject matter in the duality of comic book heroes as imperfect people, living a lie as the perfect hero, no film touches this subject matter as the bottomless black vortex that is, ""Watchmen."" It's characters so disillusioned with their selves & the world, that it's hard to tell many of them apart from the bad guys their supposed to be protecting the world from. It is also a commentary of the Vietnam era, & contemplates President Nixon role as a leader if he was still in office in 1985. It does not look at individual criminals, but the human race as a whole, that is so corrupt, it is destined to implode on it's self from the weight of it's own decadence. There is violent murder, rape, lies, greed, vigilantism, hate, sex, loneliness, mass destruction, & worse of all, hypocrisy, in spades in this film. There are moments of pure transcendence, as ""Watchmen"" becomes more than just a comic book hero film, but a film that speaks of absolutes, if man kind is to survive as a species.

This film is a joy to look at, some of the most potently spectacular scenes I've ever seen in a film of this type, mostly with ""Dr. Manhattan. The scene where he is killing the Vietcong by the dozens, as a glowing, giant, god of destruction is just jaw dropping, both in the beauty & imagination of the scene, & the terror it brings with it. A true metaphor of what the Vietcong most of thought about America, charging into their country with weapons of destruction. The scenes on Mars, are truly awe inspiring, as Dr. Manhattan prefers the lifeless planet to a planet filled with humans bent on their own genocide, & the destruction of earth it's self. Other scenes too, of a smaller, but just as tragic scope. Rorschach being told by his mother she wishes he would not of been born after having sex with a john. Rorschach biting the ear off a bully, was pure unadulterated viciousness. The scene where he finds the little girl in the wood burner, & the dogs chewing, fighting, over her leg, & his vengeance not only on the dogs, but her killer is absolutely brutal. The Comedian, killing the pregnant Vietnamese woman, who was carrying his baby. He then looked at Dr. Manhattan who was shocked, & told him, he could've of stopped him anytime, but didn't. Dr. Manhattan's self startling realization that this was true. The Comedian hired by his own country to kill it's President. Yes, this is a film with a message, a deeply dark message, a true message, that super heroes mean nothing in a world that is ran by greed & corruption, by man. That only man can save mankind, & no other force, earthly or not, can change that. This is ""Watchmen.""",1322784000,,2866,4.584795321637427

It's a superhero comic with violence and sex and curse words!""

Comics don't make good movies. They are their own special medium. Hollywood preys upon a certain segment of ""fandom"" who need to have their tastes validated by popular acceptance. They crank out adaptations of comics, video games, and old ""cult"" movies to make fast money, knowing that ""fan loyalty"" transcends good judgment. That's the only reason the long gestated Watchmen movie was ever greenlit. It's all nonsense. There is no need for a Watchmen movie, especially one as bad as this.

3574859,4,B001FB55H6,"The graphic novel escaped my notice in the fast flowing stream of pop culture and I've never read it. Conventional wisdom  says that the movie's good but flawed because it's too faithful to the original material. Since I've never seen the 'original material', then, my review may offer some perspective. The movie has an appealing premise, cast, cosutmes, set design, good special effects, fast moving plot and enough gritty 'noir' atmosphere to satisfy us fans of that genre.
The premise is just believable enough to create a 'real world' for these characters. The 'heroes' are flawed humans (well, Dr. Manhattan was and still is sort of human) acting out a sci-fi mystery.  There are quite a few 'adult' moments, with nudity, simulated sex and bad language but these fit so integrally into the story that it isn't offensive.
The 'Black Freighter' story within a story is probably appealing to the fans of the 'graphic novel' (aka comic book) but for my money are unnecessary. I'm sure there's some allegory or meaning connected to the larger story but I prefer to enjoy the film on its own as a good 'noir' yarn about outlaw, past-their-prime costumed vigilantes in a global power struggle with evil, large and small.
Despite the opinions of other reviewers, I think the story moves along coherently. You can easily tell when the time frame shifts forward and back.
It may not have 'big name' stars but the actors here are very appealing and fill up the screen as well as any big dollar talent would in these roles. The Comedian is a scene stealer and Rorschach is as good as you'd hope. Dr. Manhattan and Nite Owl both become fully engaging characters by the end of the film.

WATCHMEN would have to be one of the definitive graphic novels to film. Along with BATMAN BEGINS, THE DARK KNIGHT, SIN CITY, X-MEN 2 X-MEN UNITED and the impressively underrated X-MEN FIRST CLASS would have to be the elite example on how to translate the graphic novel to film. WATCHMEN has a subversive subtext in how Western society is in need of natural resources with the twin towers constantly in the background throughout the film. The interpretation one can come up with is the need for endless natural resource that Ozymandis constantly refers to would wipe out wars. One could see that to mean that the United States had manipulated the collapse of the twin towers to invade for oil in Middle Eastern countries. The way Ozymandis triggers a nuclear detonation in New York is practiculary saying the United States conspired in the collapse of the twin towers. Those messages are there if one chooses to look hard enough below the stunning imagery of this film. Dr Manhattan would have to be the most tragic superhero commited to film. The director's cut is a more satisfying version as scenes are extended and new scenes added to the film. This is a hard nihilistic film that plays it strong when it comes to uncompromising violence that gives it credibility and appeal to people on the fringe of a desperate society.",1314748800,3,1447,4.862348178137652
3574938,1,B001FB55H6,"Prologue: I have no familiarity with the graphic novel ""Watchmen"" so I know nothing about the intricacies and nuances of from where this movie emenated from.

This movie stinks! It's so boring, so long, so geeky (this would make ""Harry Potter"", ""Lord of the Rings"" and any other fandom flick look sooooo cool).

This is about a alternative world where Richard Nixon, instead of being the resigned falure, was a fixture in the 80's. Superheros were first a fixture in society and now they have been outcast. Somebody is killing the old , retired superheros.

As person that knows nothing about the background of this, here are my feelings;

1) The actors/actresses have no charisma in the least bit. They do not exude ""superhero"" in any way;

2) The big,bald muscular blue superhero dude is a really, unbelievable (even in a fantasy realm) and silly character. The movie focuses on him and this is an utterly ridiculous character;

3) All the other superheros are portrayed with such little development that if anything happens to them, you will care less;

4) The story is cliched and too well worn;

5) Villains can't be wusses!

Sometimes there exists great stories, that are in the sci fi/fantasy  genre, but they cannot be transformed into cinema without taking on a goofy, cartoonish persona (ie. Daredevil, Fantastic Four, Hulk...anything that is too fantasy).  That fits this overlong nerdfest to a tee.

This movie is ambitious and it does have it's moments but, unless you are previously enthralled with what is going on, this is the most pretentious and geeky movie ever. There's not a lot of  redeeming value to this movie that takes itself way too seriously. I'm sorry, but for the lengthy time investment, this movie really stinks. It's not even a guilty pleaure.

By the way, I wanted to like this movie because I [sometimes] respect a geeky movie. It seems as though this movie only coveted the previous fans of the graphic novel without considering the casual moviegoer.",1314057600,,1986,4.872023809523809

3574942,4,B001FB55H6,"Well acted and possibly the best comic adaptation of recent years. At times however it feels like Snyder overused action sequences and gore too much. The overall message from the graphic novel was there, middle aged vigilantism, and at times kept the same brooding nature. Some scenes were altered for continuity and to make the story line look like it happened in a a matter of days. Changing the ending, though it may appear as heresy to the fans of the graphic novel, made the Watchmen acessable to a new audience while allowing for the Film to be shorter, The music adds to the moment and some of the montages are fantastic. The Film ignored many of the sub-plots and tiny relationships built up in Moore's work however if you look the relationships are there; they are just not as explicitly pointed out. All in all a very good translation only stopped from being truly fantastic by the insistence of fight sequences and gore that adds nothing to the plot and seem to be there just so those who wish to see violence do not get bored",1312329600,2,1037,4.550802139037433

I felt like he brought the novel as alive as he could and it is just a beautiful movie.  The guy has incredible vision.  His movie 300 was a beautiful film and this just shows his technical abilities are getting better and better.  Even though Sucker Punch was a piece of crap, it looked amazing

That said, I must admit that I am a sucker for comic book/graphic novel movies.  Although The Green Lantern was panned by critics and had some weaknesses, I still loved it.

3574945,5,B001FB55H6,"Somewhere in New York City in an alternate 1985, superheroes have been outlawed and Richard Nixon is still president. A former super soldier named Comedian (Jeffery Dean Morgan) was brutally murdered one night, Comedian's pals from a team called CrimeBusters with heroes like Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) who is a Superman-esque immortal god of powers, blank masked avenger Roschach (Jackie Earl Haley), sexy buttkicker Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman) and intelligent Batman-esque Nightowl (Patrick Wilson) are together trying to untangle the mystery of who killed Comedian. They are also trying to find out who is behind an uncanny government conspiracy that could cause World War III for they must find the culprit who is behind this.

A brilliant and faithful adaptation of the beloved DC Comics graphic novel from Alan Moore and David Gibbons. After many years since 1987 in development hell through many studios like FOX, Universal, Warner, New Line, Paramount to even MGM trying to make the unfilmable graphic novel into a motion picture as many directors from Terry Gilliam to Darren Arfofsky tried, then after the success of the motion picture adaptation of Frank Miller's 300 Zack Snyder was chosen as director since he's a comic fan. He used the graphic novel as storyboards for the film as the film was a shot-to-shot frame-by-frame nearly adaptation that captures Alan Moore's masterpiece well on the big screen. It also uses the comic's brilliant satire on superheros and political issues that brings the audience to an alternate universe not seen since The Matrix. It's a thrilling, complex, intelligent and ultraviolent film that sure isn't like any superhero film you seen and it's definitely not for children, this is a comic movie for adults. This is R-rated stuff here like the graphic novel with language, a couple of sex scenes with some nudity, gory violence and of course complexity, Greg Cannom's make-up effects are terrific including the motion capture technology for Dr. Manhattan. Co-starring Matt Frewer, this is a must see motion picture for anyone who likes Sci-fi, action, complex thrillers or comic book movies but remember to read the graphic novel first.

This version is the best of three cuts since it's the longest and interludes the animated ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" pirate comic story into the film at times for a more unique experience including 2 commentaries and the extras include the amusing short film ""Under teh Hood"" which shows the origins of the original Nite Owel, 4 documentaries, music video, 11 video journals and a bonus disc which is the graphic novel motion comic.",1310774400,2,2624,5.142857142857143
3574946,4,B001FB55H6,"This is a review of the Nite Owl version since people have talked about the blu-ray at length elsewhere.

The model is quite nicely done, with decent detail, airbrushed paint, lights & sound.  Collectors should be pleased.  The ship detaches from the base.  You activate the lights & sound via a ""hidden"" button on the top of the ship.  It has white lights on the front, lights on the bottom light up the base and rear blue lights for the engines.  The sound effects are thunder, crashing waves and the whine of the engines as the ship takes off.  The lights stay on until you press the button again.  It would be a shame to leave the ship boxed up.

I got this on sale and was quite pleased with it even though I'm not a huge fan of the movie.  Well, the blu-ray is nicely done too, and worth watching a few times.

I'd give it five stars if the movie was better and the regular price of this version wasn't so expensive.  Amazon deserves credit for offering such a nice collector's edition though.",1310428800,,999,4.34054054054054

3575030,3,B001FB55H6,"The filmmakers behind Watchmen faced the difficulty encountered by all brave souls who endeavor to adapt a much-loved work of literature to the screen: how to rearrange the narrative to a filmic structure of approximately two hours.  Those who practice the relatively new task of adapting graphic novels face an additional challenge: how to interpret visually what has already been interpreted.  Though a literary work will often have precise visual descriptions of the narrative's world, there are scores of equally valid possible interpretations of Tolkien's Middle Earth or Dickens's London.  The challenge faced by adaptors of graphic novels is that the narrative is already laid out for them frame by frame.  When the graphic novel is not widely read before the release of the film (such as in the cases of Ghost World or Road to Perdition), this poses less of a problem to the filmmaker.  But with a work as widely read and beloved as Watchmen, it is as if a filmmaker's storyboards were devoured and studied by the public years before the release of the film.  Though it would still be a treat to those who have viewed the storyboards to see the film, much of the visual impact would be stripped away.  Such is Watchmen's cross to bear.

Watchmen has long been thought of as an ""unfilmable"" work, in the same category as scores of novels with long, interweaving plotlines, shifting narratives, and challenging themes.  Zack Snyder used the clout he gained from directing 300 to tackle the challenge, and he has turned in an admirable effort.  Those who have loved Alan Moore's creation for two decades (check time) understandably expected the worst: a soulless superhero film devoid of the numerous mature themes of the original (see the adaptation of Alan Moore's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) Snyder exhibits a strong appreciation of these themes, and valiantly attempts to pack in as many as possible in the film's bloated 162 minute running time.

It is this very dedication to the original that gets Snyder into trouble.  While staying faithful to a masterpiece is rarely a bad strategy for adaptation, Snyder fails to offer much in his screen adaptation that was not present in the original graphic novel.  While he has made changes to the narrative, some significant, had a director offered a perfectly faithful interpretation, the emotional and intellectual impact of the film would be much the same.

What is particularly discouraging is that early in the film, Snyder shows a moment of extreme engagement with the original work while using the medium of film to differentiate his work from the original.  After the opening scene, the opening credits offer a beautifully shot and edited alternate history of a world with the film's characters, set to Bob Dylan singing ""Times They Are A'Changin'.""  While the original work slowly allows the reader into the alternate universe, allowing the discovery of the differences in the story's world to unfold throughout the graphic novel, Snyder yanks the viewer into the world in the length of time it took Bob Dylan to redefine popular music.  This suits the filmic medium well, and offers the film a promising start, but for the rest of the film's runtime, Snyder is unable to match either the kinetic energy or the original interpretation of the credit sequence.

Alan Moore has never been happy with a film adaptation of any of his works, and I suspect he is the least unhappy with Watchmen, as Snyder shows a reverence for and understanding of the original missing in other interpretations of his work.  But while he may have kept Mr. Moore and die-hard fans of the original mollified, he did a disservice to the work by offering audiences little that could not be gained by a re-read of the graphic novel.  It is difficult in adaptation to be faithful to an original without being reverent, to honor it without it becoming an albatross.  While the initial thrill of seeing the beautifully rendered Dr. Manhattan, the flowing mask of Rorschach, and Watchmen's countless other iconic visuals is great, Snyder's decision to use the original as little more than a storyboard does a disservice to the revolutionary spirit of the original, and makes the adaptation of Watchmen something that the original never could be: boring.",1309305600,2,4295,4.979020979020979
3575031,5,B001FB55H6,"This movie is a great, brilliant and nearly perfect adaptation of the graphic novel.  The adaptation of the characters and the scenes from the graphic novel are also nearly perfect and the effects are pretty sick as well.

My only complaint about this movie is that it is nearly an exact copy of the graphic novel.  I think that the movie would have benefited from some outside the box thinking, perhaps a scene change or too, and perhaps not such a complete and rigid devotion to the graphic novel.

In my opinion, this is one of my favorite comic book adaptations as it is based off my favorite graphic novel, and is one of my favorite movies as well.  I do think that the movie can be slightly slow every and then and would have benefited from and additional fight or action scene or two.

I definately recommend this movie, as it is exciting, fast paced and is great.  The ending is even more awesome!  I also recommend that you get and read the graphic novel as it is one of the best comic's you will ever find.  In addition to being a great action flick, the movie is rife with the political overtones of the graphic novel and also retains its Utilitarian philisophical approach to forcing world peace.

Definately pick this movie up, you won't be disappointed!
Btw- Rorschach is the man!",1309219200,,1294,4.515021459227468
3575032,5,B001FB55H6,"The naysayers will always mention the same things: the story is too complex, the theater isn't the right medium, film can't capture the awe of the story - all of these things have led to the Watchmen being labeled as the unfilmable movie, and none of this was helped by Watchmen author Alan Moore stating these very same feelings about it.

The truth is that everybody wanted a Watchmen movie, but everyone was scared that it would turn out horrible. We've seen it happen to past graphic novels made for the big screen, and we've seen it happen with Alan Moore's own work. Sure movies from his past writings have been entertaining, but they also clearly missed their mark when trying to bring the majesty of Moore's stories to the big screen. In fact, many didn't even try.

Talking about a Watchmen movie was like playing Russian roulette. It would make for an epic film, but it could also be a complete disaster. With Batman Begins showing that realism in superhero films could be accomplished, it all but sealed the fate of a Watchmen big screen debut. People were worried, but when Zac Snyder stepped up and proclaimed that if anyone was going to screw up a Watchmen movie it might as well be him - a fan - you knew, at the very least, that it wasn't going to fall completely flat. Snyder might not make the best adaption, but it also won't turn out like a Roger Corman flick.

Zac Snyder knew that he wasn't going to make everyone happy, but in his film version of the Watchmen, if you don't come away with a sense of awe and appreciation, you're nothing more than a comic snob - nothing would have made you happy to begin with.

Snyder did his best to make one great film about the main plot of the Watchmen, while diving into the psychology of superheroes and the tensions of the cold war. The realism was incredible, despite the often Matrix-style fight scenes. From Night Owl's self-doubt to Rorschach's steely conservativism and lunacy to Ozymandias' righteousness and god-complex to Dr. Manhattan's struggles with re-asserting his humanity, these superheroes represent a very real deconstruction of their archetypes. Even Silk Spectre's familial issues and the Comedian's parody of humanity's obsession with violence will connect with even the most detached - and superhero unfriendly - viewers.

Despite some missing elements, missing sub-plots and minimal changes (and one major change with the ending), Snyder succeeds in capturing the essence of what made the Watchmen comic book great. In fact, Snyder is such a true fan of the comic book, that many of the visual pieces of the movie could have their frames frozen and you'd be able to match the scene with an almost identical panel from the graphic novel.

The acting was anchored quite well by Jeffrey Dean Morgan - in the role of the Comedian - and surprisingly enough, Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. I was skeptical of Haley upon first seeing him. His bald head and angular face didn't seem to fit well with Rorschach's under-the-mask appearance. But with the addition of red hair and freckles, Haley pulled it off visually - not to mention pouring his soul into this once-in-a-lifetime role. He truly brought Rorschach to life. Billy Crudup, meanwhile, probably had the hardest job - creating sympathy for a character who has lost his humanity. Crudup, despite the special effects managed to show just the slight amount of emotion necessary to make his character believeable.

To add to the experience, the music for the movie was an excellence choice of songs that completely reflected the times portrayed in the film, adding a much deeper sense of realism and continuity not often felt in superhero movies.

There were a lot of people in that theater with me, and I know many of them never read the graphic novel version of the Watchmen before. I'm hoping that seeing this movie encourages them to do so in order to appreciate Alan Moore's spectacular story on its many different levels.",1309132800,,3962,4.790629575402636

I don't know if that was because I had no other reference point to go by, having never heard of Watchmen or the novel it's taken from.  This left me with no other option than what was presented.  They say presentation is everything, and in this case, Watchmen can't be faulted on style.  On everything else though, serious sensory overload: the music was too loud and intrusive, the undeveloped plot difficult to follow, the `mood' lighting completely left me in the dark (figuratively and literally).  The opening fight sequence was almost completely lost on me, seeing that it was purposely obscured, as was much of this film.  There were far too many flashbacks, hinting at what, most felt incomplete.  There were also far too many characters to juggle, most of them thoroughly unlikable and dealt with in a limited fashion.  It was difficult to pinpoint the villain of the piece as so many were villainous at one time or another.  When the `true' villain was eventually revealed he proved to be so bland and banal it made everything that had come before the great revelation completely laughable.  As the story meandered for 186 minutes I kept thinking, what's the point?  Even when it finally ended, I kept thinking, what's the point?
I found this movie smug, pretentious, humorless, and not a little snide.  Being dated was the least of its worries.  Alternate universe or not, it still had to battle for a modicum of relevancy.

3575181,4,B001FB55H6,"The Film: ***** 5 Stars. What can be said that hasn't already. Despite several director's (in this case Zach Snyder) hubris in wanting to turn comics/literature into films, Zach Snyder succeeds in this outing. Complete, finally, with the Black Freighter added back in (and serves the overall story of both, much better). Despite changing some details with the finale' (not the plot but the mechanism for it)it can be said in confidence that the choice serves the story better, if not as psychologically logical or powerful. Overall, I enjoyed the film and read the Graphic Novel again immediately after and this did not deter from my liking the ""Ultimate Cut"" of the film. Faithful to the core story and visually a treat. A mature, cynical story about human nature and I loved every minute of it.

The Blu-Ray packaging/presentation: **** 4 Stars. Nice, attractive set in a sturdy fold-out box. Too many discs for a Blu-Ray however.

Marketing: ** 2 Stars. The Blu-Ray itself and the special features within are great and no complaints regarding this specifically. My criticism stems from the way the Watchmen was marketed on Home Video, in general. This supposed four disc collection, really doesn't extend beyond the two Blu-Rays (one being the film and the other, special features). The other two discs are the digital copy of the theatrical release (which, if you don't like invasive software from WB, is useless) and the Motion Comic (the actual, previously released motion comic). Now, please don't misunderstand, I knew what I was getting into and I feel others looking for this definitive version do to. It is overall frustration that it was released and marketed in three different versions. The Director's Cut and Ultimate cut, released, worded and presented in ambiguous ways to confuse us into buying both (and, no, I didn't buy both, just this one). I guess this is a criticism of the industry regarding a perceived Home Video hot commodity. With Blu-Ray technology, why do we have to suffer so many of these multi-disc versions and cuts of films? When will the industry learn? Give us WHAT we want and we will buy it. Not SOME of what we want. The various Watchmen versions out there are a testament to my argument; Theatrical and Directors Cuts (and various other DVDs/Blu-Rays) are all around $10 or less, still new from vendors, the Ultimate Cut DVD and Blu-Ray are currently available only on the Secondary Market and the Blu-Ray is going for high prices. Hmm. Well, at least the current trend is to include both a Blu-Ray and DVD copy in current Blu-Ray discs, so maybe they are learning.",1305158400,,2607,4.8826185101580135

3575186,5,B001FB55H6,"First off I enjoyed the graphic novel and the movie despite many differences.

Watchmen is not your normal comic book movie. This movie is very dark and is a satire focusing on human nature. Watchmen does not portray the classic comic book hero, in fact only one person has ""super"" powers; but rather it focuses on the more human aspects of the characters. That being said, it is not the most action packed movie of all time, but in my opinion is an exploration of human nature. The movie has a lot of characterization, each character being different in many ways; From the powerful Dr. Manhattan losing his grip on what made him human, to Rorschach the man who takes on the goal of defeating what he believes are humanities flaws. The characters are deep (not as deep as the book) and show the worst and best of humanity. All this being said, if you are looking for a fast paced story with lots of action Ironman may be a better bet. Violence and Adult themes wise, this movie is full of them. This is not a movie to show to children. The action scenes are gory, on par with Snyder's other work 300. There are scenes of sex,rape, and nudity throughout. All of this is holds true to the dark gritty atmosphere, and as fair warning if this offends you do not see this movie.

As far as the bonus content, I believe it added to the story, especially the former Night Owl. This may be as a result of reading the graphic novel however.

In general, I enjoyed the movie for its themes and how it stretches the goals and nature of humanity.",1302652800,,1534,4.375438596491228

That being said, after reading about Zack Snyder's adaptation of Frank Miller's celebrated and critically acclaimed work, when I finally DID see the theatrical release, I was absolutely BLOWN AWAY. I LOVED this film, and it has since become one of my all time favorite films. I love how different it is in comparison to the other ""comic book"" adaps. This is a completely different animal. The story was real and poignant, and the ""alternate history"" aspect, as well as inclusions of real people (Pat Buchannan, and Lee Iacocca come to mind) really made this a film to go down in history. Faithful to the material, for the very most part, Snyder's visionary and home-hitting directing style, the stellar cast (JACKIE EARLE HALEY, anybody!?) and accurate and well made production was through the roof. Now, on to the Director's Cut of the film, I personally prefer this one to the ""Ultimate Edition"" which inserts ""The Tales of the Black Freighter"" into the entire film. That animated film, as important as it is to the mythos, is better viewed by itself, again, in my opinion. With this version, I believe you get Zack Snyder's best cut of the film, one that the fans will appreciate it, and get a kick out of the added footage that reminds them of the same parts from the graphic novel.

3575277,5,B001FB55H6,"DIRECTOR'S CUT REVIEW (This review contains very minor SPOILERS. I emphasize ""MINOR"". I do not give away the ending, nor any key plot elements. Those that have read the graphic novel will hear about some differences. Those unfamiliar with it will largely be none the wiser. All that being said, if you want a 100% untainted fresh look, you might wish to avoid this review.)

Alright, let's get a few things out of the way. I'm late to the review party here, but felt it necessary to praise this film.

That being said, to those unfamiliar with the graphic novel upon which it is based, I can understand how this might be impenetrable to you. Warner Brothers didn't do the general public any favors by marketing this as a generic ""super-hero"" movie. It isn't. It's about as far as you can get from it.

Before extolling the positives of this film, I'll first deal with the misconceptions and then the genuine negatives.

Misconceptions and other silly gripes:

-  Again, Warner Brothers tried to mislead the public about what this film was about. Many walked in thinking they were seeing a Batman or Superman clone only to see the protagonists engage in genuinely unseemly behavior. If you were hoodwinked, I'm sorry. But this is meant to be a gritty and dark story. There are no pure ""heroes"" even though most of the characters have good intentions. Alan Moore wrote a story that emphasizes human fallibility over the god-like cookie-cutter pure super heroes that had been prevalent for so long. In so doing, he revolutionized the genre. No apologies are necessary. If you want an uplifting story, this is not for you.

-  No small measure of griping was directed at Dr. Manhattan's nudity. His nudity is meant to express his growing distance from humanity. As he becomes less human, he loses normal human notions of modesty and shame. I'll agree that it wasn't explained perfectly in the film. That being said, if you have that much issue with the naked male form, perhaps you should seek counseling.

-  The politics are nonsensical. Absolutely true. Contemporary commentary on Watchmen (the GN) illustrated a lot of praise for the ""political message"". If there's a coherent political message in there, I'll freely admit that I've never found it. Any political message intended to be conveyed falls apart quickly upon any real analysis. Alan Moore, for as much as I admire him as a story teller, was never, in my opinion, a brilliant political philosopher. What is left is a strong tale of ethical and moral quandaries. As far as I'm concerned, that's where the story shines.

-  The ""squid"". If you've read the story, you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't (and are still reading), skip to the next section. Yes, Snyder chose to get rid of the squid in favor of another plot device. Some fanboys cried foul. I'd argue that they're mostly wrong. The plot device selected in its place works quite well and does not change the impact of the story in any meaningful way.

Genuine gripes (and some that aren't):

- Silk Spectre in Archie: In the GN, there is a scene where young Silk Spectre, attempting to light her cigarette, pushes a button while sitting in an airship. The button depicts an image of flame. She assumes (incorrectly) that it is the button for the cigarette lighter. Instead, she activates the flamethrowers. It is a moment of comic relief in the GN. In the film, due to what I can only guess is the general demonization of smoking that is going around, the scene is changed in a minor but very important way. Silk Spectre is not looking to light a cigarette (because, presumably, that would be bad...despite the film having an R rating). Instead, she impishly pushes a button marked with flame designs on it for no apparent reason. I would have preferred that they cut the scene entirely or stick to the original story rather than transform Silk Spectre from a woman who made an honest mistake into a mischievous bimbo.

- Casting: Overall, it's not bad. Matthew Goode as Ozymandias will disappoint many. His swallowed consonants and underwhelming physique make it tough to accept him as the closest thing to a ""perfect man"" that the original story indicates that he is. Malin Akerman performs admirably, for the most part, as the young Silk Spectre, but she is still a bit too young for the role (this only compounds the script-writing sin mentioned in the previous gripe). Patrick Wilson also comes across as slightly too young for his character, the younger Nite Owl, but it's close enough. I had initial reservations about Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan, but I believe that he fills the role quite well (his relatively soft voice is initially off-putting to anyone familiar with the GN, but the distant and emotionless portrayal (that's a compliment for this role) brings it back). Jeffrey Dean Morgan is well cast as the Comedian. Jackie Earle Haley is absolutely brilliant as Rorschach.

- Rorschach scene changes: Without going into any specific details, there are a few scenes that are changed when Rorschach faces villains: prison cell scene 1 (saw rather than torch) and kidnapper scene (axe rather than fire). Honestly I don't know why the changes were made. They seem rather pointless to me, but I'll freely admit that they're more or less lateral steps rather than improvements or detractions. They seem unnecessary, but they don't harm the portrayal or the story in any significant way.

- Bubastas: Fans of the GN will recall that Ozymandias dabbles in genetic engineering. It makes sense that he has a genetically engineered blue tiger with horns (""Bubastas"") as a pet. In the original story, the genetic/bio engineering feeds into the ""squid"" story line. With the ""squid"" gone and no mention of Ozymandias' hobby of genetic engineering, we're left with an unexplained mutant tiger. It's a minor point, but an illustration of how this film can be impenetrable to those unfamiliar with the GN. Things have been changed at times with no effort to pick up the slack for the now-lost information that was conveyed by such scenes. It would have been better to cut the tiger completely or to include a throwaway line about how Ozymandias dabbles in genetic engineering. Instead, we're left with what I can only assume is well-intentioned fan service that only serves to alienate the uninitiated audience.

- Director's cut does not contain the Black Freighter footage: In the original GN, the story was paralleled quite well by another story called ""Tales of the Black Freighter"". It worked quite well in the GN, but I do think that the screen version benefits from the absence of the Black Freighter footage.

Finally, the pros: Cinematography is excellent, soundtrack is mostly spot-on to convey the mood intended, story is very strong, acting is mostly well done, and the director's cut restores some footage that expands on and clarifies the story quite well.

Bottom line: This is a story that has long been considered ""unfilmable"". I think Snyder proved everyone wrong. This is an admirable effort to portray the Watchmen story that is, while not perfect, better than most fans ever anticipated. I do need to caution that those unfamiliar with the original story may find themselves lost. I think Snyder made every effort to balance sometimes conflicting goals of: staying true to the story, adapting elements that were not really fit for the big screen, and condensing where necessary. At times, exposition to the non-initiated may have suffered as a result of the choices made.",1298505600,,7521,4.8655199374511335
3575375,5,B001FB55H6,"I've seen half of the theatrical cut, then stopped and switched to this version.  It's far better and I intend to refer to ""Watchmen"" as this version in the same way I refer to ""Lord of the Rings"" as the extended versions only.

As far as the quality of the film--I find it great.  But it's not one that I'd recommend to everyone.  Unfortunately I think it is best slated as an excellent companion piece to the graphic novel.  Sit down and read the graphic novel, and if you love it, watch the movie.  I believe the kind of person that wouldn't be into reading the novel but would still watch and love this movie aren't too many in number.  So keep that in mind.

All of that said, this is by far the best film adaptation of a book or comic book I've ever seen.  What makes it so good?
(Spoiler alert)

1) The interpretation to film.  Snyder has a great eye for visuals, and he clearly worked very hard to put many shots into the film that were directly inspired by the art in the graphic novel.  This helps you truly feel like you're watching the novel come to life, but not that you're watching a comic book.
2) The casting and acting.  All of the performances in this movie I would rate as good to stellar.  Dr. Manhattan and Laurie were ""good.""  Crudup's Manhattan was stale and stiff (no jokes, please), but then that's how he is in the novel.  So what to do?  Gugino was good as Laurie, but hers was not a show-stealing performance.  The top performances go to
  --Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl II--or really Dan Drieberg, which is where he really shines.  He has just the right awkwardness around Laurie, just the right uncertainty of himself, and you feel the displacement and forgottenness of Dan in Patrick's eyes.
  --Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian.  First of all, he really looked the part.  Everyone else looked good or okay, but Morgan came out as the spitting image of his comic book counterpart.  And as I'm watching him burn the Northern Vietnamese or shoot his pregnant mistress or beat Silk Spectre onto a pool table just before trying to raper her, I found myself hating him just like I did when I read the book.
  --Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach.  This is the performance that should have at least gotten an Oscar nod.  Haley's voice was exactly the way it should have sounded, and his portrayal of Kovacs was endlessly more sinister and unsettling than the way it came across in the novel.  Seriously--read the parts of the novel again that focus on the unmasked Rorschach, and then watch those scenes in the movie.  Which version scares you more?  When he's in the psychotherapy session, he is much more clearly messing with the analyst.  When he gets aprehended after throwing grease on that guy in prison, his line, ""None of you seem to understand . . ."" was excecuted perfectly.  And when he completely loses it while facing down Dr. Manhattan at the end, he closes off a flawless performance.
3) The changes from the story.  These always piss off the fanboys, but every change I saw in the movie either had no impact on the story (Laurie's smoking, changing ""Crimebusters"" to ""Watchmen,"" and making that Ozymandias's idea rather than Captain Metropolis's, the way Rorschach killed the little girls' murderer, cutting off that dude's arms rather than just slitting his throat, etc.), were the right move for the sake of the film (oil-powered cars still in prominence, leaving out the parallel story of The Black Freighter, having Archie land closer to Ozzy's palace so they can walk instead of ride floating Segways, shortening Rorschach's psychotherapy sessions to a single session, etc.), or were vast improvments over the original story (The ending--without a doubt.  Having the false enemy be Dr. Manhattan instead of a nameless alien race, and having cities all over the world effected rather than one neighborhood of New York made the ending much more gripping and personal.)
4) The nods and small references throughout the movie.  There were the obvious ones, such as the cameos of the newstand and the kid reading The Black Freighter, but there are also a couple shots near the beginning of Captain Metropolis and Hooded Justice obviously flirting with one another, the alien squid's cameo, and the list goes on.  It's important and good that Snyder did this because it's acknowledgements to things he had to leave out but didn't want to be ignored.  It states that he cares about the source material.

I have a few small gripes here and there, but I don't want to list them and taint a positive review.  If you watch it, find your own gripes, if you find any.

So don't pop this movie in and expect to love it if you don't like comic book movies.  It's also best viewed after reading the graphic novel, as it brings it to life masterfully.  4.5 stars.",1298246400,2,4790,4.623222748815166

But, I quickly picked the graphic novel of all 12 issues and immediately was immersed into all the characters and sub-stories.

This is truly a defining moment, in a time, where this type of storytelling has not been matched in it 's raw, intellectual, realistic and pioneering in a long time or since. I understand the nature of the popularity to this series forever, now. I watched this movie a second time and was even more enthralled with it from start to finish!

Previously WB came out with two other versions of the film.  First there was the vanilla Theatrical Cut, which was obviously the one seen in theaters that runs 2 1/2 hours and you could consider the Cliff Notes version of the story.  Then along came the ""Director's Cut"" that had some deleted scenes (notably the death of Hollis Mason, aka Nite Owl 1, which I don't consider a spoiler since if you're reading this again you're obviously a fan) and went about 3 hours.  On the side there was also ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" which is the animated adaptation of the comic-within-the-comic of the Watchmen graphic novel.  Plus there was ""Under the Hood,"" a documentary (or sort of mockumentary) about how superheroes got started in the Watchmen universe.

Now with the Ultimate Edition the ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" is inserted into the Director's Cut version of the film with some added transitions featuring the Bernards at the newsstand, and also you get Gerard Butler's name awkwardly sandwiched into the opening credits.  This beefs the movie up to 3 1/2 hours and comes as close as you're going to get to a complete treatment of the graphic novel.

I have to say I didn't really find this necessary.  It's nice to have the Black Freighter story since it serves as an allegory of the main story, but I thought it pulled me out of the main story.  Also since there's still no squid monster there isn't the connection between the Black Freighter and the rest of the story there was in the graphic novel, where the writer of the Black Freighter helped come up with the squid monster.

The other four DVDs in the set contain a digital copy of the theatrical release that will not work if you bought it after November 2010.  (Thanks, WB!)  You also get ""Under the Hood,"" some other featurettes, and the ""motion comics"" that take the actual graphic novel and move it around with voices and such added.  I would have liked an actual DVD of the theatrical version instead of the non-functioning digital copy, but you can't have everything.

As of now Amazon has run out but other sites [coughBuycoughdotcom] still have it in stock and it costs less than two tickets to the latest 3D shlockfest in the theaters.

Watchmen stars Malin Akerman as Silk Spectre II (her mom was the original), Billy Crudup plays Dr Manhattan (the only character with super powers in the film), Jackie Haley plays Rorschach (my favorite) the sole remaining vigilante who did not quit when the government ordered the ""masks"" to stop fighting crime. Jeffrey Morgan plays The Comedian (see picture) whose death begins the story. And Patrick Wilson plays Nite Owl II (think Batman).

Okay, there are many more characters but I don't feel like writing about all of them.

The plot, The Comedian is thrown out of a window and Rorshach believes someone is targeting the old crimefighters.

His mission is to warn those who he was affiliated with.

Meanwhile, Dr Manhattan, a being who can manipulate matter, is working on a way to harness his energy to create the perfect source of fuel for the world.

So is someone going after the Watchmen? And will the world end up nuking themselves to oblivion? Watch the movie.

Or don't because it's really long and really boring.

Really - really boring.

It's directed by the guy who made 300 (another film based on a graphic novel) so there's a lot of slow-motion action scenes with lots of bloody violence and too much nudity.

""Too much"" you ask? Yes - there really doesn't need to be any. We're talking about a man who glows blue and doesn't wear a single article of clothing...

3575531,4,B001FB55H6,"Bottom-Line: ""Watchmen"" is one of those movies you really have to see at least twice to get the full effect.

Ah, Comic Books, they are the province of fertile imaginations and seriously good artwork.  I didn't really cotton to the $.75 color rags growing up; I got into them after I was stationed overseas and longed for a patch of home.  My favorites were those from Marvel Comics: Xmen, Wolverine, The Mighty Thor, and Spiderman.  DC Comics were never that exciting for me, Superman aside of course.  So I was never fan of The Watchmen, though I have heard of the comic series.

But, comics made into movies, well no matter who inked the paper, it's time to watch.  Some like the original Superman (1978) were instant classics, while others like The Punisher (2004), and Punisher: War Zone (2008) were, well, instant stinkers.  ""Watchmen"" (2009), while not as fun to watch as Superman is certainly darker and every bit as engaging and entertaining.

Story-Line

Directed by Zack Snyder (300, Dawn of the Dead), ""Watchmen"" is based on a 12-issue limited series comic book created by writer Alan Moore, artist Dave Gibbons and colorist John Higgins, and published by DC Comics  in 1986 -1987.

The basic premise: someone is killing some of the ex-members of the superhero group The Watchmen formed before World War II.  They include Sally Jupiter/Silk Spectre (Carla Gugino ~ Snake Eyes, Spin City, Chicago Hope), Edward Blake/The Comedian (Jeffery Dean Morgan ~ Supernatural, P.S. I Love You, Grey's Anatomy), Hollis Mason/Night Owl (Stephen McHattie ~ Beauty and the Beast, Cold Squad, 2012).

Now it's left up to the new members of the recently disbanded Watchmen to find out who has it out for the good guy and why.  The new members include Laurie Jupiter/Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman ~ The Comeback, 27 Dresses, Couples Retreat), Dan Drieberg/Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson ~ Angels in America, Little Children, Lakeview Terrace), Walter Kovacs/Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley ~ Breaking Way, Little Children), and Dr. Manhattan/Jon Osterman (Billy Crudup ~ Waking the Dead, Almost Famous, The Good Shepherd).

The new team has been disbanded by order of President Nixon(?), who in this alternative universe has been elected to office five times!  Nonetheless, before the end of the movie three of the four Watchmen band together to battle Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias (Matthew Goode ~ Match Point, The Lookout), the ""smartest (and fastest) man in the world,"" as he hatches a sinister plot to save mankind from itself.

My Thoughts

Watchmen is thankfully rated ""R"" so you know the movie means business and will truly entertain in a manner befitting such a dark piece of work.  Director Zack Snyder brings to the movie that same sort of dark noir setting that made 300 (2006) such a critical success, complete with slow motion action sequences that really bring the viewer into the film.  I loved it in 300, and I love it here on ""Watchmen""

From where I sitting (and writing) there is nothing wrong with an occasional movie that shocks the senses, an adult movie with truckloads of gore, sessions and sessions worth of angst, superhero sex, unschooled, nails-on-a-blackboard narration, seriously fun fight scenes, and enough back-story to fill in even the most casual comic-book reader.  ""Watchmen"" delivers all of this and quite a bit more.

Slow in places, especially at the beginning, the 251 minutes movie nonetheless never fails to entertain, and do in spades once the action really ramps up.  ""Watchmen"" does an excellent job creating the dark, complex, alternate reality which unfolds like a bad nightmare, but don't shy away or you'll miss the rewards that come from a well-crafted adult-themed movie.  And I don't mean adult as in XXX, but a serious thinking man--and woman'--movie where the kiddies can be safely excluded.

But ""Watchmen"" isn't all darkness and grim faced, there is fun afoot as well in the guise of Pat Buchanan and Eleanor Clift arguing nuclear war on PBS's The McLaughlin Report.  Richard Nixon and his cabinet make frequent, if not hilarious appearances as larger than life bumbling idiots lazily taking the country to the brink of nuclear war.

Also look for Ted Koppel, JFK, Lee Iacocca and others to make cameos in this alternative landscape, wherein America won the Vietnam War (thanks to Dr. Manhattan), and the American Dream is a nightmare un vapid unfulfilled promises and the country is on the brink of self-destruction.

""Watchmen"" is one of those movies you really have to see at least twice to get the full effect and to soak in little things happing in the scenes you may have missed first time through.  So, I'll be watching the move again thanks to my trusty DVR.  Even if you watch it once, I think you'll be glad to you did.",1293580800,4,4771,4.932415519399249

I had never read the graphic novel but after a stellar review in the NY Post and having an afternoon to kill I went to see it and was totally blown away. So much so that I went back the next day to see it again while it was fresh in my mind. I have since read the graphic novel and have re-watched the movie perhaps ten times, most recently, the Director's Cut in Blue Ray. WOW!!! In some ways it is superior to the novel, most obviously in the fact that it is absolute eye-candy and I think the characterizations by the cast is exactly right. The scenes and music during the opening credits (Dylan singing, ""The Times They Are A-Changin'"") are worth the price of the disc alone.

After watching it I picked up the comics of it and read them as well as watched the graphic novels movie. After this, I had THE understanding of watchmen and it definitely made more sense. So when it came out on blu ray i was hesitate. Then I realized the director's cut is nearly an extra half hour of material in the film. This borught so much more to the film and offered much more understanding of the comics and overall story. Some might not be able to get into it, but believe me this movie is a work of art by the amazing director Zack Snyder and is so so intelligent. Please do not be immature due to male nudity. It's nothing we all haven't seen before, except its blue. Anywho, this one is hands down one of the best movies of 2009 for me, right up there with up in the air and star trek! I'd advise everyone to watch it that has a mature mind and can watch the full three hours of this epic film.

Also Zack Snyder has a new movie coming out in March 2011 called ""SuckerPunch"". Snyder said he wanted to create a movie with an all girl cast kicking tail like he did with the men from 300. In all honesty I respect him even more because he's doing this. I think its a pretty awesome idea and that the film will be nothing short of epic just like 300 and watchmen.

3575684,4,B001FB55H6,"This film, based on the graphic novels, seems to be draped in darkness with the exception of the blue glowing Dr. Manhattan. This use of darkness reminded me of the film Blade Runner but also reminded me of the paintings of the Renaissance where all characters are presented in darkness illuminated sometimes by strong light with the exception of Christ, often glowing as if illuminated from inside his body. Thus there are some loosely associated similarities to Christ entering a dark world which does not understand him and Dr. Manhattan's transformation and evolution and eventual distancing himself from the human condition and perspective as his vistas grow and he seems to take on the impersonal cognitions of a distant God.

The use of an alternative past as the setting for the film allowed for political commentary, particularly about political opportunism and short-sightedness, as evidenced in the character of Richard Nixon.

Yet in many ways it is also a film noir with all the dark puzzle pieces of a private detective film from the 1940's. There were some very strong performances including Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the Comedian, a superhero with strong sociopathic and violent tendencies. However Jackie Earle Haley steals the entire film with his outstanding performance as Rorschach. This bundle of pent up and everlasting rage is often more than the other heroes can endure. Haley's wild scenes in prison are worth the price of the film and his dialogue is darkly wicked. Billy Crudup plays Dr. Manhattan, a character that links Christ and physics in one character struggling to be both human and God. The character of Jesus has this same duality since Jesus is both God and human. Thus Dr. Manhattan struggles to remain attached to the human world and its emotional attachments while at the same time he is mastering the mysteries of the physical universe. Christ feels compassion for his fellow humans and it is this quality that Dr. Manhattan is losing or nearly loses in the film. There is much speculation around why Dr. Manhattan is naked with blue genitals. But this links him to Adam, for he is a first and unique being.  Malin Akerman is spectacular as Silk Spectre II, the force that eventually convinces Dr. Manhattan that the human race is worthy of redemption. Patrick Wilson plays Nite Owl II as the more human, humble competitor for Silk Spectre II's affection. He plays this part very well, rising to heroics gradually as his testosterone levels rise.  Matthew Goode never convinces us that Ozymandias was ever a team player with the other heroes so his later antics don't seem much like betrayal. The storyline is pure entertainment and draws from a thousand references and plots. It is predictable and yet the film is fully entertaining.",1290211200,3,2773,4.982721382289417

3575686,3,B001FB55H6,"I saw this movie in the theater on opening night.  I had never read the comic, and as it turned out I didn't need to.  I think a movie that is based on a book or graphic novel should stand on its own.  You shouldn't have to read the source material to be able to follow the plot of the movie.  Thankfully, this movie does stand on its own.  It is a good movie, and a mostly faithful comic book adaptation.  There are some problems I had with it, however.  It was a little too violent and sexy for my taste.  Some of this could have been toned down.  This movie is much more violent than the comic book.

I'll start with what I liked about the movie.  Nearly all the casting was excellent.  The two characters that would seem to be the hardest to capture on the screen are Rorshach and Doctor Manhattan.  The casting and the performances of these two characters were perfect.  Jackie Earle Haley is Rorschach in every way.  People complain about the raspy voice, but that's how I always imagined Rorschach's voice.  Billy Crudup is great as Doctor Manhattan.  Keanu Reeves was initially considered for the role, and I'm glad they didn't use him.  Doc Manhattan is supposed to be emotionless, not bland.  Crudup actually seems to be putting effort into his performance.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Patrick Wilson are both fine, and Matthew Goode is pretty good, although I got a little tired of his silky voice.  The only real complaint that I had was Malin Akerman, who played Silk Spectre II.  She was very wooden and one-dimensional.  But she is my least favorite character in the book anyway, so I really didn't mind.  Some fans of the comic complained that they cut too much out.  The only they left out that I thought they needed was Ozymandias's backstory.  When I saw the movie, I thought he had super powers.  See, I just recently got around to reading the comic.  In the comic, it explains how Adrian traveled the world and learned everything.  It would have been cool to see the street vendor, who does appear at the end, right before New York is destroyed.  The thing is, the movie was already 2  hours.  Other than the Ozymandias stuff, I was happy perfectly fine with everything they ended up cutting out.  I liked the ending, I thought it worked fine.  The squid is cut, obviously.  Some people have actually said they like this ending better than the ending of the comic.  I won't go that far, I will simply say I love both endings equally.

There were some things I did not like about this movie.  One problem was the action scenes.  The action scenes are spectacular, but they are not really supposed to be.  Every action scene from the book is blown up in this movie.  Reference, the fight scene in the jail.  In the book, there is one panel that shows Nite Owl and Silk Spectre each knocking out one guy.  In the movie, they take on about a dozen guys.  But they didn't make this an action movie, primarily, so it is not a huge problem.  I thought they made the movie a little too violent in some scenes.  Some examples are the part where Rorschach kills the pedofile, the mugging scene, or the part where one of the guys working for Big Figure inexplicably has a chain saw and he cuts...yeah.  I wish they hadn't felt the need to put the word F**k in almost every line of dialogue.  And that big sex scene in the ship did absolutely nothing to move the story line along.  This is a great adaptation, but the violence and language could have been toned down a little bit.",1288137600,,3486,4.422712933753943

3575692,3,B001FB55H6,"There is a lot of Superhero action in this movie. The who-dun-it aspect is simple to figure out. What really bogs the movie down is the stiff acting by everyone and the ever constant heavy themes of blurring good and evil. I ask you, can the Watchmen really be good guys if they allow Nixon to become president 5 terms and disco music to survive?

The movie does a poor job of introducing the characters. You are fed a pseudo history of the US with Watchmen during the opening credits. Once Bob Dylan is done playing, the movie starts and you are confused who the characters are. The relationship of the characters and their past deeds are relayed through flashback scenes, which in many cases were more interesting than the rest of the movie. The lack of character introduction wasn't as bad as ""Final Fantasy VII"" movie, but it is worse than what Tolkien did to us.

The Superheros, a vigilante group who murder women and children for their country (an early good/evil blur) are semi-retired as wearing masks became outlawed. Someone is killing off the Superheros and superhero Rorschach is the most determined to find out.

Dr. Manhattan (big blue guy, clothes optional)can't see into his future and has assumed we have annihilated each other. Meanwhile, Nixon and Kissinger are in the war room, in a scene which reminds us of Dr. Strangelove. They are debating a first strike.

If you like your superhero action mixed in with pseudo history, political statements, blurred good/evil themes/ atheist statements (The watch has no watch maker), and the slinky Silk Spectre being zipped out of her costume (some nudity) then this movie is for you.

If you like good acting, a well written chronological story, good dialogue, and a need to know the characters, and film editors past the third grade- go elsewhere.",1285286400,,1811,4.810289389067524

I mention this at first because for all Blu-ray fans and Watchmen lovers, this one is region-free and thus can be enjoyed on your local, non-American player. Second important bit of information: this particular version of the movie is no longer available and must be purchased - often for a premium- from second-hand dealers.
It was released after the movie as a ""treat"" for hardcore&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Watchmen/dp/1401219268/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Watchmen</a>&nbsp;fans longing for the complete, frame-by-frame adaptation of the beloved Moore/Gibbons/Higgins (those surreal colors!) classic. I don't think I need to get into the whole development hell saga with the Gilliams and whatnots attached to this supposedly impossible-to-adapt-story.
What you get here, if you can get it (this is written 09/21/2010), is the ""ultimate cut"" of the already 2.5 hrs adaptation of the comics which adds up to a big fat 3.35 hours of viewing. The added elements include most notably the animated version of the ""Tale of the Black freighter"" mirroring (spoiler!) Ozymandias' descent into moral murkiness.
This is a five-star review because the film is simply too beautiful to watch. The editing (the animated sequences especially are beautifully integrated), the casting, the photography and the attention given to respecting the original are top-notch. But I do have some criticisms which to me bar this from being a true classic:
- first, slavishly transfering the composition of each scene on the screen does not automatically translate the feeling associated with that scene. Although I have been quite entranced at each viewing, I'm always left with a certain emotional void. That is due to a lack of real feeling of foreboding. Plus no-one seems to be actually touched by the events unfolding. Concerned maybe, but not touched. And this is not due to the superb cast. All the right ingredients are there, but my feeling is that the cook failed to let all the flavors intermingle and express the true ambition of this particular dish (sorry, French love of food taking over!)
- The second aspect that I realized bothered me on subsequent viewing: the music. Once again, a collage of great songs and pieces does not a great soundtrack make. Case in point: I love Philip Glass and the piece played during the Mars scene - but I'd have loved an  original, equally grandiose piece, that the director could have pushed for in his vision with his own composer (there is one for the movie: Tyler Bates).
All in all, I think this is a great movie, but kind of an empty shell with all the right beats save for the ache of losing friends, the torment of past, present and ... future regrets or the feeling of impending doom that prevaded the original comics.
Finally, although this version is great, my belief is that most casual fans can survive with the theater or director's cuts.",1285027200,2,2954,5.167014613778706

3575873,4,B001FB55H6,"First off let me say I am an absolute die hard Watchmen fan. Getting this ultimate cut was a must have in my book. I purchased my copy directly from Amazon (there were 2 minor tears in the case but i eventually cried myself to sleep enough times to shrug it off).

This copy includes the following: The complete motion comic (6 chapters/comics/episodes on the first disc and the other 6 on the second disc), the ultimate cut of Watchmen (this disc includes Tales of the Black Freighter plus commentaries from Snyder and illustrator Gibbons), Special features (this was actually pretty interesting and i do recommend you at least watch it once), and then theres the theatrical digital copy for your pc and mac.

The special feature does include Hollis Mason's Under the Hood which is included in the Tales of a Black Freighter dvd (last time I was at Borders I recall this dvd being around $34.00 completely not worth it for just those items.) Sadly I haven't gotten around to watching it.

As far as the digital copy goes there was an expiration. Mine is Nov. 3, 2010. Theres really no reason for this disc imho.

I absolutely loved the movie despite the fact that osterman was the cause. It wouldn't have made sense to other movie goers why *spoiler alert* there was a giant alien monster with a human brain destroying NY. *spoiler end* I loved how Snyder kept the main story alive with a different plot twist. And yes the movie still ends the same as the comic.

The motion comic is beautifully done besides silk spectre's man voice.

The only thing I didn't like was how long the movie drawed out for because of Tales of the Black Freighter! At first I thought I was going to be awesome but it almost felt like Lord of the Rings long.

Overall I'd give this copy a solid 4.5 (only did a 4 cuz here weren't that many 4 reviews) I was very satisfied by the quality, and the overall experience (did i mention the 3 discs not including the motion comic has its very own case within a case?)

In the comic, two detectives piece together the murder of the Comedian - we see only flashes of the event, preserving the mystery of the Comedian's character and his killer. In the film, a 5-minute fight scene.
Rorshach, horrified by a killer's brutality, handcuffs the killer to a stove then burns down his house. In the film, Rorshach takes a meat cleaver and repeatedly chops on him.
The Owl and Sally Jupiter begin kissing in Archie (Owl's ship) - then, fade. In the film - a full sex scene.
Veidt kills half of New York teleporting an artificially created alien; implying that humankind has a greater threat than each other. Veidt cries over this sacrifice. In the film, Veidt kills millions upon millions all over the world and barely changes his voice. He seems more mad than calculating.

In most every scene, Director Zack Synder emphasizes the visceral thrill over the psychologically complex in Alan Moore's Hugo-winning mystery. Do yourself a favor: read the comic instead and marvel at Alan Moore's complex, layered writing where boyish, testosterone-ish thrills are tossed aside for penetrating character drama.

3575909,5,B001FB55H6,"Watchmen, the graphic novel by Alan Moore upon which Watchmen, the film, was based has a huge cult following. From the DC Comics Vertigo line, it is a comic book for adults. Not just because of the graphic violence, and graphic, if not quite pornographic, sex, but also because of the philosophical, psychological, and the historical content. Allusions to Aristotle and Allen Ginsberg's Howl are mixed with cultural references to Lee Iacocca, JFK, and Richard Milhous Nixon. Laced with post-modern irony throughout, we have a comedian with a very perverse sense of humor; a sociopath vigilante whose face is an ever shifting Rorschach pattern; a physicist endowed with strange powers after a tragic accident and ominously named Dr. Manhattan; and another who takes his name from the famous sonnet Ozymandias by Percy Bysshe Shelley.

-------------------
Adrian Veidt / Ozymandias: I don't mind being the smartest man in the world; I just wish it wasn't this one.
==========

The climactic scenes of Watchmen take place in 1985, but it is a parallel universe to our reality with a few interesting twists: Masked and caped super heroes are a part of everyday life, and have been since before WWII. Nixon doesn't resign in disgrace after Watergate, but serves for three terms. Nixon uses Dr. Manhattan as a secret weapon to win the war in Viet Nam, and Viet Nam becomes the 51st state of the U.S. The U.S. is on the brink of nuclear war with Russia, and the tension is higher than it was at the height of The Cold War.

--------------
Dan Dreiberg / Nite Owl II: What happened to us? What happened to the American Dream?
Edward Blake / Comedian: ""What happened to the American Dream?"" It came true! You're lookin' at it...
==========

Though Alan Moore preemptively disowns all filmed adaptations of his work, I can't imagine a more faithful adaptation. I admit that I haven't read the graphic novel, but that will soon change. Meanwhile, you can see that a lot of the storyboard shots were taken from the comic's panels, and not only the story, but the original artwork was respected. I love the look of the film, a kind of gritty realism that wove the superheroes seamlessly into the tapestry of their times. The 40's era scenes were true to their period, and likewise, the scenes in the 80's also captured the 80's zeitgeist. I love Nite Owl II's Owl Craft, the way it looked as it cruised over the city, those big round windows like the owl's eyes. The only false note for me was Dr. Manhattan sometimes looked like an animation superimposed over live action--which I suppose he was. Still you could tell that they used some very sophisticated special effects, trying some new things that almost worked, but most worked spectacularly well. And Dr. Manhattan, put on some pants!

-------------------
Laurie Juspeczyk / Silk Spectre II: The most powerful thing in the universe... still just a puppet.
Jon Osterman / Dr. Manhattan: We are all puppets, Laurie. I'm just the puppet who can see the strings.
==========

I have to hand it to Director Zack Snyder and the cast. Especially Malin kerman as Laurie Jupiter / Silk Spectre II and Patrick Wilson as Dan Dreiberg / Nite Owl II. The scenes where they suit up in their superhero costumes and cruise the night in the Owl Craft, which was for them a kind of aphrodisiac, were excellent. It brought to mind a similar scene in The Losers, also highly recommended, where Jeffery Dean Morgan (who plays The Comedian in Watchmen) and Zo Saldana also use fighting as foreplay. Patrick Wilson not only captures the heat, he also portrays Dan Dreiberg as a stodgy middle aged fuddy duddy when he is not in his Nite Owl II costume. Malin kerman is excellent both here and in scenes with Billy Crudup's Dr. Manhattan, who is growing increasingly distracted by the threat of a nuclear Armageddon, and more and more detached from any human connections. Laurie is a complicated woman, who also has major issues with her mother, Sally Jupiter / Silk Spectre, played by Carla Gugino. Don't even get me started on her Daddy issues.

Still, when it comes to major issues, no one tops Jackie Earle Haley as Walter Kovacs / Rorschach. His name refers to the Rorschach inkblot test used in psychotherapy, and he wears a mask with an ever shifting Rorschach pattern on it. He doesn't call it a mask. He calls it his face. Rorschach channels his sociopathic urges into vigilante actions, like Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver. Like Travis Bickle, he waits for that Someday. ""Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets.""

-------------------
Walter Kovacs / Rorschach: The streets are extended gutters and the gutters are full of blood and when the drains finally scab over, all the vermin will drown. The accumulated filth of all their sex and murder will foam up about their waists and all the whores and politicians will look up and shout ""Save us!""... and I'll whisper ""no.""
==========

Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian and Matthew Goode as Ozymandias round out the band of Watchmen, and Alan Moore, though he has vowed never to watch the film, couldn't ask for a better portrayal of his characters. I was ready to write off Jeffrey Dean Morgan after first seeing him on Grey's Anatomy, especially when his character came back as a ghost, but thankfully I gave him a chance here. He was excellent as The Comedian, though he never told a single joke. Maybe that was the punch line. He is also a winner in The Losers.

-------------------
Edward Blake / Comedian: Once you realize what a joke everything is, being the Comedian is the only thing that makes sense.
==========

Director Zack Snyder made excellent choices in music, using several iconic songs that could almost be too powerful and distract or overwhelm the narrative were they not placed in exactly the right time and place. Three Dylan songs: Blowin' In The Wind done by Dylan, but All Along The Watchtower in the famous Jimi Hendrix version and Desolation Row done by My Chemical Romance. Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen has been used in countless films, but nowhere as appropriate as here. We also get 99 Luftballoons by Nena, The Sounds of Silence by Simon and Garfunkle, and Boogie Man by K.C. and the Sunshine Band! Get down tonight!

-------------------
Walter Kovacs / Rorschach: Man bursts into tears. Says, ""But doctor... I am Pagliacci."" Good joke. Everybody laugh. Roll on snare drum. Curtains.
==========

The bottom line is Watchmen is a very watchable movie that combines comic book action with deeper, more adult themes. In a perfect world it would be watched by more people, but it appeals strongly to its cult audience, kids who have grown up on comic books, and who still enjoy reading comic books, but demand a more sophisticated, grown up story.

-------------------
Jon Osterman / Dr. Manhattan: They claim their labors are to build a heaven, yet their heaven is populated by horrors. Perhaps the world is not made. Perhaps nothing is made. A clock without a craftsman. It's too late. Always has been, always will be. Too late.

3575910,1,B001FB55H6,"I went into Watchmen with high expectations because I know that it's suppose to be like the best graphic novel ever. but I was not only horribly disappointed, but utterly disgusted.
Watchmen is a film filled with over the top preachy narration and lines with little storyline advancement because of all the flashbacks and tries to make you understand the alternate history, that the first 3/4 of the film you have absolute no idea what it's trying to get at (unless, of course you are familiar with the graphic novel it's based upon). Then at the end you realize that it's the same old same old (though only universaly WESTERN idealism):

* human beings are inheritantely corrupt (thanks alot)
* peace can only be achieved through catastrophe, in other words, without apocalyse or apocalyptical events, there can only be war (which I only agree to the degree that if you kept trying to convince people this, the religious fundies ought to be VERY HAPPY when they see this film)
* There has to be a god-like scapegoat for it to be happen, and it's gonna be American (sorry Jesus Christ), and he will not actually be responsible for the apocalypse, only scapegoating it (ergo: if some God-like creature destroyed the entire human race, it's probably not his fault but corrupt human beings')

last but not least that made me most angry:
*women: if you got pregnant from rape, you should ALWAYS have the kid, because the kid will always turn out to be the best thing that ever happen to you.

I have to admit that Watchmen hides its clichedness well, it wasn't until the very end did I actually realize all this. But there was a point in which I thought it might head into a though-provoking direction, that it might actually get at a point that makes you go ""hmm... interesting,"" and that's when Dr. Manhattan raise the conscience: what is so special about the lives of human beings, or lives in general, most part of galaxy (or universe if you'll make that assumption that earth is unique with life) get along just fine without life.

Interestingly good point, cool, that made me think for a moment

then it got destroyed by the bottom-of-the barrel foolish ""epiphany"" of Dr. Manhattan that he should save human race because of Silk Spectral number two, because she is something good that came out of chaos. Therefore life must be special if ""good life"" can come out of chaos.

If you just sit there and think this though for a moment you'll see that this logic makes absolutely NO SENSE WHATSOEVER. Why? because if you already take the assumption that all lives (and non-lives) are equal, as Dr. M suggests because he's so high and mighty and all that, then how would ""rape"" be catagorized as ""chaos?"" Rape and rape-like things happen often in the animal and, some would argue, plant and bacterial kingdom. It's only the fact that rape brings suffering to human beings, and we, the human beings, must PERCEIVE it as chaos because it brings suffering to us (mostly the women), will makes it ""chaos."" So you must assume that:
1. there's something special and non-chaotic (good) about human lives
2. Rape brings suffering/chaos
therefore conclusion:
3. rape is chaotic.

So this sudden ""epiphany"" of Dr. M basically just came out of nowhere, maybe it's because he does believe that human lives are special but just doesn't wanna show it since he's god and all that and it's just too humiliating and difficult to suffer in love in his condition. Not to mention after all the talk of anti-life, he's actually pro-life (not even pro-choice)!!

A friend suggested to me that (he has read the graphic novel) the point is the irony: corrupted human beings (the watchmen) are the ones to rise above to save the human race.
interesting but whether or not the graphic novel perserves this idea, the movie certainly does not. Why? because the watchmen (in the movie) who actually fought the crimes either did it to appease their own vanity (to be like pharohs, to bring divine justice) or did it for thrills (which is like most of them). Hey apocalypse is coming, what better way to spend your Last Days then to have sex and kick some butt? Dude I would totally go for it.

Overall this film is painful to watch, especially for humanists/feminists like me. The only thing I learned from this film is that kept getting people paranoid about world-ending does it's self-fufilling prophecy thing.

3575986,2,B001FB55H6,"This dvd version is the theatrical release - not the director's cut.  As far as this version is concerned, it is about an hour too long.  I'm kind of amazed I saw this film and dozed off only once for about a five minute period, which I replayed after waking up.

I did read the mini-series when it came out 20 years ago, but have long forgotten the details, so no worries about me comparing the two in this review.

This movie is set in an alternate history, where Nixon is still President in 1985, and the threat of the Cold War turning hot is still real. In this world, superheroes are into forced retirement.  One, the Comedian, is murdered.  Another, Rorschach investigates as he feels that all the ex-superheroes are in danger. The background story is that the Cold War is heating up and President Nixon keeps moving the DefCon level lower. Kudos for keeping both themes relevant to the story to the end.

This isn't a stereotypical comic book action film, it is a crime/suspense drama that involve comic book characters.  On a deeper layer, the movie examines the theme: Does the end justify the means.

The actors and actresses did a pretty good job with fleshing out their characters, so they all had nice distinct personalities, though you can clearly see the Clint Eastwood ""references"" with Rorschach. It's with Rorschach that the movie does the character best. With the exception of Dr. Manhattan, there was no character development, and that was minimal and some of the scenes were redundant in force feeding the viewer into his character flaws. Thus, I thought some of the scenes that set up the relationships the characters have with each other were unneccessary.  I also found these scenes to be slow.

The last hour of the film was good. You have action, suspense, and the tying up of the loose ends.  Dr. Manhattan's character growth also occurs during this hour and Rorschach and Nite Owl's short exhanges with each other add to their characters.

The movie also starts off good, with a murder scene and the introduction of a protagonist (Rorschach)who suspects a conspiracy to eliminate a group of people.  It's just the middle part that is a struggle, and this movie gets a two because the boring part is about 90 minutes, equivelant to a shorter theatrical release film.",1275696000,2,2293,4.728643216080402
3575987,5,B001FB55H6,"When this movie originally was released in theatres, I decided to wait until the actual director's cut came out. Mainly because I wanted to get the fully idealized version of the film, and because I wanted to avoid all the Watchmen review civil wars that were going on at the time.

Anyway so as for the movie itself, this is based on Alan Moore's groundbreaking comic book maxi-series from the 80s(everyone forgets it was a comic 1ST and a graphic novel 2ND!). Moore wanted nothing to do with it, because he's had a bear up his butt ever since the last couple of movie fiascos based on his works(Constantine, From Hell, League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen). But Zack Snyder came along and made this sucker work. For the longest time, the project was plagued with doubt because no one really had any faith that it could be made into a coherent story. The mature nature of The Dark Knight helped cement the idea that not all superhero movies need to be corny action flicks

The story is set in an alternate history during 1985. Nixon is STILL President, and Congress has put a ban on superheroes. The Comedian, a former hero from a group called Watchmen, is mysteriosly murdered. Rorschach, the only active hero, sets out to find his killer. What follows is a look into the background of all these now-retired heroes. Nite-Owl is dreaming of his glory days, Silk Spectre tries to live a life away from her mother while comforting Dr. Manhattan(the only one with powers), and Ozymandias is creating a new type of energy source with his vast fortune. However, Rorschach gets framed for killing an ex-villain. Nite-Owl hooks up with Silk Spectre, and frees Rorschach, while Dr. Manhattan is cooling off on Mars because he is blamed for giving his former friends cancer. It turns out the entire thing was a plot by Ozymandias set to stop the nations of the world from going into nuclear war. A final confrontation between the remaning heroes results in them going along with Ozymandias' idea, despite all the deaths it caused, except for Rorscach who ends up as snow pizza.

Despite all the fanboy gripe that this movie got, there was an equal amount of praise for it. Most people's expectations got a little to high though, thinking that a Rated-R superhero movie would stay in the #1 spot for very long, which is unfortunate because that's how ALOT of jerks are going to insist on looking at it years from now. I thought the film as a whole captured all the important aspects of the original story, at least alot better than some other comic-based movies. This new Director's Cut brings some additional footage that was left out of the theatrical edition which adds more clarity to the plot, plus some scenes that weren't included at all like the death of the original Nite-Owl. I'd recommend getting this, BIGTIME.",1274918400,2,2810,4.718940936863544
3575988,5,B001FB55H6,"Firstly yes, I was a fan of the graphic novel before the movie was announced. That being said I liked the watchmen movie from the beginning with the theatrical version. Honestly people, the change in the ending just isn't that big a deal, they were trying to make the ending more appealing to those who were new to the Watchmen and it honestly makes sense too. They cut some things I wish they hadn't but that's what has to happen in the movie biz. The director's cut added a lot of important scenes back to the movie. I also enjoyed Tales of the Black Freighter. The Ultimate Cut takes the two and combines them and then some. The Black Freighter is split up and spliced in to the directors cut at about the right times. Doing this allowed the news stand scenes to be added back in, which was great. This is a long movie at about 3 and a half hours but it doesn't feel overly long. It looks like it has some great special features that I haven't checked out yet, and, of course, the digital copy that I will never use. The packaging is great, very high quality and much better than I was expecting given Amazon's thumbnail.

3575989,2,B001FB55H6,"It's tempting to dismiss this film by saying that any movie made from such a poor novel would /have/ to be an improvement. And it /is/ an improvement, which explains my two-star review of the film (compared to my one-star review of the novel -- QV, as they say in Latin).

No one has had the guts to stand up and say that the novel is a shallow and ultimately pointless work. The issues raised by ""Watchmen"" were raised more than 70 years ago when Superman and Batman became the prototypes of almost every superhero to come. They need little elaboration, any more than one needs to be told that water is wet. Dr Wertham was wrong about comic books causing anti-social behavior, but he and other philosophers/psychologists correctly analyzed why super-heroes are (for better or worse) popular.

There are no real-world superheros (as much as people like Ronald Reagan might like to think there are), which therefore renders super-hero comics a self-contained and self-referential commentary on themselves and society. A commentary /on/ a commentary, from a comic-book writer, seems pointless navel-gazing. My reaction to the novel was largely ""Yeah, right... So what?"".

The film blunts much (but not enough) of the novel's intellectual pretentiousness, while discarding too much of its moral ambiguity. We are left feeling that Ozymandias was justified in killing millions of people to prevent a much greater catastrophe. And the idea that the governments of the Earth would unite against a common foe and stop fighting among themselves is not plausible. ""The Shield of Achilles"" gives a not-unreasonable explanation of the sources of human warfare, which would not be long-suppressed by an alien enemy. *

The film's dialog is not far-removed from the novel's, which is unfortunate. It's not at the level of Stephen J Cannell, let alone ""The Sopranos"". The acting is barely adequate, with Malin Ackerman decidedly unconvincing. The actor playing Nixon has been given a prosthetic nose that makes him look as if he's auditioning for a production of ""Cyrano"".

Ultimately, I find ""Watchmen"" not so much pointless as a shallow rehash of the patently obvious. It holds your attention, though, and its 3-hour running time passes quickly and smoothly.

""Watchmen"" is an extremely violent film, which I don't consider suitable for anyone under 17 or 18, even with parents in attendance. There are scenes of two dogs fighting over the leg bone of a little girl they've torn to pieces, and a convict having his arms cut off with a circular saw. A decade ago, these would likely have gotten the film an NC-17. And people complain about ""Brokeback Mountain"".

3576153,2,B001FB55H6,"I actually saw this movie in the theater, but I never got around to writing a review of it. This one is well overdue.

For those who love this type of movie, you'll probably fall for this one too. After all, it has spectacular special effects we've all come to expect from the adaptation of these graphic novels. (My personal favorite is, of course, 300 because it tell a story I find intriguing, and the acting, as well as special effects, is superb.)

However, I found this one to be disappointing. In the opening scene, one of the super heroes, one of the Watchmen is murdered. Great start for the movie, but for about the next 45 mintues, (I timed it), we're inundated with the background of these people and what happened in the past. As if the script writer didn't know what to do next, we get a graphic, and way too long and unnecessary sex scene. Finally we're propelled back into the action of the story.

What made this movie so hard to watch was all of the background information crammed into the beginning of the story. Why not weave those details in and tell them to us as the story progressed? Also, the sex scene was completely unnecessary. I get it. These two people were attracted to one another. So what? How did it contribute to the story? It didn't.

If you like this kind of movie, you'll enjoy it. I gave this movie a low rating not because it was necessarily bad, but simply because I rated it according to the ratings: I didn't like it. It was money I wasted on watching a movie I didn't find worth watching.",1273363200,,1532,4.383802816901408

3576155,3,B001FB55H6,"I watched The Watchmen in the theatres and left very disappointed.  After watching it on DVD/Blu-ray/PPV a few times, I have revised my opinion ... a little bit.

I never read The Watchmen comic book.  I have read MANY comic books, over the last 30+ years and maintain a 1200+ book collection.  As a devoted comic book fan, I ass-u-me'd that The Watchmen was a ""normal"" comic book that would be the basis for a typical comic book movie.  I was very, very wrong.

Ironically, the character that exhibits the most classic heroic qualities is the one that everyone else in the movie calls insane:  Rorschach.  He is ""compelled"" to fight evil.  He can't turn his back on it, once he was brutally exposed to it.  Jackie Earle Haley does an AMAZING acting job.  I would have been quite happy if this was just a Rorschach movie.

The Comedian is a rapist and a cold blooded murder.  He rapes a fellow super hero.  He cold bloodedly shoots a pregnant woman (carrying HIS child) in the head.  His version of crowd control is to start beating people to a pulp, including a woman again, and then shooting the unarmed people with a shotgun.  HE is the hero??!!  The Comedian exhibits all of the traits of a classic villian.

There are two ""normal/average"" super heroes that don't really have any super powers, akin to Batman.  They seem like classic, good heroes ... until they wander into an alley and proceed to brutally maim and kill a bunch of muggers.  Bizarrely, they exhibit super strength when fighting, which I never really understood.

Mr. Manhattan is a virtual God.  He gets cranky and atomizes a bunch (20?) of people trying to interview him on live tv.  I sympathize with his view of the obnoxious media, but I don't think their murder is justified.  Mr. Manhattan also acts very non-God like, when he cheats on his aging girlfriend with a younger, better looking girl. (Not unlike the actor who portrays him, Billy Crudup, who dumped his pregnant girlfriend for the someone ""hotter"").

The super hero/villian Ozymandias is billed as the smartest man in the world.  Oddly, that also makes him the fastest and apparently super strong also.  His goal is logical, of saving mankind, but brutal. Killing millions of people isn't the option that pops into most super hero's brains.  Why he is killing ALL retired super heroes, after one (The Comedian ... what a bizarre name for a brutal, sadistic psychopath) discovers his evil plan is unclear.

Seeing the movie again, at home, made me appreciate details of the film even though my overall opinion of the film didn't change.  As I said, Jackie Earle Haley's Rorschach is magnificent (and makes me want to see him recreate Freddy Krueger in the new Nightmare on Elm Street.  Based on Rorschach he will be great).  I hadn't remembered all of his performance from when I saw the movie in the theatre.  His interview with the prison psychiatrist really showed why he was a super hero.  He was eloquent and passionate and believable.  Rorschach's final death scene was heart wrenching to watch.  Mr. Haley is simply great.

After repeated viewings, I admired the visual style of the film, which was extremely well done.  As others have said, the opening credits are great.  The flashback's during Hollis Mason's fight to the death are perfectly interspersed with the ""live"" action.  It was clear that Hollis, as the original Nite Owl, was a formidable man.  If he wasn't so outnumbered, I'm sure the ""old man"" would have won that fight.

Overall, parts of the movie (Rorschach and the visual style) are very good, but funamentally the movie was not good.  Other reviews have said that the characters are ""human"" and ""flawed"".  When the ""heroes"" are so flawed that they are villians, something is very, very wrong.",1273190400,,3757,4.74922600619195

With that out of the way lets make it clear this ""Ultimate cut"" has been made specifically for the hardcore Watchmen fans, this movie weaves the ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" side story directly into the extended edition release, its as close as you can get to the graphic novel with out actually reading it, the movie clocks in at just under 4 hours, again if you loved the novel you'll watch every second of it.

It comes really nicely packaged in a all-in-one box with two slide out cases, one containing the Graphic novel motion comic, which is a nice rendition of the graphic novel in its original art work and narrated this disc clocks in at five hours because it is read page by page right on your screen, and the second case is what contains the actaul live action movie and a second disc that has all the speacial features you would come to expect with a package of this kind, all in all a well thought out package to proudly display in your collection.

There also is a third disc that contains a digital copy of the theatrical version of the movie(not the Ultimate cut that comes packaged inside),

3576223,5,B001FB55H6,"An extremely hard to film to categorize.
I have to be honest and admit that as a movie is not as great as Nolan's Batman films. But as an all around experience is vast superior.
Snyder basically took out sections of the comic book panel by panel and converted them into live action and that is the reason why some people felt that it wasn't complete because Snyder couldn't possibly put everything into the film. Yes he did alter some sections of it but I think they were little compared to the whole scope of the project and ultimately reach the same conclusions as the book.

One of my favorite scene in the film is Dr. Manhattan creation, chapter IV on the book. I remember getting chills while reading it on the book and watching it in live action gave it realism that creep the hell out of me. Even the music is a lone church organ sound that haunts you long after he is over talking.

The intro is also a work of genius and we have to credit Snyder here because in 10 minutes he was able to encapsulate the whole back story of the Watchmen mythology while interlacing it with real events. Thus setting the stage for the events to come.

But what is probably the best thing in the movie is Rorschach,there is absolutely nobody who could have played him better than Jackie Earle Haley. In my book his Rorschach is up there with Ledger's ""The Joker"".

Chances are you probably be better off reading the comic book first so you can appreciate the film better. I know I did and almost all my friends who didn't found it pointless while the few guys who read it loved the film.

The morally ambiguous ending which seems to be the mode now a days I find tedious.

The Black Freighter, however, was incredibly annoying.  I didn't like it in the graphic novel and I hated it in the movie.

The extra animated Black Freighter footage in the ""Ultimate Cut"" version added ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to the Watchmen story and actually took away from the movie.
  I really liked the theatrical version of the Watchmen so I bought Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut thinking that surely it would have lots of deleted scenes and the addition of the Black Freighter would enhance the story.  As far as I can tell the Black Freighter had nothing to do with the Watchmen.  It was just a comic book that a teen in the movie was reading.  [If pressed for time skip to next paragraph] The only connection I could see with the Black Freighter portions was it dealt with obsession to the point of self destruction which was a theme in the Watchmen.  The problem is that the extra animated portions just slowed the movie down and took you away from what you paid to see.  Actually it was like hitting PAUSE throughout the movie to stop and talk about a completely different movie.  The Black Freighter should not even be called the Watchmen.
  Unfortunately you end up paying a ridiculous amount of money for a movie that is actually two separate and competing movies.  If you pay full price for this ""Ultimate Cut"" version you will be extremely disappointed.
  To be fair the Black Freighter was a decent piece of animation but it needs to be a separate movie that is not associated with the Watchmen.  The story however is rather predictable.  It's essentially Heavy Metal meets Pirates of the Caribbean.",1268524800,7,1659,4.652920962199313

3576232,5,B001FB55H6,"As a graphic novel ""Watchmen"" is often cited as possibly/definitively the greatest graphic novel ever produced. A book with so mighty a reputation would require nothing short of a miracle to be translated successfully into a feature film.

While I do not believe in miracles I do believe that something very similar happened:  director Zack Snyder helmed just such a project, the end result being a film that is as true to the source material as one could realistically hope for. I consider this true to the point of committing what some might see as sacrilege by never again reading the graphic novel in favor of this cinematic experience.

Snyder's stylistic approach serves the story splendidly, often perfectly reproducing scenes from the acclaimed graphic novel not because the fans would demand it but because he obviously loves the book.

The cast--the entire cast, no exceptions--delivers performances true to their characters' graphic novel counterparts. Jackie Earle Haley is especially impressive in his role as Rorschach.

The film's atmosphere is established beautifully through scenery, an amazing score and an interesting song selection for the soundtrack--the final touch on what is without a doubt a solid and exciting film.

For the Ultimate Cut edition, a handful of sequences--often pieces of scenes already in the movie--and the previously left-out Tales of the Black Freighter are added to the already amazing theatrical cut. The extra scenes and bits further the fullness of the adaptation. The Black Freighter scenes can be jarring at first due to these sequences being animated, but this soon makes sense according to the following logic: The Black Freighter exists within the world of Watchmen as a comic book that is being read by a New York youth; while live-action would have been nice, animation makes sense a comic book can be thought of as a frame-by-frame cartoon wherein the reader fills in the between-the-panels action with his or her imagination, and thus animation resembles what most people see in their heads when reading comics. The dark and brooding nature of the Freighter sequences is well-rendered, with excellent voice work from Gerard Butler. The only problem here is the importance of the Freighter story might not be as evident without having read the graphic novel beforehand, as the graphic novel makes that importance more obvious.

Nevertheless, the Ultimate Cut completes Zack Snyder's vision of bringing the Watchmen in its entirety to film and is worth buying for that alone. However, this box set also includes a second disc of intriguing bonus features (some of which are set within the fictional world of the film and enhance the experience), a third disc containing a digital copy of the theatrical cut (which I find useless; I will likely replace this disc with the theatrical release dvd) and the 2-disc Complete Motion Comic, all within a nifty box.

3576334,4,B001FB55H6,"Who watches the Watchmen?  I did, and you should too.

Leading up to the seeing the film, I watched the motion comic, which is a word-for-word animation of the graphic novel minus some interstitial material.  It had been many years since I read the comic and I really didn't remember anything.  Wow, the story is so great.  It puts most every other comic I've ever read to shame.  I love Watchmen.

The movie is very close to the comic.  Many scenes of the movie are also word-for-word with the graphic novel.  There are a couple of relatively minor changes and one major change in the ending that, as you will see if you visit such forums, is hotly debated.  A lot of fans of the comic hate the change that was made but I don't think it's that big a deal.  The spirit of the ending remains the same - the change is in some ways more of a mechanical one, and in other ways I even think it works better than the way it was in the comic.  You'll have to decide that for yourself if you are a big fan of the comic.

The movie itself is very well done.  The directing is great, as are the special effects.  Most of the actors are good.  The guy who plays Rorschach is particularly excellent in his role and really brought the character to life.  There is one particular detractor here - Malin Akerman plays Silk Spectre II and her acting is rather uneven.  By uneven I mean that she's great when she is quiet and I'm looking at her, and even better when she is naked.  When she starts talking, that's when we run into problems.  Big parts of the plot revolve around her character and she's just not good enough to pull off the emotional scenes required.  She is the sole reason for a 4 star rating instead of 5.

My recommendation is definitely to see Watchmen.",1267574400,3,1757,4.276595744680851

It is set in an alternate reality in 1985, where Nixon has been reelected for a 3rd term, the U.S. and U.S.S.R. are on the brink of nuclear war, and masked vigilantes are outlawed. The movie opens with the murder of one of those vigilantes and what appears as a plot to kill old superheroes turns out to be so much more. This movie is a great mystery, action, thriller disguised as a comic book movie. The story challenges you to think about society, liberalism, violence and morality as you ponder the possibilities of ""what if superheroes existed?"" If so, what would they be like and how would they act with all that power. The R rating is well deserved and young kids shouldn't be watching this.

3576338,3,B001FB55H6,"Geez, it looks like in April we will be getting the official ""Watchmen: The 'This is really the final cut, I'm serious guys' Cut"". Or so I thought. I am a huge fan of the Watchmen universe- I read the graphic novel twice, I saw the movie on opening night at the theatre, I bought the Director's Cut on Blu-Ray when it got released. Then I went and bought this when it got released. Greed getting the best of me, I think so.

I was pretty damn amazed when I saw it in the theater. Then when I got it on Blu-Ray, I felt like I had seen a totally different movie (in a good way) with it being the director's cut- It had better pacing, an extra 23 minutes to tie the loose ends, and in the end it was a satisfaction. And then I got this.

For one, the packaging is nice and lovely to hold and look at, and to disassemble it is exciting too, just like when the director's cut of Sin City got released back in 2005, which came with the graphic novel, which was a nice little classy touch. However, in terms of content, this is nothing new. It is essentially the director's cut with ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" shoved in there.

The problem with it is that it's just unnecessary. TOTBF does nothing but just extends its length, and not in a good way. The movie was already long enough with the 3 hour 6 minute Director's cut. The runtime of the Ultimate Cut is 212 minutes, almost an hour longer than the theatre cut. And the TOTBF just creates an awkward transition from the movie scenes to the animated scenes. Every time the TOTBF scenes come in, they take you out of the movie, thus makeing it hard to enjoy.

Another problem is that the TOTBF scenes ruin any ambiguity there is to Veidt's plan. It basically tells whoever hasn't seen the movie and is watching it for the first time that Veidt's plan is doomed to fail- that he will murder 15 million people and try to cover it up by making Dr. Manhattan look responsible. It also tries to spoonfeed the ""good versus evil"" cliche to kids under 12 watching the movie. Rorschach good! Veidt bad! The comic let you decide who's good/bad, yet the UC spoonfeeds it to you.

Picture quality is amazing (and I am speaking for both the DC and the UC here since they both have the same picture quality); I remember when The Dark Knight came out on blu-ray and people were oh-so-swayed by its supposedly amazing picture quality yet I couldn't get my mind past the failed attempts to recapture the IMAX scenes, the distracting edge enhancement and the shifting F-stop in some scenes. Whereas Watchmen looks vintage and sharp- a lovely film grain enhances the 80s feel of the movie, the colors are really vibrant (especially in the Dr. Manhattan scenes and Laurie's coat in the ""Forest room"" interrogation scenes). The Audio is fantastic too- though not different than the DC.

In short, it is worth purchasing, but for the packaging only.",1266710400,65,2877,4.418867924528302

I loved ""Watchmen"" I thought it was a great film, and absolutely had to buy this when it came out. But honestly this cut is bad. The ""Black Freighter"" fit in well with the comic but in his film it feels cheap and out of place. They just did not adapt it well to the plot and I found that the animation looked pretty poor compared to the amazingly high quality of this film. I enjoyed the director's cut much more.

Pros: -Great boxset, made it worth keeping. Beautiful and high quality box and pictures.
-The digital copy is of the directors cut.
-Bonus materials are nice and plentiful.

Cons: -The animation sucked, and was distracting to this great film.
  - The animated cut is the only cut of the film available in this set.

The only reason I'm keeping this is because the boxset is so nice. This would be a 5 star review if the other editions of the film were available. The guilty party here is greed. Take it from an unbiased customer.",1266451200,3,974,4.329670329670329
3576342,2,B001FB55H6,"Well....where do I begin?

Don't get me wrong, I liked Watchmen when it was released in theaters. I even read the comic beforehand (liked it, natch) and still enjoyed it. I mean,
you can only convey so much in a single film, right? And I think, considering certain changes by the creative team and the limitations imposed
by...whoever is responsible for the running time, the theatrical cut was pretty good. I heard some very contrasting opinions on this super-long-ass
version; some said it was the very best and some said it was the very worst, 'completely falling apart' as described by more than one person.

So then I saw it. Twice. Just to make sure.

I think I'll have to agree with those in the 'hater' camp. Ouch.

Alright, obviously the big problem with the Ultimate Cut is Tales of the Black Freighter being added to the movie. Great animated short, well acted, but
it is very poorly edited into the film. Abysmally. Pathetically. The transition effects range from being either extremely poor and almost nonexistent to
nonexistent entirely. This is incredibly jarring and completely ruins the flow of the movie, almost bringing it to a grinding halt. I really don't know
what's worse, suddenly leaping into these animated sequences and having to adjust accordingly or leaping out of them and having to adjust back to the
actual movie (which stylistically is completely different from Black Freighter). Plus, the viewer's attention to and knowledge of the plot is disrupted
so often that the movie feels overlong, endless even.

Another failure of the Ultimate Cut is the the added live-action scenes segueing (and I use that term very loosely, see above) between the Black
Freighter scenes and the movie proper, or 'the scenes with the Two Bernies'. Apparently this was supposed to provide a perspective of 'the-man-on-the-
street', the ignorant bystanders who eventually get caught up in Veidt's scheme. The acting was perfectly fine. Yet both 'Bernies' were given so little
screen-time and were so barely developed that they amounted to nothing more than glorified extras with lines. When New York was destroyed while the two
embraced, I didn't feel anything. No sense of scale of the loss of life or even a sense of loss, period. This is worsened by the previously mentioned
pacing problems, which make you wish the movie would just hurry the hell up already (sorta like me, hah hah hah).

Last but not least is the thematic importance of the Black Freighter and the parallels it draws with Veidt's ultimate plan. Whatever ambiguity that was
present in the theatrical version or the director's cut is completely lost in this version, at least in theory. Assuming now that the Black Freighter
scenes were well integrated and actually seemed relevant to the overall plot, it essentially tells us that Veidt's plan is doomed to fail. He murdered
over 15 million people, deceived many more and framed and murdered his former colleagues...all for nothing. This seems to leave a not so subtle
impression on the viewer regarding Rorschach and Veidt's final decisions: Rorschach = Somewhat Good In The End (though still a deluded, ruthless
psychopath), Veidt = Bad. Very, very, very, very, very, veeeeeeeery bad. Isn't that right, kids? Just look at how bad he is! Boooooo!
At best, it's redundant. At worst, it is unbelievably hamfisted and condescending to the viewer, like they can't draw their own opinion. The comic was
ambiguous about it, both in theory and in execution; this 'Ultimate Cut' just spoon-feeds it to you in a very misguided way.

Aside from that, the new material brought along by the director's cut is pretty damn good and makes the movie flow better and the plot more
understandable. All except for one little thing...

'Mommy, that guy in the space rocket...is he Jesus?'
'No, honey.'

That's...that's just...inexcusable. From any standpoint. It worked in the comic because it was just one small exchange in a hectic scene where a lot was
happening. It didn't slow the scene down or become its focus (hell, you didn't even see the mother and child). Here, the combination of the swelling
music and the lingering close-up of the mother and child is far too corny. Condescending. TWEE. Hell, it almost implies that the only way the audience
can feel for these people is if we get a close up of a cute and oblivious child saying something cute and oblivious! So cheap! So, so...insulting.

From what I gather, the only reason this so-called 'Ultimate Cut' exists is to ""appease the fans"". Judging by this product, it appears you can just
shoehorn in any old crap without careful consideration of how it effects the pacing or the overall movie, and these ""fans"" will just unthinkingly gobble
it up by virtue of it simply being there. ""So what if it doesn't work at all? Look! There's that thing from the comic that wasn't there before! Yay!
Other people know that it exists! Clap and honk like the trained seals that you are, fandom! Ork! Ork!"" This is a depressing trend, where people are
willing to sacrifice quality and good sense in favour of cheap pandering, and the creators of said material are increasingly willing to grant them this.",1266278400,15,5168,4.896

So then I watched it about 10 more times and found out, wow, there's a version coming out with Tales of the Black Freighter in the move. So I waited out 5 months. I watched it in one sitting.

The action is superb, espeically the first sequence with the Comedian, (Jeffery Dean Morgan), and then you're introed to Rorshach, (Jackie Earl Haley, the best actor in the whole movie.), You then get Nite Owl, (Patrick Wilson), and the other motley crew of superheroes, Dr. Manhattan, Veit, Silk Spector. The movie itself is a little hard to swallow in one sitting, I suggest breaking it up in to sets that you can bear, like working out. But on your couch, and probably with some popcorn and your eyes glued to your extremly big TV.

The packaging is interesting, having the pirate thing instead of the smiley face or the Doomsday Clock. When you open it, the cover is magnetic, then there's a pocket holding the discs in all thier glory. You get a foldable case for the movie itself, which contains the Ultimate Cut, second disc with tons of extras, and disc three, the digital copy.

I had to pepper him with questions right up until the very end.  Not a good sign.

Some other observations:

1.  The soundtrack for this blows.  No, let me try to be more articulate.  It frequently was a jarring mish-mash between the music and what was happening onscreen.  It was almost as if somebody had put their iPod on random and pushed ""play"".

2.  What's with all the slow motion these days?  Good grief.  It's getting out of hand.  At one point, the characters are crossing the street in slow motion!

3.  They should have delimited Dr. Manhattan's powers more believably.  By the time he's smooching that chick on Mars I had pretty much checked out of the movie.

4.  What?  No minorities among the Watchmen?  Unacceptable!  When is Hollywood going to learn: the only justification for casting white people is if you need a villain, an airhead, or a gender-bending misfit.",1264896000,,1189,4.5260663507109005
3576585,1,B001FB55H6,"In these apocalyptic times of the credit crisis, a movie like this invokes the very darkest side of humanity and asks us to watch what evil we posses. This sounds like a good story, but is flawed by the lack of balance - there's no uplifting elements to counteract the gloom.

This is a movie that views the world as a faceless machine - the waiter, the guard, the taxi driver are all human beings living out a robotic life where a few ""conscious"" people, the super heroes, lament about how terrible everything is. There are attempts at humour, but nothing that's genuinely funny. As a result this film comes off as depressing. The film gets close to saying life is not worth living.

One thing that hurts the story, is how much abuse people's bodies take before they die: you see people being bashed around for minutes, when one blow would have killed them. This makes the deaths seem farcical and meaningless.

I know someone who likes the film because she had an abusive ex boyfriend who she is still in love with, years later - this film helps her justify these feelings. The relationships in the film are neither moments of love, nor Ayn Rand style powerplay. They are irrational, pointless - as if sex was unimportant, and I would say, viewed cynically. There's no joy of sex here.

This is a movie that touches upon interesting topics, but most of this intelligence is in the similes and metaphors used by the characters, and as a consequence this film drops you moments of thought provoking ideas but they don't have any context in the story as a whole.

Some of the cinematography is interesting with some nicely framed shots, but the editing is mediocre which really detracts from this effort. The acting is disjoint, there's little chemistry, and it feels they did not rehearse, so the characters are not clear in the actor's minds. The writing is average.

I have no problem with the nudity, but the blue character, Dr. Manhattan, (and this is a criticism of the graphic novel as well) the blueness is abstract. The fact that he's blue is not really relevant at all.

This is a paranoid, violent movie, that you will enjoy if you are into these things. If you like to think the world is going to end, you will enjoy this movie.",1264809600,8,2239,4.56857855361596

These jerks need to read the reviews so no one else EVER makes another movie like this.  I need a superhero to bring the Watchmen writers, directors, and studio pimps to justice.

3576591,3,B001FB55H6,"To give credit where due: this movie goes beyond the simplistic formulas of the usual superhero movies, and attempts to deal with SOCIAL issues, rather than just individual ones.  For example, clearly avoiding nuclear holocaust is preferable to merely cleaning up streetgangs who happened to hurt a friend.

And it tries to get beyond the rigid dualism of GOOD vs. EVIL, by intimating that most of the times things are not so clear.  For example, Veidt is a liar and a murderer, but does it in a greater cause--which really is a greater cause, and not merely self-serving.

Also, it presents a lot of characters, and they go through changes--all of which adds interest.  Oddly, Rorschach is the most interesting, and the best actor.

However, the take on social issues, while laudable in principle, is lame in practice.  The movie is still hobbled by its ""the political is always personal"" outlook.  For example, when Veidt and Rorschach finally face off, no resolution is possible except for one of them to blow the other up.

As in all superhero movies, the special effects are more important than the people.  You don't really know if Billy Crudup is affectless because the character demands it, or if he just can't act.

All in all, this picture is unsettling and not very instructive or fun.

Phew! They also gave it a list price that would milk every last cent out of only the diehard fanboys who held out to the end or had to have it to own every version.

But will I buy this one just to see the Black Freighter cut into the film? I think the high cost after seeing the IMAX showing and buying the Blu-Ray, the Game (w/Movie) and the Black Freighter disc is the dealbreaker on this one.

I can take a bit of superjunkism. Like I thoroughly enjoyed The Incredibles. But that one was funny with likeable characters. I even liked District 9, for some reason I could relate to the personal story, however farcical the setting. But this one is ridiculous without being funny. It takes itself way too seriously to be enjoyed by adults. And there is no personal story to relate to.

Maybe it's like other reviewers have said, I had to preconceived ideas about how everything should look and I could just enjoy this, but I don't think that does this justice.

The characters are brutally human and honestly portrayed, they are complicated and endearing, and the actors playing just are them. The fighting is gruesome and usually that's not my thing but here it fits. I didn't know what would happen next, and that is a treat, it wasn't formulaic like so many others, at the end I felt satisfied, normally I'm thinking, ""so that's it...really"".

It was long, in a good way, it took as long as it needed to tell a good story! Most movies spend so much time playing catch up for the new comers you never tell a good story, not here, back-stories are revealed throughout while movie's own story develops.

As for all these naysayers, some who claim to be fans and were pissed about the squid ending being pulled and replaced with a more practical ending (the squid ending in the novel was stupid to me the 50+ times I have read it), this comic is over 20 years old. Some things had to be maneuvered (i.e. outfits, endings) to make the newer audience more receptive. You act like he changed the entire story around. Also, the acting was great and the cast was picked perfectly with respects to both looks and skill. Would you rather see Tom Cruise as Nite Owl II, or Angelina Jolie as Silk Spectre II? Didn't think so. As I have said, as a long time fanboy, I highly recommend this movie. If you have not seen this or have seen it and not read the novel, READ IT.

It's a little too jarring in the movie, I feel.  In the comic, it works perfectly, but inserting it (back) into the movie just makes it feel out of place and proves that there are some things that comic books do that movies just can't pull off as well.  That said, though, as a comic purist, I like that the ""Freighter"" story is in there now...I just felt like it made the movie drag a little--probably ESPECIALLY if you haven't read the comic.

One of the distinctive features of this version to all the other dvd releases is that this one contains all the deleted/bonus scenes in the main cut of the movie as well as the short animated ""Tales from the Black Freighter"". It views alot more like the graphic novel than the theatrical or the extended cuts. What this means is that this movie is long. I think it works greatly, however, and gives this cut a sense of completeness. I highly recommend this for the true/avid Watchmen fans, not for the casual viewer. The entire extended cut with Tales from the Black Freighter fit in a single disc, leaving the other disc to contain the special features, which is a really nice touch.

3576795,3,B001FB55H6,"I am a fan of the Watchmen movie, preferably the 'Director's Cut' version.
Because I wasn't familiar with the source material , I could watch the film without preconceptions.
I first watched it without the sound on, just reading the subtitles.
Sleeping babies can affect your movie watching capabilities. I was able to take in purely the visual aspect of it - on that basis alone, the film succeeded for me.

Hearing it with the sound on changes the emotional tone completely - it is even more dramatic. I do wonder how it would have been with hardly any music. It does not need much.

Now, after watching the Director's Cut a few more times, I've begun to make more sense of it. I realise that the film is all about people who are coming to terms with their lives and that some are not afraid to make drastically dangerous decisions, without concern for morality. For this reason, it can be a hard film to sit through. There are periods in the film (such as the trip to another planet) where two of the characters talk and one of them mentions how it is so scientifically fascinating that a person is born - the event of life creation is described in beautiful language. The scene has a great sadness and weight to it, seeming somehow timeless.

At the same time, the film has some quite violent sections. I hope this gives you an idea of how much is going on in it.

All the actors fit their roles incredibly well, the world of the movie is believable, effects work seamlessly and overall it is an offbeat and rather long movie - demanding is an accurate word.
It is very dark and explores failure as a theme, similar to 'The Dark Knight'. Perhaps part of the reason the film got made is good timing - 'The Dark Knight' was very successful and took the superhero movie somewhere else.

I recommend you rent it to see what you think of it - whether you look at the source material is up to you.
If you find yourself intrigued by the film, you will likely then need time to watch it again as you felt able to 'take it in' over several viewings, which is what worked for me.
You could call it a drama with a comic book aspect or vice versa.
I'm glad it got made and that it has caused such intense scrutiny.
I don't plan to read the source material - after all, some of us just want to see the film, not read the book.

I had read about the Director's Cut on a website and was completely happy with the Ultimate Cut. Some people seem to prefer the movie without ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" cut in, but since it's the same in the graphic novel I did like it.
I doubt I have to say much more about the movie itself: I assume that if someone didn't like it at all he/she wouldn't buy the Ultimate Cut, so of course the movie is great.
The box is full of documentaries and extra stuff, until now I haven't even seen everything but keep watching. It also includes a digital copy of the theatrical version - for those who mind to carry Watchmen around an their iPod or something.
To me, ""The Complete Motion Comics"" was a pretty interesting and wonderful feature. It's also available in Germany but lacks some quality since the German speaker doesn't really seem to grasp the comic's mood. (Besides, I haven't even read the German translation so all I know is the English one.) The original version is spoken well though and I enjoyed watching the comics (although I do prefer reading them).

The box itself looks pretty nice, with glossy pictures of our beloved (if so) heroes inside.

I think that Watchmen fans should buy this box for it's truly worth every cent. People who aren't too familiar with the graphic novel but like the theatrical version should rather have a look at the Director's Cut.

You get not only the Director's cut which is superior to the theatrical version but the Tales of the Black Freighter is also inter-weaved in the film as it is in the original graphic making it just that much better. The film also features two commentaries from Zack Snyder and Dave Gibbons.

As if that isn't enough the special features disc includes some really great mini-documentaries including the Under the Hood retrospective (with cheesy 70s commercials included) and a documentary on how truly groundbreaking the graphic novel was, not just to the comics industry but the literary and entertainment industry as whole. There are just too many special features to list, enough to easily spend hours pouring over.

The final piece to this magnificent collection is the inclusion of the motion comic. If you've ever listened to the graphic novel vs. film debate but can't bring yourself to read the graphic novel this is a great way to make your own decision.

The packaging is excellent as well. Could they have included some more gadgets and literature with it like other special editions? Sure, but it doesn't spoil what is in the box. The Blu-Ray version is so beautiful visually and audibly. If you have only had the chance to see this in standard definition you truly haven't seen this film. For all the criticism regarding the writing Mr. Snyder has done an excellent job putting together a visual masterpiece.

The only negative to this set would be the lack of inclusion of the alternate ending which has been confirmed as being filmed. As a fan of the graphic novel I would like to see the original ending as Moore had written but I do feel the new ending is much more believable and lends itself well to the story. With the inclusion of the motion comic you can view for yourself and draw your own conclusions.

That is the only flaw (and a very minor one) that I can see with this package. I would highly recommend this as a must have for any film aficionado.",1261699200,,2052,4.657458563535911

Hopefully this massacre of an adaptation won't frighten viewers from investing in the graphic novel, which is infinitely more intelligent and rewarding. The problem isn't just the script - which is bland, misogynist, overtly violent and dimwitted - it's the direction. Let's face it: Zack Snyder shouldn't be making movies, he should be making screen-savers. It's over-stylized nonsense, and it detracts from the maturity of the content.

So, in short, by turning Laurie into a self-centered bimbo, adding heaps of unnecessary violence, often hilarious dialog, and a side-splittingly out of place soundtrack, Zack Snyder has managed to turn an intelligent comic book (which is something of a rarity these days) into a moronic popcorn flick which has sold tens of thousands of chain-wallets and wristbands and beanies (which is tragically commonplace). Somehow, this disaster turned into a hit with a strange and decidedly 16-year-old fanbase. Well, you guys can have my copy - I think I'd rather just read it.

Zack, your attempts at sabotaging things that I think are cool have not gone unnoticed. I've got my eye on you, bub, and if you lay one finger on The Dark Knight Returns, well so-help-me-God I will write you the angriest of emails. And don't you forget it.",1261267200,5,1324,5.041095890410959

Even though I'm not a big movie fan, I decided to get this movie for my Blu-Ray player which has been rather collecting dust over the past couple of months.

The movie looks great, sharp, full of vibrant colors and no blurriness.

The movie can get boring at times, I was hoping this would be as entertainment as Sin City, but it really isn't.  The acting isn't great either, Jackie Earle Haley who plays Rorschach is probably the best of the bunch and an excellent actor in my opinion, but the rest of the actors are really bland. Carla Gugino being a great actress is only seen for about 10 minutes (give or take) of the entire movie and not given a major role. I think she would've made a great Sally Jupiter II instead of Malin Akerman.

3577004,5,B001FB55H6,"As this full version of Watchmen is well over 3 hours long it is understandable that commercial constraints required a theatrical cut for uninitiated moviegoers (just imagine the bafflement of those expecting something a bit like X-Men!), but it was cynical and insulting to fans for the studio to release a so-called ""Director's Cut"" that is still an incomplete version relative to this ""Ultimate Cut"". Can we now safely assume that this is where the buck finally stops and there isn't a ""Lighting Up Double Chuck Norris With Cheese Cut"" in the pipeline?

I've been waiting for this Ultimate Cut since before the movie was in the cinema, and have not watched the Watchmen in any other version, as having read the comic I wanted to see Snyder's full uncompromised movie interpretation.

Was it worth the wait? Well, as I've not seen the shorter versions I can't say how it compares with them as a viewing experience; but standing alone it is very impressive - a true labour of love bringing virtually every page of the comic, including the prose, to the screen. A film of considerable length and girth - be prepared to use the pause button or double-cross your legs to make it all the way through in one sitting. Tales of the Black Freighter, spliced into the film in this edition, is just fantastic, and the problem of how to handle Under The Hood is solved brilliantly as an extra feature on disc 2 in the style of an 80's tv chat show, complete with commercial breaks. Like the comic, there is amazing detail in the props & backgrounds that will reward revisiting, for example the airships that hang like bombs over New York (and now edge inexoroably closer towards the World Trade Centre like 9/11 in slow motion).

If this had been the first time an Alan Moore comic had been made into a film I wonder if he would have a much higher opinion of Hollywood than he does now as a result of the defilement of some of his other works (although I must say I liked V for Vendetta even if he hated it). So, as anyone interested in this Ultimate Cut probably already knows, Ozymandias's plan is different in final detail to the comic, but its purpose and effect is the same; and in my judgement over-all there are more parts of the film that are absolutely faithful to the comic than there are parts that deviate from it. And, dare I say there was at least one deviation that I consider an improvement over the comic - the scene where Rorschach recounts the incident with the child killer - as the comic's version always struck me as a blatent rip-off of the demise of the Toe-Cutter in Mad Max.

I would give 4.5 rather than 5 stars because I am reviewing the product as well as the film, and in an Ultimate Edition I would have hoped for a menu on disc 1 where I can choose to watch any of the 3 cuts of the film or just the complete Black Freighter on its own, all in HD, as the content is all there on one disc and it is surely just a matter of the order in which the player strings it together. Instead we just get a low definition ""digital copy"" of the theatrical cut on a seperate disc. While this should save the inconvenience of having to rip and recode the movie in order to watch it on a low resolution portable device why cant we watch the full-length version we paid extra for? Battery life?

To anyone in the UK thinking of importing this version which is currently unavailable in our green and pleasant land: The Bluray plays happily on a standard unmodified UK PAL Playstation 3, and presumably any other UK player. BUT unfortunately Amazon.com will write the price of the product on the outside of the parcel, which means the Royal Mail will hold the parcel at your local depot until you turn up to pay import duty, and additionally a Royal Mail administration charge which is in excess of the import duty (and they have the audacity to go on strike for more money!). Amazon are not liable for any of that and there is no facility to pay it up-front, so you are looking at an inconvenient trip to the depot and quite a bit extra to pay over the apparent checkout price; but it is still a lot cheaper than buying the UK versions of the director's cut and the theatrical cut and tales of the black freighter and the motion comic seperately, which is all essentially included in the Ultimate Cut along with even more content.",1260662400,3,4334,4.439698492462312

3577007,5,B001FB55H6,"I'm not a graphic novel fan, much less did I ever see ""Watchmen"" in graphic novel form. However, near the end of this movie it came together in a way that made me think, exceptionally so. This despite some scenes I fast-forwarded thru, and others I wish I had.

To try to synopsize my impressions, the movie presents its characters as ""familiar foreigners"", i.e. people who may inform us about ourselves because they are at once so different, yet so similar to ourselves. If I said which character works best for me, I would be giving away much of the plot. Let me just say  ""Watchmen"" takes even the most derivative technical effects, and offsets them with characters unique to me. These people are struggling. If you've ever felt suffocated by weeds, rightly or wrongly, you may relate to these characters. Its like that for them.

You'll see a lot of comments on Amazon about ""The Black Freighter."" This didn't work for me, except its animated beginning, and its ending live-action seque. That live-action segue was some of the heaviest for me, and I'm not totally sure why. See what I mean? Nonetheless, the ""Watchmen"" soundtrack works very, very well for me, enough to push my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars.

Bottom line for me is, a rough watch, but ""Watchmen"" is worth the effort. Everyone involved in making it, helped make it so. I think a lot of work went into this movie, beginning with the makers learning to understand and convey its harsh eloquence.

3577060,3,B001FB55H6,"So I hadn't read the comic prior to the movie coming out.  I know several people who did and they'd always spoken very highly of it.  Once I heard that it was coming to theaters, I decided against it so as not to sway my opinion of the movie -- I didn't want it suffer the ""not as good as the book"" and ""they left this and this and this out"" sort of deal.  So I saw the movie in the theaters, and I freaking loved it.  Best movie of the year until District 9 and then Zombieland in my opinion.  Just phenomenal film, very interesting, excellent cinematagraphy, sfx, great characters, gritty and dark feel -- just an all around great movie that went well above my expectations.

I was pumped when it was to be released on blu-ray Director's Cut, but I heard that they'd be releasing the ""Ultimate Edition"" near year's end so I figured I'd wait and see what we ended up with.  I later heard it was going to push 200+ minutes of total video into the film and I was ecstatic and so I waited all this time.

I pre-ordered the Ultimate Edition and it arrived promptly (rock on Amazon) and couldn't wait to throw it in and watch it in glorious 1080p.  Well, after watching the full monstrosity that it is, I can safely say it sort of ruined the whole of the movie for me.  Very little of this 3+ hour behemoth added anything to the value of the Watchmen experience, and it moreso detracted from it.

The ""Tales of the Black Freighter"", which I hadn't seen prior to the Ultimate Edition, is by far one of the lamest things I've ever seen.  The best part about it was the narration, as Gerard Butler lent his voice to at least make it something you could turn the TV off and listen to if you really need.  The whole of the video was just gross for the sake of being gross 98% of the time you're watching anything on screen.  If it would've been cgi rather than animated, people would be throwing up watching it -- seriously, it's really THAT bad.  I'm sorry, but it's just overly gross and graphic (this coming from a fan of Rikki-Oh, Starship Troopers, and the theatrical Watchmen) and adds ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to the live-action Watchmen experience, especially when one minute you're in the Watchmen world and the next you're watching CGI waves and shoddy, low-budget animation.  I really have to wonder what Snyder was thinking when he signed off on it.  Also, the way it was shoved into the movie just didn't work.  You can tell they really did make an effort to transition back and forth, but it ended up forcing dumb extra scenes to make it happen and they all just really, REALLY detract from the overall experience.  This portion of the movie alone gives me buyer's remorse, bleh.

I'm usually a big fan of deleted scenes in movies; I love to get that extra bit of info, etc., but unfortunately, all of the scenes that were removed from the theatrical version to make it more coherent, valid, and interesting, really have no business being in the movie at all.  They just make the flow of the movie grind to a halt (save for the scene with Spectre escaping, imo) and I really can't disagree with Snyder/the producers for having removed them from the theatrical version in the first place.

Other features:  I'm sure they're all great, but after sitting down and watching 3+ hours of a movie I'm not happy with, the last thing I want to do is watch the extras.

Overall verdict:  If you like Watchmen, and really liked the Director's Cut and the ""tales"" then you'll probably love this.  If you're one of those people, however, you should probably seek some sort of help.",1260230400,4,3567,4.432515337423313

I just loved this movie. Bear in mind that I usually do not like movies like Transformers, 2012, the Michael Bay ones, Con Air, Mission Impossible (the second part is the worst of all) stuff like that. Also, I also go for comic adaptations with suspicious. But, after ""IRON MAN"", I thought they could really work.

I was  in the middle of part five of the graphic novel (yes, that's a sin, never read it before), when I watched the movie. I don't know if it was the good mood I was in the day, whatever, but the movie got me by the opening sequence and I never got bored or disappointed. I just loved it, every single bit of it (and, like it semms to be the case with many fans, Roscharch was my favorite character.

First, up until I had read the novel, I thought it was a faithful adaptation. Second, the cinematography was spectacular. Casting and costume design were on the spot, it was like the comics were alive. And, thankfuly, the editing was great. You could see the fights, see what's happening, instead of these modern lightning-cut editing tha people seem to enjoy today.

The adpaptation was clearly handled with care and affection by people involved; However, I can understand some negative points mentioned by some reviewers. We must remember director Snyder was behind cameras in DAWN OF THE DEAD and 300 (which I did not like at all). So, he clearly enjoys some gore. But, overall, given the lenght of the movie and the potential scenes to use graphical gore, he kept his instincts at bay... He only goes for it with full throttle in the scene when Roscharch kills the raper. Also, thre is Dr. Manhattan pulverizing Vietnamese people, The Comedian killing a pregnant woman,the overall annihilation of a number of cities around the world. But these last ones are done without so much graphic description. And, remember: the scenes (or at least the idea) ARE in the comics!

Like I said, I loved this movie.",1260057600,2,1939,4.622093023255814
3577064,5,B001FB55H6,"I am a huge fan of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons's astonishing masterpiece and had been really upset about learning that the comic to end all comics was being made into a movie.  I had hoped that if it was going to be made at all, it would be as the miniseries that Terry Gilliam has briefly hoped to make.  But a two or three hour movie?  How could that take place without becoming a travesty?  Then I heard and read all the reviews when the film came out.  The film was passionately hated by huge numbers of fans of the book.  So I decided to avoid the film.  Almost as an afterthought, however, I put the Blu-ray on my Netflix queue.  Even after it reached the top of my queue and arrived in my mailbox, for several days I avoided watching it.  But when I finally put it on to watch, I was pleasantly -- indeed, very pleasantly -- surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  Was it as good as the book?  An absurd question.  Of course not.  Was it a truly great movie?  No.  But by the standards of today's big budget movies, which are as a rule pretty mediocre affairs, I thought WATCHMEN a very good movie indeed.  I think most of the people hating it do so out of a misguided devotion to the book, to an unconscious and mistaken idea that to enjoy the film would somehow be an act of infidelity to the original.  I enjoyed the film.  I might even put it on the list of the ten best superhero movies I've ever seen.  It may not be a masterpiece like the book, but that doesn't mean that it isn't a good film in its own right.

The film begins spectacularly and thereafter slows down a bit, even dragging a bit at the end.  But overall the film does a nice job of translating a book into film, despite the conviction that the book was unfilmmable.  I had heard the standard critiques of the film, that it left too much of the book out, that too much of it was merely a frame by frame recreation of the book, but while I knew that some parts were missing (I did get a kick out of seeing the kid reading THE TALE OF THE BLACK FREIGHTER by the newsstand), but I personally didn't feel that the missing parts lessened the narrative laid out before us.  I loved the look of the film, though it had a great soundtrack (I especially loved the use of bits from Philip Glass's SATYAGRAHA during the Dr. Manhattan back story) and liked that they used Leonard Cohen's version of ""Hallelujah"" during Nite Owl and Silk Spectre's love scene when most films and TV shows use cover versions).  And I especially enjoyed the cast.  Jackie Earle Haley was extraordinary as the sociopath Rorschach, Patrick Wilson as the un-masculine Nite Owl, and Malin Akerman as Silk Spectre.  There were a couple of misses.  Matthew Goode was pretty flat as Adrian Veidt / Ozymandias and Billy Crudup was wasted as Dr. Manhattan, a role that required as little human emotion as possible.  I was once again amazed by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who is one of the most remarkable actors around, a complete chameleon who can play, apparently, any kind of role.  In an age where most leading actors tend to play the same kind of role over and over, Morgan has no type.  I love actors who can continually surprise you with what they are capable of.  He is very fine here as the misanthropic and violent Comedian, the first of the former ""masks"" to die.

There are many who simply will not allow themselves to do anything but hate and detest this movie.  But being objective, I think it was a lot of fun and a very decent movie.  Perhaps those who, like me, are huge fans of the book and have been putting off seeing the film because of the bad press are perhaps the group of people who are most likely to enjoy the film  I frankly enjoyed this so much that I now plan on buying it.

On a sidenote, if you are, like me, a fan of the TV shows filmed in Vancouver, it is pretty easy to recognize this as a British Columbia product.  Once you see people like Allesandro Juliani, Jerry Wasserman, Robert Wisden, Don Thompson, Fulvio Cecere, and Rob LaBelle (all of whom, for example, appeared in BATTLESTAR GALACTICA), you know you are watching a Vancouver production.  You almost never see any of these actors in Hollywood productions.  But they all show up in shows like THE X-FILES, SMALLVILLE, DARK ANGEL, the STARGATEs, and EUREKA.  It is like watching a ensemble theater troupe act out their plays.",1260057600,5,4349,4.3606965174129355

Znyder took a brave step when he decided to change an essential part of the movie. Luckily, that change manages to make more sense even compared to the original book. The Tales of the Black Freighter is also very well done and has been expanded a little. Watchmen obviously mops the floor with 300, and Znyder proved to be exactly the right man for this movie.

3577068,5,B001FB55H6,"I could start out with the line from Dave Mason's classic song:  ""There are no good guys, there are no bad guys, there's only you and me and we just disagree.""

Most superhero movies deal with people who are basically moral and upright, where the villains are usually evil, and where the focus is on PG-13 rated action.  This movie blurs the distinction between good and evil, where the heroes are no less violent (and in some cases no less murderous) than the villains.  The result in fairly nihlistic, that there is really no meaning to everything.  In another sense, it is existential, where we create our own meaning.

I am giving this five stars.  Why?  Because it is a well crafted story.  It gives you opportunity to know the characters psychologically rather than the typical two dimensional stereotypes where the emphasis is on the action instead of on the person.  (The recent Batman series comes closest to this, with honorable mention to the X-Men Trilogy.)  It is a long movie, but that's because it doesn't rush the story.

There were many reasons I could have given it a lower rating.  Some are purely subjective, such as the dark and bleak outlook of the movie.  Some are due to feeling this being an R-Rated movie with a lot of vile language, too graphic violence, and going all out on the nude scene with Night Owl II and Silk Spectre II-- a lot of that seeming gratituous.

This is, as just said, an R-Rated movie.  Teenagers don't need to see this movie.  Personally, I think they don't need to be exposed to that hopeless a philosophy any more than to the sex and violence.  In other words, I long for the days of the Batman TV series.  But maybe Silk Spectre I was right -- the future looks darker and the past looks brighter.  I just would like to do more to brighten the future.",1259452800,,1802,4.503086419753086

3577151,5,B001FB55H6,"I went to see The Watchmen this weekend because it was about the only new thing to see. It is a movie adaptation of a seminal work that has been purported to have raised the genre of the mere comic book to that of the graphic novel. It turned out to be a rather enjoyable film in spite of its gruesome aspects.

The Watchmen takes place in an alternate universe in 1985 with Richard Nixon now serving his fifth term as president. Do we detect some major liberal angst generated by the Reagan years? The background is the ever present threat of a U.S.-Soviet nuclear war. However, the U.S. has a deterrent more powerful that a MX missile with 10 Mk-21 warheads: We have Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup)! The Doctor is a blue fuzzy apparition of a physicist who was transformed into super-being by an experiment gone wild.

The background story attempts to show a world in which superheroes exit. The Watchmen have been around since 1940 fighting crime and doing a few other things too. The U.S. wins the Vietnam War after Nixon persuades the Watchmen to intervene as one notable example. I guess this is how he was able to get the 22 Amendment repealed and be elected for another three terms? Naturally, Henry Kissinger is still at his side.

The action starts with the murder of The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), one of the more notorious Watchmen. Now who was that on the ""grassy knoll"" in the Kennedy assassination scene anyway? Rorschach (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) immediately suspects that someone is out to kill off the Watchmen and that The Comedian is just the first. As we follow his effort to warn the others, we meet the rest of the team: The Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), Oyzmandias (Matthew Goode), Dr. Manhattan, and his girlfriend Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman). The government, i.e. Nixon, has banned masked crime fighters like the Watchmen. But, it still relies on Dr. Manhattan to keep us safe from the Soviet nuclear threat. Then he doesn't wear a mask and in fact usually doesn't wear clothes either!

Rorschach has one of the strangest superhero masks ever. It is a continually changing ""ink blot"" pattern, hence his name. If you would guess from this that he is a crazy [characterization deleted] then you'd be correct! He repeatedly flies into fits of psychotic rage killing those (mostly villains) he thinks deserve it. He has a complete disdain for what he calls ""liberal sensitivities"".

Oyzmandias has the super skill of being the smartest man in the world. He has reasoned that the primary risk of war is the struggle over energy resources. Therefore, he has set out to develop a limitless source of energy. Silk Spectre II aka Laurie Jupiter meanwhile finds it impossible to like up her mothers, Silk Spectre aka Sally Jupiter's (Carla Gugino), reputation.

The action takes a major turn when Dr. Manhattan's girlfriend, Silk Spectre II, breaks up with him and develops a relationship with Nite Owl II. The jilted Dr. Manhattan loses his sense of purpose and leaves for Mars to wallow in self-pity. This of course causes a radical shift in the U.S.-Soviet strategic balance. Before long Nixon and Kissinger are planning a preemptive attack on the Soviets as they fear the Soviet are planning an attack on the U.S.

This film is a fun political nostalgia trip and a great satire of the whole superhero concept. Such treats as snippets of the McLaughlin Group debating the impact of Dr. Manhattan on the strategic balance as just one example. If one can get past the graphic violence and some sexuality, Watchmen provides a lot of laughs for those familiar with the reference points or the original work. It is definitely not for children.",1259107200,4,3659,4.770932069510269

Snyders adaptation of one of the most legendary is remarkably true to the text until THE END! At one of the greatest moments in comic book history his film-that was so true to a book that most of us who love it were willing to forgive dry acting and flat delivery of Allan Moores lines- completely CHANGED the end, blasted out one of the best points to ever be made in a comic series by making Dr Manhattan the cause of the earths cities destruction!!! Its no wonder Allan Moore didn't want his name attached to this project. There are so many things wrong with this change and so many questions it raises, especially since Americas enemies believed Dr Manhattan an American trick- there by negating the whole united front perspective. Ugh it was like eating the greatest meal of your life and then finding a cockroach in the last bite. If anything it will hopefully show Hollywood, as Iron Man 1 has, that the CLOSER u make these films to the books, the better they are. Good movie but the ultimate insult to real hardcore fans.

3577159,5,B001FB55H6,"This is a Thank you to Snyder, WB for releasing the definitive, uncut movie of Watchmen. Yes, granted we got the Director's cut back in July, but this is the icing on the cake, the happy ending, winning TD, the creme de la creme of Director Cut movies. Even though we have to shell out some $$, Yaaaaahhh Capitalism.

The movie is nicely packaged and comes with the complete animated motion comic DVD. Now most will say why get this? Why drop like 30 something bucks? In a economy crisis we're in? Why just get the director's cut, the Tales of the Black Freighter, separately? I think this Cut with the Tales of the Black freighter, interwoven in gives the story more depth, more ""meat"" to this movie, as in the comic itself there is so much that is going on, so much layering in story, characters, you just do not get that if you buy TOBF and Watchmen Regular Director's Cut, doesn't feel whole... as this, with the Ultimate Cut, it feels whole even though longer but feels totally in sync with the graphic novel itself. I have not yet watched it with Commentary with Snyder and co writer Dave Gibbons which I think will be very interesting, get an intimate insight from one of today's most visionary directors.

Over all very pleased with this edition, nearly flawless, as great as Dark Knight Blu Ray I have to say.",1258588800,2,1318,4.4875

3577201,4,B001FB55H6,"First, kudos to Snyder and WB for announcing before the earlier DVD release of Watchmen that an Ultimate Cut would be released, providing a date, and following up on it.  Anybody that did the research wasn't hurt by a second release of this film.

Onto the product itself: this version of the film is incredibly faithful to the book, and both my girlfriend and I found we preferred it to the Theatrical.  The added material from the director's cut and Tales from the Black Freighter both add to the layers of the film.  What made the original comic book so epic was the multiple layers that the story worked on, and the ultimate cut really showcases as much.  The special features are also great, however that's also where this set is less than perfect.

Including the complete motion comic is a wonderful addition.  However, the digital copy with expiration date is fairly useless, and I would have much rather had a disc that allowed the viewer to select either the theatrical version or the director's cut.  My only other gripe is that ""Under the Hood,"" which is included and is a wonderful addition, leaves out some of the best material from the original book and could have been included.  I realize the filmmakers couldn't include everything from the book, but the suicide at the auto-garage with the music playing in the background would have been wonderful to include.",1258416000,9,1376,4.7478991596638656
3577202,5,B001FB55H6,"""Who watches the watchmen"" is one of the most memorable lines smeared across the buildings and lips of citizens in the graphic novel Watchmen. The graphic novel that went far beyond its time thanks to writer Alan Moore, it has since been turned into a popular movie phenomenon by director Zack Snyder, who managed to capture the pure essence of the novel straight to the core, leaving out what some believe are important components in the novel,  yet still maintaining the overall message. Watchmen presents the story of a group of masked heroes who live in an era where the world is on the brink of nuclear war.  The six masked heroes Dr. Manhattan, Nite Owl, Rorschach,The Comedian, Silk Spectre  and Ozymandias each represent the six ways to view the world in the radical time period it is set in. What ties this movie into a cultural phenomenon is the way in which it presents the solution and struggles of the Cold War era. The line ""who watches the watchmen""  is a sort of an irony that can be seen at the end of the movie. The masked hero, also portrayed as the smartest man in the world, Ozmandias, plans to save the human race, and unite the nations against a common enemy, by faking an alien invasion that ultimately killed half of the population in NY, yet no one knows of this secret conspiracy. Although this ending was cut from the film, and substituted with a giant explosion,  it still presented the same message, that chaos that endangers the lives of friend and enemy alike, will result in union against this common enemy.
 Although many skeptical fans believed that Snyder would not be able to capture the comic book in all of its glory, the outcome however begged to differ. Watchmen came out as an incredible watching experience, full of violence, drama, love and conspiracy. Each characters development is brought into focus on camera, what they discover about themselves and the world around them makes for an explosive emotional movie that captures young and old audiences alike.",1258329600,2,2003,4.741379310344827
3577203,5,B001FB55H6,"i won't bore anyone with the specifics, the first two or so reviewers summarized everything you get perfectly. i would just like to echo how nice this collection is, the box is awesome (although mine did come a bit beat up since they shipped it in an envelope instead of a box). everything about this set screams quality.

i would also like to shake my head at all the re+ards that gave this 1 star because the price fluctuated...

Edit 11/19/09:
Zack Snyder has mentioned many times even before the original dvd/bluray came out that there will be a 'complete collection' out in time for the holidays. this was never hidden and this is not a 'double-dip' by any means.

the nice big box includes the motion comic (originally sold separately) in its own original blu ray case and a 2BR/1DVD beautiful fold out box with the new cut of the movie (the Director's cut with the pirate story inter-weaved just like in the comic), an extras BR (includes under the hood and more) and a DVD containing the Digital Download (which by the way expires December 2010).

basically the set brings together 3 separate releases (the Director's cut BR, Black Freighter BR, and Motion Comic BR) and some extras. it is also however missing the commentary from the first Director's cut release but includes 2 new ones.

i stand by that this is the best release of the movie, and a no brainer for true fans of the graphic novel. however i believe to get the super duper uber ultimate set you would need to also buy either the Director's Cut or the PS3 game edition as well.",1258329600,6,1550,4.541218637992832
3577204,2,B001FB55H6,"when i first saw this movie i enjoyed it, there were a few things i didn't like. but overall it was fun. the change up of the ending was even understandable as a sign of changing times.

but upon watching it again i realized that while this movie here is not terrible, they changed enough key scenes of this where the spirit of ""watchmen"" is just not here. by showing the fight where the comedian gets killed they more or less give away the bad guy in the opening scene and thats one of the biggest mysteries of the book. the actor playing ozzymandus wasn't so much poorly chosen as poorly directed. ozzymandus is suposed to be unasuming and tame making the final reveal beyond shocking. but the way this guy plays it he might as well be stroking a curly mustache everytime you see him. it just screams bad guy. it's wrong.

rorchact overall is well done in this movie but they changed some things about his ""birth"" story that while they made it more visceral and apealing for a movie, changed the tone of the scene in a bad way.

the fight scenes are a little bit crap, part of the genius of watchmen is that no one has super powers, but the fight scenes seem to suggest they have super strength or speed in some way. zack snyder is an excelent director but he's more geared towards action movie style. and watchmen is not an action plot, it's a story epic. infact alot if not all the fight scenes could've been taken out of this movie.

the change to the ending is particularly crappy. i understand the motivation to it and it's not so much a bad ending in itself. but the original ending was designed to band humanity together for survival's sake, america and russia join forces against a bigger threat. but the ending in the movie is more like a religous message. ""be nice to each other kids or dr. manhatten will come down and blow you up."" which is totally crap. or at the very least not on topic at all.

this movie by itself is entertaining enough, but it's not good, just fun, and for what is one of the best stories ever written, this is a poor representation.",1258329600,11,2070,4.352331606217617

Seriously.  I read reviews about this movie going from long and boring to even longer and more boring.  One ""person"" even wrote about how Watchmen ruined the idea of superheroes they grew up with as kids.  Are they really this stupid?

The answer is yes.  Never buy a movie you know nothing about.  And Watchmen really is not for everyone.  I saw it as a pretty accurate interpretation of the superhero mythology in a world much closer to our own.

I read the graphic novel and loved it.  I am a comic book fan.  This movie did disappoint my friends, but not me, and it disappointed them because they also read the comic and wanted a closer interpretation.

Snyder did change some things and added his own creative spin and interpretation.  All directors do this.

3577209,5,B001FB55H6,"I had never heard of the Watchmen before seeing the movie, so I have no preconceptions on that front. I did read comic books as a kid.

One warning prospective viewers should be aware of: there is intense graphic violence in this movie, along with some male frontal nudity. This is NOT your standard superhero movie suitable for children, this is a movie for adults.

I loved this movie. For me it is completely unique, I can't even compare it to any other movie I've seen. A unique style, a unique story, I found it confusing but fascinating to watch. It sticks in your head. I'm going to have to watch it again just so I can pick up a more of what I missed the first time around. I guess for a general description of the movie it is a highly stylized, morally ambivalent version of the ""what if super heroes were real?"" premise, mixed with some retro and detective storytelling. But that doesn't do it justice - this is a fantastic movie experience. It's funny, dramatic, violent, and it has all kinds of intrigue and fascinating characters.

Frankly, the lead (Rorshack) should have been nominated for an oscar. He was great. Best Line Ever comes when he is sent to prison and must deal with all the people he sent there who want their revenge and think they have him right where they want him: ""You don't understand... I'm not locked in here with YOU... you're locked in here with ME.""

3577220,5,B001FB55H6,"I have already written a review on the original release of `Watchmen' on DVD. However, for you first time readers I have posted the original review of the movie along with my review of the Ultimate collection.

The comic book has now officially become the mainstream in the world of film. The major companies try to get their hands on every franchise they possibly can. The real question is once there is a movie in play how will translate to the big screen and who is the fan base? Well, we all have seen what `The Dark Knight' and `Spider-Man' have done. Still, what about the no so main stream novels such as `300'? There are directors out there that don't want to make a movie in their own vision, but yet they wish to bring the book to the screen word for word, page for page. That is the film 'Watchmen'.

'Watchmen' may be the biggest cult fan based comic book of all time. Written in an alternate reality in the 1980s, the Cold War is very much alive and all of Earth is extremely concerned about nuclear war. The heroes in this world are not ones special abilities or powers, and they are not liked by the people. Though, the costumed crusaders prevail to keep the people in line and keep order in the world. Suddenly one of them is brutally murdered and they are now the ones who fear extinction.

I made it my business to make sure I read the graphic novel before I went to see this film and it was a wise choice. This movie no doubt tried to remain as faithful to the comic as possible. The dialogue was melancholy, they characters were well cast and while there were not as many effects as a major comic book blockbuster it was still put together in a very artsy package. Though, this movie is truly not for the mainstream movie goers. Watchmen was definitely created with the true comic book fan in mind. The director Zack Snyder like on his previous work with `300' wanted to make a movie that was just as authentic as the pages it was first concocted upon. Those who read this story would definitely enjoy it even though it is a very slow movie dragged out story. There are a few major things that are changed for cinematic purposes, but after reading this story I believe that the changes made really made the story more believable and less confusing. The changing of the costumes was a positive thing because some of those characters really looked like pimped out hood ornaments in print. The actors chosen were not well known which a great thing is always. They each filled their roles perfectly and it really made me feel like the comic book was actually coming to life before my eyes. I believe that if you read the book definitely pick the movie up. If you are an innovative person who wants to see something different then you might enjoy it as well. But, I think if you are looking for the typical action super-hero flick let this one pass you by, you might not understand it. Alan Moore may have officially removed himself from any film that his work was to become, but I believe he needs to see this one, because it really has done him justice. Watchmen came out at the right time because Zack Snyder got it right.

Apparently I was not on target when I originally wrote my review, because now we have a 5 DVD Watchmen extravaganza. I have to say for one movie on its' own I have never seen such a package. This edition has everything that was made in honor of this film even dating before the movie itself was officially released in theaters! Before the movie came out where two animated films made for DVD release. The animated creation of `Tales of The Black Freighter', which is an essential piece to the Watchmen story. The special feature on that DVD included `Tales From Under the Hood'. In the graphic novel itself you see excerpts of that book and for DVD it is reinvented to be a television documentary complete with effects that make it look aged and its own advertisements. The other DVD release was `Watchmen: The Complete Motion Comic'. This was the graphic novel page for page narrated like a book on tape making the original comic book art look as if it was jumping right off the page. Thanks to this new Ultimate collectors edition these two projects are woven in to the film to make it more true to the novel and really give this film the honor and respect it deserves. Other features include the official video journals and incredible documentaries and commentary not to mention a digital copy of the original theatrical release. How can you possibly pass up purchasing this amazing DVD package? This package has it all...I am serious there is nothing missing from this film now! If you loved this movie you are going to love it even more when you officially have the complete story.",1258070400,18,4728,4.475086906141367

No giant squid and the outcome carries so much more impact. Not that the comic was bad, it was an incredible diversion from the usual, but in a day and age where everyone ups the antie, kicks things up a notch, this movie accomplished just that.

3577222,3,B001FB55H6,"I bought the first BluRay version of it, and at Best Buy the first week if you bought the movie, you got Tales of the Black Freighter for $5 more. I think that having the animation takes away from the film itself, and is better as a separate disk. If Black Freighter were live action, it would be a different story.

I get that it is coming out of a comic book and its ok that its animated, but it kinda slowes the film down. If you are super die hard fan and want the film to be EXACTLY like the graphic novel, which incorporates Black Freighter throughout, buy this version. If you're like me who likes the film as presented in the original Bluray version, with the extra footage, and feels like an animated side story would take away from the main story, making it a longer film, and would make it feel like its lagging, stick with the original. (When I got the Black Freighter I was lucky to get the Bluray version. The ad in the paper didn't specify bluray or reg dvd, so they sold me the Bluray version for 5 bucks. Regular price was $35!!! More than the actual movie, which was $24 at the time. $35 for a 25 minute animated short??? Come on, now! I lucked out i guess.)

In my opinion, Black Freighter should been included in the original bluray release instead of separate. You can see BF in its entirety, without interruption of the main film, which i thought was better. But this whole scam about selling separately then together really sucks. I wouldn't have BF if it weren't $5 bucks. If anything, rent it!",1257984000,7,1518,4.341549295774648

While I thought some of the acting was a little coldly played. I almost think a lot of it was meant to be. Also in these big action films the reviews will be split down the middle as far as who thought it was a good version of the book. Like in the Star Wars films, some of the actors are considered to be GOOD actors, yet it lost something in the writing/filming.

In my opinion, I thought the film was a great version of the book staying true (for the most part) to the book, even mirroring alot of the panels and pictures.

While I haven't recieved this 4 disc edition in the mail yet, I already knew what to expect after seeing the Director's Cut and Tales Of The Black Freighter. Considering that this is just the Director's Cut with Tales... added into the film like the book.

3577226,5,B001FB55H6,"This is one of those films that -- if you read and re-read the book as so many have -- you look forward to with both anticipation and a bit of dread. Because they could so easily have screwed this up. But I'm pleased, and a little surprised, to find that the film follows the book pretty closely -- in all the important ways. Because the book isn't really about superhero crimefighters. It's about people, both good and bad, and how they fit together. And the film pulls it off very well. The character of the uncompromisingly absolutist Rorschach, the most interesting character in both the book and the film, is very nicely rendered. Even Dr. Manhattan, the least ""human"" character, is portrayed in multiple dimensions. I think they made a good decision in not giving any of the roles to a headlining actor. No Nicholas Cage, no Gwyneth Paltrow to steal the scenes. You can pay attention to the roles the actors are playing, not the actors themselves. And, yeah, there's a lot of gore in this film, . . . but that's a human thing, too. Even the fight scenes are more explicit than you would expect (this is definitely not a kids' film), but that's to make a point. Because there's also a morality tale here about how things can so easily go wrong with society. The world is facing nuclear annihilation and it's largely because the forces of violently coercive conservatism are in control -- typified by the Comedian, who kills women and children without batting an eye, and by the fact that Richard Nixon is in his fifth term as president. Even Dan Dreibeg and Laurie Jupiter, the putative Good Guys, are out there on the right wing somewhere, trying to make the world their version of a ""better place."" This take on the 1980s is not the Good Old Days that might have been. And, of course, there's the overarching question: Is it right to do great evil in the successful pursuit of even greater good? The film actually seems much more explicit than the book about the ""alternate universe"" aspect of the story, right from the outset in the credits -- which do a very nice job of summarizing the back-story, incidentally. But let's face it, a lot of people went to see this flick for the special effects, and those are great -- and without getting in the way of the live action, which is quite an accomplishment. Especially everything surrounding Dr. Manhattan. There are lots of great quotable lines, most of them directly from the book. My favorite: ""None of you seem to understand. I'm not locked in here with you. You're locked in here with me."" The choice of `80s songs for the soundtrack also is very interesting; most of them fit the atmosphere of the story, even the actual plotline. (Except for ""99 Luft Balloons"": What in the world is that doing in there?) All in all, an excellent screen version of an excellent book.

For those who haven't read the graphic novel, the story is amazing, the action is reverting, the acting by unknown actors is great, the visual effects are stunning, and the music is beautiful.

Then came director Zach Snyder (fresh off just adapting Frank Miller's graphic novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300-The-Complete-Experience-Blu-ray-Book-Digital-Copy-and-BD-Live-Blu-ray/dp/B001LF2WCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300: The Complete Experience (Blu-ray Book + Digital Copy and BD-Live) [Blu-ray</a>]), and all fell into place. Now, the movie is out and I can't rave enough about it!

A quick synopsis of the story, by legendary writer Alan Moore and artist
Dave Gibbons, is that, in an alternate 1985 where Richard M. Nixon is
still President of the U.S. and when masked heroes have been outlawed,
a long-time costumed hero/government agent, Edward Blake, is murdered
and another costumed hero/vigilante, Rorschach, suspects that there is
a serial killer picking off costumed heroes. Through the overall plot,
each main character's backstory is explored (think TV's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-The-Complete-Seasons-1-5-Blu-ray/dp/B0021L8FR6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost: The Complete Seasons 1-5 [Blu-ray</a>], which co-creators Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse admit to Watchmen being a major influence) as five major ex-costumed heroes try to bring the killer to justice. The story isn't just full of action, violence, nudity and cussing -- although, it's got that. But it's also about the deep psychology and philosophy rooted in superhero mythology; i.e., separation from one's own humanity and dealing with all the drama and mess that comes with life; living an impotent life when not doing what you feel destined to do; being an uncompromising force in a world that needs compromise; giving in to a lie that you believe will help billions of others; and not facing up to a past of lies that you swore your life by. Each character confronts their own inner demons (most of which made them get into the costumed hero business in the first place), while trying to solve the overall mystery of the killer's motive.

I'm a fan of the graphic novel (albeit not one of those diehard fans) and thoroughly enjoyed the film adaptation. I wouldn't compare it to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight-Digital-Copy-and-BD-Live-Blu-ray/dp/B001GZ6QEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight (+ Digital Copy and BD Live) [Blu-ray</a>] per se because the two movies are different in the sense that ""Knight"" portrays a character that has many stories to choose from, while ""Watchmen"" is a compacted story with a beginning and an ending. Whereas Batman is allowed to have a sequel because there are several stories to tell, ""Watchmen"" has one single story and it's told in all its brilliance. And the movie perfectly captures it all. BTW, just the thought of a sequel to ""Watchmen"" makes me shudder in disgust.

I had heard that some content would be cut from the film, but what was cut was small and didn't make a major difference to the quality of the film. And the ending that Snyder and co. did change made the film better IMHO. One of my favorite aspects ofthe film is that it shows in many ways how screwed up in the head that masked heroes would have to be to do what they do. One of the best scenes is a small scene where Dan/Nite Owl II and Laurie/Silk Spectre II are talking at dinner about an old foe of theirs who dressed up and did crime just so he could be beaten for sexual gratification. When asking what happened to the foe, Dan tells Laurie that he tried it with tough guy Rorschach and the vigilante dropped him down an elevator shaft. After hearing the news, Laurie abrupts in hysterical laughter to which Dan shortly follows suit (in the book, they laugh a lot harder); and I think that the fact that they find it funny proves how twisted they are. A well-played and well-written scene among many.

I won't lie that there is extreme violence in the film and it's not for
the faint of heart, but the overall story is magnificent, nonetheless.
The use of music was brilliant and the fact that Snyder used classic
songs (Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are-A Changing,"" Nat King Cole's
""Unforgettable,"" Simon and Garfunkel's ""Sounds of Silence,"" Leonard
Cohen's ""Hallelujah,"" just to name a few) was compellingly appropriate
seeing how they accompany a comic adaptation that many consider the
classic of all comic stories. Not since the use of Jimi Hendrix's ""Hey
Joe"" in ""Forrest Gump"" have songs been so perfectly matched to a scene!

I commend Snyder and company for their adaptation to a graphic novel that
everyone said was unfilmable. I thought the movie was superb! I just
can't say enough good things about it. I could go on more about this
film but then I'd have to get into talking about specific scenes that
might spoil the movie and its plot, so I'll digress. If you're a fan of
ANY superhero/costumed hero comic book movie or comic books in general,
just see the movie. Of course, it's always better to read the book. And
most diehard fans are going to notice the differences but I know that
what works in a book (as well as its length) might not always work in a
movie. If Snyder didn't put enough in, people would complain about
that. But if he puts too much in, people (critics) complain about that.
I thought he put in the perfect amount, which was nearly everything.
This will definitely be one of the best, most epic comic book movies

WARNING:

'The Ultimate Cut':

With 'The Black Freighter' interwoven into segments throughout the film, it extends the movie to over three and a half hours long and fills in the missing pieces from the graphic novel along with a few other small live-action scenes, that weren't in the 'Director's Cut' and that bookend the 'comic within a comic', making it all the more magnificently epic and unique.  And the extra material is massive, analytic and comprehensive, which is only fair to the fans, who feel milked and cheated, or who just love the 'Watchmen'.

'The Black Freighter' is a grim tale that parallels the lives of different Watchmen, particularly Veidt's and Rorschach's, and their compulsion to fight evil everywhere they think they find it, blinded to the consequences of their actions. Tremendously beautiful yet raw and simplistic animation and the voice of Gerald Butler, bring this intriguing and fan-favorite aspect of the story to life, but it's the effective and pragmatic interweaving of it, that reflects on the Watchmen and stays true to the original source.

In order to match the significance and caliber of the graphic novel, the cinematic version had to embody every thematic nuance and concept behind the 'Watchmen', yet still understand itself as a medium and push the limits of it's own boundaries.  And if the 'Theatrical Cut' didn't than that's exactly what the 'Ultimate Cut' does.

The notion of a fluid time-line, explored by Dr. Manhattan's character and the story's complex degree of structuralism is as prevalent as ever.  The dark realities of nuclear weapons and humanity's abuse of great power are portrayed in the film through the superhero genre as effectively as they are in Moore's literary masterpiece.  The alternative chronology of Cold-War America, defined mostly by the social acceptance of costumed vigilantes, the existence of a superhuman, victory in Vietnam, an endless Nixon presidency and proliferating social rot, reflects upon actual history with profound relevance and cleverly parodies it as well.  The cast of talented but unfamilair actors embraces the moral, emotional and psychological aspects of their characters, and the 'Watchmen' universe is equally fleshed out with over 200 elaborate and painstakingly detailed movie sets, that are literally straight out of the comic.

Inevitably, the plot is altered but constructed in a possibly more coherent manner, due to the controversial but practical trade of the bio-engineered squid fore an even more diabolical scheme to frame Dr. Manhattan.  Also somewhat diverting from the novel, Snyder pays homage to the 80's inserting a few of his own era-specific grace notes via time-capsule references to Lee Iacocca and ""The McLaughlin Group, the film's Reagan generation-friendly soundtrack, head-nods to films like 'Brazil' and 'Apocalypse Now, and capturing the fear and uncertainty felt during the Cold War .

The films depiction of brutality transcends the standard Hollywood repertory of effects; it is more like a cause, a principle.. an ideology. Snyder's marriage to violence exposes the shallow nihilism lurking beneath the intellectual and sophisticated pretensions of 'Watchmen'.

'Watchmen' is a post-modern tale about costumed vigilantes with complicated and true-to-life psychological profiles and a man with god-like earth-shaking powers, trying to function in a world without hope , and it was said to have been impossible to film.  Some tried, and failed before they even began.  It's probably a miracle it took decades to make the movie, Zac Snyder was the right man to do it.

The film is uncompromising, uncommercial, and unprecedented. It's the 'Watchmen' movie you always wanted, but never thought you'd get, but now, even more so.  All the gritty crime-noir, political satire, superhero mythology and science fiction is still there, so unless you forgot or missed the most ambitious, most reverent, most obsessively faithful (to a point) cinematic adaptation of a graphic novel ever and all the stunning and innovative movie magic and gore-porn that went with it, then there won't be much else new for you to get your hopes up for.

O, except maybe for the 3 additional discs with extra material.  The Box it comes in, is pretty snazzy and durable too.

I love 'Watchmen: the Ultimate Cut'. I'm glad I bought it. If you're a fan of the 'Watchmen', and need the complete version of the film, then you'll love it and be glad you bought it too.",1257638400,247,5785,5.191397849462366
3577263,5,B001FB55H6,"One of the darker and most apocalyptic comic book adaptations yet to make it to screen, Watchmen is a super-powered epic in a dystopian world where the lines between right and wrong have been blurred and danger and doom seem to be closing in on all fronts.  It's famous for its darkness and its view of a cynical world, but I think it's going too far to call Watchmen a nihilistic movie.  For every look at the broken society it tales place in, every moment of human depravity, and every shade of despair, there's also an unexpectedly bright glimmer of hope, a chance at redemption, or a moment of tender beauty.  And of course, it all takes place in an action-pached, visually awesome panorama.

  Taking place in an alternate version of 1985 America where superheroes and supervillains have existed since the late 30s and have changed the course of world history (including a quick ending to the Vietnam War that saw Vietnam become the 51st state), Watchmen opens in a dark, cynical world where a nuclear showdown between the U.S. and the Soviet Union seems imminent.  Superheroes - except for those acting under the auspices of the U.S. government - have been banned for several years now, although some rogue crimefighters still continue on in the shadows, such as the masked, highly violent vigilante Rorschach (played by Jackie Earl Haley).  We see through flashbacks how the relationship of superheroes, the general public, and the government had changed over the decades: originally greeted with great enthusiasm, beating back a crime wave in the 30s and 40s and helping to win World War II; the backlash a few years later including the hate crime murder of the openly lesbian superhero Silhouette and her lover, as well as the locking away of various costumed crimefighters into mental hospitals; the superhero rennaissance in the 1950s with the appearance of the first truly superpowered hero, the godlike Dr. Manhattan (played by Billy Crudup); the formation of the Watchmen with sincere hopes of saving the world; and the twilight of the superhero age with conflicting agendas between the heroes and the government, rifts within the superhero community opening up due in part to the increasingly open hyper-violence of characters like the 'superhero' The Comedian, public panic, and finally the banning of costumed crimefighters.  (And this is just the backstory to the main tale!) Which brings us into the movie's present, where Dr. Manhattan is one of the only 'legal' superhumans (who would be difficult to ban even if he weren't working alongside the government - his power surpasses that of the combined might of all the world's conventional and nuclear armies) - and the mentally unbalanced Rorschach leads a brutal one-man war against crime, while possessed of a seering hatred of the very world he's supposedly protecting.  And most of the former costumed heroes have simply slipped back into the fabric of society and are leading relatively 'normal' lives, their secret identities still mostly unknown.

  Yes, it's difficult in the beginning to tell who the good guys are and who the bad guys are, and to some extent even after the movie's conclusion it's up to the viewer to decide who falls under which heading.  It's made somewhat clearer as the flashbacks bring in the long-standing motivations of various characters, as well as their often tragic pasts.  In my mind, by movie's end, there actually are some characters who deserve to be filed as true heroes, there are definately some true villains, and there are a lot who straddle that blurry line.  The lack of the movie clearly identifying in its early chapters who you're 'supposed' to root for and against ends up as a plus rather than a minus and fits in with Watchmen's somewhat non-linear storytelling.

  After Rorschach decides that the death of one of the supposedly retired members of the old Watchmen team was actually a murder, he gets it in his head that someone's coming after all past and present superheroes, and attempts to enlist other former Watchmen to form a resistance.  He also seems to feel that this ties in to some grand conspiracy that's going to usher in the end of the world.  Largely dismissed as paranoid by his former peers - and with understandable reason given his increasingly erratic and hostile behavior in recent years - later events begin to add credence to at least some of Rorschach's theories.  But can he put the remaining members of the Watchmen back together, and if so, will that save the world or somehow destroy it?  In the overall story that, with flashbacks, covers years, we see heroes unable to stop the chaos in the world from spinning out of control and nearly go insane from it; we see heroes fall from grace and try to crawl their way back up; we see villains recognize at last the horrors of their own atrocities and attempt to go straight - or do they?; and we see the most powerful being on the planet slowly start losing the ability to relate to humans or to perceive existance in the same way mortals do.  In many of its instances Watchmen is as it's been touted - heroes struggling in an uphill battle to make a difference, and not always succeeding.  In other cases though it's a case of the Villains doing exactly the same thing - trying to make a difference and not always succeeding.  Because in the minds of most (not all) of the movie's real bad guys, they Think that what they're doing is for the greater good.  And what's even more potent than having them just all be insane with really twisted views of the world, when you see their reasoning and their goals, it often makes a horrifying kind of sense.

  There's more subtext to the movie than could be discussed here.  A few random observations - the musical score and the use of various songs fits in absolutely perfectly with the onscreen happenings; the sudden return of two supposedly retired Watchmen to save the trapped inhabitants of a burning skyscraper is one of the most dramatic and awesome movie moments I've ever seen; the physical battles are incredible; the constantly changing patterns on Rorscach's mask are freaky cool; and Malin Akerman as Silk Spectre II is possibly the sexiest super-heroine yet seen on screen.

  Watchmen succeeds hugely on multiple levels.  It should be noted that though this is a superhero movie, this definately isn't something to get in for your seven year-old Spider-Man/Iron Man fan (those movies are great too, but in a different way).  A grand, disturbing and enthralling epic.",1257552000,,6528,4.844284428442844
3577264,1,B001FB55H6,"I already entered one review, which was not posted, apparently because it was a pure angry rant. I admit that. So this time I thought I'd try to explain why I didn't like it because I feel that science-fiction lovers, such as I, really need to be fore-warned about what they are in for.

I wanted to give this 0 stars, but that's not allowed.

Unless you are prepared to be assaulted with 3 endless hours of non-stop (and extremely graphic) murder, mutilation and dismemberment, avoid this movie. There is nothing to balance all this endless, nauseating violence. Not a single character rises above the level of thrill-killer. There's no one to identify with, or care about. Every character is more-or-less depraved, mostly more.

""Texas Chainsaw Murders"" is way more sophisticated movie-making, character development, and script-writing, except that mega-millions of investment dollars were sent down the tubes on actors and FX in ""Watchmen"".

The ""alternate reality"" is 24/7 nighttime, 24/7 rainfall, 24/7 squalor. It's implausible even in a hypothetical way. (What do people in this world eat, if there's never a ray of sun?) No civilization, even a made-up one, can exist if every person gets his jollies murdering every other person.

I planned to enjoy my dinner while watching it. My dinner was spoiled and my evening ruined. I had to stop it in the middle, but started up again to see if there was somehow a brilliant revelation at the end to make it worth enduring. But that did not happen at all, it was just more of the same ugliness right through to the dopey predictable end.

The actors are all excellent, given the hopelessly .05-dimensional creep characters they have to play. It was really a pleasure to see Stephen McHattie again (before he got a bullet through his head). Billy Crudup is unrecognizable, and thus perhaps this will not be a blot on his otherwise distinguished career.

The special FX are also superb, sometimes fascinating. No fault there, either.

""The Incredibles"" by Pixar handled the same concept with complete brilliance by comparison. This movie amounts to the equivalent of a spoiled adolescent's way of getting attention by beating up smaller kids, breaking their toys, and shouting obscenities. That is the intellectual level of this excuse for a big-budget movie.

The writers, director and producers of this movie should take a lesson from any Japanese anime, in which all the elements of character, plot, love-interest, struggle against opposition, personal demons, temptation, redemption, etc. are carefully handled with sublty and craftsmanship. You will find none of that in this awful flick. What you will find is blood in your face, compound fractures, body parts, splattered screaming corpses, and laughter at murder.  No point to it at all. Repeated over and over.

I really feel that anyone who can sit through three hours of this extremely inhuman, sadistic, in-your-face murder and mutilation of people and their corpses, and say they like it, has real sociopathic tendencies and ought to be under close observation by mental health professionals.",1257465600,21,3104,5.090551181102362
3577265,5,B001FB55H6,Great movie!  It was shipped on time and cost me a fraction of what it was going for in the stores!  What else do you need to know?,1257292800,,131,3.642857142857143
3577266,4,B001FB55H6,"The movie was a little bit dark (the superheroes in this parallel universe literally kill their enemies) but I found it entertaining throughout.  The movie starts with the murder of The Comedian, a sometimes hero, most times a nasty bully acting as a hero.  He was part of a group of masked adventurers called the Watchmen.  Most of the Watchmen were retired but they get together at the funeral and each has their memories of the group that go back to the 1940's.

There is also a ""doomsday"" clock that slowly moves closer to 12:00.  All the television pundits believe that Dr. Manhattan has the answer.  Dr. Manhattan is a brilliant scientist who absorbed a huge radiation blast and became a blue skinned mutant that has the ability to alter his size, teleport and split into different bodies. He also seems to parade around naked much of the time and is not modest about full frontal nudity.  He is the most powerful of the Watchman and is virtually indestructible.

Throughout the movie, the story is focused on on of the Watchmen's quest to find out who is trying to murder the group members and the dark daliances of the Comedian from him trying to rape another hero, to his brutilization of the Vietnamese during the Viet Nam war including the woman who carries his child.

Nixon plays a big part as he was elected to a third term in this parallel world.

3577268,3,B001FB55H6,"First off, I never read the graphic novel, so I won't be comparing it to the movie or vice versa.  Second, I heard that Alan Moore wouldn't even let his graphic-novel writing credit into the movie, which prompted me to do a little digging into Alan Moore.  Frankly, he sounds like he'd be a difficult person to live with or be friends with.  In fact, he's probably ramping up for next year's Renaissance Fair in Sterling Forest, a supposition based on the photos of him that I've seen, the recent, odd publications he's produced and the biographies I've read about him.

That being said, I came away from ""Watchmen"" rather impressed.  The opening credits are done exceptionally well, presenting a history of the Watchmen group circa 1940 from its inception to its existence in the movie's present day of 1985, with Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are a-Changin'"" as the song (which is pretty good, even though I don't generally like Dylan's voice).  Later on, there's a fantastic scene where the Comedian and a giant Dr. Manhattan are fighting in the Vietnam War with Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" playing, not to mention a post-war Vietnam bar incident.  Wow.

My big issue with ""Watchmen"" was the sheer ridiculousness of the superhero, which in this film generally constitutes nothing more than a human being running around in a costume fighting for the good old U.S. of A.  Some of their names add to the silliness, namely ""Silk Spectre"" and ""Ozymandias.""  And why does Rorschach's mask have moving bloodstains when his face doesn't?  Unexplained.

The Comedian, played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan (from the ""Supernatural"" TV series), and Nite Owl II, played by Patrick Wilson, are the best characters in the movie.  Morgan steals every scene he's in with profane sass and violent behavior.  Outstanding job.  Wilson's Nite Owl is the kindest superhero of the bunch and, for that reason, is the most likeable.  The ""Silk Spectre II"" character, played by Malin Akerman, also has quite a few redeeming qualities.

Although I'm sure it's all pretty much computer-generated, there's WAY TOO MUCH of Dr. Manhattan's swingin' blue pepe in this movie.  I'm surprised no one in the movie--the Comedian, for instance--makes any cracks about it.  That would be the first thing I would say: ""Hey, Manhattan, could you put some pants on!  I don't wanna get poked in the eye, you know.""

All in all, the movie is worth watching, but be prepared to be somewhat confused about all the goings on in the movie (i.e. if you haven't read the graphic novel).  I had to go back and review a few sections after my first viewing in order to gain some clarity as to who was who and what was what.  Plus there were a few impressive scenes I wanted to see again.  I think there's so much going on in ""Watchmen"" that it turned some people off (""Transformers"" crowd) and annoyed some fanboys because it couldn't cinematically do enough justice to the heavy, involved storyline.  You've really got to stay focused throughout the entire movie to catch every detail.",1257120000,,3032,4.806949806949807

It was a great alternate world adventure, perhaps a little too obsessed with lingering on unsavory details and gore, but communicating pretty well to a non-follower. A labor of love, certainly, and probably a blueprint for how many movies will look in the future. The Rohrschach character was the best, with some awesome scenes and at least one highly memorable one- (or maybe two-) liner. After a little time probably worth watching more than once or twice.",1256860800,,702,4.669354838709677
3577340,4,B001FB55H6,"Because of the publicity put up by the aggressive marketing by its distributors, I had decided to read Alan Moore's Graphic Novel first before watching the movie.

Alan Moore's 'Watchmen' had been one of the unsurpassed graphic novels I have ever read in a long time. Those who have not read the novel, the story of 'Watchmen' exist in an alternate reality where Americans have won the Vietnam War, Nixon had been elected three consecutive times for the successful drive in Vietnam and the Superheroes/Vigilantes are the part of the Society. This story originated at the peak of the Cold War, and what kept the Russians form launching an aggressive campaign against U.S. was due to the presence of Dr. Manhattan (enacted by Billy Crudup). Due to the violent methods of providing justice, the superheroes had become detested among the public, thus leading to pass of Legislation Act which outlawed them. Though most of the heroes accepted forced retirement, two of them had been kept of the book 'Dr. Manhattan' & 'The Comedian' as they were working on Government's surveillance. Only 'Rorschach' was one of the vigilantes who had not accepted the act and continued his work undercover.

The story starts with the murder of one of the vigilante 'The Comedian' followed by an independent investigation taken up by Rorschach; likewise we get introduced to all the other Superheroes who were given the name 'Watchmen'. First half is mostly flashback which introduces us to the characters at the same time it slowly carries the story to the core Novel's Climax.

This movie could have been way much better. The entire novel was full of intensity. Some of the characters seemed to be less developed in this adaptation other than Rorschach, which was done marvelously by Jackie Earle Haley. Even Dr. Manhattan's tone didn't seem true. Though most of the content had been taken directly from the novel still some segment looked consciously altered to mesh with the alternate ending. Even 'Tales Of The Black Freighter' was not included within the movie which I think can be justified with the limitation of the time constraint.

Visually this movie is stunning packed with slow paced action which we have already seen in Zack Snyder's 300, with some of the musical tracks of the late 80's. Unlike other Comic based movies, this movie had been too brutal for which it got easily 'R' Rating.

There could have been lot of potential to make this story a magnum opus keeping true to the content of Alan Moore. Anyone who has not read the novel will not be able to realize what have failed actually while recreating this into a big motion picture.

Looking at the efforts undertaken I would prefer to give it a solid 6/10.

New Update: Director's Cut

Well on seeing the Director's Cut I felt good, may be this was the better adaptation compared to the Theatrical Release.

It seems that after each viewing this Movie is really turning out to be good. Its strange that on the first screening I had been very skeptical but later on it did click for me. May be I should have given it more chance.

3577341,4,B001FB55H6,"The Bottom Line:

A long film that doesn't feel long, Watchmen is an astonishing visual experience (for all his faults director Zach Snyder sure can craft a pretty frame) that has its flaws--the scenes with Rorschach work far better than anything with Matthew Goode or Patrick Wilson and Malin Akerman, some of the flashbacks don't make much sense to neophytes--but Jackie Earle Haley is great, the CGI is very effective, and the film works as *spectacle* even when it fails a little as a story; no one can deny that Watchman has issues, but it succeeds despite them.

I cared and identified with the characters. I understand they came from a popular comic book but it was all new to me. And that made it all the more impressive that I was drawn into their world, a very serious world with a history that was different and compelling. I can't imagine a sequel. I hope one isn't made since it would surely diminish the accomplishment that was this movie.

3577343,5,B001FB55H6,"When this movie came out the attitude around it was it was another superhero movie, but those who had read the graphic novel knew better (I was not one of these people).  After seeing the movie and then reading the book afterward I realized why this was such a groundbreaking show that surprisingly moves with the book.  Overall it's a movie that should not be presented to young children without the much tamer version of book form being seen first.  Even at that parents should decide if their children can handle some of the more graphic scenes in this cinematic and cultural ride.",1256515200,,584,4.650485436893204

On the '""dark side"" of the light spectrum, wich ads to the dark overtones in the plot. The final hour or so (from when Rorscach is busted out of the slammer, and the Mars scenes with Dr. Manhattan) is real eye candy. I've used it several times as a demo for friends that have not seen Blu Ray yet, and get the dropped jaw response every time! Fun stuff, and a great soundtrack (All Along the Watchtower by Hendrix- too much!!) make for a very entertaining film.",1256515200,,571,4.447619047619048
3577345,3,B001FB55H6,"While the movie has well-written costumed vigilantes performed by above-average actors, the movie ran like a re-telling of the graphic novel verbatim.  The movie itself is so long, the additions provided by the director's cut are forgettable.  The last forty-five minutes are still the best part of the movie.

Blu-ray helps with the visuals; but does not accentuate the storytelling.  Unless you are an avid Blu-ray fan like myself, Watchmen can be viewed in regular DVD Video format.",1256428800,3,485,5.17948717948718
3577346,2,B001FB55H6,"""Watchmen"" was, for many years, the project considered impossible to film.  This movie proves that ""Watchmen"" was, indeed, possible to film, but that doing so may have been a bad idea.

The major problem with this movie is not its length.  It's way, way too long - but that's a symptom of the problem, which is lack of focus.  Act 1 takes a long time to develop, and when it's over an hour or so into the movie, there's an unsettling feeling you get as the audience that comes from the fact that you don't know what the plot is even after 60 minutes.  Then, when the movie finally gets some focus, it's on - Nite Owl and Silk Spectre?  Huh?  The least interesting characters?  Rorschach is a jerk, but has a kind of purity as a character that makes him interesting.  Veidt, who is almost an afterthought in this movie, has a kind of purity about his character as well, but in a different way; he has chosen to follow ideals that may vary from Rorschach's, or that may be the same but implemented differently.  The ultimate confrontation in ""Watchmen"" is really between Veidt and Rorschach, so it's a shame Veidt is given such short shrift in most of the movie.  Veidt, rather than a central protagonist (antagonist?), is the Oliver Twist of the movie, the cipher whose motives and character just happen to be there because they're in the script.  Instead of developing Veidt, we get some unconvincing romance between Nite Owl and Silk Spectre, some overly long scenes on Mars, and a variety of other bits not important to the plot.  Not great from a storytelling perspective.

Several shots and musical choices in this long, long movie were so hamhanded as to stand out from the remainder in an unfavorable way.  Why a minute-long crane shot prior to the Comedian's funeral?  That thing must have taken an entire day to shoot on its own, for no good end.  ""99 Luftballons"" as Silk Spectre meets Nite Owl for dinner?  At high volume?  For a long time?  There are many points in Watchmen where I wished the director would just get on with it.  Deliberate pacing is one thing, and can be very effective.  But there's a difference between deliberate pacing, and lingering over nothing.

And speaking of hamhandedness, I agree with the main review that ""Watchmen"" seems like a transcription of the graphic novel at times.  Nowhere is that more obvious than the Rorschach origin scene.  A single frame of something horrific on the printed page has tremendous visceral impact.  Playing that out in an actual segment of movie is too much, and is over the top.  In addition, the 70s style depiction of New York as a cesspool of horrors each worse than the last is likely to be incomprehensible to younger viewers who did not live through the era of the bankruptcy of NYC.  The similar depiction of the constant threat of nuclear annihilation brought back some memories, but will be equally unfamiliar to younger viewers.  These underlying moods of the film lead to some jarring tonal shifts, and render ""Watchmen"" ultimately a serious downer.

Geeks of a certain age, like myself, were going to watch this no matter what.  I can't recommend doing so, but if you're like me, you're going to do it anyway.  Save a few bucks and just rent this one.",1256256000,8,3236,4.632688927943761
3577347,4,B001FB55H6,"How you feel about this film is largely dependent on how you feel about the original Watchmen graphic novel. If you have not read the novel or couldn't get into it, then you are likely to find the movie to be baffling and boring. The Watchmen story is, among other things, a complex dissection of the often fascist cultural impulses behind the very concept of superheroes rather than the superhero-based action adventure that many people expected when they went to the theaters. It's a talky, introspective, pessimistic story - not at all a good candidate for a summer blockbuster, as the studio tried to portray it. During my original viewing, a number of people walked out of the theatre. Some, no doubt, were turned off by the story's politics, but most simply weren't getting what they expected from a superhero movie.

Compounding the difficulty of the story's content is its structure. Originally released as a series of separate comic books that were later combined to form the graphic novel, the Watchmen story is episodic with far too many protagonists for a feature film to manage. For years the novel was considered un-filmable by would-be producers and directors. Ideally, the best film adaption for Watchmen would be as a mini-series that enables the nuances of each episode to be fully realized and that didn't require viewers to digest such a sprawling tale in a single sitting. Feature films, however, are where the money is at and after his success with the comic-based, 300, Zack Snyder was hired to give it a try. That he's succeeded as well as he has is impressive. That he made a less than perfect movie was pre-ordained by the nature of the source material.

The principle flaw with Snyder's Watchmen film is that it takes a really long time to get to the main action of the plot. In this three hour movie, the first two hours are spent establishing the numerous characters and setting up the background for the story. For people like me who worship the novel and are fascinated by the world and characters of Watchmen, this is engaging. For the casual movie-goer, though, it's boring. The only way for Snyder to have avoided this flaw and paced the story better would have been to streamline the plot, reducing or eliminating several of the characters. That this didn't happen is actually surprising since butchering great novels to make formulaic features is, after all, the main business of Hollywood. Many critics who complained about the film's ""excessive"" loyalty to the novel supposedly would have preferred such a streamlined version. And yet I wonder if they would have then complained about the changes made to the original story. A cut-down version of the Watchmen story might have resulted in a more commercially successful movie, but then it would not have been Watchmen. I'm glad that Snyder stayed loyal to the novel, even if this does result in an imperfect film. Movies get judged too much these days by how much money they make. Watchmen did not become the blockbuster that supposedly all superhero movies must become, but it is the best possible feature film version of Watchmen and wonderfully translates the classic novel to the screen. For fans of the novel, like me, it's a wonderful film.",1255996800,4,3234,4.856884057971015
3577348,1,B001FB55H6,"If 0 stars was an option, I would have chosen it. The action was alright, and some of the toys and costumes were alright.

I didn't like the plot...a good guy turning bad, killing his own kind/friends...and trying to destroy the world...lame! People want happy endings, especially if they are going to see a superhero movie. Finally, my biggest problem with this movie was entirely too much blue schlong!!! I mean, if they would have had a shot where they ""glanced"" over it as the camera was panning to something else, that would have been enough. But NOOOO...they had full on 30 second shots with him walking towards you or just standing there with that smurfy blue prosthetic thing hanging there. Why would I pay all that money to see a superhero/action movie, then see some fake smurf weenie for half the movie. I would have walked out if I hadn't spent so much on the bloody movie...and also I was in the middle of a dark theater and would have tripped all over everyone trying to get down the aisle.

3577413,4,B001FB55H6,"THE MOVIE:

Set in an alternate 1985 where costumed crime-fighters stalk the streets and the Cold War is on the brink of nuclear armageddon, Watchmen portrays a society that is more morally complex than depicted in traditional superhero fiction, a society where it is more difficult to tell the difference between right and wrong, good and bad.

Whilst the Theatrical version of Watchmen was still a faithful rendering of the source material it omitted several integral elements, most notable the book-within-the-book concept: `The Tales of the Black Freighter'. By re-integrating `The Tales of the Black Freighter' as animated interstitials into the Director's Cut of the movie, the Ultimate Cut is a much more layered, satisfying and complete adaptation of the landmark graphic novel that deconstructed the superhero genre. This creates a truly remarkable vision that is something more special than the previous versions. In this respect, the Ultimate Cut should be considered the ""Definitive Edition"" - if not quite the masterpiece for which we were hoping. The main thing that spoilt the suspension of disbelief for me were Moloch's massively distracting Orc-like ears: 'Spock meets Nosferatu'.

THE EXTRAS:

Disc 2 imports the bonus material provided with the Theatrical and Director's Cut releases. The Four main documentaries are all worthy of inclusion and concentrate on the origin of the graphic novel, its themes, and subsequent impact.

The pseudo-documentary `Under the Hood' is a fun 60-Minutes-style pastiche that provides more backstory and details from the graphic novel that are missing from the feature films.

The Video Journals deal with the making of the movie but (putting the lack of a PLAY ALL option aside) it would have been nice if there was a more in-depth making-of feature to take us through all the stages of this ambitious production - Especially one that covered the casting of the movie, its troubled release and the abandoned previous incarnations. (The inclusion of a few trailers would have also been welcome.) So this cynic suspects a Deluxe-Ultimate Anniversary Edition in the pipeline at Warners.

Instead of the obligatory, annoying Digital Copy, just a simple DVD of the Theatrical Cut would have been better (like Disney includes with all of their blu-rays), or even nothing at all. Hopefully film companies will abandon the Digital Copy fad altogether. Personally, I'd prefer no additional copy and a few pennies shaved off the price instead.

Rounding off the package, at 325 minutes, is the exhaustive (arguably gimmicky) Motion Comic - But at least it's broken into 12 episodes, like the 12 chapters of the novel, and should satiate completists' appetites.

On a final note, the 3 main discs come packaged in a fold-out card case (with the Motion Comic in a slim plastic blu-ray case) inside a card box. The only problem with this nifty packaging is that the matt finish tends to flake away on the edges and creases of the box. (""Somebody call Quality Control!"")

These disappointments aside, Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut is definitely the version fans have been waiting for and as all of the discs are REGION FREE, it is available for everyone to make up their own minds. It is certainly an adaptation Alan Moore should be pleased with...but he probably won't be.

3577417,3,B001FB55H6,"After ""V for Vendetta"" and ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,"" I had less than high hopes for Zack Snyder's film adaptation of Alan Moore's most acclaimed graphic novel.  So does Hollywood kill ""Watchmen,"" too?  Not really.  Then is it everything fans dreamed it would be?  Not really.

The comic, about a plot to kill and discredit former superheroes in the 80s, is a multi-layered story with a lot of ground to cover.  The film cuts into the meat, keeps the best parts, takes out the bones, and leaves all the blood.  This is probably the most faithful comic-based movie you'll ever see.  From Jackie Earl Haley's Rorschach to Billy Crudup's Dr. Manhattan, ""Watchmen"" doesn't seem so horribly miscast either.  It's the sheer weight of it all, the daunting task of bringing so much style and substance together, that leaves the film in the gray area between sweet success and utter failure.  But the real joke is even the 24 minutes of extra footage in the Director Cut couldn't get the film up there with ""Spider-Man"" or ""X-Men.""  So who watches the Watchmen?  Just the fans.

I only knew that it was a different 'spin' on the 'Justice Society/Justice League' chronology, involving a unique set of heroes and an alternate version of our reality.

""Watchmen"", the movie, is much, much, more, and stands, with ""The Dark Knight"", as the most provocative, unconventional, and brilliant reinventions of the genre, since Tim Burton 'reinvented' Batman, in the eighties.

First off, it debunks the classic superhero 'origin' story. These are not noble scientists or rich philanthropists, who don costumes to hide their indentities and achieve their 'higher calling'...many of this group were cops, who, when criminals discovered wearing masks and costumes made it impossible to identify and prosecute them, donned masks, themselves, to do what the courts couldn't: exact justice. Most of these 'costumed heroes' had no 'special skills' other than as brawlers, and the confrontations with masked criminals had more of a carnival sideshow 'feel' than anything really heroic. And these 'heroes', being regular people, had all the human foibles; some were sadists, one heroine was a lesbian, another would be raped, and all had some degree of ego problems. Yet the public loved them, and when, in the 40s, a group banded together, they achieved the same kind of public adoration as the Justice Society would, in their world. As time passed, however, age and changing mores would create a 'changing of the guard'...one hero, Nite Owl (a variation of Batman), would retire, replaced by a technology geek (Patrick Wilson), who added 'toys' large and small, to enhance his skills; another (Carla Gugino) would be replaced by her daughter (Malin Akerman); the world's richest, most brilliant intellectual (Matthew Goode) would use his resources to enhance his abilities and create a nearly superhuman persona; a child abuse victim (Jackie Earle Haley) would don a cowl with ever-changing patterns, and become a hard-core 'Dirty Harry'-type vigilante...and the world's first true 'superpowered' hero (Billy Crudup) would appear, a man who, when accidently bathed in nuclear energy, lost his physical form, becoming a nude blue creature of nearly limitless power, but a fading understanding of humanity. Joined by the one 'carry-over' from the first generation, the handsome, if disgusting 'Comedian' (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a new team is created...which is really where the movie begins!

It is 1985, a caricatured version of Richard Nixon (Robert Wisden), is in his umpteenth term as President, the world is at the brink of nuclear war, and the 'superheroes', with the exception of Crudup's 'Dr. Manhattan', have been ordered to retire, following a carnage-fueled American 'victory' of the Vietnam war. Other than Haley ('Rorschach'), who went into hiding, everyone has complied, willingly...but when the Comedian is brutally murdered, and other ex-heroes are targeted, Rorschach suspects a far more sinister purpose than simply revenge, and tries, unsuccessfully, to get his former colleagues to join him in a search for answers. He was right, of course, and as we learn more about the heroes' lives and backstories, a truly riveting tale of ambition, morality, and 'greater good' emerges, that kept me 'hooked'. While I saw elements of Frank Miller's ""The Dark Knight Returns"" on several occasions, I'd never seen a universe so carefully and logically 'fleshed out', onscreen, and it was simply stunning.

I won't give away anything else about this remarkable film...only to recommend it, enthusiastically, if you love this kind of film as much as I do...You won't be disappointed!",1253836800,,3868,5.32569558101473

3577555,5,B001FB55H6,I am very impressed with this movie; 5 of 5 stars. Just watched the extended Director's cut making it a very very long movie. The story is very complex with alot of flash-backs and even some flash-forwards. Several stories are intermixed until they finally all come together. Great characters. Unique style of photography and vision. I just added this to my list of favorites.

3577559,5,B001FB55H6,"The Director's Cut is definitely an upgrade from the original version of this film. Haven't read the comic book, I liked the film when I watched it at cinemas, but felt something was missing, maybe more soul. I was greatly satisfied to see this version completed in everything the theatrical cut. The story flows better since we get more information and character's development, so we are more easily drawn into the movie and even more interested. The three hours long weren't tiresome at any moment for me, which I think is something to praise the director, since we are watching a hero drama here. This is a more human film than the theatrical version also, you get more time to love and understand this broken people, the menace of the war feels more real, and the idea of how we men are uncapable of save ourselves, don't say the world, is much more implied.

My only  dissapointment is that the 2 disc DVD didn't come with the 3-d cover case showed in the picture, I don't know why. Yet, it was nothing to lessen the excellence of the film itself. Should have put on TV spots and trailers as well, I'm not the only one to think the second disc still had too much space to fill!",1253145600,,1182,4.442396313364055

The very minor changes in the movie, the lack of the pirate comic and the details at the end I think made it better.  The ending seemed a bit more believable.  I didn't care for the pirate comic that much reading the graphic novel, and still really didn't get any connection with it and the rest of the story.

When I heard there was going to be a movie, I immediately said it should be done like Lord of the Rings; that is a long movie released in 3 parts.  I was actually pleased the movie was done as well as it was in a shortened format.  Spoiler alert! The only deviation, and part I didn't like was making Dr. Manhattan the fall guy for a sinister plot instead of creating the alien form that was transported to New York to fool the world into thinking they needed to unite to defeat an alien attack.  Other than that, I feel the script/novel was followed close enough, the actors were perfectly chosen for their parts, and the overall movie was excellent.  I did miss Captain Metroplis who actually chaired the first, and only, meeting of the Crimebusters.",1252713600,3,819,4.469798657718121
3577720,2,B001FB55H6,"I was not familiar with Watchmen prior to seeing the movie trailers so consider my review that of the casual fan.  I had seen the trailers for the movie back when it was in the theater, but it didn't crack the list of those that I shell out $8+ to go see.  However, it did make it into the category of movies watched at home on a rainy evening.

What I wound up seeing was not exactly what I expected.  The Watchmen are ""retired"" if you will by presidential edict after generations of superheroes have played a part in shaping the history of the Twentieth Century.  The story picks up in 1985 when The Comedian is murdered by a mysterious intruder to his apartment.  What ensues is a fairly convoluted and slowly developing story of why he was killed and who did it.  Along the way we learn about Dr. Manhattan, a physicist who is no longer human after a laboratory accident.  He is working with Adrian Veidt; the only Watchmen to come forward with his secret identity who is know a multi-billionaire attempting to tap into infinite energy in the hopes of ending the need for all war - particularly the US/USSR Cold War.  Laurie Jupiter, aka Silk Spectre II, is in love with Dr. Manhattan, but he no longer seems capable of human emotion or connection.  Then there is Dab Dreiberg, aka Night Owl II, who is independently well off thanks to his inheritance.  All he seems to have going to regular visits with the original Night Owl where they discuss their past conquests over beer.

However, the main - and easily the most interesting character - is Rorschach whose mask changes into various Rorschach images in a seemingly spontaneous fashion.  He is a sociopath who is down on the human race for the way that everyone was seemed to give in to vices and gluttony.  Watchmen is at its core the story of his investigation of The Comedian's murder with the rest as a backdrop.  His gruff attitude is somewhat reminiscent of Wolverine (of X-Men fame, of course), and he has the same lone wolf playing by his own rules approach as well.

What I found odd about The Watchmen is that other than Dr. Manhattan, they mostly seem to have physical combat as their ""superpower"".  The fight scenes are of about the caliber of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  The Watchmen also seem to lack any leader in contrast to other superhero groups such as The Fantastic Four, The X-Men, and Justice League.  It's just not what the typical comic book/superhero fan is going to be looking for.

It is also earns its R rating with plenty of language and a few sex scenes so do not give into any pleading from your kids to see Watchmen.

At just under three hours, it also falls into that category of movies that you think is never going to end.  There are very few movies that have enough steam to give the viewer engaged for that long, and this is not one of them.

Overall Recommendation:  Rent",1252713600,6,2866,4.488416988416988

3577722,5,B001FB55H6,"Absolutely fantastic. So much did I enjoy this that since it's purchase I have watched it no less than 5 times and every time I pick up on things I missed the previous time. The story at first seemed a little dis-jointed but as you progress further into the film it gets quite enjoyable and has you wanting more, wanting it to come faster and faster, at nearly 3 hours long (directors cut) it flew by, most films I have watched in the past (unless you are at the pictures whereby you cannot always get up to go to the loo for being made to feel like a heel and missing part of the film) you can put on pause to make a cuppa etc. This film had me glued to my seat for the whole 3 hours, as a SCI-Fi (freak) lover I usually watch all films with an open mind deciding later whether I like them or not and make an opinion over a few days, if I cannot decide I watch the film again - this film however had me wanting to watch it again straight away (had I have got the time I maybe would have done so)Set in an alternative 1980's against the cold war between the superpowers, it is a very political film in all ways, from Nixon's 3rd term in office to the personal politics between the characters the film is named after in fact as 'watchmen' they do the exact opposite and get involved to catastophic consequences, 'do the means justify the ends' you will have to watch the film to make up your own mind, I did and loved every minute. Everyone who I know that has watched this film have a fave character and we all love the same one, who will be yours. The film uses all modern tech to put across an absolutely stunning piece of not only story telling but cinematography from stills to slow motion, most of the film is done in semi-darkness which you would think would detract from the overall experience, but like the latest batman film I think it not only enhanced but superceded the experience they were trying to get across. All in all terrific to see a graphic novel portrayed even better than the '300', although the director did a great job on that film, on this one it would seem he was the only choice. 10/10 all round.

3577725,3,B001FB55H6,"The first half of this movie was pretty intriguing. I don't hold it against the director for making it rather Blade Runnerish. However, by the second half, forget it! Talk about convaluted! Christ Mr. Snyder, but most of the people watching this movie were raised on MTV and video games. Give us a break! I don't think Siskel and Ebert on their best day could follow the second half!

The more positive attribute is Jackie Earle Hailey's Rorschach. His performance demonstrated a perfect marriage of both the visceral AND the cerebral. THIS IS WORTHY OF AN OSCAR NOD!

Being the only one I've seen that is all I will address here.  Utter disappointment.  But then when you've been waiting for a movie for 23 years how can it not disappoint.  We all have our perfect Watchmen in our head and no matter how good a job the director did it would never match up.  It is a project that was doomed from the start.  Lost in this movie version was what made the book so compelling.  The book seemed to go out of it's way to show how ridiculous the very idea of superheroes are.  The idea of putting on a costume and picking fights with strangers is, on the surface, laughable.  In the end our ""heroes"" were completely ineffectual.  In the movie version, however, a great deal of time and money seemed to be spent on making them look cool.  Night owl goes from a paunchy middle aged recluse to a ripped leading man.  Roscharch goes from a nearly homeless loser to a gritty anti-hero.  And Silk Spectre from a 30 something has been with daddy issues to a va va voom sex kitty.  And on and on.  But this is just Watchmen through my personal prism.  Every fan takes something else from the book and finds that particular bit the most important.
So in the end he tried his best and he should be congratulated for what he accomplished.  But unfortunately for ocd fans like me it will never be enough.",1252368000,,1456,4.271062271062271
3577729,5,B001FB55H6,"I don't know why there are so many negative reviews out there. If you don't like comic book stories, then of course, this movie is not for you.  I think the story is pretty deep...especially the ending. You need to see the consequences of the very ending to appreciate it and the irony behind the whole concept. As for the movie itself, I have read the comic books and I think the director and producers did a great job of re-creating the comic book...almost frame by frame as I remember it, with a few adjustments to accommodate a more realistic process for a movie.  The ONLY things I felt were lacking and that could have done better were:
1. The President Nixon portrayal. Come on...this guy looked so obviously like he was wearing so much make-up and plastic that he looked almost comical and satirical. Couldn't they have found an actor who looked close to Nixon?? The makeup used on him looked so fake and stiff!

2. The only boring parts of the movie are the dialogue scenes between Dan and Lori. I know they were being true to the comic, but those were mostly the only parts where you can do something else or let your mind wander.  Oh...and the sex scenes were pretty graphic for a comic book movie...not for the under 18 crowd (I think I saw the Director's Cut).

3. I think the actor for John Manhattan was ok and he did LOOK like the comic (with the help of computer graphics), but I think they really should have picked an actor who's voice was deeper and more hollow-like. The actor they chose has a meek or light voice and sounds very wimpy. This is not the voice you probably imagine when you're reading the comic book. I don't know why they went with this actor.  They could have even enhanced his voice with special effects...but they kept it sounding so wimpy....this is NOT the Dr. Manhattan I imagined.

Other than those minor complaints, I think the movie was very good and I think Jackie Earle Haley steals the show as he did such a great job, in my opinion.  I don't see why people are saying that if you like the comic, you will be disappointed with the movie. It was almost exactly like the comic book up until the last 1/5 of the movie....what's to be disappointed?? Did you want to see something that wasn't in the comic??  (aside from the fact that they left out the Black Freighter comic sequences...but I heard they will incorporate those scenes with an Ultimate Edition due out later this year).",1252281600,,2428,4.462753950338601
3577770,5,B001FB55H6,"A blood spattered Smiley-face button kisses the street following the pavement plastering of its owner. Is he one of the superheroes so revered from the ""Watchmen"" comic book? Do comic book superheroes die like this? I thought not. Questions such as these are quite apropos for someone like me who can't remember flipping a single page from this genre of literature. Theretofore, it must be duly noted that this production, adapted from Alan Moore's classic graphic novel is anti-typically at odds with your everyday blue-collar superhero, however; this is the principle ingredient which makes it so memorably special.

Considering that Watchmen tip-toes off the celestial heels of the most successful comic book film ""The Dark Knight,"" I sincerely had my doubts of its capableness. ""Tip-toes,"" dare I say? No...it catapults and soars within the stratosphere of The Dark Knight, and should be saluted akin to this decorated four-star general.

The story circles the lives of six satirical neophytes; unlikely crime fighters that pick up where an initial post World War II band leaves off in the late 60's - early 70's. Even superheroes aren't immune to the effects of time, so it is this new group upon which the central plot revolves. Unfortunately, their time and effort is short lived when the ""Keene Act"" bill is passed by Congress in 1977, banning costumed crime fighting or masked vigilantes.

Whimsically, skip forward to 1985, Nixon in his third term of presidency, and the remnant of all their inspirational gallantry has trickled down to mere common recollection.  Ordinarily, this circumstance wouldn't be so austere, but the majority of these 'recollections' are filled with petulance and indifference, while a nuclear holocaust is at large.

Jackie Earle Haley adeptly plays the psychoneurotic inkblot-masked man, Rorschach. Intrinsically, the shifting Guernsey-mask is `his face.' He is the one `super member', who remains dedicated to his political convictions, detesting both communists and liberals. Lines are never blurred, but, always crossed with his mindset. During an argument with Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), Rorschach summarizes his stance on evil; ""Never compromise. Not even in the face of Armageddon. That's always been the difference between us."" Embedded at the forefront of the tangled plot, Rorschach's contributions are immense. Why does Nixon not absolutely adore this guy? Come winter, Hayley should be adored with yet another ""Oscar-worthy"" Best Supporting Actor nomination. He's that uncompromisingly good.

A complicated love saga involves the aforementioned Nite Owl II, Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), and Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman). Dr. Manhattan, the lone superhero with true superhuman powers, is the apple of Nixon's political eye. He and the sexy long-legged Silk Spectre II are subsidized by the government to prevent national threats and crisis, and live together on a military base. But when Manhattan disappears to Mars, her subsidy disappears with him, so she begins co-habitating with Dan, a.k.a. Nite Owl II. Her ambivalent feelings towards Manhattan create some imposingly erotic moments between her and Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson); notably one set to Leonard Cohen's moody ""Hallelujah."" Wilson and Ms. Akerman play their roles with pizzazz and a sultry sort of jazz. Crudup shines as the detached and reluctant ""savior."" 'Shine' is the proper verb to describe Dr. Manhattan, being that he also resembles blue halogen on HGH. It's not his fault.

Rounding out the disjointed crew includes ""The Comedian"" (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), ""Adrien"" Veidt, a.k.a. Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), not to mention Carla Gugino as Silk Spectre II's mother, ""Silk Spectre I."" The Comedian, a.k.a. Edward Blake; a very intriguing charter member of the club for the most part appears in flashbacks. There's a worthy explanation for this, which I don't care to spoil. He dawns a very cynical and mischievous observation on crime fighting and life in the 80's. Speaking with Dan Dreiberg a.k.a. Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), in answering his question, ""What happened to us? What happened to the American Dream?"" The Comedian retorts with conviction, ""What happened to the American Dream? It came true! You're lookin' at it..."" And as Bob Dylan chimes away in his philosophical song of reveille, ""Then you better start swimmin'...or you'll sink like a stone...for the times they are a-changin'. Contrary to The Comedian's ulterior belief, it's not ""all a joke."" Jeffrey Dean Morgan is consummately cast for this conflicted persona.

Now retired, Gugino's character, Silk Spectre I adds a pleasant aroma to the entire spicy mix...very integral to the story. Whereas Spectre II (Malin Akerman) packs a fervent visual punch in her dominatrix ensemble, it is my estimation that Spectre I exudes the indelible attitude.

Directed by Zach Snyder of ""300"" infamy, Watchmen is also a visually stunning acclamation. The kaleidoscopic contours alone make the hairs on forearms rise to attention. Mine surely did. The sound effects are superb, especially during the pugilistic scenes, of which there are many.

No...I can't remember flipping a page of any comic book in my lifetime, and as long as momentous films like ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Watchmen"" continue infiltrating theatres, the thought should never come to mind. In other words, the prevailing narrative and perceptive illustrations, add so much to the integral mechanics, that a 'must-read' of Alan Moore's graphic novel may simply be considered an afterthought.",1252108800,3,5541,5.351320321469575

3577773,5,B001FB55H6,"Watchmen was absolutely everything I wanted it to be and so much more.  It's a perfect adaptation that literally uses the graphic novel as its script.  The panel for panel imitation was very exciting to see for the first time on the big screen.  Everyone I talk to who has not read the book, dislikes the movie overall.  I can see that it must be hard to get sucked into this film without reading the graphic novel.  However, the overall consensus for those who have read the comic, consider it possibly the best comic book movie of all time.  Zack Snyder directed the movie we thought was impossible.  And he did it better than we could have imagined.

I keep hearing the insulting complaints as to the male nudity in the movie.  How are we, a country, so sexist that when we see male nudity in a movie we instantly yell and scream and insult the ones enjoying the film.  Malin was nude as well in this movie, and not a lot of people seemed to complain about that.  I'm not a homosexual, but due to the fact im well aware of my own anatomy, the whole naked Dr. Manhattan didn't bother me that much.  He wasn't plastered across the whole screen.  I could easily focus on another area of the screen.  I hardly notice it when I watch the blu-ray at home.  Grow up people, we all have reproductive organs.

On a completely different side-note, I'm pretty satisfied with the release's special features.  The commentary was a lot of fun and the behind the scenes were very interesting.  I hoped for more, but this was better than nothing.  One point I do want to bring up is this :""Directors, if a viewer is watching a commentary, assume that they have already watched the film and now important plot points.""  I'm tired of useless commentary where all I hear is ""This is a scene where Dr. Manhattan talks to Laurie.  I know, I've seen the movie!  Narrating the plots of the film is entirely useless.  We're watching the movie, we know whats going on.  I'd rather hear, ""In this scene we used this for this and It was a challenge to execute this""  Blu-ray commentaries need evolution.

I haven't spoken much on the film, because it's really indescribable.  You need to view it for yourself and be subject to the unique experience.  It's like nothing you've seen before and it breaks barriers of previous superhero movies.  I'll reccomend renting first, just because the reviews are so diverse on this product.  Some will love it and some will hate it.  Thats the very interesting thing about it.  It commands so much thought from us and the world has quite a discussion about it.  Bad movies go unnoticed.  Controversial movies get argued over for a long time. Watchmen is a controversial movie  that will absolutely change your world even if you appreciate it or not.  It's a revolutionary film, by the talented Zack Snyder.",1252022400,,2820,4.547808764940239
3577774,5,B001FB55H6,"The controversy and difficulties in bringing this classic graphic novel to the big screen have reached mythological, if not absurd proportions. Moore's original vision, and his resistance to its conversion into a motion picture, have been documented ad nauseum as part of the film's prolonged development cycle. As a fan of the original books, and of Moore's work in general, I was hoping for something true to the source material, and in all the ways that matter Watchmen delivers. The theatrical cut, which is the only version available as a digital copy, hits most of the fundamental points made by the books. The director's cut expands on this foundation, providing additional material that enriches the storyline, without being superfluous. Fans of the novel will enjoy the additions, while casual movie watchers might find the extended cut a bit long-winded.

The film looks and sounds beautiful on blu-ray and the included extras add value for enthusiasts, though they might not provide much of interest to the less fervent Watchmen watcher.

3577777,5,B001FB55H6,"I don't recall seeing such a disparity in the reviews of a film.  While there is a large portion of reviewers giving 4 or 5 star reviews, there are nearly as many that give 1 or 2 ratings.  After reading some of the lower rated reviews, I get the impression that most either: (1) were expecting a super-hero movie like Batman, Spiderman, Ironman, etc and/or (2) had not read the book/graphic novel or (3) didn't like the fact that there's a new version coming out around Christmas time.

For the most part, the movie actually followed the book more than any other book-to-film I can recall.  The end of the film is changed somewhat, but the result is the same (and a little more believable to me).  I actually saw the theater version first and had numerous questions, so I ordered the book.  After reading and gaining a better understanding of the characters and story-lines (especially of the original Watchmen of the 50s in the story), I then watched the ""Director's Cut.""  I must say that I liked that much better with the additional scenes.  I'm impressed by how much the characters, scenes, and direction come right out of the pages and onto the screen.  Sure, the music selection is okay at best, but everyone has such diverse tastes in music that it would be nearly impossible to please everyone.

It's not an uplifting movie by any means.  The result is not to make you feel all warm and fuzzy where the good guys win and everything is right in the world.  For me, it was more down to earth than the romanticized super-hero movies.  It just made me think more than a traditional super-hero movie.  However, it's not for everyone.  With the additional 24 minutes in the Director's Cut, the movie is nearly 3 hours long and some folks may not like the level of drama that builds and unfolds.  Some may call it boring, but I quite enjoyed it.  Certainly not suitable for kids, hence the R rating.  There is some graphic violence and a little nudity.

Overall, a must see, but you must like this type of movie if you're going to enjoy it.  Read the other reviews to get other perspectives, there are some great ones here.  I'd also recommend reading the book first.  It jumps around quite a bit, but you'll have a better appreciation for the movie if you do.",1251849600,,2262,4.519704433497537
3577778,3,B001FB55H6,"Thanks to a string of successful comic book movie hits, directors are finally showing some respect for their original source material.  In the past, it was clear that the director's vision eclipsed any fan interest, which resulted in the Batman series kicked off by Tim Burton eventually circling the toilet bowl before being flushed by Joel Schumacher.  The tide has reversed, with fanboys-turned-directors like Peter Jackson, Robert Rodriguez, and Guillermo del Toro showing an almost slavish devotion to the source material. Zack Snyder can now add his name to that list.

Watchmen takes place in an alternate reality where the threat of weapons of mass destruction looms large, thanks in part to superheroes who range in sanction from government agents to violent outlaws. They are gods among men, these superheroes, but they are also deeply flawed human beings.  Watchmen is their story.

There's remarkably little superhero-action in Watchmen.  When you strip away all the distractions like the altered timeline and the murder mystery, it becomes clear that Watchmen is actually a character study.  The film ping-pongs between each character's backstory, slowly peeling back each layer until we get to the conclusion: that people do terrible things for good reasons. Unfortunately, some characters are fleshed out more than others.

Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), the Question-like stand-in, is the most interesting character, an anti-hero filled with the rage of moral absolutism, right at home in a repressive society. He also provides noir-style narrative throughout Watchmen.

Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), who has an uncanny resemblance to a young Chevy Chase, is basically an alternative Batman in search of a cause.  He's largely a cipher here, cast primarily as the potential love interest of Silk Spectre.

Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) provides the emotional center of the film but unfortunately doesn't do much for women's rights - she comes off as emotionally conflicted and petulant.

The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a Punisher analogue whose death at the beginning of the film provides much of the movie's structure, is also a relative unknown.  His nickname is derived from his sociopathic detachment, killing with glee.  Unfortunately, he just comes off as a murderous thug.

Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) is perfect as a mildly contemptuous superhuman, more alien and powerful than Superman. His mere existence can cause nations to go to war.  Unfortunately, the film struggles with defining the limits of his powers - I half expected Manhattan to change time and space (like Superman did in the 1978 film) to ""fix"" things.

Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), perhaps the most important character in the film, is inexplicably both the most brilliant man on earth and a supreme martial artist. There's nothing in Ozymandias' background to explain why this is.  His complete lack of development compared to the other characters is where Watchmen stumbles.

Watchmen is a really interesting take on superheroes.  Unfortunately, it is no longer revolutionary as it might have been, because the 80s comic laid the framework for serious superhero comics that came later, which in turn spawned serious superhero movies like The Dark Knight.  In other words, Watchmen might have been a genre-shaking film ten years ago.  It's less successful as an entertaining film today. It's a museum replica of comic book history, faithful to its medium and appreciated more as a reference than a movie experience.",1251763200,,3515,5.318264014466546

For starters, pay attention to the R rating- it's there for a reason. This isn't Spiderman or Iron Man. There's plenty of sex and horror-movie levels of gore.

The first 30 minutes were actually quite promising, and even at the hour mark I was holding out hope that the story might redeem itself, but after that everything just came completely off the rails. But in retrospect, I guess I should have been on alert when Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are A-Changing"" normally three minutes, had to be altered to play over the six minute opening montage, which starts the process of filling is in on the back-story. Unfortunately, that's only the beginning of this problem; the Watchmen simply has so much history to fill the viewer in on that the lengthy flashback sequences eventually bring any momentum the film had grinding to a halt. Over the course of 2 hours and 43 minutes, the narrative goes from slow to outright dull to seemingly endless. Eventually, you simply don't care what happens to any of the characters, or if the whole world goes up in a nuclear fireball. By the time it all ends, the credits almost seem like a blessing.

I read the comic book with no problem because it was the most amazing thing I ever read, such a different take on superheros, they're misfits, some of them insane, tired of people not apperciating them. I recommend to read the comic book first because if you don't, you may be extremely lost while watching this movie. The constant flashbacks in the movie kind of took away from everything, it was like watching two movies in one. But after watching it for a second time and reading over the book, I understood it a lot more and apperciated the movie because it served it purpose as an entertaining movie and had some relation to the comic book. I was suprised to see how many lines were directly from the comic book. This movie is not for everyone, it is very violent movie but if people watched this director's movie before, they should expect it. But overall, I rated this a good movie.

I am pleased with the content and quality of material on this edition, but two things bothered me.  The first thing, and the title of this review, is that the _awesome_ theatrical trailer is not here!  A trailer is included, but it is amazingly lame.  I have to go to YouTube to watch one of the best trailers I've ever seen.

I don't understand why studios don't include all the promotional material they can.  It wouldn't take up much space and it's interesting to see how some films are marketed.  However, with many films, the original trailer that made me want to see it in the first place appears no where on the film when I buy it.

The second thing that bothered me is that as soon as I opened the box, I'm confronted by a flyer for the ""Watchmen Ultimate Collector's Edition"" that's coming in December of 2009!  WTF?  I just bought _this_ edition and now there's going to be a _better_ one coming out?  If I had known, I would have waited!  I'm certainly not going to buy another copy!

3577903,4,B001FB55H6,"Watchmen (Zack Snyder, 2009)

Dear Zack,

May I still call you Zack, even after all those nasty things I said in my review of 300? I hope so, because I'm going to start out my review of Watchmen by taking them all back. I really don't hope you get eaten by wild dingoes in the middle of the night, and I have no intentions of making you into a delectable stew. Okay, 300 was still a monstrous desecration of its source material, but Watchmen is, for most of its length, as slavishly faithful as 300 was a departure. For a movie that's been in on-and-off development for almost twenty years, that was necessary, and adding in those shots that were made to look as much like the panels they were drawn from as possible was a wonderful touch. But more on this later.

For those of you who have been in a cave for twenty years, Watchmen takes place in an alternate-universe 1985 in which superheroes exist. Well, one superhero exists, Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup). The rest of the Watchmen are just regular guys who dress up and fight crime with good old-fashioned brawn and technology. At least, that is, until the Keene Act, passed a few years previous, which outlawed masked vigilantes. Dr. Manhattan was appropriated by the government, of course, for as a military asset, he's incomparable--a nuclear scientist who, through a nasty accident, has become something much more than human. With him went Silk Spectre, now known as plain ol' Sally Jupiter (27 Dresses' Malin Akerman), Doc's girlfriend. The Comedian (The Accidental Husband's Jeffrey Dean Morgan) went into retirement, as did Nite Owl (Hard Candy's Patrick Wilson), who spends his weekends drinking beers with the original Nite Owl, Hollis Mason (Stephen McHattie, recently of Pontypool), the only former masked crusader to have gone public with his identity save Adrian Veidt (Brideshead Revisited's Matthew Goode), now a captain of industry). There was one other member of the Watchmen, Rorshach (Shutter Island's Jackie Earle Hailey). Rorschach ignored the ban, and still wanders at night in his mask and gloves, fighting street crime and doing voice-overs. (Rorschach is an obvious nod to Travis Bickle, but without the cab.) Now that all the players are set up, the movie opens with someone breaking into the Comedian's apartment and killing him, and Rorschach's appearance on the scene soon after. Combined with a few other events and portents, Rorschach comes to the conclusion that someone is stalking former masked vigilantes. His former colleagues initially dismiss the idea, but a few of them come around, Meanwhile, all is not well on the home front with Laurie and Dr. Manhattan; Doc's working with Veidt on an energy source that will revolutionize life as we know it (and neutralize the Soviet threat in the process), and Laurie's feeling lonely. Meanwhile, Manhattan (whose voice bears a startling resemblance to Hal's from 2001) has the charge leveled at him that his very presence may be giving those around him cancer, leading to him rethinking his remaining on Earth. It's all part of something bigger, of course, but in order to get to the bottom of it, the former friends will have to reforge old bonds, and sever even older ones, in their respective quests for truth.

Simply put, Watchmen is one of the most dazzling visual spectacles I've ever seen, and it is so perfectly paced that it is also the fastest three hours I've ever spent watching a movie. (This is the directors' cut, natch.) I wasn't sure how much I expected from this cast, but that may have more to do with the fact that like most Watchmen fans I've been casting and recasting this thing in my head for decades. All of them do an outstanding job. Snyder's direction is the best I've seen from him, and as I said, for the most part, the adaptation is slavishly faithful to the original comic. (The bits from Hollis Mason's book are absent, as is Takes from the Black Freighter; both appeared on DVD as this hit theaters in animated form.) Of course, the big change, which involves the climax, has been the source of controversy since about ten seconds after the movie was released in theaters. Put me down with those who felt it intelligent, well-thought-out, and, if not better than the comic book's climax, as good. Simply put, I expected Watchmen to be watchable but throwaway; what I actually got surpassed my expectations in every possible way.

Oh, boy.  Liked it when he was indifferent to humanity.  Made a lot of insightful comments.  Then ends by saying that he might create some of his own, or something to that end.

Definitely worth the watch, for the intricacies. Truly, it is a layered film (and comic), and different from the usual Hollywood Factory.

Nay, on the music selection. Yuck: Dylan, Nena, Simon and Garfunk. For me, took me out of the moment.  Particularly, during the endless opening title sequence accompanied by Dylan's drone.  Dig?

Also, why go with Christian Bale's Batman voice for Rory?  Or Natalie Portman's voice dubbed for Laurie (haha).

Finally, Alan Moore-on.  What a doofus: not having his name attached to the film's credits?  Fine.  From now on, I shall attribute Watchmen to Dave Gibbons.

3577981,4,B001FB55H6,"Previous reviews for this film seem very polarised.
Certainly I agree with the widely held view that this film is best suited to comics fans, rather than the general public.
For those of us familiar with the original work of Graphic Fiction (rated by Time Magazine as one of the 100 best ever fiction novels) Watchmen provides much of what any experienced cinema-goer might expect of a well executed adaptation of a previously published work. The story is abbreviated and some story elements changed to produce a more pleasing cinematic experience, and that inevitably will have offended some purists, in the same way they were probably offended by certain story changes in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings.
The characterizations are, happily, dead-on accurate. Rorshach and Dan Dreiberg in particular. While some have criticized the acting in the film as ""wooden"", all the actors, regardless of their individual ability, manage to create believable characters that slot well into the structure of the story.
Dave Gibbons' role as on set advisor throughout the filming of Watchmen has obviously paid dividends, with the look and feel of the film evoking nicely the themes of the original Graphic Novel.

My best hints to potential viewers of this film are comparative in nature.
If you enjoy densely plotted, multi-layered suspense or noir you should check this out.
If you enjoy political satire you should check this out.
If you enjoy superhero cinema, as more than just action filled special effects romps, then you should check this out.
If you enjoy films that push or break boundaries or thematic taboos then you should check this out.
If you are a fan of modern comics and graphic novels then you should check this out.
Everyone else needs to be advised that this is a big, densely plotted and slow paced examination of the principle's of good and evil within our society, mirrored in the rag-tag collection of miscreants that populate the ""super"" group depicted in this film. Please note they may each be ""super"", but not necessarily a ""hero""!

If you are looking for a light-hearted,smash-bang special effects laden action-fest then I suggest you look for it elsewhere. This film's themes are darker, and nastier, than most people expect and it can be a dreadful shock to the system for any dull-witted members of the ""fluffy bunny brigade"" that accidentally encounter it.

This is an adult drama/suspense/action genre-bender of a film.
Without wanting to sound stuck-up, unless you have enough smarts and sophistication to want to see cinema that can challenge as well as entertain, then you should probably stay away from this title. Apologies if this sounds snooty.

The number of non-sensical one-star negative reviews I am seeing for this film, from viewers whose chief problem with the film appears to be that there were not enough action sequences, is both disheartening and bewildering. There is even one guy who didn't understand the film and wants it cut to an hour and a half. Unbelievable. If he didn't understand the film with all the masses of exposition that it contained then how on earth does he hope to understand it any better with half the movie left on the cutting room floor? A one-star review for a film because you came home from work tired and couldn't stay awake while watching an epic? COME ON! The film-makers may be responsible for producing a work you don't understand, but they are not responsible for your sleep-deprivation.

I personally dug the book and I like what they have done with the film adaptation.

This joins the top echelon of film adaptations of comicbook properties. Watchmen is greater than the sum of its parts, just like Road to Perdition, Ghost World and Iron Man.

What if the Justice League of America (the JLA) of comic book fame had been composed of a bunch of psychopaths instead of protectors of goodness, truth, justice, and the ""American way""?  What if they were a bunch of psycho-babbling, pathological, fascist criminals instead, the Unjust League of Fascists (the ULF)?  What if Ayn Rand goose-stepping nutcakes wrote the series instead of writers and illustrators with talent?  Well, wonder no more, because here is your answer wrapped in state of the art special effects and premium quality Dolby surround sound.

The Watchmen are a bunch of confused and confusing apathetic psychopaths whose complete lack of decency and empathy (hence the word ""psychopath"") result in their taking up of causes that provide the greatest return on investment, to themselves, sort of like a crime crew with capes.  They differ in their degree of pathology, with the two most ""super"" being the most pathological of the pathetic crew.  Of the two sickest psychopaths, ""Dr. Manhattan"" is the most irritating of the bunch.  Like the much more likable Incredible Hulk, Manhattan was transmutated by his close proximity to radioactivity, only the radiation somehow combined with his warped view of physics and geek physique to produce a radioactive, arrogant, obnoxious, condescending, expressionless, pseudo-science and psychobabble spouting version of the Nazi's ubermensche; a superman that glows in the dark and who can frustrate and bore you to death with his delusional irrationality, which he and the dimwitted around him mistake for profundity.  He wanders around nude, or semi-nude, because he apparently works out and takes radioactive roids when not honoring others with his super presence, and wants everyone to see the results (see ""arrogance"" above).

The movie tries to convince us that its two ubermensches with the uber-mostiest commit their various atrocities because their superior intellect allows them to see the bigger picture, while the rest of us are limited to our small-screen view and mistakenly see crimes against humanity instead.  This is basically the same defense given by all criminal psychopaths suffering from empathy-free delusions of grandeur, and falls flat on its Dr. Manhattan-like expressionless face here, too.

I dunno - maybe it doesn't help that I never read the comic book (excuse me, ""graphic novel""). I wonder if this is what it was like for outsiders to watch 'Lord of the Rings'? In which, for me, it was ultra-cool to all my favorite characters come to life, and I loved every entrance and how faithful it was to the book; I was just overwhelmed.

3578194,5,B001FB55H6,"Watchmen is without a doubt the greatest comic book adaptation ever done. One thing I appreciate is the fact that the movie so closely follows the graphic novel. Very little is changed during the film adaptation, and what is does not take away from the story at all. You really have to watch the movie more than once in order to appreciate the attention to detail given. You will see so many parallels to our 1985 with the Watchmen storyline intertwined. One example is before Laurie and Dan fight the gang off you can see on the wall of the alley posters advertising famine aid for Africa. Difference being it has Veidt's picture on it as opposed to celebrities of our era. Little things like that, which the average viewer may not even notice, are prevalent throughout the movie. The soundtrack is incredible and I especially love the opening credits where the history of the Minutemen and later the Watchmen are shown intertwined with actual history, like the first Silk Specter painted on the side of a B-17 bomber during WWII in the same vein as Betty Grable.

It's really no surprise that viewers are torn over the movie. I believe a lot of the bad reviews stem from people who have never read the graphic novel and maybe do not understand the concept of the story. Personally I don't read comic books, but I did read Watchmen just before the movie came out. Make no mistake; this is a movie you have to pay close attention to in order to fully appreciate it because the story is so deep. Some criticize it, saying parts of it are a political ploy, particularly the scene where Veidt is arguing with the oil and coal industries over clean, renewable energy. Fact is; this is straight from the book, which was written in 1985. The argument over fossil fuels and renewable energy is nothing new.

I think another reason for viewers feeling torn is not only is it extremely graphic (and definitely not something for kids to watch), it shatters the mold of every superhero stereotype out there. This is definitely NOT a ""feel good"" movie like Spiderman. Instead it makes you feel like what it would be like if super heroes actually existed, thereby making the story more believable. The characters are very much flawed, especially Blake the Comedian. Some of his actions are downright evil, and yet he is supposed to be one of the good guys. The paradoxes jump out and smack you across the face. Spiderman's so-called ""dark side"" becomes completely laughable when compared to Blake or Rorschach. What we find is that super heroes are indeed human and flawed like the rest of us...even Dr. Manhattan (though he is the only one with true super powers), for as time progresses he becomes more detached and nihilistic.

The added scenes to the Director's Cut have been covered, so I won't address those again here. Suffice it to say, they add more depth to the story and clarify things that those who saw the theatrical version without having read the book would find puzzling.

There will always be two groups of people with strong feelings about Watchmen. You will either love it or hate it, and it's unlikely that one side can ever convince the other otherwise. You can count me in the former category, as I feel this movie, and indeed the graphic novel, are timeless and deep in their story-telling. The messages of Watchmen are just as relevant today as they were in 1985, and probably always will be. Given the attention to detail and how closely the movie follows the book, the ""unfilmable"" graphic novel has indeed been filmed and to the highest standards.",1250640000,3,3562,4.676236044657097
3578195,1,B001FB55H6,"I want to say first and foremost I don't care about the comic book or how good it was. I'm grown and don't read comics and haven't done so in over 13 years. I do however watch movies, and that's what my review will be based off of. If you feel the need to comment about how wrong my I am, and how everyone should enjoy this piece of work feel free to do so, but be warned I will completely destroy you, and embarrass you, and leave the remains of your ignorance displayed for all of Amazon to see!

With that said I shall start my review.

First off I just want to say that this movie was probably the worse over budgeted movie I have seen in a very very very long time. I have nothing against Zack Snyder he is a brilliant silver screen genius. However, this movie should have never been created. This movie was an absolute disappointment. I sat there for 162minutes wanting to turn this movie off, but continued to watch just hoping that some how it would redeem itself, and make the money I spent renting this trash worth my while. unfortunately that moment never came at all.

This movie is an embarrassment to any and every superhero movie that has ever been created. It's a slap in the face to the entire comic industry. This movie takes the idea that so many creators, artist, writers, directors, etc. have fought for over the past century and completely demolishes it. This isn't about a group of hero's that put aside their own personal problems to help humanity, it's about a group of fallen hero's that have been tarnished by humanity, and after seeing so much they now decide that they want to play God, and steer the fates of the people that they once walked side by side with. These heroes are nothing like heroes at all, matter of fact they don't even fit the profile of an anti-hero. They are highly flawed self indulgent human beings, who criticize the very same people they protect, and although they are the heroes, they are so tarnished that they can play the villains as well.

Why do I hate this movie? Because it destroys what a super hero is, it destroys the nobility and morality that super heroes base their lives upon. You can't even tell who is good or bad in this film, it's just that one side wears masks, and the other doesn't. These hero's never hesitate to take life (whether innocent or not), they don't think twice about adultery, and they don't worry about putting people in danger. I mean what is the point of bothering with trying to pretend to be on the side of the righteous if your just as crooked as the people your catching?

Another thing that bites my rear is that this movie goes everywhere but ends up absolutely no where. It tries to have some deep underlying meaning, but it takes 3 hours to get it across, and by the time it does your to appalled by everything you've just seen to even appreciate what message they were trying to convey. This film is absolutely terrible, and I sincerely mean that. There's raunchy sex scene after sex scene and it serves no purpose. It really only deteriorates the film. It's so hard to explain the plot of this story as well, because it branches off into too many different angles, and absolutely none of them are interesting.

 To sum it up all you basically learn is that each character has a troubled past that turned them into the demented superhero/villain that you see them as today. This marred from over 3 hours of unnecessary sex scenes, overly violent gore scenes, pointless violence, and very ""flat"" monotone acting. It's very hard to find one likeable character in this film as they all are equally unlikable aside from the narrator who needed a throat lozenger, there's absolutely no one to root for.

 I honestly didn't care what happened to any of the characters in this film because there was no connection to any of them. They all hated themselves, and damned the human race (yet ironically wanted to save it?). There is absolutely no point to this film! If you can some how scramble some deep meaning from ""Watchmen"" that makes it a remarkable masterpiece to be saved for the ages, then please do share it will all of us here at Amazon reviews. Because, in the 3 hours I spent watching this unsatisfying garbage it surely was missed. This is the first time I actually felt angered after watching a movie. Angered I wasted my money to buy it, and angered I wasted time off my life to watch it.

If anything can be learned from watchmen it's that big budget will attract big publicity, and that will lead to big sales. This ""gem"" of a move WILL be forgotten, and it WILL not be remembered just like plenty of other big budget movies that people barley mention today (ID4 anyone?Armagedon?Fantastic Four? Hulk?etc. etc.) I can't wait to forget that I watched this film, but I will remember to never watch it again. Thank God I rented instead of purchased because had that been I would of mailed it to Warner Bros. with a note that said ""Keep it"".

This film has a 1 star rating from me. However, you can subtract that star. I don't give this film any rating at all. This isn't a movie, it's an experiment. It's an experiment to see just what type of bull people are willing to sit through and endure. By the end of the film I was wishing Mr. Mahatten had actually nuked me instead just to save me from watching the rest of this film.

Garbage... beyond words.",1250553600,16,5359,4.457142857142857
3578196,5,B001FB55H6,"This movie was awesome. I loved the whole movie. The acting was great. I really enjoyed the flow of the film. It really kept you guessing. Because it's kinda like a mystery investigation for most of the movie. But what I liked most was the soul and mythology of the film. The movie didn't sugar coat anything. And in this genre everything gets sugar coated. Because movies have to appeal to a grandmother, teenager, male and female.

I have not read the watchman graphic novel but at least as a movie it was great. I highly recommend this for anyone that wants something raw and not dummied down. It was very refreshing.

I can say this movie was one of the best movies in the last decade. and in my top 10 overall.

3578197,5,B001FB55H6,"I had no history with the Watchmen comics, so I expected to be lost.  Now I can't say I picked everything up through the first watching, but I wasn't lost.  Repeated watchings helped clarify some things and only made it richer.  The features--particularly the ""in movie commentary"" feature--are pretty good.

But I'm here to talk about the MOVIE.  Some have bashed the packaging, claiming there's a 45-disc uber-geek box set coming out for Christmaas that EVERYONE should buy.  Look, this movie was already pretty long.  I don't need the ""definitive"" version and I don't care about the ship story or whatever.

The bottom line is, this was even better than The Dark Knight.  The cinematography, the music, the STORY . . I loved it.  It came out of nowhere and blew me away.  I knew I was going to love it right from the credits.

The ending was very poetic and moving--I was genuinely affected by Rorschack's fate.  It's not a movie that leaves you with easy answers.  It's conflicted, in a way that The Dark Knight was conflicted, even more so.

It is certainly long and measured and doesn't really get ""going"" with the plot for a couple of hours.  A lot of it is just backstory and flashback to fill out the characters.  But the movie is stunningly beautiful and I think we have a great new director here.",1250553600,2,1307,4.588744588744588

3578309,3,B001FB55H6,"Okay, I will admit, I never really read the Watchmen comic book. My roommate has it and while it has been in my hands I have only merely thumbed through it. So needless to say I wasn't entirely sure what to expect...I often think that no expectations are better than low or high. My other room was hard up for a movie night so we ran out and got this film. About twenty minutes into it I was so bored I wanted to cry. To do this review just I feel its only fair to break it down into two parts.

WOW FACTOR:
Was awesome, the design and delivery of this film was brilliant. I love the stylized look and feel of the film and you really get into characters lives (albeit sometimes to much). I am a huge fan of any film that bring the pages of a comic book to life and not turn it into a Hollywood orgy. I am a big fan of Patrick Wilson so I enjoyed watching him once again play a quirky character (he's kinda like a male Mary-Louise Parker).

Overall Story:
I think I fell asleep at least twice..okay not really. But my roomie was snoozing through part of it. She doesn't appreciate the gravity of design so she was bored the whole way through. My other roomie who is a fan of the comic book commented how much like the book the movie so maybe I just don't get this style of story telling.

Will I immediately be selling my copy of the film?  No, while it was a snooze fest I think the art direction (and Wilson) of the film makes it at least a keeper for the collection to pull out on those inevitable two day Oklahoma blizzards where the world shuts down for 48 hours.

Hope this helps.",1250553600,,1585,4.1
3578310,5,B001FB55H6,"When this movie originally was released in theatres, I decided to wait until the actual director's cut came out. Mainly because I wanted to get the fully idealized version of the film, and because I wanted to avoid all the Watchmen review civil wars that were going on at the time.

Anyway so as for the movie itself, this is based on Alan Moore's groundbreaking comic book maxi-series from the 80s(everyone forgets it was a comic 1ST and a graphic novel 2ND!). Moore wanted nothing to do with it, because he's had a bear up his butt ever since the last couple of movie fiascos based on his works(Constantine, From Hell, League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen). But Zack Snyder came along and made this sucker work. For the longest time, the project was plagued with doubt because no one really had any faith that it could be made into a coherent story. The mature nature of The Dark Knight helped cement the idea that not all superhero movies need to be corny action flicks

The story is set in an alternate history during 1985. Nixon is STILL President, and Congress has put a ban on superheroes. The Comedian, a former hero from a group called Watchmen, is mysteriosly murdered. Rorschach, the only active hero, sets out to find his killer. What follows is a look into the background of all these now-retired heroes. Nite-Owl is dreaming of his glory days, Silk Spectre tries to live a life away from her mother while comforting Dr. Manhattan(the only one with powers), and Ozymandias is creating a new type of energy source with his vast fortune. However, Rorschach gets framed for killing an ex-villain. Nite-Owl hooks up with Silk Spectre, and frees Rorschach, while Dr. Manhattan is cooling off on Mars because he is blamed for giving his former friends cancer. It turns out the entire thing was a plot by Ozymandias set to stop the nations of the world from going into nuclear war. A final confrontation between the remaning heroes results in them going along with Ozymandias' idea, despite all the deaths it caused, except for Rorscach who ends up as snow pizza.

Despite all the fanboy gripe that this movie got, there was an equal amount of praise for it. Most people's expectations got a little to high though, thinking that a Rated-R superhero movie would stay in the #1 spot for very long, which is unfortunate because that's how ALOT of jerks are going to insist on looking at it years from now. I thought the film as a whole captured all the important aspects of the original story, at least alot better than some other comic-based movies. This new Director's Cut brings some additional footage that was left out of the theatrical edition which adds more clarity to the plot, plus some scenes that weren't included at all like the death of the original Nite-Owl. I'd recommend getting this, BIGTIME.",1250553600,2,2810,4.718940936863544

3578314,5,B001FB55H6,"and by that I'm not referring to the ""Tales of The Black Freighter"" segment. First let me tell you about the film and some of the reasons why some people didn't like it.

Although I'm a huge fan of the Donner Superman films, which I still consider the best superhero incarnation to date, I have to say that Watchmen is the first time I've had the sensation of watching a comic book come to life. It really feels like reading the comics. The photography is simply brilliant. All the small changes made by the director felt right and in no way disrespects the original material. If anything they enhance it.

As for the negative reviews, I believe one of the reasons that some people didn't like the film is because those unfamiliar with the story are expecting to watch a superhero movie, and Watchmen id definitely NOT a superhero story, it's a story WITH superheroes.

Others complain that it doesn't have enough action, maybe because people are becoming too accustomed to the recent movie mentality that all a good movie needs is a basic plot and a lot of explosions, where it's the plot that serves the action and not the other way around. Well, Watchmen is a not that at all. If anything it's a philosophical questioning of society and its moral values, analyzed through the different perspectives of each character. It's about choosing between what's right and what's easy. It's about being who you are or who the rest of the world expects you to be. It's about humanity.

Is it perfect? Well, last time I checked nothing was. I personally have two minor observations.

The first one regards the length of the film. Not that I think it's too long, I think it's too short. As I've mentioned before, people nowadays are not accustomed to complex long stories in a single film, they need at least a trilogy to digest them. I must admit that even I sometimes got a little tired during the film due to its complexity, so I imagine how people unfamiliar with the story should have felt. I believe that instead of a movie Watchmen should have been made as a miniseries (just like the original comics) which would have given people more time to process and truly enjoy the story, not to mention deeper character development and more flashbacks (personally I would really like to see more of the original minutemen back story).

My other observation is about the casting, and I add that this is based solely on my personal conception of these characters, so feel free to disagree.

Almost all the major players were perfect incarnations of the graphic novel/miniseries, so I will only comment on two:

The first was Matthew Goode as Adrian Veidt. Although I think his performance was competent he wasn't physically as similar to the original character as the other actors were which was a noticeable contrast, not to mention the inherent aura of nobility the character possesses that I didn't see in him.

The second, and I know some will disagree so let me start by saying that I'm a great admirer of his work, was Jeffrey Dean Morgan, not because he wasn't good, but I really don't think he got the character right. Although physically he was almost identical to the original character I thought their take on it was a bit off, and when I say ""their take"" I mean the director's as well. In the comics, I thought The Comedian had a powerful presence every time he appeared, but I didn't feel that in the movie.

The fact is: The Comedian (from the acting standpoint) is perhaps the most difficult character to play on Watchmen, because most of the characters' personalities are black and white, you know where they stand, whereas the Comedian exists in the gray area of morality, never really explaining if the character is really a psychopath living in a normal world, or if he he's in fact the only sane man who can see the madness the world is, and unlike ""normal"" people who refuse to see it, he just surrenders to it (That would be a real joke, wouldn't it?). Anyway, that's the charm of the character. To perfectly develop a character like this, in the very short exposition time he's given during the film, requires a very precise touch both from the actor and from the director, and personally I don't think they really nailed it. It wasn't bad, not at all, mind you. It simply wasn't right.

Other than that, it was a great story made into a great film.

One tip: try to watch the mockumentaty ""Under the Hood"" (not included here) BEFORE you watch this film, and if you can, wait until the end of the year when the ultimate edition will be released with ""Tales of The Black Freighter"" cartoon woven into the movie, for I believe it will be a much richer experience.",1250467200,,4671,4.600961538461538

3578330,5,B001FB55H6,"I certainly enjoy the simple good guy vs. bad guy, black and white type of comic book story; but this isn't that kind of story, and thank god. Why would anyone want to see the same story over and over? Moore's Watchmen is considered, by many people, to be the greatest comic ever made. It has been compared to the best of literature and ranked as one of Time's 100 greatest novels of all time (not just graphic). The movie tells the story of the comic almost perfectly; so whatever objections one would have to the movie you would have for the comic as well. The only difference between the two, is the medium, which, in cinematic form, does not give the viewer much of a chance to think about the plot. The plot is, for that matter, deeply deeply textured, and could be discussed, like any true work of art, for a lifetime. To put it in very simple terms, Moore's Watchman conceives of superheroes or super powered people with all of the moral quandaries every human being must face, except for the fact that these superheroes are not limited by the physical constraints of mortals. Which begs the question, if there truly was a Superman, just how moral would he be? How ethical can any of us be, when we can choose to act without consequence? Or in the case of Batman, how tightly would he cling to his beliefs in not killing, when faced with homicidal child killers? Would he allow a murderer to go to prison, knowing he would be freed to kill again? If the judicial system is broken, how should superheroes react? If Superman could stop the end of the world by killing innocents, should he? It is, for sure, a thinking man's movie, and an adult movie. But it can be a difficult film to stomach, and the ending will most definitely challenge people's ideas of what's right and wrong. But, like any good work of art, it challenges us to think and even to argue it. In Watchmen we are not spoon fed what we want, necessarily, but maybe what, in this troubled time of questionable ethics, what we need.

Some people have criticised Zack Snyder for tampering with the ending, but I say give the guy a break, the overwhelming majority of scenes in this film are a slavish recreation of the original grpahic novel, and frankly, I thought Alan Moore's original ending was always somewhat risible and would not have translated well to the big screen. I actually preferred this ending. I only wish Snyder had tampered a little more with the source material, as I felt at every step I was simply having the graphic novel read back at me.  Loved the portrayal of Rorschach - perfectly realised performance all round.  Also thought the Comedian was well done, and Billy Crudup did manage to capture some of the other worldliness of Dr Manhattan.

3578389,1,B001FB55H6,"I hated this movie.

Look at all the positive reviews and see if you can find what it is exactly about this movie those people liked. Do they mention the plot or the message or the theme or the symbolism and how this movie seems parallel today's political/social conflicts? NO! They say it compliments the graphic novel? Ooooooh! So did the Howard the Duck and the TMNT movies! Was I supposed to be intrigued by the big blue penis, or the superhero raping the other hero, or the two heroes getting after it in the owl-a-copter, or the two twisted heroes murdering other heroes? I guess I could say I have never seen that in a superhero movie before. I'm so dissappointed and somebody owes me 3.5 hours of my life back.

I rank the suck of this movie right up there with...well no Watchmen takes sucking to a whole new super level. This movie was a really bad superhero movie. Look, here is the ""secret"" superhero movie formula: Good superpowered guys kick the crap out of bad superpowered guys...period. This movie was trying very hard to be complicated and clever like Matrix part 3. Don't show this to your kids. They'll grow up hating you and superheroes.

The best parts of this movie are what you see in the 3-minute trailers. I'm a huge comic book fan...I have never read this grafic novel and now I never will. If I want to see crooked people getting over on the world and confusion about who is truely good or really evil, then I will tune in to CSPAN.

I was expecting a superhero movie not a superhero soap opera. AND what exactly was super about these characters. They are the opposite of saaaaay the Fantastic Four, which knew how to laugh at itself, I think. Also...the Dark Knight was long, beautiful, and intelligent, but still a little dark and still you are better off for having seen it. Watchmen is just a 3.5 hour long train wreck that you would be better off if you had never seen it.

The potential for this movie is that it makes me not want to see another hollywood superhero movie ever. Of all the potential superhero stories left to bring to the big screen how in the world did DC get this in front of me before I saw Wonderwoman, Flash, JLA, Thor, Capt America, or a good Superman movie for that matter? Oh yeah...that's right...Howard the Duck made it to the big screan too.

Last 2 things...there are Saturday morning superhero episodes that are better than this movie...check out Starcrossed. Finally, I didn't have to pre-read the Matrix, or Star Wars, or Terminator to love those movies. All the pre-reading in the world wouldn't help Howard the Duck.  Oh by the way...Mystery Men is a GREAT superhero movie in comparison to this Watchmen tripe. Remember the Sphinx? ""He who questions training only trains himself at asking questions.""

3578391,4,B001FB55H6,"I hadn't heard of ""The Watchmen"" graphic novel before seeing this film and although my interest was piqued by the trailers, I wasn't able to catch the movie during its theatrical release. Having just purchased a Blu-Ray player, ""The Watchmen"" turned out to be the first Blu-Ray movie I rented and I was really anxious to see it. I have to admit, my first viewing of the film left me pretty befuddled. It was extremely long (this was, of course, the ""director's cut"") and the story was not at all what I had expected. Although the film was visually stunning, I had a really hard time finding a way to care about the characters that populated the Watchmen world. None of them were particularly like-able and some were downright despicable. Unfamiliar with the story, I found myself scratching my head when it was all over and wondering what the point of the whole thing was.

Seeing ""The Watchmen"" reminded me of the first time I saw ""The Lord of the Rings."" I'd never read Tolkien's books and had no clue what the story was about. I gave up on the film about 30 minutes in. I didn't understand the extremely complex story and couldn't comprehend the almost Shakespearean dialogue and terminology. My daughter recommended watching the film with the subtitles on, and in this way I was finally able to follow the story and learn my way around Tolkien's world. I also became a diehard fan of both the films and the books. I certainly don't think that ""The Watchmen"" in any way compares to Tolkien in terms of the breadth and depth of its story and characters. But it was compelling enough for me to give it another try and I have to admit that ""The Watchmen"" grew on me.

Despite lackluster performances from some of the cast, the story itself is what carries the day...a frank and unvarnished exploration of the less-than-heroic side of masked heroes and the social/philosophical implications of a society that embraces vigilantism. All of the characters have a back-story, some of them more interesting than others. The glue that seems to hold the whole thing together is the fascinating anti-hero, Rorschach, played by thoroughly committed comeback kid, Jackie Earle Haley. In both masked and unmasked form, Rorschach commands a morbidly fascinating persona and whenever he is on the screen you cannot help but look at him. He continuously moves the story forward, taking us into ever darker places with his uncompromising persistence. Considering that he was a character with so few redeeming qualities, I was surprisingly sad to see Rorschach reduced to a gory smear in the snow in the last minutes of the film. In the end, one is left with unanswered questions about personal motivation and whether ends really do justify means. Be forewarned, there is absolutely nothing uplifting about this film. Are any of the characters really ""heroes?"" You will have to decide for yourself.

Watching the film a second time also helped me to appreciate some of its more subtle attributes...the amazing complexity of the CGI effects, from the tiny electrical undulations beneath Dr. Manhattan's skin, to Rorschach's mesmerizing mask...the humor, sometimes very understated (a constantly malfunctioning flashlight). I can understand the sentiments of those put off by the VERY graphic violence and the film's single (almost superfluous)  sex scene. But this is not a movie for kids, nor is it a typical superhero romp. ""Watchmen"" pulls no punches in exposing the flaws of all the main characters, so it's a challenge to find anyone to root for. Perhaps that's the point...that life is rarely as simple as right and wrong, good and bad, black and white.

So, who watches the Watchmen? Hurm....",1250035200,5,3681,4.902086677367576
3578392,1,B001FB55H6,"Watchmen is an incredibly sloshed piece of work.  Maybe it's just me, but picking up the superhero shtick in the 80s was a mistake.  It leaves you with nothing to build a plot around except turmoil and pain.  Originally comic book heroes came to life to bring people out of their daily problems.  In the 1980s things changed and not only were they so weak they could not lift us out of our mournful existence, but heaped upon us their own set of horrors, anxieties and depressions.  The whole idea behind superheros was discarded.  Watchmen is a prime example of this, only the producers and directors actually found ways to make it worse.  Sure they added the sex in there, which wasn't necessary, but they had a real difficult time telling the story.  It comes off like a comic book that had been torn apart and pieced together by some madman.  The premise I suppose offered some hope, but the movie actually was terrible.  If you can go out and watch the grass grow, do it. It'll be more fulfilling.

The Watchmen is an evenly paced epic that is surely not for everyone.  It has its minor flaws but it is still an outstanding achievement.

To briefly summarize, the film takes place at a time that would be Richard Nixon's fifth term in office.  It is literally a setting that considers what might happen if superheroes were actual and had a major impact on our reality.  For example, Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), a naked blue omnipotent character, changes the results of our country's war in Vietnam.  A lot changes, so that is just one example.  Other characters include; the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), an elder Watchmen that has serious ethical issues; Silk Spectre II (Malin Ackerman), the daughter of a previous hero; Night Owl II (Patrick Wilson), a more virtuous hero with gadgets reminiscent of Batman; Rorsharch (Jackie Earle Haley), a masked vigilante outlaw type; and Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), a seemingly effeminate yet nearly invincible capitalist.

I actually waited for the performances to be a bit of a disappointment, but they were not nearly as bad I had heard and expected from seeing how other actors perform within a Snyder film.  In fact, Haley's role as Rorsharch was actually exceptional.  He had a tremendous presence and seemed to know the character more deeply than his cast-mates.  It most likely helped of course that his character is more intense and tragic than the others.  On the flip side, Ackerman was flat more often than not, but she looked great.  Crudup can't be blamed as his character is no longer human.  Morgan was also great as the Comedian but I'll confess that I was not aware that he wasn't Robert Downey Jr. until after I watched the movie.  My other minor complaints would be the make-up used to age some of the characters like Silk Spectre I (Carla Gugino) and Richard Nixon (Robert Wisden) and that Phobos and Deimos would not appear the way they do on the Martian landscape like they do here.  That last one is admittedly a really silly nitpicking.

There are many positive things to say about the visual effects but that should be pretty obvious just from the commercials.  The story is a hugely creative one and even when watered down for the screen it still serves as the film's strongest point by far.  It is more than enough to provoke some deeper thinking than other films within this sub-genre, but the pace of the story almost made me hope for a mini-series on Showtime or HBO at first.  In the end I had no problem with the slower scenes, but I know that some viewers did and will.  Still, Snyder and company make the film work well enough to give it a strong recommendation.",1250035200,,4108,5.819699499165275

I absolutely love comic-based movies and superhero movies and big-budget movies, but I parted with this blu-ray (which is an excellent transfer, by the way).",1249948800,3,594,4.5607476635514015
3578396,1,B001FB55H6,"I hate, hate, HATED this movie.  I hadn't seen it until I obtained the Blu-ray.  I have never read the comic, though I have heard from those who have and many of them are not all that taken with this adaptation.

The characters are dull and unremarkable as are the ""action"" scenes.  The song cues are oh-so-pretentious and uninspired.  To make matters worse, this Blu-ray release is the three-hour ""director's cut"" and it goes on FOREVER.  The shorter theatrical cut should have been included in this disc set because it must certainly be an improvement (or at lease more merciful).

I cannot recommend this movie to anyone except perhaps to someone I dislike.  When one takes into account the wealth of well-produced superhero movies available for viewing, this thing is just a huge waste of time.  I'm not being facetious when I say I would honestly rather sit through ""Elektra"" again instead of this dud.

Zack Snyder is an offense to the art of motion pictures.  Like Michael Bay, he seems to think it's acceptable to make a movie that is little more than a glorified TV commercial.

I'm not one who slams popular movies on the internet with the intention of causing a ruckus.  This movie is just so monumentally bad that I can't even keep it in my collection, which already has its share of ""questionable"" entertainment.

To end on an up-note and give credit where it's due, I thought Patrick Wilson was quite good, as was Jackie Earle Haley.  For those of us who are Kelly Leak fans, Mr. Haley's recent screen resurgence is a delight.  Lamentably, his performance is sabotaged by that same dumb ""scary"" voice effect that took ""The Dark Knight"" down a few notches and ruined Tim Roth's performance in ""Planet of The Apes"".  Will someone please explain to these Hollywood [...] that such vocal effects are distracting and most certainly not an improvement?!",1249948800,29,1861,4.765625
3578397,4,B001FB55H6,"Hey look, a review by someone who actually owns and has viewed the Blu-Ray!

The Film:

Declared ""unfilmable"" by many, ""Watcmen"" comes to us directed by Zack Snyder (director of the equally faithful but truly horrendously bad ""300""), who seems determine to say ""oh yeah? I'll film every stinking panel!"" Does this make for a good movie? Hmm. Yes and no. This film has many fine qualities, but it also has some fatal flaws.

Among its fine qualities are a wonderful visual sensibility, which aptly recreates the comic book while also maintaining a mostly realistic aesthetic which only rarely inspires giggles. Many of the performances as well are good, especially those of Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), and Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup). Wilson in particular stands out, he radiates a naive and goofy charm, and hopefully this is a star-making performance for him. In fact, I didn't find any casting decision to be a bad one, even though some have written that Malin Ackerman was a bit wooden as Silk Spectre II. I disagree. Everyone really delivered in terms of taking the material seriously and delivering a performance that matched the flavor of the comic. Popular music is used to great effect as a backdrop for the action. A very complicated story is presented in a coherent manner that most any movie-goer can grasp onto.

Fatal flaws include:
-Its enormous, bloated length. My attention really started to flag during some of the longer fight scenes.
-Conversely, length was an issue in the other way as well. Because a 12 chapter novel has been condensed into three hours, a lot of character development is lost. It becomes hard to care about some of the characters because of the relative short shrift they are given. I think the story would have been better suited to a 12-part miniseries on television, giving the characters time to breathe.
-The literal nature of the movie adaptation is a problem for someone who has read the book several times. It's not exciting and thrilling as a plot goes, it's merely an exercise of thinking ""huh, they got that in there, cool.""
-Conversely, the literal nature takes a weird vacation in the ending, in which the space monster is replaced with something that the writers and producers of the film must have felt was more ""Realistic,"" but actually turns out to be less believable in terms of the world depicted.
-The violence came off as over-the top at times. After about the ninth or tenth long, languorous shot of a severed limb with blood raining down, it just becomes boring, if not a tad annoying.

In the end, it's a good comic book movie. It has a lot to offer. It doesn't have the emotional coherence of a film like ""Dark Knight,"" probably because it tries to shoehorn 10 times the story into nearly the same running time. It's a nice thing to own if you're a fan of the book. If you're not, you might come out of viewing this scratching your head.

The Blu-Ray:

The Director's Cut gives us about a half hour more footage than the theatrical cut, though not the ""Black Freighter"" footage that will be integrated for the Christmas edition this year. Frankly, I'm glad this was left out - I found it to be kind of a drag while reading (yes, i get it, we're all depraved and will turn into cannibals if the stuff hits the fan), and it would have made an oppressive film length even more onerous.

Picture quality is very good. The film is quite dark and shadow laden, with an extremely stylized color palate, loaded with blues, greens and yelllows. Thus, it is not perhaps the most impressive ""realistic"" HD presentation you'll ever see. But it does the job, and presents the film without any real artifacts or jagged edges, and film grain is present but not obtrusive. A lot of fine detail is evident in cloth and faces, as long as you have your gamma and brightness properly set.

Audio is given to us in a VERY aggressive DTS HD mix, too aggressive for my tastes. I really do not like it when I have to adjust volume constantly on the fly, when giant explosions threaten to blow out speakers after quiet dialogue has been turned up. I'm sure this will please some, though. I just prefer a more level mix.

Extras are presented in 1080p (with subtitles, a very nice touch) on a second disc. They include a 28-minute documentary about the comic, a 26-minute piece about the psychology of vigilantism, and a 16-minute spot about the technology of the Watchmen world. All are good, with the first probably being the best. I might have liked them all better if they had been integrated into one documentary.

The main disc contains ""Maximum Movie Mode,"" a video commentary with Director Zack Snyder. This includes timeline graphics, still galleries, comic comparisons, and so on, all presented real time with the film. The film will play as usual, but then a graphic will pop up or the film ""screen"" will fall back and reveal Snyder and another ""screen"" of comparison or behind the scenes photos. It's pretty neat, but I kind of miss the more traditional style of commentary.

********

In summary, I've given this presentation of the film 4 stars. The material itself is problematic but of inarguable quality and dedication. It was obviously a labor of love. The 3 disc Blu-Ray is a very good presentation of the film, with an in-depth graphical commentary, some good documentaries, and the obligatory digital copy disc for your iPod or laptop. Those who want the additional ""Pirate Comic"" material would be best served by waiting for the more complete edition this Christmas. Personally, I'm happy to keep that located entirely within my paper copy of the book.

If you're a fan of the book, this is an easy recommendation. You'll enjoy it and there are many layers to explore. If you're not already a fan, though, this is a cautionary recommendation. This is not the greatest comic book movie ever made, nor is it even a particularly great film *as* a film. It's too long to enjoy in one sitting, too short to do the story and characterization justice, and the story just doesn't ""breathe"" in the same way that sitting down to really read a digest the graphic novel does.

It's a pretty good action movie. It's a pretty good alternate historical sci-fi story. It's a pretty good adaptation. Maybe, with something so momentous and difficult, ""pretty good"" is good enough.",1249948800,2,6357,4.724729241877256

It's certainly a surprisingly bold and original mixture of adult themed drama and superhero milieu to come from a modern day risk-averse Hollywood - but does it work?
Creating a complex alternate timeline set in the mid 80's, where superheroes exist and Nixon is still in power having won Vietnam, we are presented with a world where the cold war is leading inexorably to doomsday and the American dream has soured.  The Minutemen, a group of vigilantes originally formed in the 40's, who donned costumes and kept superfit to deal with crime, have been disbanded as their methods are called into question.  Now one of their number, the Comedian, has been slain, and gradually the remaining Minutemen must start talking together and rediscover old alliances to save the world as it teeters on the edge of extermination.  Of course, that's only the barest bones of what is going on.  What actually IS going on and what it all means will doubtless be the topic of many fevered post movie discussions.. whether you love it or loathe it, you'll almost certainly be talking about it - and is that not what the best directors really want?
The movie is full of conflicted characters with authentically grimy backstories and motivations... in juxtaposition with the graphic novel stylisations and God-complexes.  For the most part the costumed heroes are only too human - not just noble heroic human, but flawed with an ugly side human.  Did Batman appeal for having a hero who had no superpower, and bruised and bled after fights..?  Well, maybe this will appeal.  On the other hand, the God complex issue comes to the fore with Dr. Manhatten - an ordinary man exposed to a freak accident which gave him superhuman powers to defy time and manipulate matter.  Fascinatingly, as the other characters portray human foibles and issues, this character through his dissociation with our reality make him no less human in terms of being able to be manipulated, while on the other hand his abilities seem to serve to show the uniqueness of the human condition as he fails to understand the motivations of others.  And in short order, a few other things have to be mentioned - the acting is surprisingly good, the violence is surprisingly graphic in places, and the soundtrack is wonderfully eclectic.
In short, we have a very rare beast, a special effects driven blockbuster which has imagination and above all - brains.  Your view of this movie may well hinge on your familiarity with the original source material, but whether you have read the graphic novel or not, this is well worth your time, even if it clocks in at a way too long 2hrs 42 minutes.. in fact you may find you have to watch it again just to decide if you like it or not...",1249862400,3,2864,4.7269076305220885

The bad:  For a two disc set, this is stunningly short on extra features.  There are *no* commentary tracks, and only two featurettes on the second DVD.

Though I must say for the most part I think it worked for the movie, because as I said it is not like any other superhero movie out there.  The characters are flawed, and besides Dr. Manhattan they do not have any superpowers.  These are normal men and women dressing up in costumes and saving the day.
For me the best acting of this movie came from Carla Gugino, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan; these two were incredible in their roles.  I have been of fan of both actors for along time.  They seem to have the ability to play almost anything and they really brought these characters to life.  Jackie Earle Haley was another stand out actor for me.  Every scene he was in was amazing.  Patrick Wilson and Malin Akerman were also very good in their roles.  The chemistry between them really helped their characters.  Because of this movie I will never look at another superhero movie the same way again.

Set in an alternate timeline in 1985 where Richard Nixon is on his fifth term as president and the world is on the brink of nuclear war. I missed it in the theaters but managed to catch the Director's Cut on Amazon ""Video on Demand"".

This a world where some of the ""heroes"" are far darker than Batman and are significantly more morally flawed than any of the comic book heroes of my childhood. That being said, these are much more human and therefore much easier to understand, with the exception of the often naked Dr. Manhattan who started as human has become very alien indeed.

No plot spoilers from me, the story centers on the very disturbing hero Rorschach as he tries to figure out who is killing retired (forcibly, by law) masked avengers. Also appearing are The Comedian, Silk Specter II, Night-Owl, and several other retired heroes. All of this takes place against the backdrop of impending global destruction as the US and Soviets prepare to heat up the Cold War.

The cinematography is nothing short of amazing, the mood is set perfectly by the camera shots, lighting, and soundtrack. There are also some outstanding special effects that really add to the realism of the movie. Other than the somewhat gratuitous scenes with Dr. Manhattan's digitally created glowing full frontal nudity, there was very little I didn't enjoy with the technical side of the movie.

The movie has a very graphic love scene and shows a lot of actual human nudity. There is also a good bit of graphic violence and gore, as well as questionable application of vigilantly justice.

Recommended, with the above caveats.",1249689600,6,1660,4.830985915492958

However, it seems that there is an issue with the audio down-mix for Tivo devices.  The audio remastry effort should be done to THX standards, so you can hear the dialog!!!!  Even more frustrating, there were no subtitles with this movie, so I was forced to turn up the volume to hear the dialog, but when explosions happened - I had to rush to turn down the volume again.  It's REALLY terrible if you have to mess with the volume during the entire movie, it takes you out of the ""illusion"" of the movie and makes you focus on the playback hardware in a bad way.

3578462,4,B001FB55H6,"Be it as it may, the Watchmen is a good adaptation of the critically acclaimed graphic novel masterpiece. To put it plainly, this film was the best Hollywood could put together. Starring Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian, a man who parodies the violent human nature. The beautiful Malin Akerman stars as Silk Spectre II, her side-kick, the Night-Owl is played by Patrick Wilson. The man who can take tanks and smash them with a flick of the wrist, and is the USA's only protection from a Soviet attack-Doctor Manhattan-is played by Billy Crudup. And finally, the mysterious, but at-the-same time, awesome, Rorschach, is played by Jackie Earle Haley.

It is obvious that the Blu-Ray version of this film was a long-thought out and intensive process. First and foremost, this is the director's cut, so almost 25 minutes are added on to the already 2hr 40min film. The extended scenes really flow with the movie, and doesn't deteriorate the quality of the film. Exclusive to BD, is the new ""Maximum Movie Mode"", which features director, Zack Snyder, occasionally popping into the shot, while he thoroughly elaborates how he and his crew shot a particular shot, all of which is extremely fascinating.

Disc two features 3, yup, count 'em, 3 documentaries. The first one, entitled, ""The Phenomenon: The Comic That Changed Comics"" talks about the enormity of the success that surrounded the Watchmen comic/graphic novel. It even has an interview with original artist, Dave Gibbons. The other two documentaries, while not as interesting, are exclusive to the BD version. Titled, ""Real Superheroes, Real Vigilantes"" and ""Mechanics: Technologies of a Future World"". Both examine some unknown aspects of the film material and characters.

While the movie may dissapoint some fans, it is the best film Hollywood can ever make. The Watchmen was sometimes called, ""the unfilmable movie"", due to its complex and overarching storyline and themes. People must give Zack Snyder credit, he did an extraordinary job. The Blu-Ray release, displaying in 1080p with 7.1 DTS-HD, has exclusive features that real Watchmen fans will not want to miss.

3578463,4,B001FB55H6,"Anyone who says this movie is a complete waste of time obviously had the wrong expectations while watching it. Anyone who claims this is a masterpiece needs to acquaint themselves with the REAL masterpieces of cinema, because this is DEFINITELY not a masterpiece.
There is a very good movie buried within all of the overlong and/or unnecessary scenes and overused slow-motion. With some copious editing (maybe 20-30 minutes cut)the movie would be improved dramatically. And this is the theatrical version I'm talking about. The Directors Cut has about 30 MORE minutes of unnecessary drivel added in.
The simple fact is that what works well in a book is completely different than what works in a film, and any director who doesn't understand that, or any fanboy who refuses to accept anything other than a complete recreation of their beloved book, doesn't have any comprehension of what a good FILM is. Thus we get unnecessary or overlong scenes with Hollis Mason and Silk Spectre 1, the pointless inclusion of Ozymandius' genetically engineered cat, and more backstory than the film can handle. The one instance where the filmmakers stray from the book - the altered ending - is actually an improvement. Fanboys won't admit it, but it is.
There are other things wrong with the film, too. The music choices are generally way too obvious or are ill-fitting (the exceptions being Bob Dylan and Philip Glass). There is entirely too much gore and slow-motion. The filmmakers also seem to forget that the superheroes (except for Manhattan)aren't supposed to be superhuman.
Still, it is much more ambitious than 95% of other films. It's extremely refreshing, in this age of films for retarded people (anything by Michael Bay for instance), to watch a big-budget action movie that requires the use of your brain. Much of the film is extremely good. I would DEFINITELY recommend this to anyone who isn't turned off by intelligence in their action films, but it is NOT a masterpiece.",1249516800,4,1974,5.003039513677812

One reviewer said see the movie first, then get the graphic novel. I think it would be better the other way. But I'm from
a generation brought up on comics. The graphic-novel version is a piece of art. I was surprised it was in a fixed, regular panel format. But the creators said why they did and, okay, they're the creatives. (But I maintain it's a graphic concept,
and as the movie has done, the more dramatic, innovative formatting, the better.)

Last kibitz: I liked WATCHMEN the first time I viewed it. So much so I viewed it again, and the second time through I saw/understood/appreciated it all the more. I waited a 10 days and again re-viewed it. And more came up and out.

as best as could be done with a few exceptions all considerations given.

the addiciton of the music and the extended version (have not seen the original theatrical release) director's cut is very true to the original storyline and makes valid attempts to improve on it for the transition of the story to a different medium.

the addition of music and choice of the scores added to the story (which is why i wish it could be more true tot he original source material- but transition of mediums makes that near-impossible).

the one problem i had that they seemed to senselessly veer from the source material for no real reason was the endings. not the overall plot by the (you can't really call him/her an antagonist really- don't want to spoil it, nor a protagonist- thats the beauty part).

but i think the original source material dialogue could have been done a lot better at carrying the point rather than the last scenes in the arctic devolving into wtf?

almost like the director wanted to differentiate ""his"" version but failed miserably.

other than that a great adaptation of an even greater story and different where necessary in most cases.

Furthermore I ordered this using the cheapest shipping option on July 24th and despite the predicted delivery date of August 20th, it arrived at my door in the UK on July 30th.

Now the film.  I read the book back in the eighties, so I was looking forward to this.  When I saw Watchmen in the cinema, I had mixed feelings.  Yes, it was a fantastic realisation of the novel.  But I felt it lacked pace in places and that those that were unfamiliar with the story might be quick to get bored.

Those expecting the usual superhero gung-ho fayre are going to be disappointed.  This is a much darker type of film, and it's more of a thriller type of plot.  And be warned: this film contains some quite graphic depictions of violence.  Definitely not for youngsters.  It's definitely a cult film.  You'll either love it or you'll hate it.

Wanted to see this movie mainly because I like the director, Zack Snyder, who did ""300""---which was just a really fun, hyper-testosteroned but well-crafted action flick. S

What I liked:

- nice dark subtext, anti-heroic superheroes, zero pretense of moral piety
- nice soundtrack, esp. the opening 5 minutes set to Dylan's ""The Times They Are A-Changin'""
- excellent pacing, atmospherics, special FX ... visually gorgeous, most of it.
- lotsa juicy bone-crunching, blood-splattering, limb-dismembering fight scenes
- Jackie Earle Haley as Rorshach, what an amazing stand-out performance!

What wasn't so great:

- Malin Ackerman as Laurie Jupiter. Cute, sort of, but not that great. So-so actress.
- the sex scene between Ackerman and Patrick Wilson where they get the big O in the hovercraft which then spurts a big jet of flame. Cheesy-ometer about went through the roof.
- the ending: not that I *demand* happy endings, but this one just felt a little redundant after having watched ""The Dark Knight.""
- conservative bias --- there's a fair bit of liberal-bashing but no equal time for conservative bashing, despite the film's setting: a totally corporatist American dictatorship run by one Tricky Dick Nixon, big-time Republican scumbag.
- a number of dead spots in the script when things get a bit too corny and/or the cast is being asked to deliver far more than it can deliver

Yeah, I'd probably see this film again. Would I want to own it? Probably not.

3 and 1/2 stars.",1249171200,2,1488,5.0
3578518,4,B001FB55H6,"I was not impressed by director Zack Snyder's efforts in ""300.""  While it was a visual feast with impressive special effects, I felt that Snyder used those visuals as a crutch to support a rather dull plot.  The actual historical account of the battle at Thermopylae was, to me, a much better story than Snyder's film or Frank Miller's graphic novel.

With that said, I wasn't expecting much from Snyder's ""Watchmen.""  Based on the comic series by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, I thought that it would be just another special effects-laden, plotless film.  I was quite surprised.

What Snyder has done is take a very good story and give it an excellent treatment on film.  From recreating panels with near perfection from the comics and retaining the bulk of the story, Snyder has outdone himself.

The plot of the film revolves around the murder of one superhero, the Comedian, and the attempts of another, Rorshach, to discover the culprit.  Rorshach tries to drag other former heroes out of retirement with mixed results at first.  Eventually he gets Nite Owl II to help him in his quest.  Another pair of heroes, Silk Spectre II and Dr. Manhattan, also become involved, but they primarily struggle with themselves.  Silk Spectre is trying to find a reason to stay with Dr. Manhattan despite his becoming increasingly detached from her.  Dr. Manhattan has become bored with humanity and also accused of giving cancer to some of his colleagues and spends much of the film in solitude on Mars.  Another former hero, the very public Ozymandias, would rather keep his distance on all matters.

As expected, Snyder does provide excellent special effects.  In fact, they are some of the best I've seen in the last couple of years.  Even the perpetually blue-glowing Dr. Manhattan looks rather convincing on the screen.

Jackie Earle Haley rises above the rest of the cast as Rorshach, the primary catalyst in the film.  He keeps the tale interesting throughout.  He's a tortured soul intent on finding the murderer of his former ally.  Patrick Wilson does an excellent job as the depressed Nite Owl II, who's all but thrown in the towel on being a superhero.  He's somewhat like Batman had Bruce Wayne quit hitting the gym and became a homebody.  Billy Crudup does a good job as Dr. Manhattan, giving a cold and nearly emotionless performance.  Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays the rather unlikeable Comedian, who appears primarily in flashbacks.  He's a disgusting jerk and quite possibly the ultimate anti-hero.  Carla Gugino portrays the original Silk Spectre, and shines as a drunken, washed-up former hero.

The only real disappointments in the acting department were Matthew Goode and Malin Akerman.  Goode just wasn't believable as the super-intelligent old soul called Ozymandias.  His performance was very flat.  Still, he wasn't as bad as Malin Akerman, who delivers a wooden and emotionless performance as Silk Spectre II.  Akerman comes across as a likeable person in real life, but I felt that she wasn't the right person for this particular role.

Despite the subpar efforts of Goode and Akerman, I felt that ""Watchmen"" was a very good film.  Loyal to the source material, full of tormented characters, and giving the viewer a very unique spin on the mythos of superheroes, I highly recommend ""Watchmen.""

Anyway,there is no excuse not to see this movie,even if you don't care about comics. It is a visual feast and so intelligently made!",1248912000,2,370,4.621212121212121
3578589,2,B001FB55H6,"What is this film about on a thematic level?  I was able to identify themes of innocence lost, nostalgia, a longing for simpler times, heroic self-sacrifice.  And yet, the story betrays all of these things in one way or another and emerges in the end as pure insubstantial superhero fluff.  Nothing comes of nothing.  I will try to explain.

The character Rorschach comes out in several instances as being rabidly anti-liberal.  Why?  We don't know.  He just hates liberals.  The film does not provide any decent rationale for this hatred.  Rorschach makes no pro-conservative arguments either.  He is a superhero and he hates liberals.  I guess that's enough for the brain dead fans.  During one monologue, he refers to a dead character named Silhouette, who was a lesbian, and he describes that she was murdered ""for her indecent lifestyle.""  Now that is quite a political statement, and the only glimpse the viewer gets of his ideology on a deeper level than ""Those damn liberals"" type of statements.  Importantly, Rorschach is the only character that we know has a really messed up childhood.  In one flashback scene, the child Rorschach interrupts his slutty mother as she is about to fcuk with some guy, and she tells him she wishes he'd never been born.  Poor kid.  He was poor and his mom did not love him.  Therefore it's all right and all forgiven if he hates liberals, or any other group, for unstated reasons.  Well I say F U little kid!

I thought that the anti-liberal plug was truly weird in light of the fact that, at the start of the comic-book superhero era, these superheroes were often the targets of conservative political forces obsessed with controlling morality and limiting free expression.  Without some liberal politics, superheroes might not exist at all.

For a movie with openly conservative pretensions, this flick is full of naked male deek and hiney.  Early in the movie Dr. Manhattan appears fully nude in his blue birthday suit.  Apparently he never dresses up.  He never rests either, as his terribly important work requires around the clock attention.  He is trying to prevent the end of the world.  Since he never dresses up, whenever he appears on film we are treated to a full view of his naked blue posterior.  I could not see the point of that.  Maybe, since he Dr. Manhattan is radioactive, the film's producers were going to have him crap out an atomic bomb or a hunk of uranium at some point in the movie.

Also there are nude scenes involving another character, a masked superhero named Dan, I believe.  His behind is nicer and fuller than Dr. Manhattan's.  I was just surprised to see so much macho backsides on a comic book inspired film.  Just for the sake of putting it in context, imagine watching Batman having full frontal nude sex with Catwoman, or Robin for that matter.  Or even walking around the bat cave without any clothes on, and in front of Alfred too.  I just did not expect it.

Perhaps the folks at DC have finally guessed that a lot of their readership is composed of homosexuals, closeted or not.  And knowing that, part of their marketing ploy is to address homosexual desire, and have nude superheroes who not only have sexuality but are seen being sexual in their stories.  I think that's brilliant.  Superheroes finally become fully rounded characters, and perhaps only DC can now be credited with that impressive and daring achievement.

There is even an attempted rape of one superhero by another.  The Comedian tries to rape The Silk Spectre.  He is foiled, but The Silk Spectre comes back to him years later and gives him some booty anyway, and even conceives a child with him.  I thought this bit was a little nauseating.  So much for feminism too, I guess.

The principal events of the film take place during indeterminate years, but I saw signs of Presidents Kennedy and Nixon.  The film's music attempts to conjure nostalgia utilizing old and depressing tracks from the 1960's and 1970's.  My problem with nostalgia is that I don't remember the 1970's and 1980's as being simpler or happier times.  I just can't buy into that crap.  Really, if you went to high school during the 1980's, were things really simpler and happier for you?  Kids were crueler and more callous back then than now.  The 1980's were a beech!",1248912000,3,4295,4.7428958051420835
3578590,5,B001FB55H6,"After watching this movie more than a few times, I have to say the ending was especially better than the one in the comic.  The graphic novel for all it's complexity and commentary on the super hero genre, had many subplots, and could easily been lost in translation.  The director seamlessly puts the characters together in a three hour film that entertains the audience.

What impressed me the most was one didn't have to be a fan of the comic. The extras  showed fans, director Zack took his source material seriously. I read this novel when it was published as a mini-series back in 1986-87.  When I knew there was going to be a film based on Watchmen, I thought it was going to be a total loss.  To my surprise it was better than most of the comic related films I saw in the past ten years.  It's a film that can be seen several times.  I get something new each time I see it.

Watchmen was origially a story about the Charlton characters bought by DC comics.  Rosarch ( if I spelled it correctly) was a combination of Steve Ditko's Mr. A and The Question.  I was hoping DC would use the above characters in a set of direct to DVD animated films. At least get an interview Steve Ditko!

That has to be the most common complaint I hear whenever poor 'civilians' are thrown in to this disjointed product - I genuinely feel bad for the masses. As a young man who was active in the comics world during the release of The Watchmen, I can attest to the astounding and ground-breaking impact it had on storytelling, art, and vision. It was the Star Wars of comics - laying waste to the uninspired, underperforming and often flat world that was comic books at the time. When it ended its 1-year run - The Watchmen had changed an entire industry - it was THAT amazing.

But this visually rich film fails at capturing, what is at it's core, a mystery. Who Is killing The Watchmen? And why?

The film is so non-linear that it's very near impossible for the average viewer to take in and process. It's 1953, now it's 1985, now it's 1971, now it's 1944, now it's 1979, now it's... you get the point. Too muddied, too disconnected, too many plotlines to properly thread together a meaningful story.

As a fan, I 'got' what was being offered, and if we were all comic geeks, I think we would be unanimous at this stupendous achievement.

Sadly, and I think this is lost amongst fellow nerds, MOST of the audience are not, and will not, become hardcore fans just to see a film. That Director Snyder sought out the approval of the fans is what unfortunately sinks this film into the mess that the average viewer has to sort out for themselves.

What should have been the focal point, as in the original storyline, was Rorschach. It should've been made clear that it's from his perspective all the surrounding stories swirl. He is us - the audience. We're being taken along a complex  investigation about the deaths of his former comrades. THAT should've been the foundation upon which this story should've been told. But what we get is a mishmash of introductions, flashbacks, intersecting plotlines, dropped plotlines, missed & missing connections - all carried along with spectacular visuals that sadly lose their meaning since it's not placed within the context of  a story that we can readily absorb.

Solution: You start at the past. An introduction of characters; a brief synopsis of who and what they are; what their relations are to one another; what happened to them throughout the years. Boom - 25 minutes of film - the stage is set for the rest of the story. But what happens? Well... what happened.

Watching the Watchmen is like eating cotton candy - visually and texturally appealing, but ultimately leaving you empty inside.",1248825600,3,2590,4.722838137472284

I can't think of many things I liked. I read a little bit of the comic so I could see the comparisons, and the story follows the comic closely. However, the story doesn't play out on the screen as it is essentially not very exciting. There is so much down time in the movie. The action scenes are not choreographed well. Most of them are over WAY too quickly. In a movie that runs nearly 3 hours, there are maybe 30 minutes of action at most. While I don't mind a lot of talking in a movie, all of the talking seems to have no point.

The characters also didn't speak to me. Rorschach is a good hero and fleshed out well in the film, but after the movie was over I didn't really have much interest in him anymore. Dr. Manhattan is better done in my opinion. His monologue near the end is performed very well, and while I hated his monotone voice, I felt like it was appropriate to the character. All of the other characters just seemed like they were trying too hard to act. Maybe its just me, but I really couldn't stand most of them.

I was bored for the entire length of the movie. Nothing thrilled me. If you have never read the comics, I would skip it, as it isn't a good movie.",1248825600,2,1328,4.1395348837209305

The movie doesn't have a happy ending so don't expect walking away from the moive feeling good. The ending was depressing for me. I understand it was for the ""greater good"" but I disagree. There got to be some other way. I was on the other side that unfortunately got killed. What the superheroes did was what a communist nation would do when you think about it. Nothing about the ending to knock the stars down. It was just something to think and discuss about.

The movie has some very graphic violence and strong sexual content. It is NOT suitable for people under age of 17. I could imagine some ignorant parents taking their children to the movie, thinking it was just another popcorn superhero flick. Haha! I feel sorry for them.

3578643,3,B001FB55H6,"For years, many had wanted to make Alan Moore's critically acclaimed graphic novel Watchmen into a moving picture and, for years, many had wanted to spend their hard-earned dollars to see it done, but it was always one of those projects that was said to be impossible to transfer.  That is, until director Zack Snyder took the reins.

Though, it is obvious here that Snyder was so worried about pissing off the super-fans that he made this film a near carbon copy of the novel.  While the film isn't horrible, it could have benefited from some poetic license, provided said license was properly executed.  It seems that Snyder abstained from tweaking anything for fear of ruining everything, unless he just felt that the source material was so perfect that no edits were necessary, which I doubt.

The result is that Watchmen is that rare film that most folks can agree on in that age-old debate of whether or not to see the film before or after you've read the book.  Here, it actually doesn't matter because they are, for the most part, one and the same.  There is nothing new here that wasn't printed there, save for the edited ending.  (SPOILER: Which the updated ending truly doesn't compare to a series of breathtaking, wordless panels consisting of people becoming permanent shadows.)

Even the dialogue here remains mostly unchanged, which is perhaps the film's biggest tell, as is the incredibly awkward and seemingly drawn out love scene between Laurie Jupiter/Silk Spectre II (Malin Ackerman) and Dan Dreiberg/Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson).  Or perhaps it just seems so drawn out because of how incredibly awkward it is.

While the graphic novel has won numerous awards (including the Hugo award in 1988), its adaptation seems like it was peeled off of the page and dropped directly into a film canister.  Moore declined to have his name attached to this project because he felt that no film adaptation could ever do his work justice. While that may seem a bit pretentious (come on, do you really believe that of the millions of people who possess a knack for film-making, none of them could ever get the adaptation right?), I tend to agree with him here.  Though, rather than saying that no one could ever properly scratch that itch, I believe that Watchmen is like Batman in that we'll have to suffer through a few lackluster tries first before we finally get the Chris Nolan version.

Watchmen's story stems from a world wherein a mystery villain is picking off what's left of the Watchmen superheroes, most of whom have long since retired. We open the film with a cool fight scene in which Edward Blake/The Comedian, (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), is trying to defend himself against an intruder in his apartment, a trespasser whom he recognizes but who remains unseen by the audience. Blake ultimately falls to his death, and Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), arguably the most bad-ass character, decides to personally investigate the matter. Rorschach, unlike his peers, has never given up the fight against evil and never will, a crusade that eventually lands him in prison.

Meanwhile, Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), the only superhero here who possesses actual super powers, flits off to Mars when gal pal Jupiter announces that she's leaving him. Because Jupiter is all Dr. Manhattan really cares about, he feels like life isn't worth living anymore when she leaves, and not just his own - he spends his time on Mars contemplating the possibility of destroying Earth (cheer up, emo kid).  Little does anyone know, however, that the aforementioned mystery villain has a similar plan.

No matter which of Watchmen's endings you prefer, be it the novel's version or the film's, both are equally scary and, oddly, hopeful.",1248825600,2,3724,4.913875598086125

Already I was scared -- an alternate America where Nixon is going on to a third term?  Every baby boomer's nightmare.  However, the old rock, Pete Seeger and Paul Simon songs lulled me into a ""oh boy"" factor -- and in a lot of ways it was ""oh boy.""

The fight scenes were nicely choreographed.  Silk Spectre II and the Night Owl made a great team.

Did I care for the Comedian or that he was murdered early in the film?  Nope.  A very anti-hero's hero.  Whatever heroism he had in the Forties was lost on me.  Beating up and raping, shooting a pregnant woman, -- in fact, women were handled fairly badly throughout the film purely for shock value.  What was Alan Moore thinking?

There's a difference between breaking the mold in comic book or filming and then there's just plain porn.  Porn in the sense of  blood and guts and gore and Moore's almost misogynous writing as well as  the broken bones cutting through flesh, chopping off limbs with a saw, and buckets of blood -- a lot of the violence a bit too much.

A film not for the squeamish.

Zack Snyder's 300 was quite the tour de force -- the ancients were as bad and as bloody as they came complete with ""madness.""

Watchmen was uneven.  I was thrilled ,repulsed and excited and depressed all at once.

Almost like an X-rated ""the Incredibles""; heroes being banned (becoming and old hat plot) and then coming back -- except in The Incredibles the heroes won.  In Watchmen, the ""heroes"" put a lot of people away in the name of ""peace.""

Ozymandias' doubtful morals and Rorschach's intense right-wing ethics makes the film watchable.

Co-starring Matt Frewer, this brilliant adaptation of David Gibbon's and Alan Moore's classic graphic novel. After years of development hell through various studios, Warner Brothers wih DC films and Paramount have finally greenlighted the film thanks to the director Zack Snydner's successful ""300"" which in turn was based on a graphic novel. I'd say it was worth the effort Snyder has done to bring a classic masterpiece of comics to the big screen in a successful way in fact he's a fan of the graphic novel and used it as storyboards for the film. It's a complex mix of superhero film, fantasy, Sci-fi and film noir all combined as it's definitely a comic book movie not for kids due to some language, gory violence and sexuality  but more for adult audiences. Greg Cannom's make-up effects even for Nixon are quite convincing and has terrific acting with wonderous special effects and great action sequences. It's Zack Sydner's finest hour next to ""300"" for it's one of the best comic book movies in recent memory.

This Blu-Ray offers a high theatrical quality experience that will sky-rocket your home system up into orbit and offers the movie in it's extended director's cut the way it was meant to be. Featurettes include BD-exclusive Maximum Experience which is a feature length live commentary by Zack Sydner including on how he took the graphic novel to the silver screen, featurettes, music video and 11 Watchmen Video Journels and BD-live exclusives.",1248739200,5,2359,5.074742268041237

3578697,4,B001FB55H6,"I did not read the graphic novel, so apparently I represent the group of people not familiar with anything about the story who nevertheless thought the film version was terrific! (And frankly I'm getting weary of reading reviews by snobby critics who claim that the film could only possibly appeal to those already familiar with the novel.)

What I saw was an intelligent, engaging, completely original film with compelling characters and--yes--a strong narrative. Again, I'm mystified by those critics who say there's no story.  Have they seen the same film I did? I'll admit, the plot is a lot more complex--i.e. non-formulaic--than recent superhero films (Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, etc.), but since when did it become valid criticism to knock a film's story, simply because it happens to be a little more demanding than the usual fare?

Simply put, this is the film for those of us who like ""Citizen Kane"" but disdain the big studio, special-effects, franchise clones the studios crank out year after year.

Confusing? Not to me. In fact, I thought everything was set up in an easy-to-follow manner. Granted, it doesn't follow a straight linear path, but that's one of the unusual things about the film that makes it work so well.

Everything about this film is top-notch.  If I have any criticism, it's with the Comedian character.  As others have pointed out, his actions in the film are so vile, it's hard to understand how he ended up in the ""hero"" camp. I understand the attempt to humanize superheros and give them real problems, but I think a line is crossed when the Comedian guns down his pregnant girlfriend (not to mention attempts to rape one of his partners). No matter how jaded his partners are, it's a little hard to swallow that they don't turn against him at some point.",1248739200,6,1792,4.836601307189542

Blah blah blah, after the first 3 hours (yes its that long) it really doesn't matter what the script is, it all sounds the same. So much visual emotion is expressed in the first 15 minutes that the rest leaves the viewer numb and in a state of sheer bordom. This goes for everything, the sound track, the graphics, the gore, the script... its so dramatic and intense that it cancels itself out.

Imagine if the great Star Wars trilogy was originally 3 years long. You'd want to murder the Ewoks by the first 12 hours and Ja Ja Binks the next (if not sooner)... now you've got 1094 days left to fill watching the same not-so-dramatic dialog repeat itself for the next 1094 days.

3578720,4,B001FB55H6,"First Thing....
i never read the comic, but was interested in the following that this franchise brings. quite the hype, i must say.
I'm actually very torn about this movie, i like it in general but there's alot i don't understand and will have to rewatch it to get everything.
It was too long, I bought the blu ray directors cut, because i always feel like i'm getting ripped off if i buy the theatrical version. I wanna see the film the way the director intended not what they edited out for theatrical viewing. Regardless it was too long and alot could have been taken out and the impact would have been the same. at least for me.
Alot of people are not happy about the amount of violence in this movie. I didn't find the violence as graphic as people are making it out to be. I'm sure everyone has seen a horror movie before so i don't know what the big deal is here. The rating is ""R"" for ""graphic violence, Sexuality, nudity, and language."" Bottom line: Read the Warning/Rating before watching the movie.
Second thing people are not happy about is the Full Frontal Nudity of John Manhattan. Big deal, really. We've been looking at women naked for years. Aside from that, the nudity was done very very tastefully. Never once was the nudity used in a sexual situation. It brought beauty to the male form that no film has ever was able to do. I applaud the director for bringing that into the film in such a graceful natural way.
Really everyone, if you don't want to see this stuff, watch the theatrical version. thats why its available.
I guess i rate it 4 stars as i'm so intrigued by the characters and the storyline and watching this film in blu way was wonderful. A great example of what Blu Ray should be.",1248652800,4,1714,4.410094637223975
3578721,5,B001FB55H6,"I was never a comic book person, so I didn't know about Watchmen until I saw the trailer for the movie. Love at first sight! I bought the Smashing Pumpkins song used in the trailer from Amazon MP3 Downloads. I bought the graphic novel and bit my nails for 2 days waiting for it to come. Almost blew an artery when I read that the release date might be held up because of movie studio b.s.! Never in my life have I felt this way about a piece of media. And so now it bugs me to no end to read the reviews of people who didn't read the book (!!!!) and are apparently total action junkies like my 11 year old (!!!) and dare to say things like ""it was boring"" or ""the story never got pumping"". Its not an action movie. Nobody ever said it was an action movie. Its a character study (have never used those words before in my entire life) about ordinary people who dared to live un-ordinary lives. Why would someone do that? What are the consequences of such a decision? And what does a person who literally can do anything he wants, actually do? Is he human? Does he have human feelings? And if he isn't human, what about the humans that he is surrounded by? Are they worse or better than him? These things are explored in Watchmen. Personality and nature vs. nuture. You want action and not to have to think while watching a movie? This is not the movie for that.

And as for the person who said that people were tricked into taking their kids? No way. This movie was clearly rated R. And NOBODY said it was for kids! I told my kid that he has to be 13 before I even let him read the book! Maybe I'll let him see the movie when he's 17. Any parent who took a kid to this movie (and there was such a moron at the showing I went to) needs to go to parenting classes or have their kid taken away, cause they clearly don't know how to be a good parent. Read the ratings people! Same thing happened with Sin City and 300. Just cause it looks like a cartoon, doesn't mean children should be there.

Final: this is a good movie. Its a great movie. Its a visually stunning drama and it absolutely deserves all the praise it gets. Perhaps the author will get over himself and embrace this lovely tribute to his vision. Fingers crossed.",1248652800,3,2222,4.177156177156177

The commercials threw me off, of course I should have realized that part of marketing strategy is to fool consumers and show the best parts of the movies. There was no action like I expected, way too much talking, and the plot sucked. And for the kids? Yeah right, there was a soft porn scene in it, with kids in the theatre. But then again, the film was rated R. But if thats the case then the Spice channel which shows soft porn should be available for everyone to watch, it was literally the same thing. That probably was the highlight for many people in the cinema, but it did not help the movie. Sometimes I wonder why producers and directors go on with movies if its clearly a horrible project.

Definitely not appropriate for younger, less mature viewers, it brings up questions about the nature of goodness, and the moral ambiguity of some necessary choices.

This movie is probably misunderstood by many (probably because they were expecting another Fantastic Four) and in this form, will never reach its deserved ""attention"" so to speak.

3578748,4,B001FB55H6,"I really wanted to see this film at the theater, but I just couldn't make it happen. I guess it was for the best because I was able to see the ""director's cut"" on DVD with additional scenes. I usually prefer director's cuts anyway.

Anywho, I remember reading the Watchmen comic series when it was originally released back in the mid-80s. Back then, I knew I was reading something special, so I really looked forward to seeing the movie version.

I must say, though, that this movie would have had a much bigger impact if it had been released before the 90s when the cold war was still in full swing. The threat of nuclear war just doesn't have the sting today as it did during those days.

On the good side, I found the film to be very faithful to the graphic novel (I haven't read it in many years, but from what I can remember, the movie follows the comic very well; almost verbatim in some areas). The story is excellently crafted and makes you think. This is not your typical superheroes-save-the-world type of plot. It's dark, it's violent and the ""heroes"" have some serious flaws.

The movie is visually stunning. It is simply a pleasure to look at. The effects, costumes, music, sets, etc. are all brilliantly done and come together to craft an excellent film.

The casting was done well, but the standout performance here seems to be Jackie Earle Haley as the ""anti-hero"" Rorschach. His performance can be likened to Heath Ledger's Joker from last year's ""The Dark Knight"". Haley steals the movie with a truly tremendous performance. He personified the charcter so completely that whenever he is on screen, you can't help but notice his truly magnificent performance.

All in all, Watchmen is a very enjoyable film and is worth repeated viewings. Many people complained about Dr. Manhattan's anatomy being too revealing, but if you think about his detachemnt from humanity, it is very fitting. It wasn't done in a gratuitous way and was not in the slightest bit sexual. Readers of the original graphic novel will remember that there were scenes of his ""anatomy"" in the comic as well. Come on, people. It's just a body part. All of us dudes have them. Let's grow up a little. There were also complaints about the film's graphic violence, but I've seen worse (try ""Kill Bill"" if you want excessive amounts of blood and gore).

I recommend this film, but it definitely isn't for everyone. You might want to keep the kiddies away from this one. It's for mature audiences only.",1248652800,16,2481,4.676605504587156

My wife and I kept thinking, when will this story get going, get on with it already.  While I enjoyed the films beautiful effects and scene compositions, the story never gets pumping.  I never had any empathy for any of the characters in this movie. In fact after the movie was over the only character I found even remotely redeeming was Rorschach, and he was a sociopathic killer. I'm very sorry I bought this DVD knowing that I didn't like the book. I should have known better. A total waste of money.",1248652800,3,817,4.469798657718121
3578750,3,B001FB55H6,"I just finished watching the theatrical version of the Watchmen and it is obvious that they took a great deal of time getting every visual detail correct.  Some of the images are pitch perfect to the source material.  That said, the movie had no flow, no passion.

As a fan of the graphic novel, I could fill in the missing pieces - items thrown away in the movie like Dan's last name, the tell all book, why Dr. Manhattan chose to mark his forehead that way, or why he was naked in the first place...  So much of the back story was excised that the important elements - elements that gave the graphic novel so much depth and turned a comic book mini-series into legitimate literature - were made to be unimportant.  You got flashes of the back stories, but ultimately since they don't contribute to the overarching story of nuclear annihilation, they didn't get the screen time they deserve. It is here where the film makers missed the point.  The Watchmen is only about the back stories.

With the back stories, you have a rich meditation on heroism, how great men and women sacrifice who they are to serve the common good, and to what lengths heroes will go to complete their callings.  Without them, you are left with a thin murder mystery involving capes you've never met before, a story that moves so quickly that doesn't give you time to care about the characters, and beautifully filmed violence. That's not good enough.

I'm going to give The Watchmen: Director's Cut a viewing.  If I feel the same way about the movie after I see the extended scenes, then I'm done with it.  In the meantime, I will always have the graphic novel to completely experience the universe that Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons envisioned. And that's the version I whole heartedly recommend with five stars.

If you are a teenager, you would feel like you are starting to play a video game for 2 minutes, and then your mother comes in and tells you to do your homework for 30 minutes, and you have to obey.

Wanting to find out for myself I bought the Blu-ray version and gave it a shot. All I can say is WOW.

The Blue-ray looks stunning. Remarkable scenes and pure eye candy as are with most comic book movies released on blue-ray. But the story and it's hcaracters were fresh, original, and not at all for children. The story in a way is a basic superhero type storyline. A band groups together to stop what seems like a sinister plot. But this is not your typical superhero movie. The charaters are terribly flawed which is brought out wonderfuly by developing each character and it's dark past. When I say dark I mean murdering, rapeing, and even darker secrets that are revealed slowly though the movie. They are haunting yet at the same time show that even surehero's are not perfect (some far from it). Only one character even has superpowers. The rest are all just people. People who try to do right even if sometimes what seems right is actually wrong. There is a moral battle throughout the movie that constatly keeps you on the edge.

Even the ending is not what you would expect. I won't give it away, but the typical superhero 'evil is punished in the end' storybook ending does not exist here. Be prepared to be thrown off.

As for the Blu-ray quality all I can say is that the visuals look amazing. If your someone who has a Blu-ray player bit is leery about which movies to buy because of the price, all i can say is that this is one that yuo won't regret buying. A cool extra is included as well which mixes directors commentary along with actauly showing as the movie plays how some of the scenes were shot, along with comic book and stryboeard comparisons, and a timeline showing how the world of the Watchmen differs with the history of our world.

There are so many nuances and wow factors that it would take a book to describe them here.

Beware, in the directors cut, there is some frontal male nudity, albeit  from a blue being. There are a few extremely violent scenes as well. It's long too. Just over 3 hours. The only thing that I think didn't fit in some scenes was the music. Too Vietnam-ish.

3578757,4,B001FB55H6,"I watched this movie as someone who was a big fan of the original graphic novel and so from that perspective I thought it was an above average movie, not a classic.  I think the scope of the story as concieved by the book's author was just too big to do it justice in a movie format.  It was better suited for something like an HBO miniseries.  Its hard to get into all the details/backdrop of the characters when your constrained to a 3 hour movie timeframe so consequently character development suffers and things seem rushed.  Given all that I still thought the movie was really good because it did such an amazing job in bringing to life the panels of a comic book that I loved.  Its a very entertaining film with some great scenes.

Its worth noting that the graphic novel in which this movie practically mirrors in terms of story, characters and visuals was created back in 1986.  So when people say that Watchmen is influenced by this movie or its a rehash of that movie then the counter point is whatever came out after 1986 was influenced BY The Watchmen not the other way around.  Who knows, if this movie came out in 1986 it might have been considered ground breaking but over the course of 20+ years its probably not as fresh or relevant for some people as it gets lost amongst the shuffle of all the other superhero movies out there.",1248566400,4,1346,4.421052631578948
3578778,4,B001FB55H6,"Let's begin by offering a nutshell summary for those not familiar with this material. This film is an adaptation of the legendary graphic novel ""Watchmen"". It was a watershed for the comics industry. It brought existentialism, societal pertinence and a healthy dose of science fiction to a medium that was becoming dull and predictable. This is a ""what if"" story that generates an alternate 1980's America in which costumed vigilantes have altered the course of history. What is interesting about this? It's not always for the better.

I'll leave the details alone for you to uncover. They're simply too compelling to explain to you in a review, you deserve more. Now on to this film. This movie is both the first and last of its kind. It is the single most loyal adaptation of any comic book/graphic novel that has ever been done (I'm including '300' and 'Sin City' in this). Almost all of the images presented here appear to have been lifted out of the book's original panels. Any additions or changes are so respectful that they might as well have appeared in the book. Fans of the graphic novel will have a field day picking out the dozens of visual easter eggs that allude to memorable details from the graphic novel. This simply hasn't been accomplished on this level in any other comic based film we've ever seen.

The action sequences in the film are not quite as loyal. To light some fire under the story, Zak Snyder chose to unleash his unique brand of visceral stop-go violence on the film and it fits here just fine. It does the most justice to the opening scene that depicts the assasination of the 'Comedian'. It is operatically set to Nat King Cole's 'Unforgettable' as if to say; ""we love you Watchmen"". A warning though, some of the violence is excessive at points and may disturb the weak of stomach. So heads up.

For those who saw this in the theater, the director's cut adds 24 minutes to your original experience. Mostly, it's a little more here, little more there. But there is the wonderful addition of Hollis Mason's death. That addition alone is worth picking up the extended cut. In the book, it's made out to be a tragic ending for a sweet old man. Here though, Hollis is given a wonderful chance to re-live the golden days and bust the heads of all the bad guys he's fought in his career one last time. It's visually intriguing and, even though it ends badly, it will put a smile on your face for the lovable ex-hero.

The Blu-Ray itself contains 3 additonal videos that praise the original book, look back on the history of vigilantes in the U.S. and examine the science-fiction presented in the story. They're fun supplemental add-ons to the film that enrich the experience. Then there's the ""Mega Movie Mode"" where Zak Snyder explains the movie to you as it plays. I haven't personally checked that out, but it sounds like a cool way to get insight on the film's creation. Overall, strong set of bonus features here.

This has gone on longer than I intended, so let's rap this up. This is a unique film that provides a gorgeous interpretation of what Time Magazine called one of the 100 best novels of all time. It's loyal, intense, violent and surprisingly thought provoking (another element preserved from the graphic novel). So why did I call it the first and last of its kind? Sadly, the film did not achieve great mainstream success, grossing just barely over $100 million. Maybe it's the deconstructivist themes, the violence or its lack of commonly recognized characters (i.e. batman), but one thing's for certain, it never will. Films like this one don't ring out as popular masterpieces. They find an audience that loves them and they stay near and dear to the heart. If you're a fan of the book or someone who's willing to experience something radically different from your typical cinema experience give it a shot. Otherwise, this wasn't meant for you.",1248480000,13,3895,4.69692532942899

For those of you that don't read the fine print, like me, the digital copy that is bundled with your purchase can be viewed anytime within 30 days of your purchase. However, once the digital copy has been started you have 24 hrs to view it as many times within the 24 hr period before your license for the digital copy expires. Then if you wish to view the digital version again you have to purchase another license.

This is my first time using Amazons digital video, and based on my experience my last.

I just felt someone should mention that the digital copy in the Director's Cut set is actually the theatrical version, and not the Director's Cut.

I find this to be an odd choice: Now I still don't have a digital copy of the movie I purchased. What was the thinking here, Warner Bros?",1248480000,3,350,4.287878787878788
3578781,4,B001FB55H6,"I felt the theatrical version of the film was outstanding and was very interested in this version when it was announced. There was almost nothing about that version that I did not like. I will not try to itemize the many differences in this version. About 25 minutes of extra film enlarges the parts of many of the main characters and includes the death of the original Night Owl with flashbacks of his own days as a hero. Overall the longer version does have some excellent material.

However, one of the parts of Watchman I was not as happy about was the very graphic violence which in the theatrical version was right at the edge of snuff film quality. This version adds extra gore and horrorific violence to almost every seen that was already almost too much. Unless you have a very strong stomach this is not the version for you.

Disk 2, the extra's disc is also a disappointment with very little to make it worthwhile.",1248480000,2,925,4.532934131736527
3578782,4,B001FB55H6,"""Watchmen"" was famously considered unfilmable. Considering that fact alone, that this film is both faithful to the graphic novel, and highly watchable, is exceptional. Zach Snyder brought these characteristics to ""300"", and fans of both graphic novels should feel that he's done them justice. Snyder clearly has a great deal of respect for the visual aspects of the medium.

Not that ""Watchmen"" is for everyone. It's incredibly gory, at times off-putting. The fight scenes are unnecessarily long. The pacing, while fairly faithful to the novel, doesn't always translate well to film. Occasionally you'll find yourself tuning out, waiting to return to something like a core storyline. This is a problem shared by the novel, which essentially has an interchangeable third act, but it's even clearer in this medium.

It may be hard for some viewers to relate to the 1980's global thermonuclear war theme, but it's only a backdrop to the core theme of the novel - that human beings are vicious self-destructive animals, but also worthy of love and salvation - and it's updated in subtle ways. Notice how Snyder & co. skip past the terrorism-boogieman theme and focus on expansionist governments and rampant corporatism. Viewers of the Blu-Ray disc might appreciate the alternate timeline feature, which hints that, while it wasn't explicitly shown, Nixon was also on that grassy knoll...

I felt the only real miscue was the use of period music sync. ""The Times They Are A-Changin'"" held up OK, but most others felt terribly out of place. Only Phillip Glass's cues from ""Koyaanisqatsi"" really fit.",1248480000,4,1593,5.142857142857143

I was just interested in visual effects and the fact that it was a super hero movie. So I figured what the heck. My first clue should have been the fact that it was Rated R. Maybe I am a bit over sensitive but I was turned off by two things:

1. Lack of a background about the super heroes. I would have liked to know more. It seemed compressed to me.

2. Male frontal nudity in several scenes. I'd like someone to explain to me how that helped the plot/storyline.

I saw this movie with a few friends who are less critical than I am and one of them asked afterwards if this movie warranted a ""What The ----?"". Which spoke volumes to me.

It hit all the right spots at all the right times.
From the opening scene, to the ending credits, I enjoyed this movie more than even The Dark Knight 8 months prior. The biggest thing I liked about this movie was that it wasn't afraid to push the envelope of decency.

All sorts of comic-based movies like to be clean, cookie-cutter action movies with lots of explosions. Not so here. There is a solid plot, almost spot-on with the graphic novel (up until the ending, which they changed for a very good reason), and it has all the violence, sex, and mature themes of any other solid R-Rated movie. And solid this one is. Maybe some people got freaked out at Dr. Manhattan's manhood, but if you're so 'hung' on that, you probably weren't paying attention to the other subtleties that turned this movie from a good movie to a great one.
Some said this movie could never be done. I beg to differ. Five stars all around!

No Country For Old Super-Heroes

THE WATCHMEN is another movie based on a comic book - er, GRAPHIC NOVEL. First  picked up in 1986 by 20th Century Fox, the project bounced around the world from the US to the UK to Czechoslovakia, resting briefly at just about every major studio in the world. There were multiple scripts drafted, multiple directors tapped, and a Who's-Who of Hollywood talent courted for the lead roles.  In the end, we got exactly what you'd expect to get: a mess.

Think of THE WATCHMEN as The Incredibles, only a lot less entertaining. This is a live-action story of the last of the super-heroes. At the start of the film, we are treated to a wonderful montage that tells us ""the story so far."" I'm not exaggerating when I say we're treated to it. It's the best part of the film. They should have stopped right there, but they didn't. And I hear that the DVD has 20 minutes MORE for us to suffer through. That comes to 182 minutes of watch-watching pain. I digress.

THE WATCHMEN is set in 1985. Richard Nixon is somehow in his third term, the Soviet Union is about to nuke us, and a giant blue super-hero named Doctor Manhattan straddles the world. Naked. (He's naturally blue, too.) Doctor Manhattan is omnipotent which makes him boring. His pal is called Ozymandias, after the Percy Shelley poem. He's all-knowing which makes him petulant and boring. Then there's Doctor Manhattan's love interest, her mom, her former love interest (pretty but boring, boring in bad make-up, could be interesting but is as boring as day-old toast) and the Comedian, an absolutely unlikeable guy who rapes, murders, and laughs about it all. I wish he had been boring, but he was just disturbing.

The only interesting character in THE WATCHMEN is Rorschach. His face is an ever-shifting Rorschach ink pattern, which is really cool but odd since he is the only one who doesn't waver in his ideals and commitment. He's a hard-boiled detective who has completely lost sight of the ""the line."" He doesn't need no stinkin' line. He makes his own line. Rorschach is really the driving force of the flick. His scenes are interesting, understandable, and move the plodding plot along. Even so, some of his scenes are gruesome and unnecessary for the character or the story.

Honestly, I get disgusted remembering THE WATCHMEN, not because of the needless gore but because of the wasted effort. The cinematography is wonderful, the soundtrack is classic, but the acting is dreadful and the story is deadly dull with a wholly unsatisfying ending. Yes, I admit it; I sat through the whole thing. I was just HOPING something good would happen. And it did! THE WATCHMEN finally ended.",1248480000,27,2679,4.760775862068965
3578818,3,B001FB55H6,"I've ordered three Blu-ray movies from Amazon.com and each one of them was sent in a bubble envelope mailer instead of a cardboard box.  Each one of the movies arrived with slight-to-moderate damage to the Blu-ray case (amaray).

The present version of the Blu-ray case is relatively flimsy compared to the standard DVD case.  I hope someone comes up with another, sturdier version.  Of course if you buy a Blu-ray at the store and take it home it probably won't suffer the same damage mine did.

Amazon -- are you paying attention?

I opened the BD case hoping to find a booklet that would list all the bonus content.  Nope.  There ain't one.  But there IS, however, an insert telling us that a 5-disc ultimate collector's edition of the movie is due out in December 2009.  The insert includes directions on how to get a $10 discount on the Ultimate set, but you have to join the studio's rewards program.  There's always a catch, isn't there?  Join the rewards program and they will email you the discount coupon/code a few weeks before the DVD street date.

Interesting that this release of ""Watchmen"" is an extended cut and that there doesn't appear to be an option to watch the theatrical cut.  What if you are one of the folks that likes the theatrical cut better than the extended cut?  Are you just out of luck?  Will you have to purchase the Ultimate Collector's edition to see the theatrical cut (if it is even included)?

We had the same problem with ""Amadeus"".  A Director's Cut was released on DVD and, later, Blu-ray that didn't include the option to see the original theatrical cut instead.  Personally I prefer the theatrical cut of that film.  Seems unfair that we grow to love a certain version of a film and then are asked to buy a DIFFERENT version of it if we want to have a copy to own.

""Watchmen"" is the same way.  It would have been nice to walk out of the theater knowing we could buy the movie we JUST SAW when it comes out on DVD, perhaps with the option of seeing additional footage too.  But no -- can't do that.

It's like a meal at a restaurant where the dish is prepared one way for dine-in customers and a different way for take-out orders.  What if you want take-out but like the dine-in version better?  Sorry.  Too bad.

The other issue is the sound mix.  If you play it at a level where you can comfortably hear the dialogue, the sound effects are deafening. Don't hand me the ""if it's too loud, you're too old"" argument, either.  That's for concerts, not home video.  It is especially noticeable in the opening scene.  I live in an apartment with reasonably thick walls, but I still have to play this BD at lower-than-normal volume and turn on the English subtitle track.  I want to enjoy it but I'm not going to force my neighbors to suffer through it.

3578819,4,B001FB55H6,"I wanted to read the ""Watchmen"" graphic novel before I saw the movie.  I did and I'm glad I did.  It was an intricate, convoluted bit of storytelling that never failed to fascinate... except for the ending.  I'll say it, and let the fanboys come out swinging:  the ending Alan Moore wrote in the book was preposterous.

The movie changed it.  Somewhere, praise the lord and pass the red pencil, during the scripting process, someone had the guts to say, ""You know, the original ending makes no sense. What if we changed it to...""  And they did.  And it does make a whole heap o' more sense than Moore's.

Comparing a book to a movie is essentially folly.  They are completely different animals.  People make the mistake of thinking they're similar because you can compare plot points and snippets of dialog, but those parallel details don't add up to the gulf of difference between the two media.

Still, that all said, I found watching ""Watchmen"" ultimately more satisfying than reading it because the filmmakers were smart enough to end it with an ""Aha!"" rather than a ""Huh?""  Bravo to them.",1248393600,5,1093,4.689473684210526

3578822,3,B001FB55H6,"For the most part, Watchmen is a decent movie. Up until the end of the movie, I was loving every minute of it. The film was staying 98% true to the graphic novel and then it all fell apart within the last hour. Things are cut, changed and the lack of urgency about saving the world is missing. In the novel, there is a real urgency about Dr. Manhattan and his need to return to save the planet, but the emotion of it is lost in the film. The main reason being things being cut, crucial parts being left out, and other plot points being changed (as mentioned before). I had to explain what was happening on screen to help fill the gaps to the others I was watching it with who haven't read the book. That's bad when there are pieces missing I have to fill for the film to make sense.

Between the two (book and movie), the book is better. I'd recommend this movie probably more to those who haven't read the novel. That being said, I still liked it overall for the most part.

The mere fact that that didn't happen would be enough to get a stellar review out of me, but Watchmen the movie holds its own as a solid movie adaptation of a complex, haunting story.

Zack Snyder's directing is visually impressive without being distractingly oppressive, as it tends to be in his other comic-book movie 300.  The script changes grate on a purist like myself, but I can see how they would be necessary for wider audiences.  The acting is fantastic, particularly Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach and Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the Comedian.  With such a large cast of characters, the Director's Cut offers additional time to the development of each, bringing them closer to the three-dimensional, flawed, messy, morally ambiguous human beings they are in the source material.

While the movie never reaches the genius of the comic, its failings are due to the limitations of film as a medium.  Alan Moore's objection to the film adaptations is largely that Watchmen was never intended to be a movie, that things were done in comic-form that could only be done in comic-form.  I'm inclined to disagree- some things were done that don't translate, but the rest translates into a great movie that's both compelling and entertaining.",1248393600,,1404,4.9957081545064375
3578824,5,B001FB55H6,"Hello everyone! This is my first review so bear with me.

I just got the Watchmen Night Owl Ship Edition today in the mail (only took 4 days from the release date to my house in Minnesota) and I am very pleased!

I was a little disappointed on the size of ship which is smaller then I thought but is not a reason to re-consider. I do not recommend people to get this unless they are DIE HARD fans like I am. If you are just buying this as a person that liked the movie, just pick up the normal 2 disc blu-ray edition.

The ship's detail is VERY great. It does not have an interior (I expected that) because of the lights inside. When the lights are lit on the water, it glows a tinge of blue that is great.

Another downside to the product is that the discs aren't in a real Blu-Ray case. They are in thick, plastic - like, sleeves. For me that is disappointing because I have a collection of Blu-Ray's and I want to add to it with this great film. But a small price to pay for this great product.

Now the actual Blu-Ray is VERY good! Only thing I disliked is that it doesn't start on an actual ""menu"" but just commences the original Director's Cut. You may bring up the sub-menu though.

The maximum mode for the film is great! It does behind the scenes on the entire film with Zach Snyder, comic book comparisons and storyboards! I am watching it now and I am very impressed!

And the film itself is breathtaking! Every scene is so vibrant and fresh! It follows the graphic novel so well too! It also looks INCREDIBLE on Blu-Ray.

Running almost 3 hours, this is the version to own, you get more dialogue, extended scenes, more depth to the characters and feels more in touch with the graphic novel. Where the theatrical release, as it was good I felt it seemed short, it needed something more, and Thank God for Blu Ray. We all know the graphic novel has so much and one can only cram so much into the movie, I believe Snyder and Co. did just that, found that right balance to honor the graphic novel and stay close to the source material. This is a very well adapted graphic novel for the screen. And I don't care what everyone says but Snyder and Tyler Bates sure know how to come up with a great soundtrack, other music mastermind for soundtracks is Tarantino! Anyways this and Sin City so far are the best adaptations in my humble opinion. On to the Blu Ray, picture was outstanding!! You can see each individual particles when Dr. Manhattan zaps people to another spot. The sound was wonderful. I was very pleased with this, the picture was just so sharp and clear. This is a flawless Blu Ray. Have to say there are some movies that is a must have in a collector's DVD collection to fully appreciate that beautiful Hi-Def quality. This is one, Dark Knight, Serenity, Transformers, Iron Man, and 300 are the others in my most humble opinion should be in one's collection!

3578826,4,B001FB55H6,"""Watchmen"" when it debuted in mid '80s was a groundbreaking event in the world of comics.  Along with Frank Miller's ""The Dark Knight Returns"" it began to change the fundamental perceptions of comics -- that they were strictly kid stuff.  ""Watchmen"" helped establish that the comic book medium could be used to tell serious, thoughtful, adult-themed stories, that discriminating readers could enjoy and appreciate.  Now that Hollywood has discovered comic books as a source of movie ideas, and each comic book adaptation comes practically tripping on the heels of its predecessor, I suppose it was only a matter of time before ""Watchmen"" was translated to the silver screen.  It was worth the wait in this case.

Most people familiar with comics will be familiar with Alan Moore's very public comments repudiating this movie, sight unseen, even to the point of denigrating its director.  Alan Moore needs to get over himself.  I understand he has good cause to feel disappointed with Hollywood, given the awfulness of some previous adaptations of his work.  But he has overreacted, like a kid who wants to take his ball and go home now.  He has declared ""Watchmen"" to be ""unfilmable,"" which is interesting, since he clearly didn't always feel that way.  He was reportedly ""enthusiastic"" back in the '80s when he first sold the film rights to ""Watchmen.""  If it wasn't unfilmable then, why would it be now?  Moore seems to have lost the ability to tell the difference between a bad storytelling medium, and a good storytelling medium badly employed, and now his disappointment has fermented into petulance.  It's really a shame, because a movie adaptation of his work has finally done it justice.  It's far from perfect, and no doubt even if this exact movie could have been made back when he still had enthusiasm for the project, he'd disagree with some of the director's decisions.  But as it is, he's ironically decided to turn his back on films only when at last someone's done a film adaptation of his work that he might actually have liked.  Pity.  It's his loss.

This really is a good film.  It's about as faithful to the graphic novel as a film could possibly be, given the changes that have to be made to adapt it into a movie, and keep the movie to a reasonable run time that audiences will be able to sit through.  The cast is nearly perfect.  All of the actors turn in solid performances, and Jackie Earl Haley and Jeffrey Dean Morgan really stand out in their roles.  Their performances are two of the reasons this is such a good adaptation.  The audience ends up perceiving the characters in precisely the same way they came across in the graphic novel.  In the comedian's case, we see an amoral, sometimes vicious man, and yet strangely, while never approving of him, don't quite hate him the way we ought to hate someone who has done the things he has.  In Rorschach, who seems to be the most popular character in both the graphic novel and the movie, we see a character who maintains a very black/white view of the world and the moral choices it presents us, and who is totally uncompromising and true to his beliefs, even to the point of being willing to die for them rather than compromising.  Perhaps this level of integrity and moral courage, as well as pure, unflinching toughness, is what causes people to like a character who is anti-social and violent, and more than a little crazy.  The other characters are almost as well done, but those two really stand out.  Once again, despite the changes made to bring this story to film, Moore really ought to get off his high horse and enjoy the movie for what it is, which is, on the whole, a faithful, respectful adaptation, which keeps the story and its themes fully intact, even if some of the details have to be changed for the medium.

Not everything is translated faithfully from the source material, however.  The ending is significantly altered, but this is not a change which seems to hurt the film at all.  In fact a considerable body of opinion exists that it actually improved the story.

But nothing is perfect, and the ""Watchmen"" movie is no exception.  Other changes, though more minor, are not so beneficial.  One example of this is the extreme, brutally graphic violence of some of the scenes.  Dan and Laurie's fight with the gang of muggers in the alley is a lot bloodier than in the book.  And in the director's cut, the assassination attempt on Veidt in his office is a LOT more brutal.  In the novel, we see a gunman step into view, fire at Veidt, and hit his secretary with one shot, and she falls over dead.  In the director's cut of the movie, she gets his twice twice, in super slo mo, with close ups on the impacts, one of which takes off several fingers of her right hand.  Then another bullet hits Lee Iacocca right between the eyes (and he wasn't even in the book).  And for the life of me, I can't see any way in which all this extra carnage improves the story one jot.  It adds nothing whatsoever to the story.  And speaking of the scene with Iacocca, the insertion of him into this movie, in a scene where he and several other corporate CEOs confront Veidt is by far the worst scene in the movie.  It's such a hamfisted, childish caricature of the evil rich capitalist fat cat, right down to one of the sinister plutocrats sneering ""Free energy?  Free's just another word for for socialist.  We may just have to look into some of your past associations.""  It comes across as just what it is, a Hollywood liberal's fantasy of what a rich conservative corporate executive is.  And again, it adds nothing to the story.  More minor flaws include Snyder's trademark overuse of slow motion, and Silk Spectre's magic boots, which are stiletto-heeled in any scene where she's just walking or standing, but flat-heeled when she fights bad guys.

Still the flaws are fairly minor.  And I suppose they -- the consequence of having Zack Snyder as director -- are the price we must pay for the good fortune of having Zack Snyder as a director.  It was probably inevitable that he would insert such things into the movie, but he was also one of the only directors who appreciated the the original story enough to keep the changes minor, and stay as faithful to the novel as he did.  The result is a great movie, which can be enjoyed even by people who never read the graphic novel, but which will also please the novels longtime and devoted fans.",1248393600,3,6433,4.622907488986784
3578827,3,B001FB55H6,"I have to say the movie itself is 5 stars, but the ""Director's Cut"" packaged here is worth only three.  Basically if you're a casual ""Watchmen"" fan then you're better off with the shorter (and cheaper) theatrical cut of the movie.  If you're a rabid fan then wait until December when the ultimate edition with the ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" woven in is released.  This ""director's cut"" edition then really falls in the middle and serves little purpose unless you've got money to burn and need to have every edition of the movie.

The extra 24 minutes of footage are OK, but most of it wasn't necessary.  The death of Hollis Mason (not a spoiler if you've read the book) seems pointless and distracting and the motivation for it is hazy at best.  The only other real scene is Laurie--Silk Spectre II--breaking out of Rockefeller Base to stay with Dan--Nite Owl II.  It's not really adding anything critical to the plot.  Rorshach dealing with cops in the Comedian's apartment wasn't necessary either.  (It's like in ""Star Wars"" films where they have all those pointless shots of ships flying into or out of ports; we don't care HOW they get to or from there, only that they do!)  Similarly, shots firing on Archie after the prison break don't add anything.  I thought the most interesting addition was the brief scene after Rorshach meets with Dan where he goes on to himself about why he has to investigate the Comedian's death.  This ties nicely to the later scene in Antarctica.

One plot hole not solved for me in this edition is:  where does Silk Spectre II get the gun she shoots Ozymandias with in Antarctica?  Maybe someone can clear that up for me.  Does he just keep guns lying around for her to find or did she always have one and not use it?

So, again, unless you can't wait until December or you're as obsessive as Rorschach when it comes to collecting ""Watchmen"" stuff then you might as well wait.

3578839,3,B001FB55H6,"i got done watching this movie only twenty minutes ago.i was so moved by it,i rushed right to my dinosaur computer and put forth this review.
  i thought this movie was going to be a stupid x-men rip off.it was however not that at all.whoever wrote and directed this movie will sink to any low.there is no line that they will not cross.there is rape,a pregnant woman being executed,a 6 year old girl being mutilated and fed to dogs and thats just the worst stuff.this movie is very graphic and very detailed.i think i have a very good stomach for movie violence but this is just sick! not to mention the rape victim continualy says she didn't mind.its beyond what should be allowed.i know that goes against the first ammendment but this hollywood crap asks once again ""were they right?""

ok,that off my chest,the movie was a secret society type movie.i hate it when the movie is very secretive and stuff until the end.i mean why advertise it as a comic book movie at all?why not ""mystery""?then we would know we will sit through 90 plus minutes of questions and 5 minutes of confusing answers.
also,the super heroes weren't even in thier prime ,they were all old.it was like a million dollar version of mermaid man and barnacle boy from sponge bob.it had that 1920s jazzy feel to it.
now,the super heroes are viewed as the bad guys in this one.they were brutal and the enforcers and it pissed people off.
the 2 biggest losers in the whole movie are those who survive too.that was no good.of course i cant say who here.
this one guy called ""comedian"" was played by wayne gayle from ""natural born killers"".he was a very nuerotic wanna be cop gone tv parasite in that movie.i don't care if he is iron man or comedian or who .he is always going to be that dorky talk show guy.
but,there were some good points.the ""smartest man in the world"",was a great character.and dr manhatten was one of the coolest characters of all time even though he seems like a silver surfer rip off only he teleports.he is way cooler than silver surfer though.his ho-bag girl friend sais something like ""everthing is quantum mechanics and alternate universes with this guy"".its cool to see that they took a genius and made him cool.
the special effects were both good and bad.the nuclear holocaust was less than stellar.most of the stuff with dr manhatten was awesome! but,the violence was either cool stuff we wanted to see as pre teens like knees getting snapped and the bone coming out OR was totaly gross,way too much information and just gross!
so thats why i gave it a 3 star rating.the awesome stuff is 5 star quality.the bad stuff was 1 star quality.[i couldn't give it less].so theres your average!",1248393600,,2679,4.612159329140461

The special features are great and the Maximum Movie Mode feature is incredible.

Only the blu-ray technology offers these amazing features and the future of viewing movies at home is looking very bright thanks to blu-ray.

3578841,3,B001FB55H6,"Nothing need be said about the origins of this film. In this review I've decided not to focus on comparisons to the graphic novel but simply on the film itself. It's an interesting mix of good and not so good elements. Here's the not so good:

1. Poor choice of background tracks to many scenes. Some of the songs kill the experience flat and give you '80's cringe.

2. Ultra gore in some scenes feels like it belongs in a different movie and may create a feeling of distaste for some viewers.

3. This is a stripped-down version of a 5-disc release coming later in the year (think Hellboy) and the extras are very weak. More studio double-dipping.

4. Make-up and acting of key political figures is below bar with that of the main characters to the point of pure caricature. Nixon is the worst offender - his extended nose makeup is so overdone that his scenes seem like they belong more in an episode of ""Saturday Night Live.""

5. Image quality on the DVD itself could have been better in parts: In large areas of flat color some MPEG artifacting or blurriness is evident. Please note: I am not reviewing the Blu-ray version.

6. Explanatory dialogue ending is a little confused and cliched.

The good elements would have to include:

1. Good direction, cinematography, art direction, editing, and costume design.
2. Good acting from the main leads.
3. Entertainment value.

All other credit would have to go to the original graphic novel creators: It's their vision and storytelling we are seeing up on the screen. The director should be commended for remaining faithful to their vision.

This could have been a 5 star DVD if the studio hadn't been so greedy, had stronger quality control, and the director had made some slightly different decisions along the way and in post-production.",1248393600,4,1790,4.726688102893891
3578842,5,B001FB55H6,"300's Zack Snyder brings Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' critically acclaimed comic book Watchmen to the big screen, courtesy of DC Comics and Warner Bros. Pictures. Set in an alternate universe circa 1985, the film's world is a highly unstable one where a nuclear war is imminent between America and Russia. Superheroes have long been made to hang up their tights thanks to the government-sponsored Keene Act, but that all changes with the death of The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a robust ex-hero commando whose mysterious free fall out a window perks the interest of one of the country's last remaining vigilantes, Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley). His investigation leads him to caution many of his other former costumed colleagues, including Dr. Manhattan, Night Owl (Patrick Wilson), Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), Sally Jupiter (Carla Gugino), and her daughter, The Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman). Heralded for bringing the world of superheroes into the literary world, Watchmen gave the super-powered mythos a real-life grounding that had been missing in mainstream comics to that point. The film adaptation had languished in one form of development hell or another for years after the book's release, with various directors on and off the project, including Terry Gilliam, David Hayter, and Darren Aronofsky, as well as Paul Greengrass, whose eventual dismissal stemmed from budget conflicts with the studio.",1248393600,2,1411,5.418181818181818

The story line was not only engaging it was nearly the perfect balance of action and character development.  I was rooted until the credits rolled.

The sound track was an added bonus, I particularly liked the Philip Glass Ensemble.  Each track was a nice accent to the scene it was associated with.

I can also appreciate how this was viewed as revolutionary in its day.  To see the other side of your heroes, to know that there is a very thin line that separates them from us.  To see their weakness, their subtle genius and the daily uncompromising struggle to keep evil at bay.

I was genuinely surprised not only at the ending, but the outlook the heroes took.

As for the picture and audio.  Incredible.  The teleportation scenes the sound of crashing glass, I haven't been this blown away in a long time.

My only regret is that we probably will never see a sequel to the unmakeable movie.

As for my favorite character; it's a toss up between Rorschach and Dr. Manhattan.  No regrets from my purchase.

3578877,5,B001FB55H6,"I am a 49 year old artist and cartoonist. There are only 4 graphic novels that hold a place of honor amongst the dusky confines of my towering alchemical library. THE DARKNIGHT, THE CROW, V FOR VENDETTA, and WATCHMEN. My anthology of the WATCHMEN comics is a Limited Edition Hardbound Original that was purchased upon its publication as a novel from the Sci Fi Book Club back in the 80s. I have not read the novel in many years. I felt that maybe I should before viewing the film. But, I'm grateful that I did not. I wanted a fresh perspective on the story and the film. And, I felt that reading the novel again might provide too much distraction with detailed comparisons in the differences between the novel and the film. I wanted Zack Synder's WATCHMEN to wash over me as a stand alone piece of art, so that I might fairly assess its narrative power as a film. And wash over me it did. Like a bloody mushroom cloud!

This film packs a visceral one-two punch. I don't remember the novel making quite the same impression on me. (I'm skimming thru the novel again for the first time in over ten years.) To be fair, film is a more visually impressive medium to begin with. So, comparisons to the value of a film over its graphic source is rather moot IMO. Both should be judged under different aesthetic guidelines. Both the novel and the film are INCREDIBLE pieces of work!

Why Alan Moore refused to include his name on the credits of WATCHMEN, as well as The Wachowskis' brilliant retelling of V FOR VENDETTA, is beyond me. For the second time Moore's work has received a masterful treatment on the themes and philosophical overtones of his fictional sensibilities. This film is just as thoughtfully and lovingly crafted as was V FOR VENDETTA. I think that Moore owes these filmmakers his gratitude instead of any derision or scorn that he may have directed at these films. Two of humanity's most important literary achievements have now become important literary films. I know of only 3 that have never strayed far from the author's original intent. All are based on graphic novels. The above mentioned graphic novels, and Frank Miller's 300. (Although a great film, I felt the DARK KNIGHT strayed wildly from the novel.) Score TWO great graphic novel films for Zack Synder. Nice work, Zack! Another gorgeous comic book brought to stunning realization! It is fairly obvious that a filmmaker that choses to film a graphic novel already has a storyboard to work from. Conceptualization is already realized in the form of the artistically rendered panels of the novel. The visual style of the author's storytelling language is already in place. This is probably why these films work so well. And this film works gangbusters!

Beautiful production design, costumes, and special effects. (Be aware, the film violence is far more graphic than the novel's.)

The performances are flawless. Especially Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. Holy Dark Night of The Soul, Batman, is this a powerful performance! Pitch Perfect! Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan is wonderfully bored, stoic, and reserved. And, Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian is all too human and entirely out of control. A wonderful job by the rest of this great cast.

What is not touched on enough about Moore's stories, that have been made into films, are the very themes that confront us RIGHT NOW as human beings living on this planet. V FOR VENDETTA and WATCHMEN are filled with far more philosophical questions, than answers. Moore's warnings about a harsh reality looming in our near future were penned way back in the 80s. They are now clobbering us right in the kisser. Time is running out for this world. (Symbolized by the watchmaker and the doomsday clock in WATCHMEN.) The abuse of power and technology, crime, terrorism, moral bankruptcy, dwindling energy and natural resources, corporate control, push button annihilation, and the unstoppable cause and effect juggernaut of man's self-destructive nature. Is conservative libertarian vigilance justification for anarchy or the death of innocents? Do the needs and rights of the many outweigh the needs and rights of the few? ""Moral ambiguities."" (This was the original title of my review until I saw it flash across the screen in the Special Features Section. Apparently, I drew the only conclusion that Moore and the filmmakers intended me to have. Bravo!) If you want to make an omelet, you have to break a few eggs. Or do you? Do the few, with power over the many, have the right to decide who lives and who dies on a planet that is living on borrowed time? Everyone will draw a different philosophical conclusion for themselves after being confronted with the moral questions posed by the brilliant WATCHMEN. (and Moore's V FOR VENDETTA.) Personally, I think that I side with Rorschach. I find it frightening to live in a world where the powerful few, have so much control over my destiny, and, where the masses are dissolving into one ugly self-serving carnivorous beast. Who's side are you on?

WATCHMEN is heady, mature, violent, and tendentious stuff! A great great film based on a great great novel!

My advice to those that have not read the novel: do the contrary. See the film, then read the novel.

3578878,4,B001FB55H6,"This review is written specifically for the 2-Disc Director's Cut DVD. Further, I have not read the original graphic novel, so this review refers to only the film - there are no fan-boy blinders on over here!

The first ten minutes of ""Watchmen"" suggested that I was about to see one of the lasting classics of this decade. The opening fight sequence was unlike anything in recent memory. Within the realm of superhero battles, this one ranks right up there with some of the fight scenes in The Dark Knight and 300. The scope isn't epic, in the sense that it all takes place within a high-rise apartment living room, but the choreography is fantastic. The property damage is rendered incredibly well to boot, things like fists through walls and heads through countertops - it's all here! After this, perhaps the most technically impressive credits sequence I've ever seen begins. Set to the tune of the Bob Dylan classic ""The Times They Are a-Changin"", the sequence displays many historical events (such as the Kennedy assassination) and indicates how superheros played roles in them. The scenes are rendered in very stylish, often slow-motion sequences. This effect is also used in the fight scenes as well. Some seem to find this grating, but I'm a major fan of this technique. Slow motion lends a battle that classic Peckinpah-esque gritty brutality, and it's used to spectacular effect in ""Watchmen"". Unfortunately, despite these incredible opening scenes, ""Watchmen"" spirals into mediocrity before finally finding a clumsy footing in the climax of the film.

First of all, a word about the soundtrack. Often the film chooses brilliant compositions that fit the material here, such as the aforementioned Dylan track and a great use of the intro to ""99 Luftballons"" by Nena. Simon & Garfunkel's ""Sounds of Silence"" plays during a funeral sequence and the megahit Hendrix cover of ""All Along the Watchtower"" plays near the climax and they seem to fit rather well (though the use of both is a bit hackneyed). The major failing in the film's licensed tracks is when it attempts to be ironic. For instance, the use of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" during a bizarre love sequence between Nite Owl II and Silk Spectre aboard the airship ""Archie"". Archie, by the way, is a retro-styled throwback to the golden age of comics. It's a great setpiece, as it marries the nod to nostalgia with a fun design that cleverly mimicks the appearance of an owl. But, I digress. The love scene is already bizarre enough, and with the use of an overplayed, arguably mediocre song that's supposedly meant to indicate loss or longing - you have the makings of an epic fail. Equally as weak is the attempt to weave Nat King Cole's ""Unforgettable"" with the opening fight scene. When done well, this sort of technique is reasonably enjoyable, the combination of a beautiful composition with a horrific event. This, however, feels contrived and unconvincing. The score, for its part, did not detract from the film but was certainly nothing especially memorable.

The chief plotting failure of ""Watchmen"" is that, for a film with a myriad of interesting characters, there is far too much time spent on Nite Owl II and Silk Spectre - who are perhaps the least interesting heroes in the bunch. Most notably, there's painstaking detail devoted to their tepid love affair, which seems to be born out of convenience rather than passion. This creates a classic superhero love triangle because it's carried on to the chagrin of the much more fascinating naked blue guy. Sorry, I mean Doctor Manhattan. He barely pays any mind to Silk Spectre, which is most humorously illustrated during a love scene where there are two or three naked blue versions of himself caressing her (yeah, it's as weird as it sounds) while the 'real' Doctor Manhattan is actually deep in his work. Curiously, he seems puzzled by her unhappiness with respect to his lack of attention. I guess his supreme intellect causes him to be beneath the primitive sentiments of a mere mortal woman. Seriously, what's with this guy? In public he wears a fine tailored suit and occasionally he'll wear a tight high-rise speedo, but he spends the bulk of the movie walking around completely naked replete with a luminous penis swinging between his legs. I guess he's so advanced even clothing has little meaning to his towering intellect.

Rorschach is perhaps the second most-represented hero here, and is also perhaps the most interesting aside from The Comedian. He's perfected the angsty-growl speech affectations and makes a grand anti-hero. Rorschach is an engrossing, complex character because he often blurs the line between right and wrong, though he clearly considers himself a savior of humanity. His penchant for stark brutality clashes strongly with the more conventional heroic attributes of Nite Owl II. The Comedian, mostly seen in flashback, was perhaps my favorite hero presented here. Much like Rorschach, he often cannot fully decide if he's good or bad, but there is unquestionably more evil in him than good (he murders a pregnant woman carrying his own child).

Ozymandias could've been just as complex, if not more, but far too little detail was devoted to his character. I never felt truly engaged by his motivations and his explanations only brought up more questions. I expected the ""Director's Cut"" to shed more light on this character, considering it adds around twenty-four minutes, but he remains as equally inscrutable as in the theatrical version. Speaking of which, I do not consider the Director's Cut the ""definitive"" version. The bulk of the new material isn't particularly interesting and merely adds to the running time which was already pushing three hours. The only reason I'm pleased I selected the Director's Cut is because one of my favorite scenes is included in it. In the middle of the film an elderly hero is attacked by a gang of thugs and as he's struggling with them he imagines himself punching the villians of his youth. It's a very artful, crushing scene - particularly for a character we've only seen a handful of minutes of up until that point.

For a title that bills itself as a ""Special Edition"", the special features are shockingly scant, but I suppose they're saving everything for the 5-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition coming in December. Of course, I was wholly unaware this was in the works until I saw the flier inserted into the DVD case, which offers $10 off if you sign up to receive email spam from them. Gee, thanks WB, aren't you guys swell? As always, the almighty double-dip wins again. According to the flier, the 5-Disc edition is supposed to contain an even more extended version of the film with ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" woven in, a commentary track, the complete Watchmen comics, and over two hours of bonus content including Hollis Mason's tell-all ""Under the Hood"" (whatever that is). ""Tales of the Black Freighter"", I understand, has already been released as an animated feature along with the ""Under the Hood"" segment as a special feature. This doesn't sound like must-have material, it seems to be for hardcore fans alone.

The special features included here are a fairly entertaining half-hour featurette on the impact of the comic and 11 ""Watchmen Video Journals"". These are extremely brief (3-5 minute) promotional videos that cover small aspects of the film's making. If they sound uninteresting, let me assure you that yes - they're entirely worthless. The DVD case says you can ""immerse"" yourself in them, but a more accurate reaction would be to ""glance briefly"" at them. If the clips had been edited together, I might have a slightly more positive slant on this, but ultimately this is something they slapped on the DVD simply to have something there. Honestly, I'd rather have a gallery of the trailers than these so-called ""journals"". To top it all off there's a bloody awful music video by My Chemical Romance butchering the Dylan classic ""Desolation Row"". That is something strictly for the pre-teens, who probably shouldn't be watching this film anyway. I think I hardly need point out that this is a poor excuse for a 2-Disc ""Special Edition"".

""Watchmen"" is a technical triumph in many ways, from the clever and innovative opening credit sequence to the ultra high-intensity fight scenes, but the end product is mired in a web of great ideas that never seem to be fully fleshed out. The film has a lot to say, yet cannot seem to figure out how to articulate them, aside from a few painfully obvious observations on human nature. What focused my attention on this film, prior to seeing it, was that many reviewers were commenting on the ""complex narrative structure"" and that it was occasionally difficult to follow. I must say, though, if ""Watchmen"" is what American audiences consider a ""complex narrative"", then I lament our intellectual downfall. There are no weighty explorations of the human psyche here and there is no complex path the characters weave, it's a by-the-numbers superhero film with an excitingly dark tint and a handful of fresh ideas. For those who have not yet seen the film, I highly suggest a rental prior to purchase.

One final note: I must tip my hat to the filmmakers for some clever visual references to da Vinci's The Last Supper and the classic films Dr. Strangelove and Gunga Din (among other things). I greatly enjoy small flourishes such as these, as they add a lot to the atmosphere, and I'm particularly not accustomed to seeing things like this in a superhero film.",1248307200,6,9535,4.9321295143212955
3578879,5,B001FB55H6,"Movie was amazing. That's all you need to know.

3578880,5,B001FB55H6,"I am not a fanboy of the Watchmen graphic novel, and I really had no clue what to expect from this movie when I rented it a few days ago.  This film never caught my attention well enough to move me to see it in theaters, but I thought I would give it a shot on rental.  One thing that is clear from the beginning is that this is no ordinary superhero comic story.  The characters inhabiting the role of a ""hero"" in this film are real people who are dealing with various inner demons.  It is this quality in the character development that grabbed my attention and caused me to feel for what these people have gone through.  Having not seen the original theatrical release, I can't respond to what new footage has been added to the director's cut.  What I can say is that I quickly fell in love with this story and could really empathize with the characters and all of their flaws.  Most other superhero stories have characters who don't seem to live a 'normal' life.  That is not the case here.  Each character in this story has an interesting backstory that fleshes them out and makes them appealing to the viewer.  This is more than a story about comic book heros, it's a story of how people with superhuman capabilities have dealt with problems in their lives, and how it has affected them years down the road.

The one thing I wanted to bring to the reader's attention is the Maximum Movie Mode feature exclusive to Blu-ray.  While it may not be the most creative name for a BD feature, it has got to be the coolest thing I have seen yet on any BD title.  This is no mere Picture-in-picture feature.  The director Zach Snyder will periodically pop in to comment on the action on the screen.  When he does this, the movie screen moves to the left side, a new pop up screen appears on the right, and the director interacts with the two pointing out interesting details.  This feature incorporates storyboards, comic comparisons, making-of clips, and a timeline contrasting events in our history to events as they appear in the alternate reality of Watchmen.  I've seen other pic-in-pic features before, some good and some not so good, but I have never seen one as informative and enjoyable as this one.  Having the director of the film right there to actually point to images on the screen and give his take on what was happening is a treat for any film buff.  This special feature alone moved me to go out and buy the disc in order to be able to thoroughly enjoy every aspect of the Maximum Movie Mode.  I hope that other studios will pay attention to what Mr. Snyder and Warner have done with Blu-ray technology.  It's features like this that really show what BD can do that you just can't mimic on a DVD.",1248307200,,2708,4.430303030303031
3578881,3,B001FB55H6,"For those of us that own the format with a solid A/V set up, I was expecting a reference quality disc that would better serve a story that was simply too big for a 2 hour movie; not to mention this was the guy that did 300. The Blue Ray exceeded my expectations in some areas and fails in others.

From a feature standpoint, watching Zak Snyder explain everything is awesome and I'd love to see some of the more colorful directors in Hollywood do the same (Tarantino on Kill Bill's action sequences comes to mind). It's a great use of the format and not possible on standard DVD format. There are some additional featurettes that are also worth watching and a digital copy for travel on the laptop. The extra 25 minutes should have been in the theatrical version as it only adds to each of the characters that get more screen time.  5/ 5 stars for extras.

From a sound and video standpoint, it's okay, not great. The Dark Knight not only set the bar for comic based movies, but for Blu Ray as well with reference quality scenes scattered throughout. Although shown in IMAX, scenes were not filmed in IMAX, so this is a straight forward transfer. Zak Snyder's imagery is amazing, but as far as the transfer goes, it's not as good as the Dark Knight or even Snyder's own 300. The explosions and action will rock your system and soundtrack is dynamite. It does suffer from very quiet dialogue Don't get me wrong, it looks and sounds good, just not as good as I was expecting. 3 / 5 stars.

I'll comment on the movie as well. I'm a fan of the graphic novel and I appreciate the scene for scene recreation. BUT. ..I am one of the many who felt like this was too big for the theater. Had this been a 5 part miniseries, or maybe 8 part with the Black Freighter mixed in, I think it would have been better. If HBO could get the Sookie Stackhouse novels done, why not Watchmen? Some of the depth is just missing, making the movie feel cold and heartless. I also thought that the movie was terribly cast. I have no problem with the casting of B level actors or smaller names (Brandon Routh as Superman or Heath Ledger as the Joker).  Rorshack, Dr. Manhatten and The Comedian were great. Daniel was okay, but Laurie and Ozzy were just terrible. The movie hinged on the chemistry between Daniel and Laurie to give the movie an emotional connection and it's never there. The graphic novel depicted Ozzymandais as a big, strong, charismatic genius, not a bean pole whose mask was wider than his head. The movie just has no soul and feels empty. 2.5/5 stars for looking and sounding great, but having very uneven performances.",1248307200,,2612,4.444676409185804
3578882,5,B001FB55H6,"They year 1986 was a watershed year for comic books. It was the year that people started taking comic books seriously as a form of literature. The reason? Alan Moore's Watchmen (along with Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns) introduced readers to superheroes with real problems. This was a vast departure from the the years of the kid-friendly Super Friends and the campy Adam West Batman television series.

When Watchmen hit, that all changed. Hailed for its deconstruction and examination of superhero tropes, it won a Hugo Award in 1988 and it is the only graphic novel to be listed by Time as one of the 100 greatest novels of the 20th century.

Naturally, Hollywood wanted in on the action, and attempts to make a Watchmen movie have continued since its publication. However, they were never able to crack the Watchmen nut. How do you take such a layered, complex book like Watchmen and turn it into a two-hour movie? How much would the material need to be changed? What elements would need to be left out? Many concepts were pitched - making it a buddy film centered on Rorschach and Nite-Owl, getting rid of crucial characters, setting the film in a contemporary setting instead of the 80's, the list goes on. Several directors were involved. After attempting to make his own Watchmen movie, Paul Greengrass ultimately deemed Watchmen ""unfilmable.""

But Zack Snyder, who had just come off the huge success of directing another graphic novel adaptation with 300, stepped forward and was given the task to film the unfilmable. Using the graphic novel itself as the film's storyboard, Snyder succeeded. His Watchmen film is as faithful to the graphic novel as you can expect. The Comedian is still a cynic who takes pleasure in his violent ""crimebusting"", Rorschach is still a brutal vigilante who sees everything in black-and-white morality (and is played with fury and intensity by a resurgent Jackie Earle Haley in the film's standout performance), Nite-Owl still can't ""get it up"" without being in his superhero costume, and Dr. Manhattan is still as naked as a jaybird and apathetic to the plight of humanity.

Most of the film's departures from the graphic novel are understandable. The graphic novel's out-of-deep-left-field finale involving a cataclysmic event is altered, though the goals and motives behind it are unchanged. This new ending actually makes more sense and ties to the characters much better, but it still doesn't quite have the gut-punch shock that the book's end had. Perhaps this has more to do with the fact that Snyder is forced to cram as much into the film as possible while trying to keep the film's runtime from getting too long that the audience isn't given much time to really absorb it.

Another element that Snyder has included in this film is moments of horror-movie gore that almost seem out of place. Perhaps the book's violence lends itself to a very violent film interpretation, but I felt Snyder (who directed the remake of George Romero's Dawn of the Dead) may have gone overboard during a few moments, like Nite-Owl breaking a thug's arm to the point that the bones burst through the flesh. Ouch.

The Director's Cut adds nearly a half an hour of footage that Snyder was forced to cut to keep the film under three hours. Most of this footage comes in the form of lengthened scenes. In one, Rorschach's investigation of The Comedian's apartment is interrupted by the police and a fight ensues, and Rorschach's questioning by Dr. Malcolm is longer. Hollis Mason's sad and brutal death at the hands of a street gang is also reinserted in the Director's Cut, a scene I was disappointed to hear that it was omitted from the theatrical version.

This version of the Blu-Ray comes with a handful of featurettes that reflect on the graphic novel's impact on comic books. Another examines the psychology and cultural impact of actual vigilantes like New York's Guardian Angels, Bernard Goetz, as well as the recent trend of ""real life superheroes"" who dress up in costume and patrol their neighborhoods. One featurette even delves into the real scientific basis behind the elements of the Watchmen world.

For me, the best feature would have to be the special commentary performed by Zack Snyder himself, who will step in during the film and explain aspects of the film's production as opposed to just giving a voice-only commentary. Then the audience has the option to view a vignette about that aspect of the film or continue watching the film.

This Amazon-exclusive version of Watchmen: Director's Cut comes in a replica of the Owlship, Nite-Owl's hovering vehicle, which emits lights and sounds with the press of a button. The Owlship itself can be removed from its base, and I'm sure your kids would like to run around the house with the Owlship in their hands pretending it can fly (note: Watchmen is an R-rated film and NOT for children, but i'm sure kids will still get a kick out of playing with the Owlship).

There is a Digital Copy for your computers and iPods, but I was disappointed to find that it is of the theatrical version and NOT the Director's Cut.

There is an ""Ultimate Edition"" of Watchmen being released around Christmas, which will include the animated ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" feature spliced into the film as it appears in the graphic novel, so if you want a copy of Watchmen: DIrector's Cut that will give you the most bang for your buck until it comes out, the Amazon-exclusive Owlship version is probably the best way to go.",1248307200,14,5507,4.847872340425532
3578883,3,B001FB55H6,"When the Watchmen movie came out it a lot of fans of the graphic novel that spawned it said that to appreciate the movie it was better to have already read the novel. Movies need to stand on their own, they can't rely on source material to fill in the blanks of plot or characterization. But that seems an excuse, because that's not what's happening here. I think The Watchmen tries to tell too many stories at one time.

The Watchmen follows Rorschach, Jackie Earle Haley who plays a very convincing psychopathic super hero detective. He's trying to solve the murder of The Comedian (Jeffery Dean Morgan), one of the original Watchmen, superhero's from the 40's. We follow him through plot and subplot of a post-modern 1985 where Richard Nixon is running for his fifth term as President of U. S. and the world teeters on the edge of nuclear destruction. And we meet Watchmen old and new, Carla Cugino who plays Sally Jupiter who was the Watchman Silk Spectre in the 40's who was almost raped by The Comedian and now lives out her days in an alcoholic fog her memories of the past getting brighter with each passing day. Then there's Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode) billionaire, worlds smartest man and the hero Ozymandis with an Alexander the Great complex. And there's the love interest of Silk Spectre II/Laurie Jupiter played by the VERY attractive Malin Akerman and Nite Owl II whose day name is Dan Dreiberg (Patrick Wilson). Unfortunately, these two have no chemistry, their love scene seemed superfluous, and I really couldn't believe the flabby, nearsighted Dan Dreiberg could be any kind of super hero by night.

Besides the already mentioned performance of Jackie Earle Haley, Billy Crudup submerges himself into Dr. Manhattan, there are a lot of special effects surrounding Crudup's performance in this but I think it is an outstanding low key performance. Of course  Manhattan is a man whose humanity is submerging as his powers set him farther and farther away from anyone, let alone anyone who loves him.

Watchmen also grapples with a lot issues such as, does God exist? The nature of man? And the contradiction of love in the world. When the Watchmen aren't grappling with the nature of good and evil they're usually illustrating the dark side of man's nature, including the sympathetic Dr. Manhattan who does some very nasty things to people. Of course it can be argued in his case human beings are becoming inconsequential to him as he sees the macro picture. The sense of humor in the Watchmen is wicked, Richard Nixon's fifth term in office?

Sin City grappled with some of the same themes, a movie that came from graphic novel with devastatingly flawed hero's who aren't even sure they are hero's until push comes to shove. But Sin City didn't try to squeeze in the whole series of novels instead they picked and chose among the major tales for a slightly episodic feeling movie that in the end tied up the stories nicely. The Watchmen doesn't hold together as cohesively and in a place or two drops the thread.

If you're looking for a superhero movie for your kids, this isn't it. There's a lot of masochistic (albeit cartoonish) violence, and the Watchmen have very flawed and compromised personalities, this is definitely not for younger children. And as for adults or anyone interested in seeing the Watchmen it's definitely a rental.",1248307200,6,3358,4.811091854419411
3578884,4,B001FB55H6,"The 1985 graphic novel of Watchmen by comic book great Alan Moore is one of the most impressionable pieces of literature that I've read in years. And Zack Snyder's movie interpretation is one of the few films that I've ever seen that kept so closely true to the book.

Is Watchmen a movie about superheroes? Actually, I believe that the characters prefer ""costumed adventurers"" instead of superheroes...with the exception of one character in particular. The difference between superhero and costumed adventurer here is the difference between super-powers and plain old bravery and smarts. And just plain old bravery and smarts can't protect you from a bullet or a stronger man (or woman).

So when one of the approximately five still practicing costumed adventurers called The Comedian is murdered, Rorschach, a tough, shifting-ink-blot mask wearing anti-hero makes it his business to find the killer and warn the other adventurers of a villain potentially bent on getting rid of the remaining ""masks"".

I mentioned earlier ""an exception"" to the costumed versus super-powered adventurers...that exception is Dr. Manhattan. The question is not what can Dr. Manhattan do that's so special; the question is, what can't he do? So with a guy like Manhattan on your side...whether it's literally ""your"" side or say ""your county's"" side, ya can't lose, right?

But what if Dr. Manhattan decided to skip town for a while? Yeah. Exactly. You guessed it. Like if Tiger Woods left golf for a season due to injury...who'd watch golf anymore? Who'd watch the Watchmen?

I'd certainly recommend the novel over the movie, but what else is new? That's always the case with novels turned movies. The ending of the movie mirrors the novel with bit of a change and even makes a bit more sense as the twists and turns of a diabolical plot are unveiled. But as I said earlier, this minor alteration in the integrity of the story originally told by Alan Moore in graphic novel form does really not affect the brilliance of the original concept.

If you don't have the time for the novel, this 3-hour Director's Cut is a wonderful alternative...not just for comic book and graphic novels fans, but for fans of Truth, Justice and the American Way! Add this to your cart.",1248307200,7,2246,4.9442970822281165
3578885,5,B001FB55H6,"I have never read the graphic novel and most likely never will. I am just not into that art form, no offense to those who are, but I did want to see this film, mostly out of curiosity, so I rented it today and watched it.
From the beginning, it is clear they spared no expense in making this film. This is one gorgeous film to watch from the cinematography to the effects to the direction, I can find no fault.
The story is complex and layered, unlike any other superhero film I have seen. In fact, the closest would be The Dark Knight and even that is a simple film by comparison, fine though it is. I loved the parallel America idea, where things were just a little bit 'off' but still highly recognizable, a timeline where we had the super heroes and yet the realities of nuclear war were, ironically enough, even more likely. Clearly, the writers did not just throw this movie together and put a lot of thought into it.
The characters are almost too human and I mean that as a compliment. They make mistakes, they are an unusual mix of those who revel in killing to those who question their own morality and of course Dr. Manhattan, who is slowly losing any link to humanity. On the surface, they are the typical comic book heroes, dressed up in the funny costumes, posing for the pictures, looking like they are expected to look. From within, they are all battling demons, none more so than the contrasting darkness of time expiring juxtaposed to the time that once was, the time of youth, when everything was so much more alive, so much more colorful. I think the film does this very well.
It is a violent film and this more than anything caught me off guard. Sure, I noticed it was rated R but that did not fully prepare me for the amount and the intensity of the violence. I do think at times it did go a bit over the top and I could have done without a few of these scenes.
Going along with the R rating, these superheroes actually think about sex and engage in it, one a violent attempted rape and one a fairly explicit but tastefully done love scene.
The violence, the swearing, the sex. Tim Burton's Batman seems very very tame by comparison.
Some of the acting was a bit over the top but that is to be expected, I think, for the characters almost seem compelled to behave in a certain way contrary to who they really are. Comedian, for example, seemed to me as totally lost even though he came across to the other heroes as the most certain, the most grounded, the most realistic, even if it was viewed as cynical. I could go on about each as they all had their fascinating aspects but suffice to say I thought each character, each actor, did a very good job.
To sum up, I think Watchmen is a fascinating, exciting, atypical superhero film and an incredibly pleasant surprise.",1248220800,6,2789,4.375722543352601

3578933,4,B001FB55H6,"Based on Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons graphic novel, ""Watchmen"" works more often than not and although director Zack Snyder's film may not be perfect, it's an extremely good adaptation of that work capturing the essence of what made the graphic novel so good.

The ""Director's Cut"" of the film features 24+ minutes of additional and extended scenes. Some work such as the confrontation that Dr. Manhattan faces by reporters on a TV show while others such as the murder of an important supporting character suffers from weak dialogue and acting by the extras.

There are some minor artifacts but on the whole the film looks stunning on Blu-ray. The special features are quite nice introducing a unique one in particularly called ""Maximum Movie Mode"" that you quickly get the feeling will be over or misused by others. In ""Maximum Movie Mode"" you director Snyder appears on screen during certain scenes detailing how the scene was shot. You can also access production photos/comic book pages for a comparison/contrast between how the film was storyboarded vs. the final outcome. You can also see the actual shooting of the scene while watching it again be aware however that this isn't presented in a picture-in-picture mode. It does interrupt the film but you can quickly navigate back to the film itself. There's also an alternate ""Timeline"" with photos comparing our world to the world of ""Watchmen"". It's  marvelous special feature that could only be presented in Blu-ray because of the higher bit rate/capacity of the format.

***
The rest of the special features are located on disc two. We get a number of very good featurettes on the film itself from ""The Phenomenon: The Comic That Changed Comics"" which points out many of the innovative techniques, use of subtext and layering of the various stories that Moore & Gibbons used to present ""Watchmen"" back in the 80's to ""Real Super Heroes, Real Vigilantes"" which explores how the characters are mirrored in real life in our world.

""Mechanics: Technologies of a Fantastic World"" allows you to dig into the technology of ""Watchmen"" ranging from Dr. Manhattan's Martian get-away to Nite Owl's ship. We also get the 11 ""Watchmen"" video journals which were originally on-line as well as the video for the song ""Desolation Row"" by My Chemical Romance. There are also BD-Live features planned for the future. You can share many of your favorite special features via BD-Live through Facebook. Some of this material is a bit repetitive because of the visual commentary track that Snyder does.

We also get a third disc with a digital copy of the film and the code which is active for a limited time.""Watchmen"" had a long and painful birth--it went through director's, writers and producers more rapidly than a kid eating a candy bar. It's the 1980's and Richard Nixon serves out his third term as President. The U.S.won the Vietnam War due to the intervention of superhero Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup)and the other superheroes now banned by the government from intervening in the affairs of ordinary folks. When the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan)is murdered the vigilante hero Rorschah (Jackie Earl Haley in a marvelous performance)as he tries to discover who is trying to eliminate America's former heroes. He contacts his old partners Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson), Silk Spectre II aka Jupiter (Malin Akerman) and Ozymandis (Matthew Goode) to convince them that they need to band together to discover who wants to eliminate them.

""Watchmen"" may be flawed but Snyder's ambitious film overcomes many of those flaws by introducing a fascinating story filled with colorful, conflicted characters. One of the flaws of the film are some of the surface, shallow performances by the actors and part of that can be laid at the feet of director Snyder and his writers on the film. While many of them can't dig in underneath the surface of these characters and expose what's truly going, others such as Jackie Earle Haley, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Patrick Wilson, Carla Gugino as Silk Spectre's mother Sally Jupiter and Crudup as Dr. Manhattan reveal a significant amount of what drives their characters. Part of the issue is the film format itself which allows limited time and space to portray the same story that was told over many issues of the original comic book itself and part of that is that Snyder becomes so enamored with his visuals that he loses track of the very human element he's trying to portray. Still, flaws and all I doubt anyone else could have tackled ""Watcmen"" and succeeded as well as he has here. Producer Joel Silver who had the rights to produce an earlier version of the film (which would have starred Arnold) recently commented that he felt his version would be a better version of the film, more populist reaching a broader audience. What he fails to realize is that is precisely what would have watered down and ruined what was unique about ""Watchmen"". The fact that Snyder makes a relatively faithful, visually epic that nicely captures the flavor of the graphic novel IS an outstanding achievement worth noting regardless of the flaws.

3578934,5,B001FB55H6,"Very few 'superhero' comic books have been as intellectually engaging as Watchmen.  Zack Snyder deserves kudos for not only doing a great job of bringing the the graphic novel to life, but also for having the integrity as an artist to do it faithfully to the source material.  Watchmen could easily have been turned into a bastardized simplified movie for main stream audiences (which in all likelihood probably would have made for a bigger blockbuster success, potentially more well-received by the movie-going masses).  I'm glad Snyder had the conviction to make a legitimate Watchmen movie instead.

I hope that over time, the movie will get the appreciation and respect that it rightfully deserves.  Unfortunately, I think that the masses went into the theater expecting nothing more than a great popcorn/action flick.  Most people weren't prepared to pay close attention to a three hour long non-linear multifaceted plot that contemplates some pretty dark moral and philosophical issues.

As much as I enjoyed the movie in the theater, I also felt that some plot points were a bit rushed (despite the long run time) and the film felt disjointed at times.  Thankfully, the added material in this Director's cut does a lot to smooth out these kinks.  For the most part, the added material consists of extended scenes, with more dialogue.

SPOILER AHEAD...

The most significant completely ""new"" addition is the death of Hollis Mason, which really should have been kept in the theatrical version.

Although I've heard complaints that 'Tales of the Black Freighter' wasn't spliced into this Director's cut, I really think that the movie is better off without it.  Having already watched the Tales of the Black Freighter dvd, I think they did a great job with it, but its still better as a stand-alone.  It worked great in the context of the graphic novel, but would only be a confusing distraction in a movie that many people were already complaining was too long.  However, I do think it would've been great if 'Black Freighter' and 'Under the Hood' had been included as special features in the package.  Unfortunately they are not.

In summary, Watchmen is a can't-miss film, a brilliant adaptation and IMO, a great and under-appreciated accomplishment.  The Director's Cut includes some excellent added material that significantly enhances the film's continuity.",1248220800,2,2366,5.1171875

If there's one thing that really stood out for this viewer it was the feeling of nostalgia for a 1980s that might've been.  And the music choices were wonderful. Billy Crudup and Jackie Earle Haley are perfection in their parts, and each the opposite pole of the american hero myth.

3578969,5,B001FB55H6,"...though it's easy to understand the predicament of ""Watchmen."" For most movie-goers, the ultra-serious trailer that appeared before ""The Dark Knight"" was a first exposure. The commercials that soon hit airwaves weren't much different. What the advertising for ""Watchmen"" wasn't able to do was explain to people that, unlike ""The Dark Knight"", ""Watchmen"" is VERY much a comic book movie, and a parody of one at that. Understandably, many viewers left theaters that night scratching their heads, wondering what exactly it was they'd just spent the last three hours sitting through.

Snyder executes Moore's work almost flawlessly. Aside from the ending (which, BTW, is better than the comic book's disappointing one), ""Watchmen"" easily stands as one of the most accurately depicted comic book movies ever. The few omissions leave some viewers out in the cold- but Snyder is a genius at putting emphasis where it counts. A video that plays in the beginning under Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are A'Changing"" serves as both a credit roll and a history lesson for those not already familiar with the story's alternate setting. Snyder has also put Moore's political themes at the forefront: there's more Nixon scenes, as some well as some humorous and speculative cameos from the likes of Ronald Reagan, Fidel Castro, and Pat Buchanan.

And yet, the film is almost too short- even three hour long director's cut. As the scenes of the film progresses faithfully to the chapters of the book, with the storytelling focusing on one or maybe two characters at a time and their paths intertwining closer to the end, one gets the impression that Watchmen would have done much better as an eleven or twelve episode mini-series. But then, we wouldn't have the high-budget special effects and choreography that we do now, and those are two aspects of the movie that are worth noting because they're definitely top-notch.

The liberal intellegensia hate this movie, as their press has made quite clear, but that's because they haven't done their homework. Like so many viewers, critics have not been able to pinpoint its place as a parody. Viewers who expect Watchmen is some super series courtroom drama with masked adventurers playing polarized symbolizations of things like 'law and order' or 'chaos'- that is, people who expect they're getting something like ""The Dark Knight""- should approach the movie with more of an open mind. Those who accept it for what it is- a politically fueled dark comic book 'parody' with plenty of serious points as well as laughs- will like the film quite a bit more.",1248220800,5,2586,5.037383177570093

3578971,4,B001FB55H6,"It was with much trepidation that I approached Zack Snyder's adaptation of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon's graphic novel.  Having read the novel several years prior, it had exceeded all my expectations and floored me both intellectually and emotionally.  Zack Snyder had only done the 2004 remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""300,"" both of which had seemed to be serviceable-yet-shallow films.  And the trailer, which somewhat infamously referred to Snyder as ""the visionary director of '300,'"" gave off a vibe of slickness that seemed wholly out-of-sync with my perception of the novel.

When I finally saw the film, I was astonished.  My concerns about Snyder evaporated as Moore's intricately-woven tale spun out on the screen before me.  I loved Haley's Rorschach, Crudup's Manhattan, the dead-on look, and most importantly the apocalyptic tone that had been so absent from the trailer.  There were minor quibbles I had with some of the soundtrack choices and Malin Ackerman came across as wooden, but overall I was absolutely impressed with what Snyder had managed to pull off, and I was disappointed that the film didn't live up to the lofty box-office expectations.  I don't want to engage in a debate regarding the film's merits, but am merely presenting my reaction to my theatrical experience to provide context.

Newly released in a 186 minute director's cut, ""Watchmen"" is still a thing of beauty to behold.  Some 24 minutes of footage are added, though I only particularly noticed in a handful of places.  The most significant differences I felt in my viewing were the fate of Hollis Mason and a couple of new beats for Malin Ackerman's Silk Spectre (which seemed to improve her performance).  While I don't feel that the film was spectacularly enhanced with these additions, they do offer enough improvement for me to recommend the DC over the theatrical cut.  If you liked the theatrical cut, I can't see why you wouldn't prefer the DC, and if you were disappointed in the initial version, you may find yourself more placated by this newest version.

The image quality of the release seemed almost flawless on my 32"" Samsung, and sound was crisp with plenty of bass for the subwoofer.  I was somewhat disappointed by the rather paltry selection of special features, all of which are found on the second disc of the set:  a half-hour long retrospective on the legacy and intent of the graphic novel, a collection of web documentaries (totaling roughly another half hour) that were previously available on the film's website on various aspects of production, the absolutely worthless music video of the My Chemical Romance cover of ""Desolation Row,"" and the equally worthless ""digital copy.""  I am aware that the Blu-Ray has additional features, including an ""enhanced experience"" that functions as a commentary and a couple of other documentaries, and I find it unfortunate that WB is attempting to ""coerce"" buyers into upgrading in this way.  Luckily, the film is well-worth owning despite the underwhelming selection of features on this DVD release and a purchase is still highly recommended.

NOTE:  A 5-disc ""Ultimate Collector's Edition"" is scheduled for release in December with the half-hour ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" short integrated into the DC (for a running time of three-and-a-half hours), commentary with Snyder and Dave Gibbons, the ""Under the Hood"" and Complete Motion Comic included as extras, as well as other documentaries.  A $10 coupon for the UCE is included in the box, and it was announced back in January.  Personally, I don't feel that the animated short is going to fit in with the rest of the film all that well and am skeptical of purchasing the UCE, but I do believe that consumers have a right to be informed before making their purchase.",1248220800,5,3782,4.988853503184713
3578972,5,B001FB55H6,"Bought the Blu-Ray, it looks and sounds spectacular.  I love the movie, and the Director's cut, while it takes a little effort to sit all the way through (which is understandable, given the depth of the source material,) fleshes the movie out just enough without overstaying its welcome.

My only gripe is this:  I have always liked having the TRAILERS for the movies I buy on DVD and Blu-Ray to be available on the discs.  If they have all the space on the discs for extras, they can fit in the trailers.  If for no other reason than that I tend to show them to friends and family when we're trying to decide what movies to watch.  The Watchmen Blu-Ray doesn't include the trailers, and that's a real shame because Warners cut together an EXCEPTIONAL teaser trailer for this film.  It really should have been included on the disc.  Hopefully I'm not the only one arguing for the continuation of the original previews being included on DVDs and Blu-Rays, and hopefully the studios will take notice.",1248220800,2,998,4.630681818181818
3578973,4,B001FB55H6,"The Director's cut of Watchmen is finally available for the masses. And while I'm ashamed to say it, I'm worried that this movie will fall into the category of ""Cult Classic."" ""Watchmen,"" although brilliantly directed, has some of the cheesiest and cliched hero dialogue I have ever heard. But aside from all it's faults I absolutely LOVE this movie. And one reason is, drum roll please... Jackie Earle Haley! I think his performance as Rorschach is Oscar worthy. He completely brought the character of Rorschach to life and I would put him up there with Heath Leger's portrayal of DC's infamous Joker. I will admit that I had never even heard of the graphic novel before the movie trailers came out, but as soon as I found out it was based on a graphic novel I ran right to a book store and bought myself a copy. Much like ""Sin City."" I was thrilled to discover that all the hype in the trailers was true. The graphic novel is absolutely amazing, if somewhat convoluted and too descriptive at times. It really was the ""comic that defined comics..."" This film's casting is perfect, except for the casting of Malin Akerman as Laurie. She does a decent job... it's just that I think they could have hired a better actress to play the part. I don't have any suggestions but then again I'm not a casting director. Which I guess negates my whole complaint. But in any case if you like stories about people who have no actual super powers but are classified as ""Super Heroes"" this movie is probably for you. And if not... then screw off! Haha just kidding. But seriously, screw off.",1248220800,3,1576,4.572438162544169
3578974,4,B001FB55H6,"I'll say this right now: I don't like Zack Snyder as a director and I admit I outright laughed when I saw the trailer proclaming him as a ""visionary director"". No, the likes of Spielberg, Kurosawa, Scorsese and Kubrick are visionaries, Snyder is at best serviceable in making likable movies but completely off the mark as much as it succeeds. I am probably one of the few guys that outright hated ""300"" so I wasn't exactly looking forward to ""Watchmen"" and I'll admit on first viewing I didn't like it. But unlike ""300"", somehow Watchmen got better on second viewing and while I still have issues with it, it at least shows Snyder improving as a director; it's just unfortunate he wasn't at his A game when he made this one.

It's 1985 unlike the one we had where President Nixon is enjoying his 5th term as president and the world ticks ever-so-closer to nuclear war, shown visually by the Doomsday Clock, which inches gradually to midnight. Helping out the city were the Watchmen, a group of costumed superheroes who were then outlawed or put under government control by the government after protesting of vigilantism. But when the Comedian, a.k.a Edward Blake, is murdered, attention now comes back to the Watchmen as they try to figure out who murdered the Comedian as well as if they have the capability to halt the impending nuclear war.

A lot of director's cuts are usually extended to either provide an alternate version of the film, a kind of optional ""if you want to"" version where it doesn't really add or subtract from the film but gives you an alternate take on the movie like Terminator 2 or Alien whereas most of the time this is the director's preferred cut; the one they wanted to make that got sidelined thanks to intervening executives. With the ""Watchmen"" and its director's cut, one can actually see that a better movie was hiding underneath than what we got theatrically as scenes are aloud to breathe a lot more, things are fleshed out and the overall pacing, while still a long movie (hair above 3 hours), is at least a little more likable. However, that still leaves things a little awkward in terms of the whole where pieces of the movie work really well like the jailbreak scene and the assassination attempt on Ozymandias and yet things in the middle just kind of feel ""there"" and never really connect or add to the movie's flow.

As far as the casting is concerned, it's a bit inconsistent. Arguably, the best thing Snyder did on the movie was casting Jackie Earle Haley as the seriously messed up Rorschach and now it's hard to picture that character or read the graphic novel without his voice and performance being remembered. In many ways he's the best thing about the movie and I'd even go as far as saying it's similar to the great performance Heath Ledger did as the Joker. (Might even have my new Halloween costume, HA!) As for everyone else, well Jeffrey Dean Morgan makes a good lasting impression with what little screen time he has and Carla Cugino has the first Silk Spectre is good as well and yet I found Billy Crudup's voice as Dr. Manhattan to be, well, more like bored or lazy than detached and unemotional and the should-be awkward and poor shaped Nite Owl is instead played by handsome looking Patrick Wilson so unlike say the X-Men movies where there was barely a miscasting, here it's like one works but somebody else doesn't fit the bill.

One thing that Watchmen does do is look rather stunning in Blu-Ray and many times I was like ""wow, now that's impressive"" and many scenes such as the crashing of glass at the end of the movie, a late-movie explosion and even the detail on Rorschach's mask where you can see the strands and thread is quite outstanding. However when you look at the way the film was shot well, this is Snyder we're talking about and the words ""slow motion"" will frequently come to mind. It's clearly a style-over-substance tactic he's using and he does severely overkill it at times but the clarity on the Blu-ray transfer at least makes it look cool. Also note that this is a particularly violent film and there's quite a few parts that'll make you go ""ooooh...."" in wincing.

For those of you who are wondering, there is a bigger edition coming out in December which will include most likely an even longer cut and other things in the package which is not surprising considering ""300"" just came out with its, what, Blu-ray release? But as a movie I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this; now I have to go watch ""Zodiac"" again and make sure my tastes haven't been diluted with time.",1248220800,3,4567,4.605651105651106
3578975,3,B001FB55H6,"There's a lot that's very entertaining and impressive here. I did not know much about Watchmen before I bought this DVD. But I don't think you have to know a lot about the graphic novel on which this is based to enjoy the film. The film builds upon the fascinating premise that a group of flawed people got together and fashioned themselves into ""superheroes"" who would try to fight crime and protect the innocent. They dressed in wild (intimidating) costumes, developed overpowering strength, and became masters of the martial arts, killing machines. And, for the most part, they were determined to help mankind.

But these superheroes were not perfect, omnipotent beings. Indeed, a couple of them were not much better than the criminals that they fought. Some engaged in criminal behavior themselves. They were humans, and as history teaches us, humans are good at tearing things apart in the name of noble goals.

But it just went on and on. This film made me wonder why movies usually last about 90 to 120 minutes. It must have something to do with attention spans, patience, and focus. So, why not make more movies that run, say, 162 minutes, like this one? By about the two hour mark, I could have cared less about what happened next. No matter how creative, how stimulating, how daring the images on the screen became, I found myself zoning out. Compounding this, I don't think the film finished as powerfully as it started.

My favorite segment was Rorshach's (Jackie Earl Haley) prison break. He and Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson) were my favorite characters. In an imaginary revised version of this overlong production, I would introduce the other characters and the alternate version of 1985 that the film so brilliantly constructed.  But save much of the rest for a sequel or two.",1248134400,,1790,4.839869281045751
3579006,5,B001FB55H6,"This is just to point out something not mentioned in the description. As you know, this comes with an exclusive Nite Owl Ship.

First, it looks cool. Nice details, looks 'properly used'. But here's the thing. After I unpacked it I noticed a slip of paper at the bottom of the box. It described how to replace the batteries in the Nite Owl Ship. Wait... BATTERIES?

So I then discovered the ship is made to easily come off it's stand. Under it there is a battery compartment. It requires a small Phillips head to open. I opened it to confirm... yup a battery compartment with two batteries!

But for the life of me I could not figure out what the Nite Owl Ship was suppose to do! I saw no switch. So I even tried talking to it... nope, no voice recognition.

*** spoiler **

Finally... I figured out the top plate (circular on the very top) is a hidden switch! You press it... and it lights up (detail lights and bright main front lights)! And, for about 5-10 seconds... it makes the SOUNDS of the Nite Owl Ship flying around! The lights stay on until you press the hidden switch again...

This ended up being much more than advertised! :)

3579008,3,B001FB55H6,"There was so much hype about this film that it would be a pity not to watch it. Unfortunately, there was much hype to it.

Not a fan of the comic books, nor of DC Comics particularly, I came to this movie with eyes, ears and mind open. Suspenseful, dark and intriguing were all appropriate adjectives as the film got under way and it certainly required attention to keep track of the plot.

Like a rose which unfolds with exposure to the light and heat, the plot became more fleshed out and the pieces began to knit together with great promise but then at some point it began to lose it's way.

Whether the writers got too carried away with their own complications or whether someone figured that the machinations required some diversion to spice things up I do not know but the film sort of lost it's way and the homily of man as a savage beast faltered.

I tried to picture that the relationship which engulfed the two heroes was to establish their humanity as opposed to the continuous portrayal of the watchmen as the bearers of revenge or retribution or justice but then that really did not work as they were of less important than the omnipotent figure who had retreated from humanity to the empitiness of Mars. Neither did it make sense as a lustful coupling, it just did not seem to form a useful conjunction in the scope of the film as a whole.

As always with the DC mould, there was the explanation, dilema and resolution in the name of good at the end along with the juxtaposition of the savagery and destruction which took place. But by that time there was an element of the unfinished about the film, an aftertaste which was brought on by the films loss of direction shortly after the midpoint.

Entertaining and thought provoking to a certain extent, this film could, and should have, been a lot more than how it was presented on the big screen.",1248134400,,1860,4.471976401179941

A faded gang of superheroes lay dormant until one of their own is murdered, prompting an investigation that leads to a startling discovery about the future of the world and what the cost of peace and the salvation of mankind may be.

As director Zack Snyder's first film with actual characters in it, ""Watchmen"" takes its time in building a back-story for its broad range of colorful characters and misfits, and is all the better for it. The narrative bounces back and forth between the past and the present (which, as it turns out, is a fictional 1985) and yet, through the 162 minutes the film takes to reach its point, it never lets up for one minute or becomes a chore to watch. Truly, this is one film where you won't want to miss a minute, with each scene carrying as much weight and relevancy as the next. While the material at hand is very dark and mature, and even though it won't appeal to a younger or more mainstream audience, it is certainly a film that functions on multiple levels.

The film is chockfull of excellent performances from its cast, but it is Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach who stands out from the pack. This brilliant casting choice creates an iconic character that, many years down the line, the film will be remembered primarily for. As for direction, Snyder flexes his cinematic muscle with enough caffeinated action and jarring visual effects to match wits with the dense plot at hand, in turn, making this his finest film to date. Sure, there is a plethora of directors who could have tried their hand at this material, some perhaps more qualified, but Snyder's film is both classy and stylish and, in a nutshell, as close to perfection as it gets. It's an assault on the senses as well as the psyche, and perhaps one of the darkest superhero tales of our time, translated flawlessly to film.

 ""Watchmen"" might not be enough to pacify one of its creators, but the purists and movie-lovers alike will find it a rare treat in film-making where a film based on a graphic novel or comic book can capture its source material so beautifully while simultaneously stimulating and satisfying those who are not already initiated. ""Watchmen"" is one of those films that, as we look back on this decade in the future, will be talked about and remembered fondly as a definitive film for its era. This is not just one of the finest films of the year, but also one of the best of its kind.",1248134400,4,2534,4.57488986784141
3579010,5,B001FB55H6,"Much has been made of the supposed difficulty of transposing Alan Moore's graphic novels into the medium of film. Previous attempts such as V for Vendetta and From Hell received mixed receptions from critics and audiences, but were both actually very good pieces of cinema. Moore's public disowning of the film imaginings of his work has harmed them, but it says more about his non-conformism than it does about the quality of the movies themselves.

Watchmen is a beautifully crafted and fascinating story (it is one of the New York Times top 100 novels of all time after all). Atmospherically shot, with gravelly narration by the disturbing and uncompromising Rorschach, the imersion into the alternative 1980s history is immediate.

Cold War paranoia has been racheted up and nuclear armageddon seems imminent and terrifying. In 2009 this has less intrinsic power than when Moore penned Watchmen in 1986. The Soviet giant has crumbled and nuclear proliferation has reduced, but the capability of humanity to destroy itself is still a hard truth of the world we live in. That's what makes the character of Dr Manhattan so engrossing. A man turned into a being of god-like power, his struggle to save humanity causes him to lose his own. The portrayl of Manhattan by Billy Crudupp is wonderful; quiet, regretful and absorbing. This is juxtaposed with visual representations of a towering blue giant, destroying human lives with a gesture. The parallel with the awful responsibility of controlling a nuclear button is clear.

The other characters are as well drawn as they need to be to lend support to the blue gargantuan, Rorschach being the most compelling, but Manhattan is the centrepiece. Given near infinite powers, the question settles in the viewers mind, how would I respond to the the needs of my loved ones? My country? The world?

Moore's story is ascerbic and engaging, the lines between good and evil are blurred. The thoughtful, compassionate Nite Owl partners with the uncompromising and brutal Rorschach. Ozymandias mixes intelligence with maeglomania and explains the true nature of sacrifice. Silk Spectre and the Comedian explore themes of human emotions and responses; the interwining of love and grief, exhaltation and regret. As a whole Watchmen is a rich, well textured story which provokes thought as well as entertaining. Watch it.",1248134400,3,2358,5.148825065274152

  There's two ways to look at ""Watchmen."" One is as a movie, without thinking about the source material. Is this regard ""Watchmen"" is great, because it makes you think. Maybe it's a little slow for all the automatons who want nonstop explosions, but then I'm sure you also would've preferred McG or Michael Bay behind the camera instead of Snyder. It's gritty, it's rough. Bad things happen to good people, good things happen to bad people, vice versa for both. Like all the great treasures, it appeals--not to humanity's joy of pretty lights and sounds and fire--but to resonating within us; to a degree, scaring us with what could be. It was similar to my experience with ""V For Vendetta"" (another Moore adaptation he [shockingly] disliked.) When I walked out of the theater, I was grateful I didn't live in V's world. Same for ""Watchmen."" The shots were well done, the violence never really feeling overdone because blood and bones really DO act like that. PEOPLE really do act like that.

  Looking at ""Watchmen"" as an adaptation of the graphic novel, I have to wonder what people are talking about when they say it wasn't accurately represented. Some of the camera shots were EXACTLY as the panels are in the comic! Maybe a thing was tweaked here or there, but otherwise it was one of the most accurate representations I've seen. Now, I know what you Doubters [also known as Mindless Moore Monsters] are saying: the ending. Well, people, I have to say the movie ending made a hell of a lot more sense than the comic's. In terms of terms logistics of the bad guy's plan alone [go ahead, MMM's, look the word up up; I'll wait] it's a better storyline. Snyder cut out only what he needed to cut out, only tweaked what needed to be tweaked. That's why I'm very excited about the Director's Cut, because it PROVES Snyder cut for necessity, not style! Anyone who thinks otherwise needs the Comedian to slap them upside the head.

  Does ""Watchmen"" have flaws? Yes. Manhattan's a little too proud of his firehose and the sex scene(s? can you really count Dan's failure one?) is unnecessary and rather badly acted (the only part though!) Otherwise, it's a spectacular film, both on its own and as an adaptation. Alan Moore wouldn't be happy unless it was done verbatim, scene for scene and line for line, from the source.

3579057,1,B001FB55H6,"This movie was TERRIBLE.

I went to see this movie with a totally open mind really wanting to like it but I came out convinced that this had to be the worst film I ever saw in my life. Overall the plot was long, tedious, and boring. At times it bordered on the ridiculous. Every now and then I questioned why some scenes were even in the movie because they added absolutely nothing to the plot or to progress the story along. Additionally some of the characters' behaviors were just kind of . . . off.  For example,  the other heroes' strange affinity for and loyalty to the Comedian makes no sense to me when you observe the kind of person he was. Every act of cruelty, bullying, assault, and grievous behavior on his part is just shrugged off by the others as if it were nothing. . . it's just the Comedian being the Comedian . . . oh well, he's such a rascal, so what if he might potentially slit my throat while I'm sleeping.

Overall the movie is just another look at the dismal, dark, and self destructive nature of human beings with some questionable heroes thrown in. At best though, the directing, CG work, and editing were interesting, but in general I would say this movie is nothing worth raving about, nothing worth paying for, and nothing worth watching even if it were free.

Perhaps for people who have read and are fans of the comic book, this movie would be enjoyable, but I don't think one should have to read the comic book in order to enjoy the movie.

This film has a ending that will make you think and I guess people just didn't want to watch a movie that made you think. Well, whatever screw them, what do they know? They were probably the ones who wanted a 3 hour action film. Well that's not what this is. There are a few action scenes, but that's it. Just a few.

3579064,1,B001FB55H6,"I wasn't looking forward to seeing Watchmen in the theater.  However, a friend wanted to see it with me, so I figured why not.  Little did I know it would move me enough to come out of retirement and offer my two cents.  So, here goes.

Firstly, if Alan Moore says Watchmen can't and shouldn't be filmed, that's good enough for me.  Alan Moore is a visionary and literary genius.  I am not.  Nor is ANYONE in Hollywood or the people who are willing to see the credibility of Comic Books as an art form sacrificed so they can be entertained for two plus hours.  You know who I'm talking about -Fanboys, the same tools that are simple enough to wonder why Alan Moore hasn't written a sequel to Watchmen and couldn't wait for the sequel to Batman: The Dark Knight Returns.

You know, carriers of the same gray matter that embraced the last three (hell...four) Star Wars movies simply because they have George Lucas' name on them - never mind they were boring, incomprehensible, rife with embarrassing, groan-inducing dialog and largely unwatchable.  Along with Bryan Singer and Kevin Smith, Zack Snyder has now fleshed out the holy trinity of comic book geek-related cinema ""do-no-wrongers.""  No doubt Fanboys have taking to referring to him as ""Zack"", as though he'd bother to learn their names.  They sound like teenage girls talking about Zack Efron.

Basically it's all Trekkie mentality (and no, not ""TrekkER""...you weirdos aren't butching up your nickname on my watch) -a school of thought which dictates as long as there's product to be had, it's good, especially if it is self-referential and self-reverential.

Anyway, I figured out a while ago (around the release of Tim Burton's Batman), that although I am a fan of the source-material and it's kinda cool to see living people play out a comic book story, that doesn't mean it should happen, nor does it make it automatically good.  Even if they get some of it right, like Richard Donner did with Superman's origin, comic book movies are common these days and some just flat suck.  Bryan Singer's Superman, the first attempt at a Hulk movie, Ghost Rider, Catwoman, The Spirit (Frank Miller can obviously do wrong) and now Watchmen come to mind, not to mention every Batman film with which Tim Burton was even remotely involved.

But, I digress...

Watchmen, as directed by Zack Snyder is no less than an empty-headed Fanboy fetish film for con-season circle-jerks.  It is an exercise in just how bad things can go wrong when a trendy action director with zero facility with actors is granted access to a historic character piece.  Snyder was a director out of his milieu.  Did you see Benjamin Button?  Same thing.  Call me pretentious if you want, for I care not (Mark sniffed).  Zack Snyder had no business directing Watchmen.  It was boring, ill-paced and devoid of impact.  It had little emotional resonance, zero suspense and even less thrills.

Watchmen was needlessly violent, confusing (and I've read it three times so it shouldn't be), amateurish in its storytelling sensibilities, unoriginal in technique and execution and an insult to what Alan Moore was trying to accomplish with Watchman as a story meant to only be told in comic book form.

The choices in popular music were silly, unoriginal and made little cinematic sense. Snyder did not gracefully pace to them or cleverly cut to them.  He just played them, as though the atmospherics of contrast between scenes of destruction and Nat King Cole would ""just work"" in an ironic fashion.  And how completely of unoriginal of him to try.  John Woo he most certainly is not.

Well, it doesn't ""just work"".  Flight of the Valkyries?  Was Snyder serious with that?  Look.  that song is PERMANENTLY associated with Apocalypse Now as a storytelling element.  Was it supposed to be funny?  Because the audience was laughing.  Does he even know how to be original?  How hamfisted can a director be before I laugh when I'm supposed to feel chills, laugh at his ineptitude?

The plot revelations had no weight.  As a viewer, I did not feel any sense of world crisis in the atmosphere, no one's death made me feel much and even on the one occasion a scene was played and cut for laughs, it wasn't remotely funny.  I guess the fact that I neither fell asleep nor walked out should be considered a compliment.

Snyder did get the Minutemen right, from a visual sense anyway.  It was cool seeing cloth costumes for a switch and the retro-look of the individual Minuteman origin/backstory snippets rocked.  However, mere snatches of visual accuracy do not necessarily a wholly good interpretation, or even a good movie make.  Watchmen is loaded with visual accuracy, unfortunately it doesn't add up to much.  It's supposed to be a period film, circa 1985, but nothing suggested it really -certainly not the music, the obviously-made-with-21st-century-technology costumes or set design.  Sure, he had 99 Luft Balloons playing but like most of the music choices it was a distraction not a complement to the goings-on.

As far as characterizations go, Doctor Manhattan is completely wrong.  Does he sound ominous, detached or creepy?  Nope, Snyder decided Dr. Manhattan, a man one with the universe, has Billy Cruddup's voice ...and it's not just a bad choice, it's a clueless one.  The weightiest character in the book, the one fraught with irony and philosophical contradiction and sporting the least humanity, a man decimated and reassembled with the power of a star sounds like Billy Cruddup?

Um, no.  He should sound soulless, without even a grasp of the concepts of humanity, compassion or remorse.  His voice should sound hollow, devoid (I know what you're thinking and, no, I don't mean George W. Bush).  He should sound like 2001: A Space Odyssey's HAL or Brian Cox's Hannibal Lecter in Manhunter.

How could Snyder miss such a no-brainer?  Is he high?

It is a choice reminiscent of the Paul Dini Superman cartoon with Tim Daly voicing both Superman and Clark Kent - his voice fits neither character and its register does not change with his identity.

Then there is Silk Spectre, far more powerful, confident in her sexuality from the get-go and, well, a murderer of street trash (via a gleeful knife to the neck).  Three things she never was in the comic.  Her character registers little baggage and is little more than a sex toy in this movie.

When confronted by a gang of street toughs, she and the Night Owl evidently enjoy the violence they are forced to participate in, which, again, is nothing like the way they acted in the published work, hesitant, shaken and a tad remorseful.

Ozymandias is clearly the mustache-twirling villain from scene one instead of hiding behind his image as fey narcissist, rendering the revelation of his involvement, well, uninvolving and not a shocker in the least, a non-stunner.

The Comedian they got right, but as a character he is more a force of nature than macguffin in the movie.  The whodunit aspect of Watchmen barely exists other than when Rorschach's voice-over tells you it does.  It's not an element sensed in the air and there's zero suspense -and not just because I knw how it ends going in, as the ending was changed (some thing Fanboys have no problem with because, dammit, it just looked so much like the comic.  There is no ""Oh, my God"" feeling when Ozymandias comes clean.  Unto his own, The Comedian and his backstory are interesting, but as part of the main plot line, he's just kind of there when needed.  He is the most well-developed of any of the characters in Watchmen, but that is not saying a whole lot.

Rorschach they sorta got right except he seemed possessed of super-powers of agility and durability he does not have.  There were blows delivered to him by Ozmandias that should have either killed him or paralyzed him.  Again, what looks cool and what plays are two different things.  Rorschach looked cool being tossed about but it was over-the-top violence no man could recover from.

Also, why is Rorschach now portrayed a sadistic dealer of punishment, reveling in violence instead of one who simply uses it as a tool, with neither a second thought or joy?  He displayed too much satisfaction doling it out.  Rorschach's heart rate should NEVER rise.  This Rorschach's obviously did.  Now he'll joyfully and repeatedly whack you about the skull with a butcher knife instead of casually strolling away as you burn, chained to a cast-iron stove, having forgotten you already.  A pure sociopath, Rorschach doesn't wallow in others' pain, he's indifferent to it.  It gets the job done.  It is a tool, an end to a means.

Directors always point out that things change in the translation to screen.  I defy Zack Snyder to state why Rorschach now cleaves skulls with glee.  Like the ending, It is a scene changed for absolutely no structural reason.  It was gratuitous violence for the sake of gratuitous violence.  It was a needless decision and anathema to the character of Rorschach.

It was never clear whether the actors playing Nixon, Pat Buchanan and Ted Koppel were intentional or unintentional awfully done impersonations or intentional or unintentional awfully done caricatures. Either way they were insipid and ill-conceived. Both the makeup artist and person responsible for casting them should have been fired.  Better yet, the characters should have only appeared in silhouette or bathed in shadow in the first place.  This Nixon could not even move his upper lip and none of the actors sounded or looked like those they were meant to represent in the least. They looked about as convincing as Jon Voight was when he played Howard Kossell in The Greatest ...in other words, not at all convincing and rubbery.  What's more, the entire scene was a visual ripoff of Dr. Strangelove, just as Ridley Scott's camera angles and permeated the film.

Sure, as I've noted a zillion time that Picasso once said ""good artists borrow, great artists steal.  However, there's a difference between an homage and a lack of original storytelling vision.  Snyder fills images interestingly enough, it's the storytelling, pacing and characterization skills that are missing from his movies.  In other words, he hasn't earned the right to steal because he's yet to do anything original.

So they managed a few interesting translations of elements of character and more visuals evocative of the source material than one could hope for and yet it still did not seem to work as anything other than something easily-pleased Fanboys will enjoy.

Here's why.  Here's the venom Alan Moore spoke of.

As published, Watchmen was a work designed to both implement and showcase the finer intricacies of comic book storytelling using techniques unique to the medium and if Alan Moore says it can't be filmed, it can't be friggin' filmed. Period.

As I stated above, the man is a literary storytelling genius and there's what...maybe a dozen of those guys alive at any given time in literary history?  Alan Moore CHOSE not to become a genius film director because doubtless, as a storytelling genius, film would likely be childs' play for him.  That and he, himself has stated he finds comics a richer medium to work in.

So, no Ridley Scott wannabe (no less than 3 of Scott's TV commercials from the 80's have cameos and it would not surprise me if Snyder once worked at Scott Free Productions under Ridley and Tony Scott) is going to pull it off no matter how much frame-pulling, freeze-framing, washed-out color, jump-edited 90's GAP-ad pyrotechnics he deploys. Anyone who witnessed the derivation-fest of post-Heston, toga and sandals homoerotica that was 300 could see it coming.  He's all flash that will one day be passe'.  In cinema, it's the story that must hold up over time, otherwise a films' original visual merits will wash away with time.

Snyder is not a visionary in the least or original enough to steal from truly great artists of cinema.  He is a ripoff artist.  With its scenes of wheat-field family reunions, pseudo-wannabe Shakespearean political machinations and glycerin-soaked abs, 300 was the single most derivative movie in recent memory, nothing more than Gladiator-in-panties filtered through the eyes of a far lesser ""talent"".

See, Zach Snyder isn't an actor's director or even one I consider a filmmaker.  Like McG, he is an MTV level video director of digitally-processed images, chiefly concerned with imagery, and in Watchmen's case, largely unoriginal imagery.  He thinks replicating the comic is enough to successfully adapt the movie and it's not.  There is more to it than that.

Watchmen is a character piece/whodunnit and a costume drama with snatches of action and Snyder and his writers (David Hayter, actually credited among the many writers of the X-Men films and first-timer Alex Tse don't seem to understand that just because you copy what's on the comic book page doesn't mean it's going play onscreen.

Comics and film are two distinctly different mediums with sensibilities that must accommodate one another when translating one medium to the other.  The Hollywood translation of The Great Gatsby is probably the most glaring example of this rule of screenwriting 101, as it too is an awful film which drew dialog and imagery directly from the page.

I cannot imagine what people who have never read the comic must think whilst viewing Watchmen.  (I do know of a couple of people completely unfamiliar with Watchmen who saw it.  They were bored senseless and walked out.)  Primary characters disappear for nearly an hour, many of the briefer flashback scenes are clumsily paced and placed and not a single character is a pop culture icon.  It's like a series of inside jokes poorly executed.

So much that should have been cool, that was intended to be cool, just wasn't...and this movie, like it's author has made perfectly clear, should never have been attempted.

But no. Fanboys, in their endless devotion to people they don't know, will embrace it simply because Snyder ""did good"" translating 300.  That's how fanboys roll.  Think about it.  They actually believe Kevin Smith has contributed something memorable to the comic book storytelling medium simply because he used to be one of them.  If they think Smith and his chatty Batman, over-written Daredevil, no-show Bullseye, needlessly and sadistically trauma'd Black Cat and clich Green Arrow are actually relevant, no doubt Fanboys see Zack Snyder as the second coming of David Fincher (Ain't it Cool News' primary over-worshipped ""visionary"").

Just as Charleton Heston labored cluelessly through (and later -after the director and writer enlightened him -lived homophobically in denial of) some of the gayest scenes in cinema history, just as dimbulb fans live in denial of the outright crappiness of post-Kirshner Star Wars movies, the laughable second and third chapters of the Matrix franchise and character-bastardization of Bryan Singer's Superman and Lex Luthor, these fanboy tools will embrace the mess of half-witted filmmaking that is Watchmen, further empowering Snyder and licensing him to more shots at ruining other, relevant comic book works.

There was a time when I would have been afraid he might get hold of Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, but Frank Miller himself already rendered moot any claims to art DK once had by scrawling his own Godawful sequel for a lousy buck.

Bottom Line: It is not that Watchmen was only a bad interpretation of Watchmen, it's that it was just very bad filmmaking by a very predictable, unoriginal and trendy MTV director, one whose style has all the subtlety of a linebacker.

So, Watchmen just wasn't what I consider to be a good movie.  Sure I may have gotten a tad harsh on Snyder or Fanboys above, but there have been plenty of movies I thought I'd never like that surprised me because they turned out to be well-made movies with well-told stories.

That being said, I hope Zack Snyder stays away from Marvel Studios.  I don't want Zack Snyder anywhere near any property that matters, or matters to me, ever again.",1247356800,27,16050,4.925912137006701
3579105,1,B001FB55H6,"The one star review is meant to be misleading.  Just as the marketing of the 'comic' was.  The original graphic novel was a thought-provoking story which would have been better accepted as Japanese animation than in its comic-book guise.  Similarly, this film would have been better accepted if done in an art-film limited release manner.  Just looking at all the reviews on Amazon confirm it- the film polarizes people to the point where they simply must comment and discuss and think.  This is art and science fiction the way it's meant to be- forcing us to look again at society and ourselves.

The two biggest concerns I heard from people were Dr. Manhattan's pigsticker hangin' out and the graphic violence.  Neither, according to some, were necessary.  Simple question- if they were not necessary and incidental, then why are they generating such extensive discussion?  It's intriguing that the horrific violence in Saving Private Ryan was better accepted, mostly because such images are an accepted part of war.  Graphic violence is not typically viewed as a typical part of superhero stories, but it is, in fact, a part of comic book violence and anime.  Same thing with the sexuality of Dr. Manhattan and the scene with Silk and Night.

Viewed as an artful portrayal of a graphic novel, this film is brilliant.  There will be no sequel.  It will stand on its own.  And I bet in 10 years it'll still be selling on Amazon.",1247356800,38,1429,4.823045267489712

The ending has been changed somewhat, but I thought this had been done in a way that was actually a bit better than the graphic novel in parts (the disaster at the end of the graphic novel does come off as a bit absurd), although Dr Manhattan's decision at the end is ultimately not satisfying (and a bit similar to the Batman's decision at the end of The Dark Knight, come to think of it...).

Visually, it's a better-than dead-on match, from costume design to story telling, and from lighting to action scenes. Plot wise, I felt the theatrical release, which I just watched on DVD was good, but just too slow in the beginning. In this ever-impatient world we live in, it makes sense that a big piece of the audience would complain. But, if you're a fan of sophisticated tales, take an interest in plot development and appreciate non-linear story telling, you are going to enjoy this movie. Personally, I wasn't impressed with some of the music choices, but I especially loved all of the orchestra tracks.

My last comment is on the non-linear storytelling approach. The graphic novel does it well, seemingly unforgiving to the reader in its transitions and open-ended plot lines--making you wait for more, then nearly forcing you to forget what you were waiting for before bringing you back--but yet the movie would have faired better off from less of that stylization.

3579111,5,B001FB55H6,"When I first saw the trailer for Watchmen, I was whiped into a tizzy and immediatly had to rush out and get the graphic novel, instantly hooking myself into the world of the Watchmen and become a hardcore fan. When it finally came out that March day, I saw it twice and each time was completley blown away. Becoming one of those rare movies to be faithfully adapted and still retail some of its hardcore punch, Watchmen is in my opinion one of the best films of the year, perhaps even one of the best comic book movies ever made.

Set in an alternate universe from our own, superhereos are pretty common place until a law is passed banning them from doing any more super work. When one of these supers, The Comedian, is murdered, it sets into motion a series of events that will have the world hanging on the crises and forcing these retired heroes back into action.

Once again, Zack Snyder employs a similiar method he used for 300, with the whole greenscreen effect and once again it works beautifully. Each scene just jumps right at you, you are submersed into this grainy underworld that occasionally pops with brillinatly flashes of color (most obviously the yellow) and the effects are pretty damn amazing. Visually, it achieves on all fronts.

And I have to point out the choice of music was absolutly spot on. I cannot listen to Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are a-Changin"" without imagining the opening credits, which by the one are one of the many highlights of the film.

What seperates Watchmen from other superhero/comic movies is the amazing psychological depths of the characters, profiles that you rarely ever see in these type of films (the other obvious example being the Batman series). With the likes of the Comedian, a typically vile character who you want to feel no sympathy for or Nite Owl, who is very spineless and docile, these characters could have easily been one dimensional and stagnat, but there were so many other layers to them, not just these outside conceptions but deeper, more thoughtful ideas that show more to each of the characters. And this kind of thing is certaintly not lost in the transition from book to screen, with each one holding just as much of their psychological profile and character traits that give the movie so much more then just an action/comic forray.

With that in mind, every actor is great in the film, with defintinly the one standing out being Jackie Earl Haley as the violent Rorscache. Already my favorite from the comic, Haley goes above and beyond bringing him to life, adding so much more to the character then was seen in the comic, which is really saying something. He to me has become the new Joker of the year.

I was a bit shocked at the sort of lukewarm reception the film got, but then again it wasn't like I didn't expect it. Watchmen the comic is going to be universally great because of its impact but the film is definintly going to split people, its just another one of those love it or hate it films, with me falling on the love it side. But truly, this is one of the must see films this year and once you view it, then you can make up your mind on it.

To much slow-mo, to much violence and gore (much more than in de Comic) and very little acting. It is like watching the comic move, but it feels flat. I get the impression that the actors are quite bored with their characters (the same impression I had with SW Episode I)
The relation of Sally and Laurie is not there, you also don't get the hate between Laurie and the comedian... or the right wing orientarion of Rorscharch, or the feeble figure of night-owl.

3579175,5,B001FB55H6,"The director's cut runs about 25 minutes longer, and incorporates more elements from the comics, adds more violence, as well as more shots of Dr. Manhatten's schlong.  Some of the previous scenes are reworked with additional dialogue.  Information has been supported by sites such as AICN etc.

Overall, the storyline and conversations are better fleshed out, and this version is truer to the comics.  The largest additional addition is that of Hollis Mason's death, which is spectacularly directed to the score of the Intermezzo from the opera Cavalleria Rusticana (think Godfather III).

(1) Rorschach gets additional dialogue, some straight from the comics.

(2) When Rorschach searches the Comedian's apartment shortly after the opening scene, he encounters two cops still stationed there.  He fights briefly with them before jumping back out the window.

(3) Conversation between Dan and Rorschach (beans scene) is extended.

(4) All flashbacks extended, with the exception of Sally's.

(5) Dr. Manhatten discussing the symbol on his forehead.  Additional questions in the face to face with Dr. Manhatten.  Dan and Hollis watch Dr. Manhatten go crazy on their TV set.

(6) Laurie getting interrogated by the military as they try to determine Dr. M's whereabouts (on Mars).  Alessandro Juliani's (Lt. Gaeta from Battlestar Galactica) scene has been reinserted.  He plays one of the scientists who bursts in during the interrogation of Laurie to tell the military that they've located Dr. M on Mars.

(7) Probably the biggest addition is the depiction of Hollis Mason's death at the hands of the knot heads.  Interestingly, the death is done from poor Hollis' POV, where he imagines himself fighting the gangsters of the 1940s.  He delivers left and right hooks to Captain Evil, before being done in by ""Moloch"".  The score for the death scene is very fitting.

(8) Dan taking revenge on an isolated knot head at a bar, post Hollis' death.  It's a brutal revenge.

(9) The shootout by hired hitman Roy Chess is much more brutal- e.g. more blood and gore, fingers blown off.

(10) Conversation between Dr. Long and Rorschach is extended.

(11) Longer jail-break scene with arguments between Rorschach and Laurie.  Prison guards open fire on Dan's ship.

(12) Longer conversation between Dr. M and L on Mars.

(13) Riot scene is longer with more conversation between the Comedian and the rioters.

(14) Agent Forbes (Fulvio Cecere) has a larger role as the government agent in charge of handling all the Watchmen.

3579176,5,B001FB55H6,"I read the graphic novel about 8 years ago and the film is very true to the book. The story answers the philosophical question Who Guards the Guardians? or, in this case, Who Watches the Watchmen?

The movie takes place in 1985 in which all, but 2, superheroes cannot legally exist. Those that continue their crime fighting do so outside the law, Richard Nixon is still President of the United States and tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States are at an all time high.

Some former members of the group Watchmen are targeted for assassination by an unknown killer and the group's members also become ensnared in a conspiracy with worldwide implications.

The point of ""Watchmen"" is not one of ideology.

Rather, the conflict exists between the powerful and the non-powerful.

The charachters motivated by power and altrusitic virtue try to force the world to go their way, regardless of the cost.

The central point of the novel and movie is: who is making sure that our leaders/heroes don't run amok?

I think the book's author, Alan Moore, tried to show that the validity of that question doesn't change with political leanings or ideology.

Simultaneously, through 'Watchmen', Moore also demonstrates his rejection of the bankrupt utilitarian notion of 'the ends justify the means' and showing how dieties (in the form of Doctor Manhattan) would not be able to resist the urge of domination.

The end justifying the means is almost always the rationalization of people in positions of power who will, by hook or by crook, work to ""make a better world"" even at the expense of other people's lives in order to achieve some sort of ""common"" goal for ""the greater good"".

A movie like this could not have come out at a better time since almost all people subscribe to the bankrupt idea that sometimes it is appropriate to violate the rights of other people.

After doing so, one need only look in the mirror to see who would be next in terms of having the ability to exist erased because ""the greater good"" or society demands it.

Also pay particular attention to the character Rorschach, who is based on Steve Ditko's character 'The Question'. He is the only voice in the trailer, with the phrase ""The world will look up at us and shout: Save Us! and I'll whisper 'No!'""

The message of the movie is timeless and, like the film itself, the acting, sets and special effects are all excellent.",1246406400,4,2408,4.7458033573141485
3579177,3,B001FB55H6,"Let me start by saying that just because I had previously read and enjoyed the graphic novel doesn't mean that I'm against the movie because you have to realize that things must be changed in order to move from one medium to another.

The Goods:
Jackie Earle Haley- Haley is the standout of this movie, capturing the spirit and characterization of Rorschach and wonderfully presenting his own interpretation.  Fans of the character will be happy with the onscreen Rorschach, Haley bring some new to the already familiar.  Depending on the rest of the movies coming out this year and following the win of Heath Ledger, an Academy Award nomination for Haley's performance may not be out of the question.

The Opening Credits- Set in an alternate future/present, director Zack Snyder needed to inform the audience of just what kind of alternate reality to expect.  Cue the opening credits, a beautiful montage of scenes covering information that movie wouldn't cover from the graphic novel.  By far this was my favorite part of the movie.

Jeffrey Dean Morgan- In a small, but pivotal role, Morgan takes on The Comedian.  Seeing the world as a cruel, sick joke, The Comedian takes it upon himself to deliver the punchlines that nobody asked for.  Morgan takes this role and makes it into a character you either love hating or hate to love.

The Okays:
The Ending- Without spoiling anything, the ending works, but could have been better.  The graphic novel ending worked because of the events leading up to it and with exclusion of such information, the ending had to be changed.  The new ending made sense with the direction of the movie, but one could argue that it was a cop-out and another choice could have been made.

Billy Crudup- As Jon Osterman, more commonly known by his hero name Doctor Manhattan, is the only character with powers.  Presented as a character that lacks human emotion, Crudup does well.  Unfortunately nothing new is brought to the character, leaving a see through personality that gets little to no depth despite having his own back story.

The Bads:
Malin Akerman- Stealing the show in a negative way, Akerman is in the movie for no other reason than to have people look at.  After a string of movies that gloss over her role, she now takes on a central character, doing a horrible job.  In terms of the acting, I can safely say she is the worst part.

The Soundtrack- The soundtrack itself is great if listened to on its own, but when played over the movie it becomes atrocious.  One could make the argument that the songs fit perfectly within the movie, but it seems like the songs fit the movie too well, turning good songs and good scenes into cringe worthy segments of cheesiness.

The Direction- When I first heard that Zack Snyder was taking on the directing duties I knew one thing for sure, Snyder would do his best to make the movie as close to the source material as he possibly could.  While most times this is what the fans want, it more or less backfired for Watchmen.  Snyder took the script and then added in as much of the small background information as he could, whether or not there were any in text acknowledgement of the subjects at hand.  The primary example is the existence of Bubastis, the pet of one of the characters.  Because of the change in the ending and the antagonist's motivations, the creature has no relevance or explanation of why it's in the movie to begin with.

All in all the subject says it all: I feel that there's more bad than there is good, but it's probably the best adaptation one could hope for.  Many people will love it for a fun go-to movie for a good time, others will hated it because of the little things.  Overall it isn't a bad movie, but not something every fan of the graphic novel would love either.

3579178,4,B001FB55H6,"The graphic novel WATCHMEN is perhaps the greatest graphic novel ever written.  I'm not one to linger on that title too much, since I've never been a big comic book guy; I will say that WATCHMEN is certainly a great work of literature.  It features some insightful and disturbing suggestions, set against a fantastic premise: what if individuals, inspired by comic books, began dressing up in costumes and fighting crime?  And what would happen when these masked heroes came across a genuine superhero?

Zack Snyder's film is an almost-too-faithful adaptation of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon's source novel.  WATCHMEN doesn't feel like its own film; it feels more like a tribute to the graphic novel.  Nor, for that matter, does the movie quite congeal: it's more a hodgepodge of related scenes thrown together.  Granted, everything is visually stunning, and the action keeps the film flowing fairly smoothly.  However, the theoretical concepts aren't quite meant for the silver screen.  Hollywood has rarely been able to achieve the complexity of the written (or illustrated) word, and the relative flatness of WATCHMEN's (the film) ending is bitter proof of that.  When I saw it in the cinema, people actually laughed.

You will have to decide for yourself if Snyder deserves praise or condemnation for keeping the film so faithful.  Overall, WATCHMEN is an enjoyable film experience that is worth repeating.  The acting is fairly solid, especially from Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan, and Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach, the film's driving character.  Dialogue and scenes are mostly taken word-for-word from the graphic novel (whether they should be or not is debatable).  The end result is a film worth seeing, but when compared to the source material pales almost into non-existence.  Nor can you really judge the film on its own merits, since it goes so far out of its way to stay true to the novel.",1246233600,2,1903,5.031948881789138
3579179,3,B001FB55H6,"Overall, I *would* have given it an 4 (the scene on Mars went beautifully) - except the retarded new ending dragged it down to maybe a 5. Worth seeing. Adequate to the task. Great visuals.

Of course many people will like the new ending. It's been dumbed down for the masses. As soon as I heard the ending was changed last year, I predicted it - so it elicited a big yawn from me at the theater (and I don't blame Alan Moore AT ALL for divorcing himself from this project - the re-write is an insult). I can't explain how self-defeating it is without giving too much away for those that haven't seen the movie (but have read the book).

I thought there was plenty of action (and sex), but another problem is that everyone seems to be a jacked up super-hero who can punch through or get slammed through concrete walls, etc - when the only one with actual super-powers is supposed to be Manhattan. Another basic level corruption of the source material.

They changed Rorschach *slightly* by lessening his hrrrrm vocal tick and streamlining him into kind of a Batman-ish bada@@. He still says it a few times under his breath, as if to substitute it for hmmm. Like ""hmmm. that's interesting"" or as a non-verbal response to something seen - not a recurring pattern in his speech that adds to the ""unpleasantness"" of being around Rorschach. But other than that, Jackie Earle Haley did a fantastic job! There are several scenes that seem to have animated themselves straight from the comic page as that is Snyder's strength as a director, not his writing. If the new ending is any indication of his ability as a storyteller, his skills are pedestrian at best.

Overall I did enjoy the film and I am one of those people that was there in September '86 reading Watchmen #1 off the rack. But I can't let that pathetic ending slide, and it brings the quality of the entire film down.",1246233600,2,1872,4.513274336283186
3579180,1,B001FB55H6,"Ignore the blathering Fanboys, most of whom also thought that the Transformer movies were the height of Intellectual  Cinema.  This movie absolutely was NOT ""faithful"" to the Graphic Novel.  It was instead a parody of the graphic novel, and a prime example of why Alan Moore said that a Watchmen movie should never be made.

First of all, Zack Snyder should never be allowed to film anything other than movie trailers.  I'll grant that he really, REALLY knows how to put together a hell of a trailer.  It's everything else that he sucks at.  Here's a good example: in the original graphic novel, Doc Manhattan's penis shows up in two panels.  TWO PANELS out of all the individual comics that eventually comprised the Watchmen graphic novel.  But Snyder literally wags it in our faces throughout the entire movie.  What was originally a commentary on Manhattan's growing disconnect from Humanity became nothing but more of Snyder's homoerotic pandering to complete nitwits.

Beyond that, consider the ""alley fight"" between the muggers and NiteOwl/Silk Spectre.  Snyder, never content to just portray a scene the way it occurs in the source material, had to toss in a bunch of gratuitous compound-fractures to appeal to what he sees as his core audience: juvenile imbeciles with room-temperature I.Q.s.  It's no wonder Moore hates adaptations of his work- guys like Snyder not only miss the point, they gleefully misinterpret what Moore was trying to say until the end result pisses all over Moore's actual message.

I don't miss the Squid, though.  If there was one thing Snyder changed for the better, it was the Squid-less ending.",1246147200,10,1631,5.011152416356877
3579181,5,B001FB55H6,"Destined to become a classic, Watchmen is like no superhero movie you've ever seen. It reveals in an incredibly believeable way, how anyone who would choose to run around in a costume beating people up must be some sort of zealot/fetishist/psychopath. remember that nobody save for Dr. Manhattan has any superpowers, and you'll understand what I mean.

It also shows how the existence of people like this would have altered the course of history in obvious and subtle ways. Nixon campaigning for a fourth term? Awesome. And now we know who was behind JFK's assassination (and who carried it out!) Don't miss the cameo by ""Lee Iacocca""! LOL

As for the fanboy whining (and to be honest, I haven't seen very much of that, but I'll address it anyway because it's fun) I've been a huge fan of Watchmen since it was originally published in the mid-80's and I have to say EVERY change they made for this film was an improvement! Trust me, I'm shocked that I'm saying that, but it's true.

Rorscach's ""origin"" retains the coolness of him ""becoming"" Rorschach years after he misguidedly thought he already was, but is FAR more powerful as portrayed in the film. It makes more sense than the scene in the comic and brilliantly does away with the Mad Max ripoff with the handcuffs and the hacksaw.

 The new ending is more poignant, makes far, far more sense, and even ties together strands from the original comic's plot (especially those involving Ozy and Dr. Manhattan) in ways so much more clever than the original, that Moore should be kicking himself for not having come up with it himself.

This is the same formula that killed any chance of a Lost In Space movie franchise, the whole ""Screw the old Trekkies, I'll show them how it's done"" attitude.  Epic fail.

Zach Snider, in his infinite wisdom, made a Watchmen movie for the fans that kept it alive for twenty-five years.  That's why I'll be purchasing this in July and watching it many times while the new Star Trek will never grace my media shelves.  Ever.

Perfect?  No.  Recommended to persons not familiar with the book?  No, but only because it is excessively long.

I can even live with the slightly alternate ending which some of the genius reviewers here are doing a damned fine job of spoiling.

Bizarre is the key word to me in your comment. You use it as if it's a bad thing. Of course Watchmen is bizarre, and I don't think you understand how well you're fitting yourself into the unprepared audiences that Salmon listed in his above comment. Watchmen is bizarre, original, thought-provoking, and monumental. And I'll list some supporting facts unlike you.

1. To date, no superhero movies have touched on the adult themes that would most likely plague the people-behind-the-masks' lives. It created accurate and complex psychological profiles for each character, giving us an in-depth insight. The art and color styling stayed true to the book, and made for a very original and artful look (not to mention that it took several several panels straight from the comic and used them as storyboard.) The entire feel, sound, and content of the movie was quite original.

2. The subject matter was very thought-provoking. It touches heavily on adult roles, the driving force behind the universe, moral ambiguity, and much more. In the end, you decide where you stand with Adrien's plot. There's no implied right or wrong.

3. Just like the book, the movie brought to light all that Watchmen did for comic books back in the day for movies NOW. I cannot recommend the book highly enough, and although the theatrical cut serves as a somewhat incomplete and amended summary, it is the most loyal-to-source-material movie I have ever seen.

Watchmen is a triumph. ""People must be told."" The world will discover eventually... hopefully.

But it should be given some merit for the single fact that Time magazine named it one of the 100 best novels (not graphic or comics, just novels) of all time. Most were worried that such an intense story was unfilmable. A lot of directors and studio execs had tried to bring it to the screen but their efforts fell short before production even began. Then came director Zach Snyder (fresh off just adapting Frank Miller's graphic novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300-The-Complete-Experience-Blu-ray-Book-Digital-Copy-and-BD-Live-Blu-ray/dp/B001LF2WCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300: The Complete Experience (Blu-ray Book + Digital Copy and BD-Live) [Blu-ray</a>]), and all fell into place. Now, the movie is out and I can't rave enough about it!

A quick synopsis of the story, by legendary writer Alan Moore and artist
Dave Gibbons, is that, in an alternate 1985 where Richard M. Nixon is
still President of the U.S. and when masked heroes have been outlawed,
a long-time costumed hero/government agent, Edward Blake, is murdered
and another costumed hero/vigilante, Rorschach, suspects that there is
a serial killer picking off costumed heroes. Through the overall plot,
each main character's backstory is explored (think TV's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-The-Complete-Seasons-1-5/dp/B0021L8FO4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost: The Complete Seasons 1-5</a>, which co-creators Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse admit to Watchmen being a major influence) as five major ex-costumed heroes try to bring the killer to justice. The story isn't just full of action, violence, nudity and cussing -- it's got plenty of that. But it's also about the deep psychology and philosophy rooted in superhero mythology; i.e., separation from one's own humanity and dealing with all the drama and mess that comes with life; living an impotent life when not doing what you feel destined to do; being an uncompromising force in a world that needs compromise; giving in to a lie that you believe will help billions of others; and not facing up to a past of lies that you swore your life by. Each character confronts their own inner demons (most of which made them get into the costumed hero business in the first place), while trying to solve the overall mystery of the killer's motive.

I'm a fan of the graphic novel (albeit not one of those diehard fans) and thoroughly enjoyed the film adaptation. I wouldn't compare it to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight-Two-Disc-Special-Edition-Digital-Copy/dp/B001GZ6QDS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy)</a>&nbsp;per se because the two movies are different in the sense that ""Knight"" portrays a character that has many stories to choose from, while Watchmen is a compacted story with a beginning and an ending. Whereas Batman is allowed to have a sequel because there are several stories to tell, Watchmen has one single story and it's told in all its brilliance. And the movie perfectly captures it all. BTW, just the thought of a sequel to ""Watchmen"" makes me shudder in disgust.

I had heard that some content would be cut from the film, but what was cut was small and didn't make a major difference to the quality of the film. And the ending that Snyder and co. did change made the film better IMHO. One of my favorite aspects ofthe film is that it shows in many ways how screwed up in the head that masked heroes would have to be to do what they do. One of the best scenes is a small scene where Dan/Nite Owl II and Laurie/Silk Spectre II are talking at dinner about an old foe of theirs who dressed up and did crime just so he could be beaten for sexual gratification. When asking what happened to the foe, Dan tells Laurie that he tried it with tough guy Rorschach and the vigilante dropped him down an elevator shaft. After hearing the news, Laurie abrupts in hysterical laughter to which Dan shortly follows suit (in the book, they laugh a lot harder); and I think that the fact that they find it funny proves how twisted they are. A well-played and well-written scene among many.

I won't lie that there is extreme violence in the film and it's not for
the faint of heart, but the overall story is magnificent, nonetheless.
The use of music was brilliant and the fact that Snyder used classic
songs (Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are-A Changing,"" Nat King Cole's
""Unforgettable,"" Simon and Garfunkel's ""Sounds of Silence,"" Leonard
Cohen's ""Hallelujah,"" just to name a few) was compellingly appropriate
seeing how they accompany a comic adaptation that many consider the
classic of all comic stories. Not since the use of Jimi Hendrix's ""Hey
Joe"" in ""Forrest Gump"" have songs been so perfectly matched to a scene!

I commend Snyder and company for their adaptation to a graphic novel that
everyone said was unfilmable. I thought the movie was superb! I just
can't say enough good things about it. I could go on more about this
film but then I'd have to get into talking about specific scenes that
might spoil the movie and its plot, so I'll digress. If you're a fan of
ANY superhero/costumed hero comic book movie or comic books in general,
just see the movie. Of course, it's always better to read the book. And
most diehard fans are going to notice the differences but I know that
what works in a book (as well as its length) might not always work in a
movie. If Snyder didn't put enough in, people would complain about
that. But if he puts too much in, people (critics) complain about that.
I thought he put in the perfect amount, which was nearly everything.
This will definitely be one of the best, most epic comic book movies

3579242,3,B001FB55H6,"First off: I am a big fan of Alan Moore's WATCHMEN comic. It's the War And Peace of the graphic medium; broad in scope, meticulously executed, and brimming with interesting ideas. Moore and artist Dave Gibbons' concept, to place superheroes into the `real' world, proved a brilliant one.  The characters, both shaped by and shaping the universe they inhabit, turn out to be mostly un-heroic misfits and borderline lunatics. Yet Moore's ability to identify with even the most extreme of these strange people, gave the work a great deal of heart and emotional impact. Watchmen was also filled with scientific, political, and moral dilemmas, allowing Moore a platform to cleverly integrate his Anarchist philosophy within a meditation on the American mythology as expressed in the `superhero"".  It was Moore's critique on America.  And though much of its moral relativism and Cold War angst have aged poorly, the Watchmen exploded the expectations the public had for what comic books can be.  Released in `86, the book's challenging and extremely adult themes changed the perception of the entire art form and, by default, opened the door for a more serious approach to comic books on film.

Zack Snyder deserves a huge amount of credit for faithfully transplanting much of Moore's novel to the screen. Deemed ""un-filmable"" for many years, Snyder rode his 300 success and delivered a film that proved to be un-mountable for several talented directors including Terry Gilliam and Paul Greengrass.  Snyder's approach here was to simply treat the graphic novel as a sort of rough storyboards for the film. He hits most of the novel's most important ideas and plot points, expands the action and removes the side characters and background materials. It's a Cliff Notes approach, but it does manage to compress the book's expansive ideas into a fairly tight 190-minute film.  This is an accomplishment that must be acknowledged and applauded.

The film itself is more problematic. When I heard of its green light a couple of years ago, I questioned the relevance of WATCHMEN in this time. Will its Cold War era themes have any meaning? More importantly, will it's very concept hold any value in a marketplace that's already seen The Incredibles, X-Men, Dark Knight and Heroes? The ideas pioneered by The Watchmen have been plundered for more than 20 years now, and this fact remains an obstacle that Zack Snyder never completely overcomes.

WATCHMEN, like the graphic novel, begins with the murder of The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a brutal Government lackey whose own super brand of cynicism replaced every iota of heroism he may have ever possessed. His death sets Rorschach (Jackie Early Haley), a right-wing moralist vigilante and the movie's de facto protagonist, on a mission to uncover a vast conspiracy to kill off superheroes. He's aided by the meek Night Owl (Patrick Wilson) and the very hot Silk Spectre 2 (Malin Akerman). Then there's Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), a nuclear scientist who's been transformed into an omnipotent being and used by the U.S. to win Vietnam and keep the Russkies in check. Finally there's, Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), a wealthy industrialist whose monstrous altruism becomes the film's main moral dilemma. It's all beautifully realized, action packed, set to an occasionally inspired, but often clichd soundtrack, and confidently constructed. The dialogue is stiff, but the acting is descent; despite the reviews, I liked both Akerman and Goode. Billy Crudup's approach to Manhattan is both interesting and grounded. The film's star however, is clearly Jackie Earle Haley. His Rorschach (85% of which is behind a full mask) just crackles with energy and wit. Like a coiled spring, Haley gives this extremely unsympathetic character a charisma and depth that countinually thrilled and surprised me. It's a great little performance and I'm interested in seeing a lot more from this former former child star.

Everything else in WATCHMEN is uneven. I found myself alternately repulsed, thrilled, disappointed and entertained. I was never bored, but the film failed to impress me as a complete artwork. Like a roller coaster ride, it continually fluctuated between the highs and the lows; never really finding the footing to support its intellectual content. And, much like Dr. Manhattan, I found myself emotionally uninvolved; detached from what was happening before me.  Maybe it was the fact that I had recently re-read the novel and its ideas were not surprising to me anymore. Or maybe it was the fact that when he removed the Moore's details and multiple side characters, Snyder also removed much of what made Watchmen special in the first place.  He removed the novel's soul.",1244332800,48,4716,5.150326797385621
3579243,3,B001FB55H6,"Well, I could go with the masses on this one or I could be an individual and state my true feelings on this movie. When I went to see this movie in theaters, all of my friends loved it. I did not. My first issue with the movie was the music. The music in this movie was pointless 80s one hit wonders which while my friends all agreed that it accurately summed up the times which the characters lived in, I thought that they were almost totally inappropriate for all but two scenes the music was used in. Having read the novel, I also did not like how they made the movie scene for panel but decided to totally change and omit certain crucial elements such as the ending, which made the novel an excellent read. While the violence and sex were gratuitous the sex was comical and also awkward unlike in the book where Moore shows how it directly relates to the main characters ability to fight crime. The movie was also too long and started to drag after about an hour. I felt like I was in the movie theater for about 5 hours for a 2 hour and 30 minute movie. Dr. Manhattan was nude throughout the entire movie as well. Again this was another thing which Moore used to make a point in his book but was a pointless item to add into a movie of this sort.

In short, I left that movie theater thinking that Zack Snyder the director should stick to action movies such as 300 as the fighting was awesome although a minor part of the movie and he should never direct a movie meant to be a drama again. I was however able to be convinced by my friends that this was not a terrible movie but a decent movie. You should not see this if you've read the book however as you will inevitably hate this movie.",1244246400,3,1694,4.180428134556575
3579244,4,B001FB55H6,"Not familiar with the graphic novels, I can only state my opinion regarding the film. When I first saw the trailer for Watchmen, I instantly knew it was the greatest movie trailer I have ever seen, and probably will see. It was like nothing I had ever witnessed. I was hooked without knowing literally anything about the film, the comics, the characters, or the plot.

Upon watching it, I knew I liked it alot, but wasn't sure whether I loved it. With so much packed into movie that-even at 3 hours, is a bit short- I knew it would require multiple viewings before I could form a proper opinion. The plot is a bit confusing and so much is going on at the same time, that it becomes difficult to keep track of everything, unless you are familiar with the graphic novels, I assume.

Character-wise, I thought everyone did a fantastic job. Dr. Manhattan and Rorschach were my two faves. I love characters with depth and mystery, and they had both in abundance. The rest of the cast is just as strong and well-balanced in film.

The special effects are just ridiculously awesome. There really cannot be one single complaint about anything visual on screen.

Plot-wise, I think the director did a fine job in the allotted time and while convoluted and messy at times, it was still enjoyable enough to keep my interest for the entire film-and wish for even more.

A word of caution, though by now everyone probably has figured out that this film is quite adult in every regard and cannot be put in the same league as your standard comic book films. This is not Spiderman. It is not even Batman. This is a very graphic  anti-superhero film with enough blood, language, nudity, violence and sexual content to keep any ADULT happily engaged. I do not, under any circumstances, recommend anyone under the age of 17 to watch this.",1244160000,34,1819,4.598765432098766

My own view as to why it didn't clean up at the box office is because the movie is ahead of its time. When the graphic novel came out in the 1980s, comic readers were tired of the same old same old in comics. WATCHMEN came along and blew up the traditional superhero stereotypes.

A lot was said in interviews by the creators of the film that MOVIE audiences were tired of ""typical"" superhero movies (just as those comic readers were back in the 80s) and the timing was right for WATCHMEN to blow people's minds.

Well, it did and it didn't. For those who ""got"" the movie, mission accomplished. For most fans of the novel, mission accomplished. But for the ""masses"", it didn't quite work. I've read a lot of complaints about the film and there is a common thread running through them. Folks who didn't like the movie complain that it was not what they expected. In other words, it was not a typical superhero movie.

Now Blade Runner is generally considered (not by everyone, I know) one of the best science-fiction movies ever made. It has become a classic. It was ahead of its time and audiences eventually caught up.

I think the same will be said of WATCHMEN. Hollywood is cranking out superhero movies faster than we can watch them. Movie goers are loving the CGI and action sequences. We're eating it up! But the time is coming when you'll see a trailer for one of these and groan: ""My God, not ANOTHER superhero movie.""

And that's when it'll be time to check out WATCHMEN again. You might just see the movie a little differently then.

I'm convinced that WATCHMEN, like Blade Runner, will become a classic. I loved the movie. Saw it 5 times in the theater and will probably wear out the DVD. Zack Snyder stayed true to the source material, he didn't dumb it down. And the movie looks stunning! In my mind it is already a classic.

3579246,5,B001FB55H6,"I must admit, I really wasn't expecting this.  I had anticipated seeing yet another ""superhero movie"" and being visually entertained for a couple hours, but this adaptation of the allegedly legendary graphic novel Watchmen far exceeded my initial expectations.  David Hayter, who last wrote the first two X-Men movies, really outdid himself in writing this epic 160-minute film.
 Set in the 1980s, Watchmen focuses on a handful of superheroes whose servitude to the world neither seems wanted nor necessary, with the exception of the enigmatic and omnipotent Dr. Manhattan.  When one of the Watchmen is murdered at the beginning of the movie, it sets the stage for a jam-packed tale centered around questions of revenge and the human condition.  Unlike other superhero movies I've seen in the past, not only do you have dazzling special effects and a multitude of action sequences, but the accompaniment of blood, gore, nudity, sex, and swearing.  This, coupled with the dark imagery pervading the film, does a fantastic job of making the movie an adult feature, rather than a just torrent of guys and girls in tights kicking each others' rear ends.  Heavily emotive and extremely interesting flashbacks show the history behind the characters if you, like me, am not aware of the details behind the graphic novel (which I believe gave me a distinct advantage).
 The plot gives the feeling of a true crime type of movie, which further allows one to view the story as more of a tragedy than a simple action movie.  The acting is particularly well done, and I was pleasantly surprised to see Jackie Earle Haley as one of the main characters (his last performance that I saw in Little Children made this role even more unexpected).  The aforementioned special effects, though fantastic, don't overshadow the movie itself, and the mysterious orchestral score adds suspense and trepidation.  To further the impression of a dark drama set in the past, the score is peppered with songs from Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, Jimi Hendrix, and others.  Though the movie was nearly three hours long, I was never bored and yet was consciously aware of its length.
 All in all, I hope (and believe) that Watchmen will open the door for more mature and adult-themed superhero films with R ratings, and being the first one of its kind, does a damn good job of setting the bar for those of its kind yet to come.  If you're looking for superhero action mixed with Dark Knight-styled imagery and lots of extras, you simply can't get any better than this.",1243728000,7,2533,4.88785046728972
3579247,5,B001FB55H6,"Watchmen, the film based on the novel of the same name, is one hell of a movie.

The film, like the book, tells the story of a super-hero world where there's only one that's super and not that many that are heroic. It's an alternate 1985, where America won the Vietnam War thanks to Doctor Manhattan, the only one of the Watchmen with super powers, and where Richard Nixon was elected to a fifth term. Vigilantes are banned, but that doesn't stop the disturbed, and disturbing, Rorschach, a masked crusader who read Ayn Rand and didn't get the joke.

The movie begins with the murder of the Comedian, a former masked hero and US government operative. Rorshach begins investigating that and quickly starts to think there's more than meets the eye, and that someone's out to get the former heroes. Along with his only friend, Nite Owl II, he starts uncovering what might be the largest conspiracy ever.

The film is a visual feast of immense proportions (rather like Doctor Manhattan's penis, which you'll see more of than you wanted). The sights up on the screen, particularly on Mars, are stunning, and the effects are nearly perfect, even the most mundane ones. There's a couple shots that I would've sworn were filmed in New York City (the movie was shot in Vancouver).

The acting is just as good, especially by Jackie Earle Haley was Rorschach. He's got the voice and the manerisms down pat from the comic. The other roles are rounded out just as well, even those that are people impersonating real historical figures (though Nixon's nose was way too long).

As for the script, it was quite good, and though, yes, the ending is changed from the graphic novel, it keeps the overall theme intact and, frankly, works better than the giant squid thingy.

Overall this was a very good movie, though not for everyone. Do yourself a favor and go see it while it is still in theatres, cause it will suffer greatly on the small screen.",1243728000,,1930,4.661764705882353

3579250,4,B001FB55H6,"Brutally honest review from a die hard fan of the graphic novel

It has been a long time coming, but the wait is over. After spending some twenty years in development hell, we finally have the long-awaited film adaptation of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon's classic graphic novel ""Watchmen"". Zack Synder, the director behind ""300"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"", brings up a very faithful film based on the novel. Now, the graphic novel itself is a landmark in the comic book industry, Released as a 12-part series between 1986 and 1987, it changed the graphic medium forever, winning countless awards including the Hugo Award, and being on Time Magazine's list of ""100 Best English Speaking Novels since 1923"". That's a lot to live up to for Synder and crew. But Synder being a big fan, the rest of us felt that the film was in good hands. But was it a good movie? I'm here to say that the film is the closest thing anyone will ever come to in adapting the novel into a film, but it's not necessarily a good thing. Fans of the novel, and those who may have just read it before the movie will follow the film with ease but newcomers may have a challenge. Included now is information regarding the newly released Director's Cut of the film, which fixes the movie and makes it even better.

THE STORY

The story revolves around a group of former superheroes. There is Dan Dreiberg, who used to be the Nite Owl; Laurie Juspecyzk who used to be Silk Spectre; Adrian Vedit who is Ozymandias; Rorschach, who still dons the costume; and Dr. Manhattan, a blue man with actual superpowers. One of the heroes, The Comedian, is murdered. The murder is suspicious and Rorschach believes that there could be a plot to kill masked-heroes. All the while, America and Russia are on the brink of nuclear war. The government has created a ""Doomsday Clock"" which is a physical representation of how close mankind is to extinction. The clock stands five minutes to midnight throughout most of the film, midnight being the end of the human race. The film does a great job of adapting the story into film, including altering the ending in a more realistic way that almost seems better than the novel's. Much of the novel is told in backstory and it's no different in the film. The films starts with the Comedian's death and goes into a lengthy credits roll giving flashbacks of the original crime fighters, the Minutemen, all the way to their predecessors, who the film calls the Watchmen. The Comedian's story is still intact in flashbacks as well as Dr. Manhattan's. Now, the narrative does suffer some. Some plot points just don't get fleshed out. Why were the costumed heroes outlawed? It's a huge subject in the book but doesn't get explained the film and it's crucial that we know that. In the Director's Cut, there is an extended scene when Dan visits Hollis Mason (the original Nite Owl) and they see a news report about Rorschach which tells of the Keene Act, which outlawed masked vigilantes. This scene alone fixes so much with the story. Character development suffered a bit as well. We don't get to see why the Comedian is the way he is or how he perceives the world. It's such a huge concept in the book that readers completely understand but I don't think movie-goers will get. Again, the Director's Cut fixes this problem. The flashback sequences at the Comedian's funeral have been extended to show more of the Comedian's almost Nazi nature and how he treats people. One such scene is the extended scene of the Watchmen meeting hosted by Ozymandias. We see more of his view on the world. His character is definitely improved. Another character who suffered in the theatrical cut was Laurie, or Silk Spectre. We didn't get her on screen as much as we should have. The Director's Cut has added in many scenes with Laurie. A few scenes show how she hates her ""job"", where she has to make sure Dr. Manhattan doesn't get upset. The Mars sequence with her and Dr. Manhattan is extended further showing how their relationship has been crumbling. We finally get that her character is suffering from her relationship with Manhattan and her mother, and how she has lost her sense of identity. Also there's an added scene showing her first encounter with the Comedian which comes later in her revelation that he's her father (which is in the theatrical cut). This added scene makes her revelation not seem so spontaneous and fresh but makes the viewer think of that earlier scene and go ""oh wow, I should've seen that!"". Also, more Rorschach has been added to the Director's Cut giving the audience more depth into his character and more journal entries but more importantly, his scene with the psychologist is extended. Also to humor the novel's fans, they added in the line where Rorschach states that Adrian is a possible homosexual.

THE PRODUCTION

The film is a technical masterpiece. The production design, special effects, fight choreography, and costume design is amazing. The film looks like it popped right out of the book. New York in 1985 looks gritty and decaying, just like in the novel. Sets like the Owl Ship were a spectacle to behold for fanboys. In the Director's Cut, we see a lot more of New York and really get the sense of this decrepit city full of sex and murder. As Rorschach says, ""the night brings fornication and bad consciouses"" and you get that vibe. The color palettes mimic that of the graphic novel but entirely. I mean, having a movie filled with purples, oranges, and greens for the environment would've been silly. The Karnack set was beautiful, really bringing in Veidt's obsession with Egypt and ancient artifacts into view. The actors portray their parts wonderfully, although Malin Akerman as Silk Spectre and Matthew Goode as Veidt didn't do as well a job as they should. Goode was perfect for Veidt but he said many of his lines too quick and some words were cluttered up. For reference, listen to his interview towards the beginning of the movie and see if you can spot the word ""Antarctica"". I had to watch it five times to actually realize what he said. Some say Billy Cuddrup was too monotone for Manhattan but look at it this way: Manhattan not human, he doesn't give a damn for humans, it's not clear if he feels any emotion, what do you expect from him for a voice? Cuddrup did a great job as Manhattan and his performance in the film brings the art of motion capture technology to a whole level. On another note, the costumes were great. The clothes the actors wore felt 1980s and the their hero costumes were either like the novel or even better. Nite Owl's costume is definitely a step up from the novel, even though it bears resemblance to Batman. Silk Spectre's costume is drop dead sexy and no man will leave the theater not wanting their wife or girlfriend to don the suit. There aren't as many fight scenes as one would hope but the few that are there are choreographed very well. The prison fight scene where Nite Owl and Silk Spectre go to break out Rorschach is very good. One of the major issues the film suffered from was editing. Some scenes just ended and went into another and didn't feel right. The transition from Dr. Manhattan screaming ""Leave Me Alone!"" on television to teleporting on Mars was really quick and confusing. Luckily, the Director's Cut fixed it by showing that Manhattan teleported everyone out and there was an added scene of Dan and Laurie with the aftermath of their alley fight. Overall, the editing was fixed with the Director's Cut leaving us with a film that feels complete. The pacing has been fixed and the overall rhythm of the story telling feels natural and good.

THE MUSIC

Tyler Bates returns to compose for Snyder and again we are disappointed. This movie deserved a score of epic proportions with deep, emotional pieces for the themes and story but the music was a bad mix of orchestral and electronic. But I can't say the movie didn't fit the movie. It certainly set the mood and some pieces were actually nice. The one part that upset me the most, musically, was the detonation of the energy reactor in New York. There was a moment when an energy bubble was growing and there was this dramatic chorus and orchestra that really gave me chills. I wish it lasted longer like during the explosion. God, that would've brought me to tears. Also, the song choice was very bland. While they used songs whose lyrics were used on the novel, the actual songs didn't fit into the story. I mean, playing Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" during Nite Owl and Silk Spectre's sex scene made the audience laugh. It set the mood right for the moment but I didn't like it. Also, other songs like Jimi Hendrix's cover of ""All Along the Watchtower"" during Rorschach and Nite Owl's crash landing in Antarctica made no sense at all.

THE ENDING

As we've heard before, the ""squid"" is out. Instead they went for a more realistic approach which I believe was good. In the novel, Vedit engineered a giant squid monster which explodes when teleported and thus destroying half of New York. The attack makes it look like an alien invasion and brings the world together out of war. The movie is almost the same. For the past few years, Veidt and Manhattan have been working on energy reactors hoping that they can solve the world's energy crisis and make cheap renewable energy so that war may be obsolete. What Manhattan doesn't know is that he has been helping Veidt replicate his energy signature. Veidt uses that energy signature and teleports his reactors to different cities around the world in which he detonates them, killing millions. The destruction leaves behind Manhattan's energy so it looks like he did it. So the war ends and the world unites against Manhattan. Seems better than the novel's ending and it makes more sense and is more plausible. The rest is the same: Manhattan kills Rorschach so that Rorschach won't tell, Manhattan leaves the galaxy, and the world is united. Actually the squid is in the movie. Not it's squid form though. If you look closely at the scene where Laurie leaves Manhattan, check out the tv screen with Adrian in it. Behind Adrian is a sign with an acronym for the project he and Manhattan are doing. Notice anything?

DIFFERENCES WITH THE DIRECTOR'S CUT

As you've read before, I stated many improvements that the Director's Cut has made. The characters are fleshed out more this time around and the pacing of the story is much better. The theatrical cut seemed like they crammed too much into too little time. That extra 24 minutes makes a lot of difference. Some of the best aspects of this cut is that there are added scenes further explaining how Rorschach unraveled the mystery of Pyramid Transnational. There's a scene where he breaks into the assassin who tried to kill Veidt and finds he was working for Pyramid. That scene alone adds so much into the understanding of the story. Also, there's a few extended scenes with Dan and Hollis Mason, giving more of Hollis's character. Added in, is Hollis Mason's death. The gang known as the Mop Tops mistaken Hollis for Dan's Nite Owl after Dan sprung Rorschach out of prison. This upsets the gang and they murder Hollis. This scene is pretty emotional. Hollis fights back and as he punches each person, we see a flashback of an old enemy of the original Nite Owl's that he's punching. It's very dramatic and almost tear-jerking if you're a fan of the novel and feel for the character (it doesn't help having that sad music, the Intermezzo from ""Callaveria Rusticana""). Overall, the Director's Cut fixes the confusing editing of the scenes, the characters, the pacing of the film, and the story telling. If you haven't seen ""Watchmen"", start here. If you've seen the theatrical cut, you'll never watch it again after seeing the new scenes. This movie feels complete and as Snyder says, it IS the Watchmen movie.

CONCLUSION

The film does leave the audience in thought. The consequences of war, the human condition, the price of peace, all run through the heads of audience members upon leaving the movie. Although the film was done extraordinarily well, I really think newcomers to the story might have left the theater confused and wanting some explanations. Luckily, the Director's Cut offers fans more of they wanted and newcomers a much better and improved film to start with. All in all, the film is extraordinary and just a great movie.

Watchmen is based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. It's a very well done adaptation. I've read the graphic novel twice, so I was excited to see this movie.

And what an awesome movie it was!

I was a bit skeptical about the almost 3-hour length (I don't have A.D.D), but in the end I was completely satisfied. I saw it with 3 people who hadn't read the graphic novel, and they even loved it too. I was very shocked though that there were kids at this movie, as if the rating 18A for ""Gory Scenes, Brutal Violence"" wasn't enough of a warning?

The year is 1985. Nuclear War is a high threat. The doomsday clock has been set to 5 minutes to midnight. And an ex-superhero has been murdered. The Comedian (played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan), has been thrown out a window to his death. Upon this happening, the minutemen, now called the Watchmen, a washed-up ex-ensemble of superheroes has reunited to to one thing- save the world from nuclear threat.

Watchmen is a brilliant movie. At 2 hours and 43 minutes it doesn't overstay its welcome. In fact I actually didn't want it to end. The entire cast was brilliant. The movie isn't as humorless as everyone says it is, there's lots of dry humor where appropriate, there is lots of action, and another thing is that it fits the ""problems of society"" feel that the comic created. Also the omissions were not as bad as people are exaggerating it to be- I must admit I liked the changed ending a lot better than the book ending. It's more realistic, and I must admit the book ending made me go ""WTF"".

I shall warn you though, this movie is very violent and gory. I am a gorehound, and I found myself cringing and going ""Ewwwwww"" at a few bits. Do not see this if you are squeamish, because it IS very brutal and gruesome stuff.

So overall, I have not one single complaint about this film, because it's an amazing work of art. This is brutal and and gruesome stuff that if hard to watch, and I love it. Consider it Snyder's masterpiece! I can't wait to get it on Blu-Ray when it comes out!",1241481600,2,2303,4.354312354312355

Dr. Manhattan is supposed to be a brilliant research scientist before his accident, yet he is stupid enough to accidentally walk into ground zero of an experiment that he likely designed and scheduled. The odds that he'd even be leaving the building to go somewhere else while such an important experiment in his department is going is implausible, much less a man of such intelligence being so absent-minded to walk into a dangerzone that he designed and oversees. SECONDLY, where are the security measures to prevent someone from walking in the wrong place and dying or being mutated? I'm willing to suspend my disbelief pretty easily, but this is just stupid. Would you believe Einstein made a weapon, scheduled a test, and then walked in front of it because he forgot his hat? Come on.

The idea of the universe being a clock without a clock maker is the most nonscientific fairytale that could exist. Science involves determining the contents of an object and then determining where those contents came from and how they came together to form the current object, what is keeping them together currently, and lastly what will happen to them in the future. The clock without a maker is more ridiculous than saying a magic fairy came along and went, ""Poof, here's your clock."" At least in the magic fairy scenario, there is a cause and effect theory in place. There is no cause and effect in a clock without a maker, and science is cause and effect. The clock without a clockmaker is effect (existence) without a cause. Is the magic fairy example ridiculous? Sure it is. That's my entire point. It's completely ridiculous, and it's still more scientific than the clock without a clockmaker. The mere idea that one of the smartest scientists who ever lived could believe such nonsense is beyond ludicrous.

The editing is terrible. There is no reason to show The Silk Spectre II making up with her mother in the end. No one cares. Her mother is not on screen enough for anyone to care about her. We barely care about The Silk Spectre II as it is, much less her mother.

Now the nudity. I saw this in a packed IMAX theater on opening night with diehard fans. You won't ever get more of a receptive audience than that. The first 12 times they showed Manhattan's penis, the crowd kept quiet. By the 50th penis flash the entire audience of 400 people or more were laughing and mocking the movie. When your entire audience laughs at your gratuitous nudity that yields nothing to the plot, you failed. Isn't that the same thing that 80s horror movies are ridiculed for? It's not art in the Watchmen and trash in Friday the 13th Part 7. That audience was the ideal one for this movie, and the constant nudity was unanimously labeled ridiculous.

The fact that The Nite Owl II and The Silk Spectre II are so cowardly in the big confrontation scene destroys any sympathy or interest in them. The end result does not justify the means. There is no reason for them to be so spineless and compromising in the end.

There are good things in this mix though.

The acting is pretty solid all around. The problems are not with the execution in making the movie, but the original idea in the first place. Rorschach is an awesome character portrayed perfectly. The scenes with Rorschach are so good that it's a shame there are so many other problems with the film. The decision he makes in the end is awesome. Rorschach is interesting enough to make a movie/graphic novel entirely about him.

The lighting and cinematography made it beautiful to look at. The only problem is sifting through all of the above garbage to get to it is not worth the effort.

I am a comic book fan, and this is the worst movie I've seen this year.",1241481600,10,3854,4.614598540145986
3579274,5,B001FB55H6,"I've never even heard of ""Watchmen"" until the trailers for the movie came out. And I thought those trailers were mediocre at best. I thought, ""Great, another cartoonish looking movie.""

Man, was I wrong. Way WRONG!

After watching this movie, I think by FAR it is the best ""super hero""  movie EVER MADE PERIOD.

Even better than ""Dark Knight"".

3579275,4,B001FB55H6,"If anything were ever impossible to translate to film, it's Watchmen. To think a screenplay by a sub-par writer directed by a stylish but over-the-top director would achieve this translation with any modicum of success is mindblowing if you're anywhere near as cynical as i am. This is a surprisingly good movie and if you have any interest in seeing it, you should (and since this review contains spoilers, you should have already seen it). However, there's a few bruises on this pretty face, the majority of which are superficial, but at least one has lead to severe brain damage under the surface. I'm of course referring to the ending, but clearly I'm getting ahead of myself.

The acting in this movie simply must be praised. Rorshack's portrayal is eerily perfect and makes the movie. They could have cut every scene he wasn't in and called this Rorshack: The Movie and it'd still be a masterpiece. Most of the other actors are nearly as good, especially Dan/Nite Owl's. Silk Spectre doesn't come across as particularly captivating, but i was never especially blown away by her character in the graphic novel, so that's a wash. Adrian Viedt is the only casualty in the cast. His portrayal is a slap in the face to anyone who liked his character in the graphic novel. Probably to give the movie a tangible foe closer to Rorshack's black-and-white view of the world and farther from the comic's shades-of-gray theme, Viedt is arrogant from the beginning and a total bastard by the end. Part of me suspects his new German accent, which he hides from the public but uses around the heroes he ends up antagonizing, is supposed to make him seem more malicious, maybe even foreshadowing his killing of, let's say, 6 million innocent people (as opposed to the half million or so he kills in the comic). Perhaps worst of all, his cat Bubastis is cut out of all the scenes in which it establishes Viedt as having a loving attachment to another creature, but it shows up without any reason or explanation for the scene in which Viedt kills it. There is some effort made to earn him some sympathy, but i can't imagine anyone walking away from this movie seeing Viedt as anything but a monster, and that's just wrong.

The fight scene in the alleyway with our ""heroes"" pointlessly brutalizing the street thugs who attacked them is gut-wrenching, not because the violence is way, WAY over the top, but because it's entirely pointless, given too much focus for too long, and has those involved acting entirely out-of-character. The soundtrack ranges from cool and poignant to glaringly out-of-place and silly. Renaming the Crimebusters the Watchmen is just tacky and insulting to the viewer, not to mention changes the title from clever and deep to typical Hollywood trash. This nitpicking, however, is inconsequential compared to movie's ending, which fills me with woe. If an entity America claims responsibility for attacks the entire world, wouldn't the immediate response be to destroy America, not declare a truce with them? How do they intend to fight a being who single-handedly won the Vietnam War in a week and, they believe, nuked a bunch of major cities simultaneously as some kind of ""warning""? What happens when they realize their enemy has left Earth forever (which would be almost immediately, since he was well-known to be on the verge of doing so anyway)? The more you think about it, the less sense it makes, ultimately becoming utter gibberish, unlike the original ending, which gradually makes more sense as you contemplate it.

Nevertheless, this movie is great, and a miracle considering the source material and the people responsible for it. It just has to be said that it doesn't hold a candle to the graphic novel (except to burn out the last chapter and hastily replace it with crude scribbles and nonsense).",1240012800,3,3826,4.856049004594181
3579276,4,B001FB55H6,"It's not often an adaptation comes along that consciously tries not to veer too much from the source material.  I went into this movie having read the comic and found the same problems and genius in both.  Thankfully, the latter greatly outweighed the former.  There's little point in delving too greatly into what most reviewers found negative -- the stilted love scenes and the phoned-in performances of half the cast -- so I can only review here what, to me, the story and the imagery meant.

As a piece of cinema, ""Watchmen"" has been unfairly treated as mere comic book fare.  The fact that it was meant to provoke thought and change how we view heroes (among other brainy topics) was largely ignored by the American market.  That has been reflected in its lackluster box office starting with week two of its release.

It's a shame that all too often we as moviegoers look at a film on a bland surface level and only critique a par of quality based on other movies.  What I figured out after reading the comic, and was hit in the face after watching the film, is that ""Watchmen"" is about archetypes, symbolism, and a hard look at our own culture.  Every costumed crusader represents a facet of crime-fighting comic heroes: Manhattan is the god-like power; Rorschach is the Batman-esque thirst to avenge crime; Night Owl II is a bored rich kid; Silk Spectre II is obliged, etc.  Like a Star Trek world of extreme narrow behavior of its inhabitants, the Watchmen characters reflect what we think of ourselves and how we interact with society and all its ills.

If one looks past the bright colors and the shlock Hollywood aspect of catering to the masses with obligatory action film elements, you'll find that ""Watchmen"" is deep.  Very deep.  The only problem, is of course, its massive complexity.  My wife told me, when walking to our car, that she gave up trying to focus on details early into the movie and tried to look at the big picture.  Ah, I told her, the big picture is what's really important.  But she fully understood the meaning of the characters and the moral quandaries, ala ""Batman: The Dark Knight.""

I think my favorite line in the movie comes from the Comedian, in response to Night Owl II.  ""What happened to the American dream?"" Dreiberg asks.  Blake says ""This is the American dream.""  (Or something to that effect.)  Wow!  I got the energy of ""V For Vendetta"" in that moment: who is really watching over us, and why shouldn't we pay more attention?  We've achieved the American dream of prosperity and being lulled into security.  Ah, but what a paradox!  That moment of seeing Blake amidst the ruins of the riot and silhouetted against the wall of the American flag was brilliant.  He is the protector and the oppressor all in one; I'm so glad they kept his original costume from the comic: the red, white, and blue shoulder armor makes him a perverted Captain America at the same time that he brutally fires upon the discontented.

Who really watches the watchers?  Hopefully, after seeing this movie and digesting it a bit, we will.  The visceral nature of a film, full of bloody motion life and sound, will always hold that edge over print.  Although I prefer to think my way through stories and problems instead of simply watching them at 24 frames per second, I highly recommend ""Watchmen"" because of one reason:

It made me think.  And thinking is the foundation for any healthy society.",1239753600,3,3421,4.668896321070235
3579277,5,B001FB55H6,"I knew NOTHING of this comic prior to walking into the movie theater a couple of weeks ago, I came away throughly impressed.  In most ""Comic Book"" movies, the first thing sacrificed is dialogue.  Most times it hackneyed and more than a wee bit corny.  Watchmen, broke this mold.  The dialogue, cinematography, and the overall action is in a word, INCREDIBLE.  I recommend this flick if you're interested in a comic book movie that breaks the traditional mold of heroes, and villains, or simply, if you wish to see a great movie.  This one is so different than anything I've ever seen.  And, I see a HUGE amount of movies......

Speaking of huge.....

I could have done with MUCH less of Billy Crudup's blue tinted junk.

Other than this, I can wholeheartedly  recommend seeing this movie.  And, if I'm right, the DVD/Blu-Ray will bring even more exciting aspects to your screens at home.  I am really looking forward to the upcoming release.  I fully expect the DVD to be as incredible as the movie was in the theater.",1239494400,2,1018,4.646067415730337
3579278,5,B001FB55H6,I found this movie an extremly thought-provoking movie. Much like the grafic novel. It has the gore and main plot but alot was left out. In all I'd recommend reading the book first than seeing the movie. They are both fantastic though.,1239408000,2,235,4.619047619047619

3579280,5,B001FB55H6,"I had purchased the graphic novel of Watchmen a while before the movie came out and had read it when the movie came out.  The movie was absolutely amazing.  The visual effects were incredible, the acting was top notch, and the story followed as closely to the original concept as almost anything I've ever read.

I understand where all of the haters are coming from, questioning the morality or intent of this film.  Here is my rebuttal.. the story is supposed to question the impossible, make you think, stimulate those little hairs on the back of your neck.  This story is filled with philosophy and possibility.  These people are not trying to be Batman, Superman or Spider-Man.  It bears a very slight resemblance to the darkness that is Moore's Batman, but not even close character or plot wise.

To sum up, this film is terrific in my opinion.  It stays as true to the original story as possible and kept me entertained all the way through.  I will agree that if you have not read the comic book you will find it somewhat difficult to follow some of the story.  Dr. Manhattan is naked through a lot of the graphic novel so the movie simply stayed true to the comic book there.  The dry humor and gore maintained the integrity of the graphic novel as well.  Check this movie out, if only by renting it, but just bask in the cinematic glory that is this film.  Pay attention to the little things and you will enjoy this movie as I did.",1239235200,3,1439,4.46360153256705
3579281,4,B001FB55H6,"Escapist pap?  No.

WATCHMAN captured my imagination through its pre-release publicity.  It sounded interesting in many different ways.  Knowing nothing about the comic novel beforehand, suited my purpose.  First impressions mean a great deal to me, and I enjoy not knowing too much about the film I'm about to see.  (Difference between Opera and Movies.  With Opera, you study beforehand; you prepare to get the most out of the experience.  With Movies its just the opposite.  You don't prepare in any way in order that the experience will have a spontaneous effect.)  Anyway...

Reaction:  An unusual film on many levels, and a very good piece of enteretainment.  Intellectually?  The issues posed by the scenario are neither new, nor particularly urgent.  But, what fascinated me was the manner the director and writer used to manipulate those rarefied issues, from point to point, to heighten suspense and to add to the depth of the inquiry.  Intelligent and skillful.  Very rarely do I find myself wanting to see the movie again, immediately after first viewing, but with WATCHMEN I did.  Though WATCHMEN gave me nothing to care about, the flick gave me a few things to think about.  And so, although this was comparatively new ground in the cape and superpower genre, I was able to follow the story with growing interest from scene to scene.

The nudity of three of the characters in the story meant nothing, one way or another.  Not even the coital fakery of the Like Scenes added or detracted from the story.

The visualization was engrossing, and the effects, though often astonishing, did not detract from the story.  The acting was occasionally terrific (Rorschack.  Note:  How difficult is it to project a character, convincingly, through a head mask?  And to keep that character increasingly human?  Get ready for an unexpected tragedy.)  The pacing was excellent, throughout: Varied, never predictable.  All in all, one can say simply enough, WATCHMEN had DEPTH.  In this kind of comic book fantasy, is that or is that not rare?

What it hasn't got is humor.  Or, should I say, irony?  Or complexity?  The story is as flat as a slogan printed on cardboard.",1238976000,3,2170,4.936111111111111
3579282,5,B001FB55H6,"Very rarely does a movie come out that challenges all the quintessential themes of a specific genre.  In all other comic book or graphic novel adaptations, there is a seamlessness with which the transition to film takes place.  The stories translate, the characters remain relatively untouched.  Normally, everything follows the lead of previous editions.  Prepare for that lazy, albeit typically enjoyable, method of delivery to be flipped on its head.

The plot is almost stereotypically hero versus villain.  The bad guys come up with an ingenious plan, and the good guys eventually prevail.  Amazingly, however, the dismally dark portrayal of heroes, and the glossy veneer of villains, flips convention on its head.  In a world that has eschewed superheroes and driven them into hiding, a believable life alteration is necessary - this is NOT Superman simply putting on glasses and becoming Clark Kent.

The casting and acting for The Watchmen is infallibly perfect.  Each character delivers the overall purpose and essence of their character with flair and subtlety.

Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) is perfect in his role as a Batman in Dockers.  The most at peace with his forced retirement, he's old fashioned, and looks like a chemistry professor.

Malin Akerman's Silk Spectre was a tad boring, but overall she conveyed the true meaning of the character, the sultry, cute, vulnerable superhero following in her mother's footsteps.  Carla Gugino is an aged crime-fighter who misses the old days and reminisces through her daughter.  Fans of her performance in Sin City will not be surprised by the Gugino flashback sequences in which she blisters the screens.

The Comedian is perhaps the darkest of all heroes ever imagined.  He's vile yet he fights on the ""good"" side.  Completely comfortable with the ""break an egg to make an omelette""-philosophy, he blurs the line between black and white, and could easily be seen as protagonist as well as sociopathic antagonist.

Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) is a very compelling mastermind.  He believes his purpose is just, so his outward intentions do not come off as foreboding.  His choirboy looks only enforce the fact that he believes in his twisted intentions to save the world.  I'm unsure if the character's name is inspired by the poem, but the connection between each person's perception of invincibility, and eventual demise, is what creates each character's legacy.  In many ways Ozymandias could be viewed as The Comedian on a much grander scale.

Jackie Earle Haley's performance as Rorschach is absolutely one of my favorite performances of all time.  His brutal, madman form of justice is more enjoyable than DeNiro's character in Taxi Driver, more misanthropic towards contemporary culture than Col. Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, and a better comic transformation than Ledger's Joker.  It's amazing to think that the pipsqueak from Bad News Bears could be so convincingly rugged, so disturbed.

The one major flaw to this movie is the fact that Dr. Manhattan's digitally designed genitalia is on-screen roughly 50 times.  It's completely unnecessary and distracting.  Otherwise, I loved this movie; it's monumental, exciting, action-packed, and meaningful.  I highly recommend this movie for not only comic book fans, but anyone interested in an incredible story told through the lens of stunning cinematography.",1238889600,4,3367,5.274436090225564
3579283,5,B001FB55H6,"This is one of those rare films that comes along in a time when most fantasy films are just demo reels for stuntmen and effects men.  This film is thoughtful, dark, extremely cynical, and totally thought provoking.  It's one of those films that may have you disagreeing with its outcome or it's characters' motives, but you will be interested in them nonetheless.  This is like a comic book movie done through the lense of the brilliant auteur filmmakers of the late 60's and throughout the 70's.  I a high mark for filmmaking.  A high mark for adapting a previously published work.  A high mark of impactful visuals.  A high mark for actors, mostly unknown, making the unbelievable and fantastic real and relatable.  A high mark for art.  A high mark for writing.  It's that good, I swear.  And you don't have to be a Watchmen fan-boy to like it.  You just have to be an adult.  An intelligent, and always thinking pre-teen to teen.  Someone who loves what films can do for our mind and our eyes.  Someone who misses the days when films were made for more than the simple vegatation.  A time when every film wasn't polled and geared and marketed for 13 year olds.  Us adults do like some fantasy in our life, whether it be dark or not.

***No plot synopsis here.  My bad folks***

Lets start with the adaption.  It's been a while since I've seen something adapted so seamlessly to the screen.  I first picked up the Watchmen in graphic novel form back in the early 90's, I was about 12 years old.  I'd always heard that this film project was brewing for years.  I'd also heard that it was unfilmmable material.  Alan Moore himself, I believe, said it was unfilmmable.  I never understood this.  I read the thing at 12 and was imagining it as a film.  Hell, if you look at the panels and the way the book is structured, it's already very film-like.  Is it marketable, and does it hold mass appeal for the price tag it would cost, may have been the real question.  For about the first two hours the film is a direct adaption of the book.  Hell, even some of the visuals, and intercutting is taken from the novel.  The only thing I noticed omitted early on was the whole comic-within-the comic The Black Freighter.  That was one thing I guessed would be removed.  Where would it go, and how would it work in the context of a film narrative?  Well, guess what?  It was only omitted for the initial theatrical release.  Zach Snyder felt the Watchmen is incomplete without The Black Freighter, and he will be editing animated footage of the short story back into the film for a director's cut.  Can't wait to see how it plays out in the film form.  The third act is where things really start to change in adaption.
****SPOILERS****
Sorry, can't avoid them when talking about this and how much it helps the film version.  We lose the subplot involving the prison psychiatrist.  This I don't mind.  With the story itself, and the Black Freighter, I felt the novel was hammering its point home a little too hard with the inclusion of what the psychiatrist was going through when examing the imprisoned Rorshach.  Good omission.  Finally, the big change in plot has the same outcome but takes a short cut to get there.  In the novel the 'villain' cooks up a scheme involving a fake alien invasion that leads to New York's destruction.  The whole world unites to fight a common evil, forgets about their differences.  In the film the plot is less convoluted.  The 'Villain' no longer cooks up an alien invasion, but instead uses an already available resource in the body of Dr. Manhattan to derail nuclear destruction.  It makes the story tighter and further implicates one of the main characters into the action, makes him very important to the plot's outcome, and makes him less of a philosphical figure.  Sure, he's still expousing the meaning of life, but now he plays a part in it's course.  I never thought the idea of artists, scientists, and filmmakers being tricked into creating a genetic creature from scratch was that important.  It's interesting and wild, but way too convoluted in a story that's already fairly convoluted.  The film's solution to this problem is clever and simple.
***SPOILERS END***
The acting is all on spot on.  The relationship between the second Nite Owl and Silk Spectre II is done much better in the film.  It comes off more natural and believable here.  It's done with more visuals and less bloated exchanges.  Jackie Earle Haley(best known for his part in the original Bad News Bears, and his Oscar nominated performance in Little Children) lives and breaths Rorshach, arguably the most popular right wing vigilante this side of Rush Limbaugh.  He brings an already lively character to true life.  His performance is complex, playing a man who may be a lone nut, but never compromises his beliefs and suffers no one who doesn't fit into his own moral code.  Special attention must also be given to Billy Crudup and the special effects technicians behind Dr. Manhattan.  Crupdup's voice gives hints of a longing, a lost humanity trying to resurface.  Plus, the animation is subtle and effective on this character, to the degree of Gollum.  Sure, it's not as broadly animated, but it would be wrong for the character if he was.  Carla Gugino also stands out as Silk Spectre I.  Her performance and character is very complicated and not easily understood, especially by those who like to morally grandstand and brow beat others.  She brings a longing and tragedy to her small part.  Plus, is it just me, or does anyone else have the hugest crush on this actress?  She has that rare characteristic of combing cute and comfortable with totally hot and sexy.  Sorry, can't help, but after Sin City she gives me much joy-joy feelings.

Like I mentioned before, some of the visuals are directly taken from the comic, and all are fairly breathtaking.  It reminds me of Blade Runner.  The visuals are striking but don't overpower the narrative, and they don't feel like effects for effects sake.  Though, I do tire of the slow to fast ramping of speed in action sequences.  I think this effect stopped awing me right after The Matrix came out.  Zach Snyder has outdone himself with this one.  He has finally made a film that he will be expected to top in every future project.  I heard of him, directing music videos and commercials, as a contender for the remake of Dawn of the Dead.  I didn't feel that film should be remade, it's a horror classic, and his resume just made me guess for the worst.  Low and behold, the film worked.  Sure, it was more a straigh action piece, but the characters, visuals and acting was all top notch.  It was a fun, fast paced piece of fluff of the highest caliber.  Then came 300.  Wasn't as enthralled with this one as much as everyone else was.  I found it striking and mostly entertaing.  I didn't really care about any human body in that film.  They all just seemed like cyphers.  They fought and killed and died, and I didn't really care outside the visuals.  I found it to be an example of something that jumped off the page but sunk on the screen.  He has 100% redeemed himself with Watchmen.  It's fast paced, despite its almost three hour running time, spritely, and visually beautiful and horrifying all in one stroke.

This flick is almost fan-boy proof.  Sure, there will always be that small purist contigent that take Alan Moore's word as gospel, and they will openly loathe the film whether they secretly like it or not.  Moore himself should be open to this film and take a load off.  Hollywood did right by him for once.  Though, after League of Extraodinary Gentlemen, I understand where the dude is coming from.

PEOPLE WHO SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM:

1. If graphic violence bothers you, even though it's brief and not often, just stay away.  Nobody wants to hear your empty tiatribes about how violent films are and how they are destroying the fabric of America, a country itself which is considered one of the most violent in the West.
2.  Purist, uncompromising fan-boys.  Save it.  Nobody is interested in whether you're a bigger fan of Watchmen, or a more devoted deciple.  We get it.  You read it.  You loved it.  You paste the faces of your favorite Watchmen character on the bodies of silicon enhanced Playboy Bunnies in your room.  Move on...please.
3. Action junkies aka vegatables use films as something to pass the time between the next video game.  This film has action, and excitement but it's besides the point and not the reason for its existance.  I hear the Rock just released a remake of Escape to Wich Mountain.  Check that out instead.  Instantly satisfying.  Hyperactive.  Speical effects and star personality driven.  Instantly forgettable and undemanding.
4. Folks who can't remove their politics from their movie going experiences.  People who actually believe Hollywood is involved in some mass conspiracy to warp your children's morals, and to turn them into extreme lefty socialists.  Please, stop.  Just stay home.  It's just a fantasy parable about super heroes, and what their existance would do to our past history in the 20th century.  Nixon sucked.  It's a fact.  There will never be a 6 dollar bill with Reagans face on it, and he certainly won't get a spot on Mount Rushmore.  You guys had your shot.  The extreme religous disease that invaded your party has corrupted your principles and core ideals.  Deal with them, and let the rest of us risk our brains with this piece of thoughtful pulp fiction.
5. Finally, all those who fear change, or the fact taht writers like to transcend and disect material as Americana as apple pie.  This is not a kid's movie.  It's rated accordingly.  The definitions of right and wrong, and what makes a hero is turned on its head and hypothesised in situations that most super hero fims don't dare venture into.  It's not Superman.  It's not Spider-Man.  It's not just visceral pop entertainment, even though it's that too, it's got ideas.  It will make you think.  It might make you angry.  It might make you feel justified.  The bottom line is it will make you think and maybe even start some involved discussions.  Ones that moves beyond how 'Kewl' the special effects were.  Then, you'll stop and say, ""Hey, are we really talking in this much depth about a flick involving rubber clad super heroes, and a glowing blue guy who chills on Mars?""  Yup, you are.

See it.  Don't see it.  Like Blade Runner and other films of this type, it won't matter how much dough the flick makes or how much everyone and their grandma likes it.  This will live on while films like Spider-Man 3 and Iron-Man just end up being time filler on TNT.

2-DISC DIRECTOR'S CUT DVD UPDATE 7/12/2009
Well, any internet Watchment fanboy could tell you, but this isn't quite the director's cut released next week.  It's got an additional 24 minutes of footage that adds some more texture and reinstates Hollis' death scene and Night Owl's bloody revenge.  Plus, some of the action scenes have been beefed up, especially the jail break scene.  It's basically the entire novel minus the Black Freighter.  Fret not, this version will be released again on Dec. 9th, 2009 with the Black Freighter animated short  woven into the film just like the novel in a five disc Ultimate Edition set.  The Ultimate set will have a new commentary by the director on the first two discs, the entire partially animated graphic novel on the next two discs, and on the fifth will be all new unreleased behind the scenes stuff including the mockumentary Under the Hood, which was previously released on the Black Freighter dvd.  Hell, this month's release comes with a ten dollar rebate towards the Ultimate Edition.  I'm most certainly going to be going in for the 'ol double dip.

This director's cut has a second disc with some special features on it, even a couple more on the Blu-Ray, three to be exact, four if you include the useless digital copy.  We get a My Chemical Romance music video that is in step with the film's tone but will most likely only be viewed once.  We also get a half hour doc concerning the novel's creation and genesis that goes all the way up to the film's creation.  Oddly, the film's screenwriters aren't interviewed regarding the novel's adaption.  There are extenssive interviews with the filmmakers, DC artists and publishers, and Dave Gibbons, of course.  Then you get several short but informative webisodes regarding the costumes, vehicles, design, story, and costumes.  The webisodes go more into the hows and less into the why's, but they are quite satisfying.  And that's it.

A bunch of folks are going to piss and moan regarding the double dip, a double dip that has been old news since the film's original theatrical release, but not me.  I'm happy to have a version with the Black Freighter and one without.  I'm also happy to have the Black Freighter seperately.  Sure, I already bought the moving comic, but I think I know some folks who can take it off my hands happily.  I can't wait to hear director Zack Snyder's commentary in December.  The only thing I can live without is the theatrical cut, and I don't have to have it this way.  Listen, gripey fanboys, don't buy this version or do.  Just rent it if you don't want to double dip.  Buy it and ask for the Ultimate Edition for a Christmas present.  See?  I just solved all the major problems in your life.  Thank me.

PS:  Yes, that's a man's penis!  Grow up.  No, these aren't your mom and pops' super heroes.  No, there still isn't a giant alien squid thingy.  THERE WILL NEVER BE A GIANT ALIEN SQUID!  Deal.  The movie is better for this change from the novel.  Trust me.  And finally, the soundtrack and source music placement is PERFECTION!  Especially, ""Unforgettable"" for the opening scene and ""99 Red Balloons"" for Night Owl's and Silk Spectre's reunion date.  Stop being so narrow and simple.  Think about the whys and the placemnt and it will all become clear and way more fun.  Try thinking in a more gutteral manner, how the songs feel and not their literal meaning.  Again, trust me, they work.  If not, and you still don't see it or agree, well, um, then well........ then keep being boring????",1238112000,13,14215,4.659943525615168
3579284,5,B001FB55H6,"And that, in a nutshell, is what is great and not so great about ""Watchmen"".  I must apologize for being esoteric, but if I explain it I would be guilty of spoilers.  It should suffice to say that said ""Archie"" scene was both a defining moment of this films wonderful human elements and gratuitous to the point of being tedious.  That said, one scene, or 6 or 7 for that matter, were not enough to spoil my enjoyment of a film by a guy who has made one of my least favorite films (300).  If you haven't realized by now, this is never an easy film, yet I was surprisingly up to the challenge.  Before I really start to ramble on, I'd better chop this up a little.

REDEMPTION FOR ZACK SNYDER?
It sure sounds like I'm picking a fight (who, ME?) but I have my reasons.  For better or worse, Zack has made a name for himself by bringing comic books to life on screen (excuse me, ""Graphic Novels"" puh-lease!).  His first big hit ""Sin City"" was pretty successful and highly regarded.  I'll be damned if I'll ever get to see it.  It's been on my list for years.  Yet, I'll take the word of those who liked it.  Next was ""300"".  What can I say that my ""300"" review didn't; it was a silly cartoon based on one of the greatest last stands in human history.  Though faithful to the equally goofy comic... ...excuse me; GRAPHIC NOVEL (yeesh!) I thought it was highly overrated and translated poorly to the cinema.  So, knowing he directed ""Watchmen"" was not working as an endorsement for me.  In fact, I had great trepidation that this would be another nutty ""300"" with cartoon violence and gratuitous sex.  I was right.

I'M NOT A FAN OF NOIR COMIC BOOKS (or ""Graphic Novels"")
I almost bought this book.  But as I leafed through it at the book store, I decided I would pass on its meager 1940's style graphics and tiny word bubbles.  This was all done for a great purpose that the comic geeks could tell you about, but it wasn't pulling me in.  I'm not a big fan of the trend towards dark comics with dystopian alternate realities either.  I don't mind troubled characters but I want them to succeed on some level and at least live in a normal, screwed up world.  A world on the brink of self destruction is a bit too heavy for me. Besides, I don't like clouding my judgment of a film by reading the book first.  I work in reverse order.  This book has all the things I don't want in a comic and the film followed suit.

GRATUITOUS IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH A WORD
There was a point in this movie when I leaned over to my friend (yes, I have a couple) and whispered; ""is this what they mean by ""blue movie""?"".  My friend chuckled.  You see, the god-like Dr. Manhattan, who always glows in a blue light, was getting it on with the ""Silk Specter"".  So, they were having sex in blue light.  Ok, it's not so funny when you read it, but I thought it was a good one.  Anyway, like 300, sex scenes seem to be sprinkled in just for kicks.  Now I'm not against sex in general, but as the saying goes; been there, done that.  Though sex actually does enhance some moments of the film (the ""Archie"" scene I alluded to earlier) it really does nothing to move the plot along.  In fact the ""Archie"" scene was more of a comedic moment than the steamy hot moment it was depicted to be.  I guess super heroes with ED require different cures.  It's funny what can float your boat (you'll just have to see it).  Regardless, this might have been the only time in the film where I got a little bored (crazy, I know).  This doesn't sound so bad until you see Dr. Manhattan getting all up in your face with his schlong for extended periods.  I'm not particularly prudish about full frontal nudity when handled properly, but this was a bit much.  This blue god-man was every man's worst locker room nightmare; the naked guy who acts like he's dressed.  You know the one.  He walks around without a towel and insists on carrying on conversations with his wanker hanging in your face.  You can tolerate this for a minute or two, but he insists on walking around like this for 20 minutes or so.  That's how Dr. Manhattan comes across in this movie.  I don't want to get into his god-like mindset (what god needs cloths?), I just don't need to see him, or a woman for that matter, standing there naked ALL THE TIME!  I'm a big believer in sexual teasing in films.  There's nothing more arousing than that.
 I haven't even touched on the violence in this film.  Unlike ""300"" with its CG blood spraying everywhere, ""Watchmen"" holds back a little more.  Yet there is no shortage of dismemberment, face-smashing, bone-popping brutality.  Though the action is limited, I thought it was well staged and not nearly as posed as in ""300"".  I kind of enjoyed that part of it.  So, in review; Sex and nudity is too much.  Bone crushing brutal violence is OK.  As twisted as that sounds it was all gratuitous to the nth degree.

IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CHARACTERS
I wouldn't say ""Watchmen"" has a particularly great or original story.  What makes it original are its characters.  You've got a guy who's a lot like Batman on the surface, yet nothing like Batman in demeanor.  You've got a hero who is only a hero based on which side he's on.  Some call these types ""anti-heroes"".  I call them A-holes.  You've got slutty vulnerable women heroes who kick butt; very cool.  You've got a guy who is nothing like Batman on the surface, but has an even deeper, demented lack of compromise when it comes to justice.  You've got the genius hero trying to save humanity with big swings and you've got the Goddish Dr. Manhattan who muddies the waters with his fading touch with humanity.  What you end up with is a bunch of gifted people with all their warts and flaws trying, for the most part, to do the right things even if it kills us.  As far as superheroes go, they mostly appear to be highly skilled fighters with mysterious enhanced strength or agility.  Even though you never truly understand how most of the characters came by there special abilities, it never really is that important to know with the exception of Dr. Manhattan.  The biggest bummer of them all is that my favorite character bites the big one in the end.  The great thing is I cared.

WHO'S WATCHING THE WATCHMEN?  I AM!!
It's no big surprise then that I loved this movie.  Despite never having read the book, despite my disdain for the genre and Zack Snyder, despite what I felt was overwrought sexuality (crazy, I know) and despite a story that wasn't great, I loved this movie.  I was entertained for almost the entire 3+ hours.  For this I can thank the perfectly cast actors (check IMDB for details) portraying incredible characters that drip with humanity (Dr. Manhattan not withstanding).  The story serves well enough as a scaffold for these character to interact and react in.  I also have to give proper respect to Zack Snyder for actually not overdoing MOST of this film.  In fact, most of it was just plain stunning to look at.  I don't care if the book's author was cheesed off about this production.  I don't care if it was true to source material or not (as I haven't read it).  As a Superhero movie ""Watchmen"" just bumped down a bunch of other Super-movies on my list, including ""Dark Knight"".  Highly recommended for those seeking great, original characters presented in an entertaining way.

A big 4-4.5 star treat for the fans of the book and a confusing, fairly bizarre, yet visually striking (not thinking of the blue ---- but that too) original film for everyone else.

The overall look of this comic book movie is fantastic. There are brilliant moments that linger in your mind well after leaving the theater. The casting seems fine. I've not heard whatever complaints there were from the fanboys, if any. The screenplay is flawed. Though, I have no idea how it could have been better and still remained as dedicated to the source material. Couldn't things have moved along at a better pace (for non-fans too)? Well, for my part, well over an hour-maybe hour and a half- into this and it still felt like things were just starting. As for the plot, it's absurd. There are maybe one or two maybe three ""good guys"" but they can't make a difference, can they? And they all have problems. If you think something good or at least necessary was done at the end, you are morally lost my friend. I'm glad in our universe we don't have and do not need superheroes, especially ones like these. I hope.",1237852800,3,1117,4.502463054187192
3579286,4,B001FB55H6,"Just a brief review since I've just seen the film at the theater & it's still fresh in my head.

This was actually better than I thought it was gonna be. The basic spine of the story of the original comic book mini-series is strong enough to carry the movie along, especialy since Snyder & co. didn't jack w/ it too much.

The main reoccurring thought I had while watching the film was, ""Gee, I feel really bad for anyone who didn't read the original story before watching this, because they'll probably be incredibly confused."" Go ahead & see it w/o reading the graphic novel 1st. But don't say I didn't warn ya not to.",1237766400,5,620,4.3826086956521735
3579287,3,B001FB55H6,"First, I should start by announcing that I have never read the very popular graphic novel ""Watchmen', the source for the new film directed by Zach Snyder (""300""). I'm not sure that makes a difference, but I know there are a lot of ardent admirers out there and I hope these same admirers will read this review with an open mind. If not an open mind, at least with the ability to recognize the fact that others may not like the film as much as the diehard fans of the graphic novel probably do.

In the 1940s, the Minutemen form together to become a force of superheroes, prepared to help people in their time of need. Among this group are the Night Owl, Silk Specter (Carla Gugino), the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and Jon Osterman (Billy Crudup) who is involved in an accident at his lab and becomes Dr. Manhattan. The Minutemen are a ragtag group who wear hand-sewn costumes and basically fight villains with their bare hands. They are treated as heroes and this status seems to affect many of them in the wrong way. As time passes, some of these folks retire, others continue working for the government and some new folks join the group. Flash forward to ""Present Day"". It is 1985. Nixon is still in the White House and superheroes have been banned after one too many protests. So, the current Watchmen, Laurie Jupiter (Malin Akerman), Silk Spectre's daughter has taken over the reigns and now becomes Silk Spectre II, Night Owl II is now Dan Dreiberg (Patrick Wilson). Rohrshack (Jackie Earle Haley) and Ozymandias, who's alter ego Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode) is an industrialist, have gone, more or less, undercover. The US and Russia appear to be getting closer and closer to a nuclear war, promising certain annihilation. In fact, this possibility leads Dr. Manhattan to exile because his ability to see the future doesn't paint a good image for him. When the Comedian is murdered, the group reunites, in a fashion, and begins to investigate his murder, leading them to some surprising revelations.

""Watchmen"" as an idea is better than ""Watchmen"" as a film. From the moment I first saw trailers about this film, I was intrigued and gradually became more excited as the release date approached and I became aware of how many ardent fans there are of the graphic novel. Basically, a story about superheroes, these characters come from more real places, have more human emotions and problems, and get into more violent situations. In short, a more adult superhero experience. Great. Sign me up.

Zach Snyder, the 'visionary' (as the trailers and commercials for the film proclaim) director who created ""300"" is probably the right choice to bring this highly visual universe to reality. The Watchmen inhabit a sort of alternative universe. Nixon is still the President, enjoying his fifth term in office because he is so popular. We won the Vietnam War, thanks in large part to the members of the Watchmen (The Comedian and Dr. Manhattan are shown in combat). So things are different in this world. And everything appears real. Yet, it also has that comic book sort of appearance. Especially when some of the characters become their alter egos. Dan Dreiberg could be an extrapolation of Clark Kent. Snyder seems to have an innate sense of how to show us everything we need while filling in all of the extra space with unique and interesting details.

But Snyder doesn't seem to have as good a handle on both narrative and character development.

From what I understand, Snyder adheres pretty closely to the source material, so perhaps this is a criticism that should be addressed to Alan Moore and the other folks behind the graphic novel. But as director, Snyder is ultimately responsible for all elements of the finished film and can make (and should have made?) changes to the story to strengthen it. I suppose if he had changed the story too much, he would have heard about it from the legions of fans, so he's damned if he does and damned if he doesn't.

Yes, these characters are more human and more adult than many superheroes. And some of this works. For instance, a burgeoning relationship between Silk Spectre II and Night Owl II (Malin Ackerman and Patrick Wilson) leads to a believable place in this relationship, attributing some real moments to the film's R rating. But because they are also more human and more adult, they are not necessarily squeaky-clean characters. Or in some cases, even likable. Is it necessary to like a superhero? I kind of think it is. If you don't like a superhero, can you root for him to win a battle against the 'villain'? And in ""Watchmen"", it gets even more complicated than that. Is there a villain? A true villain who is working for a bad end? That is, at best, debatable.

Yes, Snyder seems to have fun creating certain environments for the characters. But he has already shown he can do this with the interesting and very visual ""300"", which was an unexpected and very good film. In ""Watchmen"" he creates dingy, grimy cities circa mid 40s and mid 80s. He also creates more than a few superhero-type fortresses and shows us the interior of a vehicle used by the new crew of the Watchmen. It is an interesting film visually. Because the film presents an alternate history of our country from a certain point, everything looks similar, but these similar items also look a little surreal. Grimy things are grimier, sexy people are sexier, beautiful things are more beautiful. This aspect of the film is accomplished in spades.

Snyder takes these moments of realism to an extreme. As the Watchmen battle various bad guys, using their fists and karate kicks, we see bones break and blood spurt. This is an interesting addition, and helps to make the story seem more adult. But Snyder also seems to linger more on the broken leg, for example. When the leg breaks, his camera slows down and lingers briefly on the broken limb, highlighting this moment of it. It is brief, but because he pauses and accentuates the action, it is all the more memorable. And maybe even disturbing.

""Visionary director Zach Snyder""? Something about the Warner Bros. publicity department labeling the director of their own film as ""visionary"" rubs me the wrong way. Snyder may very well be a great new talent, but visionary? This is a label that should be bestowed after years of great films. As a marketing tool it just seems desperate.

The actors are serviceable if unremarkable in their various roles. Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Jackie Earle Haley are certainly the best of the bunch, as they each play the most complicated characters. Morgan (TV's ""Grey's Anatomy"") plays the Comedian, a super hero who seems to enjoy many vices, smoking, booze, killing, and only occasionally tries to do the right thing. Having been around the longest, he also has the opportunity to become the most interesting. He has seen many things in his life as a superhero, both good and bad, and it isn't completely clear how these have affected him.

Jackie Earle Haley (""Little Children"", ""Breaking Away"") plays Rohrshack, a member of the Watchmen who has difficulty controlling his anger. When the Comedian is murdered, he leads the rest of the Watchmen in the investigation, propelling them into the rest of the story. He is also the most aggressive, hiding his real features behind a mask (that looks like the same thing Scarecrow wore in ""Batman Returns"") covered with ever changing ink blots, he attacks most people with the slightest provocation. And he doesn't stop until he makes sure the deed is done.

Patrick Wilson (""Little Children"") plays Dan Dreiberg whose alter ego Night Owl II seems to be the moral compass of the group. As Dreiberg, he looks like Clark Kent, complete with thick-rimmed glasses and nerdish looks. As Night Owl, we learn he inherited a lot of money allowing him to set up the headquarters for the Watchmen. There is a very good scene when he and Silk Spectre, as their alter egos, are confronted by a large group of hoodlums. Against seemingly invincible odds, they quickly dispatch the group.

Malin Ackerman plays Silk Spectre II and is the daughter of Silk Spectre (Carla Gugino), who now spends all her time in a booze-shrouded mist. Ackerman is certainly very pretty, but she is kind of boring as an actress. Every time she appears on screen, her facial expression seems to be the same. She is interested in both Dr. Manhattan and Night Owl and both are interested in her. She also uncovers a dark secret about her past and confronts her mother with the truth.

Billy Crudup, an actor I usually greatly admire and enjoy, plays Dr. Manhattan. Manhattan, a former scientist who gets caught in one of his experiments, gains a power allowing him to control all of the molecules in his body. This same experiment turns him blue. And seems to rob him of the need to wear clothes. It is more than a little disconcerting to see a computer-generated character designed to look like an outstanding body builder. And to see this man walking around naked, with his blue testicles hanging out for most of the film. I think the idea is that Dr. Manhattan's accident has caused him to reach a new level of power and enlightenment. He doesn't need to live on Earth. And doesn't appear to like to live on Earth. And wonders why he should try to save a planet he no longer has any ties to. During a conversation with Silk Spectre, he takes her to Mars so they can converse more freely. Of course, she has difficulty breathing and he quickly creates a safe building for her. But why go to Mars in the first place? There are a lot of questions left unanswered in ""Watchmen"".

And I don't get some of the alternative reality references. For instance, why is Nixon still in office in 1985? A co-worker tried to tell me that this made him more of a monarch than a President, and this is what gave him so much power. But these points of argument must come from the graphic novel, because they certainly aren't explored in the film. Nixon only makes a few appearances and no one really seems to be affected by him that much. And why have a monarch at all when it doesn't seem to really affect the story

""Watchmen"" is interesting visually, but the acting and narrative are a few KAPOWS short of a masterpiece. Quite a few ZOWIES.",1237766400,,10255,4.717476270240089
3579288,3,B001FB55H6,"In an alternate 1986, the US and Soviet Union are sliding towards war.  The Comedian (Morgan), a member of a disbanded group of superheroes called the Watchmen, is brutally murdered; setting events in motion that will change the world.  Rorschach (Haley), another member of the Watchmen, who happens to be a little unstable, sets out to find the killer.  He seeks the assistance of the rest of the team, Dr. Manhattan (Crudup), Silk Spectre (Ackerman), Ozymandias (Goode), and Night Owl (Wilson), to find the killer and is met with mixed reactions.

""Watchmen"" is based on the vastly popular graphic novel by Dave Gibbons and an uncredited Alan Moore.  I have not read the source material, but have heard that the movie is very faithful to the comic with the exception of the ending.  The story is dense and complex and is not always easy to follow.  I don't think that is intentional, and that works against the film.  For the most part, the characters do not stand out.  The exception is Rorschach, amazingly played by Jackie Earle Haley.  He chews the scenery and simply steals every single scene he is in.  I would have loved to see more of him, but this is an ensemble film, so he is only one of many.  The film looks great.  Director Zach Snyder has a clear grasp of how to make a good looking movie.  In the end, fans of the book will be mostly pleased I think, but those unfamiliar with the work might be a bit put off.

3579291,5,B001FB55H6,"After years of superhero/comic book/graphic novel adaptations that promised big things but fell just short of their marks (I'm looking your way, ""The Dark Knight""), Zack Snyder's awe-inspiring adaptation of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons's ""Watchmen"" has finally delivered the goods: a truly epic film version of a beloved comics institution that expands on the source material without compromising its vision.  While definitely not for the squeamish or short of attention span (or for the small child someone decided to bring to the theater where I saw it), ""Watchmen"" is still one of the few Hollywood products of the past few years that manage to be thoughtful and entertaining at the same time.  In a move that breaks with pretty much every other comic/graphic novel adaptation to come out this decade, ""Watchmen"" is set squarely in the real world, or at least in one possible version of it, and the actions of its protagonists don't take place in a fictional city or a vacuum but against a Cold War backdrop of paranoia, fear-mongering, and the looming threat of global annihilation.  The plot leaps back and forth and time and sprawls in all sorts of directions, with violent confrontations sharing space with quieter, more reflective moments, but Snyder manages to keep things moving inexorably forward and maintain tight control of a sizeable ensemble cast throughout.

For fans of the book, the setup of the movie should be instantly familiar: the year is 1985, Nixon is still president following the abolition of term limits, the U.S. and the Soviets are at the brink of mutually assured destruction in the face of a showdown over Afghanistan, and costumed heroes have been chased underground following a popular backlash and a governmental ban on their activities.  More important than the similarities in plot, though, is Snyder's shocking level of success in transplanting the world of the book onto the big screen.  While certain aspects of the story naturally had to be excised, the bleak, uncompromising worldview and moral complexity of Moore and Gibbons's book has made it to the screen almost fully intact.  Where Snyder's last directorial effort, ""300,"" was generally simplistic, humorless, and excessive, ""Watchmen"" by contrast is ambiguous, challenging, darkly comic, and never overreliant on its uniformly excellent special effects.  Some of the fight scenes are a little overly stylized and implausible (though again nowhere as annoyingly so as in ""300""), but given that they take up a few minutes of a film that runs over two and a half hours that's a minor concern at worst.  Besides, Snyder's gritty, grimy portrayal of New York City and the unflinching portrayals of brutality are more than enough to outweigh a little excessive stylization.  The use of music is great as well, with the intro set to Dylan's ""The Times They Are A-changing"" and the sex scene set to Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" being especially memorable.

For a movie accompanied by so much hype (and a clearly large budget), the cast is pretty short on big names, but the relative lack of star power turns out to be something of an advantage, with the sprawling ensemble fitting almost perfectly into their roles and the film's alternate reality without overpowering it.  The juiciest parts go to Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the smirking, misogynistic nihilist Edward ""The Comedian"" Blake and Jackie Earle Haley as the tormented vigilante Walter ""Rorschach"" Kovacs, and neither disappoints.  The Comedian is an especially ambiguous figure for this genre: he appears on the surface to be (and in many ways is) a bloodthirsty villain, but a closer examination reveals someone who sees past the veneer of civilization to grasp mankind's true (and ugly) nature, and can't think of any reaction beyond laughter.  As played by Morgan, The Comedian is an almost completely irredeemable character, but I still couldn't help finding him at least a little sympathetic.  In the equally pivotal role of Rorschach, Jackie Earle Haley is even more compelling, with the air of menace in his voice (and, later, his face) more than making up for his character's laconic nature.  Much as in the book, Rorschach is as much a force of nature as a character, equally as capable of monstrous violence as of heroism, and Haley's alternately muted and fearsome performance captures all of the inner turmoil and bizarre compulsions that drive him forward.  Malin Akerman seems to have been singled out for criticism in her role as the second Silk Spectre, which I don't find entirely fair--her work in some of the more dramatic scenes in the later going didn't make me forget Merryl Streep, but her character clearly wasn't intended to be the most heavyweight of the bunch, and she's at least adequate most of the time.  Besides, her near-total hotness and prominent presence in the aforementioned sex scene should more than mitigate any concerns about her acting chops.  The rest of the major players--Billy Crudup as the tenuously human genetic mutation Dr. Manhattan; Carla Gugino as the aging, jaded original Silk Spectre; Matthew Goode as the superhuman crime-fighter-turned-tycoon Ozymandias; Patrick Wilson as the nostalgic, relatively normal and well-adjusted Nite Owl--are all pretty competent, even if a few of them seem to have been picked at least in large part for their resemblance to the characters from the book.  And of course, Robert Wisden deserves special mention for his frighteningly believable performance as the neurotic, high-strung President Nixon.

Overall, in spite of a few minor flaws, Watchmen still easily manages to emerge as one of the top Hollywood movies released this decade.  While there were certainly a few concerns going in--its prodigious length, its daunting source material, the spotty record of recent superhero films--I for one was glued to the screen from minute one.  Having seen the movie, Moore's refusal to have his name associated with the project now seems more like pettiness than principle.

WHAT KIND OF PARENTS BRING THEIR KIDS TO AN R-RATED FILM!! Seriously, they have no one to blame but themselves.

I heard a lot of complaints about the sex and action scenes being too explicit.  But if you READ THE COMIC YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT TO EXPECT. This isn't your typical 'comic book movie' by any means. It isn't about superheroes coming together, being the good guys and saving the day. The whole point of the original series was to question what if these people existed in the REAL real world? Would they be upstanding citizens masquerading in cute little costumes, or would they be pseudo-sociopaths on the fringe of society?  This interpretation is that they are the latter. These people are ugly, amoral, messed up, self-centered, self-serving S.O.B's. The whole point of the story was to take the typical comic book hero and turn it on it's head. It's part murder mystery, part social commentary, part alternate history interpretation.
I could have done without the girl who played Silk Spectre II--pretty much eye candy and that was it. But the rest of the cast was perfect.
I especially loved Jackie Earle Haley's interpretation of Rorschach. He was Heath Ledger's Joker times ten. If there was ever an actor who deserved an Oscar nomination for a character, this was it. To be able to do what he did while wearing that mask almost the whole time was phenomenal. Unfortunately, this is not one of those films that you can just walk into blindly. You pretty much HAVE to read the comic if you want to know what is going on. That can be a good or bad thing, depending on what you expect. but this isn't a lighthearted popcorn flick. Those who went simply because of the hype should have done their homework before they saw it.
I for one absolutely loved it. I've seen it three times and will probably see it three more.",1237334400,9,2186,4.611825192802057
3579304,3,B001FB55H6,"This is something of a review for the non-initiates. Meaning those that aren't slavish ""Graphic Novel"" fanboys.

Then some of the plot points are not going to make much sense. But as a quick summary, it's an alternate history about the 80's Cold War (summed up nicely in the opening credits). Nixon used a super-powered being to end the Vietnam War and overturn the rules about term limits. But now the world teeters on the brink of a US/USSR Nuclear Exchange, and masked vigilantes that used to fight crime have been banned. And now, one of these ""Watchmen"" is suddenly, inexplicably murdered.

So now the Watchmen must risk breaking the law and exposing themselves to danger. Someone is trying to pick-off ex-heroes. Why...and is this connected to the buildup of international aggression? Can they stop the doomsday clock from the midnight of Nuclear Annihilation? The story is complex and often defies logic; no less a director than Terry Gilliam let the project slip from his hands as he described it as ""unfilmable."" Yet Zach Snyder (he of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300/dp/B000QXDED6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300</a>&nbsp;fame) working from a script by David Hayter have fashioned a near three hour film that dazzles the eye but lurches and jerks to its finale.

Snyder was a good pic for a few reasons; ""300"" was a visually stunning actioner that made up in scenery and motion what it lacked in coherence. However, 300 was a movie about heroes, ""Watchmen"" is one about anti-heroes. NiteOwl2 is more a Clark Kent than a superman, and Comedian is a nihlistic killer of women and children. SilkSpectre2 is the product of a rape. Rorschach is a paranoid sociopath who lost his conscience (and as played by Jackie Earle Haley, one of the things making ""Watchmen"" worth watching). Dr Manhattan (Billy Cruddup in motion capture gear), the one being among the Watchmen with any real superpower has power at the expense of his emotional clarity. There were a couple other fun casting decisions, like Matt Frewer (Max Headroom!) as Moloch.

All these things are direct from the adaptation of the script, and it is hard to call this an adaptation, it barely defers from the book only once in any major way and that is near the end. There's too much going on here plus a boatload of dead-weight. Rorschach's voice overs get to be overbearing; he's a character better suited to the juicy toss-off lines like his scene stealing ""I'm not locked up with you, you're all locked up in here with ME!"" The violence is usually gratuitous and the sex oft-times seems inserted just to prove ""Watchmen's"" 'edginess' when editorial coherence would have been better.

3579306,5,B001FB55H6,"'The Dark Knight' is a fantastic movie.

But if I had to go by how much a movie has affected me? 'Watchmen' wins hands down, for consider: never before has it occurred to me to go to the cinema twice to see the same movie. After seeing it on the Friday of its release, I needed to go back again that Sunday.

When I Read Clive Barker's 'Galilee' some years back I was stunned and amazed... and strangely gutted: I would never have the joy of reading that book again for the first time.

That's how I felt about 'Watchmen' when I first saw it.

It is not like any other superhero movie. Not like any other movie, period. I was amazed they got away with it. How did they get away with it?! For 20 years they tried to bring the original graphic novel source material to the big screen. After so many false starts (remember when Arnie - the now Governor of California - was going to be Dr. Manhattan?!) all anyone had a right to expect was a movie that had nothing much to do with the comic at all. That's why I'm stunned: It's so faithful I cannot help thinking, ""How did they get away with it?""

Even if you don't like the movie, you will still think to yourself, ""Well I definitely ain't never seen a movie like that before...""

For me 'Watchmen' is more layered than 'The Dark Knight', thus making repeated viewings so enriching.

Sure, 'The Dark Knight' is layered also, but its intentions are transparent, meaning you 'get it' the first time you see it. Its moody cinematography clearly marks it as a serious 'mature' movie.

'Watchmen' is far more subversive:

Here you have a movie which is bright and colourful and - gosh! - doesn't it look fun?! So why does it make some people uncomfortable? Because, on the surface, the movie taunts its audience by appearing to be yet another 'X-Men'.

The visual style of the movie may feel like a comic book, but the brutality of its violence honours the irony of The Comedian character's name: this is all a bad joke - me, you, this world's politicians, this petty thug whose face I'm smashing in, and yet ain't a one of us getting punished by the law for beating someone up cos we're wearing stupid costumes and that makes it all right.

Whereas every other Superhero Movie - including 'The Dark Knight' - celebrates the genre, 'Watchmen' gleefully deconstructs it. And it doesn't need shadow and smoke and dim lighting in order to do so.

On the surface everything is there for yet another formulaic Superhero Movie. After all, it looks the part...

... but this is where the genius of Watchmen's subversion comes in, for although the movie can be enjoyed on purely a visual visceral level, woven through its stock superhero tropes you have tales of rape, cancer and impotency -

- you even have one of the 'Good Guys' assassinating John F. Kennedy in the opening credits.

Compared to that 'The Dark Knight' seems positively pedestrian.

Even the movie's flaws (with the exception of President Nixon's large prosthetic nose) unintentionally work in its favour by holding up a spotlight to its own absurdity of grown men and women dressing up in Hallowe'en costumes.

One purpose of the movie's frequent slow-motion motif that I immediately noticed is that is gives the character Rorschach and Dr Manhattan's voice-overs room to breathe, whilst at the same time lending the movie its comic book look; and yet deliberately confounds your expectations by not being a comic superhero movie.

It's as if The Comedian (a thinly disguised 'Captain America') directed this movie -

A female protestor gets punched in the face without hesitation... by one of the 'Good Guys'. A pregnant woman gets shot at point-blank range... by one of the 'Good Guys'.

It you were to take The Dark Knight's premise of a 'gritty' superhero-movie-for-adults to its logical next level then 'Watchmen' would be the result. Be careful what you ask for because you just got it.

And you thought 'The Phantom Menace' 'raped your childhood'. You'll never look at 'Iron Man' and 'Spider-Man' the same way again.

The Nite Owl character (a thinly disguised 'Batman') is so hung up he becomes impotent the first time he's with Silk Spectre (a thinly disguised 'Wonder Woman'). And yet later - after cracking some heads - ? No problem. That's what makes the 'love scene' in the Nite Owl's airship so hilarious and appropriate: these people get off on beating up some poor schmucks in order that they can become 'whole' and connect. Even this is made blatant by the way the characters grin and mug at each other after fighting the Bad Guys: they're turned on by the violence they're dishing out and they're not ashamed to admit it. The song choice for that love scene?! ""Hallelujah"" right enough!! LOL!!! That's some serious screwed up Freudian stuff right there...

The Comedian is definitely behind the lens of this movie, chomping on his cigar.

Critics point to the lack of experience in the unknown actress who plays Silk Spectre. Yet, unintentionally, that works in the character's favour: she has an out-of-her-depth naivety, only 'coming alive' when fighting the 'Bad Guys'. Dr Manhattan (a thinly disguised 'Superman') shows the viewer logically what would happen if someone really was superhuman: a guy so powerful that his intelligence has caused him to lose his ability to relate to his fellow man.

""God help us all,"" right enough as The Comedian says upon noticing this.

And the coup de grace of unintentional flaws which work in the movie's favour? The Osymandias superhero character who ultimately 'saves the world' is flat, bland and totally uninteresting.

Just like they say: bad guys are so much more interesting to play. And this movie makes its 'Good Guys' so flawed that you can't tell them from the 'Bad Guys'.

As to the graphic violence -

As much as I love horror fiction I detest horror movies: they're nothing more than torture-porn.

At the same time, however, I believe the director Jack Snyder is deliberately shaming the audience into guilt because of its lust for violence. Watchmen's violence is not meant to be realistic - the slo-mo effect makes sure of that, whilst simultaneously glorying in it because, hey, that's what you want, right? The Good Guys and The Bad Guys duelling it out? Sure you do, that's what Superhero Movies are all about. You like to hear the crack of bones breaking? Okay. We'll show you it too. We'll show you it in such a way that you feel it, with slo-mo effect to rub your nose in it. After all, that's what you want.

But why do this?

A one point The Comedian character gets punched repeatedly in the face by a fellow 'Good Guy' superhero, until he falls to his knees.

With burst lip and bloody nose The Comedian looks up, grins, and says, ""This is what you like, huh? This is what gets you hot?""

The movie is taunting its audience, The Comedian looking into camera and speaking directly to them: you like punch-ups in Superhero Movies, don'tcha? So, we're giving it to ya, whatcha complaining about?

The violence is more graphic than it needs to be in order to make its audience uncomfortable, and thereby shame it.

Remember, 'Watchmen' is an anti-Superhero Movie.

'Watchmen' doesn't 'update' the Superhero Movie so much as crush it beneath its heel.

Unlike many reviewers of this film, I was not well-acquainted with the graphic novel on which this film was based before the motion picture adaptation came along.  I learned about the whole thing after seeing a preview for this film in 2008 and reading a bit about the story.  Thus, by the time I saw this in the theater, I was aware of the basic plot but not all that much more.  Despite a lot of mixed reviews, I decided to give this film a chance and was relatively pleasantly surprised.

Given that my expectations were fairly low (based on said film reviews), I have to say I enjoyed the film more than I expected I would. Specifically, I appreciated the somewhat more cerebral approach to a genre that often lacks in this area.  This film stood the entire superhero genre on its head, asking the viewer to consider what would happen if the archetypes were placed in somewhat more realistic situations and their belief systems or code of conduct were pushed to their logical extreme.  This alone is enough to merit 3.5 stars, and if it fails a bit by the end of the film it is still oftentimes convincing.  The characters were also very interesting and I enjoyed learning their individual backstories, which fleshed them out and made them seem like real people (even though one is blue and can do nearly anything imaginable due to a cliche freak-science-experiment-gone-wrong).  It was ultimately a very reflective film, and at moments very thought-provoking.  My favorite scene was the one in which Nite Owl II and Silk Spectre II decide to go out and be heroes again rather than remianing in retirement.  It's touching and shows how much the charaters' real identiies are wrapped up in or shaped by their assumed ones.  In other words, where does the individual end and the mask begin?  The film asked that question again and again, but didn't offer easy answers.

However, this film was by no means a five-star experience.  The gore (which many people mentioned to me before I saw the film) was jarring at times and actually served as un unappealing distraction from the story.  I understand the director's desire to be edgy in keeping with the nature of the graphic novel, but the director's decisions have to serve the overall message of the film and in my opinion this did not.  I also did not enjoy how the villain explains everything at the end, which is cliche to the point that it is just irritating.  However I can see why he did so, since the plot was at times convoluted.  It was also a very long film, which didn't give the characters all that much to do for stretches of time.

So overall worth a watch, but flawed enough not to merit 5 stars.",1237161600,14,2674,4.589473684210526

Ever since Zack Snyder announced that he was bringing Watchmen to the big screen, I had a great amount of reservations.  Not about the man himself, whose 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead I enjoyed, and whose adaptation of Frank Miller's 300 I thought was stunning, but because of the fact that this is Watchmen for crying out loud.  The most celebrated comic ever crafted was deemed unfilmable for so long, but finally here we are, and what is the verdict on Snyder's take of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' classic?  Mostly positive, but not without its flaws either.  From a visual standpoint, Snyder has nailed the environment of Watchmen, as well as the appearances of the characters that populate the film.  The biggest flaw of the film however lies in its conclusion.  Even though the end result of the comic remains unchanged, changing the cause to being blamed on Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) just doesn't sit right with me.  Maybe it's the fanboy in me, but with the appearance of Ozymandias' (Matthew Goode) genetically altered pet Bubastis, and with no mention of his work on genetics (which plays into his construction and development of the squid-like creature in the comic), doesn't this raise a few moments of confusion, especially for those who never read the comic?  Despite this, the rest of Watchmen has been translated greatly.  While there are some other questionable slight changes as the story develops, the film retains the paranoid and compelling tone of Moore's comic.  Not to mention the perfect casting of Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach, Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian, Crudup as Dr. Manhattan, and Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl; all of whom are superb.  Also, for a 160-some minute running time, it doesn't feel like it's that long, as you can't help but be glued to the screen from the brilliant title sequence onward.  All in all, Zack Snyder's take on Watchmen isn't without its flaws, but it is a visually stunning comic adaptation that manages to defy nearly everything that was going against it.  It isn't perfect, but it still manages to be something special as well, which is quite an achievement in itself.",1237075200,7,2237,4.837270341207349
3579309,5,B001FB55H6,"Set in a semi-fictional America - with all the familiar players - Zack Snyder's ""Watchmen"" is one of the most impressive movies I've seen so far this year. Snyder, cast and crew were dedicated to re-creating as truthfully as possible, the comic book elements fans of the series that its fans would demand. It paid off, but not without a few lulls. To his credit (and the horror of many) Snyder does not skimp one iota on the graphic violence, heightened sexuality and though deadly serious, liberally peppered with humor. The film opens with a brief scene of violence to set the time and planet jumping tale, followed by the most impressive opening credit sequence I've ever seen. In fact, the opening credits themselves - a recreation of many of the most iconic moments in 60's and 70's American history - are worth the ticket price. I found myself stirred emotionally, opening myself up for the insane, frightening world I was about to enter.

Most of the performance in Watchmen are adequate (Malin Akerman's Silk Spectre II) to top drawer (Billy Crudup's impressive Dr. Manhattan), with one particularly thrilling, pulse-pounding performance by Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach, arguably the heart and soul of the film. Haley's performance is so richly nuanced, starting at near fever pitch and growing in intensity from there. He is participant, narrator, catalyst for much of what happens through the film and clearly up to the challenge of a role that could easily have become . . . well, too cartoonish. He is, in a word: amazing.

Patrick Wilson is wonderful as the geekish, peaceable Dan/Night Owl, an endearing, soft-grained performance that tempers the often out-of-control violence in the world of Watchmen.

To Billy Crudup fell the unenviable task of making the elusive, cool-as-a-cucumber Dr. Manhattan a more likeable screen presence than he is required to be in the print-only version of the tale. He succeeds nicely, even stuck in the connundrum of wondering whether the human race is worth saving. It's a chilling proposition, particularly when we know/learn of Manhattan's previous human existence. The accident that created him is one of several moments in the film where Snyder expands the tension of the moment to let our emotions swell, this one (and the final scene) allowing for lump-in-the-throat heartbreak. Just as he is in the comics, Dr. Manhattan is naked through most of the film and eventually one gets used to the fact that almost every time we see him we're going to see his flacid blue penis. The CGI-transformed Crudup is brilliantly calm as he rationalizes his action (and non-action) to the point of frustration to all around him (especially Richard M. Nixon).

There will be plenty of naysayers, and fans who feel short-shrifted there favorite moments were not included, but such is the nature of filmmaking. Watchmen stayed with me through the night, and has, so far, dominated my thoughts today and I want to see it again soon.

A total pleasure for all of the senses. Yes, I know there is always the nitpicking by those who truly do not understand the genius of the interpretation, and all I can say is, take in the whole process, rather than question the parts, and you will walk away satisfied.",1236988800,6,736,4.419117647058823
3579311,4,B001FB55H6,"""The Watchmen"" is an in-your-face, anarchic, riotous, almost diabolic film based on the much loved Alan Moore graphic novel. Much has been made of whether this story could or should be filmed, but give Zach Snyder, the cast, and a great script credit because they pulled off an amazing coup. In an era of huge box-office receipts for superheroes movies, this movies takes a big bite out of the hand that is well feeding Hollywood. The heroes found in the Watchmen are not only human (with one noticeable exception), but are psychotic, neurotic, unnecessarily violent, pretentious, self-absorbed, and downright evil.

The death of the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), one of a former superhero group called the Watchmen, spurs Rorschach, another former member (played by Jackie Earle Haley and easily the best performance in the film) to investigate, and he starts on a trail that quickly ensnares the other former Watchmen - Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman), Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), and the most powerful of all, Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), a hyper-sentient being who control matter as a result of a horrible lab accident.

The time is an alternate universe in the year 1985, where the US won the war in Vietnam, Richard Nixon is still president, and superheroes have been outlawed. This and the peverse way the film turns the superhero convention on its head lays the groundwork for a movie whose worldview is sometimes as paranoid, if not more so, than Rorschach, whose suspicious nature and malevolence seems symbolic for the world he fights so hard to protect. As is the Comedian, seen in flashbacks as anything but heroic, and who seems to stand for something perceived as heroic, when in fact, heroism is an excuse to perpetrate violence.

This film, regardless of comparisons to Alan Moore's work, stands alone as a great film. Gory, gritty, uncompromising, yet strangely hopeful, The Watchmen is a great film for those who want their superheroes dark and dank.",1236988800,9,2002,5.042296072507553
3579312,1,B001FB55H6,"I'll try to be as kind as I can to this travesty but I just felt so apalled.

Why?

Alright, well first I'd better confess that I've never read the Watchmen comic books.  Seocond I saw the movie not aware that the story was about 'anti-heroes'.

If I could sum up Watchmen in a single word it would be ""Nihilistic"".

So we enter a story were all the characters are a bunch of washed up retired super heroes (the idea in itself is stupid.  If you have super abilities for life, your always going to have them, sure you could give it a rest but honestly, if anyway saw someone as awesome as 'Dr Manhattan', I don't think the world would just go on as normal and humanity just fights and kills itself.  The whole idea that turning this amazing individual into the source of hate and in the process saving humanity was simply ludicrous.  Further more, anyone that could become like that would surely have more depth than to roll around in there own self pity and then let something as fundamental as a relationship turn to slime.  COME ON!!!! ).

It's set in the 1980s (which is a great feature but once again a depiction of American 1980s(plus yes the alternate President Nixon version noted and also not agreed with) not the world(they even used a German 1980s song in the film, ironic).

The only moments of joy in the whole film was the 2 characters comming back to fly the super hero ship and do a bit of work and the scene with that mask character(yes the characters were so forgettable I've already forgotten there names), declaring in the prison: ""You don't understand! I'm not in here with  you!,  Your in here with me!!"".

My main dissapointment was 'Dr Manhattan"".  COME ON!!! A super hero so insanely awesome, he could simply have stopped all wars by vaporising all the weapons only.  He could have taken every nuke on the face of the earth, turned them into there seperated molecular components and sent them into the sun.  Or even better recycled them into useful peices of equipment.  Instead what does the character I was so drawn to get portrayed as?  A puppet for the government who goes into battles taking out waves of soldiers by destroying in a single thought and then winds up creating a fusion reactor or mass energy source without even knowing what the real intentions of the device will be????
UTTERLY REDICULOUS.  Sorry, this guy is a scientist, I think he would have a few more brain cells in there to consider the possibilities.  They whole 'I can see into everything and it all just becomes the same, a life is no different from my self constructed glass structure on Mars were I will sit and pontificate for the rest of my days because I couldn't find any miracles!!!""  WHAT THE @%^????  So with all he can do, he's no miracle?????????

Then there it is, the main point that totally blew, it's basically a simple fact that these writers only believe that all of humanity is a lost cause and that it takes mass devastation to herald peace.  What utter trash.  The end seemed to flow as if through there self sacrifce peace was achieved but at the cost of thousands of lives.  Well there self sacrifice if you could call it that was no different to a world war and we all know we never want to see those again besides the skirmish wars which sadly occur each and everyday, humanity is thankfully at the very least a global economy showing there is hope that we can all work together.

Perhaps I took this movie too seriously but for me, a super hero movie has always been about showing moral's, hope and presenting messages of importance to people.(Not just that humanity is a slime that is the cause of all misery, the cause of all misery is when individuals choose to look at the world in a certain way.  What I can not fathom is why all the marketing guff?  THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN'S MOVIE (Although if any child saw it, I'd imagine they may fall asleep like my girlfriend did through the entire movie).  Why are there 'action figures', colouring books, big coloured mass produced badges, T-shirts etc?  This movie and it's associated graphic novel are known for being an adult comic and movie, it shouldn't be promoted even jokingly as if it were a family film.

Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, you should both be ashamed that you have wasted your lives bringing this miserable tale into existance and the only reason I'm wasting time writing this review is that so many people have hailed it as a masterpeice I wanted to take the time to speak up and break the unwarranted hype. (I did like Dr Manhattan but only what he could do, the character himself was utterly paper thin, but I guess as you wrote the story for comic books that was the point).

  Watchmen is an entertaining adaptation of it's source material, but there are a few problems. Instead of nit-picking about the minor flaws I would like to address one fundamental flaw. The film fails to adequately express the subversive riptide that underscores the original comics narrative. The subversion is, that either/or, left/right, us/them, reptile brain linear thinking is an apocalyptic dead end. even Adrian Viedt the ""smartest man in the world"" succumbs to this fallacy and creates another false dichotomy. It's a brilliant piece of dramatic irony to have the one character that is the most slavishly devoted to this narrow minded linear thinking Rorschach expose Adrian's latest iteration.",1236816000,,715,5.4818181818181815

I did not read Watchmen the graphic novel, so I really didn't know what I was in for.  But that's part of the fun sometimes.  Unfortunately I cannot say this movie was a pleasant surprise.  The trailer showed me it had potential, which is really all I had to go on.  Call me crazy, but I prefer the traditional superhero movie without the gore and the sex and the bright blue penis.  But on the plus side, the special effects were nice, the fight choreography was pretty good, and some parts were really neat, like Dr. Manhattan on Mars.  He was a cool character.  I especially liked how he could dismantle and suspend things in midair, make clones of himself, teleport, and grow to a ginormous size.  Nevertheless, this is not a movie for children.  Get them a babysitter if you want to see this film.  Should you see this film in the theater, or buy it on DVD?  Tough call.  If you liked the darkness of the last 2 Batman films (with Christian Bale), you are in the ballpark of the dark vibe of Watchmen, but Watchmen has more sex and gore.

I would wait for the obligatory ""extended"" cut, but it is your money.  It has its pleasures, such as the (violent) story of one of the vigilant heroes (Rorschach) and some slick visuals.  The rest is a tired saga of puppets saying supposedly profound stuff, ala ""Dark Knight"".  The good thing is that, unless we get ""Maus"" on screen, Hollywood must now get their ideas from other sources other than comics (and I am relieved by that).
Note: I did not read the comic.  As with any medium, comics can also contain masterpieces that can shape our understanding of ourselves and be tools for a better future. I simply do not trust the way by which Hollywood can handle the best works of this genre, being this film a proof.",1236729600,4,847,4.503267973856209
3579338,5,B001FB55H6,"I honestly never heard of the graphic novel until quite recently, within the last 8 months actually. I stopped reading comic books when I was around 11 simply because it was becoming too expensive a hobby for a child of my age and my favirote series(X-men and Spiderman) were starting to diverge and convalute in such ways that I was no longer interested in them. I love ""comic book films,"" however, but my favirotes are those that appear more relevant and ""real,"" in a sense, such as Batman Begins and The Dark Knight(Iron Man is one of the best examples as well).

Having said all that, I bought the graphic novel a few months ago and read it within 4 days and saw every piece of what fans have come to love about it almost immediatelly. It is an honest attempt at making a comic book less ""comic"" and more realistic. It is as much a social commentary on the American society as it was through the 60's, 70's, and 80's as any larger political piece that tries to be. It is briliiant in it's texture that thickens the character of every hero, villian, and regular joe that has a small part in the grand scheme of the play. The use of metaphor in things like the ""Black Freighter"" comic add more complexity to an already enormous amount in the reimagined history of post-Vietnam American culture. Going into this film not knowing what the graphic novel was can severly hamper your ability to enjoy it.

I went with my wife and she has literally no interest in comic books or the films they spawn(but she does eventually come to love ones of quality, such as those I mention here), she had no understanding of what this was going to be beyond my brief description, but she is still talking about this film with me after having seen it over 4 days ago. People tend to get turned off when they see things like the fruity costumes or a ""big blue guy"" in previews, but I tried my best to explain that you simply cannot judge this example by its cover. It has somethign for everyone.

For faithful lovers of the best selling graphic novel, it is extremelly faithful in almost every regard, except perhaps the key part: the ending. That is not to say that they messed it up, they did not at all, they just changed a few key aspects to be more, I suppose, respresentative of something that could really happen. The few parts that are not extrapolated such as the origin of Veldt's tiger pal(or it's importance or why it even exists), the subplots based around the various ""pedestrian"" characters who make up the overlying theme are never really explained or expanded(in most cases, such as in that of the psychaitrist, they are only there for a couple of scenes and their real purpose is not the same as it was in the novel), but the general effect of the ending is still there. They made as few changes as possible, but its literally impossible to make a movie that exactly follows the graphic novel without it being over 4 hours long. It is a long movie even at just over 2 hours and 40 minutes, but it never really feels like it. It was a fast moving picture.

There is a fair amount of action, but it does not take the foreground, but what is there is very well done if not obscenelly graphic. The sex and violence in the film is certainly true, almost perfectly so, to the graphic novel, so this is not a film for children under 14-15, if even that young. The music is vry fitting and goes back to the era that the novel refers to. You will hear many classic tunes from the 60's and 70's that simply run perfect as a counter to the action happening in most scenes. The actor's also all do a very good job at the portrayal of their characters, specifically those who took on the role of Silk Specter, Night Owl II, and definatelly Rorschach. Just as in the book, good'ol ink-face is the most interesting and fun of the bunch and you definatelly get the same feeling watching him in action as you did reading about him. He seems to almost jump off the page.

This review has already gone on longer than I had hoped, but you can't put into words the way film comes across. If you are a person who can genuinelly observe a film as what it is, what it means to be, and what it is trying to do, then you will love it. If you go in expecting to see Spiderman 4 or think this film is somehow a perfect reproduction of what the Vietnam war/Cold War-era United States was, then you will likewise be disappointed. This film is a good representation of graphic art in its highest form, and I for one hope that more ""comic book"" films continue down this path, rather than popularize and glorify what it means to be a ""hero"".",1236729600,12,4608,4.365967365967366

Without such context, much less the fan-boy enthusiasm, this 2009 comic-book extravaganza is hamstrung by the limitations of conventional filmmaking despite a marathon 155-minute running time. The story is quite dense and multi-layered at first exposure, and while the alternate universe presented has strong entertainment value, there is less of a case for the frequent use of gratuitous violence to punctuate the nihilism of the story. Director Zack Snyder is an inspired choice to lead the character-driven mayhem given the visual invention he brought to the Battle of Thermopylae in 2007's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300/dp/B000QXDED6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300</a>. His sharp eye for detail is evident throughout this elaborate production, but the movie has problems with pacing and more critically, a palpable absence of soul that would have made it more directly comparable to Christopher Nolan's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight/dp/B001GZ6QC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight</a>.

Set in an alternate-reality 1985 with Richard Nixon in his fifth term, the story has the Cold War moving into high gear with the Soviets willing to test our country's resolve with the potential of a nuclear strike. The opening credits effectively trace the semi-familiar history that brings the plot to this point with golden-era, costumed crime-fighters giving way to the next generation of superheroes in the 1970's. Snyder goes as far as recreating the Zapruder video of the Kennedy assassination with the smoking gun held by the morally bankrupt Comedian, one of the Watchmen who moved from WWII-era pop icon to reviled vigilante three decades later. Looking like the dark side of DC Comics' Justice League of America, the Watchmen had long disbanded by the time the Comedian is murdered in his apartment. This sparks at least some of the confederation to reunite albeit with trepidation. They turn out to be a motley group of psychological misfits beginning with Laurie Jupiter, a.k.a. Silk Spectre II, hesitant about wearing her latex suit again to fight for justice like her now-alcoholic mother, and Nite Owl, a fallen man reduced to impotence by retirement.

More interesting are Dr. Manhattan, blue-skinned and nude with the power of a god thanks to a Hulk-like paranormal lab accident; and Ozymandias, now known as Adrian Viedt, the world's smartest man and a billionaire captain of industry. However, the most intriguing Watchman is the appropriately named Rorschach, who wears a face mask with constantly shifting ink blots. A true loner in the tradition of Travis Bickle in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taxi-Driver/dp/B000R8YC18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taxi Driver</a>, he expresses a visceral loathing for mankind's dissoluteness that manifests itself into the film's goriest scenes. All the characters feel disconnected from humanity, and their warped perspectives drive the story. While Snyder pulls few punches in his depiction of them, the primary problem with the film is that he can't seem to pull it all together to make a dark-hearted adventure that can soar. Except for a clever use of Bob Dylan's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Times-They-Are-A-Changin/dp/B0009MAP9A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Times They Are A-Changin'</a>&nbsp;over the opening credits, Snyder's use of period music simply feels intrusive and out-of-sync without adding any texture to the film.

Much of the comic-book-level dialogue also feels stilted, and unfortunately, few in the cast seem to know how to deliver it with conviction. The best of the bunch are Billy Crudup as the eerily becalming Dr. Manhattan and Jackie Earle Haley constantly seething with Eastwood-level rage as Rorschach. Jeffrey Dean Morgan registers with conviction in just a few scenes as the Comedian. However, their contributions are offset by the miscalculated performances of a too-bland Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl, Matthew Goode looking overly metrosexual as Ozymandia, and Malin Ackerman who plays Laurie in a petulant manner that trivializes her character's ambivalence about being a superhero. Granted there are good set-pieces like the bravura fight scene right at the beginning. Unfortunately, saddled with some surprisingly substandard CGI, the final scenes wring dramatically flat given the build-up to them, and they dampen my appetite for a sequel with the survivors. Even with all its flaws, the film boasts a visual audacity that is hard to pass up, especially if your appetite has been whetted by the novel. Clearly, Snyder has put greater priority in maintaining fidelity to the source material rather than making a movie that could resonate for the rest of us.",1236643200,2,5211,6.067842605156038
3579340,5,B001FB55H6,"Since its initial printing in 1984, Watchmen has basically been the standard by which all comics to follow would be judged. its top notch story telling, and character developement are fully evident in the theatrical vision of this story.

Zach Snyder was the best director Watchmen could've had, his style perfectly fits this gritty, harrowing tale, not to mention the highly stylized action in the vein of 300 with all the bone crunching hits in tact.

if you are clueless as to the story, there are plenty of long reviews on here that go over all that, so ill spare the little details. i just want to say, its one of the best comic adaptations ive ever seen, if not THE best. this movie delivers on every front, action, story, visuals, character developement. it was had to beleve they could condense a full years comic run into one movie, but they did it perfectly, i hate to say it, as much as i absolutely love the books little complexities, but the pacing was probably better than the original story, along with the ending.

all older/mature fans of masked vigilante films need to see this, and to all fans of the original work - this is a faithful rendition of one of the best stories ever told in comics. it couldn't get any better, unless there is an unrated directors cut upon dvd/blu-ray release.

3579342,5,B001FB55H6,"PURE BRILLIANCE!!  And dare I say it??  BETTER than the book!
Oh geez, I can already sense the comic book purists ready to crucify me.  Relax dudes, stop hyperventilating, wipe the fog from your glasses.  This is just my opinion, and I can say with no hesitation--this film is top-notch, quite possibly even better than the graphic novel!  I think they are both remarkable achievements, of course, but the movie does surpass the book in one major area.  More on that later.

Okay, I'm aware of Mr. Moore taking his name off the credits.  That move really makes no sense to me.  Mainly because I am fairly certain he received a fat paycheck for the rights to this story.  If he felt so strongly against any deviation to his artistic vision, he should have stood adamant with his original writing.

Now, I am usually the first to diss Hollywood.  I still loathe the changes they made to the great comic book series WANTED.  But some alterations can be good, remember the novel adaptation of THE SHINING?  Some people will criticize something just because it strays from the version they were expecting.

And for those who say this movie doesn't capture the emotional capacity of the book--I say BULLOCKS!!!  This movie is packed with excellent depictions of fear, anger, confusion, regret, lust, sadness, apathy, humor, anxiety, sarcasm, pain....seriously, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more thorough psychological examination at the theater.  This is humanity exposed, inside and out.

I imagine the harshest criticism for this film is due to the ending.  Zack Snyder does stay EXTREMELY close to the book until the climax.  I am totally surprised to say that I loved it!  It was a small alteration, but made a big difference.  The change was just plain brilliant, plus it made perfect sense with this story.  Really, think about it--would the director make such a drastic change to the end of the most celebrated graphic novel of all time if he wasn't positive of the results?  I think not.

WATCHMEN is easily the best film so far this year.  Along with THE DARK KNIGHT and IRON MAN, it's amazing to see the genre rise above the label of popcorn entertainment.  This most likely won't appeal to the masses.  Kudos to the cast and crew for their stellar efforts.",1236643200,5,2264,4.765463917525773

Upon reading Alan Moore's Watchmen I was blown away by its complexity and attention to various small details that could be present in a society where caped crusaders were a part of everyday life, and the loved the philosophy presented within the panels, but now I am forced into the difficult task of judging this movie adaptation of the infamous graphic novel.  Upon seeing this movie I wrote an initial review of my opinion, but realized there was something wrong with it.  The problem was that I was spending more time praising Moore's novel than the actual movie, so I deleted it and decided to start from scratch after spending a good deal of time reflecting on the movie and flipping through the panels of the comic.

Now I am torn between liking and disliking this film adaptation of the beloved graphic novel.

On one hand I love Moore's original story and comic.  On the other hand I am not very fond of director Zack Snyder's previous films (the remake of Dawn of the Dead and 300).

On one hand this movie mimics the visual style of the novel very well and looks very well polished.  On the other hand Snyder and his team in their dedication to perfectly mimicking the story of the graphic novel have made this final product come across as very mechanical and unmoving.

For the most part the actors pull of their parts, but none of them really go above and beyond to truly make the characters anything more than iconic images lovingly ripped from the panels of Moore's story.  There were only two actors who I felt really tried to do something with their characters in an attempt to enhance the characters, and they were Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach and Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian.  Aside from these two performances I feel that most of the actors were so determined to fit Snyder's idea of matching the book perfectly that they failed to take the initiative to really try and break the wall and make this movie more than the graphic novel put into motion.  But, not to leave him out of this review Billy Crudup did do a satisfactory performance behind the make-up and special effects for his portrayal of Doctor Manhattan, but it wasn't good enough to really get my attention when compared to Earle Haley and Dean Morgan.

We also get decent performances by a few minor, supporting cast members, such as Robert Wisden as Richard Nixon.  He wasn't no Frank Langella and his make-up was rather off part of Snyder once again trying to carbon copy the graphic novel), but it was by no means a bad Nixon performance.  A good supporting act is also given by Carla Gugino as the first Silk Spectre.

Even with the few acting problems the production is a good and it is strong.  The images are dazzling, and very true to the comic.  It is definitely one of best providers of eye candy we're likely to see 2009, but then we have to remember visuals aren't everything, and that's why I was let down by this film.

My biggest problem, as I have previously mentioned, is the lack of initiative that the production crew took when making this film.  It's like they took up a diet of respectively redoing the comic for twelve weeks until they remembered each panel perfectly and made the actors do the same.  Most of the actors don't look like they're really into their roles, and the production is just a fanboy dream come true, but it manages to do one thing that made me mad that keeps me from rating this higher than a seven.

If this had just been a visual comic down to the letter I would probably give it an 8/10, but the few times Snyder decides to take action and add in his own little ideas to the plot it just really distracted me from the concept of the story, and ruined the mood for me.  What is it that Snyder is adding that angers me so much?  Perhaps the most pointless gore and drawn out sex scenes I have ever seen on the big screen.

The gore is tacky, and cheap, and distracts from the story, and philosophy behind the images.  Many of these images were not in the graphic novel, and nor were they ever even HINTED in the graphic novel.  In this movie we have arms broken wide open, a man has his arms cut off, and a man repeatedly has his head cut into by a meat cleaver.  None of these moments ever took place in the graphic novel, and I felt they threw off the pace, and distracted the viewers from what was actually going on, and I won't even talk about how he drew out a sex scene that was like six-panels into a 5-10 minute scene.

My favorite part was by far the opening credits, and I don't say that in a bad way because it was really a brilliant way to open the movie.  To the tune of `The Times They Are A Changin' we get an animated series of photos that maps out most of the Watchmen's history, the universe they live in, and the setting for the rest of the film.  This moment alone makes this movie a must-see for fans of the comics.

I can't recommend this film very positively because I for one was disappointed by the finished product.  I'm sure many will rave about this film, and it's sure to become a cult-classic, but compared to the graphic novel it really is nothing.  Watchmen may be the most endearing comic of all time, and is a classic for the medium, but as a film its impact will not be as lasting as films such as last year's The Dark Knight.  The comic will always be remembered as a great, and an incredibly unique, original tale, but I fear this film adaptation will slip away into strictly cult-movie realm over the next twenty years.",1236556800,5,5510,4.395073891625616
3579344,4,B001FB55H6,"Wow. What an amazing movie. Watchmen is based on the serial comic of the same name. The story was perfectly and faithfully transferred into film. The film even feels like a comic book and I can remember each picture in the book.

What if superheroes and masked vigilantes were involved in the World's most crucial events (Vietnam war, the Cold War, etc.)? The story follows a group of heroes as they try to discover who murdered one of them, The Comedian, and why. It has been prohibited for heroes to use their powers and with the threat of an oncoming nuclear war, they have to make a decision and try to prevent it (circa US 1985).

The art direction, special effects were amazing. The fight scenes were graphic and amazingly filmed. Although it is long (2 h 45 mins), I hardly felt it as I was too engrossed in the movie.

Billy Crudup gives his character, Dr. Manhattan, the perfect detached  personality that questions whether he has any remaining human proclivities. He was amazing in his performance and so were the other actors. The movie centers around the idea of humanity, hope and the loss of both. The heroes face the decision as to what has to be sacrificed to save the spiraling human race from itself.

- Billy Crudup deserves an Oscar for Best Actor in a Nude Role

- you get to see superheroes making love

- the music blows your mind: Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah, 99 Red Balloons (in German)

- there are more ideas in the first five minutes than in the whole of most Hollywood releases

Set in a dark alternate 1985 with nuclear armageddon a very real possibility, this story is at its heart a murder mystery, but along the way, provides though-provoking insight on the effect of the actions of the characters in the movie.

What would it be like to be so powerful that you were not human anymore?  How can you retain that aspect of yourself?  What good is it to fight the small criminals if society as a whole slides into the abyss?  In a world dominated by shades of gray, can the black and white concepts of good and evil hold their meaning?  What if an act of good ultimately does far more harm than good?  Or the reverse?

While the movie does not spend as long wrestling with the deepest parts of the graphic novel, it does a fine job of planting them in the brains of the viewers.

As with the director's ""300,"" this is not a children's comic book film.  This is a dark, violent, confusing world.  Never more so that with the character Rorshach, who steals the movie.

So many complained about the length of the movie, sex and violence, awful ending. I found none of it. The movie was almost 3 hours long but I never got bored even for a moment. I liked the pacing of the story, flashbacks and flashforwards. It was almost like reading a book and I love reading. Sex and violence? Come on, it was rated R. What did people expect? Ending was also great for me, true to the story and thought-provoking.

3579348,5,B001FB55H6,"*SPOILER WARNING*

Let me be blunt.

Alan Moore should eat crow and be proud of this movie. ""Unfilmable"" it most certainly wasn't.

And the fanboys all need to take a laxative. This was in at least some ways better than the maxi-series/graphic novel, which will never be demoted from its status as a classic of its medium.

Aside from the overly graphic violence, a gratuituous sex scene, and Dr. Manhattan's needless nudity (he needed to wear pants, and seeing his genitalia added nothing to the plot)I really have nothing negative to say about Watchmen.

Let's diffuse some of the criticisms I've come across.

Yes, Matthew Goode was foppish as Ozymandias. He's supposed to be that way. He's not intended to exude menace. That's his style. A villian as sublime as Ozymandias is subtle. Coming across as overtly malevolent would have caused his plans to fail. His slender, Aryan appearance and slight German accent made him the perfect choice to play the type of foe who believes that the murder of millions is the only way to save the world.

Which brings me to the casting. There was not one actor who didn't fit their respective character like Rorschach's inkblot mask. The decisions made concerning who should play who were more accurate than any comic book movie I can think of.

Jeffrey Dean Morgan's Comedian was Burt Reynolds as a misogynist sociopath. It was as if the character himself was directly lifted from the pages of the graphic novel and given life. It was uncanny how Morgan captured this character's all too easy violence, his nonchalant, happy penchant for brutality.

I said in a review of Batman:The Dark Knight that Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker was unfathomably good, especially considering Ledger's teen idol pedigree.

Jackie Earle Haley's Rorschach dethrones Ledger's Joker in that regard. From out of some forgotten void, a former heart throb returns to play a madman akin to Robert DeNiro's Travis Bickle or Michael Douglas' William Foster. My money would be on Haley's Rorschach as Steve Ditko's right-wing Objectivist Mr. A, the analogue for Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' character, is channeled with such a chilling and disturbed beauty. His guilt is blended with an intolerance as he claims that the dead heroine Silhouette met her fate due to being a lesbian. When Haley takes off the mask, things become even more unnverving as you see how ""fascinatingly ugly"" Walter Kovacs, Rorschach's alter ego is, inside and out. Again, having a former Tiger Beat hero play such a character was just remarkable to me. 20 years from now, people will never believe that Haley was once a Bad News Bear, and for that alone he deserves an Oscar. Seriously. His performance is more than enough to recommend this film to anyone.

None of the other performances disappoint. Patrick Wilson's Nite Owl also deserves mention as he nails down the David Brinkley (from Robert Mayer's obscure but very influential 1977 novel 'Superfolks') as Batman that Moore and Gibbons intended Nite Owl to be. He's awkward, stuffy, insecure, and rusty in crimefighting and life in general, and Wilson flawlessly gets that across.

As an aside, and us comics fans need to face this fact, the film versions of Silk Spectre, Nite Owl, and Ozymandias absolutely trump the comics versions in terms of design. Silk Spectre is sexier, Nite Owl is fierce, sleek, and punches his wonky-looking comics counterpart back to DC's Silver Age, and here Ozymandias is a Greek god compared to Gibbons' take.

Some people are complaining that Malin Akerman's Silk Spectre was dry, but I thought she was fine. In fact, she was just the right mixture of innocent and sultry and thusly kept with the spirit of not only Silk Spectre herself but also of the characters that inspired Moore and Gibbons to create her. Akerman was one mod version of Phantom Lady or Nightshade.

Remember, they're all analogues because if they weren't, we wouldn't have had any Blue Beetle or Question tales in the 80's.

Carla Gugino is quite the aging diva here. Her makeup job as a senior (The Silk Spectre's mother and predecessor) is so astonishing you'd think she was an unknown. In the flashback sequences she is the epitome of retro eroticism.

She sees herself in an underground porn comic and is flattered. Wow.

And speaking of unknowns, can anyone honestly think of any famous actors who would have done as well or better in these roles? Yet another reason why Watchmen is such a success. John Cusack as Nite Owl? Please.

So the casting was faithful as was the entire movie for the most part, thereby squashing another gripe the fans had. I'll even go as far as to say that Watchmen works so well because it is very faithful to its source material.

Yes, the ending is somewhat different, yet is pretty much the same. Ozymandias stages nuclear attacks instead of an alien invasion to unite mankind, ""killing millions to save billions"" as he himself would put it.

You know, when I read the Watchmen chapter in David Hughes' book ""The Greatest Sci-Fi Movies Never Made,"" and saw that Sam Hamm didn't feel that the ending of the original comics story ""worked"" for him, I knew then and there that the makers of Watchmen the film weren't going to completely stick to Moore and Gibbons' vision. And that slight difference (it's just a parallel path to the same destination) only made for a better movie.

Alien invasions are not timely in any period, let alone this alternate Nixon-led 1985 or 2009. The threat of mutually assured nuclear holocaust is. If humanity is to be dealt a serious blow, it will be by humanity's own hand, not something from beyond our solar system.

What we have with the cinematic Watchmen, is what I believe we had with the original tale. It's a treatise on those who rule the world, masked as a superhero yarn, which in turn is masked as a murder mystery. It makes you think, and at the same time is mindful of that needed sense of wonder. It's scary, nihilistic, exciting, provocative, and its ending is as hopeful as it is troubling.

The tale of the Watchmen is like a railroad track that is built with the best of aims yet leads to nowhere but perdition. What will our elites do, or what are they above or not above doing to improve the human condition? Who in power can we trust? In the movie, we see Nixon, Kissinger, and other real-life malefactors who did what they did for personal gain. What of Ozymandias? What did he stand to gain? Did he really love humankind or have nothing but detached contempt for it? We see this with Billy Crudup's Dr. Manhattan as well, although Manhattan suffers from disappointment and heartbroken selfishness, whereas Ozymandias has this sense of birthright to save the world from itself by way of genocide.

I may need to dig out my copy of Watchmen the graphic novel as it has admittedly been a few years since I last perused it, but as a comics fan of 30 years, as someone who holds comics in the highest regard as an artform and recognizes the Moore/Gibbons masterwork as deserving of its status, I will state that Watchmen was more than worth the wait. One could even make a case that it's a better movie because it took so long to happen, that development hell aided in making it what it is.

And it bears repeating, Watchmen, with some minor and essential tweaking, is reverent of the comic book, and that reverence is another component that makes the movie so engrossing.

There was a time when I didn't think that a Watchmen film should be made. However, upon seeing the final product, I am left with some questions.

Why isn't Alan Moore rejoicing?

And why isn't comics fandom rejoicing along with him?

Even if you've never read a comic book in your life, I strongly recommend Watchmen. If it doesn't make you a fan of the comic book or of comics in general, then you didn't enjoy the film, and if you didn't enjoy the film, I have nothing left to say to you. If you think that your unfamiliarity with the characters, the fact that they aren't icons like Batman and Spider-Man, will hinder your enjoyment, remind yourself of the Hellboy phenomenon. Hellboy was a mid-level character that has never had an ongoing series and was published by a company that was not Marvel or DC. He has since been the subject of a pair of moviehouse blockbusters. Also be mindful of the the popular Men In Black franchise and its origin as an obscure independent comic book. From the looks of it, the heroes/villians (are they one and the same?) of Watchmen are about to join that club.

If you are a comics fan and haven't seen it yet, leave the nitpicker in you at home, allow yourself to be surprised in the best way possible, and go ahead and be a little smug as the closing credits roll. You deserve it for being so far ahead of the curve.

A monument of comics finally has a cinematic counterpart. Hold your head high.",1236556800,746,8857,4.705882352941177
3579349,1,B001FB55H6,"In Watchmen there are very few good guys! The violence is so gruesome at times I had to repeatedly cover my eyes! And I'm in my 40's! I WANT TO WARN PARENTS THIS FILM IS NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG TEENS! While the Watchmen is a fantasy/science fiction/drama/chick flick -it's also a horror film! This is NOT some cute Super Hero story!

This story was written back in the 1980's when the Cold War was still unfolding. Those who are too young to remember the fear of nuclear war and that the Commies would someday be knocking on our doors -are lucky! It's sad to say, but ALL wars from the Korean to Vietnam, and every other war Americans funded throughout the world - in mostly poor, Third World nations - were all caused by the never ending Cold War! Keep in mind these numerous wars cost millions of lives and many billions of dollars! Watchmen, while a fantasy, is certainly realistic when it comes to the fear many people around the world felt. (And, this is an era which should be carefully studied by every student in the United States before graduating high school, but I digress....)

Watchmen is an important film, which will soon be forgotten because of the extreme violence and, at the same time, for it's profound political message. This is also an anti-Republican and anti-conservative film - as blatantly political as you can get! This is the part of the story I love! While Richard Nixon and the toady Henry Kissinger were no dummies by any stretch of the imagination, they both were accurately portrayed as morally bankrupt and plain crazy! But the bottom line here is that the majority of voting Americans vote these monsters into office and then collectively shrug their shoulders when rotten things happen! To say that the Watchmen is a sobering story about the sheer stupidity of the human race in general - and the American people, specifically, is an understatement!

3579350,3,B001FB55H6,"If you've read the Watchmen comic - you'll appreciate the movie. I use the word ""appreciate"" and not ""like"" or ""love"" because the comic novel is too complex to turn into a movie.

If you have no idea about the comic novel, the movie will come across as an unnecessarily long, sort-of-violent, movie that is hard to follow and which people who are easily disturbed will find terrible. The movie comes across like someone read the novel, created a bunch of scenes for the movie and then put them together as best as one could.

This movie with a thought provoking climax at the very end, will not give you a happy movie experience like say 'Iron Man'.

I recommend this movie to anyone who likes dark sci-fi, alternate themes in movies and those looking specifically for something non-mainstream.

If you have read the comic novel and liked it - do watch the movie. Otherwise wait for the DVD. The movie has some cool special effects but overall not great story telling or direction. The entertainment level in this movie is sort of choppy. Therefore I rate it as a 3 stars.",1236470400,2,1072,4.567708333333333

The political tension can be cut with a knife; Russia and the USA are on the verge of a nuclear holocaust. Masked heroes (or vigilantes if you prefer), the Watchmen, have been banned awhile back through the Keane Act. Rorschach never gave up his mask even after the Keane Act was passed. He searches for who killed the Comedian and wonders if they are trying to kill off the rest of the Watchmen. The rest are the Silk Spectre (okay it needs to be said, but her hair is awesome), the ever-so smart Adrian Vedt, and ""closest thing you can get to Clark Kent"" Nite Owl. The only Watchman with ""super"" powers is Dr. Manhattan (physicist; his powers came to be after an accident). Does Dr. Manhattan care enough about humanity to save it from itself? Is there anyone else who could? The characters in the graphic novel are NOT knights in shining armor. Some have dirty pasts, some do dirty things. For example, the Comedian tried to rape one of his cohorts. Its so hard to praise this film because its such a close copy of the graphic novel. I don't want to knock Alan Moore by saying Zack Snyder did a wonderful job. But I'm not going to hate the movie so I can stay 'faithful' to the graphic novel's writer, y'know. So, are you going to like this movie? The acting is good, the visuals are stunning, and the special effects and fighting scenes are great. Some people will automatically never give this movie a fair shot because of what it is an imitation of something near perfect and some people are going to walk into this expecting a Superman story and just won't ""get it"".

It's also adapted from an arguably brilliant written piece of fiction, so the dialog in the movie will surely be interpreted as verbose or pretentious by the unfamiliar, unsuspecting audience member.

For hardcore fans, the ending has a significant change, but to some degree you can see it as an improvement from the original work. I think the filmmakers did an excellent job on this adaptation, though I think the average audience member who is unaware of the story may be alienated.

3579364,4,B001FB55H6,"Premise
*It is an alternate 1985.  Richard Nixon remains president for several consecutive terms; America won the Vietnam war; the tensions between America and the USSR almost causes a full outbreak of thermonuclear war.  In the midst of all this, a group of masked heroes (who have been disbanded previously) investigates the murder of one of their own men.  One thing leads to another, building up to a climax that could bring about the end of humanity.

The Good Things
*Video/sound quality was excellent in the theater, and should prove to be awesome when they put this on disc.
*The film has a fair amount of action and lots of interesting special effects, yet none of them ever really push the film over the edge like other superhero movies.  In fact, this film downplays much of the action to tell the story.
*The visual style is impressive.  There are some slow-motion effects, but not as many as I thought there would be.  Aside from the vivid special effects (which provides lots of memorable images), the photography is great.
*Production design is good; costumes and props are good, and the sets are great.  Look out for some motifs and some historical references.
*The story is very interesting.  It is very different from the usual comic-book films, and presents a lot of themes and ideas to really think about (for example, ideas about the savagery of human nature, and the state of society).
*The characters are excellent; a lot of time is spent on developing them, and by the end of the film, you can really understand them.  They are well-acted and well-written.
*Music is interesting.

The Bad Things
*As noted above, the action is downplayed.  The first hour or so of the movie is spent developing the characters and showing the world that they live in.  Some people may be dissapointed if they were expecting more action, especially for a movie that runs over two and a half hours long.
*Not for kids; rated R for quite a few scenes with gnarly bloody violence, some sex scenes, nudity (including full male nudity...with the blue guy nonetheless), brutality, and thematic elements.

The Questionable Things
*The morality of this whole story is pretty messed up.  The ""heroes"" do a lot of wicked things, while the ""villian"" is righteous.  There is a deeper philosophical meaning to all this, and the story brings up some interesting ideas and questions.  But while much of it is thought-provoking and unique, some people may find it frustrating or just plain weird.

In the movie, Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) described the miracle of life as a paradox, relating to ""turning air into gold,"" and that might as well be the paradigm of this whole movie.  It is a paradox, not only because this film was said to be ""unfilmable,"" but because here we have a comic-boook hero movie without any real heroes; instead, the characters are morally ambiguous and live in a world that is close to annihilation.  Yet, despite all of the condemning views of humanity, the movie ends with hope.  These are just some of the thoughts that this movie throws out at you; it is a very thought-provoking story with some insightful characters.  At the same time, the movie has some awe-inspiring imagery, a few good action scenes, and a surprising amount of blood, guts, cursing, and sex.  This is definitely not the usual comic-book adaptation, but whether you love it or hate it, it may just stick with you and leave you thinking.",1236470400,4,3428,4.792517006802721
3579365,4,B001FB55H6,"This movie offers plenty to like and a little to dislike. On the liking side, it does a great job of adapting Moore's complex story to the big screen. Of course, a few things had to be sacrificed, but what came though seems true to the 1980s original. As a comics movie, you might expect a major effects-fest, and the CGI crew delivers brilliantly. Most of all, Moore's original vision of switchback plot twists and moral ambiguity comes through as jarringly as it did when the original mini-series came out, back in the 1980s.

That's also what some viewers will dislike. The movie addresses complex issues that we still face, including war, crime against women, and deciding whether ends justify means. Like the real world, this doesn't supply easy answers. The viewer isn't supposed to come away certain that justice has been served or that the good guys won. That's where I find another incongruity. The story addresses deep issues, but does so with shallow characters.

There's a lot more to say about Watchmen's place in graphic novel history, but this isn't the place for that discussion. It's a good story, but it aged. This movie brings that story to life beautifully, but carries those signs of age with it. Go ahead, enjoy this one (at least, the parts you're supposed to enjoy), but don't expect it to change the universe of comic book movies.

3579366,5,B001FB55H6,"Were there no comic of Watchmen in existence and this film had just appeared as is in it's current form it would  be hailed as a masterpiece. Sure this is just pure speculation on my part but my point is that the only way one can be critical of this film is to nit pick it against it's source material tit for tat. To go to the theater and sit and see it anew as a film while trying to ""forget"" the comic will bring about a wholly enjoyable moviegoing experience. Of course one can not forget the comic if you have read it. It's something many of us have read, absorbed and assimilated.

As far as the comic goes I can not stand the coloring and to a lesser degree, the art. I do not care if you disagree with me on this point of if the art and it's coloring were also meant to be as they were to harken back to the comics the book itself was paralleling in it's alternate version of comic reality. As an artist myself I enjoyed art before words. I still buy my current comics and graphic novels first and foremost for the art. As a writer I understand the value of a good story but with graphic novels there needs to be a complete balance. The dated coloring and small paneled Watchmen comic do not and never did have the impact on me that this new film has. I always loved the comic and still have my original but my tastes have matured and the film has now become the new version of this story for me. I re-read it before seeing the film and found the film more powerful and visceral that the book ever was. When making a film of a book you had better have something to add to make the film more than the sum-total of the book. God does this film deliver.

I go to movies because I enjoy them. I tend to go to films I am pretty sure I am going to like. I stay away from stuff I am sure to hate. Also, and this is important, I do not go to the movies to walk out and say what garbage something was. Sure I see garbage just like everyone else does, and sure it's subjective what one person likes and another hates. To want to go to see this film, watch it, come out and say it's utter garbage, well, there is no talking to you. If you enjoy the comic and hate this I am not sure what you wanted, or how you would have done it better. Every (important) scene from the book was there, acted well, shot well, uncluttered by Tom Cruise stars, and presented coherently telling the tale. And anyone arguing that it was too close is off base too.  Much was reinterpreted with contemporary values, contemporary cinema, and current and also timeless issues all in mind. Action scenes were not shot panel for panel but fleshed out in a way that made sense.

This film was also made by someone who cares about such adaptations like no one else never has. Care and reverence has been given to this and 300 like no other comic to screen films ever have. Many people, throngs of people (mostly pro journalists) who never read the original when they were kids have skillfully grabbed a copy, quickly sifted through the WATCHMEN book they would have, or never desired to read on their own and have now written reviews as if they are experts on both the book and it's now younger son-- the film. You need to want to read the book and want to see and enjoy this film to be qualified to review it. Some stuffy journalist who hates all comic films and bows to Batman Begins and The Dark Night as some masterpiece simply because they were told it is one and also because Heath Ledger died are not the people I want to read reviews from.

And if you never read the book and you tend not to like comic films, please, stay home. Save your pennies for what you like. This film is not for you.

For any who are missing the cut parts, the missing comic, and more: DO NOT DESPAIR! These missing parts will be added. We live in a world where money, yes money, is the driving force behind many decisions. A 4 hour epic that could only play 3 or 4 times in a day is just not economically feasible. Zack Snyder has got your back, cares as you do and will be editing in missing scenes, and the comic, for a summer release and of course a DVD/ BLURAY release down the road. To all those that say a film does not read like a book and you can not skip around, wait for the DVD/BLURAY. Then you can skip to your hears content, pause, and hey... even rewind, just like a book. If you think all writing should no be done on the screen well steer clear of just about all movies out there.

Now if after all this, you see the film and find it utter drivel garbage but still love the book, well there is no talking to you.  I can only wonder what floats your boat and what you would have made if given the chance. zack snyder sits alongside peter Jackson as someone who fully immerses himself into the art he is creating. This film has a soul that breathes loudly and will have a very long life. It will also help to change cinema, comics, and bring old stories that sit abandoned as screenplays, short stories, and comics to life on the big screen, if for only the simple reason because the studios see that this worked and other stories like and as brainy as it can work too.

One final point I'd like to make is that if Alan Moore hates all graphic novel to cinema interpretations and will not even let his name go on his baby, how has this guy let each and every work he has created slip from his fingers and become films? Makes little sense. J. D. Sallinger and Bill Watterson sit at home quietly with their creations safely their own and have never relinquished control. There is no film of The Catcher in the Rye. There are no Calvin and Hobbes toys or animated shows. Moore, if he wants his babies to stay pure, should stop giving up control and then complaining like he had no choice.",1236470400,14,5752,4.178539224526601

3579368,4,B001FB55H6,"I had a blast watching it. And now, the complaints.

Some of the scenes lacked the impact of the graphic novel, strangely enough. The chief standout was the bar scene where Blake gets cut. The damage to his face has been greatly minimized, as though it were a mere scratch, and his words to Jon are devoid of emotional impact. This is the case for many scenes, where it seems the actors are rushing through their lines - a beat or two is sadly missing. This is evident, for example, when Daniel says, ""What do you expect? The comedian is dead"" (perhaps I paraphrase).

There are some inspired shots, such as when we see Blake's tear navigating the rivulets of his face.

The great Plot has been slightly changed, but to no great detriment. There are perhaps a few more left-wing jabs, but the thoughtful viewer will see that the entire constitutes a right-wing cautionary tale about ""smarter"" men making decisions for ""the little people,"" and how far they are willing to go - to sacrifice (others) - to create a Utopia. There are also jabs at our coddling of evil. So there's plenty to be enjoyed (and frowned at) by viewers of almost all political leanings.

The action that has been added all works for the good of the movie, although some of the violence is gratuitiously graphic, albeit in keeping with the graphic novel.

All in all, an entertaining translation to screen. The sad thing is that many viewers will not ask the big question - is that the only way to bring about peace in a world of fallen beings? To create false crises, such as global cooling (in the 70's), then warming (80's to 90's? I dunno), then, when the earth started cooling in 2001 (search on ""Climategate""), ""climate change"" instead? Perhaps this will be a wake-up call to search for the true meaning of man - the call to be something grander and nobler than the butt of a practical joke, rooted in the realization that our deepest longings are not just chemical illusions borne of atomic accidents, but are for something true and worthwhile that can only be found in Someone greater than ourselves.",1236384000,2,2079,4.608108108108108
3579369,4,B001FB55H6,"For the uninitiated:
This film based on the acclaimed comic book by Alan Moore & Dave Gibbons is set in a world slightly skewed from our own. What if superheroes had existed since the early 20th century? How would they skew our own history--Vietnam for instance? The bulk of ""Watchmen"" is set in the 1980s when the USA & Russia are on the brink of nuclear war. Superheroes were outlawed during President Nixon's 3rd term in office and now someone is killing off the retired heroes. The film uses flashbacks to give history on each of the Watchmen as the world ticks ever closer to nuclear annihilation.

Purists will likely have complaints about deviations from the source material, but they should be few as ""Watchmen"" has to be one of the most faithful adaptations of a comic book ever realized on screen. ""Watchmen"" is a well paced, violent, adult (male and female nudity is prominent), comic book film that uses extraordinary characters and situations to explore some of the most basic aspects of humanity.

For the fans who've read the comic:
[Spoilers Below!!!]

Some minor drawbacks to the film include the make-up. The younger characters made to look older were terrible! Ditto for Nixon and all the other ""real"" characters like Ted Koppel and such. The make-up was so disturbingly unrealistic that it really killed the moment whenever they were on screen--Nixon especially. People in the theater actually laughed when he came on screen to announce DEFCON One!

I also thought the role of Ozymandias really needed a bigger name star--or at least an actor who could command more of a presence on screen. Way back when Snyder took over as director Tom Cruise's name was thrown around for the role and I think he would've been perfect for the part.

However, my biggest problem with the film is the same problem I had with the comic book--the ending. The only way to avert global nuclear annihilation is through some random culling? We simply know that's not true now. I don't know, maybe it's because I nuclear war was never a real fear for me growing up. Maybe that's why I could not relate to the weight of this seemingly impending doom on the characters in the story; even with devices like the ""Doomsday Clock"" and newspaper headlines to try and convey this real fear of the story's characters it never connected w/ me as an audience member/reader.

Dr. Manhattan's floppy blue wang gets WAY more screen time than necessary. Ditto for the number of shots of man-butt. And I saw it in IMAX so whenever I held up my hand to obscure Dr. M's junk it did no good.

Gratuitous male nudity aside, the movie rocked! I'm not a big fan of the comic. I read it back around 2001 and liked it enough, but I don't hold it with the reverence hardcore fans do. However, after watching the film I do want to go back and read the comic again. I'll likely do this before I buy it on DVD--and this movie is begging for the 3-disc in-depth DVD treatment.

The flashbacks and the reveal of each character's back story were handled beautifully. I agree w/ everyone else in that Silk Spectre II & Nite Owl II came off as the most sympathetic. But Rorschach was the real star of the film for me. His journal entries narrate the film as it did the comic, and he remains the only un-compromised character--the only one solely dedicated to justice. The Comedian & Rorschach had the meatiest roles and both actors did an outstanding job in the roles. ""Watchmen"" will not disappoint!",1236384000,3,3468,4.6292682926829265
3579370,4,B001FB55H6,"It's five minutes until midnight on the Doomsday Clock. The Cold War between the US and Russia shows no sign of thawing. Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) can no longer see the future and he believes the reason is nuclear holocaust.

One of the last masked superheroes takes a fall from his highrise apartment to the ground below. The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) was a precarious mixture of good and evil and someone finally took him out while he was watching television.

The US government led by 5 term president, Richard M. Nixon (Robert Wisden) has outlawed masked heroes. Only Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) is still on the streets trying to fight crime.  He's trying desperately to find the man who killed the Comedian, but none of his old co-horts seems to care.

This is just the setup for ""The Watchmen"" Spring 2009's predicted blockbuster.  The film, which runs at an impressive 163 minutes, is based on Alan Moore's acclaimed graphic novel.  The director, Zack Snyder, used a great deal of Dave Gibbons's original art as a storyboard for the film and it really does show.

Two of the most compelling actors in this story are Haley as the crusading Rorschach, who still believes in the superheroes and helping his own, and the Morgan, who plays an intense Comedian whose actions make one wonder why even Rorschach wouldn't be better off just walking away.

The CGI for this film is spectacular, but be warned, the action is quite real and not for the squeamish or very young. Violence against women and children is particularly rough, but faithful to what I remember from the originals.  I admit, seeing real actors conveying the story is quite a bit different than looking at one dimensional drawings and for me, the film had much more impact.

The music is some of the most evocative of the 60's, 70's and 80's, including ""Hallelujah"" by Leonard Cohen and ""Sounds of Silence"" by Simon and Garfunkel.

I can't speak to the faithfulness to the original work. I read the story back when they were still comics and CGI wasn't even a gleam in a geek's eye.  And yet, so many of the characters and thoughts from this novel have haunted me for years.

I will probably see the film again and will definitely purchase the soundtrack.  ""Watchmen"" is well worth 3 hours of your time and if you're like me, you will be thinking of the film for some time to come.

3579371,3,B001FB55H6,"The biggest challenge for directors and screenplay writers --  who are forced to deal with significant source material -- is to make a movie that'll appeal to a broad audience while not alienating those fans who love what the film's based on; in this case, The Watchmen graphic novels/comics created by Alan Moore. Released via DC Comics in 1986 and 1987, the twelve book limited series quickly developed a cult following thanks to the truly graphic nature in which superheroes were depicted. Artist Dave Gibson and colorist John Higgins gave readers gritty images that swerved far beyond the comfort zone of most graphic novel fans, giving us heroes with flaws so grand it would make Penthouse and Pl@yboy Magazine editors blush.

The film rights for WATCHMEN were snapped up in 1986 and several production companies, directors, screenplay artists and others attempted adaptations that were promptly shelved. Directors such as Terry Gilliam (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tideland/dp/B000KB4898/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tideland</a>), David Hayter (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Men/dp/B000AYELVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Men</a>) and Darren Aronofsky (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wrestler/dp/B001TOD9VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wrestler</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fountain/dp/B000O7667K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fountain</a>) were at different times slated to take on the film, but eventually backed out. Aronofsky I think was an interesting choice, specifically because I so enjoyed his visual take on The Fountain. But Gilliam deserves quite a bit of credit for saying something that rings truer than most. He said, ""I'd direct the Watchmen if it could be made into a five hour miniseries."" Hmm. Considering the extensive source material, that probably wouldn't be a bad idea. And considering the length of this suck@r (163 minutes with an extended version that adds another twenty), one can't help but wonder what Gilliam would've done with it. But, instead, we got Zach Snyder (300) and a theatrical release this year (2009).

Not taking anything away from Snyder, he did pretty well with what he got, which was an overstuffed script filled with some sketchy dialogue. But he also had some great visuals and an amazing musical score that really rocked the film on many different levels. The music came from so many sources that it boggles my mind. Nat King Cole. Bob Dylan. Simon & Garfunkel. Jimi Hendrix. And even KC and the Sunshine Band. All of the songs were well incorporated into the story and gave an added flavor to the scenes.

One also MUST take note of the film's well-deserved R rating. The F-word is liberally sprinkled throughout, as is the act itself. One particularly steamy scene inside an aircraft reveals every inch of two prime characters, and I do mean EVERY INCH. Violence is rampant, just as it should've been, but parents might think -- this being a based on a ""comic book"" -- that it is relatively harmless, Spiderman-like action. Not so. Dismemberment. Superheroes shooting -- and killing -- pregnant women. Rape. All of these are predominantly in the film's forefront, showing us the deconstruction of the superhero mythos envisioned by the graphic novels' original artist, Alan Moore.

While the films visual qualities, sound, and music are something for fans to cheer about, the terrible dialogue, rearend-numbing length, and confusing narration sequences pull the movie down quite a few notches. Initially seeming to be Rorschach's responsibility to narrate what's come before and after (Rorschach is a cop with a face only a psychologist could love and played very well by Jackie Earle Haley,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Children/dp/B000N3SU92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Children</a>), the narration then jumps to Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Good-Shepherd/dp/B000MXPE7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Good Shepherd</a>) -- whom I've affectionately renamed Mr. Peni$ -- and back, and then back again to Rorschach. Since we're basically viewing the film via Rorschach's journal, I think sticking with him would've been the best and least confusing way to go.

An example of the film's bad dialogue are just too easy to find: ""I know who my father was,"" and ""It doesn't take a genius to see the world has problems,"" and the lowly ""Never compromise. Not even in the face of Armageddon.""

Even with these significant flaws, it's worth praising Zach Snyder for having the teste$ to move forward and make this film. That, in itself, is nothing short of miraculous. But it doesn't negate the obstacles that could've made this a truly great film. Perhaps a trilogy would've been better?",1236384000,5,4967,6.007062146892656

It just wasn't good, but how could it be? Time magazine listed the graphic novel as one of the 100 best novels of the last century and I agree. But Alan Moore (a compelling cat, allegedly worships Glycon, a Roman snake deity, practices magic, worth looking him up) stated he wanted to utilize the potential comics have over other mediums, that Watchmen was ""unfilmable."" He was right.

I almost walked out of the movie when Jimmie Hendrix started playing on Mars. Lame. The whole soundtrack was an abomination (Simon and Garfunkel? Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah during a love scene?). Epic failure.

But the worst part is the film lacks subtlety. Snyder, who filmed a virtual shot-by-shot remake of 300, does the much of the same here. But it doesn't work. He takes little risks (the ""changed ending"" isn't that much of a departure and cheapens the message).

You're going to watch it anyway, but I strongly suggest lowering your expectations. Alan Moore was right, and Hollywood is still a compromising courtesan.",1236384000,4,1024,4.936046511627907
3579373,5,B001FB55H6,"Watchmen has always been called the un-adaptable graphic novel. Luckily, Zack Snyder has proven this theory wrong, and with great success.

As you can tell by my 5 star rating, I find Watchmen as a massive entertainment spectacle that shouldn't be missed. To fans of the graphic novel, such as myself, it's faithful more than enough while also giving you a separate experience from reading the novel. To those who barely know what Watchmen is, this will give you a breathtaking experience, a challenge to all you think about the superhero movie. If you thought The Dark Knight was this(which it greatly did), then prepare for Watchmen.

The direction on this film is fantastic. After seeing 300, I thought it was an okay movie with not much depth to it at all, just good ol' fun blood and tarnage. I never thought of Zack Snyder as a visionary, but with Watchmen, I now see that he's up to something this time. I really can't imagine another director doing this film; there's never a false note in his direction(except perhaps a lengthy sex scene, which we'll discuss later). Unlike 300, alot of the violence is rapid fire, along with the slow motion stuff (which doesn't happen THAT often, much to my delight, as I thought that's all the violence would be). Sitting in the director's chair is someone who's a rabid fan of the novel and someone who can handle all of the goings on of directing a film of this calibur, and come out of it making the audience understand the depth of everything, that is, if they have a brain.

This film isn't without its flaws. I was overall disappointed with Billy Crudup's performance as Dr. Manhattan. Dr. Manhattan was depressed in the novel, but he wasn't a wuss, which is the unfortunate vibe I got from him in this film. Malin Akermman's performance as the Silk Spectre II wasn't very good either, but that didn't mean as much to me as Dr. Manhattan (and, this might be too shallow, but she very much captured the look of the Silk Spectre). Speaking of which, there is a sex scene between her and the Nite Owl that goes a wee bit too far; some of it was very beautiful, but some of it felt too much like porn. And it didn't help that they used Leonard Cohen's version of Hallelujah; I'd prefer they've used Jeff Buckley's or perhaps that version from Shrek (I can't remember who did that).

Flaws aside, this is a film that can't be missed. But keep in mind, it is NOT for younger people; there are some very brutal fight scenes, and the prison sequence is by far one of the most violent parts of the movie, let alone one of the most violent parts of a movie I recall in recent history. To put in simply, the film earns it's R rating, and then some. (but then again, if it were dumbed down to a PG-13, we'd have a much less powerful film)",1236384000,2,2777,4.460629921259843

3579385,4,B001FB55H6,"Comic book adaptations are all the rage these days and they are a dime-a-dozen. To prepare for this review, I re-read the graphic novel so I can give a more detailed viewpoint. ""Watchmen"" is adapted from the award-winning 12-issue mini-series in the 80's which in turn became a popular graphic novel. The graphic novel was written by Alan Moore (From Hell, V for Vendetta) and illustrated by Dave Gibbons (Green Lantern) and adapted to the big screen by Zack Snyder (300). This is Snyder's third full-length feature film, and he is in familiar ground in taking well-received formulas in pop culture, make it a strong visual affair and he calls the film a ""tribute"" or a homage. Most of the time, Alan Moore is displeased with the final result when his story is adapted; as far as I can recall, only twice has he requested his name removed from a film's credits because of his strong displeasure--it was with the Wachowski's ""V for Vendetta"" and you guessed it...in ""Watchmen"". This is why you only see ""based on the graphic novel illustrated by Dave Gibbons"" in the credits. Moore's name appears in the credits of ""League of the Extraordinary Gentlemen"" and ""From Hell"". (whether it was because of the insistence of the producers or he gave his blessing for these other films, I do not know)

The government has banned ""super-hero"" operations with a law passed in the senate and most heroes have retired. When a former super-hero called ""The Comedian"" (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is murdered, a still operating vigilante called Rorshach/Walter Kovacs (Jackie Earle Harley) takes it upon himself to investigate and comes to the conclusion that someone is killing ""masked"" vigilantes. He takes it upon himself to warn his fellow super heroes such as the Nite Owl/Dan Drieberg (Stephen McHattie), Silk Spectre/Laurie Juspeczyk (Malin Akerman), Dr. Manhattan/Jon Osterman (Billy Crudup) and a genius industrialist Ozymandias/Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode) of the supposed conspiracy. Aided by his former partner, the Nite Owl and Silk Spectre 2, what they find is just something so unbelievably insane that it will shake the very world.

I wasn't kidding when I said that Snyder makes these ""tribute"" films. ""Watchmen"" is so full of iconic sequences that is lifted from the graphic novel; the scene in the prison mess hall, Dr. Manhattan`s citadel, all would give fans a reason to rejoice. The dialogue is almost derived word for word, Snyder succeeds where he has excelled in ""300"", the viewer does feel like he is reading a live action comic book. The characters in the film have plenty of development in the form of flashbacks, fans of the graphic novel will be thrilled. The film is pretty much lifted from the novel with some minor additions--the film is more action-packed than the graphic novel (brutal, fast and hard-hitting), some sequences are extended and some are deleted. The film has its share of sex scenes and nudity and you see Dr. Manhattan the way he was in the comic--stark naked most of the time. The film does emulate a certain darkly foreboding mood, but it also doesn't lose it's sense of black humor. The screenplay by David Hayter and Alex Tse is meant to give us a sense of nostalgia, and they do succeed, well, at least until the final act of the film...

Purists of Alan Moore's storyline will be a little disappointed as certain key elements in the graphic novel are missing. Laurie is a smoker (which is why she turned on the flamethrower and caused the accident) and abhors donning her costume, the original Nite Owl wasn't killed by gang members in the film, the boy in the news stand does make an appearance but the key subplot on what he was reading is missing. That subplot, ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" was extremely important in the graphic novel's commentary on humanity's sense of survival. The conversation in Mars between Laurie and Dr. Manhattan is significantly short, and loses a lot of its dramatic and emotional edge. Yes, Snyder and company does make an impressive visual and aural feast, but they missed the original story's dark message and philosophical relevance.

I am also assuming that Alan Moore had his name removed because the climax takes a significant nose dive and I am sure purists will be very upset. The climax in the film lacked a strong effect on its narrative as it deviated from the original material. This ending may be easier to connect with for those unfamiliar with the graphic novel, but honestly, it felt very clichd, unimaginative and predictable. The approach in the graphic novel was very methodical, moody and full of emotions which is why it became a so-called holy ground for comic fans. This film is just another Hollywood fare that uses the source material as a template and not as its stimulation and inspiration.

The direction by Zack Snyder is competent but it does have a lot of problems. Sure, it is difficult to compress 12 issues into one film--but one can stay faithful to the feel, essence and thought of the original. He uses the recognizable scenes and famous illustrations as camera shots to tickle fans of the graphic novel. The film has an overabundance in slow motion, and while I thought this was meant to emulate the feel a comic reading experience, Snyder could have done well in refraining a bit from the slo-mo. The direction does present quite a number of plot holes, and felt uneven at times. The biggest goof of them all occurs in the final act of the film when Dan Drieberg said that ""everything will be ok, as long as people believe Jon is watching over them (or was it ""watching them?).."" which is PURE contradiction to what happened before and to the book's essence. I cannot disclose any more without further spoiling the film, you will have to see for yourself but how can fear be the one factor to inspire peace? Wasn't the ""Watchmen"" supposed to help people live without fear? The direction is definitely a mere ""copy"" of the sequences from the novel, and Snyder made no effort to make the ""Watchmen"" mythos his own and insists that audiences should fill in the plot gaps themselves.

The performances are decently acted for the most part and I thought Jackie Earle Harley stole the show as Rorshach. I loved the scenes when he was in prison. The character is by far the most interesting character of them all. Walter Kovacs would give the most ruthless movie serial killers pause. Malin Akerman is charming as Silk Spectre 2 and luscious Carla Gugino even makes an appearance as her mother. I found Stephen McHattie's ""Nite Owl"" quite amusing but found Matthew Goode's ""Ozymandias"", interesting but a little underwhelming--his plan made him unworthy of being the ""smartest guy in the world"". The CGI rendered ""Dr, Manhattan"" looks very good and maintains a creepy nature to his character.

The visuals are very well done and the CGI rendered environment is quite cool to look at. The costumes have been improved to give the film a more ""real"" feel, Dr. Manhattan and Rorshach are the only two characters who had their appearances unaltered from the comic. The special effects does give the illustrations in the novel a certain amount of homage. The soundtrack is reminiscent from the 60's, 70's and 80's music which I thought was a good approach to give the scope of its diverse periods, but some may say that this approach hampered the film as it lost a lot of the brooding, moody feel of the source material. There is a good number of sex and nudity, as well as a strong display of violence against women.

Now, do not let my observations as to how it deviated from its source material give the impression that I didn't like the film. Complaints aside, ""Watchmen"" is entertaining enough and it is worth a look. The film is polished with high production values and is a visual marvel that I still have to commend the effort. Those unfamiliar with the graphic novel will no doubt be impressed but hardcore fans of the original story will be a little disappointed. It also does have the potential to turn off some viewers since it does somewhat glorify some harsh realities of human nature (the graphic novel never did that, instead condemns it). It is just a purely ineffective vision of the ""Watchmen"" mythos; while its main premise was faithful to the source material, it never achieved any complexities in emotional and psychological impact. While not an excruciating film, Snyder's adaptation missed the mark that it felt absolutely unnecessary. After more than 2 hours watching Snyder's rendition, to expose certain heartbreaks, satirical touches, nicely shot action sequences, it gave very little in the way of artistry, emotions and thrills that I found myself pining for the source material's philosophical significance. I can understand Alan Moore's request that his name not to be associated with Snyder's vision.

3579386,4,B001FB55H6,"It's strange entering a movie theater, having no idea what to expect from the film about to be seen. The ads for ""Watchmen"" promised a visually stunning superhero movie, and while it certainly delivers in that respect, I never imagined that it would also be such a complex, thought-provoking morality play, one that takes plenty of time to develop the characters into people we can actually invest in. I suppose I could have known this ahead of time had I read the original graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, but to tell the truth, I didn't even know of its existence until the summer of 2008. No matter--the film is a work of art unto itself, not merely in terms of its look, but also in terms of its attention to character and its willingness to tackle weighty political and social issues. The tradeoff is a plot that's often very difficult to follow, mostly because, at a hefty 163 minutes, there's a lot of story being told.

It's a story that takes place in New York City in 1985. Not the actual 1985, mind you, but a 1985 in an alternate reality, one in which Richard Nixon has just been elected for a fifth term as President. Even though superheroes are commonplace, they're all mere human beings, which is to say that they have no actual superpowers. At a time when the United States and the Soviet Union are engaged in a heated nuclear battle, superheroes, also known as Watchmen, are seen more as vigilantes, and it isn't long before their actions are outlawed. Despite having disappeared from the public eye, it seems there's a conspiracy against the Watchmen, who are now being murdered one by one. Kick starting the story is the murder of Edward Blake, a.k.a., The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan); this reunites the remaining Watchmen, who take it upon themselves to solve the mystery of his death.

Most of the film is built around in-depth character analyses, which gradually help to explain why these people are the way they are. The Comedian, for example, is so named because, from his perspective, life is all one big joke. Having been commissioned by the American government to assist in certain operations, he's cynical and world-weary, pretty much to the point of hostility. It would be too much to say that we're made to care for him; we see him do some pretty reprehensible things, none of which I'll describe. We are, however, made to understand where he's coming from. At a certain point, he finds that he's no longer laughing at how much of a joke life is.

There are many other characters. There's Laurie Juspeczyk, a.k.a., Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman), whose troubled mother, the original Silk Spectre (Carla Gugino), had ... an encounter with The Comedian many years ago. There's Daniel Dreiberg/Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), a technically savvy retired superhero, whose ""basement"" is an abandoned subway station filled with various machines. There's Walter Kovacs/Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), the only Watchman to continue his pursuit of vigilante justice. Appropriately, his cloth mask is decorated with inkblots that continuously shift around, and as is the case with a real Rorschach test, he sees only what he wants to see in the world around him. There's Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), the only Watchman who has publicly revealed his identity. It's said on a few occasions that he's the world's smartest man.

The most fascinating character is Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), the only Watchman who has actual superpowers. His story is definitely one for the comic books; he began life as mild-mannered nuclear scientist Dr. Jon Osterman, but as the result of a lab accident, his body and mind were transformed, allowing him to exist beyond mortal notions of space and time. His voice is distinctly human, but his body is a glowing-blue spectacle made of light and energy. Even though he uses his abilities to assist the American government in its efforts against the Soviet Union, it's obvious that he has drifted apart from the rest of humanity. It's easy to see why--joining with the very fabric of the universe must make life as we know it seem awfully insignificant. He makes this point on the surface of Mars, where he unearths a towering sphere of crystalline gears, all of which rotate in very clock-like patterns.

And yet, there's the sense that some part of him, however small, is still human. Consider the fact that, even though he appears mostly in the nude, he always dresses in a suit for important events, like press interviews. How is it that a being from another plane of existence would have even a modicum of humility?

As we near the end of the film, an ethical dilemma is presented, challenging the audience as well as the characters. What it basically boils down to is: Is there a point at which peace comes at too high a cost? You be the judge. All I can say is that it's a fitting question for a film this well crafted, not merely on a technical level, but on a narrative level, as well. It's an ambitious superhero fable that surges with action, drama, and humor, at times brutally violent, at times contemplative, always staying fresh and exciting. It's always risky making a film adaptation, and admittedly, I was worried that ""Watchmen"" would follow in the footsteps of films like ""Silent Hill,"" which was only understood and appreciated by fans of the original video game. Speaking as someone who hasn't read the graphic novel, I'm happy to say that ""Watchmen"" is not elitist entertainment. Not bad for something that was once considered unfilmable.",1236297600,9,5537,4.829293993677555

3579388,5,B001FB55H6,"1st: WATCHMEN is an amazing film adaptation of an amazing graphic novel and you need to see it ( and read it)...

2nd : Neither the film nor the graphic novel is for kids...this ain't the Incredibles (although there are obvious intention parallels on Pixar's part). WATCHMEN is rated R for sex, intense violence and big blue full frontal from the only true super-powered super hero in the mix, Dr. Manhattan. This is actually fairly distracting in IMAX,  but props to the director for refusing to put pants on the guy (yes he does wear pants at some point but this part is true the comic).

If you've never heard of the WATCHMEN now is a good time to learn.... Comic book fans, like myself have been waiting over 20 years for the big screen live action version...Alan Moore's 12 part comic mini-series which coined the term ""Graphic Novel"" and established the genre's ability to aspire to the ranks of literature (Time Magazine ranked it in the 100 greatest novels of the 20th century 1923-2005)...set in the year it was published WATCHMEN tells the story of cold war era world with masked heroes (forced into retirement) who are being killed off. More importantly the story centers on the deconstruction of the ""super hero"" exploring the flawed heroes of two generations of vigilantes. In addition to having lots of costumed heroes around History is different is that President Nixon is still president, currently serving his 5th term thanks to have won Vietnam, using the god-like power of Dr. Manhattan. In fact Dr. M's power is the only thing keeping the super-powers in check, but nuclear war still seems inevitable.
In less than typical fashion, hero origins and backstories are told throughout the movie through flashbacks, some more brutal than others. Although WATCHMEN was a DC comic it isn't set in the DC Universe of Superman and Batman.

But you can tell your players without a  program...The next generation of heroes following in the footsteps of their post-WW II predecessors the MINUTEMEN are...

The NITE OWL II aka Dan Dreilberg, the Batman like hero desperate to get back in action in his the Owl-looking air-vehicle, Dan is probably most heroic and the least flawed of all the characters.

The SILK SPECTRE aka Laurie Juspeczyk, her mother was one of the original Minutemen and Laurie inheirents the role. Gets involved with Dr. M and the Nite Owl.

RORSCHACH  aka Walter Kovacs, kind of a hard-boiled-detective-with-a-grappling-hook, Rorschach is trying to catch the ""Mask Murder"" and probably has more problems than any other character in the story, the villains included.

DOCTOR MANHATTAN aka Jon Osterman, the result of an ""accident in the lab"" Dr. M is the only super-powered character and is blue.

OZYMANDIAS aka Adrian Veidt is the self-styled world's smartest/fittest man. Veidt fancies himself akin to Alexander the Great and is the only hero with the wherewithal to create his OWN action figure line.
The COMEDIAN aka Edward Blake is the murder victim of the ""Mask Killer"" and ex-owner of the iconic-bloody-smiley. Blake is a mercenary feared by the bad guys as well as the good guys. Imagine a sadistic, over-sexed Capt. America.

It has nearly panel per panel recreated the original comic composition of Moore's artist co-creator Dave Gibbons.... the dialogue is almost identical and very few edits were made (biggest cut was the comic-within-the-comic ""the Black Freighter"" which was animated to be released later in full (it is likely that the film pacing is better for the cut). The casting is perfect and thankfully mostly low profile ""unknown"" actors.  The costuming and effects are equally incredible. The art direction, from Alex McDowell and Francois Auduoy,  is on a scale of it's own, with attention to detail that is overwhelmingly accurate to the backstory and lesser details of the graphic novel.

A great and complex look at ""super-heroes."" Like the graphic novel, WATCHMEN the movie, truly explores the highs and lows of the human experience, with or without capes, Moore's words are still powerful and with a running time of under 3 hours, I say, why so short?",1236297600,2,4111,4.9723032069970845
3579389,4,B001FB55H6,"An ex-group of heroes find themselves back together after one of their own is killed. They teamed up in the 60's but now it's the 80's and super heroes are outlawed by President Nixon.

  Now Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) is out to bring them back together. While Dr. Manhattan, the only one with actual powers isn't even sure whether he wants to give up on humans or not. His girlfriend Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) is his only link to humanity.

  However since Dr. Manhattan's so obsessed with his work, he's pushing Spectre into the arms of Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson of Lakeview Terrace). But it's a bad time for Manhattan to give up on humans since bombs are about to drop and he's the only chance in stopping them.

  The movie is often brutally violent and disturbing even. It's far darker than Sin City and the Dark Knight. So don't expect a totally fun super hero adventure. Just expect a complicated but entertaining movie. It has it's share of fun action but some might find that it doesn't have enough action. I still found it fascinating though with some great visuals.

  I didn't really care that there was a lot of talk. I loved the characters and the performances. Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Supernatural season 1, Grey's Anatomy), gives a star making performance like many reviews have said. However, I think Patrick Wilson is also surprisingly excellent as a former hero who won't admit that he misses doing it. While he has excellent chemistry with Malin Akerman.

  Jackie Earle Haley's performance is a little under-rated as well, some critics didn't like it anyway. Yes, he sounds a lot like Christian Bale's Batman when he talks. Yet, he still probably gives the most engaging performance in the movie next to Billy Crudup. He totally owned the character as well.",1236297600,5,1787,4.737864077669903
3579390,4,B001FB55H6,"Director Zack Snyder deserves a lot of credit for sticking as close to the graphic novel as possible, yet changing just enough to not totally alienate someone who has never heard of or read the source material before taking the venture to the local theater.

The visuals are a thing of beauty. The grimy city looks and feels like a living organism. The CGI world and other various visual effects throughout the entire movie are well done, never forcing you out of this alternate 1985. By the way, this flick holds nothing back in the blood and guts department either. Not quite Sin City level, but darn close.

The cast is hit and miss. Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach is by far the best fit of any character in the film. He is just amazing with and without the ever changing inkblot mask. I read rumors that he might play Freddy Krueger in The Nightmare of Elm Street remake. I would have said ""no way"" before, but now I'm convinced that he would be the best replacement for Robert Englund (though I don't think the original needs to be remade). Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian, who is best known to me as the father of the two Winchester boys on the TV show Supernatural, is also outstanding even though he has limited screen time. Billy Crudup's soft and monotone voice actually fit the powerful Dr. Manhattan nicely, seeming to add intelligence to every word. I know a lot of people think that Malin Akerman was miscast, but I quite enjoyed her and thought she brought the right amount of sexiness to Silk Spectre II.

The Comedian's death, the inspired 7 minute or so title sequence and Dr. Manhattan's whole transformation story are the true hightlights, as well as, most of Rorschach's scenes.

Now for the negatives. Patrick Wilson was just okay as the boring Nite Owl II, but I never cared much about the character to begin with. Matthew Goode as Ozymandias was the worst of the whole lot in my opinion. Not horrible by any means, but the weak link for sure. The soundtrack features some great classic rock songs, but other than Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are A'Changin"" over the titles, none really mesh well with what's on screen.  Also, the first 2/3 of the movie are really good, but the last 1/3 does drag and even left me wanting to revisit earlier moments.

Overall, as a casual fan of the graphic novel, I found more to admire than dislike with Watchmen the movie. Those uninitiated into this world may be checking their watch often, but most fans should be happy with what Snyder managed to do with this ""unfilmable"" material.",1236297600,5,2549,4.591208791208791
3579391,5,B001FB55H6,"""Watchmen"" the film, has been a long-awaited and highly anticipated screen adaptation of the graphic novel.  The story begins in 1985 with Cold War tensions escalating and Nixon as President.  The Watchmen, once a group of costumed heroes/crime fighters, are now forced to sit back and watch the world come to the brink of a nuclear holocaust.  Or are they?  No...they aren't.  They suit up and do what they do best and try to put a stop to the impending nuclear war.

The bottom line is that ""Watchmen"" is a fast-moving, visual feast that stays extremely faithful to the source material.  Director Zack Snyder kept an impressively dark vision in re-creating Dave Gibbons' illustrations.  Although some scenes were made shorter, some were cut out, others were enhanced, specifically action scenes that leave the viewer feeling very impressed.

All the characters were exceptionally cast.  Patrick Wilson was perfect for Dan Dreiberg/ Nite Owl.  You will certainly keep your eyes glued to the screen when Laure Jupiter (Malin Akerman) makes an appearance, but even more so when she struts in her spandex costume as Silk Spectre.  Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) was a complete thrill to read in the novel, and continues that on screen.  The people in the film were in awe of Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), and you will be too when you see him.  The special effects for his character were incredible.

So, who watches the ""Watchmen?""  You do.  Or rather you should.  And make sure you watch them in IMAX.  You won't be disappointed.",1236297600,4,1528,4.921568627450981
3579392,5,B001FB55H6,"An alternate version of 1985; A former vigilante and government employee is murdered as the cold war rages in the background. No one seems interested as it appears to be just a burglary gone wrong and even if it isn't this case seems to possibly be over the heads of local police. Rorschach, a vigilante currently wanted for murder isn't convinced however and intends to figure out what happened. It turns out the victim is Rorschach's former teammate the Comedian and this leads him to believe that someone may be gunning for all of the old masked adventurers. He isn't sure why but feels he needs to warn the remaining members of the Minutemen...

Finally someone transfers a comic to the big screen the right way which is for the fans of the original material. The only downside to this is that some of the material will likely be lost on people who aren't familiar with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Watchmen/dp/0930289234/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Watchmen</a>&nbsp;graphic novel.

The Good: Zack Snyder stayed true to the source material and this is always important to the fans and a rarity for Hollywood treatments. All of the casting decisions were excellent as were the performances by the actors. I was especially impressed with Jackie Earle Haley's performance as Rorschach. He absolutely nailed the character. I was slightly skeptical at first when soundtrack began to roll but this also ended up working. The look and feel of the movie were exactly what they need to be.

The Bad: Absolutely nothing.

Overall: Why are you still reading this? Go watch the movie!",1236297600,4,1626,5.218390804597701
3579393,5,B001FB55H6,"I know, I know. Several people are going ""duh"", while the others are going ""but my children are so mature!"" I'm saying that the parents need to watch this film before their kids see it & judge whether or not this film is appropriate for their children. There is extremely graphic violence, sex (for a main run movie) & lots of full frontal nudity (mostly supplied by Dr. Manhattan). The only reason I mention this is because I know there's going to be some idiotic parent who will assume that comic book adaptation means that they can drag their 6 year old child to this film & then get mad when they realize it isn't. Because such parents exist, I'm warning them so the rest of us can enjoy this wonderful film without interruption of such things. Got kids? Babies? Easily offended? Go see something else & leave this film for the rest of us to enjoy. With that being said, on to the actual review.

The film semi-faithfully adapts Alan Moore's beloved comic book for the big screen. There are some parts cut out (the Black Freighter, the Hooded Owl memoir & many sidestories) & a few changed (the squid is swapped if you didn't know), but it is mostly by far one of the most faithful comic book adaptations I've seen in a long while. There's a lot to love in thism movie & most fans will leave entertained.

The plotline follows a handful of retired (and not so retired) costumed heroes as they deal with the aftershock of one of their own has been murdered. One of their number, the highly unstable Rosarch, believes that someone is picking off masks one by one & that all of them are at risk. Slowly other retired costumed heroes begin to believe that there is something to what he is saying.

This film was very well done. The acting was top notch & the directing was spot on. This was not an easy film to adapt, with an overabundance of information to adapt to the big screen & much of it being flashbacks or surplus stories, but Snyder does a bang up job of it. Like one of the other reviewers said, the actors were all beautifully flawed in their acting, which makes for a very realistic portrayal of what costumed life would be like without the costume. The special effects are also well done & the film plotlines run smoothly into each other.

A warning, however. It may take some viewers a while to catch up with everything. I attended with two people who had never read the comic (I had), & it took them a while to adjust to everything that was initially going on & to keep up with everything. Once the film started kicking into high gear, they were well up to speed & were able to keep up. It was just that initially they were a teensy bit confused.",1236297600,5,2662,4.382591093117409

8301585,1,B001FB55H6,"What a confusing pointless movie!  It's all over the place, running in a dozen different directions!

By the end of the first hour, the only thing I knew for sure was that I didn't care about a single character I was watching.  I get the idea.  The idea is that it's supposed to be like a superhero comic-book-type story, but for grownups, with the realities of human nature built-in, like depression, greed, and lust.

In the end, it just doesn't work.  I absolutely do not understand all of the good reviews for this movie.  It's like watching a movie that was written by a manic depressant on crack!

One minute, it's trying to be a great action movie.  The next, a drama.  Then, a love story.  Then an existentialist saga.  Ridiculous.  Incoherent.  Scattered.",1525651200,,764,4.646616541353383
