2561681,1,B000FDK73C,"This could have been a great documentary, informing parents of ways to make their baby feel settled after birth, but instead it was morbidly depressing, and it sensationalized problems with hospital births. Throughout the DVD there was spooky, chilling music; and camera angles and lighting that added a scary effect. There were a few scenes that I enjoyed, such as lovely homebirths- one in particular where the older toddler sister is delighted over the birth of her little sister. But other than that, there were no redeeming qualities to this DVD. The premise was that traumatic birth experiences lead to teenage gang behavior, school shootings etc. This is just ridiculous! There are an infinite number of positive bonding experiences that can occur after a traumatic birth- human beings are far more resilient than this DVD admits. If your baby has to go to the NICU, this DVD will make you feel like they are ruined for life. In reality, I have seen nurses in the NICU and they treat babies with the utmost love and care. The horrific medical scenes of staff treating babies roughly and unkindly are so depressing in this DVD. It was the WORST thing to watch when you are pregnant.",1185321600,9,1188,4.828431372549019
2561682,5,B000FDK73C,"I believe every parent should watch this video prior to having a baby.  This video gives a look at what babies go through prior to, during, and after birth.  If you want to do everything you can to prepare yourself buy this video.  You will be more apt to change your birthing experience buy taking control and being informed of choices nobody else will share with you.  I am a nurse and I found this video very beneficial to the birth I am expecting to give my baby.",1171152000,7,467,4.2727272727272725
2561683,5,B000FDK73C,"This movie is oh-so-necessary for every human being. How a child is veiwed Influences how a child is cared for - and how a child is cared for influences how the child will care for himself, for others and for his own. What Babies Want awakens the inherent knowledge we all have that we are responsible for the success of future generations. What Babies Want validates the need for compassion and empathy in every relationship - especially with our most vulnerable and influential little ones. What Babies Want affirms that our most important relationships begin early, and we can help these relationships be the foundation for the development of emotionally and socially healthy individuals. Debby Takikawa's movie has the potential to change the way every child is viewed; hence, change the care we offer to the very little people who need to know, from the beginning, that they are so loved, honored and respected for the perfectly beautiful human beings they are - and we will do everything in our power to understand and provide exactly what it is they need to survive and thrive as the future of the human race.  Thank you, Debby.",1151280000,10,1135,4.82051282051282
2561684,5,B000FDK73C,"This is a thoughtful and carefully done film about the needs of infants. It includes some great stories from the father's perspective. I particularly enjoyed Noah Wyle's story about his bonding experience with his son. Not much is out there for dads at this time, and I think this film does a good job of including the whole family both in image and word.

Although this is not a ""how to"" film, it is extremely informative about development of the infant. It gives you the information and then you get to decide what to do with it. As a father of 2 with one more on the way,  it pretty much confirmed what I think, which made me feel good. I also appreciate the support of being more informed when I receive ""parenting advice"" or get into the discussion with my in-laws about why I do things differently than they did. It is definitely a resource for parenting.",1150761600,8,861,4.443037974683544
2561685,5,B000FDK73C,"I loved this film! Powerful, real stories showing the impact that birth has on every one of us. How we are brought into this world shapes the person we become.  The founder of cranial-osteopathy, William Sutherland, had a favorite saying, ""As the twig is bent, so grows the tree.""  This film shares with us the way to birthing and raising happy, well-supported and listened to children. Thank you so much for making this beautiful film!

2561686,5,B000FDK73C,"I applaud this documentary!

We are undergoing a dramatic evolution in our understanding of who babies are and what they are capable of. Our 20th century notions of babies are rapidly being revised to include the latest research out of the emerging field of prenatal and perinatal psychology. We understand now that babies are much more conscious, aware, communicative, sensitive, and learning from the very beginning of life. We understand much more of their needs and the lifelong implications of whether we meet them or not.

Debby Takikawa chose just the right title for this document, ""What Babies Want."" She has captured the essence of what is MOST important to babies. This documentary puts you in the fast lane to understanding babies in the 21st century as it introduces you to prenatal and perinatal psychology experts, families, and beautiful birthing moments that inform, inspire and warm the heart.

A wonderful way to view this film is to invite a group of friends, family, co-workers, or community members together and discuss the implications of it for your lives and communities.

Thank you for making this documentary.

8121129,5,B000FDK73C,Arrived quickly and in good shape. Happy with the purchase and looking forward to watching it and better understanding what babies want for their birth day and beyond.,1408320000,,167,5.0
8121130,4,B000FDK73C,"What Babies Want is a documentary that explores the truth that babies are conscious beings, and the implications of that fact.  The film is divided into many chapters: the first several are about birth and bonding (or not bonding), and the later chapters are about how the birth experience affects people and society.  There are a variety of experts that participate in the film, including doctors, a midwife, psychologists, a ""ritual keeper"" from an African tribe, parents, and others, and they each share their knowledge and/or experiences related to the topic.

I really enjoyed the first half of the film and the end.  At the beginning of the film they talk about how the goal is to help our children grow into their authentic selves and ""keep the spark alive.""  I liked that.  They showed how science has found a lot of evidence that babies are molded by early experiences, and that even if they are not totally aware of those experiences, they play them out later.  A lady named Sobonfu Some (a ""ritual keeper"" from an African tribe) was featured a lot, and I liked what she had to say.  Sobonfu Some told about different traditions that her people in Africa have, including telling the babies ""We thank you for the gift that you are going to bring.""  In Africa the people prepare a lot for a baby to be born.  At the end of the film Sobonfu Some said that they have young children in another room when a baby is born so that when the new baby cries out the children can respond--the new baby is basically crying, ""I'm here, is anyone out there,"" and the kids are saying ""You're in the right place and you're wanted!""  I don't know if babies would think of that, but it seemed very nice to me.  I think our culture misses out for not having rituals the way that tribes and older societies did; I think rituals give us something that I don't really understand.

There were a couple quotes that I especially liked.  One was by Wendy Anne McCarty, and she said ""When we come from the belief that babies are conscious, every way we are with our babies changes.  We include them, we know that they're taking everything in, it is imprinting, it is the course of what is life here as human being like?""  In the film they talked about all of the routine hospital procedures that are not very welcoming to new babies, and that those things partially came about because people thought that babies were not really aware anyway.  The thought occurs to me often that my daughter is a real person, and she is feeling her feelings as strongly as I feel mine.  I also have the strong feeling that everything I do for her now, and the way that I treat her now as a young baby is forming the foundation of her life, and I feel like it is critically important that I do things the best that I can.  I take that very seriously, and I felt like Wendy Anne McCarty's quote matched up with how I feel.

After the first half of the film there was a portion that I didn't really connect with, in which various people discussed how non-ideal birthing affects people.  They discussed people acting things out--an example was of a girl who had a cord around her neck when she was born so she put a string around a doll's neck even though she didn't know why.  To me, that seems a little unbelievable and weird.  Although I do believe that all of the hospital routines that do not encourage bonding have an impact, I doubt that single specific moments ""replay"" like an elderly man mentioned; he said that because his head was pushed back in he felt rejected and the same thing played out over and over again in his life.  In my opinion, there was a lot more going on than just that one moment.  If he felt rejected over and over again, his family had more serious problems than just an untimely birth experience.  I think my thoughts on this are somewhat influenced by my reading of Ina May's Guide to Childbirth.  In Ina May's book she mentions times when labor may stop because of some reason or another because we don't feel safe or ready or we lack privacy, or for whatever reason.  So, I think that the birth experience is a fluid experience that may set the tone for a particular way of living, but when this film said that mothers should apologize to babies for things that didn't go right with a birth...I don't know how that could make much of a difference except maybe subconsciously.  A segment of the movie about a lady who was dealing with her birth seemed really weird to me.  They were lighting candles, and I didn't connect with that part of the film at all. 1

The film ended with a great, uplifting message about children seeking a place of belonging.  I liked that.

Overall, I enoyed the film quite a bit.  It made me want to go wake my daughter so that I could hold her!  I think it is important to make birth as gentle as possible and to encourage bonding.  I liked the ideas about helping children feel like they belong and welcoming them.  There was a quote about how in the early years you need to connect with children to learn who they are and what their purpose is, and I really liked that.

I think this would be an especially fun movie for parents to watch while they are expecting.  It shows several birth scenes that are very sweet, without being preachy, and I think most moms would enjoy that, and they would enjoy feeling the importance of the baby they are carrying and the importance of having the best birth experience that they can.",1359417600,,5448,4.431726907630522
8121131,5,B000FDK73C,"No make that everyone should see this. It offers food for thought for everyone and teaches you things about yourself. See this DVD, your baby will thank you :) I had trouble with my copy that I ordered, I then exchanged it and had trouble with the next copy. Still a great DVD!",1240704000,,277,4.245283018867925
8121132,3,B000FDK73C,"I liked the message that birth is an important and sacred experience, not just a medical one. The images of the people with their babies were touching, and I think it bears consideration that parents should plan to the best of their ability to welcome the baby into the world with warmth and peace - however, the scary foreboding music throughout is a bit much, and there is no scientific link (as the movie more than suggests) between trauma at birth and later psychosocial problems, so for the film to suggest it is precipitous.

1) Birth is by its very nature violent and possibly traumatic. Some births are more traumatic than others, and some people will experience suffering later in life as a result of their birth experiences. However, like most psychological phenomena, it is most likely not a simple one-to-one relationship. What traumatizes one person may not traumatize the next. That said, of course a person is likely to be traumatized by not knowing who her mother is or sensing that her mother may have died in childbirth. I am all for healing, but the film's suggestion that births involving heavy medical intervention would traumatize people in adulthood more than smooth births is not proven, anywhere.

2) I had a natural birth outside of a hospital because that is what I wanted to do. However, there are many women of very sound mind who would feel safer and LESS traumatized by having hospital technology available to them. This is just as valid and sound a choice as a non-hospital birth. C-sections are overused, yes, but they save lives and are sometimes necessary.

3) Small but important detail: it is offensive and angering to me that the film would censor/blur a baby's genitals. That act sexualizes something that is not sexual - if that is not a symptom of something dreadfully wrong with American culture, that somehow a baby's genitals would be censored on screen as if they were anything close to a pornographic image - well, the filmmakers, for all their criticisms of our culture, could have used a bit more consciousness/enlightenment on that one.

Long story short: I'd take it with a grain of salt - what works for you, use, but it would certainly be a mistake to apply the film's messages across all people and all situations as far as what's ""good"" or ""bad"" in a birth.",1229385600,8,2311,4.7556109725685785
8121133,1,B000FDK73C,"No stars, actually if I could I'd give 4 negative stars. This DVD is dangerous. I never write reviews, I am too busy, but this one is soo bad I feel I need to warn the ""soon to be and new parents"" (I had a baby just two months ago, so I know the feeling): This DVD is full of unscientifc fear mongering and deceptive untruths. Don't waste money on this DVD that will only make your new baby birth a negative fearfull event instead of being a challanging source of hope and joy. Don't take me wrong, a baby delivery is not a walk in the park, but the final reward is worth all the ups and downs and the result is a new life with a loud reason to hope.
There is no reason to be scared at all!
Specifically, about this DVD:
1. Deceptive: Facts are stated as if they were scientifc, when they are not at all. I wonder how many are real facts indeed!
2. Depressive: The basic idea is that a possible trauma during delivery would compromise the entire life of the baby, leading to violence and crime, dismmissing any possible effect of education and life experience. Anyone with a minimum of brain knows this is not true.
3. Dishonest: things are shown that are totally made up and will only scare you into beliving untruths.
4. Agenda: hospitals are accused of misbehavior and unprofessionalism without providing any prove. There is a clear political intent that is never clearley and honestly stated. I personally think hosptials could do a better job with moral support ... but that doesn't mean I will lie about what they do, just to get my point.

All the above said, here is my suggestion:

Buy or rent this DVD I linked here below instead, it's about taking care of the baby after he/she is born, which is way more important than knowing everything about the delivery, because during delivery you won't be alone anyway, instead after going home, you will feel alone (specially the new mom). So some pratical guidance is important: this one works like a charm!

Oh, if you plan to have a baby at a hospital (some people prefer home births), and you don't have a close female relative/friend who knows about having baby(ies) by direct experience and who is willing to be with you in the delivery room (your mom, your best friend), then get a doula.
Hospitals in the USA (the good ones at least) are your best bet for a baby delivery, but it's true that their staff is very busy, so they will have little time to give you continued moral support during the 24 hrs process  from labor to actual baby delivery (they will explain you everything and assist you at any time but they won't be able to be with you in the room every single minute of the labor process (and even if it was so, you still are the one who has to do the ""hard work"" anyway ;-).  They obvioulsy will be with you 300% when the delivery comes, yet I think that having someone with you at all time, specially if you are unexperienced and have no clue how the labor and delivery works, will help you a lot to keep your spirit up and relaxed, most of all will help the soon to be mom to stay as much as possible relaxed, which in turn will make the entire process easier (easier, not easy, but easier ;-). Good luck!",1227484800,6,3490,4.659090909090909

8121135,5,B000FDK73C,"If babies could talk, they would tell us exactly what this DVD does: that they are aware, feeling, human beings, even before birth, and they deserve the most sensitive care that we can give them.
What Babies Want is an especialy important film at this time, when many parents are drawn to gentle choices in pregnancy, birth and parenting, but lack social support, or may be unaware of the importance of secure attachment for subsequent brain development.

8121137,3,B000FDK73C,"This film has some good material mixed with a lot of questionable assertions.  It paints with too broad a brush.  Much more contributes to our social ills than traumatic birth experiences alone (which, according to the film, means typical in-hospital births).  I, and I'll bet you, too, can think of specific counterexamples to their claims that a difficult birth can permanently shape a person's personality and basically mar them for life.  There's so much more to the picture - people's upbringing, what they are exposed to in school, their neighborhoods, and other social settings, and so on.  Birth *may* be the start of it, but it's certainly not the be-all and end-all, and as another reviewer wrote, humans are far more resilient than this film suggests.",1211328000,3,762,5.015873015873016
