8268078,5,B00180IQ0C,"Bo Schembechler coached with such passion and vigor. He is a true legend of the fall. This DVD chronicles his life and his learning the ropes under another legendary taskmaster in Woody Hayes. But make no mistake, Bo was his own man. True college football historians should certainly include this in their library. They just don't make em' like ol' Bo anymore. He's as much Michigan as the famed winged helmets of the maize and blue.

8268079,5,B00180IQ0C,"The ""Bo Schembekler's Michigan Wolverines"" video is excellent. For those who attended the U of M and enjoyed Big Ten Football in the Big House it is especially attractive. Because much of the content of the video dates to the late 1960s, the format reflects the nature of the TV coverage for that era. Even so, the product was well produced and attractive. The focus on Bo Schembechler and stories about Michigan Football was just as expected. It's a wonderful summary of decades of athletic excellence and Schembeckler's leadership. The is a great book for Michigan sports fans and for students of football history from anywhere.",1328227200,5,630,4.952830188679245
8268080,4,B00180IQ0C,"Alot if the clips in this DVD have been seen in other simliar dvds. There are alot of intresting interviews and a ton of clips from bo's coaching days. If you are a Michigan fan, or even just a collage football fan in general you will enjoy this overview of Bo Schembechler's career. The bonus features are really cool too. good stuff",1219795200,6,334,4.403225806451613
