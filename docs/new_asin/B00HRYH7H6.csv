6201767,5,B00HRYH7H6,"Really, knowing that most of Korean drama/action movies are philosophical in nature, I was afraid that the ending of Confession of Murder will be alike - without a satisfying happy-ending but rather with a deep dark philosophical message. Well this one is an exception and its ending worth waiting. Nice twisted plot, nice high-paced action, very good acting.  Must see.",1397779200,,370,5.166666666666667

I had no idea what to expect when it began, but I certainly wasn't expecting one of the best movies of the year. Give it a go; you won't be disappointed.",1391904000,10,288,4.254545454545455

Would recommend this dvd to anyone who appreciates a good story. I don't have problems with subtitles but a english language track would have been nice.",1406332800,,287,4.647058823529412
6201796,5,B00HRYH7H6,"I've been on a great ride with movies I've watched lately. This Korean gem is no exception. A serial killer murders 10 or 11 women, you'll see, after the statute of limitations run out the killer comes forward with a book he has written on the subject but the law can't touch him. I will not say more about it but this totally loved the actors, loved the dialog, loved the action, loved the suspense and loved, loved, loved the ending...they got me good. Give this movie a chance, I still say Asian films are the best! I'm pretty sure some writer here will steal the idea but it still won't be as good.",1405555200,2,602,4.2894736842105265
6201797,5,B00HRYH7H6,"Serial killer confesses to his crimes after statute of limitations expires. Writes bestseller with details of each grisly murder. Jung Jae-young is excellent as the burnt-out detective. Park Si Hoo hits all the right notes as the handsome, smiling, devil-may-care villain cashing in on his notoriety as a best-selling author. Action from the get go. Mystery. Suspense. A big twist from left field. Very good Korean film that was a big hit. Must see!",1404691200,,449,5.081081081081081

6201801,5,B00HRYH7H6,This was one of those films where your set off on one path only to be confronted by other facts later on. This was great fun.  I loaned it out to my friend and still do not have it back. He thinks it's great too.,1403913600,,212,3.7111111111111112
6201802,5,B00HRYH7H6,"This wasn't what I thought it would be, but I enjoyed it very much. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but I was pleasantly surprised at the few funny moments in this film. This is every bit a cat an mouse game. Also, I think people fail to realize that the normal procedures and customs in one place (in this case, the US) would not be the standard in other places (South Korea - where the film takes place). Meaning, what our cops would do, other cops in other countries wouldn't or can't. I loved this movie. I thought the acting was great. Park Sihoo has a chilling smile anyway, but in this role he really gets under your skin. Anyone that enjoys an intense thriller, sprinkled with a few laughs and a WTF twist, will enjoy this.",1403740800,,739,4.285714285714286

6201841,3,B00HRYH7H6,"Please understand that my wife and I have been dedicated Park Si Hoo fans for years, but we also must be objective on evaluations such as this.  The plot of the film and the surprising climax were both excellent, and for the most part the acting was unexpectedly good.  However, the film was somewhat sabotaged by the director, a former stuntman for other films.  One result was an over-the-top array of totally unnecessary chase scenes and related actions that did not really contribute anything to the story line, much less have much to do with focus of the mystery.  Additionally, the Korean penchant for filming summer and spring scenes in the dead of winter must have been brutal on the actors. And for part of the scenes being filmed in a huge mansion owned by a wealthy character - who apparently was too poor to turn on the heat and to film a crucial scene featuring Park Si Hoo in a swimming pool - again in the dead of winter in Korea - were unnecessary, as attested to by seeing these peoples' breaths in summer and spring!  Yes, a terrible set of ""nits"" to pick but these were significant distractions.",1403049600,,1114,4.55
6201842,3,B00HRYH7H6,"This is one of those movies were the plot is really intriguing, but twists and turns, together with some unrealistic (almost hilarious) scenes make this movie lose its appeal. The director and screenwriters had a great idea for a movie, but should have stuck with one genre, and not jump from strong-thriller, to stunt-action, to comedy, and back to drama-thriller.  A best description of this movie would be a combination of movie plots from Chaser (2008), Wheels on Meals (1984), and I Saw the Devil (2010) with a James Bond action undertone, and Shakespearean ending. Confession of Murder (2012) falls in its own movie category just like The Cabin in the Woods (2012). This movie begs to be re-directed.  Solid 3 stars that is all it deserves. If you have nothing to do and nothing to watch...but why waste time on this film if one can see Memories of Murder (2003) which is much more of a cohesive and interesting Korean thriller.",1402963200,,934,4.7592592592592595
6201843,2,B00HRYH7H6,"Liked the premise but it was a plodding movie, fell back on old cliches and over wrought acting/story telling. Only last 10 minutes or so worth watching.",1400284800,,153,4.703703703703703
6201844,5,B00HRYH7H6,"Warning: This is a Korean movie with English subtitles.  Despite the obvious flaws in this movie, it's still a great watch.  A serial killer is on the loose and is being stalked by a police officer.  There is a confrontation that doesn't end well for the officer.  Years later, the serial killer writes a book confessing to all the murders.  He does this because there is a statute of limitations for his crimes.  Women and the media are entranced by the good looking killer.  The officer wants justice. Or is it revenge? The families of the victims want revenge and plot to kidnap the killer.  But then there's another twist during a televised debate where a third party comes forward to threaten the claims of the killer.  There is a great ambulance chase scene, great acting, and a great plot twist. I'd love to see someone do an American version, but I don't know how they'd get around the obvious roadblocks in our justice system.  But judging how bad American versions of foreign films are, perhaps they should leave this classic alone.  This time, the $3 fee is worth it.  I highly recommend this movie.",1400025600,,1110,4.635897435897436
6201845,3,B00HRYH7H6,"The bad:
Really highly improbable car stunt and other action scenes that had the likelihood and ludicrousness of comic book writing. People jumping from rooftops; out of moving vehicles onto hospital gurneys or tops of other cars while fighting as if no more dangerous than on a kitchen table top, etc. I wasn't sure if it was meant to be spoofing movies that go cheaply overboard in that direction, or not. Decided not, that they were serious. A sadly laughable distraction that lessened the intelligence of the storyline.
The good:
As others will state it has a novel crime thriller twist and turn structure not seen elsewhere. Kudos for that.

Overall score = 3+.",1399075200,,666,4.842105263157895

A real gem of a movie....put on your thinking caps for sleuthing out the murderer...grab a LARGE drink of your choice, and something to snack on, as it is lengthy...but it is worth it
My BEST to the director for his ability to make a true who whodunit movie!",1398556800,,716,4.542635658914729
6201847,3,B00HRYH7H6,"**Spoiler Free**

First off let me say that the actual premise of the movie is fantastic and gripping. Its essentially a Cat and Mouse Mystery Thriller. But who is playing who? So much deception will make you want to know the truth and will be your main reason to even continue watching the film after you see how ridiculously out of place the action scenes are. The action scenes are so out of place in this type of film that I can only blame the Director in his choice of placing them in this type of film. It was like he didn't know what kind of film to portray. The actions scenes seem like something out of Jason Statham Movie (you know what I'm talking about if you seen The Transporter or Crank). They just seem so oddly out of place that they destroy the pacing of the movie. Some action sequences are even unnecessary. A more realistic approach would have made the movie so much better and keep the audience immersed in the plot of the story. All in All, I would recommend a watch so long as you can overlook the action scenes. 3 1/2 Stars.

Better Korean Films to watch:

Old Boy
Mother
The man from nowhere",1398470400,6,1117,4.309523809523809
6201848,4,B00HRYH7H6,"Overall I liked the movie.  The action was decent and the story had some nice twists.  The only things I didn't like were some the totally unbelievable action scenes.  The special effects were obviously FAKElike the first time we see the girl with the crossbow  REALLY LOOKED FAKE and totally unbelievable.  The ambulance chase scene looked really FAKE too.

I wanted to give it 3.5 stars but there is no option for that on Amazon...
Is this movie was in school, it would have earned a B- or a strong C+.  If you want to see a good Korean cop movie watch CHASER or MEMORIES OF MURDER.",1398124800,,584,4.401869158878505

Use of dark comedy and satire walks a fine line with tragedy and pathos but works as only the Koreans can pull off while also making social commentary on the celebrity-obsessed public and media.
