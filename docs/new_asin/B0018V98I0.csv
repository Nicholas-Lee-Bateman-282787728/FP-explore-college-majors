8271262,5,B0018V98I0,"I lived in paris for a year and love the Inspecteur Maigret books and movies in english and french, especially those set in paris.",1366156800,2,130,4.458333333333333
8271263,5,B0018V98I0,"Before you buy this or any of the four Maigret collections, check out Amazon France.  I saved over $200 for the complete set, and my order arrived from France within a week.
But, even if you buy the sets listed here, you won't find a better use of your money: the Bruno Cremer (and you can ignore the others) Maigret series is one of the best films ever made.",1254787200,28,359,4.202898550724638
8271264,5,B0018V98I0,"Maigret episodes are as long as a regular movie. Wonderful settings, engaging mysteries and a detective that has empathy for those just a toe over the line. Violence is replaced by subtle, likeable characters.

Light the fireplace, curl up in your favorite chair and prepare to be delighted.

Downside? They are in french with subtitles, and come in European PAL format. We had previously bought a PAL international DVD player from Fry's electronics for about $150 that plays formats from 50 nations. We bought that because of an English ""Cozy"" detective series called Pie In The Sky that in order to get 5 seasons in one nice package, comes in PAL format. Also highly recomended.

If you liked Poirot or Ms. Marple series, you'll love this. We think it's actually better.

8271265,5,B0018V98I0,This production doesn't disappoint.  Region 2 and PAL format means a region-free PAL/NTSC player is required but easily available.  French with English subtitles allow you to practice your French without missing any of the dialogue.,1221782400,6,232,5.6
