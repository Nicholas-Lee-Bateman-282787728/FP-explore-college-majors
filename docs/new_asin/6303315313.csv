I don't believe moderns would have a clue as to what it's about any more than if they visited a foreign land.  However, history buffs would love it too.

Everything from street games, to Professional games at three ball parks (representing the best in Baseball), to movies, music, radio, is brought back mostly through black and white clips, some from the media, some from the folks.

As a New Jersey-born guy, I can say alot of New York filtred over to West New York, to Hoboken, to Weehawken. The population was not as diverse and the excitement level was lower, but many of us worked in New York, or had friends and relatives there. There was something about it.

This VHS tape much of the production values of Ken Burns' documentaries and it is tastefully done.",1279411200,,790,4.837037037037037
