6942286,5,B00S1LDWA0,"This series has original characters, The plotting is engaging, the scenes of Hamburg are lovely and diverse.  The acting is excellent.  One grows fond of Bukow and Konig.",1438560000,2,170,5.035714285714286
6942287,5,B00S1LDWA0,Excellent in every way!! Thanks lots.,1436227200,,37,5.333333333333333
6942288,5,B00S1LDWA0,"I love this series and will be looking for set 3...if it exists. It takes place in Rostock, a northern German city on the Baltic Sea. The two main characters complement each other...Bukow is somewhat unkempt, doesn't always go by the books, and is a native of the city. His partner, Konig, is the opposite ...straight laced and plays by the rules. The crimes are well plotted and the supporting characters very interesting, e.g. a German motorcycle gang. The series is intelligent, sometimes tense and sometimes violent but thoroughly enjoyable. Highly recommended.",1435881600,,565,5.1521739130434785
6942289,5,B00S1LDWA0,These are really well done with very believable characters.,1435363200,,59,5.666666666666667
6942290,5,B00S1LDWA0,"Bukow (pronounced Bukov) Knig is the current part of a long-running German police series, Polizeiruf 110.  It is excellent.  Intriguing mysteries, with wonderful cultural intricacies. Knig is from West Germany, whereas Bukov has been reassigned to his home town in what was East Germany.  But, thee are sub-plots involving Knig investigating whether Bubov was blackmailed into letting a Russian mafia guy go free, and something mysterious involving Knig's childhood, and all sorts of personal dramas from the police staff.  Very complicated, but the writing team makes it work, and the acting is excellent.  It is a very compelling series, and well worth the investment.",1428710400,5,670,5.403846153846154
6942291,4,B00S1LDWA0,Great stories.. Need more than two seasons!,1428019200,,43,5.285714285714286
8696844,5,B00S1LDWA0,Glad to see there was a season 2; too many times they produce a good series and stop after the first one.  Doubtful they'll have a series 3 but they sure were good.,1525305600,,164,3.9696969696969697
8696845,4,B00S1LDWA0,Good series with a European feel and characters who work well,1498608000,,61,4.636363636363637
8696846,5,B00S1LDWA0,I love this  show,1469059200,,17,3.25
8696847,5,B00S1LDWA0,"So glad they did a second season.  It seems that so many advertise ""Season 1,"" then hook you in and never come back with Season 2, much less Season 4.  We keep up with what's out and what is already showing in Europe and the Scandinavian countries.  America is being deprived of the best unless they invest in an ""all region player"" for DVD's otherwise not available for streaming, which we are so glad we did) and ordering direct from other countries or from amazon.co.uk, because they get them quicker for distribution to Europe.",1463616000,3,531,4.627659574468085

8696850,4,B00S1LDWA0,Will buy the next series.,1444521600,,25,4.2
8696851,5,B00S1LDWA0,"what a great set of characters. Konig is the only one that you can really like. Bukow is an emotional mess who cannot control his temper. What an interesting contrast to the normal cool, calculating cop. We just watched the 2nd episode on the 2nd series. Is Bukow about to have wife trouble also?? Stay tuned.",1442880000,,309,4.535714285714286
8696852,5,B00S1LDWA0,"This is a very entertaining series, Konig's original distrust of Bukow gradually fades, I also look forward to another season Hopefully!!
It is worth seeing with subtitles.",1441324800,,172,5.407407407407407
