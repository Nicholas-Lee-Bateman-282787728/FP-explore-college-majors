8067980,5,B0009WFEDM,Fantastic DVD fast postage and in great quality!  Highly rcommend both the DVD and the suppplier.,1283040000,,97,5.0625
8067981,3,B0009WFEDM,This video was funny - it was a laugh to see these Comedy Stars in their younger days.  But I was alittle disappointed the video was so short.  All in all it was worth watching.,1275264000,,177,4.0285714285714285
8067982,2,B0009WFEDM,"Watching this you can tell that some folks with rights to old 80s clips of Bill Engvall, Ron White and Jeff Foxworthy said ""Hey, let's make a buck off all the yokels buying that Blue Collar Comedy Tour DVD!""  Much of it was shot at the famous Improv (watch the backgrounds) and plenty of 80s hair and clothing can be seen in the audience (and on the performers).

While 3 of the 4 guys are here (nothing from Larry but he was probably still in high school in the 80s), for the most part they're still finding their way in their craft. Foxworthy shows the most polish but even then I didn't laugh all that often. White is seen without his signature scotch and cigar and with shaggy, long curly hair?!? You can see the stirrings of Engvall's ""Here your sign"" schtick but it's not yet formed all the way.

In short, if you're looking at this thinking ""Wow..it's like ANOTHER Blue Collar Comedy Tour!!"": Uh huh. Think again. Ron White has the most ""carryover"" of material (that's a generous way of saying he recycles his jokes a LOT) but outside of him you're not gonna see a lot of ""You know you're a redneck if..."" or ""Heeeeeeeere's your sign.."" jokes.

I'll second what another reviewer said and say that I probably laughed hardest during closing comic Ron Shock's bit about the ""open and shut"" suicide with the .22 bolt-action rifle...from the guy who shot himself 5..5...5....*5* times in the chest. Shock's breakdown of why this is highly unlikely is priceless. (""To shoot myself FIVE times with a bolt-action rifle requires a degree of determination I just don't have..."")

BOTTOM LINE:

Only diehard fans of 1 or all of the 3 Blue Collars will need this. It has its moments but they're too far between. I'd skip this one.",1155081600,6,1725,4.566343042071197
8067983,5,B0009WFEDM,very funny you will laugh you head off.  The Blue Collar guys are as always funny but there are others that should have been a part of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour!!!!!  It is best to watch this video on an empty bladder!,1145145600,,220,4.093023255813954
8067984,2,B0009WFEDM,"Times have changed. Bill, Jeff, and Ron have certainly aged.  Fashion has changed that's for sure.  BUT OH MY GOODNESS, what was up with Ron White's hair?  I think I laughed more at that then anything else on this movie.  I think I had the same hair stylist and the same spiral permed bob haircut!

I have seen many of the current Red Neck movies and know that some of the bits are used over, however, Ron White's performance is the same as it is now except he has changed the locations and I don't think he had the scotch and cigarette.  Oh, and Tator Tot had just been born!

It was nice to see Jeff and Bill doing something other than their famous ""You might be a red neck"" or ""Here's your sign"" bits.  There is one part where Bill does talk about making stupid people carry a sign saying they're stupid or using the skinny end of a fishing pole to slap them on the neck to sort of ""brand"" them with the sign.

If you would like to see how they were back in the day check out this movie.  However, I was a little dissappointed that I spent the money to rent it from Blockbuster.",1138752000,,1081,4.1291866028708135
8067985,3,B0009WFEDM,"This is a collection of old standup bits from Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, and others.  Most of it is from the old ""Evening at the Improv"" shows from the 80s and 90s.  If you haven't seen the comedians before, some of the jokes are funny.  It might not be worth buying but it would be good to rent.

If you've followed the comedians then the only real reason to rent (not buy) this DVD is to see how different they looked back in the 80s or 90s.  Ron White looks A LOT different.  He has a mustache and long hair styled like an 80s pop singer.",1125187200,11,544,4.084905660377358
8067986,2,B0009WFEDM,"This is your typical redneck comedy until the last comic, Ron Shock, does his bit about a suicide committed with a bolt-action rifle.  Hilarious!  Worth it just to see him - but it would be better to just get one of his DVD's from his website.",1125100800,6,243,4.260869565217392
