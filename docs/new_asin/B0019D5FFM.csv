3433482,4,B0019D5FFM,"The movie has a good transfer and I enjoyed it very much. But the problem here lies with the On Demand disc ( again ). The original disc that was sent to me froze up about 1 hour into the movie and went back to the beginning. The nice people at Hodgepodge were able to send me out a replacement copy, which worked fine. I continue to have issues with these On Demand disc's. Some work fine, others I have problems with. So if you like this movie I would recommend it. But be warned that you could have problems like I had. But thanks again to Hodgepodge for working everything out. The final result was a good, entertaining movie that I can enjoy for years to come.",1399248000,12,665,4.203125
3433483,5,B0019D5FFM,"If you are curious about the print, rest assured its very good. The color of the red rocks & canyons around Moab, Ut  look true to life. The movie itself is very entertaining and moves along at a brisk pace.  Jeff Chandler looks good in the role of Cochise. Richard Egan is also good as the sympathetic sergeant. Jack Elam is perfect in his role as Mescal Jack.  Recommended for all who enjoy beautiful scenery & lots of action in a western.",1398124800,13,441,4.353658536585366
3433484,5,B0019D5FFM,This is a great movie pity the company who sells them charges $15 us to post it making it a very expencive movie. This one is also hard for some reason to change to language to english took me three diffrent players to be able to get it to change that asside this is classic chandler he's as wooden as a cigar store indian (woops he is an indian in this film) scenery if fabulas clour and clearness of print if great action is so so but after paying for this from several other sources and getting poor transfers from tv for my money this is perfect just post and handling is the killer fot us here down under.

3433500,5,B0019D5FFM,Jeff Chandler was always my favorite actor.  I remember this movie from when I was just a teenager.  Great fun to watch again.,1416960000,,126,4.434782608695652

3433502,4,B0019D5FFM,"I have been waiting for a few years to find a copy of this western.  I am a grandmother who grew up listening to westerns on radio and then watching them on early television.  I was a huge Jeff Chandler fan.  I ordered this as soon as I saw this was available.  I received the DVD in very secure packaging in a very timely manner.  I opened the DVD and watched it as soon as I got home.  I was so happy because the color and sound was very good.  I had forgotten what a terrific movie this was.  It had been many years since I saw it.  It is a movie from long ago, but I can live without all the blood and gore of some of the westerns today.  I am not a movie critic, I just know what I like, and I loved this.  Thank you Amazon.com for making it available.",1414368000,6,757,3.8506493506493507

8273579,4,B0019D5FFM,"Jeff Chandler reprises his role as Cochise in this prequel to Broken Arrow. You may have problems with a blue-eyed Anglo playing an Apache, but he gives the chief dignity. I'll soon be doing a Real to Reel on this movie at a local theater. So I've watched it several times. The timeline is incredibly out of order. The real events took place in the space of 18 months between January 27, 1861, and July of 1862. They began with the abduction of a Mexican boy, Felix Ward, aka, Mickey Free, from his Anglo step-father. The movie does a good job of presenting the personalities and roles of many of the participants as we understood them in the 1950s. The villains are Geronimo and Baylor. Geronimo had not yet risen to prominence. Baylor was not an evil Indian agent who wanted to do away with the Apache. The real Baylor was a Confederate Lieutenant Colonel and Governor of Confederate Arizona who wanted to poison the Apache. Bascom was an infantry lieutenant who made some missteps but died a hero at Valverde. The move first shows his missteps and then rehabilitates him. Cochise comes off as a wise chief who didn't want war. Movies and novels have their own way of conveying ""truths."" It isn't history. But in this case it conveys some of what we thought of as historical truths in the 1950s. It's watchable and interesting and one of those rare movies that doesn't make all Apaches out to be inhuman demons.",1492041600,,1413,4.58893280632411

8273582,3,B0019D5FFM,"I am a terrible ""nostalgic,"" and looked for this film for ages.  Featuring Jeff Chandler in the continuing role of the great Apache Chief Cochise, it is a sequel. Of sorts to the great western, Broken Arrow, that starred James Stewart and Chandler.  Though not quite as dramatic as Broken Arrow, it is still a good film for westerns fans, is in great condition, and well worth the money.",1483315200,,387,4.594202898550725
