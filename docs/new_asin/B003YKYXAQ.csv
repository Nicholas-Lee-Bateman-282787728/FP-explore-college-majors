8409564,5,B003YKYXAQ,My mother is hooked on Cory Street on the Canadian stations so it's always a good gift to find these special dvds on sale - good priced gift for a fan.  She didn't know these existed.,1440288000,,183,4.083333333333333
8409565,5,B003YKYXAQ,"As an ardent Corrie fan, I found this to be one of the better specials.  Roy, Hayley and Becky are some of my favorite characters; so this adventure was especially good fun.  It is a humerous romp and can be enjoyed in and of itself, even if you've never seen Coronation Street.",1395100800,,278,4.326923076923077
