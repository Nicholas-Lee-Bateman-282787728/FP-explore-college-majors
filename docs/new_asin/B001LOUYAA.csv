8475869,5,B001LOUYAA,"There are some classic shorts in this collection. Who can think of Daffy Duck and NOT think of ""Duck Dodgers in the 24 and a half century!"" Another classic is ""Drip Along Daffy"" from 1951. Here is a spoof on the westerns genre that was so big at that time. ""There's gonna be a sneak preview and the sneaks ain't gonna like it!"" Hahaha! There were some lesser known (to me anyway) shorts here that I really liked. One being ""Stork Naked"", in which Daffy is trying to protect himself from the little bundle of joy that the stork is bringing him. These, along with ""Duck! Rabbit! Duck!"", ""Robin Hood Daffy"" and ""Duck Amuck!"" you just can't go wrong with this purchase!!!
