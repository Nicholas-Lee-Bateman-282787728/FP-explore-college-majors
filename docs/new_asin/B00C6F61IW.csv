No closed captions for the hard of hearing and the deaf. This DVD set specifically said it HAS Closed captions and is even marked
on the back but when I got this DVD .....zip ! No captions or even english subtitles. I had to send it back and get a refund.
I'm pissed at the manufacturer, RLJ Entertainment for releasing these DVDs without the CC option and wonder if they ever bother to check
their products or advertising.

Be warned !

5691915,4,B00C6F61IW,"My name is Bruce and Man with The Screaming Brain are both very much Bruce Campbell films.  He was involved at many creative levels on those films and his personality and humor are absolutely oozing from those films.  Alien Apocalypse is a dud though.  It is just a movie that he did so that sci fi would fund his Man with the Screaming Brain project that he previously had no luck selling.  Alien Apocalypse is only worth watching if you just absolutely have to see everything Bruce has ever been in.  I've watched the other two films several times, but I couldn't sit all the way through Alien Apocalypse because it was so uninspired and poorly directed.",1455062400,5,656,4.572649572649572
