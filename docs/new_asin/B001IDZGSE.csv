8310847,4,B001IDZGSE,"Although my taste in documentary is in the French communist style of Chris Marker, the void in visual rhetoric on this particular topic makes this film/video an original, urgent and lucid filmic account of one of the most important and overlooked periods of organized revolutionary struggle in this country. This moment was the first time police arrested and beat student organizers, the first violent student of color demonstration, and the first time a governor (Ray-gun) called the National Guard on a college campus. That students continue to evoke the TWLF every ten years on the campus, and more significantly, that the 1999 Third World Strike accomplished so much while defending neoliberal downsizing attacks on Ethnic Studies makes this film so very important for activist polemics and instruction. I saw this film at the 2010 Decolonizing the University conference in Berkeley. Open it up or Shut it Down! Unidos Venceremos! Long Live the Third World Liberation Front!",1268524800,,978,5.2756410256410255
