5784042,4,B00D9EJFYQ,"Clive Barker is definitely an acquired taste.  If you love his work this is a ""must"" for your collection.
I am not going to do an in depth review as there are too many of these around as it is!

In my humble opinion, this is definitely one of the most disturbing horror movie franchises. Clive Barker certainly has a unique perspective on this genre. (Watch ""The Midnight Meat Train"" if you don't believe me!)

Overall, one of the best true horror movies around.

If you are wondering why I did not give this 5 stars the answer is quite simple... I reserve that rating for really great movies. Last 5 star rating I gave was for Lord of the Rings (extended versions).",1355356800,3,666,4.390243902439025

5784049,4,B00D9EJFYQ,"What is better for a horror aficionado than one HELLRAISER movie? Two HELLRAISER movies in the same package, for a surprisingly reasonable price. Never mind special features, DVD extras, and all that jazz; what we've got here is a (pardon the pun) ""stripped to the bone"" double feature which showcases the only two really good films in this entire franchise.

HELLRAISER is the story of Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman), a degenerate hedonist who, having run out of illicit pleasures, purchases the so-called ""Lament Configuration,"" a beautiful but spooky-looking puzzle box said to open the gates of ""heaven or hell"" when correctly solved. Frank is so debauched, so jaded and burned out, that he no longer cares which, provided he can go ""beyond the limits"" of pleasure or pain as he knows them. Unfortunately for Frank, he gets precisely what he wants at the hands, or rather the hooks, of four demonic beings called the Cenobites, only to discover, too late, that he doesn't want it. Exit Frank to the sound of screams. Enter Frank's nice-guy brother Larry (Andrew Robinson) and his unhappy, scheming second wife Julia (Claire Higgins), who move into the old family homestead Frank occupied before he solved the box. Unbenknownst to Larry, Julia had an affair with Frank long ago, and still lusts after his memory, so when Larry cuts himself moving in, and the blood re-animates the scattered remains of Frank beneath the floorboards, Julia readily agrees to supply him (Frank) with more blood so he can complete his regeneration and run off with her. To do this, of course, she'll have to murder a number of people, but she's so completely under Frank's spell she doesn't much care. The fly in the ointment is Larry's plucky daughter Kirsty (Ashley Lawrence), who loves her dad and distrusts Julia. When Kirsty discovers Frank is still alive (albeit without his skin), she opens the box and strikes a bargain to deliver him back to the Cenobites, who, let's face it, aren't the most trustworthy folks to deal with. Bloody hell ensues, culminating in a climax as gory as it is satisfying.

Writer-director Clive Barker views HELLRAISER (based on his novella ""The Hellbound Heart"") as a love story first, and he's right, but the real love in the movie is not between Frank and Julia, but between Kirsty and her well-meaning dad, who is the complete innocent caught between horrible millstones. As for the Cenobites, forget it. A more awe-inspiring and mesmerizing gang of villains you will not find anywhere, though I must say Frank Cotton remains one of the most disgustingly evil characters in the history of cinema -- that rare baddie who has absolutely no redeeming qualities at all, yet remains oddly charismatic. And the soundtrack, by Christopher Young, is one of the best film scores I've ever heard. While not a perfect movie, HELLRAISER is a damned good one, a classic to stand the test of time.

The sequel, HELLBOUND is not anywhere near as good taken on the whole, but at its best it approaches and even occasionally exceeds its progenitor. It begins with Ashley incarcerated in a mental institution since, of course, nobody buys her story about cursed puzzle boxes and leather-clad demons. Unfortunately for her, the hospital is run by the sinister Dr. Chennard (Kenneth Cranham), who is obsessed with the legend of the Cenobites and uses his influence to obtain the bloody mattress upon which Julia met her fate in the first film. Through methods too disgusting to recount here, he resurrects Julia and uses a traumatized mental patient who is a savant with puzzles (Imogen Boorman) to ""safely"" open the Lament Configuration, whereupon he begins a tour of Hell with the ever-scheming Julia as his guide. At the same time, Ashley is contacted by the ""ghost"" of her father, who pleads with her to rescue him from that same Hell. Ever the devoted daughter, Ashley, uniting with a sympathetic doctor (William Hope, of ""Aliens"" fame), does just exactly that, and confronts her old foes, the Cenobites, on their own turf. As usual, there is a tangle of different motives at work, lubricated by blood and gore, as well as an unwelcome appearance by the loathsome (yet charismatic) Frank Cotton. More bloody hell ensues, spilling out into the ""real world"" before the ""puzzle"" is finally solved.

I saw HELLBOUND in the theater when it was released, and the scanty audience was extremely confused by the melange of tones in the storytelling. Working from a story by Clive Barker, director Tony Randel labors mightily to recapture the gory yet hi-concept feeling of the first film, and there are moments when he succeeds brilliantly, aided, once again, by a towering score from Christopher Young, and some terrific production design. Unfortunately, the film is hamstrung by the absence of Andrew Robinson, who was low-balled by the studio and refused to reprise his role as Larry Cotton, thus gutting the most poignant part of Barker's original script (which I have read). In addition, the latter portion of the film degenerates into a somewhat incomprehensible mess, at times slipping into a pastiche of slasher horror movies as Chennard takes over from the Cenobites as the movie's principal villain. All in all, HELLBOUND is a glorious and gory mess of a movie, far superior as individual parts rather than a whole, and for all of its flaws, it is infinitely better than any of the innumerable and often unwatchable sequels that followed.

So, my advice is to buy this double feature. Light some candles. Get on your knees. Open the box. And go to hell.",1515283200,3,5558,4.927427961579509

#1: Quality is utter garbage as noted by other reviewers. I don't see the point in transferring a VHS tape to a Blu-ray just so you can sell a Blu-ray. I should have bought the DVD and saved a few bucks. A minor sub-point is that there are no subtitles.

#2: I don't know if these are copy-on-demand or not but mine don't really work. The discs are Region ""1/A"" which should work in the US. Hellraiser did not work on either my region-free player or my US player. Nor my PS4 or laptop or desktop. It does work in my PS3 though. Really?? Hellraiser 2 will not play on anything.

I thought the transfers looked fine (depending on how fine your examination is... but it's better than DVD quality I think)... sound was crisp as well.

The one thing that sucks about this package though, is NO CLOSED CAPTIONING!!  We like having the subtitles on just to make sure we catch every word of the dialog (particularly in sections where it gets quiet or something), but neither of these discs has any subtitles at all.  BOO!!!

As for my opinion of these movies - really I can be happy only watching the second one since it includes much of the good parts of the first movie as an intro anyway.  The second movie has all the cool stuff with the psych ward and much more of the otherworldly stuff with Pinhead and the gang (room of chains in particular), all the Escher-inspired labyrinth scenes, the fun part of seeing Frank in Hell, and all the gruesome ""GET 'EM OFF MEEEEE"" stuff with the bloody mattress.",1446422400,7,1044,4.497354497354498

Subsequent Hellraiser movies seem to fall short as the plot lines significantly deviate from these two.  The first film has a more simple plot line than the sequel, both films are extremely violent and full of murder.

The first film takes place primarily in a single location, which is Kirsty Cotton's new family home.  Her uncle Frank gets resurrected from hell and terrorizes Kirsty and her father Larry.  The second film takes place in a mental hospital where Kirsty has been placed in.  The evil doctor who runs the hospital resurrects Julia (Larry's wife) who terrorizes everyone in the mental hospital, including Kirsty.

They are amazing in the story line and the effects (prior to CGI). I find Hellbound the better of the two but Hellraiser is a classic.  I am not going to go over the plots of both since this has been discussed extensively.  They are classy, gory movies which rise above the rest.  If you find blood and gore disturbing then I would not recommend these movies. IF like me you enjoy good horror that is innovative and disturbing then these are for you.

5784159,4,B00D9EJFYQ,"As a child of the 80's I grew up in the golden age of horror. My parents had Dracula, The Blob, and Frankenstein. I had Jason, Freddy and Michael. I love horror films, but even as a kid, the first two ""Hellraiser"" movies felt different from the other horror films. Maybe it's the tone, maybe it's the Hell imagery, or the excessive, realistic gore? But when you watch these two films, they aren't tapping into the same place as when you watch Jason hacking through campers or Freddy stalking the hapless teens of Springwood.

""Hellraiser"" is a tightly written horror movie based on Clive Barker's ""Hellbound Heart"". Seeking the ultimate pleasure, a man named Frank buys a small puzzle box, and upon solving it, he opens a gateway to Hell. Tortured by demonic monsters known as cinabites. Frank's brother moves into Frank's old house, and when the brother cuts his hand spilling blood on the floor, he unwittingly begins Frank's resurrection.

""Hellbound: Hellraiser II"" picks up right where the first film left off. Kirsty is the sole survivor of the attack by Frank and the cenobites. Of course no one believes her story and she's committed to a mental hospital. Unfortunately, Kirsty's doctor knows she is telling the truth, and he hopes to re-open the. Passage to Hell by having a young girl solve the puzzle box.

Both films are brutally bloody, and after they are over you'll feel the need to shower. ""Hellraiser"" is a much better film than it's sequel, better pacing and a tighter story keep the action moving. ""Hellbound"" features long scenes of people running down hallways and it feels like so much filler.

If you are a fan of 80's horror, then these films are must own. If nothing else you'll be shocked at the level of gore presented in these mainstream films, and Pinhead has become a horror icon.",1412899200,6,1810,4.7365079365079366

And unfortunately the worst transfer of the two is the original film, one of the best horror films ever made.
Time for someone (Scream Factory are you listening?) to step up and give us a high quality blu-ray transfer of at least the original film, which in my book is a classic.

5784185,4,B00D9EJFYQ,"With me, the first one truly ranks as one of the creepiest films ever produced. This is a movie in the genre of ""The Exorcist"" in that it stands alone in the way it being a different way to present terror. This isn't to say the two are anything alike, only they presented horror in new ways. The whole movie seems hell-bent on making you as uncomfortable as it can and with me, at least, succeeds. The character of Frank is as evil a person as has ever been depicted in a film, but his ""reward"" at the end is so horrific that it says with me to this day. The second movie is a bit of a let-down but still far more effective than any of the slapped together, poor attempts to stretch the franchise basing it on the Cenobite commonly referred to as ""Pin Head"". But this package is a good buy as you get enough of the story to be satisfied with without having to get involved with any of the other movies of the franchise.",1386374400,4,919,4.139664804469274
