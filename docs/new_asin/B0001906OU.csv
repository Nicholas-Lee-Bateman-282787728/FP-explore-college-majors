1978833,3,B0001906OU,"I liked this video a lot as a practice companion, but have to say that the actual technique is more for the early beginner in the dance. There is also very little technique taight. You only learn moves that are utilized in the choreography and a little more layering at the ""intermediate"" level I think would be more appropriate. I liked the choreography, but again, it was below the intermediate level of the dance and lacked the drama of the selected music piece. I don't think the choreograohy and the music ""meshed"" all that well together. All in all, Jillina is a very effective and technically advanced teacher (which is made obvious by her performance pieces at the end) and the production of the video itself is excellent.",1118880000,17,730,4.7109375
1978834,5,B0001906OU,"this is a very helpful, informative belly dance instructional video.  it's very inexpensive and worth every penny.  jillina is a talented and professional dancer and teacher.  her voice is relaxed and i really liked that she was shot from behind, in front of a mirror.

i must add though, that her videos are not for beginners. but there are so many that are, it's nice to have some videos for more intermediate and advanced dancers.

i suppose if i had to say anything bad about it, it would be that jillina's dancing is very choreographed, and i miss the improvisional feeling i love so much about belly dance.

choreographed or not, jillina is dynamic and fun.",1112572800,14,663,4.672413793103448
1978835,4,B0001906OU,"I really like this dvd. the routine is fun to learn. I had a pleasant suprise also, the song that she teaches the routine in this can be found on bellydance supterstars track 4. so when you have the routine down you can practice with just the music.",1106352000,3,249,4.208333333333333
1978836,5,B0001906OU,"Let me start by saying, I am a huge fan of Jillina. Her series of instructional DVDs can help anyone see that her talent for dancing and teaching made her into an international star and a favorite among fellow dancers.

As in the first volume, Jillina will take you through a short stretching exercise, followed by proper techniques, then onto the combinations for the choreography. Each time you learn a new combination, you start at the beginning of the dance and work your way through all the combinations that you just learned till you reach the new combination. Jillina explains each move several times so that the dancer can have full knowledge of the moves, sequences, and proper body alignment. Its fairly easy to follow if you've had prior belly dance experience. There is a preformance at the end in full costume (plus a drum solo! Yay!).",1102291200,9,848,4.7687074829931975
1978837,5,B0001906OU,"I took a workshop with her about three years ago.  She was great.  I was excited when I ordered her DVDs this past Friday.  Kudoos to Amazon with thier fast shipping(ordered on Friday got it on a Tuesday).  Well to the DVD.  I am not a professional but a student first off.  I am not sure what the person was talking about in regards to the camera.  During the lesson, the camera *always* showed her body or the part she was working on.  None of that on the face or breasts while she demostrated.  I loved the fact that she broke the movements down and then slowly went faster.  I loved the way she broke up how you get the dance all together.  A comb at a time and then adding more as she goes along.  This was really great.  I would recommend for a person to buy this series as well as go to see her live at a show or workshop.  And Jillina if you are reading this. . .You are really great!  Thanks for teaching your skills.  Oh, and being a bellydancer doesn't mean doing ""cookie cutter moves"".  Putting your own personality or style into bellydancing doesn't mean you aren't a bellydancer.",1097020800,10,1093,4.253658536585366
1978838,5,B0001906OU,"Again, I highly recommend this video along with the other 2 by Jillina.  I am sure that there are others who are saying negative things, but I find a little good in everything.  To be honest, I use some of her moves in my classes.  They are easy to teach, and are fun.  The video is very well put together.  The instructional portion is well thought out.  It's fun and a good video to look at to keep your own routine and classes alive.

At the end of the instructional phases, she puts on a live performance of the taught choreography plus a drum solo.  She's a technical dancer with skills.  I really don't care if she never smiles...she's a great dancers and it shows.

However, there is the issue with the editing during the performance.  I would suggest full body angles.  Other than that, it's a great video.",1095120000,4,814,4.389261744966443
1978839,4,B0001906OU,"I made the mistake of watching Jillina's performance at the end of the DVD first.  It's NOT a good indication of what the rest of the DVD is like.  Her performance, which was done in a dimly lit barroom environment, made my husband mutter something about exotic dancers and poles.  However, the rest of the DVD is extremely well done.  Jillina provides correct terminology for the dance steps and choreographs nice combinations.  Her focus on technique is very helpful and she is an excellent teacher.  Her style will nicely complement what I already know and I found this DVD very enjoyable.",1086048000,16,592,4.811881188118812
1978915,5,B0001906OU,"Jillina's dvds are some of the best DVDs on the market. Certainly for the best price! I have lvl 2 & 3 and her drum solo chorog. and often go back to them since I love the way she puts combos together! If you study it seriously, it's better than taking a 5 week intermediate level class with most live instructors (although live instructors can't be replaced).  The DVD should retail $50 = 4 week session.

Also, I love that she shoots the instruction from an angle, so you can see her back and her reflection in a mirror. It's just like class! It shows her performing the same choreography for an audience so it shows how you have to adjust choreographies to make them work in the field.

It's one of the best formatted dvds too. The catagories all make sense. She walks you through technique, then does combo's, then teaches the choreography which is made of variations of the combos from the beginning of the disc. After each combo of the choreography, there is the 'with music section' which you dance to, then you can stop and she'll dance through the next combo so you can see it before hearing the breakdown.",1171152000,3,1115,4.455882352941177
1978916,5,B0001906OU,I just love the Jillina dvd's. She is very easy to follow which makes this excellent for a beginner and easy for experienced dancers. She repeats the steps which is a huge plus for me.,1167782400,,184,4.285714285714286
1978917,5,B0001906OU,I like her style and presentation.  It was easy to follow and challenged me too.  The studio layout with the mirrors made it easier to follow along too.,1162339200,2,152,4.392857142857143
1978918,4,B0001906OU,Jillina does a good job explaining the different moves. She DOES go very quickly and the first few times you'll have a hard time keeping up. Be patient it is worth it.,1160352000,4,167,4.25
1978919,5,B0001906OU,"This tape consists 5 sections:

1. Stretching

2. Technique

3. Combinations

4. Choreography

5. Performance

In the stretching section, there is a brief warm-up routine to get your muscles warmed up and stretched.  Some people may need to do more stretching, but I'm glad this is a short part of the tape as I like the way it focuses more on learning the combinations and choreography.

In the technique section, the moves that will be used in the choreography are explained and shown with preciness.  Jillina is very good at explaining how your body should move when doing a movement.  The camera is very good at showing the foot work and belly movements.

The combinations section goes over the combos that will be used in the choreography.  In my review of Jillina's first tape, I was not a fan of this section, but now I am because it helps learning the final choreography, which has some slight variations from the combinations. This tape may seem difficult at first, but if you follow the combinations and learn them, the choreography will be so much easier to learn!

The choreography section is where practice is given to learning the dance.  It is broken down into 8 combinations and the dance is repeated from the beginning at each new combination. The dance is dramatic, sexy and playful.  It begins with slow movements, then speeds up a bit and incorporates one floor movement with head swings.

The performance part of this tape is where we get to see Jillina perform a version of the dance.  It's a full belly dance performance and the audience gets to see her incorporate the dance taught in the tape into her performance.  No, it's not the dance taught exactly like it is on the tape as Jillina is a professional dancer and not a beginner so you'll see her put her professional stamp on the choreography.  Just enjoy! It's a wonderful performance by a true belly dance professional!

I'd recommend this tape for intermediate dancers who have had some instruction from real instructors. You won't be disappointed!",1157241600,14,2030,4.762177650429799
1978920,4,B0001906OU,"Jillina teaches you the routine she shows you, step by step, one at a time slowly in front of a mirror, then normal speed & repeating moves she's already taught you to get practice. She's a beautiful dancer, clear voice, simple teaching, no fake smiling during.
Yes, the lighting could be better & camerawork. I also do recomend this not be your first bellydance dvd & try Neena & Veena first to get down the basics before attempting a routine.
There's a trailer at collagevideo for yourself for each of her 3 dvds.",1151625600,5,515,4.548387096774194
1978921,5,B0001906OU,"This video has excellent choreography, and an exciting, challenging routine to learn. The dvd is broken down into warm-up, technique, combinations, choreography, and performance sections. The technique section, in my opinion, is the most useful section to give ideas on remembering moves to do on your own. The technique section includes movements such as the omi, choo choo shimmy, egyptian twist, and zar head movements. But, the technique section is a bit short.

I also wanted more repetition just for the sake of muscle memory. The short time Jillina spent teaching the techniques did grab my attention and kept me focused though. It takes awhile to become accustomed to her style of reviewing from the beginning everytime a new section of the choreography is introduced. The combinations section breaks down the choreography, and reinforces learning, which I most enjoyed.

I wanted the warm up section to be a bit longer, but the video informs the viewer that the warm up is incomplete. I enjoyed the yoga inspired movements in this section. The video, on the whole, is very enjoyable, and Jillina's skill in her performances is very admirable. I cannot agree that this is for a beginner, although it was one of my first bellydance videos, just because of the time spent on teaching moves. One has to become more accustomed to bellydance before beginning this video, because it can be a good 80 minute workout. Plus, the zar head movements must be performed with caution, and are not basic moves, in my opinion, because of conditioning. This is one of my favorite belly dance videos overall.",1140480000,11,1598,4.9812734082397006
1978922,5,B0001906OU,"I think this DVD is great for someone who still don't know how to make their own moves. It's a great way for practicing for your first performance. I am going to be doing my first performance and I have been practicing on this as I don't know how to choreograph my moves yet and so far, I love this DVD. I just keep repeating each section till I'm good at it. I have finished 2 combinations so far, still more to go and having fun along the way!",1133308800,4,445,4.01123595505618
1978923,5,B0001906OU,"I have been bellydancing for a little over three years now, and I purchased this DVD because I wanted to add to the moves that I had already learned. Jillina provides a great breakdown to the moves and performs them in front of a large mirror, which was very helpful. I was able to see all angles of her body while learning them, which is essential. She taught the moves and put them into a routine, then performed the routine live. It was fun to see a live performance, because I could see how she played with the crowd and moved to include every person there.

She has a fun, spunky personality, and the video was overall very enjoyable.",1133308800,11,639,4.369747899159663
1978924,5,B0001906OU,Belly dancing with Jillina is an excellent dvd that teaches how to belly dance in a fun way!,1124150400,5,92,4.166666666666667
8008154,5,B0001906OU,I still use this as a home workout...Jillina is so professional and you will never get bored practicing this over and over.  The music is superb and the bloopers at the end add to her charm.  Excellent for learning belly dancing and techniques while getting in a healthy cardio workout.  I lost weight and I can't even dance now without putting some of her moves into it.,1458345600,,371,4.507462686567164
8008155,4,B0001906OU,"As soon as I put this DVD in the player i knew the material was too difficult for me--a beginner. This is definitely Intermediate material. However, her ""Shape Up and Hips Out"" DVD is perfect for beginners as well as Intermediate students. I love her exercise/dance routine. She and her group repeat each move several times  before going to another move, but it is a complete routine and when it is over you have really worked on the different moves and also put together a dance.""Shape Up"" is a solid work out with four other lovely ladies and has a great feel--much better than this one for beginners and intermediate. In this Level 2 DVD, the student and teacher work alone. It's dark and not enjoyable.",1413590400,,706,4.603174603174603
8008156,5,B0001906OU,"I always watch exercise videos before I do them, and at first I didn't see how I could possibly work up much of a sweat.  There are a lot of pauses and re-starts, and the moves seem simple enough, but I just finished doing the entire thing for the 3rd time and I'll tell you what... I'm sweating.  I will disclaimer this and say I'm not in fantastic shape, though lol.  If you run 5 miles a day you won't be challenged.

This video was exactly what I was looking for.  The first time you do it you will probably have to pause and rewind, but what I love about this video is that it DOESN'T spend too much time on instruction, so that now, as I do it for the 3rd or 100th time I'm not bored with the instruction and can just work on the dance.

The dance is very dynamic and interesting, and manages to be sensual at the same time.

Love!  Keep dancing!",1309132800,,852,4.059880239520958
8008157,5,B0001906OU,"Sections: 1) Warm up--admittedly short 2) Technique 3)The combinations of different steps--with four repeats 4)Choreography done in numbered sets, with a full run through the choreography at the end. 5) The dance done in a club setting.

The combinations leading to a real dance make you feel like you're really accomplishing something--like you're a real dancer! I love her videos for the choreography. So long as you have most of your technique down (some of it from other beginnner videos) you'll love learning her dance.

The number of repetitions (four) when she teaches the combinations might have been fine IF she had put a chapter separatation at the beginning of each one. I mean, if you want to repeat combination number six more than four times, you have to rewind to the correct time because she only has the five large sections separated by chapter--which is absolutely maddening at times. I'd have given this DVD 4.5 stars for the chapter problem and the too-short technique section if I could.",1218240000,,1008,4.958579881656805
8008158,5,B0001906OU,"For some reason, the ability to play on my DVD was difficult.  The logo would load and then nothing.  I've had to order a second set to get both levels 1 and 2 to play without fussing and starting over.

That said, the quality of Jilliana's teaching is excellent with a demonstration of a move and then the practice of it and then the ultimate incorporation into a routine with variables.  Very well done.

If you ever get a chance to see her in a show, it will be well worth your time.  Jillina is poetry in motion.",1217289600,,516,4.214285714285714
8008159,5,B0001906OU,"I've been doing bellydance for over a year, I love it. Jillina is my favourite because of her style, choice of choreography, everything is so beautiful about her. Easy to follow instructions, great organization of the DVD as well as the presentation. Overall, easy, interesting, and enjoyable! I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in bellydance. It's important to have all 3 levels as they progress from simple moves to the more complicated.

8008160,4,B0001906OU,This is a really fun choreography and I enjoyed it the whole time.  My only complaint is that she doesn't drill the combos enough and I kept having to rewind.,1189728000,,158,4.266666666666667
8008161,5,B0001906OU,"It helps when you have the very song she teaches you to dance to, like I do :) (Bellydance Superstars vol. 1)
The moves, if you are familiar with more moves and/or worked on her first dvd are very do-able, but some moves are more refined and isolated, so I got my butt kicked the first time I tried to follow everything. After going a couple times over techniques however, everything was awesome. I liked this dvd especially more than the first because there are many more moves I could utilize to different songs, not just the one given. You know how some dances just go with one song? yea, not like that. I am quite pleased with it because it presents a decent challenge.",1187049600,,673,4.392
8008162,5,B0001906OU,"AT FIRST I DIDNT THINK I WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO DANCE LIKE JILLINA, BUT ONCE I WATCHED THE DVD AND TRIED IT FOR A FEW TIMES I FOUNDED SO EASY TO FOLLOW AND I HAD GAINED LOTS OF CONFIENCE IN MYSELF. THANK YOU

8008163,4,B0001906OU,"Jillina strong point is her choreographies and it shows in this DVD.  Very well produced dvd.  It starts off with a sample performance in costume of the choreography she will teach.  She then does a quick warm-up.  She goes into teaching some movements.  From there she shows combinations 1st without music then practicing with music.  She then proceeds to teach the choreography which is the combinations previously taught just slightly varied.  She keeps patiently building onto the choreography.  In the end she performs in the end in costume.  From her she injects her great sense of showmanship.

Jillina's outfit is beautiful yet functional while she is teaching.  You can see her clearly from the background.

I would recommend this for intermediate and advanced dancers.  I don't think she goes into enough detail for a beginner.",1181606400,,837,5.111111111111111
