6396391,3,B00JXBLIJY,"I love the anime, it claims to be the ""Complete Collection"" but it's missing the Christmas episode, and the DVDs aren't Dubbed and it's Sentai Filmworks, so it's a slim chance that it will ever be dubbed :(",1433376000,,206,4.447368421052632

6396394,5,B00JXBLIJY,"Despite the anime only being in Japanese, season two is just as great as the last season. There's a sleuth of new characters, including Mr. prince/cat himself, Cecil Aijima and senior instructors that really don't want to teach newbies, Quarter Night. There's also a new rival band towards the end of the season, HEAVENS. They are quite mean and I don't get why they weren't disbanded. They were jerks to their fans and to Haruka and STARISH. I know they have to be cutthroat but come on. They didn't have any redeeming qualities. I think the season just wanted to add an antagonist because the series was too happy and fun. Not every story needs a bad guy though. I had issues with Cecil but having HEAVENS overshadow him, he seemed more like a kitten, pardon the pun, compared to the viciousness and down right sneakiness of the mean trio band. I really liked the episodes that focused on Ittoki and Hijirikawa since they are my favorites of all of the guys and it was fun to see both of them so flustered while having to deal with their feelings for Haruka. In all, season two was awesome and fun to watch/ read ( that only subs can provide).",1410307200,3,1145,4.483253588516747
6396395,5,B00JXBLIJY,"OMG waited for this to come out for a long time >.< Absolutely loved this anime,  but by far the 2nd season is my favorite. Definitely buying ^('.')^",1409011200,,149,4.321428571428571
6396396,5,B00JXBLIJY,"Honestly, the Uta Pri series is really good! I mistook it for some stupid harem with nothing new to offer. While it is that at times, you literally get to know each of the characters and in the second season, you learn even more about them! I don't get the hate for Haruka our main girl, although her eyes are FREAKY.......yeah.

We even get a NEW CHARACTER called Cecil, who is a foreign prince. He is pretty cute, and if you are leraning Japanese, it is hilarious because we see his own mistakes with Japanese and it is great fun to watch him correct himself.

I never really cared for Tokiya because season 1 never fleshed him out enough for me to care. I was too busy swooning over Masato Hijirikawa. I don't get how he isn't a popular choice, and I actually like his hair and yeah, I totally have an anime-crush on him.

Season 2 is even more fun than the first, which is a huge accomplishment. The series has become so popular in fact that there's a season 3 coming out and Japan opened a store dedicated to the anime. Even if you haven't seen the first season, it's okay to dive in to this.

The bluray is very nice:)",1407628800,3,1124,4.262910798122066
6396397,5,B00JXBLIJY,"Loved the first Season, but I honestly think this one is better then the first. The story has an interesting turn, and the songs are perfect. You learn more about the main characters and of course the comedy leaves you in stitches.",1407369600,,231,4.523809523809524
