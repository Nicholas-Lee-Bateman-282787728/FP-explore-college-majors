2925758,5,B000UVV22E,"""Cigarette Burns,"" by horror legend John Carpenter, is definitely the best episode, not only on this disc, but also for the entire ""Masters of Horror"" blu-ray DVD set!

And since I don't want to spoil your viewing pleasure by writing a dissertation-long review regarding what it is about, I will only say that if you like a fairly smart script with several twists and turns (with a sort of mystery quality) and a decent amount of gore, then this single episode is a worthy addition to your horror movie collection.

The other two episodes on Season 1, Volume 1, did not make any positive ""horror"" impression on me.  Actually, I don't think I liked them at all (if my memory serves me well).",1298419200,,690,4.59349593495935

2925760,5,B000UVV22E,"This first volume of season I of Masters of Horror is a pleasure in every respect. Cigarette Burns, one of the highlights of the series, benefits greatly from an excellent Blu-ray presentation and an audio commentary by John Carpenter, as well as a separate commentary track by the episode's writers. Another standout episode, Dreams in the Witch House, is given a similar treatment, with a nice commentary by director Stuart Gordon (who directed the best episode of Fear Itself, ""Eater""), actor Ezra Godden, and DVD producer Perry Martin. Unlike some commentary tracks which simply restate what is occurring onscreen or wander aimlessly, these are focused yet relaxed conversations filled with plenty of tidbits of information about the production. The final episode, Fair-Haired Child, wasn't one of my favorites initially, but watching it again while listening to the commentary track with director William Malone and writer Matt Greenberg, I found it much more interesting than I had originally thought. Picture and sound quality are, of course, excellent.",1221868800,13,1060,5.391566265060241
2925761,4,B000UVV22E,"I too came across this series by accident while I was mooching off a friend's Netflix account.  Being a long time fan of horror series such as Tales from the Crypt, I was pleasantly surprised at the overall quality of Masters of Horror.  Though your mileage may vary on each episode, and of course you probably have to be a horror fan to really appreciate the series.
This disk contains three episodes, of which Cigarette Burns (directed by John Carpenter) stands out the most; it's story is quite ambitious for an hour long horror show.
As far as the Blu-ray transfer goes I'm far from an expert.  I watched it with a ps3 at 1080i and the picture looked crisp and clean.  You get 4 commentaries on the disk (2 are for Cigarette Burns).  I can't help wondering with the increased capacity of Blu-ray how many episodes and extras they could have really fit onto a single disk (taking into account that high resolution video takes up more space of course.)",1203638400,14,954,4.555555555555555

Review time!
Cigarette Burns is my absolute favorite episode. It is about finding a film called ""La Fin Absolue Du Monde"" (The absolute end of the world). The reasoning behind this, is NOT because i'm a Norman Reedus fan, while he is a good actor, his acting is a bit flat in this. However, that does not detract from this movie (they only had ten days to shoot it). I'm not going to go in depth into this movie because it's something you have to see to believe. Commentary tracks are decent.

Dreams in the Witch House: It probably would have done better with more time, since it's a bit boring, then it crams it all in as an after thought.  It's about a college student who rents a room in an old house. Then some kooky stuff happens, and mice, and things. It's well acted but rather boring.

The Fair-Haired Child: A decently acted, but slightly over-done story. However! it has Lori Petty, and that's always good. I really don't know how to describe it without giving away anything. The commentary is really sweet though. You can feel the love and thought that went into it",1444435200,3,1420,4.668
