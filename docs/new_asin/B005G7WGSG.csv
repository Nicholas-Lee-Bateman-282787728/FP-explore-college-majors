4689613,1,B005G7WGSG,Omg....this has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever watched.  I kept fast forwarding thinking it may get better...but it didn't...at all!  I can't believe I stuck it out to the end!,1382054400,4,191,4.277777777777778
4689614,1,B005G7WGSG,Kept watching to see if it could possibly get worse! And it did. Great assembly of equally untalented actors and wretched dialog.,1380758400,2,129,4.909090909090909

4689616,1,B005G7WGSG,"This is, by far, the most perfect match of bad dialogue with bad acting I've ever seen twenty minutes of.  Couldn't bear any more than that.
In a word, this film  is silly. Impossible to take seriously. If you watch and hate it, I told you so.",1379030400,,243,4.148936170212766

4689619,1,B005G7WGSG,"I cannot believe anyone spent money making this film.  Worse, I can't believe I paid to rent it.  This is, without question, the worst movie I have ever seen.  The plot is ridiculous, but that's not uncommon.  The acting is horrific.  They couldn't try to be bad and, well, be that bad.  The lighting and sound are awful.",1336694400,3,321,4.448275862068965

4689630,1,B005G7WGSG,I did not like it. It was purely a torture movie.,1466380800,,49,3.5454545454545454
4689631,1,B005G7WGSG,This movie was a disaster! Long drawn out boring scenes of a crazy woman holding a cheating husband and his wife hostage. It was a waste of ninety minutes of my life!!!,1465862400,,168,4.28125

4689636,1,B005G7WGSG,Story is boring. This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. It is only about torture. It is about the worst fatal attraction that might happen. It sucks.,1453852800,2,162,4.09375

4689642,1,B005G7WGSG,I did not watch the whole movie as I do not like violence and torture in my film watching.  The mistress had the guy chained up and was pulling out his fingernails with a pliers and I got out of there then; cant stand stuff like that.,1424822400,,234,3.978723404255319

4689659,1,B005G7WGSG,"Easily falls into one of the worst movies I have ever watched. Watched it late at night without reading the reviews. The beginning was bad and I was hoping it would get better. Unfortunately it got much worse. Don't know how this movie saw the day of light. It should have been killed the moment someone read the script.

Poor story, poor cinematography, mostly poor acting. Ironically, the one redeeming factor is the woman who played the villain - she truly acted like one.",1399766400,,475,4.654761904761905

4689661,2,B005G7WGSG,I watched it almost all the way through.  The torture scene lasted too long.  The film was too dark.  I would recommend that time not be wasted on this film.,1396742400,,157,4.166666666666667
4689662,3,B005G7WGSG,"I totally enjoyed this movie. Great thriller with a good twist. Revenge was another plot twist, but to dark. Hard to see",1395100800,,120,4.5
4689663,1,B005G7WGSG,"Don't be fooled by this being listed as a Thriller. It's mainly going for freaky elements despite advertising itself as a FATAL ATTRACTION clone. The music and lighting holds tons of promise but the actors are far more stale than what you see in a porn flick and the movie bring nothing new to the table for even audiences with low-expectations or even typical indie film gurus. There's a reason this is only on AMAZON PRIME! It's too bad to be released on even DVD.

I saw this wanting simple entertainment and since it was a movie that starred Joe Estevez! He unfortunately was nowhere to be seen and I suspect either had all his scenes cut or was one of the voice-overs on the radio at the beginning but bad is still bad! PLEASE AVOID, it's not even unintentionally amusing as you'll likely fall asleep an hour in or just not know where to poke fun at it to begin with!",1395014400,3,872,4.382716049382716
4689664,1,B005G7WGSG,"Yes, I noticed all the horrible reviews before I started to watch this movie, but I have to admit - I enjoy a bad movie from time to time.  It's like a train wreck where you can't avert your eyes.  This movie, however, was so bad that it couldn't even be appreciated in the bad movie way.

Spoiler Alert!!!

I have to admit - I watched only the first 20 minutes.  As soon as the mistress put the cheater in the chains, I feared that he was going to stay there for the next 70 minutes, which would be tedious and incredibly boring.  I did the thing I never do - skipped ahead - and saw that at over 100 minutes into the movie, he was still in the chains!  No thank you.  I abandoned the movie right then.  It might be unfair to rate a movie that one has not watched to the end, but in this case I just wasn't going to get there.  Spare yourself by skipping this truly loathsome film.",1392249600,8,882,4.017241379310345
4689665,1,B005G7WGSG,"don't waste your time - it was really really awful - the image quality was terrible, the story pitiful and the acting worse",1391990400,,123,4.391304347826087
4689666,1,B005G7WGSG,"This director must have been stark raving mad in order to think of the crap in this movie. It would have probably been a good movie had it had better lighting............it was so dark I started to turn off but decided maybe it will lighten up.........that never happened even when I adjusted my set to 100% brightness. The acting was horrible. The script wasn't so bad......had this budget be that of a Quinton T pocketbook this could have probably been a box office smash with a few changes.  Considering they probably didn't have much to make movie I would say watch if you can and judge for yourself. It's not the worst movie I've seen but it's in the worst basket with the worst. They don't need to use the words Fatal Attraction in the advertising as this is not in the same category as Fatal Attraction. Ewwwww is all I will say.............watch for yourself if you can last through it then give your review. I am rating a 3 because I sat through the entire horrible movie..............no I can't do that ..........wish there was a ZERO rating as this is what this movie deserved. Seriously, Johan Earl....................Ewwwwwwww in a yuckie way.",1389312000,,1156,4.7227722772277225
4689667,1,B005G7WGSG,It was so bad I turned it off when it became apparent the bondage scene was not about sex but was about torture,1389312000,,111,3.869565217391304
4689668,3,B005G7WGSG,"I wanted to see for myself if this film was really as bad as most others said it was.  It was free for me to watch on prime.  It is a very sick plot, that's for certain, and the script could have been better, but it wasn't terrible, and neither was the acting.  It isn't easy for an actor or actress to play a part where they are chained down (or up) for almost the entire film and tortured again and again.  I thought most of the cast in this film did a decent job with what they had to work with.  The so-called music was what was terrible, especially the song during the end credits.  Would I watch it again?  Probably not, but I don't regret watching it the once.",1389052800,,667,4.0458015267175576
4689669,1,B005G7WGSG,"I wish I could rate this with 'zero'.  Poorly written and directed ... the acting SUCKS.  A high school drama class would have been more entertaining. I'm an idiot for sitting through the first fifteen minutes, but kept hoping it would get better.  NOT!  It got worse by the second.  MOVIES THAT ARE THIS INANE SHOULD BE OUTLAWED!  Excuse me while I go puke now.",1384128000,17,362,4.492307692307692
4689670,1,B005G7WGSG,"Do not waste your time, money, or both on this one!  I watched it inspite of the reviews to give it a fair chance and the acting, plot, and story line was way out there!  There was definitely no suspense...every part was predictable and totally unrealistic...Rotten Tomatoes for this one...If you decide to watch this...Just remember...I told you so!  Absolutely nothing like the movie fatal attraction...Totally a low budget film!  Can't say enough bad things about this one!",1382832000,14,476,5.064102564102564

8471280,1,B005G7WGSG,"OMG.  I started watching this movie based on all the bad reviews, curious to see if it could really be as awful as they say.  Let me tell you, it is WORSE!  I really think Amazon should give the nuclear option of giving 0 stars.  Sometimes it is SO necessary.  I watched till the novelty of awesome badness grew stale, then quit.  I have rarely seen a movie in which EVERY element is hideous: the acting, writing, editing, sound, cinematography (I even hate to give it such a professional-sounding name), directing, lighting, sets, etc., etc.--EVERYTHING!  Plus, I'm fully convinced they accidently left out an entire reel, as the continuity at one point is so inexplicable, there can be no other explanation.  The sordid, repellent storyline tops it off.  This is not a horror film--rather a horror of a film.",1520812800,,810,4.76978417266187
