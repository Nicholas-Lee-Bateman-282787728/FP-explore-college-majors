8066973,5,B0009UC7NY,"Review of 3 different purchases September 2005.

 I use either of ""Cyberhome 300 DVD players. All are copyright protected, and you are unable to pick favorites to record on a DVD recorder. Recommend all the below for content (good as you remember), but technical transcription could dissuade you.

1. Andy Griffith Show - complete seasons 1 to 3 - Well packaged, great video, plays from ""play all"" or by individual shows - single sided with a nice graphic and number of disc on each side; has some original commercials that played as separate features. By Paramount.

2. Bob Newhart Show - complete 1st season - double sided, will ""play all"" (memory). With 1/64"" disc name on one side in the inner brown DVD non data ring it's so small I can't read it. I added pen number on inner ring but shows through the other side of the translucent disc. Not for DVD changers. Noted some skips, stalls, and fry's on some episodes. By 20th Century.

3. Mary Tyler Moore Show - complete first season - Single sided - nice folded holder with printed insert of episodes. Numbered discs full size. No ""play all"". To play you must go to the episode, then chapter, then play, after which it stops, shows the chapter, you scroll back up to the menu, then scroll down to the next program. Some grief to me.  By 20th Century.

I  Like the ""play all"" feature  - which probably most of future makes will have - You watch - say two episodes, turn off the DVD, the next occasion  the DVD player is turned on starts with the third one (assuming you didn't eject the disc). Etc.

I purchased all from Amazon for the value and ease.  #1. Was first and I was enthralled - #2.  I read a previous review and understood the double sided complaint, but if the print on the discs was any smaller, a microscope would help (play the silver side, or the silver side with the tiny brown band). #3. - Bummer to back scroll only to forward two scrolls to press play to see the next 23 minute show, then do it again - sleepy - relaxing - Bummer.

All are content worthy considering today's sitcoms, and I laugh loudly again enjoying any of the DVD's.

8066974,1,B0009UC7NY,"Let's see. What kind of person would buy all 3 of the first three seasons of The Andy Griffith show and pay $10 to as much as $32 more than buying them indidvidually? Not me!!!!!! Call me crazy, call me stupid, but shouldn't we get a price break for this, not an increase? It's like going to the grocery store and buying  a gallon of milk for $3.00 and getting 3 for $12.00. At one point they were selling seasons 1 & 2 for $23.39 each and season 3 for 29.24. That is a total of $76.02 for all three. However they are selling the 3 pack for $107.99 for a difference of $31.97. And don""t think you get anything extra by buying all three together. You don't. I guess they must think some people can't do simple math or do not care if they throw away good money.",1124841600,11,759,4.093959731543624
8066975,5,B0009UC7NY,"The Andy Griffith Show is, of course, classic and has been shown continuously in syndication.  Finally, the episodes are coming out on DVD with the closing segments that are usually edited out of the syndication airings. Some of these were important, for example, until I saw the season 1 DVD, I never knew Mayberry got their town cannon back in the Horse Trader after Andy sold it (the guy who unknowingly re-donated it to the town was told the same San Juan Hill story that Andy tried to use to sell it).  The first three seasons demonstrate how the show developed from the hicks from the sticks type humor to the down-home, common sense storylines.  Season three introduces several characters that will be seen again: The Darling family (The Darlings Are Coming), Malcolm Merriweather (Andy's English Valet), and Ernest T. Bass (Mountain Wedding).  My one complaint is why there is not more of a price break when you buy all three at once.  At $27.99 a piece it doesn't seem like you're saving anything. Oh well, whatever the price, they're worth it.",1118620800,17,1053,4.763736263736264
