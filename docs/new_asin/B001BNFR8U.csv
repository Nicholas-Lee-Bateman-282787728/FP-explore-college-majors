8283858,5,B001BNFR8U,"I loved this film. It was well directed and the characters are flawless in their portrayals.
My only regret is Delores Heredia didn't have a bigger role in this movie! Brilliant and very beautiful actress. She has a natural appeal to the camera! She co-stared in Get the Gringo with Mel Gibson.
The other characters are well acted also. The alcoholic father of Malboro and CuCu, an ex-boxer! Who looks like he's capable of a Muhammad Ali flashback at any moment.
If you don't mind reading, this is a great movie! I would recommend you add it to your collection!",1394928000,,561,4.62
8283859,3,B001BNFR8U,"Well filmed, but boring after a while. Demian Bichir not at his best. The dialogs seem sometimes contrived and not natural. Definitely too much melodrama for me.",1390003200,,161,5.0
8283860,5,B001BNFR8U,"I would be interested in seeing more films by this Director, Javier Patron, with the Cinnematography by Patrick Murguia, particularly of a different type (i.e. not getting stuck doing the same kind of film over and over.)  The look of this film is excellent and all of the actors are very good. The ""good"" guys are not any too good in this film, but not all bad either.  The film makes no judgments on the behavior of any of the characters, much of which is pretty bad, just laying it out to be seen.  I did not recognize the names of any of the actors, except Esela Vega, (who I would not have recognized) as the Mother of Cucu and Marlboro (and who gets the award for worst Mother of the year!) (I last saw her in Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia, The Deadly Trackers, and Drum.)  Even the lesser characters are very strong, particularly Martha Higareda as Elisa, Itari Martha as Rocio, Damian Alcazar as Rojas, Delores Heredia as Sara, and the aformentioned Esela Vega as Madre.  You will never want to go to Mexico City after seeing this film, but is a very well-made film. Particularly at the reduced price, this movie is well worth the cost.",1355184000,6,1150,4.431279620853081
8283861,3,B001BNFR8U,"Often the characters speak the phrase ""the truthless truth.""  The oxymoronic nature of the phrase is meant to signify the rough edges of this film.  This film has about three storylines; two come together, but one seems like a red herring.  A man says ""I win and lose at the same time.""  There's a boxing motif that centers around losing matches on purpose.  This is meant to be an ironic, complex work, but it didn't necessarily please my higher-level mental faculties.
I would say we Americans have an image of Mexico as being traditional and conservative, however, this film presents it as having all the risqu'e qualities of the US.  An innocent-looking father figure helps the two main characters commit a highly unethical crime.  Mothers are portrayed as unloving and participating in illegal markets.  A teenage girl that you would think epitomizes chastity admits to voyeurism and has a highly raunchy scene with her mother's former love.
This film has male and female nudity.  One actor, Bechir, looks like U2's The Edge, especially with the knit cap he sports.  However, the Edge has a hairy chest and this actor doesn't.  This is approximately the third Spanish-language film I've seen in which a man wants a former love back when he is the one who caused the break-up; also husbands or boyfriends know that women are cuckolding them and they do little to challenge the women about it.  I wonder if this is a cultural concern or an issue that foreign filmmakers are trying to bring to light more so than their US equivalents.
I translate ""Fuera del cielo"" as ""Outside of Heaven.""  Perhaps the rough edges and dark mood of the work is meant to be infernal.  Maybe this is a way of saying things are not bright and communal south of our nation.",1259020800,6,1753,4.723684210526316
8283862,5,B001BNFR8U,"Fuera del Cielo puede considerarse un de las peliculas mas entranables, evocadoras y emotivas de los ultimos tiempos, es una historia de hermandad, de amor y de pasion por defender la dignidad y el destino que queremos para nuestras vidas, algo que puede ser posible, aun en el peor de los escenarios.",1184976000,4,301,4.8076923076923075
