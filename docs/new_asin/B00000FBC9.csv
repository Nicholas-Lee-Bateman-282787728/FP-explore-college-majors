1206575,5,B00000FBC9,"I'm still waiting for this. My daughter is waiting patiently to get this, along with some other DVDs we ordered from here, but she's really wondering one thing: Where's the rest of Warner Bros. cartoon series? She really wants Tiny Toon Adventures on DVD, as well as Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries, Duck Dodgers, and another volume of The New Scooby Movies. Other than that, we love the other volumes of Animaniacs and Pinky and the Brain. Can't wait to watch them all! Somebody contact Warner Bros. and ask them if they'd release all that stuff I mentioned earlier onto DVD soon! Great collection!",1184803200,,598,4.815533980582524
1206576,5,B00000FBC9,"It's the 3rd volume in the totally insaney Animaniacs. This volume is considerably longer than the other volumes but that's a good thing. This has even more comedic genius than the others. All of the volumes are great. I can't wait for the 4th volume to be released from the Water Tower. Maybe the execs are still deciding if they're too screwy to be released. Until the 4th volume is released ""Goodnight Everybody""!!",1184716800,,417,4.726027397260274
1206577,5,B00000FBC9,"Got to watch these on TV, but didn't get to see all these, this set has Katy Ka-boom and Minerva Mink, the Woodstock is a classic for those remembering that summer, the music.  Wife and I enjoyed these together.  I haven't had so many smiles since I finished Vol. 1 & Vol. 2.  I forget how much music the series had in it, Rita & Runt, and I loved I'm Cute.  I like satire, animation, only one set I never got is ""Chicken Boo"" but someone loved it, part of the set.  Used to watch the old cartoons after school in the 50's from the 40's or before, got to see the TV series while between jobs.  Like Slappy, Mindy, large mallets, anvils, and the classic people who transmorph into zoot suited wolves, such.  This set well worth the money in my book.  Where else could I buy so many smiles and get a sparkle in my eye!  I get to share these with ""my baby"" who reminds me of Dot, and who shares my love of silly laughs.",1184544000,,916,4.072625698324022
1206578,5,B00000FBC9,"Substantial improvement on the second season (I gave it only 3 stars).  The fourth disc is effectively skip-able - there are two or three segments that are entertaining, but not worth the effort.  This is fortuitous: If these weak segments had been littered among the good ones, I probably would have given this collection only a 3- or 4-star rating.",1183593600,,350,4.816666666666666
1206579,5,B00000FBC9,"Yakko, Wakko, and Dot are back and bustin' out with 25 new-to-DVD episodes in five discs of hilarity !

The wacky Warner Brothers and the Warner Sister, as well as Doctor Scratchansniff, Slappy Squirrel, Skippy Squirrel, Rita, Runt, Buttons, Mindy, Pesto, Bobby, Squit, Randy Beaman, Chicken Boo, Katie Kaboom, Minerva Mink, and a gaggle of other original characters are gonna have you bursting out in laughs whenever you like.  Like the first two volume sets, expect a ton of fun with more parodies, puns, schticks, lampoons, and songs more than you can shake a slapstick at !

Some of the funniest episodes include ""The Warners and the Beanstalk"", ""Yes, Always"" featuring Pinky and the Brain, ""Wakko's Gizmo"", ""Woodstock Slappy"" featuring Slappy Squirrel, ""Baloney and Kids"", ""Lookit the Fuzzy Heads"", ""The Warners' 65th Anniversary Special"", ""The Mindy 500"" featuring Mindy and Buttons, ""Pigeon on the Roof"" featuring the Goodfeathers, ""Super Strong Warner Siblings"", ""Deduces Wild"", ""A Hard Day's Warners"", and ""The Kid in the Lid"".  Fun songs of the series include ""I'm Cute"", ""Schnitzelbank"", ""A Quake, a Quake!"", ""U.N. Me"", and ""The Presidents Song"".

If you thought those episodes (and much more) were cool, they've thrown in TWO bonus features in the set !  They are ""They Can't Help It If They're Cute, They're Just Drawn That Way"" (an interview with the artists and designers of the award-winning series) and ""They're Totally Insane-y In Cadence with Richard Stone"" (a tribute to Richard Stone, the great music composer of the series).

The Animaniacal third volume of this rabble-rousing romp of an animated TV series will be a great addition to your cartoon collections, as does the Volumes one and two sets.  I certainly hope volume four is on the way eventually.",1183161600,24,1777,5.124567474048443
1206580,5,B00000FBC9,"Don't let the packaging or bonus features dissuade you from buying this show.  Animaniacs works on a number of levels, can be appreciated by kids & adults alike and even though this gets to the later episodes where Pinky & the Brain have their own show, there are still some very good episodes on here (see them for yourself).

Be happy that the sets are UNCUT and are split into scenes based on the shorts.  If you don't like a particular character, you can skip that one's cartoons & go on to the ones you DO like.  My husband & I love being able to skip shorts we don't like & go on to stuff we DO like such as The Warners, Slappy Squirel & the Goodfeathers.  The animation department at Warner Bros. has been doing a spectacular job on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection sets, Droopy, & this series. (I can't speak for every single animated series by Warner Bros. but I own these).  This effort needs to be encouraged, not poo pooed by people who whine about packaging & bonus features.  At least the Animaniacs sets have CONSISTENT PACKAGING, unlike the 4th Golden Collection set.  Finally, be happy that Warner Bros. is putting this out UNCUT & preserving the integrity of the work.",1182384000,31,1188,4.493023255813953
1206581,3,B00000FBC9,"I love the animaniacs, but Warner Brothers needs to understand that this is still there propperty and it needs to be treated with respect. Therefor, they need to fix the casing so we don't have the discs lying on top of each other otherwise the DVD might crack and break. Secondly Bonus features are scarce how about the feature length movie ""Wakko's Wish"" as a bonus?

Overall, this collection is Sweet and Sour it's not bad, but you can see what could be done to make it better!",1182297600,2,480,4.454545454545454

1206707,5,B00000FBC9,"This was by far my favorite show growing up! I remember wanting to try and record every episode on VHS back in the day, but I could never get home from school in time to catch the very beginning. I'm glad I can now re-watch all those classic episodes and the best part is that I can now fully understand all the adult humor that I didn't understand as a kid.",1436745600,,358,4.056338028169014

1206955,5,B00000FBC9,"Purchased this collection for my son (yeah right) It's a show i can sit and watch with him. The best contribution Warner Bros has made to animation since the original Looney Tunes.  Some of the familiar participants made it to their own shows (Pinky and the Brain), while others are just found here. The whole cast of crazies Slappy Squirrel, the Good Feathers and Rita and Runt as well as Good Idea/Bad Idea made afternoon cartoons in the 80's fun. The sets are boxed well and closed captioned...packed for safety I would recommend them to anyone who remembers the  show (and if you don't you should get them and laugh for the first time now).",1392076800,,644,4.591304347826087

1206958,5,B00000FBC9,"I loved this cartoon series as a kid and I enjoy it just as much (if not more) as a 31-year-old adult. The material is definitely dated as some of its early- to mid-90s popular culture and political references reveal, but I think that just makes it that much more endearing. I will love Animaniacs forever.",1376352000,,306,4.482142857142857
1207036,5,B00000FBC9,"I watched Animaniacs when I was in high school, and was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  It's hilarious, irreverent, smart, and entertaining.

1207038,4,B00000FBC9,"Animaniacs is one unique series, and the third volume has some of the best episodes of the series. However, even though the product was new, the last disc is, for some reason, damaged. If I play it on a  BluRay, there is an entire episode that can't be seen. If I play it on a PS2, only one tiny part of the episode can't be seen. And if I put it on a normal DVD, it can all be seen. Strange, but aside from that little problem, the DVD was really worth purchasing.",1369699200,,465,4.0

Slappy:  Who's that group on the stage?
Skippy:  The Who!
Slappy:  The group on the stage!
Skippy:  Who!...

Also, remember when The Three Tenors (Domingo, Carras, and Pavoroti) played at the Dodger's Stadium?  What would have happened if Slappy had promised Skippy a Dodger's game on that day?  Slappy would do ANYTHING to keep that promise, even to the point of calling in the Mother Ship from ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind""!

Then there are the Warners as Power Rangers?! (Remember them?)  They didn't have to go very far to parody that show!

I have all available volumes of Animaniacs and Tiny Toon Adventures and watch them regularly . . . still laughing!!  And, YES, I do still rock my Wakko key chain!

It makes for an easy way to wind down in the evenings either before supper or before bedtime when conversation may be lagging.  We always get several chuckles and it is interesting to see that our teenagers get most of the same humor that we do, although sometimes the humor relates to topics before their time.  Enjoy!

1207384,4,B00000FBC9,"If not, you need to plug into the Animaniacs - the BEST cartoon series to hit television in the timespan between the original Bugs Bunny cartoons and Robot Chicken.  The dialog is as sharp as any Marx Brothers film and as odd ball as the Three Stooges.  The third volume is worth it all just for the ""I'm cute!"" segment. So what are you waiting for, nice lady? Buy it already, O.K.? Luv you! Bye-bye!",1187913600,3,400,4.32
1207385,5,B00000FBC9,"At the height of its popularity, Animaniacs was shown in bars in college towns.  When I was 15, I took the bus to the Warner Brothers Studio Store to get Rob Paulsen, Jess Harnell, and Tress MacNeille (the voices of Yakko, Wakko, and Dot) to sign my Converse high-tops - which, at the time, was almost as cool as if I had gotten Eddie Vedder or Kurt Cobain to sign them.  There are probably people today who are getting laser surgery to remove tattoos of Wakko from sensitive parts of their anatomy.

Were we all crazy? On one hand, the show was a blatant attempt on the part of Warner Brothers to enhance its brand image - after all, the main characters were CALLED the Warner Brothers (and the Warner Sister).  However, the sheer creativity of the writing managed to transcend the obvious corporate propaganda of the premise.  And it was really, really, REALLY funny.

How well does it stand the test of time? I watched this DVD with some friends of mine and their two-year-old daughter.  The two-year-old loved the singing, the dancing, and the fast-paced animation - and was thrilled by the fact that us grown-ups knew the words to the theme song.  We also loved the singing, the dancing, the fast-paced animation, and the fact that we remembered the words to the theme song - plus, we laughed at the jokes and '90s pop-culture references. (And we took comfort in the fact that very few tattoo parlors are likely to give a two-year-old a tattoo of Wakko on any sensitive parts of her anatomy).

A good time was had by all.",1184976000,25,1526,4.54014598540146
