He showed how to make a few different rolls, not using any raw fish ingredients just veggies and cooked seafood. The chef was kind of silly but the food looked very good. He went into detail about how to make the rice correctly which sounded tricky. Altogether easy to follow and and a bit americanized, good information though.",1263168000,,411,4.6438356164383565
8257871,5,B00158OA48,"I wanted a simple-to-follow instructional source for making our own sushi. Books couldn't approach the video for learning the technique and styles so easily demonstrated here. The producers also introduced a game to keep your attention from lagging, mixing fun with the instruction.

I'm eagerly awaiting the next in the series, and looking forward to expanding the DVD library with Sushi 102.",1230336000,2,393,5.338709677419355
8257872,5,B00158OA48,"When I bought this video I thought I was just buying another how to cook video. I never imagined I would have so much fun learning the art of making sushi. I especially liked the extra ""pop-ups"". They were hilarious. but the ""Just Like That"" game was AWESOME. I watched the video, learned how to make Sushi, I then invited friends over for a sushi party. we all made sushi together and played the Just Like That game. what a blast! The next night. we went to my friends house and did it all again. Who would have thought you could learn how to make sushi and have so much fun in the process? BTW, if you think sushi is all about RAW fish. WRONG! This video taught me that you don't have to eat raw fish to enjoy sushi.

I highly recommend you check this video out, you will also learn how to make sushi. Just Like That!",1205193600,5,819,4.150943396226415
