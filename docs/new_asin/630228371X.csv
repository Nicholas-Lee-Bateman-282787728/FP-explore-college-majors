449811,5,630228371X,"Classy Warner Brothers pic from 1940 features Edward G. Robinson and Humphrey Bogart squaring off as gang leaders, with plucky Ann Sothern along for the ride as Robinson's moll. The first half of this 87-minute film is a straightforward gangster action-comedy, but a sentimental plot twist involving a Catholic monastery (think the 1989 version of ""We're No Angels"" with better pacing) generates some real tension in the climax as we begin to wonder if Robinson's better nature will win out over his old ways. The DVD is loaded with period extras, including a trailer for the film, making it a nice addition to any collection.

What sets this beautiful little film apart from other gangster pics is that it reveals a saintly side to Robinson's gangster persona, allowing him to really struggle with the different paths he might take in the story. While Robinson's mobster pastiche had worn a bit thin by this point in his career, and he was seeking broader roles, we really see something we don't see in his other gangster characters: a heart. The best thing I can say about Brother Orchid is that it's generally unpredictable, not to mention strangely uplifting, and it's not quite like anything else in the genre.

Based on a magazine story, the screenplay is consistently delightful, laden with a comic patter that somehow manages to strike a perfect tone. While I found the cowboy played by Ralph Bellamy a bit hokey at times, particularly in the overplayed stupidity that makes it impossible to understand his character motives in key points, the film's characterizations are generally spot-on. And the actors seem to be having fun.

Even though I tend to get bored watching Edward G. Robinson in many of his better-known roles, as he essentially plays the same nasty thug over and over again early in his career, I never tire of seeing him wrestle with his demons in this one. ""Brother Orchid"" is top-notch Warner studio craftsmanship delivered by people at the top of their game.

449843,4,630228371X,"Edward G. Robinson is indelible as the cocky, but ultimately open-to-influence ""Little John"" Sarto. This role is something of a departure for Robinson. While he's once again a mobster, he's not the gritty, tragic Little Caesar anymore.  Here he's a mobster etched in comic relief, likeable in his scheming self-assurance. Ann Sothern serves as a beautiful foil for his brashness. Her fondness and enthusiasm for him, despite all his derelictions, is infectious.

This movie is actually riddled with star power. Humphrey Bogart plays one of his last second-fiddle roles before he became the leading man. Ralph Bellamy limns an interesting character as far from Franklin D. Roosevelt as you can get. He plays a lovable lug of a cattle baron waiting hopefully, helpfully in the wings for Ann Sothern. He's the kind of undemanding, but still vividly masculine guy-friend that many women might wish existed more often in our modern world.

Then there are myriad character actors whom we've seen a hundred times, but whose names we usually don't know.  There's a very good commentary on this DVD, given by historians of this era in the cinema. They supply the names and movie bios of these hard-working bit players.

They also supply a lot of interesting social history that sheds light on the mores of 1940. For example, the commentators explain how the Review Board insisted that all shots of gangsters now be done with the camera facing them straight on at eye level, rather than from the previous closer-to-the-floor, tilted-up angle which increased the seeming stature of previous gangsters. The Code wanted movies to stop projecting gangsters as heroic, larger-than-life figures. It's enlightening to learn how images and impressions can be changed on the basis of such minute details as a few degrees difference in the angle placement of a camera.

This movie doesn't provide belly laughs. But it has a lot of wry humor, such as in the scenes showing Robinson facing a series of financial debacles as he junkets across Europe getting ""class."" What's more, ""Brother Orchid"" is good-natured and will cheer you throughout. Where else would you get to see Edward G. Robinson wearing what Humphrey Bogart described as ""a mushroom on his head""?",1376524800,2,2239,5.070652173913044
449844,3,630228371X,"""Brother Orchid""
Directed by Lloyd Bacon
(Warner Brothers, 1940)

This is a downright goofy spoof of old-school gangster movies, an offbeat crime-comedy film starring Edward G. Robinson, the king of the '30s gangster flicks, pretty much satirizing himself as Little John Sarto, a tough guy who decides he's had enough of the life of crime and retires as mob boss, leaving the ""family"" business to his lieutenant, Humphrey Bogart. Sarto is a guy who's always looking for the angles, but when he makes a play for a respectable life as a man of leisure, he finds that street smarts don't help much in high society. Discouraged, he comes back to his old haunts but finds that Bogie is the kingpin now, and he doesn't really feel like giving everything back to his old boss. Conflict ensues.

This could have been a serious plot, but it's not: ""Brother Orchid"" is a deliberate send-up of classic gangster films, which were kind of old hat when the '40s rolled around and new, cooler tough-guy film noir icons were coming to the fore. Bogie was the rising star of the new genre, so in a sense we're seeing a symbolic clash of old and new - made literal when the two duke it out in a very gratifying fight scene in the end. In between, there's a faux-maudlin religious subplot that takes Robinson into the service of the Lord, and takes the film into surprising heights of genre parody. It's not really a ""great"" film, but it's certainly worth a whirl if you like the old movies it's making fun of, and in particular if you'd get a kick out of seeing an unusual performance (actually rather nuanced) by the often-hammy Edward G. Robinson. Bogie plays it pretty straight, but there are some fun comedic performances by other character actors, including a broadly comedic role by Ralph Bellamy as a dim-witted cowpoke, and a nice turn from Ann Sothern as the ever-faithful gun moll who Robinson loves to walk over.

In this DVD edition, the Warner archivists add an odd hodgepodge of extras, strung together to replicate the feel of a 1940s matinee, with a newsreel, cartoons and musical short featuring a big band medley by Henry Busse's orchestra. The swing video is the best thing on here... The two cartoons are both pretty weak, third tier toss-offs from the Looney Toons crew, while the newsreel is a story on a horse race at a California track, but the announcer's voiceover has been left off so, it's mainly silent footage, which is kind of neat in a way, but undercuts the illusion of ""a night at the movies"". Mostly a curio.  The main feature, though, is an unusual B-movie offering and worth checking out if you're a fan of this era of film. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1363910400,,2682,4.64

Directed by Lloyd Bacon

While set in a film-noir world, Brother Orchid is an enchanting lesson about how the simple things in life are the best. Robinson plays a gangster chief who quits the mob to undertake a long and financially ruinous Grand Tour of Europe. Returning to the U.S. he is astounded to discover that he can't pick up the reins he once held firmly and that his former under boss, Bogart, wants him out of the way - permanently. Bogart's talent is not very much on display in this movie.

Ann Sothern is terrific as Robinson's ""fiance,"" a gang moll waiting long and patiently for the march to the altar. Ralph Bellamy is amusing as a Western rancher who exudes a patience and understanding more often associated with saints than cowboys.  Ann Sothern as Edward G's girlfriend steals the film in whatever scene she's in.

As Robinson remarks in the final scene, ""I always thought class came with having the right clothes or the right car. But this--this is the REAL class!""

Robinson and Bogart made a total of five films together, with Robinson getting top billing in all but 1948's ""Key Largo"". The others include ""Bullets or Ballots"" (1936), ""Kid Galahad"" (1937), and ""The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse"" (1938). ""Brother Orchid"" was the only film in which Ann Sothern appeared with either Bogey or Robinson. For fans of any of these actors, or of classic films of the 1930's and 40's, all of the above films are highly recommended.

449883,3,630228371X,"Even before ""Little Caesar"" (1931), Edward G. Robinson made quite a name for himself in early gangster films like ""The Hole in the Wall"" (1929), ""Night Ride"" (1930) and ""Outside the Law"" (1930), and on Broadway he was a hit playing Nick Scarsi, a Capone-like gangster in a play entitled ""The Racket"". With ""Little Caesar"" he became Warners' biggest star and Robinson would go on to play in 30 gangster films in a career that included 89 feature films (only Bogart exceeded him with 32 out of 79).

Brother Orchid is a remake, in a way, of the earlier ""Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse"" (1938). Both films starred Robinson with Bogart as the bad guy, Donald Crisp as the good guy, and Allan Jenkins for comedy relief.  Both films involved transformation - ""Orchid"" has the gangster turn into a monk and ""Clitterhouse"" has the good doctor turn into a gangster.  In a way, both films were a reaction by Robinson to having done too many gangster films, and this was his way of showing his versatility. Robinson was such an important star at Warners that the brothers were happy to accommodate him. Moreover, Warners had many troublesome actors (e.g., Jimmy Cagney, Al Jolson, George Raft, Bette Davis) and Robinson was one of the few big stars who cooperated.

""Orchid"" comes at the end of Robinson's gangster era for Warners. The 1940s would see him expand with films like ""The Sea Wolf"" (1941), ""Double Indemnity"" (1944), ""The Woman in the Window"" (1945), ""Scarlet Street"" (1946) and ""House of Strangers"" (1949) and later he would do such notable films as ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956), ""Hole in the Head"" (1959), ""The Cincinnati Kid"" (1965), and ""Soylent Green"" (1973). He did one last gangster film in 1948, ""Key Largo"", in which Bogart was now the big star and, for a change, Robinson gets killed by Bogie.

For years Bogart played second fiddle to both Robinson (""Bullets or Ballets"", ""Kid Galahad"", ""Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse"") and Cagney (""The Roaring Twenties"", ""The Oklahoma Kid"", ""Angels with Dirty Faces"", ""Dead End""), but in 1941 Bogart starred in ""High Sierra"" and ""The Maltese Falcon"" and from that point onward, Bogart became a big name star, eventually surpassing Cagney and Robinson in 1943 on the tail of his performance in ""Casablanca"". Here he is still under the radar as the cheap hoodlum.

Donald Crisp appeared in more than 150 films from 1908 through 1963. He won Best Supporting Actor for ""How Green was My Valley"" (1941) and gave memorable performances in films such as ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1935), ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" (1936), ""Jezebel"" (1938), ""The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex"" (1939), ""National Velvet"" (1944), and ""The Long Gray Line"" (1955). Crisp plays the head monk.

Perky Ann Sothern is best remembered for her Emmy nominated TV shows ""The Ann Sothern Show"" (1958-61) and ""Private Secretary"" (1953-7). She was nominated for a Golden Globe as Best Supporting Actress in ""The Best Man"" (1964) and for an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress in ""The Whales of August"" (1987). Her career spanned 60 years, making her one of the most durable actresses in history. Sothern is a riot as Robinson's moll.

Ralph Bellamy is best remembered for his role as the greedy stock manipulator from Trading Places (1983). He was nominated for an Emmy 3 times over a 30 year period, from 1953 (""United States Steel Hour"") to 1983 (""The Winds of War"") and was Oscar nominated for ""The Awful Truth"" (1937). He starred in the ""Ellery Queen"" mystery films (1940 -1) and gave us memorable performances in ""The Professionals"" (1966) and ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968). I remember him best as Franklin Roosevelt in ""Sunrise at Campobello"" (1960). Bellamy plains a good old southern boy who falls in love with Sothern. It's quite an unusual role for Bellamy but he pulls it off successfully.

Allen Jenkins is the quirky comedy foil who lit up so many films of the 30s and 40s and then went on to a successful career in TV. Along with Jimmy Cagney, Pat O'Brien, and Frank McHugh he was part of the original ""Irish Mafia"" in Hollywood (Ralph Ballamy, who wasn't Irish, was an honorary member). Some of his memorable roles were in ""Dead End"" (1937), ""Destry Rides Again"" (1939), ""Tortilla Flats"" (1942), ""Robin and the 7 Hoods"" (1964) and ""Front Page"" (1974). Jenkins does his usual great job, but he's hardly in the film.

Another actor who doesn't get enough work in the film is the great Cecil Kellaway, who is barely in two or three short scenes and says one or two lines. The pudgy and affable Kellaway was nominated twice as Best Supporting Actor - ""The Luck of the Irish"" (1948) and ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" (1967) - and appeared in over 100 films

The film is directed by Lloyd Bacon who directed more than 100 films between 1922 and 1954. He was part of the Warners production team that cranked out a half dozen films a year, most of them B films. Among his notable films were ""The Singing Fool"" (1928), ""Knute Rockne All American"" (1940) and ""The Fighting Sullivans"" (1944).

Although the action is fast paced and there is lots of great dialogue, the film has its problems. As a comedy, it's not that funny. As a gangster movie, it doesn't have much crime or violence. As an inspirational film, it falls a little short. The inability to decide whether or not it's a crime film with a little comedy or a comedy with crime as the background (e.g., ""Guys and Dolls"") is a crucial flaw.

""Brother Orchid"" was the third foray into the comedy/crime genre by Robinson. As early as 1933 in ""The Little Giant"" Robinson combined comedy with drama in a plot very similar to ""Brother Orchid"", with Mary Astor playing the Ann Sothern role. He did it again with John Ford in ""The Whole Town's Talking"" in 1935. Interestingly enough, the script was written by W. R Burnett who wrote ""Little Caesar"". Of the 3 films, the 1935 film by John Ford is the better film.

Another problem with ""Brother Orchid"" is that Robinson, as good an actor as he was, gets entirely too much screen time, and some wonderful actors (like Jenkins and Kellaway) get too little time.

If you're a Robinson fan this movie will appeal to you. Fans of Ann Sothern and Ralph Bellamy will also enjoy the great performances they put in. But crime and/or comedy fans will want to go elsewhere.",1274572800,,6270,4.75
449884,4,630228371X,"In the depression years there was a tendency even in hollywood to show some people involved in gangster activity as nice guys caught up in criminal behavior because of poverty.
From a moral standpoint, this is ridiculous. Yet, this relic from the era attempts to show that a gangster can become good and is very effective.
One of the best sections of this movie is when Robinson goes to Europe seeking ""class"" and discovers swindlers more clever than he ever was. He is hoodwinked on deals for the largest diamond in the world that turns out to be a door knob, to an antique bed that turns out to have been made recently in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
Returning to America broke, he seeks out his old protective association job only to discover that Bogart won't let him back. He is eventually ""taken for a ride"" but survives to be rescued by monks in a cloisteral existence inside the walls of a monastery. What luck!
He then becomes ""Brother Orchid"" using his savy as a cheat to fool the brothers in minor jobs here and there. Eventually Bogart's protective association even interferes with the attempts by the brotherhood to sell their flowers. Robinson returns to his former gangster life to clean up the problem because he genuinely cares about the honesty of the brotherhood.

449885,5,630228371X,"Edward G. Robinson is somewhat cast against type in this film. It has been years since I have seen this movie; it's never been one that has received much exposure via television. It's a real treat to see Robinson take a turn at comedy; something he didn't do often but he had the skills to do it. Brother Orchid was released in 1940 & was directed by Lloyd Bacon. It's presented in the full screen format (1.33:1) & is in black & white.

Little John Sarto (Edward G. Robinson) has had enough of the rackets after someone in his Protection Agency has knocked someone off. He decides to retire, go to Europe & get some real class. After five years & broke (he's made some incredibly bad investments), he decides to return to New York City & become the head of his Protection Agency again. His former pals welcome him with open arms but it's only a ploy. Jack Buck (Humphrey Bogart, who was still a couple of years away from superstardom) has him thrown out on his ear. Flo Addams (Ann Sothern in a hilarious role) is his long suffering girlfriend. She appeals to Buck that he & Sarto should make up & become partners again. Buck agrees but it's all a set up in order to eliminate Sarto. The hit fails but just barely. Sarto ends up at a monastery becoming Brother Orchid. Brother Superior (Donald Crisp) takes him on as a monk with some funny consequences, everything has an angle & a hustle to Sarto. After hiding in the monastery for a few months Sarto reads that Flo is going to marry a hick cowboy from Montana, Clarence Fletcher (Ralph Bellamy). Fletcher had already been in some scenes earlier in the movie. The scene where he's driving Flo & Sarto to the sanitarium to get Willie the Knife (Allen Jenkins) is a riot, he's doing bird calls while Flo & Sarto are in the backseat talking. Ralph Bellamy made a living out of playing the ""other guy"" who never gets the girl. I don't know for sure but this might be the only movie where Bellamy DID get the girl! I won't spoil the ending for you but it's really a change of pace for Eddie G.!

There are some bonus features on the disc. There's an audio commentary track & several short subjects: A vintage newsreel,""Henry Busse & His Orchestra"" (musical short); two cartoons, ""Busy Bakers"" (color) & ""Slap Happy Pappy"" (b&w Porky Pig) & two trailers, one of Brother Orchid & one of It All Came True. The film restoration is excellent as is the audio track.",1220140800,,2406,4.4411764705882355
449916,3,630228371X,"After spending five years in Europe, trying to become ""cultured"", gangster John Sarto (Edward G. Robinson) returns home to discover that his crime syndicate has been taken over by Jack Buck (Humphrey Bogart) and that his girlfriend has become ""friends"" with, Clarence P. Fletcher (Ralph Bellamy), an alfalfa farmer who seems keen on marrying her. Realizing just how much Sarto knows about him, Buck decides to get rid of Sarto permanently, but Sarto manages to escape and hides out in a monastery of ""Florician"" monks as the titular Brother Orchid.

""Brother Orchid"" has managed to hold up reasonably well over time. This is a light hearted film and although not hilariously funny, the jokes still bring a smile to my face in the more cynical 21st century. The biggest problem with this film is its pacing. It just takes too long for Sarto to get to the monastery (about 45 minutes into a 90 minute film) and too little time is spent there once he arrives (not to mention the fact that none of the monks are remotely three-dimensional in their characters). I feel that the writers missed many opportunities when writing this film, many of which were later explored in the similarly-themed ""Sister Act"". Given the pacing problems, I think that many younger viewers would probably lose interest in this film before Sarto even reaches the monastery.  Nevertheless, my father, who saw this film for the first time as a child, thoroughly enjoyed rewatching it.

Overall, ""Brother Orchid"" is an entertaining movie, and I did like Belamy's character very much, but it's not a cinema classic. Both Robinson and Bogart have made many films that are more deserving of your time than this one.",1208649600,,1682,4.894736842105263
449917,3,630228371X,"""Brother Orchid"" is a 1940 Warner Brother's release starring the great Edward G. Robinson. The first half of the film is a rollicking comedy, not unlike predecessors, ""The Little Giant"" and ""A Slight Case of Murder"", with Robinson as a gangster who leaves his mob and travels overseas in a bid for ""class"". It has the merit of the terrific Ann Sothern as his dizzy girlfriend. Sothern works miracles creating a 3 dimensional and delightful character from cardboard. There are many more excellent supporting players including Allen Jenkins as a henchman and Ralph Bellamy typecast as a hick. The film then switches to Robinson hiding from rival gangster Humphrey Bogart in a monk's seminary. The problem, however, is that the switch to the seminary, trying for cute, is simply dreary and completely unconvincing. Robinson does not look comfortable and Donald Crisp, as Brother Superior, head of the seminary, is at his most sanctimonious and irritating. There are a lot of amusing ideas which lead nowhere. Robinson ends the film in the monastory, giving up his past colourful life and makes a short speech about the goodness of man. This was probably a nod to the war whch was then currently raging but is less than convincing.

The print of the film is very good. This was a quality Hal Wallis production with excellent lighting and camera work. The DVD has some good extras. There is a dull commentary shared between biographers of Robinson and Bogart. Eric Lax, in particular, is the master of statistics and rattles off how many films each supporting player made etc which becomes very tedious. Warner's Night at the Movies is included. The cartoon is amusing with take offs of many characters of the period including Eddie Cantor, Jack Benny and Bing Crosby. The musical short has some entertaining swing from a long forgotten band and there is a trailer for the film and another more entertaining 1940 release, ""It all Came True"" which starred the tantalising Anne Sheridan.

The package is comprehensive like all these Warner's DVDs and best value if purchased as part of the Warner's Gangsters Collection Volume 3.",1207872000,2,2122,4.957865168539326

449919,4,630228371X,"Edward G. Robinson is most well-known from his many crime dramas and playing gangsters but among his best roles were comedies where he often parodied his gangster roles and did so with incredible diversity and skill.  He was vastly underrated as a comedic actor and unfortunately many of his films are not on DVD or even VHS.  Brother orchid is and it's one of Robinson's best comedic performances and maybe one of his best performances period!  This film combines so many genres typical of the late 30's and early 40's, with crime drama, film noir, and comedy elements.

Robinson is Little John Sarto a mobster who aspires to be a man of sophistication and elegance.  He goes to Europe and takes part in things like polo and art collecting.  While he's away Humphrey Bogart, as jack Buck, takes over running the 'protection' operation and doesn't want to give it up.  Sarto recruits a new gang to try and muscle in on Buck's territory but his girlfriend Flo (Ann Southern) unwittingly sets Sarto up for a hit.  Sarto survives the hit and eventually makes his way to a monastery where he is aided by the monks.  Sarto soon finds himself enjoying the serene peace of the monastery and finds his mobster ways being stripped away by the pious monks who come to accept Sarto as one of their own.  But when Buck tries to run the Monk's flower business under, it's time for him to settle the score.

Boy what a really enjoyable movie that his humorous and yet filled with hope and a moral, yet not overbearing message of peace.  The film has an incredible supporting cast including Ann Southern, Ralph Bellamy and the aforementioned Bogart.  Thankfully this one is on VHS and I can only hope someone will gives us a collection of Edward G. Robinson films in the very near future.",1113955200,11,1773,4.626198083067092

449922,4,630228371X,"Edward G. Robinson stars as gangster Little John Sarto, a man fed up with the racket who travels across Europe in the hopes of finding class.  When he returns, he finds his gang in the hands of Humphrey Bogart, his girlfriend Ann Sothern newly wealthy, and himself penniless and still without class.  He tries to get back into his old life, but it proves to be harder than expected, and he ends up hiding out in a monastery of all places!  Brother Orchid came at the end of the cycle of gangster films at Warner Brothers.  It's a hard film to classify - it's part gangster film, part comedy, and also a character study of a man's moral awakening.  Surprisingly, these diverse elements come together well in the film.  The plot is unbelievable, but Robinson fits into the role well, bringing a history to the character through all of his other gangster performances, and also bringing his talent for broad comedy that was not seen often enough.  Sothern is terrific as his patient fiancee, while Bogart doesn't register much as the cardboard bad guy.  Allen Jenkins, one of Warner Brothers best character actors, has some funny moments as Robinson's loyal henchman.  Director Lloyd Bacon keeps the film moving right along, and although this fish-out-of-water story may sound too farfetched, its heart is in the right place and it's fun to watch.",1025308800,11,1344,4.783549783549783
