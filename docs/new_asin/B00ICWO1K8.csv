8640891,2,B00ICWO1K8,"This film was made late in John Barrymore's career and is watchable only by those of us familiar with his earlier films. The plot is flimsy and often dull so this is for those of us who enjoy Barrymore, good or poor. What also keeps this DVD from a higher rating is the poor transfer. Rather than using a vault print, this looks like a badly-framed videotape copy. In fact, the 20th Century opening fanfare is even a poor copy largely with audio while the video cuts out after a second or two",1419465600,6,492,4.301075268817204
8640892,3,B00ICWO1K8,"This is one of John Barrymore's final films before he died in the early 1940s. The title, ""The Great Profile"", was one of his nicknames and really has nothing to do with the film.

Frankly, I'm a little surprised that Fox chose to issue this one as a part of their Cinema Archives series. The plot is rather dull and the ending is abrupt and goofy.  As far as I know, it was never available on VHS tape.

The story revolves around an unreliable actor whose professional and personal life are at wits ends because of his upheavals and indiscretions. His last chance at being employed arrives at his door when a playwright (Anne Baxter) begs him to star in her dreadful (but financed) drama in Chicago. He begrudgingly accepts the part so long as his estranged wife (MaryBeth Hughes) can also have the part of the leading lady . While in Chicago, he gets in a fight with his wife while on stage, goes on a bender during the performance, creates all sorts of havoc and somehow makes the show a smash hit. The show eventually winds up on Broadway, which causes even more complications, but ends up with Barrymore in tights performing a circus act during the show (yes, as I said - goofy).

I've owned this film for several years as a bad taped - from -TV VHS tape, so I knew exactly what I was buying. I've long been a fan of the Fox stars from that time period (John Payne, Anne Baxter, MaryBeth Hughes) and they are the only reason why I bought this DVD as a replacement to my VHS tape.

Would I recommend it? Well .Only if you are a fan of one of the stars.
Like all of the DVDs in the Fox Cinema Archives series, there are no extras (no fancy inserts, no commentaries, no trailers) - just the movie.",1404518400,7,1699,4.313479623824452
