8443260,5,B004VF66VC,"This movie provides us with a powerful example of the ongoing devastation exacted upon the Palestinian people by the State of Israel. Yes, this is a fictitious film in that the characters & specific storyline are created. However, everything else, the state of affairs in Israel / Palestine Territories is fact.  Soraya, the main character, portrays a woman whose grandfather was a victim of the Nakba in 1948. He was forced to leave his home, his belongings and his neighborhood with all of his extended family and friends to live as a refugee in Lebanon. This happened to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in 1948 and what makes this movie relevant now is that sadly it is still happening! Hearing about this situation on the news allows for a desensitized look at the situation, this movie allows us to feel how this ongoing problem affects people. It is accurate and poignant and a must see in order to understand on a personal level how this political situation is affecting us as a human civilization.",1524787200,,1011,4.810344827586207
8443261,5,B004VF66VC,"The movie starts out with a goal to display the reality of life as a Palestinian in Israel, but then the story draws you in for its own sake. Your awareness of the caustic side of life as an Arab in Israel starts out sharp, in parallel with the characters in the movie, and then fades away as the characters themselves seem to find a way to escape from it for a while.

Suheir Hammad is fantastic. She will be culturally familiar to an American audience, who can easily understand how she sees life in Israel and Palestine (specifically, Ramallah). Her character does not leave you mystified as to her motives. Her openness and sympathetic nature render what can be a difficult subject actually very accessible. Above all, while there is a realistic portrayal of the subject matter, there is neither blithe acceptance of reality nor lingering bitterness. The movie is enjoyable enough to watch over and over again.

Moreover, unlike many movies of this kind, the Arabic dialect used in the movie is not too peculiar to follow. Americans who have learned Eastern Arabic as a foreign language will find the Arabic in the movie to be surprisingly comprehensible.",1378339200,,1159,4.79
8443262,4,B004VF66VC,"I have a rather bi-polar attitude to this film.  I loved the performance of Saleh Bakri as Emad.  In the same vein, I thought the depiction of the oppression and harassment of the Palestinians by the Israelis came across very well in the film.  Conversely, I could establish little sympathy or connection with the character of Soraya played by Suheir Hammad.  She frankly struck me as a spoiled kid from the Bronx with little grounding in reality.  She expects to return to the land of her grandfather and magically transform it into the land of her dreams.  She seems almost totally ignorant of the history of the last half of the twentieth century.  Soraya is indignant that she cannot withdraw money from the bank of a state that ceased to exist in 1948.  She returns to her grandfather's home and wants the present occupant to leave and give it to her, because it was taken and her grandfather forcibly displaced.  In that situation she can join about 20% of the human race since WWII, including the Jews, virtually all Germans living east of the Oder River, Chinese Nationalists, Vietnamese, Cambodians. . .the list can go on and on.  In short, there is nothing really special in her circumstance.

That being said, one must wonder if this is precisely the effect the writer meant to convey.  We consistently see the juxtaposition of Soraya and the ease with which she can hoodwink the Israelis given her English fluency, and Emad, who becomes increasingly disgusted with the charade.  Emad, living in the land of his birth and ancestors, is treated almost like a captive, whereas Soraya, and outsider, is treated with respect.

I enjoyed the film and felt it conveyed the oppressive and claustrophobic atmosphere of the West Bank and the Palestinian dilemma.",1327795200,3,1764,4.836666666666667
8443263,3,B004VF66VC,"From an American cultural perspective, which is of course very limited, the portrait of an American citizen of Palestinian heritage returning to Palestine to remain, rob a bank, and then attempt to reclaim her grandfather's home now on Israeli territory, is a bit strained. Especially the robbing the bank part. We get nothing of her life in the US to help us understand why this headstrong woman's undertakes such dangerous missions, which are a risk to herself and to her Palestinian lover, who, we may assume, has returned to an Israeli jail while she gets sent back to the States. All we know about her is that she is broke and has come to Palestine on inheritance money she has received, and wishes to get her grandfather's money from a Palestinian branch bank. There's a fine complex mix of honest human motives here. She's attached to her family, loves the land, and needs the money and a home. Her sense of entitlement is very strong. One wonders if this is an individual trait, and Palestinian trait, or an American trait. Perhaps a mix of all three.
  Although the story may seem a bit strained and ""Hollywood"" to some, it is a good vehicle to present the sufferings and lack of opportunities for Palestinians in the region today, and a way to see what the land and cities look like. You get to see the infamous wall Israel built to separate the Palestinians from them and in the process stole more land.",1326240000,3,1414,4.629482071713148
8443264,5,B004VF66VC,"Fundamentally this is an epic poem on film of decades-long yearning for return to one's ancestral home...to touch the soil, breathe the air of her grandfather's stolen homeland....which Brooklyn raised  Suheir Hammad, Palestinian poet /lovely actress infused with her own family's experience, perhaps.  She embodies the righteous grief, alienation and longing that most Diaspora Palestinians carry throughout their lives but in this artful fiction, she not only returns but lives out the unexpressed unfulfilled need to find (and regain) her ancestral home, now occupied, as is the land itself.  Through this journey 'of return' for this protagonist... walls which exist are overcome one way or another....as in any dream there is a sense of the surreal...to overcome tribulation and to succeed....this is a universal homecoming....for all who have ever coped with an unrealized yearning to go ""HOME"".",1320192000,3,901,5.562043795620438
8443265,4,B004VF66VC,"Anyone who has gone through an oppressive search by the TSA knows how humiliating and disempowering it can be. But, as we see in the opening scene of Salt of this Sea, it's nothing compared to the routine degradation inflicted on Palestinians by Israeli security forces.

Brooklyn-born Palestinian Soraya (Suheir Hammad) has always longed to take a roots journey back to her grandparents' homeland, from which they were forcibly exiled in 1948. But her experience turns dark from these very first moments after touchdown at the airport, when she is repeatedly interrogated and searched for no reason other than her surname. Things go from bad to worse when a British-controlled bank in the West Bank city of Ramallah refuses her request for her grandfather's long-vanished money.

She and her disillusioned lover Emad (Saleh Bakri) and his filmmaker friend Marwan (Riyad Ideis) respond to the rampant injustices by committing a crime and going on the lam in Israel, where they end up at her grandfather's old home, now owned by an idealistic young Jewish woman who has no clue as to the history embedded in the beautiful tiles on the kitchen floor.

Through the starkly discrepant treatment our protagonists receive on the streets and at military checkpoints, depending on whether or not the men are sporting yarmulkes, award-winning director Annemarie Jacir powerfully illustrates the day-to-day injustices experienced by Palestinians in Israel.

The excellent acting and cinematography allow us to forgive the somewhat incredible stubbornness of our rebellious protagonist, who insists on maintaining her honesty and political principles in spite of grave risks to both herself and her newfound friends.

Overall, this is an important film that gives witness to the experiences of a displaced minority whose perspectives are rarely seen on film. I highly recommend it.",1319932800,7,1870,5.3254237288135595
8443266,5,B004VF66VC,"This was a wonderful movie to watch, the arabic spoken is crisp and clear and the sub-titles are very accurate.  This movie shows the humiliation and brutality that is an every day reality in the occupied territories.

I traveled to the West Bank for myself and can bear witness to the facts presented in this movie.  If you are a human being that cares about justice in the world, this is a movie you cannot pass up.

Salam, Shalom, Peace.",1313712000,15,440,4.4625
8443267,4,B004VF66VC,"An American woman from Brooklyn (grandparents Palestinian and evacuated (ousted is more precise) to a Lebanese refugee camp in 1948, parents born in Lebanon and emigrated to the US) comes to Israel to retrace her family's roots.  She seeks the 315 Palestinian pounds her grandfather left behind in the bank.  The money is long gone.  The family house belongs to an Israeli woman.  The house is still tiled with the tiles her grandfather laid down.  She strikes up a friendship with two men in Ramallah, one of whom has not left Ramallah for 17 years.  And has never seen the sea.  We see her arrival at the airport and the humiliations she experiences.  We see the roadblocks and the searches.  The three commit a crime and escape to inner-Israel, Jewish Israel, where Arabs must have ID cards.  It is an exhilarating road trip for awhile.  A day at the sea, going to her grandfather's house and being invited to stay by the Israel woman who now owns it, and surprise surprise--these few days do not end well. Camping in ruins of an old Arab town which is now a national park, and this, too, does not end well.

This is the first Palestinian film by a woman.  The ""little murders"" that occur at the hands of the occupiers are filtered through a woman's sensibility.

There is no other way:  there must be a two state solution.  This is not the message of the film.  This is my opinion.",1312588800,6,1385,4.520161290322581
