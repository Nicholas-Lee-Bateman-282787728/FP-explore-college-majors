351575,3,6301640594,"Patrick Swaze is the big city cop from the backwoods whose younger brother is shot dead by the mob and he vows to track down those responsible.
  However,when he takes his brothers body home to be buried,his elder  brother,loose cannon Liam Neeson,is disappointed with the lack of direct  action;and threatens to become involved.
  Neeson does become  involved with tragic results which brings a variety of strange hillbilly  types into the big smoke to extract retribution.
  Reasonable  action thriller,but could have done with more of""the kin""and  Michael J Pollard;now approaching the veteran stage;steals every scene he  appears in.",959472000,8,637,5.443298969072165
351576,4,6301640594,"Let's face it, Patrick Swayze's 1980s ouevre is a guilty pleasure... Dirty Dancing, Road House, Uncommon Valor, and of course Next of Kin.
One of the best things about this movie is the chance to see some of the hottest  stars of the 1990s in supporting roles... Ben Stiller as a mafia boss' son,  Helen Hunt as Swayze's wife, Bill Paxton and Liam Neeson as Swayze's  hillbilly brothers.
It also has one of the greatest Swayze quotes...  ""You ain't seen bad yet.  But it's comin'.""
Definitely high on  the guilty pleasure scale, Next of Kin is a must-watch for those who enjoy  a film's kitsch factor.",952905600,5,601,4.613207547169812
351577,3,6301640594,THIS IS PATRICK SWAYZE'S BEST MOVIE. THE BEST PART OF THE MOVIE IS WHEN ALL HIS KIN START GETTING CALLS TO COME AND PAY A VISIT TO THE CITY. THERE'S NEVER A DULL MOMENT IN THIS FLICK. IT WOULD MAKE ANY SOUTHERNER PROUD TO WATCH THIS MOVIE.,924566400,,239,4.1063829787234045

351657,3,6301640594,Patrick Swayze basically plays a hillbilly cop who's brother gets killed by mobsters in Chicago.  So he comes to Chicago to investigate.  It is a pretty good action movie.  That also has a young Ben Stiller and Liam Neeson.  And features a mean bow and arrow.,1512172800,,259,4.565217391304348

351694,3,6301640594,"""Next of Kin"" is pretty much the standard vigilante movie. Only the actors were changed to protect Charles Bronson in ""Death Wish"" (1974) and Sylvester Stallone in ""First Blood"" (1982) from this overplayed formula movie.

Truman Gates' (Patrick Swayze) brother has a brand new truck and is selling wholesale cigarettes. He should be shot for that. Oh, he was. Evidently against the advice of his partner the brother decided to protect the cigarettes from hijackers with his life. On the other hand little Joey Rosselini (Adam Baldwin) is showing off and can not back down from the challenge.

Now Truman must identify the person whom his brother insulted and incarcerate him. You guest it; the rest of the kin which includes Blair (Liam Neeson) thought you were supposed to ""incinerate"" him. So the fun begins. Bang! Bang! Soot-um up.",1504137600,,834,4.9928057553956835

351930,5,6301640594,"A lot of people have no idea that there are ghosts up on Dagget's Ridge. I first saw em nearly 70 odd years ago. A friend Willy of mine did and he was arrested and violently assaulted by the police (well all but one fair police officer). There's rumor that a pair of brothers Briar and Gerald where murdered by Italian Americas for that very same reason. I never trusted a guido as far as I could throw a dilapidated tire. The fear of the supernatural is strong in people and it shows in this documentary/biopic hybrid. That's the kind of reaction to expect from the kind of people referred to in my neck of the woods as City Dwellers and Mouth Breathers by my friends and family (there's some crossover). We're from a place where William is a common name (although often abbreviated) and we're lacking unchanging and stable altitudes and landmasses. It's fairly hard for example to push a shopping cart where I'm from for more than 50 feet. Or to find a school where teachers are present. I suspect it's been like that for some time, but I digress.

This film has an authenticity I haven't really seen in other films before with perhaps the exception of Winter's Bone and coincidentally basically every other movie that Patrick Swayze has been in (not counting Waking Up in Reno and Tiger Warsaw). Despite my disgust at the racist word itself, Fred Crowther is riveting as ""Old Hillbilly"", Eric Bana's uncredited role as Snake (or Snakeman if you want to inaccurately follow IMDB) sets a tone that almost can't be matched, Al Neal's fearless performance where he breaks character to hang up the phone the ""Hillbilly Bartender"" tries to use to call the police (side note Jack Kandel was born in Chicago. I've been there brother and you can have it) while Briar and Truman decide physically on a course of action is reminiscent of a young Sidney Poitier. I can't overstate the familiarity of Jack's ease and these brothers problem solving.

Much like Steve McQueen's portrayals of the IRA's hunger strike in 1981, and the horrific (but misunderstood in my part of the country) slave trade in America, this film is directed by an Englishman (apparently that's not a bad thing anymore) who despite not being from Appalacia has apparently done his Bourbon soaked research and captured almost every part of life as we know it. Perhaps the only digressions is the idea that a man as amazing a Patrick Swayze (who plays the human protagonist Truman) would ever have been happy with Bettie Jean (who he did not steal from Briar) instead of Jessie, or in the general premise that Truman would have allowed anyone in his family to die in the first place.  But we need drama in a movie I expect to move things along.

Now I realize that younger fellas don't like people my age to be long winded so I suppose I'll leave it at that.

352131,5,6301640594,"A lot of you younger people might not have heard of this film. It came out in the eighties when Patrick Swayze was at the top of his game. The movie Road House did really well at the theater, also the video sales, and is even now available on the streaming networks. Road House (I believe) --was the kicker that jump started Swayze's career. Patrick could do no wrong. In the movie Ghost, he got to snuggle with Demi Moore! Arg! I had this HUGE CRUSH on her!! Sorry. I digress...this movie, Next of Kin, was surprisingly good. Swayze's character is a police officer that came from a poor county, he was born into a poor family. He and his brothers had nothing. But Patrick's character works hard and his endeavors made him one of the lucky ones. He made it out of holler and left poverty behind. But when Swayze's younger brother is murdered,  Swayze's older brother comes to the city to get an eye for an eye. But then the oldest brother crosses paths and runs afoul of the local mafia. Things go really bad. When the big city mafia try to push things, they don't realize whom they are messing with...when the word that the two brothers are fighting against a terrible bunch of hard core killers in search of the man that was responsible for the younger brothers death. Immediately after hearing the word of fighting makes it's way back home to all of the Kin from the ol' holler,  a small army of Kin rushes to protect Swayze: the uncle's and cousins, grandparents, nephews, and a whole town full of very angry friends of Swayze's kin load up and swear to serve vengeance....country style. The mafia hasn't a clue what is about to happen to them. Like the old song by Hank Williams Jr. says: a country boy can survive.",1456963200,4,1720,4.457142857142857

353050,4,6301640594,"I discovered this movie by accident around 90 or 91. it is an action/mob/""hillbilly"" movie. Stars include Patrick Swayze (looking so hot), Helen Hunt, Liam Neeson, Bill Paxton, Adam Baldwin and Ben Stiller in a small role. Swayze is a cop in Chicago in 1989 and his brother is killed. Swayze is from Appalachia (foothills of southeast mtns) and very soon his ""hillbilly"" relatives show up for retribution.
  I like it because this was Chicago in 1989. Dirty, crime ridden with a great deal of poverty. Most Appalachians would not be caught dead in Chicago! So thats a big stretch. As usual my husband and I ignore these bizarre plot points in an action movie.
  Liam Neeson is practically unrecognizable as a hillbilly brother doing a pretty good Appalachian accent. Not near as fast paced as todays action movies but if you like the stars and the plot - a great movie.",1390953600,,869,4.697368421052632

It was cool seeing Liam Neeson playing a Hillbilly and to see how far he has come now in his career as an actor. Patrick Swayze also does a fantastic job as usual. Ben Stiller has a role in this, not a funny one but a serious role and it is neat seeing him act serious, I think he did a good job.

Co-starring Liam Neeson(Taken, Taken 2) Oscar-winner Helen Hunt(As Good as it Gets, Mad About You) and Ben Stiller(Zoolander, Dodgeball), Next of Kin tells the story of Gates(Swayze), his older brother(Neeson) and their relatives from the backwoods of Kentucky, seeking revenge for the murder of Gates' little brother at the hands of the Chicago mafia.

From deep in the Appalachia country, Truman Gates (Swayze) emerges for the bright lights of Chicago where he becomes a police officer.  Tagging along is screw-up, younger brother Gerald (Paxton), whose southern naivety gets him in trouble, and ultimately killed by mobster Joey Rosselini (Baldwin).  Joined by his brother Briar (Neesom) in some sort of twisted Wyatt Earp tale, Truman melds his big city skills and country knowledge while seeking vengeance for Gerald.  If it weren't set in a city the size of Chicago, there is almost a little Hatfield & McCoy in there.  In fact, I would have enjoyed this film infinitesimally more if the brothers' surname were either Hatfield or McCoy.

While there isn't much subtlety to the film, there is a decent portrayal of the contrast between city and country life.  Even back country, Appalachian life, where opossum is not just road-kill, but hearty vittles.  The film's score accentuates the divide, with finely tuned pianos battling dulcimers and washboards for screen-time.  Equally juxtaposing is the actual scenery.  High rises versus hollers.

Ultimately a viewer has to decide if the showdown between city and country is worth the time.  Highly recommended, y'all.",1350518400,,1430,5.138528138528138

This movie features a first class cast, a twisted plot and a good storyline. The acting is very good and Helen Hunt, Patrick Swayze, and Liam Neeson lead the all-star cast.

I enjoyed this movie and I recommend it to you as worth seeing.",1345852800,,1226,4.361233480176211
353484,5,6301640594,"Back in the 80's action movies where all the rage, remember when everybody was seeing/talking about Die Hard, Predator, Lethal Weapon or the latest Rambo entry. Reenter those wonderful unforgettable days of ole for this piece of underrated southern fried vengeance and mayhem action flick starring mullet hero Patrick Swayze and a then largely unknown Liam Neeson, who sets the groundwork for his future metamorphosis from Oscar nominated actor to 21st century Charles Bronson, here.

Directed by John Irvin, a maverick of the underrated action movie with credits like the Dogs of War and the superior Schwarzenegger vehicle Raw Deal, Swayze stars as Truman Gates, a reformed hillbilly turned windy city cop. When mobsters kill his little brother (Bill Paxton), he finds himself torn between ""what he should have done and what has to be done."" So enter his estranged older brother, Briar (Neeson), the kind of Appalachian who keeps a severed deer's head in his fridge next to his beer. Briar comes to the big city looking for the men responsible and more than willing to stomp a few creeps to get some answers. Truman, unsuccessfully attempts to keep him on a leash, but soon finds himself drawn into the dark side of vengeance too.

Not nearly as giddy silly as the much loved Swayze starrer cult classic Road House. Still, Next of Kin offers plenty to recommend like an awesome showdown in a cemetery, amiable characters, funny cheesy dialogue, and a great role for cult character actor Michael J. Pollard as the proprietor of a flophouse who gets the film's single funniest line (""Hell, no. I'd shoot somebody"").

Having never looked better than on the new Blu-ray release with it's 1:85:1 high definition transfer, it easily replaces the poor quality budget pan & scan DVD from years ago. Featuring a stunning cast of actors who would continue to various levels of stardom, not just Neeson and Paxton, but also a never lovelier future Oscar Winner Helen Hunt, Adam Baldwin (Serenity) as the chief heavy, a young Ben Stiller as a mobster flunky and Ted Levine (""Monk"") .

Next of Kin is not as well known as many of the other actioners of it's day, but it is one of the best. As expected there are plot holes, inconsistencies and plenty of good old clichs, but it's also a lot of fun and an agreeable time waster. A perfect lazy Sunday afternoon movie.

353565,5,6301640594,"I have always been a fan of this movie. It's great from beginning to end! I remember having this film on laserdisc when it first came out, and last fall I bought the dvd for 5 bucks. This past Sunday I viewed the film on dvd and I have to say I wasn't really impressed with the picture quality. Last night I purchased the bluray for 10 bucks and decided to watch it again, and let me tell you the difference is day and night! The colours were vibrant and bright, it brought the movie back to life. The sound on the regular dvd is 2.0 digital but on the bluray its DTS surround and it was awesome. In watching the bluray, I saw some scenes I didn't notice on dvd.
If you are looking to upgrade, this bluray is highly recommended, not to mention an action packed film with some great family values that we don't see much of anymore!",1344902400,,830,4.161490683229814
353566,5,6301640594,This movie grabbed me from the outset.  I could relate to his character in more ways than one.  Having been raised in the hills of North Georgia and entering the Army becoming a Paratrooper with the 101st Airborne Division.  Afterwards becomimg a big city Detective with Atlanta Police Department.  During my background investigation for employment APD background investigators had to have the local Police Chief go with them before people would give up information on my background. Patrick Swayze and others brought this story to life on the screen.,1342742400,,551,5.157303370786517
353567,4,6301640594,"I really miss Patrick Swayze, so I enjoy watching his movies.  How I missed this one I'll never know because it was produced in 1989.  Anyway this story about Truman Gates, a transport from the Kentucky hill country made Chicago cop was pretty good.  His brother, Briar, played by Liam Neeson was definitely a standout.  Who knew he could pull off a ""mountain man"" with such finesse!  The scene where he wreaks havoc with the pinball machines at a mob run business was hilarious!  Helen Hunt as Truman's wife was also good but it seemed like an odd match having a country style cop and a violinist in the same household.  It seemed to work though.  It was a dark movie with a lot of suspenseful, hair raising, a bit violent, car chasing scenes, but I enjoyed watching the film.  I would see it again as with all of Patrick Swayze's films.",1339113600,,838,4.4605263157894735

353569,4,6301640594,"Next of Kin follows Truman Gates, a Chicago cop from Kentucky. One of his brothers is murdered by the nearly psychotic nephew of a local Mob boss during a truck hijacking. Long story short, Truman's older brother Briar (Liam Neeson) comes up to Chicago wanting mountain family style revenge. Truman does his best to keep his brother restrained and for the police to handle it. Ultimately, a disgruntled Truman resigns and joins his family in getting justice served their own way.

In addition to Swayze and Neeson, the movie also stars Adam Baldwin, Helen Hunt, and a young then-24 year old Ben Stiller. Liam Neeson as Briar was pretty good. Other than Swayze, Neeson gave a very good performance. Briar gave off an air of wanting to just let loose on the people he wanted to get back at but wanting to listen to his brother at the same. It was also interesting seeing Ben Stiller play a more serious straightforward character as the son of the local organized crime boss.

The DVD itself is pretty basic. There's no special features to speak of. Though in its defense, the DVD was released not too long after DVDs really started hitting the shelves in the late 90s and was not an uncommon sight at the time for no special features to be included.

It's a fairly decent action movie though it also deals with Truman and his family's interaction (most notably his older brother). Not an explosion after explosion Die-Hard kind of action movie, but a bit more subtle.

All in all, Next of Kin is definitely a Patrick Swayze movie worth seeing. It's too bad that this movie seems to be so underrated and forgotten. I actually had never heard of the movie myself until last year when I saw it in Wal-Mart. I've always liked Patrick Swayze so I decided to buy it.

353723,5,6301640594,"Great acting from Liam Neeson and Patrick Swayze.  Wish some who reviewed the movie had watched it more carefully. Gerald (Truman's brother) wasn't doing anything illegal, he worked for a company with vending machines who were targeted by the Chicago mob for takeover--he got caught in a takeover mob killing. And Truman's (Swayze) brother's name was Briar (so typically mountain)--not Blair. And a reviewer wondered how Briar (Neeson) knew Chicago so well since he had never been there--Briar clearly states at Gerald's funeral he HAS been to Chicago and didn't like it, he returned home to Ky.--so that's why he knew his way around town.  Both Neeson and Swayze do a great job in expressing the culture of the ""hills"" versus the Chicago life. Helen Hunt is good as Truman's (Swayze) wife. The scenes of the hills when Truman takes Gerald's body home for burial is so true to life, the snake bus, the relatives and their desire to settle things their way, the houses (and Briar's old RV-home), the deer head in the refrigerator and the scenes of the hill country--just exactly the way it is.

Truman has gone to Chicago to make himself a better life.  He's still a ""mountain boy"" at heart but his family back in the hills are as real as it gets.  Gerald, the younger brother, has followed him to Chicago to make some money to buy a coal truck and return back to Kentucky.  Also, for any who might know ""mountain music"", Truman, Gerald and Briar's mother is played by Jean Ritchie, one of the most famous and best of the traditional mountain dulcimer players and song writers in the business. It was a treat to see her in the role of Mom. This is a great movie, so very underrated, great acting, good story line, good paring of actors with intensity.  Swayze is great as usual, Neeson can't be beat, his accent is perfect as is his look for this movie.

I loved the response (as my subject line) Truman made when he was called to a seedy hotel to get a ""mountain boy"" involved in a murder to surrender--Truman knew Chicago as a Chicago cop--and he knew the mentality of the mountain culture--an eye for an eye and you settle your differences yourself. There were a number of great one-liners in this movie--some I particularly liked were Swayze's ""enticement"" to Helen Hunt for a little romp upstairs, ""do you believe in the hereafter, then you know what I'm here after"" and ""wanna play on my teetertotter""--too funny.

The music was great in this movie, a little culture and a lot of country.  Swayze again wrote a song especially for this movie--""Brothers"" sung by Swayze and Larry Gatlin.

Great movie and one I will watch over and over.",1210723200,16,2640,4.643776824034335

Each time something shows up that I just shake my head at.  For example the music is a mixture of old hill music with some classical type pieces thrown in.  It takes a few viewings but you wonder how this music came to be in a ""action"" movie.  The accents are wonderful.  West Virgina accents are done to perfection. The phone call to relatives in West Virgina telling them about the death of one of their own, is a gem. In very few words and set of the mouth you feel the pain, and anger of a family. The gathering of the klan in West Virgina has a quiet dignity to it.  The family loading up guns, bows, and snakes, then pausing to pick up the sandwitches that their wives have made is not funny, but moving.  Forget about Patrick Swayse, the real stars are supporting cast.  You see them and then shake you head at how far they have come as actors.

 Anyway.. about the snake bus being ""over the top"" mentioned in an earlier review.  That bus exists, it used to visit the Paintsville Apple Festival every year, and he used to bring it to my gradeschool regularly for education about the snakes.  Mind you the tanks were better situated than in the movie, and well taken care of. Most of the snakes in the real bus were quite venemous as well.  Regardless, the bus in the movie, bit for bit, is an exact replica of the old snake bus.

The guy traveling in a converted school bus full of snakes was a bit hard to swallow, and how Liam Neeson's character could find his way around Chicago, and never having been there, is a mystery to me. Yes, there are many bow hunters in Kentucky!!  They have a special time during deer hunting strictly for bow.  And, yes, they are good with them!

Probably not, as most people can't, and what a shame.  ""Next Of Kin"" is a fine portrayal of the ""Eastern Mountain Way"" as well as the love of family and the bond of brothers.
I enjoyed this movie greatly.  Although the plot has been somewhat rehashed many times the performances here stir emotion.  Especially Liam Neeson's.  If not for his performance in this movie I probably would have given it 4 stars, but he shines brightly here.  The loyalty and love of his character combined with the contempt and anger of his character, what a great performance.
When this movie first came out I didn't even know it.  I don't know how it fell off the radar screen before ever being noticed but it is cerainly worth a look.

353812,3,6301640594,"In terms of just pure plot, Next of Kin is -- in many ways -- a typical example of the unconventional cop vs. the mob film genre of the 1980s...However, if Next of Kin is ultimately a genre piece, its still a better-than-average example of the what the genre is capable of.  Certainly, its probably the only film ever made by Patrick Swayze that can legitimately be called underrated.
Plotwise, the film sounds almost like a parody.  Patrick Swayze is a former hillbilly from Appalacia Country who has left behind his rustic family to become a big city cop and to romance sophisticated music teacher Helen Hunt.  (Is there a reason why big city cops with simple backgrounds always seem to end up romancing music teacers in these films?)  Swayze's younger brother Bill Paxton also comes to the city, to pursue a life of petty crime that ends up getting him killed by mobster Adam Baldwin which leads to yet another Swayze brother coming down to the city, this one played by Liam Neeson.  As Neeson seeks revenge, Swayze is forced to return to his roots in order to avenge both his brother and protect his girlfriend.
Yet somehow, all of this works rather effectively on screen.  The film is directed by Englishman John Irvin who has made a rather unsung career out of bringing a stronger-than-usual sense of characterization to genre films (the best example being the war film Hamburger Hill).  Although Irvin's filming of the action scenes are a little pedestrian, he still has a strong visual sense and manages to vividly contrast the conflicting worlds of the country and the city.  The film's supporting cast is well chosen and both the heroes and the villians all come to life with a surprising amount of dignity.  At no point do any of the actors demean their roles by playing ...typical hillybillys or, for that matter, ...typical mobsters and that shows an unusual and admirable amount of integrity for a film of this sort.  Paxton isn't on screen long but remains, as always, a likeable presence and Adam Baldwin makes a compellingly understandable and hissable villian.  Michael J. Pollard shows up as a hillbilly and brings his trademark quirkiness to the proceedings while the role of the nerdy mob scion is played by Ben Stiller, of all people.  Its a little jarring to see Stiller show up on screen (especially playing an essentially villianous role) yet he gives a strong performance without resorting to do any standard Stiller bits.  Helen Hunt's role is ...typical but she's probably far warmer in this role than she's been in any of her prestige pictures.  Certainly, the best performance in the film is given by Liam Neeson who dominates the proceedings with the grim sincerity he brings to his quest for revenge.  This Irish actor also manages to perfectly capture the unique accent of the Appalacian region.  As an actor, Patrick Swayze has always been limited and he's always been better at projecting sincerity than complexity.  Luckily, his role in Next of Kin has been designed to require little more of him than sincerity and, if Next of Kin doesn't represent his best performance, its certainly his most likeable.
Next of Kin isn't a great film.  As stated before, the story is a tad bit too predictable and that's only made more obvious when the story is populated by a better-than-average cast and directed by a truly talented director.  However, this is a rare genre piece in which it is obvious that everyone involved actually put in their best efforts to make a worthwhile film and the results are both admirable and entertaining.",1019088000,66,3562,4.80983606557377
353813,4,6301640594,"In one of his best roles, Patrick Swayze stars as Truman Gates, a Chicago cop transplanted from his native Kentucky. Yes, this is a revenge flick, but the acting is so strong that you have to forgive the somewhat predictable plot.
The cast is stellar. Here's Ben Stiller as the son of a Mafia don in one of his first roles. Here's Helen Hunt as Swayze's wife (this is a nice touch--in many of these kind of films, the hero cop is a loner; having him married to somebody like Helen Hunt is a good move). Here's Liam Neeson in a relatively quiet role--but when he does speak, you can feel it straight up your spine, oh yes. And here's Bill Paxton as the ill-fated brother of Truman Gates, another rock solid performance. Also on hand is Michael Pollard as the guy behind the desk of a run-down hotel (another nice touch), and Ted Levine as a bad guy (maybe warming up for Silence of the Lambs?).
The presence of bluegrass in Chicago is also a unique element, and it works well. There're no wasted words here--when somebody says something, he darn well means what he says. Because of this, as well as the solid performances, the film is much, much stronger than it has any right to be.
But it definitely works, and it's fun to watch.",1005782400,5,1230,4.399122807017544
