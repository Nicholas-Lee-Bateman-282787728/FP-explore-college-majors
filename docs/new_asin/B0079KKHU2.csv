8512914,5,B0079KKHU2,There is no graphic sex or violence by today's standards. It's set in a small Yorkshire village and the people get into as many scrapes and scandals etc. as in the real world. Each of the characters can make you laugh or cry but if nothing else pleases you the '60's and '70's music is great.,1410307200,,292,4.232142857142857
