3913079,4,B002DUJ9NE,"I liked this story. If you are an animal lover
like me you will probably like it too. An older
lady and her cat pass away. The cat's ghost comes
back to help new owners of the lady's house. A
greedy bad guy wants to tear down an animal shelter.
Story is cool because it's about a community that
kicks back against land take overs. I don't care much for seances,
but everything else is great. Buy it!",1260230400,5,399,4.128205128205129
3913080,5,B002DUJ9NE,I first saw this in 2004 and have been waiting for the DVD ever since. I won't recap Matthew's review because it is complete. I will say I am glad this movie finally made it to DVD. I will be buying a copy. It is a family story with the highlight on animals and human courage and belief.,1253232000,4,287,3.9655172413793105
3913081,5,B002DUJ9NE,"This movie, ""Ghost Cat"" was very well done. It was featured on Animal Planet near Halloween time, a couple of years ago.
 I have been asking the studio to release it on DVD ever since.

 Ghost Cat stars a young Ellen Page, who already had quite the screen presence in this movie, before she hit it big in future movies.

 It is the story about a young girl (Page) who's Mom dies, and the girl and her Dad move to a new house in the town where her deceased Mom had grown up.

 While looking for a new house the Father and daughter see a charming house for sale. The house is owned by Mrs Ashboro, who lives there with her cat, Margaret. Mrs Ashboro points out that she doesnt want to sell the house, that her overzealous nephew, put the ""For Sale"" sign out without her permission.

 We later learn that the Nephew has an ulterior motive for wanting the house sold..namely the money that he would get from the sale.

  Mrs Ashboro is surprised when she sees the young girl (Page) petting her cat, Margaret, because Margaret isn't used to alot of visitors and doesnt do well with alot of folks.

  To make a long story short, Mrs Ashboro dies, and her cat Margaret dies shortly after...obviously of a broken heart.

  That's where the fun begins......Margaret, the caring soul that she is, comes back in spirit and helps the young girl and her friends to keep the house out of the hands of the greedy Nephew.

  Margaret saves the day, as cats so often do in movies and in real life.

  This is a charming movie that you will want to watch over and over again with your family members (two legged AND four legged).

  It is spooky, but not scary like a horror movie.

  It has just the right balance of fun, happiness, spookiness, and joy.

  I will be buying the DVD.

  I hope that you will too....it makes a great movie to watch every Halloween season with your family.",1251504000,35,1869,4.346938775510204

Page has magical acting abilities, she has a style all her own, and gives reality to all I've seen her in.  ""Ghost Cat"" (also called ""Mrs. Ashboro's Cat"") is a good family movie all can enjoy.  Page and her father move to a house in the country, where a kind woman and her beloved cat had just died.  The cat appears as a ghost to lead Ellen Page to something important that needs to be found.  The cat apparition scenes are not fake looking.  Not a scary movie, it is a movie based on love.  The cat in the movie is precious.",1428192000,,682,4.075187969924812

It's an Animal Planet movie so there are lots of animals besides the title cat. This is not a horror movie, far from it. Gois triumphs and the villains, who are not scary, are foiled.

Topics some may avoid with family: innocent romantic relationships, dealing with death of a family member/friend/pet (but nothing graphic).  It is not scary (my child gets scared easily and this was not scary).  It is fun and keeps interest.  The only thing I had to coach my kid on is the lack of the use of 'please' and 'thank you' throughout the movie - but the movie was not rude.",1413072000,,440,4.395061728395062

If you're looking for a film that you can watch with the kids on a Friday or Saturday evening, then rent this one. It's very cute, has several funny moments throughout, and will warm your heart. However, if you're a fan of horror flicks, then don't go near this one, for you will be disappointed.",1412899200,,516,4.319587628865979

3913356,5,B002DUJ9NE,"This is one cute little family movie. It is entirely appropriate for young audiences (no bad language, no real violence beyond people falling down or getting scratched!) but it is also done well enough to hold an adults attention. The ghostly bits are not terrifying  just mildly jolting enough so you know they are, in fact, ghostly bits - and they are unlikely to frighten even the most skittish viewer.

I won't go into the plot here as many people have already described it very well. I did note that several people commented on the cheesy love story between Kurt and Natalie. They were right  it really is a cheesy little love story and it is adorable. Ive gotten quite tired of our modern movies where everyone, young or old, has to strip off their clothes and fall onto whatever piece of furniture is available (or the floor, of course, if all else fails) in order to have a love scene  even if the love scene is totally unnecessary for the plotline. It was nice to see a good old-fashioned cheesy, 50s style love scene for once.

I agree with one reviewer who said the cat could have had a bigger part in the picture since she was, after all, the title character but who knows  they may have had trouble getting her full cooperation. Feline actors can be very hard to work with  the more you ask them to do, the more catnip they demand.

I admit to being hopelessly immature and out of touch when it comes to movies  I watch them strictly for escape and prefer happy endings no matter how improbable. If I want loss, tragedy, and death Ill read a newspaper or watch the news. This movie tells a good, wholesome little story, makes the bad guys really bad and the good guys really good, throws in a sweet bit of romance, and (Im sure this won't be a terribly big spoiler for anyone) ends well.",1407024000,14,1800,4.413897280966768

3913383,4,B002DUJ9NE,"On a whim we decided to stream this movie, simply because the idea of a ""ghost cat"" was intriguing. It's actually a television film that was made for Animal Planet, and appropriately there is a fairly large emphasis on the animals in the story--but not overly so. The animals don't talk or anything like that, they are portrayed in a more realistic fashion...with the exception of the ghost cat, of course! She tends to act like a feline Lassie, guiding people to important discoveries or emergencies.

The acting is decent, and even the animals do a good job. The actions of the ""bad guys"" do tend to be a bit overdone, but this just makes it easy to root for the good guys, who are actually pretty likable despite the fact that some things (romances, in particular) are rather easy to predict. The casting was done well; everyone fit into their roles nicely with the exception of Kurt (Shawn Roberts), who looked quite a bit too old for the part he was playing. This made the slowly budding romance between him and Natalie a bit weird, since she was said to be in 9th grade, but Kurt looked early 20's--despite the fact that he was supposedly only in 11th grade. (In reality the actors only have 3 years separating them, but the age difference looked far larger on screen.) This is really the only flaw I can find to mention, and with a bit of imagination you can fairly easily overlook it.

There's no inappropriate content, and the language is mild as well. There were a few instances of ""Oh my God!"", but I can't remember anything else that might be offensive.

Animal lovers will obviously enjoy the story the most, but I'd be willing to bet that alot of kids would probably like it, too. Those who aren't animal lovers will likely scoff at it, and admittedly it's not very realistic...however, the idea of a ""ghost cat"" is amusing and I found it to be a decent way to spend 90 minutes of the evening. Even our dog got a kick out of the movie, with all the different animal noises heard at various times! :)",1400716800,7,2013,4.479564032697548

3913385,3,B002DUJ9NE,"Like so many of these sweet movies the characters are one dimensional. Villains are bad; everyone else are saintly. And the cat looked sickly, which I suppose makes sense, but is hard for a cat lover to watch. And then with it in the title, you'd think we'd get to know 'Margaret' a bit better. But all is so superficial and there are several glitches in the plot that make it hard to accept. A few threads are left dangling.... But it is a sweet little movie with a happy ending. Even for magical realism this isn't quite realistic enough for my tastes. Maybe a tad heavy on the sugar, needed a bit more lemon.",1399420800,,611,4.321739130434783

3913411,5,B002DUJ9NE,"I love cats, and I love ghost stories - so when I found this movie, which seemed to have both (and was free for Amazon Prime members) I was very excited. Knowing it was a made-for-TV movie, I was a bit worried about the quality, although I really didn't need to be.

It's a great story with lots of cute animals and a little (very sweet-not raunchy) romance. I watched it by myself first, but I would feel completely comfortable letting my kids watch this, and they're still pretty small - all except for the seance scene, but even that could be okay with some careful explanation of why you really don't want to mess with that stuff.

This movie exceeded my expectations (I LOVED the opening scenes showing the relationship between the little ""old"" lady and her cat), and I highly recommend it for animal lovers and for those who like their ""scary"" stories to be a little less scary and much less gory/violent.",1393027200,,911,4.515151515151516

3913413,4,B002DUJ9NE,"I enjoyed it. I think Ellen Page is cute and funny, with vast potential as an actress. The storyline was simple and the entire movie would have benefited greatly if the script had followed the book more closely, but for what it is, it's a movie worth watching. One major thing I would done is have the main 'bad guy' explain at some point, even if it were just out loud to himself, that he needs 200,000 dollars in order to fix everything at the bank back to normal so he wouldn't be caught. The way the movie portrays it, you'd think he gave the house away and only needs 50,000 dollars. It would have made more sense if it had shown him cash a 150k check and perhaps mutter, ""Still 50,000 short..."" or something similar. That is, of course, just my opinion. That point just seemed a tad muddled. I still think it was a good movie, it wasn't 'great', but it was definitely worth a watch.",1390176000,,888,4.291666666666667
