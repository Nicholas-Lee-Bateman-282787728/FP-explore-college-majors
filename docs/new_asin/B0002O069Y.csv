This movie isn't as good as the series, but I still enjoy it.  Dr. Michaela Quinn, Sully, Brian, & Katie travel to Boston to see Colleen graduate from college.",1144886400,2,427,4.5064935064935066

I am a huge Dr. Quinn fan, so seeing the cast back together to make a final movie was wonderful. Seeing Katie, Dr. Quinn and Byron Sully's child, older is great, and seeing Brian almost a man was moving.

This film doesn't take place in Colorado Springs, instead, it takes place in Boston, where Dr. Michaela Quinn's mother has taken deathly ill. The family (except Mathew) head out by train to Boston. When they arrive, they head directly to Dr. Quinn's mother in a hospital.

It ends up that Dr. Quinn's motehr, Elizabeth Quinn needs a serious experimental surgery. Everyone debates if she should get the surgery or not. Brian, on the other hand, tries to get a job at a newspaper to show the family how talented and grown up he is. While Colleen is married to Andrew and is going to Harvard Medical school and wants the top grade in her class, but is afraid to excell becuase she is a girl.

Keeping in mind that this film was done AFTER the TV series had been cancelled, and it was done several years after Joe Lando (Sully) cut his hair and is wearing a terrible wig, this film shows the heart and soul of the Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman series, and finishes with a heartfelt goodbye for others like me who wanted to see how the characters were doing after the series ended.

However-I rated it only 4 stars because I wanted to have more closure for the other characters, such as Grace and Robert E. In the final episode of Season 6, Grace tells the town she is pregnant. Where is their child now?? What sex was it!? And what about Mathew, is he married? And what about Dorothy? Did she end up becoming a couple with Cloud Dancing?

This movie forgets about the other townsfolk, but it gives closure about the Quinn-Sully family. I also reccomend the film, Revolutions, which is done much better than this, and was also a film after the series.
**UPDATE: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY PURCHASING AN EXPENSIVE VHS COPY-BOTH DR. QUINN MOVIES ARE COMMING OUT ON DVD THIS SUMMER (2006) BEING RELEASED BY A&E!!!**",1117756800,10,2132,4.484536082474227
8029798,5,B0002O069Y,"I loved the televsion series when it was on the air and was shocked when they took it off. I loved the movie too but, I did notice two huge differences though. Andrew's parents in the show weren't alive and in the movie they were. Andrew was working with his uncle and not his father in the tv show. Where was Matthew? (Chad Allen) You think he would have been in it too. Please don't get me wrong, I loved Dr Quinn when it was on the air and still do, but I couldn't help notice those two things.

The movie was great other than those two things.",1112486400,2,547,4.064814814814815
