8289978,3,B001CUBBM8,"""Ancient Mystery Movers"" explores how long-ago civilizations moved heavy stone statues that they created.  For example, about 900 up to 80-ton stone statues on Easter Island were moved up to 9 miles during the period 1000 A.D. until 1500 A.D.  The most successful experiment was using a ""sled"" over logs greased with a local substance.

Similarly, near Vera Cruz, Mexico, pre-Mayan humans moved 9' heads weighing 20 tons between 400 B.C.-1,500 B.C. through jungles.  Estimates, based on scaled-down experiments, are than about 1,000 were required using hemp ropes (the material is local and readily available) for about ten mile to water, then floating the heads close to their final locations.",1227312000,,694,5.281818181818182
