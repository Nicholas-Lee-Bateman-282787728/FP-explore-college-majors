5022425,5,B006W95BSO,"I saw this movie long, long ago and was quite impressed.  I searched diligently, but I never could find a VHS copy; later, I could not find a DVD or Blu-ray, either.  Now, finally, it is available!  And the quality of the picture and sound are superb.  I could not be more pleased with this purchase.",1388448000,3,300,4.303571428571429

5022427,4,B006W95BSO,"I first saw this movie decades ago with my Mom. We were both struck by the Gothic story line and the mysterious villain played by Aldo Ray. Its reviews claim that it is a ""flawed western"". I disagree. It is a treat, and, I am glad to see it is finally out in some format.",1381449600,2,271,3.9454545454545453
5022428,3,B006W95BSO,"A small town is victimized by a vicious and violent gunman played by Aldo Ray. Henry Fonda plays a sheriff trying to hold the town together when this criminal comes back.

5022429,4,B006W95BSO,"An enjoyable western certainly has a different story line to your normal westerns
but Henry Fonda is an excellent actor i enjoyed watching this movie.",1376352000,2,150,5.04
5022430,3,B006W95BSO,"This movie supports an all star cast and a its different kind of western to be sure. The acting, production, and directing is very good. The only problem I had with this movie is it is NOT REMASTERED. The movie has a dark tint through out and is also grainy. If it was truely remastered, I would have give it a 5 star rate......If you like westerns with a different twist,its worth having if you can get for the right price......support your favorite artists.........",1342396800,10,467,4.571428571428571

8505445,3,B006W95BSO,Brutal film...and somewhat unbelievable ..with some terrible writing...especially for some of the secondary characters in the movie...but if you like Henry Fonda...you will want to see what he does here.,1516060800,,203,5.8

8505447,5,B006W95BSO,"The is the darkest, grimmest western  I've ever seen.  There is no hero and nobody lives happily ever after.  It is also a gripping tale you won't forget.  If the old west was really like this, I'm glad my ancestors stayed in New England.

PS:  The E.L. Doctorow novel upon which the film is based is way, way darker and grimmer!!!",1458000000,2,331,4.344262295081967

8505449,1,B006W95BSO,"Welcome to Hard Times may be the worst western ever filmed, considering the talented actors who wasted their time and skills on this ridiculous and predictable film. Heres just a partial list of some of the excellent actors who are completely wasted along with their better performance in a western - Warren Oates (The Wild Bunch), Royal Dano (Johnny Guitar), Paul Fix (The Rifleman TV series),  Denver Pyle (The Alamo), Edgar Buchanan (Judge Roy Bean), Lon Chaney Jr. (High Noon).

The blame must go to Burt Kennedy, whose heavy-handed script and direction are an embarrassment. Kennedy (1922-2001) specialized in B westerns (The War Wagon, Support Your Local Sheriff) but did much better on TV (the Lawman, How the West Was Won, The Alamo: 13 Days to Glory). In fact his TV background is evident in every shot.",1440460800,,812,4.91970802919708
