4065496,5,B0033U39RU,"This amazing DVD is like having a workshop right in your own home.  Susan combines her talent to create extraordinary watercolor paintings with her gift as a teacher to show you how to be successful with your work.  Nothing is left out.  From the materials she uses to the footnotes at the end, she demonstrates step-by-step her methods for acheieving beautiful results.  As she points out and analyzes areas of the study or her painting, a detailed image of that area is shown up in the corner.  It's like peering over the artist's shoulder.  Following this DVD will give you the confidence to paint with watercolors knowing you now have all the tools necessary to create a beautiful painting. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.",1272585600,5,733,4.6434108527131785
4065497,5,B0033U39RU,"Susan's latest DVD painting Watercolor my way is the best DVD I have seen from the many DVD's I have.
You will follow along seeing how to stretch paper to a finished painting .How a white subject be full of color yet still read white,the use of warm colors and cool colors giving the subject form/shape. Understanding the amount of water to use the degree of wetness to achieve seamless blending of hues, the control of this priming method is empowering , as you have the control as what is believed to be a difficult medium, I have gained that control.

Susan shows and explains how and why her method works, the yellow under painting that glows through and gives the painting body, how to mix and read colors to achieve a natural appearance, observation is one of her key elements .Pointing out the different planes on a subject where it comes forward or pushed back be it a bowl, petal or background . To work on a painting or background in section without demarcation lines,this is another powerful technique.

When the leaves are painted you can almost feel the undulations .Using transparent and semi/transparent pigments in layers and not creating mud, giving your work a rich luminous glow.
With this method watercolor is not the poor relation as previously thought, you can achieve a richness of color that can compare to other mediums in my view.

Painting with such depth of color in watercolor will stands up to other medium hung up in Art show or Gallery .
I have only touched briefly on this amazing work that Susan demonstrates extensively and explains  so eloquently  along the way.

I have viewed it many times or listen to it as I paint, that I'm still learning the many layers of information to this method, I may wear the DVD out. I feel privileged to be able to see and learn what Susan has developed and taken years to learn and sharing. A few of my art buddy,s that has just bought the DVD stated ...worth every cent ...word of mouth is a powerful thing.
Thank you Susan

4065498,5,B0033U39RU,"This is THE BEST watercolor video I have ever watched! It's long, and packed with information.  She teaches you how to paint four different subjects: shiny, reflective surfaces (porcelin and gold), delicate flowers, leaves, and wood grain.  Susan pours her heart and soul into her teaching, so that you get as much out of it as you possibly can.  She covers everything from her pallette, stretching paper, other useful supplies and tricks that she's learned over the years, her 'priming' method of painting, color theory, warm and cool colors, painting shadows, reflected colors, backgrounds, everything. I've watched  this video a half a dozen  times and am still learning new things -- there's so much to take in.  If I could only buy ONE video, it would be this one!  Also of note, is the superb filming and editing that is so apparent in this DVD, setting it far and above other instructional DVD's.  This one clearly stands in a class of its' own.",1272326400,7,952,4.7975460122699385
4065499,5,B0033U39RU,"I didn't think it could get better after Susan Harrison-Tustain's two other DVDs. But in
this new DVD 'Painting Watercolor My Way' she gives all. You can follow her thought
process, you don't only see how she paints - she explains all in full detail, why she
does this or that.

Susan has a magical palette of colours - she shares all she has learnt over so many
years. You only have to follow this,
carefully using her methods, and you are able to create beautifully artwork
like she does. Her paintings do glow and you can acchieve this, too.

I especially liked that important messages
about her painting method were also able to be seen in written form, so I really didn't
miss anything.

She shows how she stretches paper, explains her colours, shows her brushes. If you ever wanted to know
how to paint porcelain or a beautiful rose or the texture of a shiny wood table in a still
life then this DVD is a ""Must Have"". And the bonus is that you can apply all what you
learn to other subjects that you want to paint. A fabulous DVD.",1267833600,17,1036,4.357512953367876
4065500,5,B0033U39RU,"Although the subject looks quite simple, in truth as many watercolorists know, white can be a very tricky color to keep, and a bear to get back into a painting.  Also creating the glow of the inside of the cup, or the light through the petals, and even the reflection on the table top is no easy feat.  With this DVD you can, and you can apply these learnings to so many other subjects!  Susan holds back nothing, sharing all of her learnings and techniques in this DVD.  She explains steps thoroughly and with fore-thought as to what your questions might be.  It is wonderful to have the availability of pausing and rewinding (or even stopping and returning after a step has dried) to review a particular technique over again. With Susan's encouragement throughout the DVD, you too will feel as if she is talking directly to you and you are having a 1:1 session with a master.  It seems almost unfair for us to learn what has taken her years of experimentation, but I am sure thankful we can have such a head start!  As she says, ""Enjoy the journey!""  And Happy Painting!",1263945600,9,1072,4.489690721649485
8388056,5,B0033U39RU,"I don't write many reviews, but this is a great DVD. I have worked with oil paints, and over glaze porcelain paints for many years. I love realism and detail. When I took art classes in high school and college, abstract art was all the rage. It is just not my thing. I did learn to draw from art classes, but I learned more about painting from books and DVDs than I ever did from art classes. I was taught absolutely nothing about under painting and glazing, or about fat over lean, etc. I got so frustrated with being told so frequently ""try to be more abstract"". If I had been born with a silver spoon in my mouth, and didn't have to work for a living, I would have gone to a traditional atelier type of art school. I am just beginning to work with watercolors. This DVD gives thorough instruction in glazing, and detail. I think a lot of these techniques would be applicable to oil painting also. If you like a much looser style of watercolor, this DVD would not be for you. However, if you like realism, and detail, this DVD gives excellent training. I intend to purchase Mrs. Harrison-Tustain's other DVD's also.",1497916800,,1117,4.400966183574879
8388057,5,B0033U39RU,"These movies were very helpful. As a learning water colorist she gave good, clear instruction and helpful tips. Portraits are tricky and my paintings are improving with this type instruction",1418342400,,190,5.366666666666666
8388058,5,B0033U39RU,"I have searched and searched for high quality DVDs aimed at teaching Watercolor Realism.  While there are many good ones on the market, this DVD is absolutely wonderful!  Susan Harrison-Tustain is an internationally acclaimed artist from New Zealand who creates the most glowing, realistic paintings.  I have also come to learn that she is a best selling author of a book on watercolor and has been published many, many times.  I have watched this one about 5 times as there is so much instruction found here! You will feel as if you are sitting next to Susan in her art studio. You can either follow along or watch and pause as I have done.  I had ""dabbled"" in watercolor with typical results until I found this DVD, which takes you from beginning to end on the painting shown in the cover.  However, even if you don't want to duplicate this exact painting, the DVD is expertly designed to teach you how to create a beautiful rendering of several surfaces - from shiny wood to delicate rose petals - even how to create realistic looking ""painted on"" porcelain!  Susan's step by step, highly detailed instructions are presented in such a friendly manner, you do not feel ""talked to"" rather, ""talked with"".  This particular DVD has allowed me to leap ahead by years in my painting abilities.  She is also working on another video as I have come to understand called Watercolor Masterclass, the first installment of a series with new lessons such as ""crucial elements of a painting"", how to master leaves and vibrant greens - all challenging subjects!  That will be another must have - I can't wait for its release.  I have also learned that Susan has sold over 25,000 DVDs worldwide.  I am not surprised!  You will not be disappointed with this or any of her DVD's!",1403740800,,1764,4.669902912621359
8388059,5,B0033U39RU,"This DVD set will benefit even experienced watercolor artists, I think, as well as beginners in watercolor. The title really fits: ""Watercolor My Way,"" as this truly is a highly personal, unique approach, and Susan Harrison-Tustain is very sincere in explaining her views and why she does everything, step-by-step. The camerawork is good and you are literally following along with her as she progresses through the painting.

The painting project is of an impossibly sophisticated subject - a closeup of a pale rose, with hues of white, pink, blue, etc. and all the translucency implied in its multiple fragile layers as the light shines through - as part of a still life setup. A tough assignment, no matter what your skill level. But she takes us through the varied steps and layers of the entire picture, and even shows some examples of things that ""can go wrong"", and how to fix them!

She does several clear washes throughout the painting process, to ""prep"" the painting surface, causing the paint to spread in a controlled way, as it is applied. And sometimes will do a clear wash over an already-painted area to soften it, for the more detailed work which will yet be done. She also points out the power of the pale wash, something that is not always considered in watercolor teaching. Her patience, light touch, and thoughtful advice as to what the outcome may be, is I think the key to success for a watercolorist who would like to achieve great detail and realism in their work specifically the sense of a living, fleeting, fluid organic form (which is the quality of flowers).

Susan is extremely patient and deliberate, both in her watercolor work and in explaining the process to us. Her guidance in these DVDs is very detailed and easy for the viewer to understand. Small graphic video signs are displayed at intervals which will announce what is going on, in case it is not understood immediately by the viewer - ""Clear wash"" (1st or 2nd), time elapse signs, etc.

She explains thoroughly how she has arrived at the various multi-colored ""white"" areas in the composition, and discusses how we see a variety of colors that compose our perception of ""white"", pointing out the different values and hues, etc. All is done in a very relaxed manner, as she is forever mixing, mixing each color, and it seems decisions are made as she goes, for our benefit. She gives a lot of suggestions for us to think about, regarding use of color, recognizing tones, and identifying and protecting the pure highlighted edges and areas.

Susan works with some materials that are known to be rather expensive, and offers mini-sets marketed with her name and endorsement. It is a fact that although pricey, they are among the finest on the market and are professional-level quality. (DaVinci brushes and Schminke watercolor paints). But it is not required to use those brands specifically, and she does mention that. (As for me, I am a Winsor Newton loyalist, but I once had an instructor who advised the class that Schminke is far superior to WN, as it releases much more concentrated color). The type of paper used is most important, and she is correct to recommend Arches, again pricey, but will always deliver superior results, even if you are a beginner.

I am an advanced watercolor painter, but when I have trouble, things can weirdly get out of hand sometimes. I was surprised to find that you can always learn several new things (in from Susan's approach and narration) and found plenty that will help me improve as an artist.  I have taken a lot of classes and read many books over the years, but have never had the fundamentals - and some advanced approaches - pointed out in such a clear, concise way as is shown and explained in these DVDs.

I will start my next watercolor painting with a fresh and different approach; it is all about having a familiar, sensual affinity with the relationship of watercolor paint, paper and the water, which these DVDs point out very well.

There are a also a few short ""Garden Break"" segments, which are quite informative about different flowers and plants; they are a great relaxing break from the intensity of the continuing demonstration. The set is about 5 hours long, and the most beneficial thing to do is pay close attention, even if it seems tedious and longish at times. The lessons learned are a big pay-off, and this really is like a one-on-one tutored class. Susan is telling all, and informs how we perceive visually, it does not only involve technique. These are points, and lessons, that will stay in the mind and continue to help and inspire, long after the DVDs are finished, for the first of surely many viewings.",1402790400,3,4672,4.758024691358025
8388060,5,B0033U39RU,"Susan is an awesome teacher.  She shares her skills and thoughts so you can really understand them..

I am new to watercolor....and find her methods  very encouraging and thoughtful.",1393545600,,182,5.206896551724138
8388061,5,B0033U39RU,A well organized DVD that takes you step by step in achieving realism in watercolor. The techniques are more precise than I imagined but I feel like I could attain this level of painting with Susan's excellent teaching methods.,1367712000,,227,4.846153846153846
8388062,5,B0033U39RU,She starts you out from the very first step of soaking your paper.  She doesn't miss a thing. I learned a lot.,1357689600,,110,4.0
8388063,3,B0033U39RU,I would have given this 5 stars except that the second disk makes a noise in the background and is distracting from from her lesson.  If you wish to purchase this listen to your second disk all the way through first to make sure it is not defective.,1316995200,2,249,4.1875
8388064,5,B0033U39RU,"Susan takes you step by step through a project which for me, was very helpful. I love her style and feel that with her videos it is like having her right here in my studio. Great investment in my opinion!",1280361600,2,204,4.125
8388065,5,B0033U39RU,"This instructional video is absolutely a must have for newer artists like myself, and I know that more distinguished artists will also benefit from Susan's methodology.  She breaks down the steps of painting a beautiful porcelain teacup and rose, and makes some of those more challenging concepts easy to grasp, such as painting reflection, or making a gold rim on a porcelain cup look shiny.  Painting white on white can be daunting, yet I was so pleasantly surprised by how easy it is to follow her guidance.  I'll review this over and over again, so that I can perfect this technique.  I recommend this as a great buy for any water color artist!  Also, one of the other benefits is that Susan shows you how you can mix various pigments with a simple pallet, so you don't need 50 tubes of paint, you can actually achieve what you need for all colors of the spectrum with significantly less - Thank you Susan, for showing me your way of paintingl  I will definitely refer back to this dvd over and over again as I continue to learn the techniques that make your paintings look so real!",1273881600,3,1086,4.543589743589743
