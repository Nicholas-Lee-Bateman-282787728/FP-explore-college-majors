8574680,4,B00BWBCMFC,VERY GOOD,1426896000,,9,4.0
8574681,5,B00BWBCMFC,"I saw this movie when it was first released and later rented it on video. The DVD should have come out two decades ago.  Excellent in every way, but I won't spoil it by revealing anything.  I just hope the low price for the MVP and the high one for the DVD is not foreshadowing things to come.  I want a physical CD or DVD of something, not an electronic transfer to a computer.",1418515200,,378,4.081081081081081
8574682,5,B00BWBCMFC,"There are some drawbacks to this item, ""Woman of Straw"" (1964) directed by Basil Dearden and starring Sean Connery and Gina Lollobrigida that make approx. $40.00 asking price for this seem hefty but manageable, if you like to know your money is being spent well.  There are some imperfections of the print used to make the transfer, and Dearden, clearly skating in Hitchcock territory, pales in comparison, but he is pretty thorough, perhaps too.  He was killed in a car crash, but he was very British.  He directed the notorious ""Sapphire""  in 1959 and two years later made the controversial and ground-breaking film about homosexuality ""Victim"" in 1961 starring Dirk Bogarde in a daring role.  ""Woman of Straw"" is quite good, everything disposed of orderly, but the film does not seem to have right savoir faire necessary to put a signature style into place, perhaps as Dirk Bogarde said of him he needed ""the right atmosphere"" to be a top director.  After this he did the agreeable spy film, ""Masquerade"" starring Cliff Robertson and the big spectacle ""Khartoum.""  There are plenty of ways to lose more money than to pay for Colecao CultClassic edition which has a photo gallery, but other extras are in Portuguese(?).  It is presented in NTSC Widescreen and Eastmancolor. Audio is English as the film was made.  An excellent mystery by a fine craftsman.  Literate screenplay by Robert Muller and Stanley Mann based on a novel by Catherine Arley.  Top-notch performances, especially Miss Brigida and Ralph Richardson.  Works like a jewel.  Should be made more accessible.",1410480000,,1574,5.007692307692308
8574683,1,B00BWBCMFC,"Horrible  video and sound quality recording for a great movie. I feel it is a scam to pay almost $40 for this DVD.
I had to play it in three different DVD players to conclude it was the DVD and not the players the skipping sound and picture during the first 5 minutes of the movie. The worst VHS tape could have better quality. I was taken buying this DVD.",1404864000,,356,4.085714285714285
8574684,5,B00BWBCMFC,"Yes, Sean Connery didn't start out playing handsome leading men.  He also had a small part in an updated Tarzan film with Gordon Scott and Connery was a bad guy in that one, too.  It goes to the point that he can play a wide range of characters and carry them off convincingly.  Gina Lollobrigida was one of the sex goddesses of the 1960s and also a great actress.  She could play dramatic roles with style and romantic comedies, too.  If you do not have ""Come September"" in your dvd library,  consider it a ""must have.""  As an impressionable teenager from that time era, I enjoyed watching the battle of the sexes on the big screen.  This surely was a time when women knew how to look like women and men were definitely men!  This version does have some small flaws, such as a jumpiness to some of the scenes, but frankly, it was well worth the money.  The color is vibrant and with no sound track to distract you from the plot, the intensity as the plot builds to the climax is thrilling.  Well directed!  Snap it up!  I insist!",1403222400,,1030,4.329842931937173
8574685,2,B00BWBCMFC,"Its a great movie. However poor quality transfer of picture.
  That's all I can say. this movie deserves better than that.",1394841600,,122,4.761904761904762
8574686,5,B00BWBCMFC,"I bought 2 VHS versions of this film and they were horrible.  This crytal clear DVD version with a perfect soundtrack is a dream come true for lovers of this film.

This plot of this film is a gem of intrigue and deceit. Sean Connery's character is perfectly evil and he is finally caught in his own web.  Ralph Richardson's performance is masterful.  Gina Lollabrigita is wonderful as the somewhat ambivalent nurse/wife.  Greed, murder, and lust are the main thematic elements of the plot and I found the film somewhat Shakespearean in scope

It is worth the price.",1388016000,,566,4.724489795918367
8574687,4,B00BWBCMFC,"I have seen WOMAN OF STRAW several times, and have always enjoyed this elegant thriller by Basil Dearden.  The production values are outstanding: screenplay, cinematography, art direction, musical score. I suppose most viewers will be interested in seeing young Sean Connery in a non-James Bond role, but for me the film's real attractions are Gina Lollobrigida and Ralph Richardson, both excellent in their respective roles. Several of Lollobrigida's scenes capture her beauty and inner warmth (the Maiorca sequences, for instance) in an unforgettable way. Dressed by Dior, the lovely Italian walks with the majesty of a queen. How different from the awful, so-called top models we see today! The actress also delivers a powerful performance in her more dramatic moments towards the end of the film.  Her portrayal is totally convincing. Richardson does his usual superb job as a cold, egotistical man transformed by the power of love. A not-to-be-missed film if you are a fan of these wonderful actors.",1373241600,6,1004,5.26875
8574688,4,B00BWBCMFC,"What a movie find.  I would think this did well at the box office at its time, being Sean Connery in the midst of his James Bond phenomenon. It is rather phenomenal now.  Plus, this same year, 1964, Alfred Hitchcock's ""Marnie"" was released with Connery and Tippi Hedren, et al.  Both of these are movie gems on their own and a bit unusual for the pairings and other aspects, now and then.  Despite the novelty aspect, both are strong vehicles with top production values and casts.  I personally prefer Connery in these wonderful non-Bond vehicles. And Gina Loll... is exceptional here, with the emphasis on her acting ability which some understandably might not be aware that she possessed.  Typically, she is better known for parts which feature her tremendous sex appeal.  There is a natural comparison made with Sophia Loren; however, based on this performance alone, to me, her actual acting skill is superior, though Loren surpassed her at the box office.  She indeed gives a very measured and effective performance here. Of course, Ralph Richardson is one of those classical actors whose very name is equated with a fine portrayal this time and every time. Fans of various interests can now elate with the DVD release, finally, of this rather rarely known movie treat, but definitely with hope that the Amazon price will go down.",1372723200,9,1335,4.876106194690266
