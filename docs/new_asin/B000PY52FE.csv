2828830,2,B000PY52FE,Very poorly done.  We all know that nasa is a fraud these days.  Doing anything to get another piece of the American pie.  It doesn't matter if they hide ufo's anyway.  They are just demons messing with people.  See Missler's Return of the Nephilim on youtube if you really want to know what ufo's are and what they are doing.,1499731200,,326,4.366666666666666
2828831,1,B000PY52FE,Documented and recorded audio of Russian Cosmonauts speaking in English?  And it's proof?  You lost me at Russian Astronauts (AS PROOF) speaking to mission control in English.  This is absolute garbage for tinfoil hat people in Louisiana.  Learn some Russian.  Expand your world...  And delete this.,1497571200,,299,5.391304347826087
2828832,5,B000PY52FE,"Wow. This shows you how NASA totally tried to hide what it's cameras were shooting out in space. Which really opens up a lot of new questions.

The film / photography isn't the best, but the author shows you how NASA themselves intentionally blurs and adds static masks to degrade their own images from their cameras in space. What are they trying to hide? Why even do this?

This will open your eyes to how corrupt Nasa is.",1496275200,,424,4.423076923076923
2828833,3,B000PY52FE,Some very careful film editing went into this work. Revealing.,1452297600,,62,5.3
2828834,5,B000PY52FE,"This is a 2-disc set. Disc 1 is great. Here are some interesting facts: NASA added 4 layers of visual noise to all nighttime film footage shot from the space shuttles and ISS; i.e. one layer of white noise, and 3 layers of alternating color (as demonstrated in this film). Thus, all night time film footage looks terrible. Why does NASA do this? To prevent the public and the scientific community from seeing what NASA does not understand, and from asking questions NASA can't answer. Part of the problem is religion. The other is that NASA has an agenda which is to kill the scientific, exploratory aspect of the US space program, and turn it into a commercial venture to be enjoyed by the space tourism industry and private profiteers. Your taxes dollars used not to further science, but to make rich people even richer. Discoveries indicating there is life other than on Earth, may lead to demands that NASA spend money investigating. NASA does not want that to happen.  You don't add 4 layers of visual noise to hide something that does not exist and NASA is hiding evidence of anomalous objects engaging in anomalous behaviors, i.e. evidence of extraterrestrial alien life.  Part 1 of this 2-DVD set, explains how NASA censors this footage, then it presents nighttime footage from 5 shuttle missions which show, within all the noise, these structures engaging in behaviors that cannot be attributed to space junk, ice-crystals or shooting stars. The narrator does not try to tell you what these structures are, he merely shows you NASA footage and lets you be your own judge. Although not part of this DVD set, there is now film footage shot from almost a dozen shuttle missions showing these anomalous structures engaging in anomalous behaviors. NASA is a government organization. Governments lie. NASA has been lying about these discoveries since the 1960s. What these structures are, nobody knows, and that's because NASA does not want you to know about them.",1335398400,,1967,4.903903903903904
2828835,4,B000PY52FE,"First, be aware of what you are getting here. These are home-grown DVR-Rs by amateur astronomer and aircraft enthusiast Jeff Chandeller (now deceased). I think people over-emphasize the differences between a ""professional"" and an ""amateur"" to the point that it sounds like nothing an amateur can say is valid, and that is a fallacy. Amateurs can be very well informed, and very well educated. What makes them ""amateur"" is that they are not employed in the field with which they are knowledgeable, and that fact may not have any bearing on their credibility at all.

Jeff Chandeller seemed to have an extraordinary amount of insight in the operations of NASA and space missions. I am not in any position to confirm or deny his various claims, but what he presented in his videos is clear, demonstrable, logical, and believable. For example, I was impressed with his presentation of how NASA applies static masks to exterior night-time views in order to hide details. He didn't just claim it, he gave us examples. And he showed exactly which desk is responsible for this. To Jeff Chandeller there could be no reason for this mask except to hide ""anomalies"" that NASA does not want the public to see. In my mind, there could be some greater reasons of national security, not *necessarily* anything that could be extra-terrestrial in nature, but orbital phenomena that is either of a top secret nature -- either produced by our own government or another's.

But Jeff Chandeller's entire documentary features real NASA footage. Yes, you have to cope with the cheesy off-the-shelf licensed background music that sounds a little like 70's porno, and really badly mixed sound narration of Chandeller's own voice, but his clips are raw and that's what it's all about. His explanation of what we are seeing helps to place things in context.

One thing that you get from documentaries like this that you CANNOT get from professional documentaries is the entire footage. Professional documentaries often show you the highlights, but they do not show you the entire footage so you can see the event in context. Context is very meaningful, and this documentary makes strong use of it.

The 2nd disk is not as impressive as the first. For one, it does have the same introduction as the first, which talks about what NASA does to hide ""anomalies."" But it only features one object, whereas the first disk features quite a few of them. And the object featured on the 2nd disk was not as impressive to me as the others. In fact I am thinking it could have been an object outside the depth of field (out of focus) coming into resolution from the distance as the Shuttle passes it. Chandeller attempts to show that NASA tried to ""debunk"" the object we had seen by focusing the cameras on lights to cause a lens flare, which looks similar, but I'm not so sure this was what they were doing. If not, the purpose doesn't jump out at me, I admit, but that presumes every single thing they do with that camera has some extraordinary purpose.

The 1st disk is worth the price of the documentary alone.",1213660800,15,3074,4.75984990619137
2828836,5,B000PY52FE,"This is an excellent video.  The evidence is undeniable.  There is something out there and we are not alone.

Well worth the money and time to view.",1213488000,,148,4.407407407407407
2828837,3,B000PY52FE,"The main video is pretty good. I like the narrators style, he presents things with a sense of humor. The footage is quite good and compelling for the most part. The negative is that the 2nd disc is almost exactly the same as 2nd. Why bother putting 2 DVDs and calling it a set when it's duplicate material. Aside from that it's worth watching. The scene of UFOs going into a thunderstorm where you can clearly see them entering the cloud layer (so it can't be ice) is worth the price alone!",1201564800,4,490,4.336956521739131
2828838,3,B000PY52FE,"The second disc was exactly the same as the first one, other than that very interesting stuff",1188777600,6,93,4.529411764705882
8193902,5,B000PY52FE,"Jeff Challender is creator of this video. A lot of people do not know that he was 100% disabled and created this documentary from the confines of a debilitating disease. So, while the production value of the film doesn't seem 100% up to par, the details he uncovers are excellent.

And now that we live in a time when UFO news is beginning to go mainstream, this is a film people should check out to see how often and how much of the real information has been kept from the public.

Jeff is also the narrator of the film. And he has a bit of a monotone and dorky voice. But, to me, this makes it all more authentic and special.",1522713600,,627,4.1735537190082646
8193903,4,B000PY52FE,"Watched this on Prime.  It's not for everyone, no, but I liked it, and thought some of the footage was rather compelling, especially the Chicago objects with the stumbling NASA commentary in the background.  If you are expecting a super-professional product full of definitive proof, this isn't it.  If you are really intrigued by the subject of UFOs you'll probably find at least something that interests you here.  For those who just have a casual interest, it probably won't hold your attention.  To each his own.",1514678400,,516,4.953488372093023
8193904,1,B000PY52FE,"Possibly the worst of all the UFO videos on Amazon.  Bad writing, bad narration, bad footage, bad editing, bad effects, bad sound, and an altogether bad idea.  Really awful.  I've seen kids build better videos than this.",1513641600,,220,4.891891891891892
8193905,5,B000PY52FE,Ignore the negative reviews. Most likely they're paid NASA (Never A Straight Answer) trolls trying to downplay the obvious. Those were UFO's plain and simple.,1510358400,,158,5.36
