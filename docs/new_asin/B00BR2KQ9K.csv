8573022,5,B00BR2KQ9K,"I got this DVD as a gift from a friend of mine, and it was one of the most interesting gifts I had ever received! I learned the exercises from the DVD and have been practicing them as often as I can. After learning them they are easy to do and can be done when waiting for the bus or for the elevator. It's amazing to see that just like the muscles on the body, the muscles on the face and the neck can feel the same, tight and firm. I am very happy to have gotten this information because I believe that it is very important to care for your appearance!",1445558400,,554,3.955357142857143
