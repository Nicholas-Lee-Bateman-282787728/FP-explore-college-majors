1235720,5,B00000JNWT,I recommend this book for beginner to intermediate basketball player who wants to improve skills. Contains everything from defense stance to basketball shooting.,1018224000,6,161,6.043478260869565
1235721,5,B00000JNWT,"We watched the first tape tonight (offensive basics) and we were delighted with it.  As some reviewers have noted, it is not entertaining; but, that's not why I got the tape.  We have many tapes and DVDs that ARE entertaining.  This one does one thing and does it well: it teaches kids the fundamentals of roundball and gives them great drills.  I had to stop the tape so they could go to bed--they loved it. Highly recommended.",1012867200,11,428,4.51948051948052

Highly recommend.",1012867200,4,651,4.568965517241379
1235723,3,B00000JNWT,"I bought this video mostly because I wanted to improve my ball handling. I found some of the drills useful and found the tips on protecting the ball and using behind the back and spin dribbles useful. However, I found ""48 BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP DRILLS"" much more useful.",997833600,7,271,4.787234042553192
1235724,5,B00000JNWT,"These two videos offer excellent instruction in basic individual offensive and defensive techniques. The videos are well made and clear, but not highly entertaining. While I think they could be used for young kids, the viewing time would have to be limited or their attention would quickly drift.",996969600,2,296,5.1875
1235725,5,B00000JNWT,This is the definitive tape to help anyone interested in playing or coaching basketball to succeed. You'll love it!,993427200,,115,5.105263157894737
1235726,5,B00000JNWT,"This is an amazing series that will help anyone interested in the game of basketball. Coach Wilkens helps you by showing each drill in slow motion. You can tell he knows what hes talking about,after all he is an NBA Hall of Famer. I hope you buy this video and i promise it will help.",971395200,2,284,4.181818181818182
1235727,5,B00000JNWT,Breaks down difficult skills into easy to understand demonstrations and explanations.  Key points and errors are reinforced.  Great for teaching intermediate or higher level youth players.  The team defense portion has  enabled my teams to improve its defense significantly.,946339200,6,274,5.948717948717949
1235728,5,B00000JNWT,"The video shows players in various situations (1 on 1, 3 on 4, two lane  drill formation etc.) executing moves that are being taught.  Coach Dick  Helm introduces the lesson, and then describes the skills as they are being  demonstrated.  Coach Lenny Wilkens then recaps the lesson and the  demonstration (using a chalkboard).  His critique includes both the good  and the bad points exhibited in the demonstration.  I have been amazed and  educated by what Coach Wilkens can observe -- I would have missed some  things in the demonstrations were it not for him pointing them out.  I find  it useful to replay the video in slow motion in order to see clearly what  he saw in real-time.  For some of the skills being taught, game situations  in which they can be used (and those in which they should not be used) are  mentioned.  A valuable aspect of the lessons on shooting is that they do  not assume the player has the ball and is about to begin his shot -- the  shooting lessons include lessons on what goes on before, during, and after  a shot (getting open, shooting on the move, rebounding etc.).  While the  lessons may be too quick for a beginner, I recommend it to any intermediate  or advanced player who wants to hone his skills",939772800,,1239,4.552511415525114

7912928,5,B00000JNWT,"For teaching Grand Daughter to better handle the ball.  The weather in central Ohio has not allowed much use, but will long before basketball season starts.",1395705600,,156,5.0
7912929,5,B00000JNWT,"If you are looking for one dvd for your child to learn the game this it, I bought 2 others that were somewhat disappointing. This is good coaching.",1393977600,,147,4.285714285714286
7912930,2,B00000JNWT,Wilkens tries to explain the basics of basketball from the smallest detail.  The problem is Wilkens fails to make the subject interesting.  I doubt children would be able stay interested long enough to gain any value from the DVD.,1390262400,,230,4.871794871794871
7912931,2,B00000JNWT,"If you are only buying one, make it the Steve Nash's DVDs (2 in one).  As a former high school coach in Ohio and Kentucky, I find Pistol  Pete's DVD to be good, Lenny Wilkins' DVD to be fair, but Steve Nash's the best I've seen.",1360713600,,228,3.9347826086956523
7912932,3,B00000JNWT,I wanted to a DVD that would suit both me as a coach and my son (6 year old) as a beginner. I echo other reviews on this product on how it is best avoided for little kids as too dry. I also had difficulty staying awake.,1268611200,,219,3.6808510638297873
7912933,5,B00000JNWT,"Excellent instructional video. Before each lesson Lenny provides bullet points on the points to remember. They then show highly skilled player demonstrate. Lenny freeze frames and uses chalk to show the most important points. I've bought several books and DVDs on basketball and so far, this is the best. Highly recommended.",1229817600,,324,5.372549019607843
7912934,5,B00000JNWT,"This is an outstanding video.  The pace is right and the voice over is the right speed.  I bought it for my 7 and 8 year old daughters, but realized that they would only be able to digest the large amount of information in small bites.  So we watch and then break to practice.  You may wish to sit thru each video in one sitting, but spread it out for your kids.  Like the Chinese say (my kids are half Chinese) Hear and forget, see and remember, do and understand.  Excellent pair of videos.",1060560000,11,492,4.180851063829787
