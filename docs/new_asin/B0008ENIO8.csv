Others have plots so rich and involving that cheap sets and bad production values are easily forgiven and forgotten.  Then there are movies like County General.  County General is at its core supposed to be a comedic black exploitation movie.  County General has only one real problem, WHERE'S THE COMEDY!  To a movie like County General an almost steady stream of comedy is foundational to the success of the movie.  I watched County General from beginning to end and there is not a single rip roaring laugh or even a chuckle in the entire movie.

When yoou are telling a joke visually it needs to be set up so the audience can identify with the characters in crisis.  You have to like the characters.  You have to tell a back story for the characters so they don't come off as props or plot points.  County General does nothing right except the establsihment shot for the County General Hospital Building.  I don't care about the production values which for a low budget film were quite good in County General.  the most difficult thing in watching County General is the props, locations and other elements were pretty darn good.  The hospital was convincing enough the thing about County General that was simply Dead On Arrival was the Comedy.

County General is simply NOT FUNNY AT ALL NOT IN THE VERY LEAST LITTLE BIT FUNNY.  If there was one atom of comedy in County General it was sought out and ruthlessly destroyed by this lame and lack luster script. Trust me the actors were no comedic gems either.  The actors played their roles too straight.  The actors did not seem as if they were having fun in the roles.  There was zero chemistry between the actors. County General should have been named Actors Trying To Act Funny & Failing Beyond Measure.  I usually keep bad movies because; even bad movies have someone good I enjoyed.  County General is so bad I won't be keeping it.  Where I work they raise money for charity by selling books and DVD's I will be sure to give them this DVD to sell for whatever they can get.

This movie is sad not because it is a low budget movie.  This movie is sad because; but for the lack of any comedy whatsoever this would have been a fun little movie.  I won't blame the actors entirely because they may have been better than this script.  The director of County General was not a motivator.  To get the best out of actors you have to get them stirred up.  You have to get them to buy into your vision of the film.  Creating Good Comedy is about being over the top at times.  Good Comedy is an electricity the actors project out into their audience.  County General does none of these things.  I'm actually not happy writting this reivew because; County General had real potential to be funny.  The jokes about an urban ghetto hospital are numerous and priceless but the script writers found none of them.

I worked at an urban hospital in the ghetto before I got my great job.  When I worked in a urban Hospital in Baltimore years ago the pay was low.  The work  was extremely hard physical labor and the professional staff looked upon me as if I were pond scum. The only real fringe benefit of working at a large urban hospital in a poor run down area is the place was electric to overflowing with endless varieties of comedy.  You see things and people that just blow your mind in urban inner city hospitals serving poor folk. The rich may rule money but the poor own true comedy lock stock and barrel. Poor folk own comedy because laughter and joy can neither be taxed or spent.  What makes County General bad is its subject was rich with comedic potential but the vast humorous wealth of this poor inner city hospital subject matter was left untapped. County General was a comedic star that failed  to be born.  If I could have rated zero stars I would have.  There is nothing about County General worth keeping it had so much promise and in the end did so little this the watching this waste of time, talent and energy was morbidly depressing.",1416441600,2,4089,4.486449864498645

8055947,1,B0008ENIO8,"In this supposed comedy, a graduate student in film records the goings-on at County Hospital where his girlfriend works.  The movie is a bit of a way to critique healt care provision in inner cities:  shady workers, unethical doctors, incorrect operations, etc.  Still, this movie had no plot, bad acting, bad timing, and lots of gross-out humor.

Okay, I'm ashamed that this is one of my first comments, but here it goes:  the cover says it has nudity and it does not!  There are sexual situations, but there is no clear view of male or female genitalia.  Total false advertising!

I guess you could say the Caucasian characters here play the role of ""straight guy.""  However, there is a way in which whites are portrayed as sane and Blacks as foolish.  Maybe it's beneficial that Black actors and actresses get to perform the comedy in a comedy, but there was still something unsettling about this dynamic.

Like in many African-American films (""Sprung,"" ""Foolish,"" ""Coming to America,"" etc.), the light-skinned leading female gets to be portrayed as more worthy, loving, and virtuous than any of the dark-skinned Blacks.  So offensive and stereotypical!  The villain of the film is a man named Dr. Patel.  Though Patel is a common Indian name, the character is monoracially Black and never once mentions being part Indian.  Did the directors think a Black character won't be seen as bad if he has an Indian name?  Did Indian actors refuse to play the role?  Are the directors trying to say so many Indians are doctors that a hospital couldn't exist without a Patel on staff?  Regardless, this appellation was odd and possibly insensitive to both Indians and Blacks.

I love seeing Black actors and actresses being able to work their craft.  Nevertheless, this was a god-awful movie that was painful to watch and should have never been greenlighted in the first place.",1152144000,6,1870,4.876190476190477
