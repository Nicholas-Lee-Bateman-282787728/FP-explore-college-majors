7799422,5,1583700331,"The Unfinished Nation (video type) has even been used for educational TV purposes, as video courses for GED. It's a very thorough and comprehensive retrospect of the challenges and progesses of what the nation has been through, for centuries. The script is well-written and explains some of the elements that other histories might not include! If one can find a used copy of the DVD set, at a reasonable price, then you should FIND it. I'm sure the book-version is very fine, also ... but haven't looked-through one.",1317600000,,516,4.875
