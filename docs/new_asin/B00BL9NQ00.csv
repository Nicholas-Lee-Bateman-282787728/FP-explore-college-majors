5643470,5,B00BL9NQ00,"Unlike a lot of multi-movie sets, this set has 4 separate discs with color photos on them. They are stacked together on one hub in the case and do not scratch each other.  They are very easy to remove and replace. The set of 4 movies is c 2013 pkg. design Warner Bros Ent. LLC & c 2013 Paramount Pictures,distributed by Warner Home Video. Each movie is dual format except The Hunter.

Here is the information for each individual move/disc. Where I have ""Disc:"" the disc shows information that is actually printed on the disc.  The movies are all WS and 16x9. Papillon is also 2.4:1.

 Bullitt, rated PG, English Dolby Surround, 114 mins., c 1968, renewed 1996 Warner Bros Ent Inc, Chad McQueen & Terry McQueen (successors-in-interest to Solar Productions Inc.), Disc 1: only shows c 1968, ""no copying"" and ""US Not Rated."" I put this disc in my laptop and it shows that it is Disc 1 of the ""Special Edition"" set and has the commentary by Director Peter Yates and trailer as well as English & French language and Subtitles in English, French and Spanish: Menu Design and Supplementary Material C 2005 when you click ""more"" on menu after the languages. (Disc 2, which has additional extra features, is not included, of course.) Note that although the case shows PG rating for Bullitt, the disc shows ""US Not Rated."" Maybe it became rated after the disc was pressed.

 Papillon, rated PG, English 5.1 Surround, 150 mins., c 1973, renewed 2001 Filmtransac A.G. Artwork c 1978, Menu & Summary C 1999. Disc: C 2005 Warner Bros. Ent.

Nevada Smith, Not rated, English Mono, 130 mins., c 1965, renewed 1993 Paramount Pictures, Embassy Pictures Corp., and Solar Productions, Inc. Disc: c 2003 Paramount Pictures, CC.

I have watched The Hunter only and I thought it seemed to be grainy at first but it was because The Hunter's (Papa Thorsen character) yellow automobile had tiny mud splatters on the lower front and sides at the beginning of the movie.

This set is a DEAL, being so inexpensive after being just released this year.",1375920000,27,2353,4.8283582089552235

5643472,5,B00BL9NQ00,"Bullitt not only rivals that of Vanishing Point dame for car chases, but it has a great cast of actors & great acting to make it a 5 star movie !!! McQueen is still legendary & a man's man who died way before his time sadly :-(.
Pappillion was a very well acted movie with McQueen & Dustin Hoffman & the scenery & backdrop with which the movie takes place were well chosen as well as historically accurate.
The other two McQueen movies in this 4-pack DVD set, The Hunter and Nevada Smith were good McQueen movies, albeit not his best acting, but entertaining and fun to watch because it's McQueen !!!",1498348800,,600,4.366071428571429
