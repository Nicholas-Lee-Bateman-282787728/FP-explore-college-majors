8415802,5,B004439ABY,"Truly Hawaiian style.  He is laid-back, which lowers my beginner anxiety.  His confidence and poise which probable reflects his years of experience and competition, helps me know that I can reach the goal of being comfortable and competent at my level.  He makes it look like fun, the mark of a great teacher.",1398556800,,309,4.7924528301886795
8415803,2,B004439ABY,"I was looking for an instructional video that would show me in detail the correct paddling technique. Thinking that if I paid for an instructional video it would offer more instruction than what is freely available on the internet. I was wrong,",1372982400,,244,4.833333333333333
8415804,3,B004439ABY,"I felt this was a bit dissapointing, for such a bold title of mastering technique it really didn't serve that purpose well at all. A lot of points weren't covered.",1369267200,,163,4.466666666666667
8415805,2,B004439ABY,"Was disappointed with the lack of content.  This guys is a world class paddler and doesn't do much beyond the basics.  There are some many paddle combinations you would expect a guy at this level to put in a $30 video.  A lot of the video is him standing on land talking with a paddle in his hand, some old clips thrown in and some new stuff.  Worth maybe $10-15 but definately not $29.",1349827200,4,386,4.175675675675675
