4071693,3,B0035WTYKM,I was very surprised to find that Boise had a major prostitution ring in the 50's. Really enjoyed this story.,1357084800,3,109,4.5
4071694,1,B0035WTYKM,"I wish I could do a review,but the movie did not load
Basically,amazon got my money and gave me zilch in return

I will not be ordering any movies this way in the future",1356480000,,169,3.9705882352941178
4071695,4,B0035WTYKM,"This video presents an interesting bit of Idaho and U.S. history.

The documentary part is quite well done. The retrospective part, where some of the people involved or their acquaintances were interviewed 40 years or so later, is good.

The video breaks down when it attempts to support an agenda, proclaiming that certain sex acts have since been legalized; it loses track of the fact that much of what was happening - male homosexual pedophilia - is still prohibited.

4071697,1,B0035WTYKM,"Here is my review. Why is Amazon charging 275.00 for a film documentery.
Made on a DVD-R ? Can anyone answer that?",1266883200,,114,4.2272727272727275
4071698,4,B0035WTYKM,Touching but not 5 stars worthy. Needs a re-edit and a bit more involving journalistic views. I mean  a more investigating storytelling then one-off person views.,1436400000,2,162,5.230769230769231
4071699,4,B0035WTYKM,"I knew nothing of this incident in American history, thus I found the documentary quite informative; in fact, I am now reading the ""classic"" book written in the 1960s about the event, ""The Boys of Boise"" by John Gerassi.  While informative, the film lacks panache and the ""polish"" of a documentary produced for cable television and/or PBS.  Some of the video clips included in the film were unclear/pixilated, and the volume level was inconsistent.  I also thought the film could have been 20 minutes shorter, since several of the points were repeated.  Overall, this is a very good, albeit low budget, documentary.",1431907200,3,615,5.0
4071700,4,B0035WTYKM,"It was a clear depiction of a time, where ""gay people didn't exist"". In the majority of people's minds, or when it did to them it was disgusting and immoral. Driving people underground and secretive in their activities, disguising their lives to fit the norm.",1431302400,,259,4.777777777777778
4071701,1,B0035WTYKM,"If there is a worthwhile story to be told about the events in Boise in 1955, it's obscured by this movie's incompetence. It seems like an uninspired parody of Ken Burns's formulaic and pretentious historical documentaries for PBS, in which a disembodied narrator reads from contemporary sources (in this case, a single Boise newspaper) and follows each reading with the name of the source.

When the source is almost always the same source, that already tiresome formula quickly becomes unbearable - like the second or third time this narrator solemnly says ""The Evening Standard"" (or whatever its name was) after reading from the newspaper for about 10 seconds. By the time he'd said the same three words the same way a dozen or more times I was ready to pull my hair out. I was no longer able even to listen to what he was reading from the paper, because I knew that another horrible ""The Evening Standard"" was only seconds away.

But he's only one of this movie's several unseen narrators. That man reads the bits from the newspaper, but another narrator, the one who fills in most of the gaps between his readings from the paper, is a woman who is even worse than he is. The first time she pronounced ""escape"" as if it were spelled ""excape"", I had to do an instant replay because I couldn't believe my ears; but there it was.

At least this movie doesn't use the other even more annoying gimmick that's practically universal in historical documentaries now, which is the dramatic reenactment of historical events. I really can't stand those dumbed-down reenactments, as if we would never believe that the Declaration of Independence was signed unless we saw bad actors doing it on TV.

This movie doesn't have those, but I'm pretty sure it would if the producers had had the money for D-list actors and chintzy sets and costumes. The western world is now populated by people who can't grasp anything unless they see it acted out on TV, the more like a soap opera the better. The entire 8+ hours of HBO's silly&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-Adams/dp/B000WGWQG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John Adams</a>&nbsp;miniseries was like that, and people loved it.

I may follow another reviewer's excellent suggestion and read the book on which this incompetent movie is based (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Boys-of-Boise-Furor-Vice-and-Folly-in-an-American-City/dp/B0007DKKI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Boys of Boise: Furor, Vice and Folly in an American City</a>). I'd rather read on my own than be read to by an idiot who evidently thinks I've forgotten where he got the stuff he reads and has to remind me every ten seconds.

Or I may just leave Boise in its petty, ignorant past and get on with my own life. I'm certainly not learning anything about the town from this movie, except that it has the worst newspaper in the United States.",1427500800,,2933,5.2165605095541405
4071702,4,B0035WTYKM,"This film is an important piece of history in that it shows how twisted America was in the 1950's concerning attitudes about sex.  If we want to grow in our understanding  of other people, we need to see other films like this to help us understand the harm we cause just because we are afraid to know more about the things we fear.  Ignorance is not a virtue.",1420070400,3,359,4.25
4071703,5,B0035WTYKM,Pictorially rather static but story and interviews are fascinating.,1419984000,,67,6.555555555555555

4071705,4,B0035WTYKM,This movie was sad and vey well done. I wish they could have interviewed the young men caught up in the scandal for another perspective.,1418601600,2,136,4.48
4071706,3,B0035WTYKM,Was everyone in this town crazy or just run of the mill christians?,1416700800,,67,4.230769230769231
4071707,3,B0035WTYKM,"Actually, I'm a bit confused by the film. Many of those interviewed refer to the witch hunt that was spawned due to the scandal.  As I see it, there were two issue: (1) adult men paying underage boys for sex, and (2) adult homosexual activity in this mid-western city.  These are two very different issues.  We can discuss how 'homosexuality' was viewed in the 1950s, and there being sodomy laws on the books in Idaho at the time.  Perhaps that would be an interesting topic all it's own.  But the real scandal I see is: adult (closeted) men paying underage boys for sex.  I am gay, and as a gay man, if I were in Boise in 1955, I would be outraged to learn adult men having sex with underage boys. And it's irrelevant that some of the boys were 17 years old and initiating the prostitution enterprise.  Adult men should have the wherewithal to not engage.  I would probably be leading the charge to prosecute every last one of them.  You don't mess around with children- I don't care how closeted you are.",1416009600,,1006,4.423913043478261

4071710,4,B0035WTYKM,This was a balanced and well researched documentary in to a tragic series of events in a '50's small town. Well done,1402012800,2,116,4.318181818181818
4071711,5,B0035WTYKM,"We had heard rumors about the Boys of Boise for decades, but we never knew all the details. This documentary provides lots of insight on this ""homosexual hysteria"" in Idaho's capitol city. In 1955, the city prided itself on its wholesome, straight lifestyle with a Mom and Dad with two kids living in a home with white picket fences. Most residents felt the city of Boise reflected the best of America. But to the shock of many, there were actually homosexuals secretly living among them. And in the height of the McCarthy era hearings during the Eisenhower Administration, some of those homosexual residents appeared ""normal."" About 14 men were arrested for crimes against nature, and the men reflected many walks of life, including a banker, lawyer, a high school janitor and an actor. The film points out how America slowly came to terms with people's diverse sexuality. By the time the police investigations ended, most regretted getting involved in people's personal lives. But a few felt the city had been tarnished by a ""virus"" they never really wanted. They were more like San Francisco and New York than they ever would admit. This is an interesting film, and is still relevant today in light of the campaigns by fundamentalist Christians to persecute gays. The film points out the dangers of ignorance and hysteria.",1391126400,5,1325,4.946188340807175
4071712,3,B0035WTYKM,"The well-documented witch hunt in Boise, Caital of Idaho, in 1955.  The narrative and motivations of those involved are clearly presented.  In 1955 I was living in Columbus, Ohio (native of California) in a relationship and with my friend's family - not many problems in those days - society with those I knew were easy and my way of lving accepted.  I don't think we were even aware of what was going in Idaho.  So, it's of great interest to see this film.  But rather frustrating to watch, thus only three stars.",1375228800,,514,4.543478260869565
4071713,3,B0035WTYKM,"This film does  a great job of showing the paranoia and ""witch-hunt"" mentality that took place in Boise, to eradicate any evidence that such ""perversion"" might exist in their squeaky clean home town.

What is missing is any direct input from the ""boys"" who apparently willingly sold themselves to older men to make some quick cash.
I would have liked to hear their side of the story - who started it; how it spread; were all the young men gay or not; did anyone feel coerced into doing this?  And what became of them.",1375056000,9,517,4.4787234042553195
4071714,4,B0035WTYKM,"Shocking in that such a large and wide-spread ""organization"" was operating right under people's noses.... but not shocking when I think back to my childhood in the early 60s and remember ""hush talk"" of the same thing going on in my very small Texas hometown.  Makes you wonder just what's happening today that we know nothing about.",1367452800,,332,4.824561403508772
4071715,3,B0035WTYKM,"It's hard to say that I like this film, since the subject is so depressing: anti-gay mass hysteria in Boise, Idaho, in 1955, and how it ruined people's lives. But it does a decent job of telling its story. It made me think of The Crucible, Arthur Miller's play about the Salem witch trials. The film is also makes reference to Joe McCarthy and the anti-communist witch hunts of the same period.  The film is a good reminder of how much things have changed in the past 50 years and in some ways of how much things haven't. I suspect Boise is a more civilized place these days.  I'm not so sure about other parts of the country.",1366243200,,626,4.296610169491525
4071716,5,B0035WTYKM,"A very well-researched and balanced history of the long-forgotten witch-hunt of gay men and boys in Boise, Idaho.
Under the specter of the Red Scare that was sweeping the US nationally, Seth Randal starts with John Gerassi's explosive book of 1967 as his jumping off point and interviews the participants, witnesses, by-standers and victims of a mid-twentieth century witch-hunt.  Using unearthed footage and photographs of Boise in the early 1950's, and specifically, the summer and fall of 1955, Randall exposes the bias and animus that was stirred up in the wake of a 'sex-for-pay' syndicate devised by the young men of Boise.  A ""Must"" watch documentary for anyone interested in exploring the roots of anti-gay discrimination in America.",1364515200,3,741,5.271186440677966
4071717,4,B0035WTYKM,"I really enjoyed this documentary about a topic I knew very little about in the past.  I think it was clearly a difficult time for both the prosecutors and the offenders involved in these cases, and the producers do a good job trying to show both sides of the stories and how it affected a small town where these kinds of scandals are not supposed to happen.  Parts of it were heartbreaking when you think about the lives who were damaged by this witch hunt, including the officers who felt they were entirely in the right about what they were doing.  Some families are clearly still dealing with fallout from this, nearly 60 years later.  I do wish there could have been more talking heads in the video, but many have died, moved away to places unknown, or simply felt too uncomfortable to speak on camera.  It would have been more rounded if more stories could have been told.",1363046400,7,878,4.49685534591195
