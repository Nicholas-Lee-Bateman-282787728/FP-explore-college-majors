This is an excellent collection that includes a majority of the Grateful Dead's commercially released movies.  The only negative in my opinion is that the outer box (while it looks very cool) is actually very flimsy.  I think they should have gone with a better-made, stronger box.  But the DVD's themselves are so great (and they each have their own very adequate plastic case) that I'm still giving a full 5-star rating.  I'm certainly very happy with this purchase - that's quite a few hours of excellent Grateful Dead video for a very reasonable price.

Jerry was a little off. We all know that. Still, he came through with some great solos from time to time. I sure miss that guy.

I'd trade you three ""Views"" for it.

This was a band authorized filming. It was historic. Granted I am a crotchety 'ol deadhead with a great respect for Pigpen (he was still alive but he sadly missed this show). None the less, it has the raw energy of the primitive band. I have no economic ties or intrests to the band or anyone else involved, only emotional ones.

I see that a new and improved version of Sunshine Daydream is coming out for limited distribution in theaters for Jerry's Birthday this year (8/1). I suspect the improved version will soon be available from the authorized Dead folks (Rhino?) rather than the rather lame version from Spain that Amazon sells.

Several of these I hadn't seen in years since they were never released on DVD.  At $100 this has to be one of the best bang for your buck DVD collections out there.  It is literally everything that has been an official release from the Dead.  The quality of both sound and visuals is fantastic, too.  My personal favorite era is '69-'74, but the shows from '89-'90 are really fun to watch.  The boys are in fine form and the playing is great.  If you're into the Dead then this is your box set.

5059477,5,B00772M2Y6,"I've always had a healthy respect for Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead, but I'm one of the people that was born in the 1960's and came to know them by way of their brief appearance in the Billboard Top 100 with ""Touch of Grey"" (and to a lesser extent ""Hell In a Bucket"") and the subsequent MTV video featuring the dancing skeleton puppets.  Their brief rennaissance, which began in 1987 and fizzled by 1992 (after which time Jerry turned his attention to his acoustic side projects with David Grisman-a large percentage of which were released posthumously) left many of us wanting more but not really knowing where to look.  I DID listen to the nationally syndicated radio show ""The Grateful Dead Hour"" at one point, but this stopped airing in Chicago some time ago and is only available as a webcast I believe.

My generation are much more familiar with Phish,which zoomed in to fill the void after Jerry Garcia's death in 1995, as well as other jam bands such as String Cheese Incident, Dave Matthews Band, Widespread Panic, and a number of others who took the same improvisational music approach and moved it in different directions.

At any rate, it's taken me about 2-3 years to study/revisit their catalog, during which time I've picked up a variety of the ""Dick's Picks"" series, the three ""Vault"" releases, two of the ""Road Trips"" series, some ""Pure Jerry"" titles, all of the Garcia/Grisman releases, the Old & In the Way bluegrass titles, the Merl Saunders/Jerry Garcia Keystone recordings, a greatest hits compilation, some free mp3 downloads from the group's own website and various other live discs made available by Arista.  I've also read ""Dark Star"", ""Garcia: An American Life"", ""Garcia: A Signpost To New Space"", ""The Complete Annotated Grateful Dead Lyrics"" and ""Dead Letters"".  I've also managed to attend a Furthur concert featuring Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, Sunshine Garcia and John Kedlicek (previously reknowned for his participation in the Dark Star Orchestra-a GD cover band).

After all of this exploration, the only real gap in my collection was video.  Once again, it looked like a daunting task because of the depth and breadth of their catalog.  I wanted to focus my attention on the strongest era musically, which I believe to be the Keith & Donna Godchaux era from 1973(?) to 1979.  Most deadheads have narrowed this down further, stating that the group was better BEFORE their self-imposed ""break"" in the mid-1970's than AFTER the break.  I would argue that they played at a consistently high level throughout the 70's, and became better musically after the departure (God rest his soul) of Ron McKernan, who may've been a big part of the group's overall attitude/personality, but wasn't really an outstanding singer, musician or songwriter.  I'll never quite understand people's fascination with Ron's 1/2 hour rendition of ""Turn On Your Lovelight"".  It's a simple song.

Unfortunately, there just aren't many official video releases from the 1970's other than ""The Grateful Dead Movie"" and ""The Closing of Winterland"", which are both excellent.  So...this collection is a little heavy on stuff from the 1980's, which is basically the Brent Mydland era.  By this point the Grateful Dead were slowly descending into self-parody, much like Elvis Presley did in the 1970's.  If you watch these titles in succession, you will notice Jerry getting more and more bloated, his voice getting weaker, his hair getting whiter and his solos getting less and less interesting.  This process, from 1980-1986, reached it's apex when he went into a diabetic coma for several days.  His hard-partying ways had finally caught up to him.  He emerged from this low point with renewed vigor, which led to the last great period for the group: from 1987-1990.  There's A LOT of footage from this era, as if the band instinctively knew that their window of opportunity was closing fast.  And sure enough, Brent Mydland died in 1990 (also from drug use) and the group was never quite the same afterward.  They managed to fill Brent's void temporarily with TWO keyboard players, namely Vince Welnick from the Tubes and Bruce Hornsby (who was riding a temporary wave of popularity via his big hit ""The Way It Is"").  But this era from 1990-1992 is probably most Deadheads' least favorite, and only one title in the collection documents this period (View From the Vault II).

In the final analysis, even though the group had their ups and downs (like any band), they never lost their improvisational approach and exploratory spirit.  And even at their worst, they were better than most other bands on a good day.  It's unfortunate that much of their 1970's work was not officially captured on video, and it's unfortunate that their history was marred by the ill effects of habitual drug use.  However, this collection is the best available, and great for one-stop shoppers who don't see the need to quibble about the differences between DVD and Blue-Ray.  To be sure, High Definition/Blue-Ray is a great format, but I fear that the cost of refurbishing these old VHS videos might increase the cost of this set two or three times for only an incremental improvement in quality.  As of this writing, this entire set can be had for under $100.00, which is an incredible value.",1342310400,25,5274,4.933257918552036
5059498,5,B00772M2Y6,"For a deadhead, most of this material is already in hand. If you don't know about the Grateful Dead, it is all essential. Start at the Grateful Dead movie and work forward. Then check out Festival Express and Anthem to Beauty. For a deadhead So Far and the bonus disc make it worthwhile even if you have the rest. The booklet provides a reasonably thorough and conscise overview of the video history of Grateful Dead.",1341964800,6,417,4.573333333333333

5059500,5,B00772M2Y6,"This is a gorgeous set that combines basically all the previously released DVDs in to one giant box set for a disgustingly low price. You get all the bonus material fully intact from the original DVD releases, a full disc of new bonus stuff, and So Far for the first time on DVD. The bottom line here is that many of these DVDs have been out of print for years --- copies have been hard to find and often pricey. I think if you get this box set along with Crimson, White, & Indigo and Rocking The Cradle you've got 99% of their entire official video catalog.

Why don't they release more stuff on blu-ray?
People keep asking this question over and over. Most of the footage they have of the band was shot in lower quality / lower resolution analog tape as opposed to a higher resolution film or digital video (which didn't exist yet). The Grateful Dead Movie was shot on a high quality film stock converted to high definiton and it was shot in a full wide screen format. That's exactly why it deserved and got the blu-ray treatment. The rest of this material like the Closing of Winterland or even the 1989-91 stuff was all recorded and mastered to analog tape of some sort. It simply wouldn't benefit that much from a conversion to an HD format. It has the old 4:3 aspect ratio and the original 480 resolution, it just isn't that great to begin with. It's like watching an old episode of The Cosby Show on an HD channel -- yeah it might look a little better but it's not going to make much of a difference.",1339027200,21,1507,4.3250883392226145

5059503,5,B00772M2Y6,"I can't believe how much concert footage is here from 4 decades of the Dead's live performances - in all its glory and not so great moments too.  It's all there and more.  The only DVD I had of the Dead was the Grateful Dead movie, so buying this set was a no-brainer.  And boy am I glad I did!  I just watched a couple shows I was at in Pittsburgh and Louisville back in 1990 and the video is stellar and the sound is wonderful.  It brought back so many great memories of those shows, touring around with the dead in the late 80's & 90's, as well as pointing out some songs/moments that I didn't remember at all!  ;-)  I turned it up, started dancing, and was immersed again in another LIVE dead show...  with Jerry's beautiful, loving grin on full display, along with his incredible and unique guitar playing I've been missing.  I've only watched one of the DVD's so far and it's already worth the $100 dollars I spent.  Can't wait to see all the other shows now!  There is concert footage in the collection that is not officially listed.  What a great DVD collection for all Dead Heads to enjoy for the rest of their lives.  Phenomenal.  The Grateful Dead will live forever...",1336176000,4,1179,4.348623853211009
5059504,5,B00772M2Y6,"Will someone please inform us as to the sound on these discs? I've been able to find out about two of them have 5.1 sound. Do Winterland, GD Movie, View From Vault and most of the others have 5.1 sound? I think this is a great deal, no matter the sound. But, wouldn't it be nice to know before you buy. Can't find this info, I've been looking with no luck. Thanks.",1335225600,,364,4.069444444444445
5059505,2,B00772M2Y6,"C'mon, Guys!  First, the band puts out the regular DVD (with a bonus snipping of several frames of the film).  Then they come out with the movie in Blu-ray.  Now, we get the ol' DVD version AGAIN!  Really???",1335139200,8,207,4.368421052631579
5059506,5,B00772M2Y6,"This is the most amazing box set to come out on DVD in the history of music! I know how that sounds but I can not believe what you get for the Price. Except for two of the Discs I already owned everything else in the box and I still think it's great. P,us at this price if i had bought the two discs on their own it would come to almost the same amount. For those of you who were ticked off that very little of this box set was still avalible on their own you get it all at a greatly reduced price. I paid almost $40 for the Winterland DVD and close to $50 for the DVD of the Grateful Dead movie. Even the vault series discs were expensive when they came out. This is what you get:

The Grateful Dead movie which was originally released in theaters. This was shot on film so it looks great. The audio improvements are nothing short of incredible.

Closing Of Winterland which was originally a TV broadcast. Again amazing sound. Nice mix. Three sets of music plus the Blues Brothers to boot.

Dead Ahead while not my favorite of their DVD's it does have a great acoustic set at the beginning. It's also shot at Radio City in New York

So Far: this is the first time this has been out on DVD. I have had the video for years. Good set list. Songs are done part live in studio and the all of a sudden it's live in front of an audience. You have to watch to see what I am talking about. It's like a visual of a lot of live albums. Where they splice different sections of the same song from different performances to try and make a stronger track. That's what they have done here but they are not hiding it.

Ticket To New Years: Television broadcast of a new years eve show in Oakland. Great set but a little shorter then their other shows. But I would assume that was due to it being shown on TV. Couple of funny skits they made to run on TV between sets.

Truckin Up To Buffalo: great 4th of July show in Buffalo. Really good set list and really nice 5.1 mix

Downhill From Here: Seriously how many band would do this? The title came from the fact that the Dead thought of this as the last of their great shows as a band and after 89 they had good shows but not like their last peek period. Most Band's would never even admit that let alone name a DVD release about it. The dead would still be touring for another five years.

View From Rhe Vault volumes 1 through 4: 4 separate releases in the same series. These were films taken from the video screens during the Dead stadium years. All but one are stereo only. However they did pick some great shows. This is as close as you will get to the look and feel of a Dead show in the late 80's / early 90's

Bonus Disc: some unreleased performances and a documentary that runs about two hours.

Book containing liner notes and pictures.

This is a Dead Heads dream. Time to alter the perception and sit back and groove. This is like a trip through time. Have to leave you with the Dead's most famous line ""Lately it accured to me. What a long strange trip it's been"".",1335139200,91,3010,4.136986301369863
5059507,5,B00772M2Y6,"I grabbed this set and immediately popped in the bonus discs. I'm incredibly impressed, to say the least, with the amount of new material on this set that I haven't seen before.
