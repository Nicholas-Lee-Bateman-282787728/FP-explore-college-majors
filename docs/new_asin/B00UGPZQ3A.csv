This is a parody of the classic Western movies from the 1930s and 1940s. You can easily find better movies if you search for them. There are many 50-pack collections of old Westerns. Some based on history are The Dark Command and They Died With Their Boots On. This story is diffused and confused in comparison. The 1952 movie Shane and others are in color.",1480032000,,2412,4.259825327510917
