1891090,1,B00009VREX,"I have seen this video, and it is an absolute nightmare.  A more appropriate title for this DVD would be ""How to Improperly Install Everything My Company Sells"".

He starts the dis-assembly of the upper half of the handgun by ripping out the slide cover plate and basically saying ""This is just a cheap plastic part, you can upgrade it to metal by buying a new one from me"".  How about learning the CORRECT way of removing it?  Wouldn't that be better than destroying it?

Most of the ""accessories"" that are added are not necessary, it's just more he can sell you that you'll never need.

I carry a Glock, I've done a LOT of customization work on the many Glocks I (and others) own and carry, and the FEW things I have actually added to my firearms do EXACTLY what I want them to:  Make a perfectly good Glock more accurate, and more dependable.  If you carry a Glock and depend on it to save your life, then don't mess with it unless you know what you are doing, and don't add anything that doesn't give you a direct benefit.  You wouldn't want to mess around with re-rigging your parachute if you didn't know exactly how it worked, inside and out, would you?  If you carry a handgun for defensive purposes, then you need to take your one and only chance at survival MUCH more serious than this video allows for.

After having done much work on real firearms, and getting real world results from my efforts, here is what I would suggest:

1 - Watch ""Making Glocks Rock"" by T R Graham, and learn the CORRECT, factory approved method for completely taking your Glock apart--without destroying parts in the process.  If you watch ""Making Glocks Rock"" first, you will literally cringe as you watch this video afterward.  ""Making Glocks Rock"" will help you to understand exactly how the handgun works, what all the parts do, how they work together, and how to improve upon the factory configuration.

2 - If you want better accuracy, then learn to shoot properly.  I'm serious here, and most people don't want to hear this, but a stock Glock will out shoot most people's ability to fire it.  A stock Glock will shoot within an 8"" target at 20 yards EASILY.  If you aren't doing that well with a stock Glock handgun then it's YOU, not the handgun.  If you are sending shots below the target, then you definitely need to get some time with a firearms instructor.  It's just like hiring a golf pro to help you with your swing.  Spending an hour with a range instructor will make a HUGE difference, and there is nothing wrong with admitting you need some instruction.  Tiger Woods wasn't born a golf pro, he got there by taking instruction and practicing.  NOBODY shoots like a pro naturally, you have to be taught, just like everyone else.

3 - If you are consistently shooting within 6-8"" at 20 yards and are STILL looking for better accuracy, then the best upgrade you can do with the least amount of gunsmithing, would be an enhanced slide lock, which you can only get from T R Graham (it's the only part he sells).  This part locks up the barrel more consistently and will lead to more accurate and consistent shot placement.  It's easy to replace, and you'll have to run about 100 rounds of ammo through the gun before it really starts to get worked in (DO NOT just install it and put the handgun back in your carry holster!  NEVER MAKE ANY CHANGE to your carry handgun and then just put it in your carry holster without first taking it to the range and putting a couple boxes of ammo through it--make sure your ""parachute"" works on the ground, not in the air!)  But once it's installed and working you'll definitely see a difference.  It will typically take an inch or two off your group.  Every Glock is different, so you may see more or less of a change.  But be honest and allow for skill when assessing the change, unless you own a Ransom Rest and can do a real scientific study.  I regularly shoot sub-3"" groups at 20 yards with this modification.

There are further modifications, as outlined in ""Making Glocks Rock"", and you can get the parts from anywhere.  Essentially, the only remaining changes would be to smooth out the action and decrease the distance required for trigger reset.  But this takes some real gunsmithing skill, and shouldn't be undertaken lightly.

If you feel comfortable making changes to your Glock, and for heaven's sake use the information in ""Making Glocks Rock"" to do them, then you can smooth out the action using the methods T R Graham specifies.  This will give your Glock a very distinct feel as you take up the trigger travel and stage the trigger for firing.  A factory Glock will feel like a gravel road as you take up the trigger slack, and won't have as distinct a feel as you stage the trigger.  After working on the trigger you'll definitely feel the trigger travel stop at a distinct position.  Hold the trigger at that point, fine tune your aim, squeeze slowly, and you'll put a hole right through the center of the target.  After the shot, keep holding the trigger, slowly let up on the trigger until it resets, hold at that point, refine your aim, squeeze, and another shot will go through the center of the target.  Now you are shooting like a pro, and you don't need any fancy additions to your firearm.

Getting a distinct and smooth feel on the trigger simply requires some smoothing out of the factory parts.  Getting a very short trigger reset requires a new connector with a tab on it to control over-travel, such as the Ghost 5.0 lb Tactical Trigger Connector (buy it from whomever you want.)  You'll need a cut out ""Armorer's Orange Slide Cover Plate"" in order to do the work necessary to adjust the trigger connector, otherwise you are likely to lock the gun up while working on it.  But once you get the trigger connector properly adjusted your follow-up shots will be incredibly fast.

The only other changes I make are to sometimes add the infamous ""Underwater"" Firing Pin Spring Cups--not so I can fire the handgun under water (don't do that...), but so that any debris that is blown through the firing pin hole will pass through and out of the firing pin channel.

These changes, if properly done by a qualified individual, will enhance accuracy, consistency, and reliability.  And when you depend on something to save your life, THAT is what you want, not a bunch of junk you add onto your firearm to ""personalize"" it, or to make it ""yours"".  Just make it accurate, consistent and reliable.  It's just a tool, so make it work for you, and learn to master it.  Leave all the ""tattoos"" and designs to the posers.

If you don't feel completely comfortable doing modifications to your Glock, then take it to an armorer you trust with your life and have them make the modifications for you.  Then take your Glock to the range and put some rounds through it to make sure that everything is working the way you want it to.

If you carry a firearm for self defense, give SERIOUS consideration to ANY information people try to pass off on you.  It's YOUR life and the life of those you care about that hang in the balance.  Learn to seek the truth in what you read and watch, and sort out the useful information from the useless.  I don't mean for this post to be an advertisement for another ""product"", feel free to buy parts from the company that sells this DVD, but make all your decisions informed and knowledgeable ones.  I consider this DVD to be nothing short of a product catalog for an extensive line of products that are unnecessary.  And it includes an installation guide that falls far short of the factory recommendations.  I simply wish to offer another source of information as a comparison to this one.  Make your own judgments as to the fitness of each.  I have no link to either DVD, other than the fact that I own both and have watched both of them.  I have done a LOT of Glock work, and I have had a LOT of positive results from my efforts.

While I hope you find my post useful, I must also add this:

DISCLAIMER: I don't recommend any changes to your Glock, it works just fine the way it comes from the factory.  If you modify your firearm then you do so at your own risk and discretion.  Don't make changes based on my advice--seek appropriate professional services from a qualified gunsmith.  I take absolutely no responsibility whatsoever for what you choose to do to your firearm.  Always keep the barrel of any firearm pointed in a safe direction--never point the barrel at anything you are not willing to destroy.  Keep your finger off the trigger until you are pointing at a target you are willing to shoot.  Seek instruction from a qualified firearms instructor.  All guns are always loaded.  If you are wondering if a firearm is loaded, the answer is ""YES!""",1280966400,81,8744,4.529974489795919

Has saved me much $$$ by doing my own Glock smithing. Very professionally done. Easy to understand. Highly Recommended!
I also recommend the new updated ""Complete Glock DVD 2009 Edition"" which includes models 26, 27, 29, 30, 21SF/30SF, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 plus the disassembly of the magazines. The parts still the same.
And one more thing...... replacing the connector and other trigger parts surely lightens trigger pull but remember not to make this changes if you are using your hand gun for self-protection/home defense. As I was told by a gun manufacturer if you use your altered hand gun in self defense be prepaired to be arrested and a possibly long time in jail.
