8147177,3,B000IONJF6,"Actually saw these videos in the bargain bin at Zeller's in Vancouver, BC of all places. Picked them up for $1.00 each as a curiosity factor more than anything. Overall, I did get to learn more than what I had known about the schools of the South prior to watching this DVD, but at times, they are definitely annoying. The producers of all of these (yes, I bought ""The Ivy League"", ""The Northeast"", ""The West"" and ""The Midwest"" as well) DVD's try to put a ""hip spin"" on the commentary and analysis of the each of the schools profiled. What it entails however is a predominant use of the words ""like"", ""you know"" and the odd ""ghetto slang"" to describe institutions of higher learning. As a result, it loses a bit of credibility when it starts to sound as if the person doing the commentary for a respected four-year institution barely got out of one of those ""9-month diploma mills"" that you see commercials for on the ""Jerry Springer"" show. But if you can work through that bit of ""cringe factor"" while watching this DVD, then they are not bad . . provided you don't really spend more than $2.50 for them.",1357084800,,1105,4.475247524752476
