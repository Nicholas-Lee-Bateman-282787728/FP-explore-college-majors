8008823,5,B00019G1HQ,"Muscles and cannon balls. Good scenes and the triumph of the common folk. Bawdy and brawly action. The taking of the fort is worth the build up of the plot. Ya gotta love Steve, though.",1364083200,,185,4.314285714285714
8008824,2,B00019G1HQ,"Bought this 1982 VHS of the film with washed-out colors. Steve Reeves is a bit monolithic but well tanned, Valrie Lagrange's acting abilities should be discussed elsewhere and Panamanian coasts look a lot like the coasts of the Mediterranean sea. Chelo Alonso's dance is however superb. A DVD, sorry, a VHS intended for those of us who were kids in the 60's.",1322697600,,358,4.790322580645161

8008826,4,B00019G1HQ,"This is one of my very favorite Steeve Reeves movies. It was not filmed in the Carribean but it creates a very nice illusion. The real Morgan the pirate was, no doubt, raunchier than the handsome and well-groomed Reeves. Some torturing was done by Morgan's men but it is not known if he had anything to do with it. What is known is that he was an Englishman who became a slave to the Spanish and lead a revolt, becoming thereby a captain and a privateer. He lead his people to the rear of Panama City and attacked, as Lawrence did in the city of Aqaba. The soldiers of the city were ill-prepared to meet an attack from that side and Morgan was triumphant. He later became the governor of Jamaica and this is not shown in the movie.

The cinematography and acting are good, as is the action, and the music is wonderful. There is a stunning scene in which the magnificent and sexy Chelo Alonso dances before Captain Morgan. She then offers herself to him and, for some inexplicable reason, he turns her down and goes to kiss the far less sexy and stuck-up Spanish woman he has fallen for.

Morgan and his men want to join the pirates of tortuga. The other leader punches Reeves to put him in his place. Reeves punches him right back and says his men will only take orders from him. They have a sord fight and...you'll see. But it shows that Morgan has mercy among other attributes. Morgan and his men get, as their reward, chests full of women's clothing. They are laughed at, which the men find humiliating, but Morgan soon turns the humiliation into victory. His men put on the women's clothes to lure another ship into danger and they take the ship.

Reeves comes accross in the movie as almost a boy scout, just following his destiny because he has nothing else to do. He never says an unkind word or has a hair out of place. After all, he couldn't be blamed for being sold into slavery, right?

I watched ""Morgan the Pirate"" right before I went to Panama at the age of 16 and I had the music of this movie running through my head most of the time. It definitely enhanced my enjoyment of Panama which is a great place to visit.",1288742400,,2129,4.355163727959698
