309337,5,6301106490,"A man holds a diamond merchants wife hostage for diamonds. When the FBI finds out they send Sidney Poitier to negotiate for the release. Things go very wrong and the merchants wife and maid are killed. The killer tries to escape to Canada by killing a fisherman headed for a guided tour in the mountains of Vancouver, British Columbia. Poitier enlists the service of Tom Berenger to track the murderer who has now taken his girlfriend hostage. Thrilling and funny this movie is one of the best I have seen. Poitier and Berenger are great as bickering old FBI city smart agent and young headstrong mountain guide. If you like either of these actors you will probably love this movie. Any fans of Poitier will love this movie. Far more exciting than ""In the Heat of the Night"". If you enjoyed the remake of ""The Jackal"" with Sidney you will love it. Those Berneger fans should love it as well. Not as gory as ""Platoon"" or ""Sniper"" it still has some scenes that will have some closing their eyes.

Many people I ask have not seen this movie, and I recommend it to them. The movie takes place mainly in Washington state. It has beautiful scenery especially near Pugent Sound. The musical score is well done, and the acting is superb. Sidney Poitier as the aging FBI agent from the city and Tom Berenger as the young rugged outdoorsmen work great together with there constant bickering. Their mutual appreciation for one another slowly grows until they admire one another. Sidney saves Tom from a bear in a way that will have you laughing. Tom saves Sidney from the cold in a way that will have you wondering about what he means about mountain men with a chuckle. Good direction from Roger Spottiswoode. Sidney was 61 at the time this was filmed and he turns in one of his better performances. Kirstie Alley as Tom's girlfriend does a great job as a kidnapped guide. The whole movie keeps you guessing for some time as to the bad guys identity. Nice performances by the guided group. Many recognizable faces that have played bad guys, now all but one are just average guys. This is by far one of my favorite Action/Adventure/Mystery movies that I watch at least twice a year. Even my wife, who doesn't normally like this type movie, finds this one entertaining. Mostly because of the comradery that develops between Poitier and Berenger. I can't wait till this comes out on DVD. I have pre-ordered it and November 11th, 2003 can't get here soon enough. Now that Touchstone postponed the release I have re-ordered it ... .",1046044800,12,2516,4.628635346756152
309338,5,6301106490,"Brilliant movie! The humor, the drama, the suspense, the acting...all superb. The bear scene is a classic that makes you fall backwards laughing. A great movie that never quite made it big, a sorry epitaph for this venue of great actors, screenwriting and direction. WHEN IS IT GOING TO COME OUT ON DVD?

309339,4,6301106490,"This movie has good solid action, a compelling story line, great scenery of the Pacific Northwest.  Sidney Poitier is always very watchable and he doesn't let us down here.  I'll buy this one on DVD when it's available.",1034035200,,219,4.7368421052631575
309340,4,6301106490,"this is a good film! there are other films that deserve five stars. but ""shoot to kill"" is not that type of genre, or awe inspiring film! it certainly keeps your attention and your interest. the scenery of the pacific northwest is really beautifull, (inspired me to plan for mountaneering trips).  has some good humour! overall a good film!  and ofcourse Sydney Poitier!!!  anyway definetly worth seeing as a good mild action film. and if you are a nature lover you are also for a treat with all that mountain/nature footage!",1008028800,,525,4.747252747252747
309341,5,6301106490,"This is the first movie I saw Sidney Poitier in, and I have to say he did an excellent job.
The main characters are Sidney Poitier as an FBI agent out to catch a serial killer, Tom Berenger as a mountain man who lives in the woods, and his girlfriend Kirstie Alley who is giving a bunch of men a guided tour through the wilderness.
Some other well known actors are in the movie, but those three play the more dominant role.
I won't give away any scenes to spoil it, but I will say that the movie starts out in the city and quickly heads to the wilderness where the majority of the movie takes place. It only heads back to the city at the end.
This is one of the best suspense movies I have ever seen. You don't see the killer through most of the movie. Even once he is shown, there are so many other actors on screen as well that you don't know which one he is.
Suffice to say, excellent movie and terrific acting! Once the movie kicks into high gear, you won't leave your seat.
The killer has an unusual trademark he does to all his victims after he kills them. You will see what I mean. The ending is very good and very well thought out. Not too many criminals would do some of the things this killer does to avoid being seen or caught.
If you like suspense, definitely check this out! You can't go wrong with Shoot To Kill!",997315200,2,1326,4.123552123552123

Poitier's FBI character is after a jewel thief that killed a woman and is heading up to Canada. To get there he has to team up with the ""mountain man"" to get the man.
Overall, a great action film with an original story in some beautiful scenery. Poitier is great as the agent ""fish out of water"". Audio and video are consistent on this film.",1482278400,,584,4.176991150442478

309634,4,6301106490,"The movie holds up pretty well after nearly 30 years.  I especially liked the conceit of keeping the killer's identity a secret for half the movie, although when I saw this movie in the theaters I was able to guess who the villain was during the opening credits -- I figured there was no way that particular actor would be cast and NOT play the villain.

Fun fact:  this is the second movie in four years (the first being 1984's ""Runaway"") in which Kirstie Alley plays a character whose life is held in jeopardy at the Robson Square waterfall in Vancouver.  That spot is bad luck for her.",1477526400,,588,4.416666666666667

This is an entertaining movie that had some exciting moments and of course the beautiful setting of the Pacific Northwest adds to the appeal overall.

I did think that a couple of scenes were rather unbelievable though:
SPOILER ALERT: Scooping out a large cave to sleep in with a couple of dishes from their backpacks, come on!!!

And Sidney taking on the bear as he did, that didn't seem likely either.

Overall though, an enjoyable film with a good supporting cast too. Les Lannom was great as the sheriff. :-)",1416355200,,667,4.579831932773109

There is plenty of dramatic among the characters and the adverse conditions they must overcome.  Berenger and Alley are 2 reclusive wilderness guides, Poitier a very much city boy FBI agent in pursuit of a dangerous criminal who has replaced one of the clients on a wilderness fishing expedition led by Alley.  Berenger is ready to go to rescue her, but Poitier insists that he must be there to make the arrest.  Sniping back and forth is common, Berenger not impressed with Poitier's backwoods skills, Alley frightened but not cowed by her captor, and the criminal is all kinds of dastardly, ruthless and mean.  The slow chase through the wilderness gives way to a closer, faster pursuit in a Canadian city, which Poitier proves his worth on his turf.  Well-paced, with some thrilling close calls for all, this is a film that can be enjoyed more than once.",1404345600,,1010,4.809248554913295

This movie is older and the CGI has not been developed.  Think of Bullitt, Gorky Park, The Needle, The French Connection, The Seven Ups, etc...  it's good but the action packed CGI junkies are not going to dig it.

I like older movies for a lot of reasons.  Acting is one of them.  The acting in this is good and if memory serves when this first came out is was an edge of your seat movie.  Having been doped by CGI as of late I have to remind myself that all that technology is fake and movies such as these are real.  It is real.  And I really liked it.",1389916800,,744,4.075862068965518

This movie reminds me in more ways than one Narrow Margin. Cop chasing killer. You don't know who killer is. Startling killer unveiling. Tense. Thriller. Canada. Slow, natural pace. No special effects in the sense of super hero or buildings blowing up. People using their wits, even the killer to earn our respect in their ""crafts"" or ""craftiness"" depending upon how you look at it. Overall good movie, entertainment even with the over enunciating, semi-effeminate Sidney Poitier trying to pull of the cop role.

Where the plot falls apart is only Tom Berenger and Sidney Poitier are chasing the bad guy.  If it was 1880 in Montana Territory,  I could see that, but this is set in the 1980's. There doesn't seem to be any state police involvement or their foreign counterparts working together.

Suddenly Shoot to Kill appears on the scene (also 1988) as an exact carbon copy of Deadly Pursuit. Why the name change? With both being available from Amazon it seems to be an outrageous rip-off that will catch some unwary buyers on the hop. Two movies, exactly the same, sold be Amazon, same actors, same story.

This movie blends Sidney Poitier in the role of an FBI agent after a murderer who travels cross-country to get to Canada. I would've loved to see Poitier use this film to revise his role as Virgil Tibbs, but he chose not to. Tom Berenger was excellent as the outdoorsman who leads him in the woods. Kirstie Alley was good as the guide kidnapped by the murderer to lead him out of the woods. This film can still be appreciated despite its first release in 1988. Much of it still holds true.

We have Kirstie Alley when she was thin, Clancy Brown (aka Kurgan from Highlander) with the deepest and weirdest creepy voice who has no problem blowing away old ladies and shooting folks in the eye, Sidney Portier and Tom Berenger having a major pee-pee contest over who is the more masculine, lots of twists and turns, and a good soundtrack.  There was an air of creepiness in several parts of this film, good use of humor at opportune times, and the way they threw in guys like Andy Robinson and Richard Masur and a few other shady guys to keep you wondering on the trail, good stuff.

310962,5,6301106490,"Terrific movie!  I've watched this several times and each time I enjoy it a little more.  Sidney Poitier as FBI agent Warren Stantin joins Tom Berenger (Jonathan Knox) to go after fugitive who has joined a group lead by Jonathan's girlfriend Sarah Rennell played by Kirstie Alley.  The chase takes place in the forests and mountains of North America.  One of the fun parts of this is both Sarah(Kirstie) and Jonathan (Berenger) are woods, forest, mountain smart but Stantin (Poitier) is not.  Since Stantin IS the FBI agent tracking, he 'requires' Jonathan take him along on the trek to rough country.  Scenery is beautiful and the supporting cast does and excellent job for the most part.  The 'chase' follows them through the mountains, streams, forests and into canada and ultimately to 'civilization' (a city).  Plot is simple and has been done many times in various ways, Narrow Margin with Gene Hackman comes to mind, same kind of general idea with different plot.  As always both Berenger and Poitier give excellent performances.  This is a good choice for an adventure movie without a lot of subtle or in depth messages.  Definitely worth purchase as you too will want to watch more than once.",1291334400,,1201,4.896039603960396

Tom Berenger, a remote and unfriendly trail guide himself, is Poitier's reluctant partner as the two men brave steep rocky cliffs, deep gorges, rapids, wild animals and snowstorms to bring the outlaw to heel.

310964,4,6301106490,"SHOOT TO KILL is worth watching not only for the fun interaction between Poitier and Berenger but, for fans of Poitier, it's probably even more relevant that their man, after ten years of directing, finally returns to the front of the camera. Not too surprisingly, he's as good as ever. No one says his lines quite like Sidney Poitier.

He plays veteran FBI agent Warren Statin, and the film starts out with his botching of a hostage negotiation. Statin becomes obsessed and follows the psychopath to the rugged wilds bordering Washington and Canada. Statin, a dedicated city slicker, ""convinces"" hostile woodsman John Knox to act as tracker. Knox is one of those independent hermit types who aren't too comfortable around people and would rather be left alone (one rube notes: ""Aw, John's alright, he's just different."").

It's a good thing for Special Agent Statin, then, that Knox's trail guide girlfriend Sarah (a really good Kirstie Alley) is escorting a party of outdoorsmen to a fishing site and that Statin's psychopath is hiding in this bunch. Knox, desperately worried for his girl (in his stoic kind of way), aims to eschew the tenderfoot trails for the harder but more direct paths. Can the FBI guy keep up?

SHOOT TO KILL effectively combines genre elements of the buddy chase flick and that of man vs. nature. The nighttime city sequences at the start of the film build the suspense and give you a feel for just how twisted the villain is. In that early segment Poitier's character, calm and cool and twenty-two years on the job, inevitably gets outsmarted and outmaneuvered. And then to really remove him from familiar territory, here come the stunning wilderness locations, and you sense just how out of sorts the big city FBI guy must feel, exposed out in the harsh borderlands, buffeted by the unforgiving climate, munching on rodent. Poitier effortlessly translates this unease on film, and often he even puts a smile on your face. The camera provides a nice, constant change of pace by smartly shifting back and forth between Statin and Knox's pursuit and the goings-on in Sarah's hiking tour.

There's a breathtaking sequence which starts with Berenger precariously navigating a rope bridge, and this was a hell of a crazy stunt and easily the highlight of the film. But SHOOT TO KILL is also graced with terrific smaller moments, some of them funny and respectively involving horses and a moose and a bear. And then, of course, there's that frequently taut, occasionally amusing interplay between Poitier and Tom Berenger, their characters very dissimilar sorts. Poitier, by the way, was in his early 60s when this film was shot, but you wouldn't have known it by watching him onscreen. He looked fit and could've passed for someone in his mid-40s or early 50s. Ever elegant and righteous and in shape is Sidney Poitier, and no amount of saddle sores or cuddling with shirtless mountainmen can change that.

This is a good and often overlooked outdoors thriller, and I've seen it a bunch of times now down the years. Poitier's performance carries the film which, by the way, does take an implausible turn in the last 15 minutes or so. And a small part of me can't help but wonder why there weren't more FBI guys in on this manhunt. But, then again, Sidney Poitier is a baaaaad man.",1268265600,,3303,4.838938053097345

311058,4,6301106490,"It is a pleasure to watch. Lots of suspense and very well filmed action scenes. Acting is first rate by the four main characters (the bad guy included, of course).
All good things said by other reviewers apply.

However, I cannot rate it 5 stars due to a couple of implausibilities, one of them a fatal flaw to the verisimilitude of the plot.

Other reviewers have pointed out, for instance, that once back in the city Berenger, a civilian, could not have been allowed to participate in the chase against an armed murderer, and even Poitier would not be allowed to go around with a gun in Canada. These are valid objections, but in my view there is a much more serious criticism.

*Spoilers*
The bad guy is a cold blooded murderer, who only keeps Alley alive because he needs her to lead him out of the woods. Then, why --apart from the Hollywood requirement that the good and brave girl must survive-- once he reaches Vancouver, he doesn't get rid of her?

311062,4,6301106490,"It wasn't until my fourth viewing of this film (and first on widescreen DVD) that (1) I finally remembered who the killer was as soon as I saw him and (2) lost a little regard for this otherwise very entertaining thriller because of the implausible ending. That said, the fact I watched this movie four times over a 12-year span tells you how good it is (especially if you forget who the killer is!)

It's a different kind of adventure story/crime thriller in that the beginning and ending scenes are both in big cities and the long middle part is in the Northwest wilderness. There is some great mountain scenery to enjoy as we tag along with two groups: one which has the killer and his hostage (a slim Kirstie Alley!) and another with an FBI man (Sidney Poitier) and his guide (Tom Berenger), who is the hostage's boyfriend.

****spoilers**** had no problems with any of this story until the last 20 minutes when both parties reached Vancouver. Then, all credibility went out the window as Berenger is allowed to be side-by-side with Poitier as the latter and the killer shoot it out in various parts of the city. It gets worse as it goes on with Poitier a dead duck a couple of times but he never dies. Only Superman could have survived what he did, but he's the ""good guy "" so he makes it in the end. A little restraint in that ending would have kept this movie just great.

Still, the story offers a lot of suspense, a lot of mystery, interesting action and scenery.....in other words, a lot to like.  If you have not seen this, this DVD is highly-recommended.",1240617600,,1566,4.484210526315789

The film has lost some of its lustre with the passage of time and viewing on the small screen, but it's still an enjoyable enough adventure/thriller hybrid with a neat premise - city cop Sidney Poitier and outdoorsman Tom Berenger have to track a psychotic killer who has tagged onto a mountain fishing trip to sneak across the Candian border. Main problem: since he's managed to avoid showing his face and the unhappy campers ranks are filled with stalwarts of movie villainy, including Andy `Scorpio' Robinson from Dirty Harry and Clancy `The Kurgan' Brown from Highlander, neither they nor we know which one is the killer (although there is a pretty big giveaway). Nothing unexpected happens and the ending doesn't gain any points for credibility, but it's entertaining enough stuff with a good score from John Scott that adapts itself well to city and mountain milieus.

311133,4,6301106490,"Shoot to Kill is one of Sidney Poitier's more interesting movies during the last part of his career. In this movie, he played an aging, city-grown FBI agent on a trail of a wicked murderer and kidnapper played by Claney Brown who flee into the deep wilderness with his victim. Aiding him is a mountain man played by Tom Berenger who have a special interest in this case since the latest kidnapped victim happened to be his girlfriend played by Kristie Alley.

The movie proves to be highly entertaining, well acted and well scripted. Interestingly, Poitier and Berenger played off each other pretty well as mutual respect grows between them as they chased after Brown and Alley. Brown proves to be quite good and I have to admit that Alley wasn't too bad either.

The movie maintained a good even pace and keep the audience wondering about the possible outcome. There are several interesting and funny scenes as describes previously by another reviewer. The movie take a perception of a ""fish out of the water"" concept. I have to admit that Sideny Poitier is NOT someone I would thought would be in a movie about being in wilderness. Poiter portrayed his wilderness unease quite well. Overall, I hate to think that this movie might be considered to be ""overlook"" by Sidney Poitier fans. Berenger gave one of his better performances in a ""non-historical"" role (he's quite good in playing Longstreet and Theodore Reoosevelt in these TNT shows).

The DVD of this movie is your basic stripped down verison. There's no extras to speak off althought the wide-screen 16:9 image proves to be pretty good and sounds were clear and easy to listen. Bit disappointing that it was given such a cheap treatment.

Overall, a highly entertaining movie that can endured repeated viewings by most fans of Poitier or Berenger. Its a movie that deserves to be seen.",1172275200,6,1845,4.8107255520504735

they could never dig that great snow-hole in time with what they had and would not have digged it totally out in the open blast of the storm - there were rocks in the background - and so fast that the rucksack had hardly snow on and around it, after they finished digging;

the guide had ample time to plan to escape, why should she wait until they are back near civilization;

The lead up to our villian's disappearence into the wilderness was quite excellent.  His evasion tactics were unpredictable. [I didn't see it coming].

I could see Sarah becoming his hostage and she did a good job of trekking through the mountain byways to a highway.

Tom Berenger has done many action/thriller movies, but Sidney Poitier steps out for a change of pace in this movie. Its formula is ""double-fish-out-of-water buddy picture"", and it stays pretty close to the formula throughout the movie.
Poitier plays an FBI agent who blew an arrest and wound up with a dead civilian, and has tracked the (unseen) thief/killer into the Pacific Northwest. Berenger plays a tracker, whose girlfriend runs a trail guide business. The girlfriend (Kirstie Alley in an outdoor role!) has taken her latest group of travelers out into the woods, and Poitier believes that the killer is among them. If that's not bad enough, a deadly storm looks like it's coming on.
The real fun in this movie is in the first half, where you see all of the men in Kirstie Alley's group. All of them are recognizable character actors, and most of them have played villains in other movies before. So which one of them is the killer? I guessed wrong the first time.
Unfortunately, this gets revealed about halfway through, and the movie returns to the formula. However, the excellent performances and lush cinematography elevate it beyond the norm. I thought Poitier did a great job as the city-based FBI agent, and Alley was surprisingly good as the trail guide.

Berenger also fares well as Poitier's antithesis, a rugged outdoorsman that assists the agent in his quest.  Kirstie Alley is also on hand as the unknown-to-her ""damsel in distress"".
However, it's Clancy Brown that is fittingly creepy as one of the members of the hunting party led by Alley.  His deep and resonant voice sends shudders up one's spine.
