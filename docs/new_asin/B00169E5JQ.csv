3155243,4,B00169E5JQ,"I watched this preview and was impressed with the concept. Following the lives of the glamorous and not so glamorous jobs and people on the carrier seems to work. I hope they live up to the preview, and I will watch this unfold on PBS.",1209772800,2,235,4.2444444444444445
3155244,5,B00169E5JQ,"I just finished watching ""Carrier"" on PBS and was extremely impressed by the honest, warts-and-all portrayal of life aboard a carrier.  The producers did an outstanding job providing compelling human-interest storylines and showing the diversity of attitudes among the sailors, airmen, and Marines regarding their military service.  The show captures the real ambivalence some have regarding our strategy on ""the war on terror"" and yet how they continue to serve professionally in fulfilling their duties.  What I most took away from the series was the exceptional sacrifices these military members make by serving long (monotonous) tours away from their families and from the remedial comforts of home that most of us take for granted.  ""Carrier"" puts a human face to the Navy and its personnel whose service is often performed out of sight of the American public. Kudos to PBS for airing this; to the show's producers for their painstaking work in piecing these individuals' stories together in such an informative and engaging manner; and mostly to the service members and their families who made this series possible.",1209686400,57,1121,5.280898876404494
3155245,5,B00169E5JQ,"I had alot of fun being in the show; It's been nearly three years now, so glad this has seen the light of day. Maro Chermayeff, Jeff Dupre, Matthew Akers are great!! -

3155246,5,B00169E5JQ,"Wow.  I have to say that the first 3 episodes really brought back the memories.  My first ship I was stationed on fresh out of boot was the USS America (CV66).  It was in dry dock in Norfolk.  It had just come back from a Westpac to Vietnam.  In thirty plus years, nothing has changed, with exception of women on board warships now days.  At sea, it was a 24/7 operation.  On a Med cruise, once the carrier left the pier in Norfolk, you never tied up at a pier again until you returned to the states.  Always anchored out, and the always enjoyable boat ride to the dock.  The constant cleaning, the enjoyable 3 months spent `mess cooking', and like they pointed out in the show, the ship was like a huge high school.  You had it all, from the jocks to the geeks and everything in between.  My personal favorite was the every three day refueling/resupply evolutions.  Just like clockwork, and for some strange reason, we did it around midnight every time. Top Gun was Hollywood, this is the real deal.",1209427200,21,1000,4.404371584699454
3155247,5,B00169E5JQ,"I came to this page to buy this item after seeing just 2 of the 10 episodes on PBS.  I love it so far- you can really try to put yourself in their place, and it is interesting to see how the discipline of the Navy influences each person.",1209427200,7,237,3.836734693877551
3155248,4,B00169E5JQ,"Owing to a childhood fascination, I've watched pretty much every documentary on carriers produced in the last ten years. A few of them have been Nat Geo productions, and the latest rounds play all the time on the Discovery Channel and the Military Channel. This series beats them all, hands down.

The problem with most documentaries on this subject--or virtually any 'mainstream' docu on military topics, is that the filmmakers get distracted by the whistles, bells, and blinking lights of all the technology. As a result, the documentary lens becomes clouded by all the 'gee-whiz' of the technology and machines. Granted, this sort of perspective has its place. What gets lost, or uncovered, however, is something far more compelling, and that's the human element. A carrier is, as the old saying goes, a city at sea, and it's the lives of the crew that make for real storytelling, not more of the same file footage of missile launches or facts about the latest blocks of the CIWS and the takeoff thrust of an F/A-18 at full military power.

This series focuses on the stories of the crew, and many of them are quite moving. It's hard not to get a lump in the throat when watching how hard these (predominantly) 18- and 19- year olds have to work in order to send aircraft over the bow, or how they're trying to meet the demands of family life from thousands of miles away at sea. Their personal struggles and hopes are the meat of this series.

Production values on this series are quite high. I met the producers at a sneak preview and found that they had shot over 3,000 hours of HD video over the course of a six-month deployment. Working over that time, and with a 17-member production and shooting team, they found the real stories in the nooks and crannies of the ship. The editing, which was done by a team, is also quite good, as is the music design. The net result is a series that has the look and feel of a modern reality series, without any of the sensationalism. In short, it's filmmaking by adults. The assistance of the Navy was also nothing short of remarkable--here on the series some of the characters speak openly about how hard their jobs are, or how they work with gay crewmembers, or how they don't understand the war they're supporting. This internal confliction and confusion, from the words of servicemen and women, makes for real storytelling and makes this  series worth recommending above any other on the same topic.",1209340800,125,2448,4.672853828306264
3155249,5,B00169E5JQ,"The first two hours have already proved to be pretty close to how real life is on a ship.  If anyone knows someone in the Navy and doesn't know what that someone does, I think this series will answer many untold stories.  It will reveal how event/uneventful life at sea away from family for 6 months really can be.",1209254400,18,314,4.305084745762712
3155250,5,B00169E5JQ,This is a great documentary of the lives of those on a carrier deployment.  I found it really interesting and it put a human side to what those sailors have to go through for 6 months at a time (or more!),1520812800,,204,3.975609756097561

3155262,2,B00169E5JQ,"This program does a great job in showing what life is like on an aircraft carrier. That's about where the good part ends and they probably could've gotten through that in 2 episodes. From the beginning (even the title music), they continually try to ram down your throat their own editorial opinion that the US shouldn't have been in the Gulf. They try to do it by interviewing the crew, letting the ones who agree with their viewpoint drone on mercilessly, and cutting short anyone who has an articulate point to the contrary. Unlike most PBS shows I remember from 20 or 30 years ago, there is very little factual or technical content in this show. The producers instead seem to prefer attempting (poorly, at that) to make a political point. The video quality is good (not excellent) and they stuck it out, seemingly taking footage from the entirety of a 6-month tour on the carrier. I would've been happier if they'd stuck to what they're good at, because they're not good changing the minds of viewers in the political arena.",1480291200,,1028,4.685082872928176

3155264,5,B00169E5JQ,"By now it's all been said......and yet I still feel compelled to put in my two cents. This is a very special documentary that offers an unvarnished view of the military service. I expected this to be the standard spin that I have seen in other docs of this type but it was not. What hooked me was the people, their candor, and their willingness to be vulnerable to the rest of the world. This is not a story about the Navy, nor is it a story about life in the service; it is a story about LIFE--the fun, the disappointments, the sacrifices, and the fact that it happens to all of us. They make so many movies these days that tug at our heart strings, but the stories aren't real; it's fiction. Made up. But Carrier is about REAL stories, about REAL people, with REAL stories to tell. Whether you agree or disagree with the way politicians run this country, you still have to admire the heart that people who serve our country have to do their jobs, even when they don't agree with their superiors. We can all learn from the folks portrayed in this film.",1476576000,,1053,4.3232323232323235

3155274,5,B00169E5JQ,"This is a close up and personal look at the lives and careers of our naval personnel deployed on an aircraft carrier.

3155278,3,B00169E5JQ,"This program had great possibilities but it was one interview after another, etc.  After awhile it gets boring listening to ""kids"" talk, complain, they are homesick and are suddenly finding their lives totally controlled!  LOL!  Interviews with more experienced crew members were not quite as boring.  This had good intentions but it many of these kids really would benefit and grow up.  Would I recommend this documentary, most likely not, unless you find entertainment is kids complaining about a structured life style on an air craft carrier.  It was interesting watching how the flight deck crews performed.  Ports of calls were drunken parties because alcohol is not allowed on ship.  Take my review as my opinion please and make your own informed decision on this series.",1466812800,,777,5.111111111111111

From shipping out to returning home, the story involves real people and their families as well as the camaraderie between the shipmates.  You are pulled in to one crewman's worries about a girlfriend he had to leave behind.  She's not calling or emailing him.  He's worried she's found someone else.  A pilot misses the ""drink cup"" at then end of the refueling tanker's tube and barely gets back aboard.

3155335,5,B00169E5JQ,"A refreshing view about life on board a US Navy Carrier. Totally non-scripted. Interesting to hear the various crews opinions of life on board ship and even shore leave.  Covers from the basic seaman/airman to officers,  from lowly cooks to flight crews. How  its basically, one big floating city thats a front line in todays world on terrorism. Yes, there is some cursing, griping from the crew members, thats to be expected.  Life in the Navy isn't a bed of roses. its hard work, dirty work and even risk to ones life if not careful. But it was fun seeing how the crew takes liberty when in Hong Hong and Hawaii. But the show is worth watching, especially those looking at possible life in the Navy, especially on board a Carrier.

It would be interesting for the producers to do life on board a Submarine  and a different capital ship like a destoyer or frigate.",1463529600,2,865,4.548387096774194

We had it good compared to the hard hours at sea-our flight quarters started at 4am and ended at 2300 hours, and when we were in the MED, every third night starting at 2230 until 0530 we were along side an AO taking on NSFO and Jp5, avgas..that was on top of a regular work day, watches not with standing.

I decided to look it up later that night and then proceed to watch the whole series in the following 24 hours. I loved that it gave you a raw and real look into the people on the ship, as opposed to the ships lay out or weapons. Much of what the people have to say was through provoking and made you almost reexamine some of your oven beliefs. The only thing that disrupted the flow of this awesome series was the amount of repeat footage.. I will say that it was probably more noticeable to me than it would be for some one who watched the show spread across a longer period of time.

But, as a Navy veteran, (70's era) who spent many long months at sea, I am surprised at the attitude of the ""kids"" in the military these days.  This is not a reflection on the film, but it did affect my attitude towards continuing to watch it.  Several times I just had to shut it off and wait for my attitude to clear.

People started to introduce themselves that we already met, it was like the director did not trust the audience to remember anyone, it was sort of insulting.

It is one of the most dangerous  jobs in the Navy and the hard working dedicated men and women working there deserve a lot more credit for the success of every deployment.",1454544000,,484,4.355555555555555

From this series I learned
1. Choose a job that will let you work in the ac on the carrier.
2. Expect a lot of pressure on keeping a happy personal relationship with a boyfriend or girlfriend.
3. You will be taken advantage of.
What I mean is that on the third episode that discusses relationships...heterosexual relationships are punished and Homosexual relationships are encouraged.  It was interesting that the girl airmen had to write word essays for their punishment for having a intimate relationship with a male ship mate but the men ship mate would be punished with lower pay.  Its almost as if upper management or senior officers were using the women to go around and lower the mens pay as punishment.  If the senior officers wanted to put a stop to such heterosexual relationships then they would severely punish the women and not make them write word essays.  The ship has a ratio of one woman to seven men.  More women cant be placed on the ship?  The homosexual relationships were treated by senior officers as a don't ask and don't tell policy.  The rational for discouraging heterosexual relationships is that if they go sour then it can cause drama in the work environment.  This rationale totally ignores the higher chance of relationship violence that take place in homosexual relationships.  Law enforcement has known this for years of a higher rate of violence in homosexual relationships.  In fact one of Jeffery Dahmers victims escaped and found a police officer and told the police officer he was trying to kill him but as soon as Dahmer explained that they were gay and that they were having a lovers fight the officer dismissed the victims claims.  I was also surprised by witch craft being allowed on board from eppisode 8",1442707200,,1850,4.786163522012578

3155721,5,B00169E5JQ,I absolutely LOVED this series. I have looked at it completely maybe three times. Its the only series to provide real day to day details on all levels of life on an aircraft carrier. I felt like I knew some of the people when it was all done. I also learned a lot about some of the jobs onboard.,1426636800,,295,4.016949152542373

3155724,5,B00169E5JQ,"This 10-part series follows the nuke powered aircraft carrier, Nimitz, through a six-month cruise to the Persian Gulf during the Iraq war. While it covers things generally, it keys in on about a dozen personnel, from pilots in the flight squadron to lowly deck apes, and follows their trials and tribulations during the lengthy time at sea. It's interesting to note that the operations included 1,167 combat sorties over Iraq and yet the squadron dropped not one piece of ordnance; a hell of a waste of fuel. Another thing that became clear to an old former swab is that, while the modern Navy is different in many ways (email, telephones, televisions, game consoles?) there's still a lot of griping and bitching and ""I don't wanna be here"" from the lower echelons of the food chain. Most former servicemen know someone who got ""Dear Johned"" and we get to see a young aviation E-3 who has a pregnant girlfriend back in San Diego whose emails dwindle down to nothing over a period of time; it's amazing that the viewer can figure out so effortlessly what's going on, but the little sob-sister victim of this situation can't seem to wrap his head around the idea that any woman wouldn't swoon at the sight of him. Back in port and home, he gets the straight scoop from the gal. And of course, he weeps some more. This is well worth the look if you ever wondered what goes on on these floating cities of 5,500 souls.",1426291200,3,1413,4.58893280632411
3155725,5,B00169E5JQ,"This is a great view into the workings and the people who served in the Navy during the first Gulf War. They do not all agree on why they are doing what they are doing, how they are doing it but they do their jobs under amazing pressure. Some of these sailors (and airmen/women) are still teenagers and all are very young. What they do is beyond amazing!

Living on a ship is hard during normal times, being that far from home gives a whole new set of issues to our service members. This video is wonderfully shot and directed. A must watch for any young person considering serving on a Navy carrier ship.",1426032000,,605,4.307017543859649

Then I realized, that's what it's like on a carrier; the highs, the lows and the long days in between. It felt that this show was faithful to it's subject without over glamorizing or deprecating it. From the highest ranks to the lowest E1 airman, a good view into the life of the people who put their lives on the line for their fellow citizens aboard the USS Nimitz. Soundtrack is not bad either.",1422230400,,497,4.413043478260869

3155740,2,B00169E5JQ,"The Navy gave the producers of this series remarkable access to the USS Nimitz and the results are often terrific. Ship and jet fanciers will love the creative video especially, but the chronicles of life aboard ship are uneven. It is definitely not a recruiter's dream show as a number of those interviewed decry their decisions to join up while others complain about the way the higher-ups treat them.
Carrier gets two out of five stars from me for a couple of reasons. I think the show runners could have accomplished more with fewer episodes . . . though the network probably ordered ten to fill out the season. As a result, the latter episodes seem padded and spend far too much time with a couple of individuals whose stories just aren't that compelling. A young airman with a pregnant girlfriend back home worries endlessly why she sounds so strange on the phone and isn't emailing him as much as he'd like. After listening to him whine through five or so episodes, I was surprised his shipmates hadn't cast him adrift. Another crew member brags through two episodes that he's a racist and wants the Navy to discharge him. His smarmy attitude and clueless laughter kept me fast forwarding.
Five stars for the stunning video, three for overall content, three for the cinema-veritae style which gets tiresome after awhile, and two for a soundtrack that sounds like it was written by a Top Gun music creator-wannabe and just never stays far enough in the background.
Bottom line...life aboard an aircraft carrier gets monotonous. Sadly, so does the video series Carrier.",1420329600,,1574,4.833333333333333

Unlike the many shows that show 45 minutes of aircraft and pilots in 45 minutes, this series focuses on the young men and women who do the critical and unappreciated jobs most never discuss.

I thought it was sad that one young man was discharged due to he being racist toward an Negro American. It is sad that even to this day there are people who are racist in American because his Parents were. Does he not know he has a choice and need not carry this prejudice forward to another generation. When you consider how awful the Negroes were treated in history. Stolen from their home land to be slaves to the Southern States and their plantations.

3155777,5,B00169E5JQ,Really loved this series. It gives you an in depth look into the lives of the men and women serving our country while on deployment on a carrier. It's amazing to see how roughly 2000 people living on the carrier come together to make it a floating city. It's defiantly worth spending time to watch it!! I wish it was more than just one season.,1411257600,,343,4.292307692307692

3155779,5,B00169E5JQ,Thought-provoking documentary into what it is like to serve in an entry level position on an aircraft carrier. Explores the socio-economic backgrounds and life experiences of these young men and women. Interesting exploration of race and gender issues in the military and the need to follow orders without necessarily having a context or full picture as to the objective or purpose of an assigned task. Explores the camaraderie and life skills learned by these young people without romanticizing the experience.,1410998400,,511,5.4

3155781,4,B00169E5JQ,"I really enjoyed this series because of its openness and authenticity. I have always been fascinated by carriers and naval aviation, but this series showed that there is so much more on a personal level than just shooting and recovering aircraft. The personal toll of being away was something I imagined when thinking about a carrier cruise before, but this series really brought it home. Really heartbreaking at times. The other thing that impressed me was the character of our service people who are just like us but who are trying to build a better life for themselves. This series made me feel like I was on the cruise as part of the crew. Whether you enjoy military stories or not, you should watch this. Because it is really a human story more than anything else.",1410393600,,769,4.661764705882353

Each episode was very interesting portraying the lives and jobs of the servicemen who keep the USS Nimitz running and protecting our country. An aircraft carrier is an awesome military weapon. This is a very informative series and I was sorry that there were only 9 episodes. Am looking forward to watching more quality programs from PBS. I've watched many videos streamed from Amazon on my Kindle Fire. A quality set of small Bose earphones helps when viewing in the early AM hours to not disturb others who are still sleeping.

It seems to be an honest portrayal of the repetitiveness of their days, their loneliness for their families, and the hardships they endure in their lives.  It interviews people from the Captain down to the people who work in the garbage area.  How fortunate we are to have them defending us.  Thank you to all active duty military and veterans!

3155811,5,B00169E5JQ,"Life aboard any Navy ship is structured and regimented but that is upped on a Super Carrier.  This show takes you inside the belly of the beast, into all those hidden nooks and crannies where the majority of the 5000 man and woman crew live and work.  Of special interest is the level of access granted the film crew for the entire deployment and the candor of individual crew members  on any and all subject not classified; sex, racism, drudgery, cramped living space and perceived unreasonable demands.  But also shown is the bond those working in each area have for each other, the mentoring and acts of understanding and support given.  Time is also spent on the mission of the carrier and the cost on family life back home.  The average age of those serving is between 18-20 so the majority of the crew treat their circumstance as an extension of high school and some view it as a form of prison.  Not lost in translation is that democracy can't be practiced on a warship and the mission is projection of force and sometimes combat; life aboard a super carrier is not a game; it is deadly serious.",1403308800,,1102,4.5353535353535355

3155823,5,B00169E5JQ,"This documentary took place around 2004. My ship the Stennis relived the Nimitz.
I worked in the engineering department (catapults), our department provided the steam pressure (accumulator) for the green shirts (catapults aviation) and yes they work about 15 hours a day if they are lucky. They work all of flight ops, and in down time, they have to grease the cables. I felt sorry for them. Never join the Navy as an un-designated airmen because that is where they probably would place you if you are assign on a ship.
Aviation ordnance have it a little better. Large staff which provides a little bit more down time.
I worked 2 years in the catapults department of an aircraft carrier and 2 years as an aviation mechanic. While deployed, aviation mechanic work about 13 hour shifts that is if there is no training. Aviation ordnance have it about the same.

My comment is that the United States Navy, or somebody in decision making power there had to be dead crazy to allow this to be made in the first place. If you are considering a career in the Navy you better steer clear because in the two episodes I have seen on public TV there is scarcely a single positive moment. As a dramatic critique there is no focus whatsoever. Seemingly random footage and events stitched together by someone with no concept of film making. Exposition, denouement, resolution and other components of stage and screen are no more than words in a dictionary to whomever created this excuse for a documentary. Camera work and editing are equally suspect.

3155864,5,B00169E5JQ,"This is a great series (more of a documentary) for those wanting to get a feel for military service, in particular life on a Navy carrier. The director does a nice job portraying various situations and often presents multiple perspectives from across the ranks. Surprise - not every member of the crew is a happy camper. A few four letter words creep into the dialog but most scenes are family friendly. A well chosen sound track enriches the material and reinforces the day to day (mundane) rituals that define a typical tour of duty. Those seeking dog fights and intense combat scenes should look elsewhere. Over time you begin to connect with several service men/women and realize what a huge personal sacrifice they make to keep the rest of us safe.",1378252800,,753,4.755725190839694

I don't care about punks' laundry and personal relationships and how they miss mommy and daddy.

The series is a rare look into the culture aboard an aircraft carrrier -- a sort of microcosm where people are forced to interact and make things happen whether they like it or not, whether they like each other or not. I loved the approach to the whole series, the questions they raise, stories of the people aboard which allowed us to look beyond the military veneer. But, it needs to be remembered, this deployment did happen for a reason and sometimes the story seemed to divert the viewers' attention to personal aspects of the crew rather than the big political picture. What I was most impressed with was with the narrative skill of how the various stories were put together in different episodes, and how it was visually mastered with the stunning editing craftsmanship.

3155897,5,B00169E5JQ,"This documentary is one of the best I have seen. It is simply high quality thought provoking television. As others have said it is in no way an ad for the Navy in fact I was surprised at just how critical many of the sailors were with regards to the Navy. At one point, they show a sailor lugging around some ridiculous industrial incarnation of pre-made food and she talks about how the recruiter told her the Navy has an excellent culinary program. Reminds of when my art student college roommate told me the recruiter said they have people that paint tanks! The series is a very interesting  insight into the people on the ship not the ship. There are a few lines about the engine's horsepower but generally this is about people, my wife was surprised at how watchable it was for her. Obviously there are political implications but the series itself is not political. For me, one of the most interesting aspects of the series was the degree to which work is segregated and the degree to which the soldiers are detached from the potential killing. This person maintains the bombs, this person transports them to the plane, this person arms them, the pilot doesn't even really decide to drop them or not. Finally, I noticed some reviews talking about the frat boy antics of the pilots. I was equally turned off by those parts but think they are none-the-less an important part of the series. I don't think the series did anything to infer that their behavior was good or bad they just showed it. For me, it was disappointing to see that the pilots in charge of the air wing were both of the mindset that: everything is black and white (direct quote). I wondered several times whether these zealous pilots still speak so adoringly about doing the President's bidding since the 2008 election. Whereas the pilots who were no less dutiful soldiers but had a more nuanced view on killing people were somewhat ostracized. The commander of the air wing explains why another pilot is not really part of the group by referring to him with a telling chuckle as a ""blue guy."" I'm just sharing these little tidbits about the series to indicate some of the internal moral conversations this series evokes. If you watch this with an open mind you will reinforce some of your preconceived notions but change some too.",1363219200,,2303,4.644607843137255
3155898,5,B00169E5JQ,"Many years ago, I recall catching a few episodes of this series, because I remembered certain parts as I went through the entire series this time.

3155899,4,B00169E5JQ,Having spent 10 years in the military (and I did like the experience) this is the first series I have seen that really shows the day to day life of a sailor. I gave it 4 stars because it is a bit slow moving.,1362787200,,208,3.75
3155900,5,B00169E5JQ,"I (husband of the owner of this Amazon account) spent four years in the Navy, much of that time aboard two ships. While my ships were much smaller than the Nimitz this program still brought me back to those Navy days. I think the production crew did a great job of showing life aboard the carrier. I was so pleased with the series that I actually watched it a second time after a two year break from the first watching.

I wish a different view could have been exposed of life aboard the ship though. This series seemed to heavily focus on the lower level of jobs aboard the ship. Mentions were made of the middle level jobs such as radar operators, communications technicians, and other jobs, but the series painted too bleak a picture of ship life.

My experience was much better as I was an Electronics Technician on a ship with a crew of about 250 men. I only mention this so others who watch this series doesn't get a tainted picture of the Navy. My personal experience led to a lifelong career that I fully credit to my Navy schooling. It also left me with a love for the sea and many happy years sailing, SCUBA diving, and jet skiing on the ocean.

The many shots of carrier take-offs and landings were great too. I highly recommend this series. For those who have had no military exposure this is also a great way to see the way our tax dollars are used to protect our country.

3155904,5,B00169E5JQ,I've thoroughly enjoyed the look inside the Navy that this series provides. It takes you below the deck of the USS Nimitz for a look at day-to-day operations while on a 6-month deployment. Getting to know the people gives you much greater respect for any man or woman in uniform and the struggles they go through at sea and back home. Enjoyed every minute of this.,1354924800,,364,4.53030303030303
3155905,5,B00169E5JQ,"My husband brought this DVD home from the library; not our usual fare but it was an Emmy award winner and he had an idle interest in how aircraft carriers work, technically.  I didn't expect to watch it at all, suspected it of being war propaganda. We belong to the 50% of the population who would like to see the GWOT finish and the troops come home.  But then the quality of the soundtrack and the production enticed me to perch for a few minutes.  One thing led to another, which I do not regret in the least.

At first we intended to watch only a couple of episodes.  Then we got hooked.  We realized we would be watching the entire thing, so we might as well settle in comfortably for the duration.  We watched 2 episodes per evening, every evening, which is about the right balance.  Any more than that and you would be complaining like some of these user reviewers do about ""tedious"", any less frequently you would lose the various story lines.  And there are issues raised in each episode that you want to give yourself the opportunity to think over and discuss.

The soundtrack was very, very good, and it is all original music composed specifically for the documentary.  I thought of buying it as a music CD but it turns out there is none available.

The high points of the documentary were the shots of the planes taking off and landing on the flight deck, the pilots attended by the choreographed body signals of the ground crew airmen.  Those must have been the shots which won the Emmy for cinematography.  Those scenes were unforgettable.

Then in episode 8 came the dramatic climax of the film, something which was more exciting than any fictional ""action adventure"" scene in any Hollywood blockbuster; this was real and it happened in real time over several hours, day giving way to night  --  the storm at sea, in the open ocean 700 miles from land, and the planes in the air unable to land on the pitching flight deck of the carrier.  Landing elsewhere was not an option  --  they didn't carry enough fuel to make an emergency landing on a conventional airstrip.  The hours passed, plane after plane coming in for a landing and unable to land, forced off the carrier.  Night falling making the whole thing even worse, reduced visibility adding to the problems on the pitching flight deck. They sent out a small tanker airplane, finally, expecting that the fruitlessly circling fighter jets would run out of fuel before they could successfully land.  At this point the intrepid squadron commander, a grizzled veteran ready for retirement, pulled rank and took the tanker plane out himself, bumping the less experienced aviator who had been assigned.

It had me sitting on the edge of my seat, that episode.  Incredibly well filmed, and the soundtrack was brilliant during this dramatic interlude.  Two days later it came to me that perhaps, just perhaps, the captain had shown poor judgement in ordering the planes aloft in such conditions  --  if so, there was no reprimand shown in the film.  His explanation that the training of the aviators needed to be kept up was accepted without question.  Yet there was an enormous stink raised over an aviator who was unable to connect with a mid-air tanker refueling during a training exercise in the Gulf and had to make an emergency landing (successful) at the Baghdad International Airport.  And an even bigger stink over a sexual encounter (consensual)between two carrier staff (male and female) while they were on shore leave.  Sometimes military culture is quite perplexing, as the film demonstrated.

I did come away with an enhanced appreciation for the military as an important social institution of American culture.  It is a family for those without one, it is a sanctuary for those fleeing from inner city gang violence, it offers status to those who would otherwise have none.  It stands in lieu of college, for those who are not going to college; it is a broadening and educational and positive experience for young people just out of high school. It acts as a finishing school for people who are not quite grown up.  It grows them up, usually safely, unless there is a war going on.  If only it didn't go to war so often I would like the military a lot more, but I guess there is the downside to everything...  The young enlisted men and women were very endearing over the course of the film.  We wonder what happened to them, and we wish them well.",1343692800,,4426,4.661935483870968

I can see why some ex-military don't like the series which includes some service personnel less than perfect in attitude and maturity but that's some of the younger generation isn't it? I'm a college teacher and see it too.
At the same time, probably too much time spent on individuals and redundancy concerning pilots flying off and on the ship. Balanced commentary on how individuals see their mission....some express doubt that a carrier is even needed in our kind of war today; others just say they trust the higher ups to make decisions and it's their duty to carry it out without skepticism.  The downtime at various ports are interesting. I liked one of the final discs dealing with a session on adjusting back to civilian life.

It's basically a video scrapbook of life on a carrier and the people on it. There is no form or structure of traditional storytelling. This production is really a collage of experiences. If one understands and can accept this, one can probably understand why this series may feel slightly loose and aimless. But such is the nature of a photo album (in this instance, a video album). You are simply looking at different pages (episodes) and enjoying each one for what it is. Can be enjoyable for folks who appreciate the military life. And can be an uncompromisingly blunt view for folks who have no concept of or experience with it. Would not call it an infomercial, or even a recruiting commercial, since there is no RAH RAH SIS BOOM BAH ""marching band"" style patriotism. It's honest in presenting the positives and negatives of life in the navy. You, the viewer, are left to judge for yourself what the issues are to consider.",1306454400,,1215,4.699530516431925
3155914,3,B00169E5JQ,"I think this is a weak version of what could have been great. I like the format of it, but I think 1/2 of each episode could have been edited. It just seems slow and bloated.",1300492800,,174,3.861111111111111

3155916,4,B00169E5JQ,"This documentry is a bit like a Reality Show.  Still, it is effective in providing a portrait of what motivates US Navy Personnel today.  Perhaps overly long at 10 episodes, the length of the series does give some ideal of the monotonous nature of modern naval service.  The Carrier USS Nimitz seems to provide a modern US Gunboat diplomacy for our gov.  Why this is necessary is never quite explained, although some of the crew do question what the purpose of their mission is.  The Carrier seems to bounce around various potential trouble spots, while pulling in for various ports of call to amuse the crew and provide some needed diversion.  All of this would seem to be very expensive for today's US tax payer!

At length the ship arrives off the Persian Gulf to provide back-up for on-going sundry operations against Insurgents in Iraq.  Again, it seems excessive to have such a powerful vessle supporting various small unit actions on the ground.  In fact the Nimitz F-16s are never called upon once to provide direct ground support and spend most of their time hovering overhead.  Again, a huge waste of money.  In fact ths mis-placed use of the Nimitz serves as a mirror for virtually the whole Iraqi operation.  Presumptiously called Op Iraqi Freedom.  The Freedom remains an open question to this day.  Still, the majority of the crew seem to feel they are doing right in their mission and one can't help admiring their trust in the system.

In looking at this series one can see that the navy is different things for different people.  On the upper level are the officers and highly trained navy pilots who seem to get the most out of the service.  On the lower level are the younger members of the crew providing various grunt work to support the whole effort.  For many of these kids the navy is a stop-gap for what could be a far worse life on the streets of urban America.  The service provides a degree of stability and discipline that many American youth lack and desperately need.

While a bit preechy at times, and venturing a bit into Realty TV realms, this series is none the less a fascianting look at today's US navy and the crew who make it work.  The 5,000 souls on the USS Nimitz each have a story to tell.",1299110400,,2232,4.571788413098237

A lot of the stuff that was portrayed in this film is real to the core how it is on a naval vessel.  I've never done a tour on a carrier before but this was def worth the watch.  As a lot of people say about the cussing all through the film, I'm pretty sure it says VIEWER DISCRETION ADVISED for language plus the language hasn't changed since WWII much either (grand dad was a sailor in WWII, I've heard the stories) so ""old timers"" have no place to criticize.

This series is absolutely fascinating. The Navy is my ""favorite"" branch of the service - my Dad served on the USS Midway, and I was baptized on the ship. You could say I have a from-the-cradle loyalty to the Navy ;-)

It's so intriguing to watch the inner workings of a deployment & life on an aircraft carrier. We are privy to the personal stories of select crew members, the ups and downs of life both at home and at sea for each of them. I got really involved in what was going on for some of these folks. I saw that someone mentioned they'd like a follow-up on the sailors - I would too. Just 10 episodes, but they get in-depth and it just draws you in.

I think this is a magnificent documentary/""reality"" series. I spent 600 minutes over the course of a week watching each episode, and don't regret a minute of the time spent.

The young people especially are so impressive. Those of us who are used to seeing 18 year-olds hanging out at the mall and texting and gossiping will appreciate what those kids could be if given the opportunity. The level of responsibility these people have is amazing. I can't say enough about this film. People who are not familiar with the military would do well to watch it, because it does an excellent job of showing what the military culture is all about. It's really inspiring, and not just in a rah-rah-rah patriotic way, but more in just a human way. It would be great if at some point the same production crew would do a similar film on the Army or Marine Corps. It would be great for the American people to see what their military is doing and to see the extraordinary work these people do. Two thumbs up.",1251936000,,1135,4.596059113300493

Having been there, I can tell you that NONE of that hardware would go ANYWHERE without the people who make it happen.

I've always been interested in the Navy.  I come from a Navy town and several members of my family were either in the Navy or were civilians working building ships in the Navy Yard.  I didn't really know what went on board an aircraft carrier until I saw this program.  I found the stories of the regular crewman pretty interesting.  They work 16-18 hours a day, then try to sleep in a tiny bunk separated from the corridor with a little curtain, all while planes are landing overhead every couple of minutes.  And if you work on the flight deck in the Middle East, it's 130 degrees while you're wearing a long-sleeve turtleneck and a nylon vest. I didn't find the stories of the pilots to be as interesting and think too much time was spent on their frat-house antics.

I think the Navy is to be commended for the frankness of this program.  Even something shocking like the sexual assault prevention officer being suspected of rape wasn't whitewashed at all.  Those interviewed gave their opinion, good and bad, of their mission.  Even on the topic of 'don't ask, don't tell', I was surprised how near some sailors came to admitting being gay.  And for those who complained about the swearing: they are SAILORS.  Have you ever heard the expression 'swear like a sailor'?

On the downside, there was too much time spent on one particular sailor whose pregnant girlfriend was obviously giving him the brushoff for the entire 10 episodes.  I felt bad for the guy, but by the 3rd episode, I was yelling at the TV for him to get a clue.  The other thing that got a little tiresome were the little 'music videos' interspersed.  Most of the music was good, but they just went on too long and there were too many of them.",1238112000,4,1890,4.495601173020527

They told many interesting back stories about people's lives before joining the Navy.  Although lots of people on the show complained about their navy job (as many civilians also do), it seemed like the navy pulled many of these folks from messed up family and life situations and provided needed structure.

The carrier technology and the planes technology is fascinating - but the constant usage of very graphic language throughout - ruined it.  I could only make it through the first couple of segments before returning it - which I promptly did.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  It's not a cuss word here and there - it's constant vulgarity and disrespect to authority.  Maybe I am old fashioned but if you don't like being on a ship and can do nothing but swear about your superior officers when they're not around - don't join the Navy.

If you want a bunch of pompus officers sitting there spitting out the same talking points you can hear again and again then this isn't the documentary for you.  However, if you want an honest uncensored look at what is like on a deployment then this is what you want to watch.
You see the good and the bad.  The Sailors drawing strength from each other as days turn into weeks and then months.  You see how crap really does roll down hill as far as things not being the way they should be.

Many of those younger folks in the military do as little as possible and get mad when they are told to do something right.

  After watching these ten hours, I consider every member of the Nimitz crew one of my blessings as an American.

  At first I was disappointed. I was expecting and hoping for a detailed viewing of the ship itself, its airplanes and all the gizmos that make the marvel of technology work. Instead the ten hours focused on the people, the crew from the guy who mopped the floors to the men and women flying aircraft into combat zones, the deck crew, the cooks, the hundreds of occupations it takes to make this colossus function.

  Above all, I am surprised that this was on PBS: it wasn't anti-war, anti-American, didn't celebrate left-wing dictators. It was a paean to the United States of America in it is wonderful.

  Little time (unfortunately in a way) is spent on the ship and its operations. Most of the time is spent in interviews and voiceovers with the crew. It is stunning that so many of the crew are so young. Teenagers or barely out of their teens. Many tell the stories of their short lives, stories they freely admit could have turned out horribly. Kids moving down the wrong paths in life - and entering the Navy helped them straighten out their lives.

  There are personal stories of how some of these people go off on a months long deployment, leaving families and loved ones behind with sometimes hurtful circumstances. How do you react when your wife miscarries while you are thousands of miles away in the Arabian Gulf? Your pregnant girlfriend doesn't communicate with you. Your divorced spouse is fighting with you over the custody of the kids and won't send you photographs of your youngest child's first day at school.

  And yet these people serve. They do their jobs for their nation and for their families: their real families and their Navy family.

  There are so many stories in ""Carrier"", not a one of which ultimately comes up empty or trite. The directors and editors have done their job extremely well. The story that ultimately comes across is not of the ship itself, but of these heroes - yes, they are heroes - who serve their country.

  As the Admiral says ""Count your blessings as Americans"". The more than 5,000 crew members profiled in ""Carrier"" are indeed blessings to the United States of America. This is a wonderful production.

3155956,5,B00169E5JQ,"This was a VERY comprehensive documentary that accurately depicted everyday life aboard a U.S. Navy nuclear aircraft carrier, the USS Nimitz, CVN-68.  It was gratifying to me personally because I served four years on active duty aboard another nuclear carrier, the USS Enterprise back in the 70s.

Unfortunately, I could not relate as much to this documentary because it did not delve into the Nuclear Propulsion areas of the work done by those crewmembers aboard such ships.  I guess the Navy has not yet seen fit to declassify such shipboard operations.  However, I don't know why as the reactors aboard the Nimitz are based on over 50 year old designs.

Those guys who work with the Nuclear propulsion equipment are a special breed, aka ""Nukes"".  They work down in the engine rooms, far below decks, deep down in the bowels of the ship.  They have completed a year or more of highly technical training in order to qualify as Rx Operators.  These sailors are some of the most educated people in the Navy, both as officers and Enlisted.  They are hardly the nerdish types while serving in the Navy but often can be seen to glow in the dark.  j/k

The rest of crew was well covered in this documentary.  The reoccurring storyline of various crewmembers, including some of the officers, dealing with family separation issues was very well done.  In this regard, Navy life oboard ship on overseas deployments, has not changed much since my days in the Navy.  It is still quite monotonous, arduous work, and emotionally challenging to be away from your loved ones back home.

The full ten hours of this documentary held my interest and some episodes I felt compelled to watch twice!  Whenever any ""documentary"" can do that, it deserves FIVE STARS.

Kudos to the producers of CARRIER for making such an honest, personal introspective of the Navy, that is both educational AND heart wrenching.  Most of all ""thanks"" to all the men and women serving in the U.S. Armed Forces protecting our country and helping to keep all Americans safe and free.",1212796800,5,2040,4.796561604584527
3155957,4,B00169E5JQ,"This was a well made series.  The producers tried to cover different areas of the Carrier life.  I understand the story line, because I was stationed aboard the USS Nimitz, when I was in the Navy from 94-98.  The only problem I have with this video is that they spend too much time with people who are not satisfied with Navy or carrier life, or have other issues going on.  There should have been more time spent with sailors who enjoyed the Navy/carrier life.  I enjoyed my time aboard the USS Nimitz, even though I was only apart of the air wing.  That is the only complaint I have about the video.  Overall though, it was a great series to watch and I would recommend it.",1212624000,8,675,4.309523809523809
3155958,1,B00169E5JQ,"I've watched several episodes of the PBS mini-series Carrier and, I think the production was unfortunate and a huge mistake by The Navy.

On the other hand, there's also some evidence to support the remark by one lower-level sailor that it's ""a big-a- floating high school."" The unusually candid and personal portrait of life aboard the Nimitz should have been taken more seriously.

Since this program focuses on the reality tv approach its material  does not always and fully represent the discipline, values and mission of the Naval service.",1212364800,6,544,5.089887640449438

I felt as if I actually knew these young people and gained a new understanding of the sacrifices they make in service to our country. 10 engaging hours. Beautiful music and spectacular photography. This is not a recruiting poster for the Navy or the Marines, but rather an honest look at life aboard a U.S. aircraft carrier on deployment. I highly recommend it.",1212364800,,728,4.785714285714286

My beloved Godfather Bart, was tragically killed flying his jet in take off. As a kid, I use to go aboard anchored carriers for visits and dinners.  ""Carrier"" represents the passion, glory, trenches, camaraderie, honors and disciplines of each person aboard. It follows each crew member in exclusive, unique jobs, who does them and why.  Protocols, secrets, parties, missions, danger, hazards.  Men and women working side-by-side in closed conditions with opposing politics.  Women in high ranks.  Races, religions and sexual orientations living tightly.  If you know everything about the Navy, you'll love this.  Flying on the ball? You'll see what that's all about. Never before has a documentary been made of this exacting detail. If you served in the Navy, you must see this. Your keen mind will never observe a repetitive scene.  We pay for the boat, we should see the boat.  Every sailor ends their duty with either of two things: maturity and knowledge of what they want or  don't want to do with their life.

3155971,5,B00169E5JQ,"This series is more than learing about navy carriers and how life evolves during a deployment,  This series is a lesson on life itself.  To concentrate on the mechanics of ship and its deployment is only a backdrop for the human element which is coming to terms with the formulation of so many of life's lessons, racial prejudice, discipline, patriotism, rightousness of war, excellence in performance no matter what the job.  Learning all of these things when the ship is described as a floating high schoolis truly amazing.  But, perhaps most heart rendering is the real notion that many aboard have this probable one chance to grab hold of their life and make it count for something bigger than them- the realization that one can be a part of something bigger than themselves and feel good about it. Does anyone think that the sailor that left the ship because he could or would not deal with his racism and learn from it is headed to anything in life that won't haunt him over and over again? To see that happen regardless of how you feel about their mission is truly heart breaking and inspriring at the same time.",1211760000,2,1119,4.636363636363637

3155973,5,B00169E5JQ,"Serving under worst conditions (USS Kitty Hawk CV-63)than the Nimitz, I must say that this documentry has to be the absolute best portrayal of what life is like on an aircraft carrier. Yeah, maybe there was too much focus on just a few of the 5000 ships company and air wing crew members (as mentioned from one of the reviews)... but i'm gonna tell you it only a few people to describe what life is like on a aircraft carrier...it doesn't take all 5000 sailors and marines to tell you what its like. In other words, the director showed enough people do give a full perspective of what life is like on a carrier. Take it from me... I can relate to all of the feelings and opinions that was expressed on the show. On that note, I am very surprised that the Navy allowed that much exposure to be revealed to the public. Usually, they hide this exposure and allow camera crews to look at all the ""good"" aspects of being on a boat (I forgot the name of that show on Discovery which showed how good life is like on the Reagan..and I hear life sucks more on that ship than the Nimitz or even the Kitty Hawk). I am glad that this show was made though. My family now knows the sacrifice, the commitment and the stress that people like myself go through on a daily basis. Anyway: Bravo PBS! I highly recommend this show to anyone who is thinking of joining the Navy... This show puts perspective on the kinds of people you'll meet..all the ups and downs..and opinions of such.

On a side note: the Nimitz and CAG 11 are very lucky that they go on cruise at 18 month (excluding Surge cruises and/crisis) intervals. Kitty Hawk and CAG 5 (aka: me) deploy twice a year. Maybe PBS should've went to Japan and filmed us for a whole year. Now that would be a show!",1211500800,6,1747,4.293939393939394

3155975,5,B00169E5JQ,"My wife's name may appear as the author of this review.

I was on the maiden cruise for the Nimitz back in 1975, a NATO cruise to the North Atlantic following workups in the Caribbean.  I was then on the first full Med cruise in 1976.

Much has changed aboard the ship, and yet so much is still the same.  The mess deck (chow hall) looks a lot nicer, the workout area far exceeds the dinky gym we had, there is no comparison to our little stores and what is there now, and of course no phone calls or email.  And most notably, no women.

But beyond that I felt like I could nearly recognize many of the sailors and marines portrayed in the show.  The same kind of emotions, doubts, enthusiasm, and bonehead actions were there 30 years ago as are there now.  The documentary did a wonderful job of showing what life on a carrier is like.

And that seemed to be the point of the show.  There are other documentaries, many of which get rather boring, that go through and talk about all the technical aspects of a carrier, but you get the feeling the people there are just a highly evolved ant taking care of the machine.  This documentary showed the people and how it is a microcosm of America.  Very rightly so we often referred to it as the small town of Nimitz, Virginia.

I look forward to passing this DVD set on to my daughter and her family so they can see where I spent a year and change and understand a bit of what my life was like.

3155978,2,B00169E5JQ,"Carrier is a well produced DVD - no question.

The problem, as I see it, is that there is far too much repetition and far, far, too much extraneous material. The endless 'interviews'  with - mostly - the same individuals fails to provide a true overall picture of the thinking of the crew - which numbered over 5,000 souls.

Far to many of those interviewed made me, personally, ashamed to be proud of a Navy and seriously doubtful whether some of the crew of this vast Carrier would perform adequately in times of a 'real' war. The tremendous naivety of more than a few crew members was compounded by the demonstrated ignorance of 'normal' everyday life and living. In this, it must be stressed, it was largely the 'lower deck' and younger crew members who caused this perspective to become most evident. The Officers and Senior Ranks certainly appeared a much better educated and cosmopolitan group of individuals.

The whole programme could have been contained, without loss of interesting or important comment, in a three hour - maximum four hour - programme/DVD.

The actual working life of those aboard was very interesting - but seriously curtailed.

Sadly, for I was keenly anticipating viewing the DVD, I found myself glad it was over!  2 stars out of 5 is the maximum I can, with any conscious, accord this DVD.

Incidentally, the BBC did a similar programme some 30 or so years ago. It was far more to the point - and, therefore, more interesting.",1211068800,13,1458,4.735177865612648
3155979,4,B00169E5JQ,"I watched all 10 hours and it never lost my interest.  Depicted the aduous life of 5500 sailors aboard a warship on overseas deployment.
The ten episodes profile many of the officers and Enlisted, both men and women, from lowest ranking to highest crewmember.  The mixture of fighter pilots to Aviation Boatswain's Mates to Mess Management Specialists to Petty Officers to the Chiefs, is all here.

The only thing missing, quite naturally, was much if anything about the below desks Nuclear Reactors and those highly secretive, wonderous ship's propulsion operations.  Suffice to say, a nuclear carrier, at 90,000+ tons displacement, can operate underway without refueling for decades.

Surprisingly, the U.S. Navy has found a way for the crew, both men and women, straights and gays, to perform some of the most dangerous jobs imaginable.  They work side by side, 24/7, while air ops are underway, but still keep their ""off duty"" personal lives separate; a feat easier said than done under such congested living conditions.  The aircraft carrier and airwings' daily routine are in complete harmony and about efficient as any large organization possibly can be.

I believe this is the best documentary depicting in great detail, what it is really like to be in the Navy, in the history of documentary films.  I should know, I served four years aboard CVN ship during three overseas deployments during the Vietnam War era.  The ""airdale"" (or bird farm) Navy is still a LOT like I remember it from 35+ years ago, except of course, sadly, there were absolutely no women allowed aboard combat ships way back then.

BRAVO PBS for bringing such an interesting, high quality production, both in content as a tribute to America's men and women serving in the Armed Forces, and in format as a the ""HD"" televison production.  ""CARRIER"" was a pleasure to watch from beginning to end.",1210809600,18,1872,4.983922829581994
3155980,5,B00169E5JQ,"I'm a sucker for documentaries. Even though PBS comes in with lots of ghosting and static, I watched the first five episodes, then bought the DVD to watch the rest. My father was a carrier pilot, but beyond that personal connection, it is interesting to see the different military mindsets up and down the ranks. To some extent, our American class structure replicates itself on board the Nimitz. Non-commissioned support grades are highly integrated while command is still largely, though not entirely, white and male. Command staff are generally gung-ho patriotic; Lower ranks are often just as intense but some express, ""It's just a job"" or, ""We're here for the oil"" opinions, too. If Carrier is any indication, the Navy offers full employment, hard work, intense supervision and the sort of camaraderie you don't always find on dry land. That so many of these folk admitted they needed all that is a sad commentary on parenting, schooling and society.

The documentary is definitely character-driven, with some personal revelations drawing gasps from my wife, who identified all too well with the working class element on board. One episode featured a good ol' OK boy that tragically couldn't (or wouldn't) get past his racist upbringing. Another sad moment was the fallout from an inebriated sexual encounter, while on liberty, between two shipmates that barely even knew each other.

Update: I think I can see why some have complained about the personal stories. Whereas the first five or six hours struck a good balance between the requirements of the mission and the personal stories of the crew, the last three or four hours focused almost entirely on personal situations. To some extent this is understandable since the primary mission was completed, but as much as I connected with their stories, all that personal griping did become a bit tedious.",1210636800,8,1859,5.071895424836601

The focus on the private lives of many of the featured crew members was uninteresting and unnecessary.  We don't need an aircraft carrier as the backdrop in order to tell petty stories of personal relationships.  On top of that, the filmmakers focused on what appear to be among the least inspired and satisfied crew members.  To watch this series, I would be left thinking that pretty much everyone in the Navy hates their job and has issues with the command system that has existed in militaries since the beginning of time.  It was not as good as I hoped.",1210464000,4,666,4.756521739130434

So when I found out this show was airing, I marked my calendar so as not to miss a single episode.  I was not disappointed.  I remember my father describing life aboard aircraft carriers as being like ""a city at sea,"" but I never fully understood what he meant by that until seeing this series.  Of course one of the most exciting, suspense-filled episodes is the one where they show the aircraft taking off and landing.  But the real story that's uncovered is just how much manpower it takes to make that happen.
I was literally moved tears to see the sacrifices these young recruits make, and my heart goes out to them.  All episodes are good but my least favorite of them is episode 8, ""True Believers"" which explores the many faiths on board the Nimitz.  In place of this episode, I would've preferred to see a visit to the ship's hospital or clinic, with interviews with the ship's doctor, dentist, and nurse, to see how the medical personnel fit into the overall scheme of things.  Overall, this series gives an unbiased glimpse into the interworkings of an aircraft carrier that highlights the human element.

We who have seen the show have every reason to review it here. Since this hasn't been released yet, one important reason to do a review here and now is to help encourage Amazon and PBS and whoever to put this series out on the market. Why should they publish it if there's no buzz, no viewer support?
I'm writing this to help get it out there so HDCollector actually has the option of collecting it. Duh.

But also, of course the DVD itself and the extras are worth knowing about, and when/if this comes out I'll report on those aspects. But whether it's a superb DVD set or just average in terms of the extras and the quality of DVD reproduction, at least 90% of the overall value of the set is the content--is what I just watched on my big screen.

And that was amazingly good, as most of the other reviewers have noted--it didn't impose a Navy PR scam or an antiwar screed on the story. You get the an honest, nuanced view of life on an American carrier.

It even got me a little weepy at the end, watching the air controller's reunion with her two kids after moving heaven and earth to get them there.

A truly worthy show, and one other documentarians should watch to see how you can do a great job with the sort of thing that usually just gets a propaganda treatment, either pro or con. The praise from the Navy guys who wrote reviews says it all.

The show captures the real ambivalence some have regarding our strategy on ""the war on terror"" and yet how they continue to serve professionally in fulfilling their duties.  What I most took away from the series was the exceptional sacrifices these military members make by serving long (monotonous) tours away from their families and from the remedial comforts of home that most of us take for granted.  ""Carrier"" puts a human face to the Navy and its personnel whose service is often performed out of sight of the American public.

It was in dry dock in Norfolk.  It had just come back from a Westpac to Vietnam.  In thirty plus years, nothing has changed, with exception of women on board warships now days.  At sea, it was a 24/7 operation.  On a Med cruise, once the carrier left the pier in Norfolk, you never tied up at a pier again until you returned to the states.  Always anchored out, and the always enjoyable boat ride to the dock.  The constant cleaning, the enjoyable 3 months spent `mess cooking', and like they pointed out in the show, the ship was like a huge high school.  You had it all, from the jocks to the geeks and everything in between.  My personal favorite was the every three day refueling/resupply evolutions.  Just like clockwork, and for some strange reason, we did it around midnight every time. Top Gun was Hollywood, this is the real deal.",1209427200,21,1000,4.404371584699454

3389745,4,B00169E5JQ,"Owing to a childhood fascination, I've watched pretty much every documentary on carriers produced in the last ten years. A few of them have been Nat Geo productions, and the latest rounds play all the time on the Discovery Channel and the Military Channel. This series beats them all, hands down.

The problem with most documentaries on this subject--or virtually any 'mainstream' docu on military topics, is that the filmmakers get distracted by the whistles, bells, and blinking lights of all the technology. As a result, the documentary lens becomes clouded by all the 'gee-whiz' of the technology and machines. Granted, this sort of perspective has its place. What gets lost, or uncovered, however, is something far more compelling, and that's the human element. A carrier is, as the old saying goes, a city at sea, and it's the lives of the crew that make for real storytelling, not more of the same file footage of missile launches or facts about the latest blocks of the CIWS and the takeoff thrust of an F/A-18 at full military power.

This series focuses on the stories of the crew, and many of them are quite moving. It's hard not to get a lump in the throat when watching how hard these (predominantly) 18- and 19- year olds have to work in order to send aircraft over the bow, or how they're trying to meet the demands of family life from thousands of miles away at sea. Their personal struggles and hopes are the meat of this series.

Production values on this series are quite high. I met the producers at a sneak preview and found that they had shot over 3,000 hours of HD video over the course of a six-month deployment. Working over that time, and with a 17-member production and shooting team, they found the real stories in the nooks and crannies of the ship. The editing, which was done by a team, is also quite good, as is the music design. The net result is a series that has the look and feel of a modern reality series, without any of the sensationalism. In short, it's filmmaking by adults. The assistance of the Navy was also nothing short of remarkable--here on the series some of the characters speak openly about how hard their jobs are, or how they work with gay crewmembers, or how they don't understand the war they're supporting. This internal confliction and confusion, from the words of servicemen and women, makes for real storytelling and makes this  series worth recommending above any other on the same topic.",1209340800,125,2448,4.672853828306264

3389759,2,B00169E5JQ,"This program does a great job in showing what life is like on an aircraft carrier. That's about where the good part ends and they probably could've gotten through that in 2 episodes. From the beginning (even the title music), they continually try to ram down your throat their own editorial opinion that the US shouldn't have been in the Gulf. They try to do it by interviewing the crew, letting the ones who agree with their viewpoint drone on mercilessly, and cutting short anyone who has an articulate point to the contrary. Unlike most PBS shows I remember from 20 or 30 years ago, there is very little factual or technical content in this show. The producers instead seem to prefer attempting (poorly, at that) to make a political point. The video quality is good (not excellent) and they stuck it out, seemingly taking footage from the entirety of a 6-month tour on the carrier. I would've been happier if they'd stuck to what they're good at, because they're not good changing the minds of viewers in the political arena.",1480291200,,1028,4.685082872928176

I expected this to be the standard spin that I have seen in other docs of this type but it was not. What hooked me was the people, their candor, and their willingness to be vulnerable to the rest of the world. This is not a story about the Navy, nor is it a story about life in the service; it is a story about LIFE--the fun, the disappointments, the sacrifices, and the fact that it happens to all of us. They make so many movies these days that tug at our heart strings, but the stories aren't real; it's fiction. Made up. But Carrier is about REAL stories, about REAL people, with REAL stories to tell. Whether you agree or disagree with the way politicians run this country, you still have to admire the heart that people who serve our country have to do their jobs, even when they don't agree with their superiors. We can all learn from the folks portrayed in this film.",1476576000,,1053,4.3232323232323235

LOL!  Interviews with more experienced crew members were not quite as boring.  This had good intentions but it many of these kids really would benefit and grow up.  Would I recommend this documentary, most likely not, unless you find entertainment is kids complaining about a structured life style on an air craft carrier.

3389856,1,B00169E5JQ,"Why is PBS doing a documentary on the military? Is it because they loath it? Or is it to influence young people into not joining?
When was the last time PBS shed such a dark light on the Peace Corp or Green Peace as they did the Navy on this documentary?
It is sad and not unexpected that they emphatically showed more the negative than the positive on this documentary.

We had it good compared to the hard hours at sea-our flight quarters started at 4am and ended at 2300 hours, and when we were in the MED, every third night starting at 2230 until 0530 we were along side an AO taking on NSFO and Jp5, avgas..that was on top of a regular work day, watches not with standing.

It had some similarities to a Tiger Cruise experience I had aboard the USS Tarawa, a smaller ship with a flight deck carrying Harrier jets and helicopters aboard.  Another interesting factor was knowing one of the Marine pilots on board the Nimitz.

I decided to look it up later that night and then proceed to watch the whole series in the following 24 hours. I loved that it gave you a raw and real look into the people on the ship, as opposed to the ships lay out or weapons. Much of what the people have to say was through provoking and made you almost reexamine some of your oven beliefs. The only thing that disrupted the flow of this awesome series was the amount of repeat footage.. I will say that it was probably more noticeable to me than it would be for some one who watched the show spread across a longer period of time.

This is not a reflection on the film, but it did affect my attitude towards continuing to watch it.  Several times I just had to shut it off and wait for my attitude to clear.  I gave it 3 stars simply because this is a good film for non-military folks to watch to get a good idea of what our military endures for our freedoms.",1456531200,,690,3.9782608695652173

It was like different people put together and made the last half of the season. People started to introduce themselves that we already met, it was like the director did not trust the audience to remember anyone, it was sort of insulting.  They seemed to pick just a few interesting people and tried to make a story out of it... it fell flat.

Having spent my civilian career working in the computer field it was interesting to see the use of computers throughout the ship.

From this series I learned
1. Choose a job that will let you work in the ac on the carrier.
2. Expect a lot of pressure on keeping a happy personal relationship with a boyfriend or girlfriend.
3. You will be taken advantage of.
What I mean is that on the third episode that discusses relationships...heterosexual relationships are punished and Homosexual relationships are encouraged.  It was interesting that the girl airmen had to write word essays for their punishment for having a intimate relationship with a male ship mate but the men ship mate would be punished with lower pay.  Its almost as if upper management or senior officers were using the women to go around and lower the mens pay as punishment.  If the senior officers wanted to put a stop to such heterosexual relationships then they would severely punish the women and not make them write word essays.  The ship has a ratio of one woman to seven men.  More women cant be placed on the ship?  The homosexual relationships were treated by senior officers as a don't ask and don't tell policy.  The rational for discouraging heterosexual relationships is that if they go sour then it can cause drama in the work environment.  This rationale totally ignores the higher chance of relationship violence that take place in homosexual relationships.  Law enforcement has known this for years of a higher rate of violence in homosexual relationships.  In fact one of Jeffery Dahmers victims escaped and found a police officer and told the police officer he was trying to kill him but as soon as Dahmer explained that they were gay and that they were having a lovers fight the officer dismissed the victims claims.  I was also surprised by witch craft being allowed on board from eppisode 8",1442707200,,1850,4.786163522012578

3390218,5,B00169E5JQ,I absolutely LOVED this series. I have looked at it completely maybe three times. Its the only series to provide real day to day details on all levels of life on an aircraft carrier. I felt like I knew some of the people when it was all done. I also learned a lot about some of the jobs onboard.,1426636800,,295,4.016949152542373

3390221,5,B00169E5JQ,"This 10-part series follows the nuke powered aircraft carrier, Nimitz, through a six-month cruise to the Persian Gulf during the Iraq war. While it covers things generally, it keys in on about a dozen personnel, from pilots in the flight squadron to lowly deck apes, and follows their trials and tribulations during the lengthy time at sea. It's interesting to note that the operations included 1,167 combat sorties over Iraq and yet the squadron dropped not one piece of ordnance; a hell of a waste of fuel. Another thing that became clear to an old former swab is that, while the modern Navy is different in many ways (email, telephones, televisions, game consoles?) there's still a lot of griping and bitching and ""I don't wanna be here"" from the lower echelons of the food chain. Most former servicemen know someone who got ""Dear Johned"" and we get to see a young aviation E-3 who has a pregnant girlfriend back in San Diego whose emails dwindle down to nothing over a period of time; it's amazing that the viewer can figure out so effortlessly what's going on, but the little sob-sister victim of this situation can't seem to wrap his head around the idea that any woman wouldn't swoon at the sight of him. Back in port and home, he gets the straight scoop from the gal. And of course, he weeps some more. This is well worth the look if you ever wondered what goes on on these floating cities of 5,500 souls.",1426291200,3,1413,4.58893280632411
3390222,5,B00169E5JQ,"This is a great view into the workings and the people who served in the Navy during the first Gulf War. They do not all agree on why they are doing what they are doing, how they are doing it but they do their jobs under amazing pressure. Some of these sailors (and airmen/women) are still teenagers and all are very young. What they do is beyond amazing!

Living on a ship is hard during normal times, being that far from home gives a whole new set of issues to our service members. This video is wonderfully shot and directed. A must watch for any young person considering serving on a Navy carrier ship.",1426032000,,605,4.307017543859649

Then I realized, that's what it's like on a carrier; the highs, the lows and the long days in between. It felt that this show was faithful to it's subject without over glamorizing or deprecating it. From the highest ranks to the lowest E1 airman, a good view into the life of the people who put their lives on the line for their fellow citizens aboard the USS Nimitz. Soundtrack is not bad either.",1422230400,,497,4.413043478260869

3390237,2,B00169E5JQ,"The Navy gave the producers of this series remarkable access to the USS Nimitz and the results are often terrific. Ship and jet fanciers will love the creative video especially, but the chronicles of life aboard ship are uneven. It is definitely not a recruiter's dream show as a number of those interviewed decry their decisions to join up while others complain about the way the higher-ups treat them.
Carrier gets two out of five stars from me for a couple of reasons. I think the show runners could have accomplished more with fewer episodes . . . though the network probably ordered ten to fill out the season. As a result, the latter episodes seem padded and spend far too much time with a couple of individuals whose stories just aren't that compelling. A young airman with a pregnant girlfriend back home worries endlessly why she sounds so strange on the phone and isn't emailing him as much as he'd like. After listening to him whine through five or so episodes, I was surprised his shipmates hadn't cast him adrift. Another crew member brags through two episodes that he's a racist and wants the Navy to discharge him. His smarmy attitude and clueless laughter kept me fast forwarding.
Five stars for the stunning video, three for overall content, three for the cinema-veritae style which gets tiresome after awhile, and two for a soundtrack that sounds like it was written by a Top Gun music creator-wannabe and just never stays far enough in the background.
Bottom line...life aboard an aircraft carrier gets monotonous. Sadly, so does the video series Carrier.",1420329600,,1574,4.833333333333333

Unlike the many shows that show 45 minutes of aircraft and pilots in 45 minutes, this series focuses on the young men and women who do the critical and unappreciated jobs most never discuss.  Almost every aspect of life aboard a US Navy carrier is shown.  No narration, every word comes from those who serve and the people who know and love them.",1419033600,,592,4.556603773584905

It is quite lengthy and you have a good look at life on board the Carrier and how every one interacts. I thought it was sad that one young man was discharged due to he being racist toward an Negro American. It is sad that even to this day there are people who are racist in American because his Parents were. Does he not know he has a choice and need not carry this prejudice forward to another generation. When you consider how awful the Negroes were treated in history. Stolen from their home land to be slaves to the Southern States and their plantations.

I have always been fascinated by carriers and naval aviation, but this series showed that there is so much more on a personal level than just shooting and recovering aircraft. The personal toll of being away was something I imagined when thinking about a carrier cruise before, but this series really brought it home. Really heartbreaking at times. The other thing that impressed me was the character of our service people who are just like us but who are trying to build a better life for themselves. This series made me feel like I was on the cruise as part of the crew. Whether you enjoy military stories or not, you should watch this.

I've watched many videos streamed from Amazon on my Kindle Fire. A quality set of small Bose earphones helps when viewing in the early AM hours to not disturb others who are still sleeping. Very informative and educational.......I highly recommend this series.",1407542400,,646,5.046728971962617

It seems to be an honest portrayal of the repetitiveness of their days, their loneliness for their families, and the hardships they endure in their lives.  It interviews people from the Captain down to the people who work in the garbage area.  How fortunate we are to have them defending us.  Thank you to all active duty military and veterans!

3390308,5,B00169E5JQ,"Life aboard any Navy ship is structured and regimented but that is upped on a Super Carrier.  This show takes you inside the belly of the beast, into all those hidden nooks and crannies where the majority of the 5000 man and woman crew live and work.  Of special interest is the level of access granted the film crew for the entire deployment and the candor of individual crew members  on any and all subject not classified; sex, racism, drudgery, cramped living space and perceived unreasonable demands.  But also shown is the bond those working in each area have for each other, the mentoring and acts of understanding and support given.  Time is also spent on the mission of the carrier and the cost on family life back home.  The average age of those serving is between 18-20 so the majority of the crew treat their circumstance as an extension of high school and some view it as a form of prison.  Not lost in translation is that democracy can't be practiced on a warship and the mission is projection of force and sometimes combat; life aboard a super carrier is not a game; it is deadly serious.",1403308800,,1102,4.5353535353535355

3390320,5,B00169E5JQ,"This documentary took place around 2004. My ship the Stennis relived the Nimitz.
I worked in the engineering department (catapults), our department provided the steam pressure (accumulator) for the green shirts (catapults aviation) and yes they work about 15 hours a day if they are lucky. They work all of flight ops, and in down time, they have to grease the cables. I felt sorry for them. Never join the Navy as an un-designated airmen because that is where they probably would place you if you are assign on a ship.
Aviation ordnance have it a little better. Large staff which provides a little bit more down time.
I worked 2 years in the catapults department of an aircraft carrier and 2 years as an aviation mechanic. While deployed, aviation mechanic work about 13 hour shifts that is if there is no training. Aviation ordnance have it about the same.

3390356,3,B00169E5JQ,"I really don't know how to rate something like this so I averaged out and gave it three stars. The general consensus seems to be that this is realistic. My comment is that the United States Navy, or somebody in decision making power there had to be dead crazy to allow this to be made in the first place. If you are considering a career in the Navy you better steer clear because in the two episodes I have seen on public TV there is scarcely a single positive moment. As a dramatic critique there is no focus whatsoever. Seemingly random footage and events stitched together by someone with no concept of film making. Exposition, denouement, resolution and other components of stage and screen are no more than words in a dictionary to whomever created this excuse for a documentary. Camera work and editing are equally suspect. Maybe the worst military series I have ever seen, the more I think about it the less I like it and I am going back to ""Victory At Sea"" or ""World At War"".",1379203200,,983,4.466666666666667

3390361,5,B00169E5JQ,"This is a great series (more of a documentary) for those wanting to get a feel for military service, in particular life on a Navy carrier. The director does a nice job portraying various situations and often presents multiple perspectives from across the ranks. Surprise - not every member of the crew is a happy camper. A few four letter words creep into the dialog but most scenes are family friendly. A well chosen sound track enriches the material and reinforces the day to day (mundane) rituals that define a typical tour of duty. Those seeking dog fights and intense combat scenes should look elsewhere. Over time you begin to connect with several service men/women and realize what a huge personal sacrifice they make to keep the rest of us safe.",1378252800,,753,4.755725190839694

As an ex-serviceman I expect military people to behave professionally and in accord with the importance of their jobs.  I don't care about punks' laundry and personal relationships and how they miss mommy and daddy.  That ship and those planes cost millions of dollars and is supposedly critical to the nation's defense.

It humbled me to see so many men and women--many just barely old enough to vote--working together, serving our nation.  I was expecting a lengthy recruitment video, but was surprised to see that it also included those who were less than enchanted with the reality of serving in the military.

The series is a rare look into the culture aboard an aircraft carrrier -- a sort of microcosm where people are forced to interact and make things happen whether they like it or not, whether they like each other or not. I loved the approach to the whole series, the questions they raise, stories of the people aboard which allowed us to look beyond the military veneer. But, it needs to be remembered, this deployment did happen for a reason and sometimes the story seemed to divert the viewers' attention to personal aspects of the crew rather than the big political picture. What I was most impressed with was with the narrative skill of how the various stories were put together in different episodes, and how it was visually mastered with the stunning editing craftsmanship.

3390394,5,B00169E5JQ,"This documentary is one of the best I have seen. It is simply high quality thought provoking television. As others have said it is in no way an ad for the Navy in fact I was surprised at just how critical many of the sailors were with regards to the Navy. At one point, they show a sailor lugging around some ridiculous industrial incarnation of pre-made food and she talks about how the recruiter told her the Navy has an excellent culinary program. Reminds of when my art student college roommate told me the recruiter said they have people that paint tanks! The series is a very interesting  insight into the people on the ship not the ship. There are a few lines about the engine's horsepower but generally this is about people, my wife was surprised at how watchable it was for her. Obviously there are political implications but the series itself is not political. For me, one of the most interesting aspects of the series was the degree to which work is segregated and the degree to which the soldiers are detached from the potential killing. This person maintains the bombs, this person transports them to the plane, this person arms them, the pilot doesn't even really decide to drop them or not. Finally, I noticed some reviews talking about the frat boy antics of the pilots. I was equally turned off by those parts but think they are none-the-less an important part of the series. I don't think the series did anything to infer that their behavior was good or bad they just showed it. For me, it was disappointing to see that the pilots in charge of the air wing were both of the mindset that: everything is black and white (direct quote). I wondered several times whether these zealous pilots still speak so adoringly about doing the President's bidding since the 2008 election. Whereas the pilots who were no less dutiful soldiers but had a more nuanced view on killing people were somewhat ostracized. The commander of the air wing explains why another pilot is not really part of the group by referring to him with a telling chuckle as a ""blue guy."" I'm just sharing these little tidbits about the series to indicate some of the internal moral conversations this series evokes. If you watch this with an open mind you will reinforce some of your preconceived notions but change some too.",1363219200,,2303,4.644607843137255
3390395,5,B00169E5JQ,"Many years ago, I recall catching a few episodes of this series, because I remembered certain parts as I went through the entire series this time.

3390396,4,B00169E5JQ,Having spent 10 years in the military (and I did like the experience) this is the first series I have seen that really shows the day to day life of a sailor. I gave it 4 stars because it is a bit slow moving.,1362787200,,208,3.75
3390397,5,B00169E5JQ,"I (husband of the owner of this Amazon account) spent four years in the Navy, much of that time aboard two ships. While my ships were much smaller than the Nimitz this program still brought me back to those Navy days. I think the production crew did a great job of showing life aboard the carrier. I was so pleased with the series that I actually watched it a second time after a two year break from the first watching.

I wish a different view could have been exposed of life aboard the ship though. This series seemed to heavily focus on the lower level of jobs aboard the ship. Mentions were made of the middle level jobs such as radar operators, communications technicians, and other jobs, but the series painted too bleak a picture of ship life.

My experience was much better as I was an Electronics Technician on a ship with a crew of about 250 men. I only mention this so others who watch this series doesn't get a tainted picture of the Navy. My personal experience led to a lifelong career that I fully credit to my Navy schooling. It also left me with a love for the sea and many happy years sailing, SCUBA diving, and jet skiing on the ocean.

The many shots of carrier take-offs and landings were great too. I highly recommend this series. For those who have had no military exposure this is also a great way to see the way our tax dollars are used to protect our country. It takes a massive effort to put the Navy into action in our defense.",1361923200,,1455,4.322344322344322

3390401,5,B00169E5JQ,I've thoroughly enjoyed the look inside the Navy that this series provides. It takes you below the deck of the USS Nimitz for a look at day-to-day operations while on a 6-month deployment. Getting to know the people gives you much greater respect for any man or woman in uniform and the struggles they go through at sea and back home. Enjoyed every minute of this.,1354924800,,364,4.53030303030303
3390402,5,B00169E5JQ,"My husband brought this DVD home from the library; not our usual fare but it was an Emmy award winner and he had an idle interest in how aircraft carriers work, technically.  I didn't expect to watch it at all, suspected it of being war propaganda. We belong to the 50% of the population who would like to see the GWOT finish and the troops come home.  But then the quality of the soundtrack and the production enticed me to perch for a few minutes.  One thing led to another, which I do not regret in the least.

At first we intended to watch only a couple of episodes.  Then we got hooked.  We realized we would be watching the entire thing, so we might as well settle in comfortably for the duration.  We watched 2 episodes per evening, every evening, which is about the right balance.  Any more than that and you would be complaining like some of these user reviewers do about ""tedious"", any less frequently you would lose the various story lines.  And there are issues raised in each episode that you want to give yourself the opportunity to think over and discuss.

The soundtrack was very, very good, and it is all original music composed specifically for the documentary.  I thought of buying it as a music CD but it turns out there is none available.

The high points of the documentary were the shots of the planes taking off and landing on the flight deck, the pilots attended by the choreographed body signals of the ground crew airmen.  Those must have been the shots which won the Emmy for cinematography.  Those scenes were unforgettable.

Then in episode 8 came the dramatic climax of the film, something which was more exciting than any fictional ""action adventure"" scene in any Hollywood blockbuster; this was real and it happened in real time over several hours, day giving way to night  --  the storm at sea, in the open ocean 700 miles from land, and the planes in the air unable to land on the pitching flight deck of the carrier.  Landing elsewhere was not an option  --  they didn't carry enough fuel to make an emergency landing on a conventional airstrip.  The hours passed, plane after plane coming in for a landing and unable to land, forced off the carrier.  Night falling making the whole thing even worse, reduced visibility adding to the problems on the pitching flight deck. They sent out a small tanker airplane, finally, expecting that the fruitlessly circling fighter jets would run out of fuel before they could successfully land.  At this point the intrepid squadron commander, a grizzled veteran ready for retirement, pulled rank and took the tanker plane out himself, bumping the less experienced aviator who had been assigned.

It had me sitting on the edge of my seat, that episode.  Incredibly well filmed, and the soundtrack was brilliant during this dramatic interlude.  Two days later it came to me that perhaps, just perhaps, the captain had shown poor judgement in ordering the planes aloft in such conditions  --  if so, there was no reprimand shown in the film.  His explanation that the training of the aviators needed to be kept up was accepted without question.  Yet there was an enormous stink raised over an aviator who was unable to connect with a mid-air tanker refueling during a training exercise in the Gulf and had to make an emergency landing (successful) at the Baghdad International Airport.  And an even bigger stink over a sexual encounter (consensual)between two carrier staff (male and female) while they were on shore leave.  Sometimes military culture is quite perplexing, as the film demonstrated.

I did come away with an enhanced appreciation for the military as an important social institution of American culture.  It is a family for those without one, it is a sanctuary for those fleeing from inner city gang violence, it offers status to those who would otherwise have none.  It stands in lieu of college, for those who are not going to college; it is a broadening and educational and positive experience for young people just out of high school. It acts as a finishing school for people who are not quite grown up.  It grows them up, usually safely, unless there is a war going on.  If only it didn't go to war so often I would like the military a lot more, but I guess there is the downside to everything...  The young enlisted men and women were very endearing over the course of the film.  We wonder what happened to them, and we wish them well.",1343692800,,4426,4.661935483870968
3390403,5,B00169E5JQ,"Not having been a member of the Navy, I can not say anything about the authenticity of the series.
But I was always fascinated with these big ships, and how life could be on board them. And the series delivers in that regard, introducing not only the unique life of the fighter pilots, but also of enlisted crew members. It may be exaggerated, or not, but so is most things on TV, yet I think it gives decent inside look, hard to find anywhere else.",1334275200,,449,4.294117647058823

3390409,4,B00169E5JQ,"There are approx. 10 hours looking at military life on an aircraft carrier around 2006, when Bush had us over in the Persian Gulf....does it ever end? Anyways, the first disc says most of it and ends on a high note of pride and goosebumps. I can see why some ex-military don't like the series which includes some service personnel less than perfect in attitude and maturity but that's some of the younger generation isn't it? I'm a college teacher and see it too.
At the same time, probably too much time spent on individuals and redundancy concerning pilots flying off and on the ship. Balanced commentary on how individuals see their mission....some express doubt that a carrier is even needed in our kind of war today; others just say they trust the higher ups to make decisions and it's their duty to carry it out without skepticism.  The downtime at various ports are interesting. I liked one of the final discs dealing with a session on adjusting back to civilian life.

3390410,4,B00169E5JQ,"It isn't a documentary intended to inform. It isn't a mini-series with a story to tell. This program is simply reality TV of life on a carrier. At times the experience on the carrier is exciting, at times tedious and boring, at times controversial.  The range of personalities is vast.  It's basically a video scrapbook of life on a carrier and the people on it. There is no form or structure of traditional storytelling. This production is really a collage of experiences. If one understands and can accept this, one can probably understand why this series may feel slightly loose and aimless. But such is the nature of a photo album (in this instance, a video album). You are simply looking at different pages (episodes) and enjoying each one for what it is. Can be enjoyable for folks who appreciate the military life. And can be an uncompromisingly blunt view for folks who have no concept of or experience with it. Would not call it an infomercial, or even a recruiting commercial, since there is no RAH RAH SIS BOOM BAH ""marching band"" style patriotism.

3390413,4,B00169E5JQ,"This documentry is a bit like a Reality Show.  Still, it is effective in providing a portrait of what motivates US Navy Personnel today.  Perhaps overly long at 10 episodes, the length of the series does give some ideal of the monotonous nature of modern naval service.  The Carrier USS Nimitz seems to provide a modern US Gunboat diplomacy for our gov.  Why this is necessary is never quite explained, although some of the crew do question what the purpose of their mission is.  The Carrier seems to bounce around various potential trouble spots, while pulling in for various ports of call to amuse the crew and provide some needed diversion.  All of this would seem to be very expensive for today's US tax payer!

At length the ship arrives off the Persian Gulf to provide back-up for on-going sundry operations against Insurgents in Iraq.  Again, it seems excessive to have such a powerful vessle supporting various small unit actions on the ground.  In fact the Nimitz F-16s are never called upon once to provide direct ground support and spend most of their time hovering overhead.  Again, a huge waste of money.  In fact ths mis-placed use of the Nimitz serves as a mirror for virtually the whole Iraqi operation.  Presumptiously called Op Iraqi Freedom.  The Freedom remains an open question to this day.  Still, the majority of the crew seem to feel they are doing right in their mission and one can't help admiring their trust in the system.

In looking at this series one can see that the navy is different things for different people.  On the upper level are the officers and highly trained navy pilots who seem to get the most out of the service.  On the lower level are the younger members of the crew providing various grunt work to support the whole effort.  For many of these kids the navy is a stop-gap for what could be a far worse life on the streets of urban America.  The service provides a degree of stability and discipline that many American youth lack and desperately need.

While a bit preechy at times, and venturing a bit into Realty TV realms, this series is none the less a fascianting look at today's US navy and the crew who make it work.  The 5,000 souls on the USS Nimitz each have a story to tell.",1299110400,,2232,4.571788413098237

A lot of the stuff that was portrayed in this film is real to the core how it is on a naval vessel.  I've never done a tour on a carrier before but this was def worth the watch.  As a lot of people say about the cussing all through the film, I'm pretty sure it says VIEWER DISCRETION ADVISED for language plus the language hasn't changed since WWII much either (grand dad was a sailor in WWII, I've heard the stories) so ""old timers"" have no place to criticize.

This series is absolutely fascinating. The Navy is my ""favorite"" branch of the service - my Dad served on the USS Midway, and I was baptized on the ship. You could say I have a from-the-cradle loyalty to the Navy ;-)

It's so intriguing to watch the inner workings of a deployment & life on an aircraft carrier. We are privy to the personal stories of select crew members, the ups and downs of life both at home and at sea for each of them. I got really involved in what was going on for some of these folks. I saw that someone mentioned they'd like a follow-up on the sailors - I would too. Just 10 episodes, but they get in-depth and it just draws you in.

I think this is a magnificent documentary/""reality"" series. I spent 600 minutes over the course of a week watching each episode, and don't regret a minute of the time spent.

The young people especially are so impressive. Those of us who are used to seeing 18 year-olds hanging out at the mall and texting and gossiping will appreciate what those kids could be if given the opportunity. The level of responsibility these people have is amazing. I can't say enough about this film. People who are not familiar with the military would do well to watch it, because it does an excellent job of showing what the military culture is all about. It's really inspiring, and not just in a rah-rah-rah patriotic way, but more in just a human way. It would be great if at some point the same production crew would do a similar film on the Army or Marine Corps. It would be great for the American people to see what their military is doing and to see the extraordinary work these people do. Two thumbs up.",1251936000,,1135,4.596059113300493

I've always been interested in the Navy.  I come from a Navy town and several members of my family were either in the Navy or were civilians working building ships in the Navy Yard.  I didn't really know what went on board an aircraft carrier until I saw this program.  I found the stories of the regular crewman pretty interesting.  They work 16-18 hours a day, then try to sleep in a tiny bunk separated from the corridor with a little curtain, all while planes are landing overhead every couple of minutes.  And if you work on the flight deck in the Middle East, it's 130 degrees while you're wearing a long-sleeve turtleneck and a nylon vest. I didn't find the stories of the pilots to be as interesting and think too much time was spent on their frat-house antics.

I think the Navy is to be commended for the frankness of this program.  Even something shocking like the sexual assault prevention officer being suspected of rape wasn't whitewashed at all.  Those interviewed gave their opinion, good and bad, of their mission.  Even on the topic of 'don't ask, don't tell', I was surprised how near some sailors came to admitting being gay.  And for those who complained about the swearing: they are SAILORS.  Have you ever heard the expression 'swear like a sailor'?

On the downside, there was too much time spent on one particular sailor whose pregnant girlfriend was obviously giving him the brushoff for the entire 10 episodes.  I felt bad for the guy, but by the 3rd episode, I was yelling at the TV for him to get a clue.  The other thing that got a little tiresome were the little 'music videos' interspersed.  Most of the music was good, but they just went on too long and there were too many of them.",1238112000,4,1890,4.495601173020527

They told many interesting back stories about people's lives before joining the Navy.  Although lots of people on the show complained about their navy job (as many civilians also do), it seemed like the navy pulled many of these folks from messed up family and life situations and provided needed structure.

The carrier technology and the planes technology is fascinating - but the constant usage of very graphic language throughout - ruined it.  I could only make it through the first couple of segments before returning it - which I promptly did.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  It's not a cuss word here and there - it's constant vulgarity and disrespect to authority.  Maybe I am old fashioned but if you don't like being on a ship and can do nothing but swear about your superior officers when they're not around - don't join the Navy.  The sub-title of this DVD is 1 ship 5,000 stories.  More realistically it should be 1 ship 5,000 cuss words.",1213920000,10,824,4.476510067114094

If you want a bunch of pompus officers sitting there spitting out the same talking points you can hear again and again then this isn't the documentary for you.  However, if you want an honest uncensored look at what is like on a deployment then this is what you want to watch.
You see the good and the bad.  The Sailors drawing strength from each other as days turn into weeks and then months.  You see how crap really does roll down hill as far as things not being the way they should be.

Well here is a honest look at those who are young, those who are in the middle and those who are older.
Many of those younger folks in the military do as little as possible and get mad when they are told to do something right.

  After watching these ten hours, I consider every member of the Nimitz crew one of my blessings as an American.

  At first I was disappointed. I was expecting and hoping for a detailed viewing of the ship itself, its airplanes and all the gizmos that make the marvel of technology work. Instead the ten hours focused on the people, the crew from the guy who mopped the floors to the men and women flying aircraft into combat zones, the deck crew, the cooks, the hundreds of occupations it takes to make this colossus function.

  Above all, I am surprised that this was on PBS: it wasn't anti-war, anti-American, didn't celebrate left-wing dictators. It was a paean to the United States of America in it is wonderful.

  Little time (unfortunately in a way) is spent on the ship and its operations. Most of the time is spent in interviews and voiceovers with the crew. It is stunning that so many of the crew are so young. Teenagers or barely out of their teens. Many tell the stories of their short lives, stories they freely admit could have turned out horribly. Kids moving down the wrong paths in life - and entering the Navy helped them straighten out their lives.

  There are personal stories of how some of these people go off on a months long deployment, leaving families and loved ones behind with sometimes hurtful circumstances. How do you react when your wife miscarries while you are thousands of miles away in the Arabian Gulf? Your pregnant girlfriend doesn't communicate with you. Your divorced spouse is fighting with you over the custody of the kids and won't send you photographs of your youngest child's first day at school.

  And yet these people serve. They do their jobs for their nation and for their families: their real families and their Navy family.

  There are so many stories in ""Carrier"", not a one of which ultimately comes up empty or trite. The directors and editors have done their job extremely well. The story that ultimately comes across is not of the ship itself, but of these heroes - yes, they are heroes - who serve their country.

  As the Admiral says ""Count your blessings as Americans"". The more than 5,000 crew members profiled in ""Carrier"" are indeed blessings to the United States of America. This is a wonderful production.

3390453,5,B00169E5JQ,"This was a VERY comprehensive documentary that accurately depicted everyday life aboard a U.S. Navy nuclear aircraft carrier, the USS Nimitz, CVN-68.  It was gratifying to me personally because I served four years on active duty aboard another nuclear carrier, the USS Enterprise back in the 70s.

Unfortunately, I could not relate as much to this documentary because it did not delve into the Nuclear Propulsion areas of the work done by those crewmembers aboard such ships.  I guess the Navy has not yet seen fit to declassify such shipboard operations.  However, I don't know why as the reactors aboard the Nimitz are based on over 50 year old designs.

Those guys who work with the Nuclear propulsion equipment are a special breed, aka ""Nukes"".  They work down in the engine rooms, far below decks, deep down in the bowels of the ship.  They have completed a year or more of highly technical training in order to qualify as Rx Operators.  These sailors are some of the most educated people in the Navy, both as officers and Enlisted.  They are hardly the nerdish types while serving in the Navy but often can be seen to glow in the dark.  j/k

The rest of crew was well covered in this documentary.  The reoccurring storyline of various crewmembers, including some of the officers, dealing with family separation issues was very well done.  In this regard, Navy life oboard ship on overseas deployments, has not changed much since my days in the Navy.  It is still quite monotonous, arduous work, and emotionally challenging to be away from your loved ones back home.

The full ten hours of this documentary held my interest and some episodes I felt compelled to watch twice!  Whenever any ""documentary"" can do that, it deserves FIVE STARS.

Kudos to the producers of CARRIER for making such an honest, personal introspective of the Navy, that is both educational AND heart wrenching.

It is a well made, well edited documentary. But I'm not sure if someone who didn't catch at least part of the TV airing would want to sit through ten hours of it?

My beloved Godfather Bart, was tragically killed flying his jet in take off. As a kid, I use to go aboard anchored carriers for visits and dinners.  ""Carrier"" represents the passion, glory, trenches, camaraderie, honors and disciplines of each person aboard. It follows each crew member in exclusive, unique jobs, who does them and why.  Protocols, secrets, parties, missions, danger, hazards.  Men and women working side-by-side in closed conditions with opposing politics.  Women in high ranks.  Races, religions and sexual orientations living tightly.  If you know everything about the Navy, you'll love this.  Flying on the ball? You'll see what that's all about. Never before has a documentary been made of this exacting detail. If you served in the Navy, you must see this. Your keen mind will never observe a repetitive scene.  We pay for the boat, we should see the boat.  Every sailor ends their duty with either of two things: maturity and knowledge of what they want or  don't want to do with their life. You will watch this over and over again, and always have a new understanding of what it means to be an American, and the whole patriotic thing.",1211932800,5,1266,4.892018779342723
3390468,5,B00169E5JQ,"This series is more than learing about navy carriers and how life evolves during a deployment,  This series is a lesson on life itself.  To concentrate on the mechanics of ship and its deployment is only a backdrop for the human element which is coming to terms with the formulation of so many of life's lessons, racial prejudice, discipline, patriotism, rightousness of war, excellence in performance no matter what the job.  Learning all of these things when the ship is described as a floating high schoolis truly amazing.  But, perhaps most heart rendering is the real notion that many aboard have this probable one chance to grab hold of their life and make it count for something bigger than them- the realization that one can be a part of something bigger than themselves and feel good about it. Does anyone think that the sailor that left the ship because he could or would not deal with his racism and learn from it is headed to anything in life that won't haunt him over and over again? To see that happen regardless of how you feel about their mission is truly heart breaking and inspriring at the same time.",1211760000,2,1119,4.636363636363637

3390470,5,B00169E5JQ,"Serving under worst conditions (USS Kitty Hawk CV-63)than the Nimitz, I must say that this documentry has to be the absolute best portrayal of what life is like on an aircraft carrier. Yeah, maybe there was too much focus on just a few of the 5000 ships company and air wing crew members (as mentioned from one of the reviews)... but i'm gonna tell you it only a few people to describe what life is like on a aircraft carrier...it doesn't take all 5000 sailors and marines to tell you what its like. In other words, the director showed enough people do give a full perspective of what life is like on a carrier. Take it from me... I can relate to all of the feelings and opinions that was expressed on the show. On that note, I am very surprised that the Navy allowed that much exposure to be revealed to the public. Usually, they hide this exposure and allow camera crews to look at all the ""good"" aspects of being on a boat (I forgot the name of that show on Discovery which showed how good life is like on the Reagan..and I hear life sucks more on that ship than the Nimitz or even the Kitty Hawk). I am glad that this show was made though. My family now knows the sacrifice, the commitment and the stress that people like myself go through on a daily basis. Anyway: Bravo PBS! I highly recommend this show to anyone who is thinking of joining the Navy... This show puts perspective on the kinds of people you'll meet..all the ups and downs..and opinions of such.

On a side note: the Nimitz and CAG 11 are very lucky that they go on cruise at 18 month (excluding Surge cruises and/crisis) intervals. Kitty Hawk and CAG 5 (aka: me) deploy twice a year. Maybe PBS should've went to Japan and filmed us for a whole year. Now that would be a show!",1211500800,6,1747,4.293939393939394

The player will not use a network drive so if you want to watch it on 2 PCs (which is legal) you have to endure the downloads twice.  I will never ever download an Unbox video again and have told everyone I know that it would be a very bad decision for them to do so.  Amazon ought to be ashamed to present a product like this.

DON'T Download this or any other unbox video.  If you want to see this find it on DVD (maybe through Public TV directly) or some other means.  This is NOT the way",1211414400,3,672,4.076335877862595
3390472,5,B00169E5JQ,"My wife's name may appear as the author of this review.

I was on the maiden cruise for the Nimitz back in 1975, a NATO cruise to the North Atlantic following workups in the Caribbean.  I was then on the first full Med cruise in 1976.

Much has changed aboard the ship, and yet so much is still the same.  The mess deck (chow hall) looks a lot nicer, the workout area far exceeds the dinky gym we had, there is no comparison to our little stores and what is there now, and of course no phone calls or email.  And most notably, no women.

But beyond that I felt like I could nearly recognize many of the sailors and marines portrayed in the show.  The same kind of emotions, doubts, enthusiasm, and bonehead actions were there 30 years ago as are there now.  The documentary did a wonderful job of showing what life on a carrier is like.

And that seemed to be the point of the show.  There are other documentaries, many of which get rather boring, that go through and talk about all the technical aspects of a carrier, but you get the feeling the people there are just a highly evolved ant taking care of the machine.  This documentary showed the people and how it is a microcosm of America.  Very rightly so we often referred to it as the small town of Nimitz, Virginia.

I look forward to passing this DVD set on to my daughter and her family so they can see where I spent a year and change and understand a bit of what my life was like.

3390475,2,B00169E5JQ,"Carrier is a well produced DVD - no question.

The problem, as I see it, is that there is far too much repetition and far, far, too much extraneous material. The endless 'interviews'  with - mostly - the same individuals fails to provide a true overall picture of the thinking of the crew - which numbered over 5,000 souls.

Far to many of those interviewed made me, personally, ashamed to be proud of a Navy and seriously doubtful whether some of the crew of this vast Carrier would perform adequately in times of a 'real' war. The tremendous naivety of more than a few crew members was compounded by the demonstrated ignorance of 'normal' everyday life and living. In this, it must be stressed, it was largely the 'lower deck' and younger crew members who caused this perspective to become most evident. The Officers and Senior Ranks certainly appeared a much better educated and cosmopolitan group of individuals.

The whole programme could have been contained, without loss of interesting or important comment, in a three hour - maximum four hour - programme/DVD.

The actual working life of those aboard was very interesting - but seriously curtailed.

Sadly, for I was keenly anticipating viewing the DVD, I found myself glad it was over!  2 stars out of 5 is the maximum I can, with any conscious, accord this DVD.

Incidentally, the BBC did a similar programme some 30 or so years ago. It was far more to the point - and, therefore, more interesting.",1211068800,13,1458,4.735177865612648
3390476,4,B00169E5JQ,"I watched all 10 hours and it never lost my interest.  Depicted the aduous life of 5500 sailors aboard a warship on overseas deployment.
The ten episodes profile many of the officers and Enlisted, both men and women, from lowest ranking to highest crewmember.  The mixture of fighter pilots to Aviation Boatswain's Mates to Mess Management Specialists to Petty Officers to the Chiefs, is all here.

The only thing missing, quite naturally, was much if anything about the below desks Nuclear Reactors and those highly secretive, wonderous ship's propulsion operations.  Suffice to say, a nuclear carrier, at 90,000+ tons displacement, can operate underway without refueling for decades.

Surprisingly, the U.S. Navy has found a way for the crew, both men and women, straights and gays, to perform some of the most dangerous jobs imaginable.  They work side by side, 24/7, while air ops are underway, but still keep their ""off duty"" personal lives separate; a feat easier said than done under such congested living conditions.  The aircraft carrier and airwings' daily routine are in complete harmony and about efficient as any large organization possibly can be.

I believe this is the best documentary depicting in great detail, what it is really like to be in the Navy, in the history of documentary films.  I should know, I served four years aboard CVN ship during three overseas deployments during the Vietnam War era.  The ""airdale"" (or bird farm) Navy is still a LOT like I remember it from 35+ years ago, except of course, sadly, there were absolutely no women allowed aboard combat ships way back then.

BRAVO PBS for bringing such an interesting, high quality production, both in content as a tribute to America's men and women serving in the Armed Forces, and in format as a the ""HD"" televison production.  ""CARRIER"" was a pleasure to watch from beginning to end.",1210809600,18,1872,4.983922829581994
3390477,5,B00169E5JQ,"I'm a sucker for documentaries. Even though PBS comes in with lots of ghosting and static, I watched the first five episodes, then bought the DVD to watch the rest. My father was a carrier pilot, but beyond that personal connection, it is interesting to see the different military mindsets up and down the ranks. To some extent, our American class structure replicates itself on board the Nimitz. Non-commissioned support grades are highly integrated while command is still largely, though not entirely, white and male. Command staff are generally gung-ho patriotic; Lower ranks are often just as intense but some express, ""It's just a job"" or, ""We're here for the oil"" opinions, too. If Carrier is any indication, the Navy offers full employment, hard work, intense supervision and the sort of camaraderie you don't always find on dry land. That so many of these folk admitted they needed all that is a sad commentary on parenting, schooling and society.

The documentary is definitely character-driven, with some personal revelations drawing gasps from my wife, who identified all too well with the working class element on board. One episode featured a good ol' OK boy that tragically couldn't (or wouldn't) get past his racist upbringing. Another sad moment was the fallout from an inebriated sexual encounter, while on liberty, between two shipmates that barely even knew each other.

Update: I think I can see why some have complained about the personal stories. Whereas the first five or six hours struck a good balance between the requirements of the mission and the personal stories of the crew, the last three or four hours focused almost entirely on personal situations. To some extent this is understandable since the primary mission was completed, but as much as I connected with their stories, all that personal griping did become a bit tedious.",1210636800,8,1859,5.071895424836601
3390478,2,B00169E5JQ,"The Nimitz class aircraft carriers are tremendously fascinating and this series managed to make it boring.  The focus on the private lives of many of the featured crew members was uninteresting and unnecessary.  We don't need an aircraft carrier as the backdrop in order to tell petty stories of personal relationships.  On top of that, the filmmakers focused on what appear to be among the least inspired and satisfied crew members.  To watch this series, I would be left thinking that pretty much everyone in the Navy hates their job and has issues with the command system that has existed in militaries since the beginning of time.  It was not as good as I hoped.",1210464000,4,666,4.756521739130434

3390480,5,B00169E5JQ,"My father worked on aircraft carriers (including the Nimitz), not as a sailor but as an engineer who worked on the designs.  So when I found out this show was airing, I marked my calendar so as not to miss a single episode.  I was not disappointed.  I remember my father describing life aboard aircraft carriers as being like ""a city at sea,"" but I never fully understood what he meant by that until seeing this series.  Of course one of the most exciting, suspense-filled episodes is the one where they show the aircraft taking off and landing.  But the real story that's uncovered is just how much manpower it takes to make that happen.
I was literally moved tears to see the sacrifices these young recruits make, and my heart goes out to them.  All episodes are good but my least favorite of them is episode 8, ""True Believers"" which explores the many faiths on board the Nimitz.  In place of this episode, I would've preferred to see a visit to the ship's hospital or clinic, with interviews with the ship's doctor, dentist, and nurse, to see how the medical personnel fit into the overall scheme of things.  Overall, this series gives an unbiased glimpse into the interworkings of an aircraft carrier that highlights the human element.

3390481,5,B00169E5JQ,"I just watched most of the series off my DVR at one sitting. ""HD Collector's"" anti-pre-review opinion baffles me. We who have seen the show have every reason to review it here. Since this hasn't been released yet, one important reason to do a review here and now is to help encourage Amazon and PBS and whoever to put this series out on the market. Why should they publish it if there's no buzz, no viewer support?
I'm writing this to help get it out there so HDCollector actually has the option of collecting it. Duh.

But also, of course the DVD itself and the extras are worth knowing about, and when/if this comes out I'll report on those aspects. But whether it's a superb DVD set or just average in terms of the extras and the quality of DVD reproduction, at least 90% of the overall value of the set is the content--is what I just watched on my big screen.

And that was amazingly good, as most of the other reviewers have noted--it didn't impose a Navy PR scam or an antiwar screed on the story. You get the an honest, nuanced view of life on an American carrier.

It even got me a little weepy at the end, watching the air controller's reunion with her two kids after moving heaven and earth to get them there.

A truly worthy show, and one other documentarians should watch to see how you can do a great job with the sort of thing that usually just gets a propaganda treatment, either pro or con. The praise from the Navy guys who wrote reviews says it all.
