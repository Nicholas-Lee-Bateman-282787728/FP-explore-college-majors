1623883,3,B00005M1ZM,"Sammy Hagar in Chicago is one hell of a show!!! but the other DVD is just plain crap, okay I must say it has a lot of interesting stuff: Sammy point of view on the web, Sammy's departure from Van Halen, Sammy's hobbies etc. But heck!!! I want the music!!!
Strange this DVD is a cool one to get, the show is amazing, with the ""Waboritas"" a guitarist that makes us wonder if Eddie Van Halen has an afro american brother somewhere, because this guy gives the same guitar power as the famous guitar player. And of course ""Mona"" the bassist who gives a new definition to the ""girl power"" thing so overused on some ""alternative"" circuits.
Sammy and The Waboritas are more popular now than Van Halen, that's for sure!!!
Buy the DVD if you want a good show, but the interview is crappy, anyway if you are a fan of Sammy I think you will enjoy it anyway!!!",999734400,,847,4.3
1623884,3,B00005M1ZM,".... After viewing this DVD, he has lost the edge he displayed on the tours of MTM and RV. Sammy continues to be a great showman - but his choice of changing the arrangement on ""Cabo Wabo"" was a very poor decision. You can tell by the crowd's reaction they weren't pleased either. I think that is the only show I have ever seen where the crowd didn't yell,""You go there once, you be there twice."" They were stunned. The intimate feeling of being at the Cabo Wabo to start the show was what set Sammy apart from everyone else. Equally frustrating was that Sammy laughed in the worst possible time when signing ""Deeper Kinda Love"". Sammy has always been my ""fav"" - always. No opening act - no need to warm up the crowd. Because it's Sammy. The second disk with the interview was very insightful to many of the areas that Sammy has either not discussed in interviews before or touched on lightly. Too bad this DVD wasn't released on the Red Voodoo tour - that would have been magical. ....",998870400,2,986,4.39344262295082
1623885,5,B00005M1ZM,"This must have been a helluva show to have seen in person!!  Sammy still has the chops and the showmanship, and seems to have left behind a lot of his bitterness over his split from Van Halen.  This is two hours of hard rockin' fun, and you can practically taste the Margaritas.  I hope your neighbors like Sammy Hagar's tunes, because I have the feeling you'll want to play this DVD very loud!!!  Sammy embraces the audience very enthusiastically in this performance - he truly loves his fans!
A great show, and a great DVD value.",998265600,,531,4.5
1623886,4,B00005M1ZM,"In spite of his declining record sales, Sammy Hagar keeps being Sammy Hagar and his fans are so grateful!
Sammy writes classic rock'n roll songs and does it his own style; always has. His contributions to Montrose and Van Halen have left their mark in rock'n roll history, and his solo career tried to get off the ground somewhere in between. Not ready to hang up his gloves yet, the self proclaimed Red Rocker has embraced yet another chapter in his career and formed the diverse Waborita band. I was skeptical, but these guys are very good! This DVD provides an entire concert, rightfully focusing on Sammy's best solo work, with 3 Van Halen covers ""top of the world"", ""finish what you started"" and ""why can't this be love"" performed almost flawlessly by the band, and a Montrose era song ""Rock Candy"" is also included.
Sammy seems to be having a blast on stage, I don't care for all the new material, but many of them ""Let Sally Drive"", ""Deeper Kind of Love"", etc.. Are as good as anything he's ever written. The concert DVD alone is worth the price, including doubly digital 5.1 and dts 5.1 sound! But you also get a 2nd DVD which features a 1-hour interview with Sammy.",997660800,4,1174,4.5424528301886795
1623887,5,B00005M1ZM,"This is an awesome DVD! Not only does it include the concert in Chicago, but it also has a great interview with the Red Rocker along with wonderful scenes from Cabo! The DVD captures Sammy and The Wabs doing what they do best,putting on a fantastic show and really getting the crowd into it! It's a great preformance and it really makes you feel like you are part of the show! This is a MUST HAVE for any REDhead and Drooler!",997056000,3,425,4.2592592592592595
1623888,5,B00005M1ZM,"I was at this show when they filmed it & I can guarantee that you will not be disappointed with it. The show has so much energy it's great. Sammy is one man who knows how to 'WOW' a crowd & it shows during this concert. It's 2 hours or so of pure adrenalin rush. It's one of the best shows that I have ever been to & I've been to many Sammy shows over the years. So, go out & buy it...you will be glad you did!
By the way...when Sammy holds up the 'SAMMY HAGAR...MY CHOICE FOR PRESIDENT' banner....well, that's the banner I made. Just thought you'd like to know! hahahahahahaha
REDHEADS RULE!!!!!",996451200,,596,4.191304347826087
1623889,5,B00005M1ZM,"If you have DirecTv, you have seen a preview. I was at the show they filmed this and it was outstanding. I am looking forward to seeing how it came out on DVD.  And enjoying it a second time.",992995200,2,191,3.8974358974358974
1623890,5,B00005M1ZM,"THIS HAS NOT YET BEEN RELEASED, BUT I CAN RATE THIS AS A 10!! BECAUSE I WAS THERE AND IT WAS ALSO BROADCASTED ON DIRECT TV IN THE MONTH OF MAY. THIS SHOW IS SO FULL OF ENERGY, BECAUSE SAMMY AND THE WABORITAS ARE THE BEST BAND AND PERFORMERS!! THEY ARE ONLY OUT TO HAVE A GREAT TIME!! THEY LOVE THEIR FANS AND ONLY WANT THEM TO HAVE A GREAT TIME ALSO!!  I SAY BUY THIS DVD OR VHS AND YOU WILL BECOME HOOKED ON SAMMY AND THE WABORITAS TOO!! MAS TEQUILA!!!!",992649600,3,454,3.9347826086956523
1623892,5,B00005M1ZM,"This is a very good DVD concert with Sammy Hagar and his band. I would have liked to have been at his concert myself, as it looks like a good time. Would recommend.",1359331200,,164,4.0
1623893,5,B00005M1ZM,I like sammy hagar but after seeing this dvd I like him a hole lot more the man can rock&roll and this dvd just kicks butt this is a very well made and great sounding dvd!!!! Worth every penny!!!,1240617600,,195,4.0256410256410255
1623894,5,B00005M1ZM,I thought this was a great two disc set. Only one way to rock lets you see some of sammys guitar playing up close. And his I can drive 55 is always good. I think that the best way to enjoy this album is to have a stereo TV and turn it up. Lot good looking women too! His personal interview shows what a good guy he is. Not many left like Sammy....,1109808000,,347,3.767123287671233
1623895,2,B00005M1ZM,"I review concert dvd's on amazon,always before I purchase them,and I must say,this is the first time I have been let down by the concensus. The lone naysayer who said that production qualities and DTS sound was poor,was right. This is the only concert disc that I have purchased,where the dolby track was better than the DTS track,and the dolby track was mediocre at best. Absolutely no bottom end. The setlist leaned way to heavy on current material,and the Van Hager tunes seemed rushed with Sammy frequently off key,and the band singing the chorus while Sammy catches his breath. My 8 year old is just discovering rock music,and he loves watching these concerts,but this concert is peppered with foul language. I kept fast forwarding to find a track that didn't contain a curse-filled introduction,and when I found one,lo and behold,Sammy would replace vulgarity for lyrics. Scantily clad women is one thing,but the constant potty-mouth banter is lame and 2nd rate. After watching it alone for a second time,and adjusting my system,I still couldn't find anything redeeming about this disc. An X-rated good quality bootleg at best. I returned this one.",1073520000,7,1154,5.078947368421052
1623896,5,B00005M1ZM,"DVD concert of the century! Nobody rocks better than Sammy. This is a must for all fans of music. The Red Rocker is timeless. Sammy's repertoire of material speaks for itself in this performance. Sorry DLR, this stuff is way out of your league!!! I loved Van Halen but the solo material is so much more passionate and real. The Waboritas are without question his best band. Vic Johnson is soooo cool. It would have been nice to see ""3 In The Middle"" included, but nevertheless this concert shreds! Non-stop entertainment, rock's greatest voice, oldest teenager, and coolest frontman. Sit back, grab some tequila, and enjoy over 2 hours of pure rock and roll bliss. You won't be disappointed. The interview disc is very enjoyable also. Cheers.",1063324800,,742,4.850393700787402
1623897,5,B00005M1ZM,"Sammy Hagar is a phenomenon.  He's 55 years old and still rocks like he's 20.  I've seen Sammy live in concert with Van Halen, solo and at Cabo Wabo and he is definately at his best in a small club environment.  Sammy isn't doing it anymore for the money...he's doing it because he loves to perform. How many singers would let fans come onstage with him?  Sammy and his top-notch band shake the rafters in this one.  If you're a Sammy fan, you can't go wrong.",1062979200,2,459,4.290697674418604
1623898,5,B00005M1ZM,i bought the dvd before he came to phoenix and was ready for the show by the time sammy and his great band came to town. the show was an absolutely perfect copy of the dvd. the dvd is as good as any rock performance you'll see and will have you yearning to see sammy and the group in concert.this is a must buy dvd for all avid rock & roll fans!!,1041292800,4,346,3.8194444444444446
1623899,4,B00005M1ZM,"Great show; and being from Chicago I enjoyed it all the more.
The only thing missing were some of Sammy's  older hits from the 70's and 80's.  His newer material is pale in comparison.  The show also ends on a very week song with Sammy singing alone (I do not know how to spell acapella).
Regardless this is a must have view for any Sammy fan...",1018656000,3,345,4.196969696969697
1623900,5,B00005M1ZM,"This is a great DVD.  I've always been a fan of Sammy's, so I'm probably biased to some degree, but this DVD delivers.  The concert is great.  The sound on this DVD is truly amazing.  Sammy covers all the bases of his career, from his early solo outings, to his tenure with Van Halen, to his current rejuvinated solo adventures.  Obviously when a man has such a big body of work, there will always be songs that you wished he would have played, but if he played every song I wanted to hear, it would have to be a five disc collection.  Sammy's concert are always a big party and this is no exception.  You can't help but get wrapped up in the experience when you're watching it.  The second disc is an interview with Sammy and is pretty interesting as well.  He speaks about his career with an honesty that is rare in entertainment these days.  Overall, this is a great DVD, well worth the price of admission and will not disappoint.",1002758400,13,933,4.341040462427745
1623901,5,B00005M1ZM,"Anybody that is a Sammy Hargar fan should buy this DVD. It is one of his best performances ever. I think you should turn off your phone, dim you lights and CRANK up the sound, just sit back and enjoy. If you don't have a good stereo-thats your loss. Sammy Rocks the house down!. OK now lets get technical about it, go in and change you sound settings, if you have 5.1 use it, if not change to 2.1 they both will still blow your ears off. Picture quality is great its a DVD what did you expect. Lets not forget about the bonus disk, the interview with Sammy was a very candid conversation. I really liked the part when he told it like it is about Eddie & Dave being [jerks]. ...  Bottom line is: buy this and you won't be disapointed.",1001635200,5,733,4.125874125874126

7944763,4,B00005M1ZM,"This DVD is worth owning for sure, but Livin' It Up in St. Louis is better in almost every way; better performance, better sound, bette crowed, and better production. This show has more deep cuts, and a second disc with interviews and stuff. You can't go wrong with any live Sammy Hagar. He's kinda like David Lee Roth, but with singing ability, good songwriting, and a better band.

This DVD is a lot of fun and you should buy it. Drink some tequila and let Sammy and Co. have their way with you.",1425772800,,497,4.344086021505376

The ""Red Rocker"" performs some of his best hits, he's written so much good music I wish he could have performed all of it on this dvd, but we know thats Impossible.
