8759020,5,B01EK6LBG6,"I own all four films in their original DVD form, the expensive way compared to this British Film Collection. A bargain if you count the cost per feature. All four are star studded, terrific stories, they type you will watch repeatedly. Each a five-star film with top actors, writing, and cinematography.
A sure fire ""please"" if you buy it and gift it to Brit film lovers. Best buy 2 if you are gifting, you will not want to give away your own copy.",1509753600,3,448,4.409638554216867
