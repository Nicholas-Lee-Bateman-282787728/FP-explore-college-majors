4571302,3,B00553K9T4,"This simple Steinbeck story takes place in the Monterey, California of the early forties.  A little slow and drawn-out, the story involves Tracy and Garfield and their paisano friends and their adventures.  Garfield's inheritance of two houses bring him instant respectability yet estranges him from Tracy and his other pals. Both Tracy and Garfield vie for the affections of lovely Lamarr and become near-enemies in the process.  An entertaining little picture which has Garfield unfortunately miscast as Danny (his Spanish accent was pretty unconvincing) and the part lacked the dynamism for which Garfield was famous for.",960595200,4,624,5.479166666666667
4571303,5,B00553K9T4,"I read the book also like the critic below me but this is a film and one of MGM's finest. It is a wonder to behold. Spencer Tracy's performance as the hapless Pilon is a highlite and John Garfield as Danny is a performance  to treasure. Buying this movie off of Amazon was a refreshment. It has  always been one of my favorite films and will always be. The comments below  mine is from an old book-crone from a person who spends time looking at the  negative points of the film and cannot sit back and enjoy a real classic.
  Victor Fleming's direction (""Gone With the Wind"", ""The  Wizard of Oz"") is truly fashioned in its true existential film about  the life of the ""paisanos"" and Hedy Lammar's performance as  ""Sweets"" Ramirez is her best. See this movie.",938217600,23,758,4.434782608695652
4571314,3,B00553K9T4,"A harmless and leisurely ""adaptation"" of Steinbeck's book.  Though Tracy tries hard, his native intelligence shines through in every scene he's in, which renders his characterization pretty unbelievable.  Same goes for Garfield, whose wooing of Lamarr's ""Sweets"" comes off today as more than just un-PC, including one early scene where he all but forces himself on her.

Pro Fleming does his best, and it's interesting to see him working on a lower budget than usual.  The cheapo studio backgrounds really take the viewer out of the scenes in which they are utilizing (the background painting of the town early on wouldn't pass muster in a college art class).  Clearly, despite the cast, crew, and source material, MGM was saving money right and left on this one.  A few second-unit shots from up Monterey way would have greatly helped the film's verissimilitude.

That said, everyone tries their damndest, Frank Morgan is great, and Hedy Lamarr steals the film, even from Tracy (no small feat).",1447200000,,995,5.067484662576687

This is a story about the Paisanos of Monterey, told through three friends, Pilon, Danny, and the Pirate, all who live a carefree life of drinking and parties until Danny's life takes a surprising turn when he inherits two houses making him ""A man of property"". Danny soon meets a cannery worker named ""Sweets"", played to the hilt by the historically beautiful Hedy Lamarr. The tension between Garfield and Lamarr is at its best as they both fight the attraction they feel for each other.

4571347,4,B00553K9T4,"This motion picture adaptation of the story by John Steinbeck is apparently the only version.  That is somewhat surprising as it is a somewhat classic tale.  It is the story about a group of layabouts led by a character played by Spencer Tracy.  They try to survive by mooching rather than working and, when one of their group inherits from his grandfather, they move in to share in their friend's good fortune.  It is considered a sin for one of their group to actually take a job, even though jobs are available (the motion picture was filmed in 1942 after the economy had picked up following the Great Depression).  Marriage is to be avoided, because that would cause a man to work.

Some characters come across much stronger than others and tend to carry the motion picture forward.  Overall, it is not five star, but is worth watching.  It was filmed in black and white without the benefit of modern special effects

For a more recent story about a moocher, there is Bosco Dorff in ""Murder...Suicide...Whatever.""",1287705600,5,1017,4.732954545454546
4571348,1,B00553K9T4,"I saw this movie on TCM. The Hispanic guest commentator was not impressed and neither was I. He spoke about it as if it was a train wreck, and, frankly, it's difficult to disagree.

The extremely low-budget flick was pretty much a total waste of time and certainly a waste of talent. Spencer Tracy must have looked back on his illustrious acting career replete with two Oscars and many more Oscar nominations and wondered why he ever accepted the role. But even he wasn't consistent with his accent; it was all over the place.

I thought it was insulting to Hispanics the way Tracy kept tricking them with simple tricks.

I found it very difficult to give a damn about any of the characters. They were not properly developed. Even the early storyline about inheritance is ridiculously rushed.

Hedy Lamarr does okay with her role and she is there for some kind of romantic subplot, but most of the time she's angry at the man who wants her and she ends up marrying. When she's not telling him to get away from her after he shows up at work, or the time he forces himself on her (sexual harassment), and gets out her knife, threatening to cut him to pieces, she's slapping him across the face for a rude remark he made about her being happy to marry anyone who has money.

But then there's a huge jump from the non-relationship to them getting married at the end. What did he ever do for her? He bought her a vacuum cleaner (which she couldn't even use because her house didn't have electricity). That's one of my pet peeves about old ""romance"" in movies. The men and women do and say very little but somehow they're suddenly madly in love. O-kay. What-ever. It must be nice to be so easily impressed.

Most of the characters had bad manners. The best behaved of the lot are the dogs.",1242518400,3,1783,4.45398773006135

Spencer Tracy, John Garfield and Hedy Lamarr are regrettably miscast in this disappointing adaptation of John Steinbeck's 1935 novel.

4571350,1,B00553K9T4,"I just can't get enthralled about a book/movie that attempts to find humor and lightheartedness in alcoholism and poverty. The characters are lazy, shiftless do-nothings who give a bad name to the human race.",1180915200,5,208,5.147058823529412
4571351,2,B00553K9T4,"Over last summer, I read Tortilla Flat by John Steinbeck.  On Saturday, October 1, 2005, I watched the movie Tortilla Flat starring Spencer Tracy, Hedy Lamarr, and John Garfield and directed by Victor Fleming.  While I watched the movie, I was confused.  I wondered why Victor Fleming seemingly scrapped half the book and added a knew ending to the story.  Victor could have called it ""Tortilla Flat's beginning, and then whatever I feel like doing."" Not only that, but he focused in on a character mentioned in only a few pages in the book, and made her the supporting actress of the movie.  The movie completely changes the book, and is not nearly as good.

 When I first read Tortilla Flat, I thought it was strange and intriguing.  It is based on the lives of a group of vagrant mixes of California's original Hispanic settlers and the newly arriving ones and takes place on the central coast of California.  Danny and his friends are living on the streets, but then Danny inherits two houses from his grandfather.  At first, the group continues with their bad ways.  One of Danny's friends cheats him out of his fair rent for one of his houses, and ends up wasting his money on himself.  This continues for a while, until one night, the house that Danny's renting burns down when Danny's friends forget to put out a candle. (It also was the will of the saints that frequent the book).  Then, Danny's friends decide to become real friends, and give up their bad ways for better ones.  They become somewhat like robin hood and his band of merry men.

 The movie's storyline is extremely different.  In the beginning, it's the same, but when the house burns down, Danny's friends don't change their bad ways.  A person they helped to live a better life in the book is a target for thieving in the movie, until they find out that he promised his money to a saint.  Also, Sweets Dolores, a character mentioned only as a part of a brief adventure where Danny's friends help him overcome difficulties in the book, is the person Danny falls in love with in the movie.  Also, the ending is totally changed.  In the book, the characters have to overcome great grief and still do the right thing, but the movie has a fairy tale ending with everyone happy.

 The question arises, ""Why did they change the movie so much?"" The answer is quite simple, and equally foolish.  The people writing the script thought that if there was a tragedy in the end like in the book, people wouldn't want to see the movie.  I think that idea is completely wrong.  It usually makes a movie better if the ending is realistic.  There's also a reason why they spent so much time on Sweets Delores: sex appeal and a love interest.  They needed a sexy girl in the movie, so that there was some eye candy; and they needed love interest so that a larger audience would be attracted to the movie.  They shouldn't have totally changed the book.  Although they had to shorten the book for the movie, they should've at least included some more of the adventures, and kept its ending.

 I believe that the book is better then the movie.  It's deeper, showing the change in Danny and his friends from bums to heroes of their community.  It's more interesting, showing the many exploits of Danny and his friends.  It's more touching, going through tragedy and happiness, rather then having a fairy-tale ending.  It's better written and more interesting, rather then being totally predictable.  It's, of course, more descriptive, because no movie can match a book in that category.

 To summarize this review in a few words, I'd have to say that the movie Tortilla Flat butchers the book and turns it into a new creation that goes by the same name.  John Steinbeck would be angry at this movie.",1128211200,9,3753,4.593373493975903

4571353,5,B00553K9T4,"It's true that it's nearly impossible to make John Steinbeck's stories into movies. I had the advantage of having read Tortilla Flat before seeing this movie version. In cinema you have the visual facet of storytelling. You cannot go verbatim into film. Some things get mis-translated. Those who had a hand in making this film knew exactly where to take it. That or it was plain old blind luck. I could tell they knew the story well. They knew how to retell it in movie form. That was their strength.  Black and white is like alchemy for many nowadays, but back then it was already a refined art. For the whole movie i hadn't noticed that it was in black and white. You don't yearn for color when all the elements of lighting, composition, tonal range, everything, tricks your mind into perceiving color. All of the characters were engaging and alive. The story took me in, into Monterey. It's a story of people who have very little, but in their friendships are more well off than the very wealthy. If you watch this movie before you read the book, it is just as well. You won't miss much by not reading the book. The movie is that good.",972777600,36,1138,4.471153846153846

8457402,5,B00553K9T4,"I enjoyed this film very much in spite of its simplicity. It takes place in central California in a community of Mexican workers although it's major characters, such as Danny and Pilon, are bumbs who avoid working at all costs and seem content with their poverty. Things change when Danny inherits from his uncle two houses and allows his friends to live with him in one of the houses. Besides that, Danny begins to think about aspirations for life when he meets a beautiful Mexican neighbor, Delores, played by the stunningly beautiful Hedi Lamar. When he buys Delores a vacuum cleaner, Pilon feels that his existence as a bumb is threatened and makes his moves to cause grievances between Danny and Delores. There is also another subplot: a man named Pirate who sells wood to collect money so that he can buy a candle for St. Francis of Asis, who healed one of his dogs. Pirate's story is quite moving and full of piety. Frank Morgan plays this role quite well.

This is a story about redemption for its major players. It has a happy ending, but it does move one's feelings without being a tear jerker.
