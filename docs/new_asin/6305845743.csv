The Try adventure continues, with Xelloss and Filia still arguing and the second episode has Zelgadiss narrating in the beginning!  In the third episode we see more into Valgaav's depressing past and how he met Gaav.  It's a very satisfing tape.  If you've never seen The Slayers in subtitles, this is a great time to start.  Everyone's voice character is well casted.  Make sure to buy this tape!",969840000,,489,4.682352941176471

The first three episodes (especially the first one!) out of the four on this tape are absolutely HILARIOUS. I'd heard things about how far the  arguments between Filia and Xellos went, and I still cracked up laughing.  Filia's character is absolutely PRICELESS, I fell in love with her right  away-- and we see Jillas and Gravos again, our favorite adorable little  lackies. The last episode, however, really had me stunned-- basically  courtesy of Valgarv (Valgaav), the main villain of Try. Let's just say a  little something is revealed that shows that the Golden Dragons aren't  quite all they're cracked up to be... Oh yes, and as usual, the dub actors  do a wonderful job-- and I'm still impressed with the quality of the voices  of Tara Jayne and Scottie Ray (Filia and Valgarv, respectively.) At any  rate, I loved this tape, and it left off with a total bang of revelations  and future plot pushers. Can't wait for Try, Volume 3!",961718400,3,1014,4.7371428571428575
8492311,5,6305845743,"From the beginning of this next installment in the Slayers Universe, I was impressed by the animation, which seems to have not only continued the style of the first two arcs, but actually improved. The music, which has  been top-notch for the most part, is as catchy as ever with great opening  and ending songs. Both are sung by the talented Megumi Hayashibara, which  is enough to recommend it by itself.  Slayers is a story set in a  pseudo- medieval world with all the typical sword-and-sorcery trappings of  the fantasy genre. With a twist. Slayers rarely, if ever takes itself  seriously, and will set you laughing if you have the least sense of humor.  This volume introduces a new character, Filia, who seeks the famous  ""genius sorceress"" and bandit-killer Lina Inverse, and  re-acquaints us with some old ones, Zelgadis the chimera, Gourry the  ""idiot swordsman"", Princess Amelia, and Xelloss, the trickster  priest. The episodes contain everything from a fight with a dragon to a  battle with a bandit gang to the destruction of a city! But it all ends  well, and Filia joins the reluctant Lina and her friends on a quest to save  their world and get a decent meal.",960768000,5,1176,4.781094527363184
