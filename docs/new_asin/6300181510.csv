221730,4,6300181510,"Earthquake realistically shows us the devastating effects of such an event on a large modern day city. Since movie studios didn't have the resources in 1974 to add expensive computerized effects, miniatures, camera trickery  and a few large-scale destructions were used to simulate the quake.  However, even by today's standards, most (but not all) effects are very  effective. Many of the buildings we see crumbling to the ground are actual  locals in Los Angeles and anyone living is this area (myself included)  would still find watching this film chilling to say the least. The sets are  very impressive - they made one helluva mess of Universal Studios making  this movie. The acting is so-so, and the ending is a little disappointing  and leaves us with a lot of unanswered questions: what ever happened to  Miles and Rosa's brother anyway? But as far as pure disaster entertainment  goes, this film has it all.",930182400,3,917,4.973684210526316

221765,4,6300181510,"I just finished watching my new Blu
Ray of Earthquake. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the sensurround track. I have a Dennon surround 875 watt 5.1 system. Also a
Polk 350 watt subwoofer. When the quake happen in the picture it shook the whole room. I
Could feel it hit my chest.
  The picture quality is also very good. As far as disaster movies go it holds up pretty well if you can take all of the soap it offers.
  I gave this 4 out of 5 stars because I feel that they had to many big name stars with nothing to
Move the story forward. All in all a very good action and special effects movie for it's time.",1512864000,2,625,4.056910569105691

221821,1,6300181510,"It's not the movie I hate, it's this blu ray. The picture is grainy, and a lot of scenes have been cut out. The original runtime of this film was 160 minutes. This blu ray only runs 123 minutes. The last time I saw this film is when I was 8 years old back in the 70's. I happened upon the blu ray while shopping other blu rays here on Amazon. I was really excited to see it again after all these years only to be disappointed to see the grainy picture, and some memorable scenes like the jet airliner landing during the earthquake, and struggling to take back off, cut out of the film. Why Universal? Why would you destroy such a great film for the blu ray release?",1489881600,5,665,4.123076923076923
221822,5,6300181510,More realistic than any of the new disaster movies being made last few years.

221825,3,6300181510,This is okay for this type of movie.  One of the run of disaster movies from the '70s.  Not as good as I think The Poseidon Adventure or The Towering Inferno.  I saw this when I was 15 at the theater.  And the theater did feel like it was shaking.  And the movie is better then the recent San Andreas.  A mega earthquake hits Los Angeles and building fall down and people get killed.  And the survivors try to escape.  Some of the buildings and debris looks cheesy.  And I really like the casting Ava Garner plays Charlton Heston's wife.  Which isn't too bad.  But she is also Lorne Greene's daughter.  Weren't they all pretty close to the same age. Anyway take that for what it is.  And toward the end I was cheering that Genevieve Bujold would make it.  And Ava Garner wouldn't.  This is a good enough way to kill some time on a day when you have time.,1488499200,,854,4.217391304347826

221891,4,6300181510,"Still holds up after all these years. Yes, there is some of the 70s schlock, like soap-opera plot lines, overacting, and what are now considered stereotype characters. But it is still suspenseful and entertaining. The special effects remain impressive, especially considering they involve physical models since they had no CGI. A few are cheesy, but that's okay. I remember seeing it in Sensurround in the theater, which involved installing extra subwoofers for enhanced low frequency rumble, which is just what you need with an earthquake movie, right? Well, it was a mildly amusing gimmick in the theater, and not very convincing. You don't miss it here. And, it's good to see many stars in their earlier years, although Ava Gardner looked old and stretched. Her overly dramatic acting didn't help, either, considering hers was not a very likable character to begin with. In many ways, Earthquake helped set the stage for more modern epic disaster movies, so it is well worth seeing to get some perspective on how this genre has evolved.",1466294400,3,1039,5.046511627906977

221910,3,6300181510,"Where are all the deleted scenes?? There are LOTS OF THEM, and none are included here. Rip-off.
Here's a summary:
After October test screenings, Universal opted to cut 30 minutes from the film, notably from the pre-quake sequences, at the cost of some of the dramatic flow. This included a narration sequence about the San Andreas fault and an impending catastrophic earthquake that would occur in either Los Angeles or San Francisco. This scene was filmed and was set to be shown before the opening title credits, and while it was removed at the last minute, it was eventually included as the opening sequence of the NBC extended television edit. Also excised was extended footage of Stewart (Heston) running, and additional scenes of Remy (Gardner) and Stewart arguing. After Remy's fake suicide, Dr. Vance shows up, argues with the ambulance crew, and begins to talk with Stewart. Dr. Vance (Lloyd Nolan) informs Stewart that Remy had an abortion two years prior. Stewart realizes that Remy had lied to him, since he was told it was a miscarriage. Remy appears and they fight because Stewart wanted the baby and Remy did not. Stewart storms off, and this explains why Stewart resents Remy so much. (In the film, they just seem angry at one another.) There was more of Slade leaving the police station and footage of Rosa leaving the market was shot as well. She was filmed waiting for a bus, and being offered a lift from a man on a motorcycle (this footage was eventually used in the film's television cut). Just before the earthquake, Stewart and Remy had a final fight (in front of Stewart's car) which was deleted as well. During the earthquake, there was a scene of a nearby lumberyard falling apart, and this was removed from the final cut.
The elevator scenes, some of the film's most infamous shots, were severely altered from their original scenes. Originally, the occupants ended up pressed to the ceiling of the elevator and dropped to the floor when the elevator crashed to the bottom of the shaft. This scene - shown in all test screening prints - was considered too graphic for a film intended to have a PG rating.[citation needed] Universal, decided to cut this portion of the sequence and replace it with a frame of the people on the elevator's floor, with the notorious 'cartoon blood' rushing into the camera.
Other deleted scenes were shot to wrap up many characters' stories after the earthquake. Walt Russell and Dr. Stockle  whose fates are undetermined after the quake in the theatrical release  were shown alive in the seismology laboratory post-quake. They were shown finding the earthquake's magnitude to be 9.9 on the Richter scale. The film's final scene originally had Denise asking Lew Slade if Stewart had survived; upon hearing of his death, she walks over to Corry who has regained consciousness.",1463184000,5,2832,4.873443983402489

221943,5,6300181510,"What is really ""cheesy"" about this movie is the Amazon.com review of this 1970s classic. What a biased, negative opinion by a supposed ly knowledgeable representative of your company, one who probably has never experienced a real earthquake, and likely wasn't even born when this movie first came out.  Just because it comes from an earlier era, starring some of the finest actors in motion picture history, and relies on old-school special effects, and the skills of the actors and directing crew--with absolutely NO CGI--that doesn't make it a bad movie.  It was certainly more realistic 40 years ago than The Rock's San Andreas was in 2015. Even Dr Lucy Jones laughed at that ridiculous CGI movie. I've seen Earthquake at least a dozen times in 40 years. And I'm ordering it again on DVD (because someone borrowed and kept my original DVD, and I can no longer play the VHS version) so I will watch it another dozen times, and enjoy every minute of it.

221977,3,6300181510,"I just watched this for the first time since I saw Earthquake in the theatres back in the 70's. I watched it with my expectations low and my opinion was that it was OK but nothing special, even though the effects were special for the 70's. The earthquake lasted quite awhile but what surpised me is that it ended half way through the movie with just one short aftershock after that. The remainder of the movie was just survival and rescue scenes.

It was actually kind of fun nitpicking the effects during the earthquake, like watching those houses on stilts come down with nothing inside of them. Genevieve Bujold seemed to be in no hurry to dodge those electrical wires.

Third 70's movie in a row that I've seen Marjoe Gortner and I'm convinced more than ever that he is a terrible actor...and just how the hell did he get  all his parts anyway.
Watch the seen with Richard Roundtree going around that loop (well...his double anyway). Nice cutaway by the editing room as he clearly did not make it around. Even though they made it look like he completed the loop...half way around he went off the ramp. Back in the 70's when no VHS or DVD existed you could get away with this as you couldn't stop the movie.

Seems like Charlton Heston decided he was going to die in every movie he did after Planet of the Apes. Mostly wasted star power with too many stars and not enough to do. The movie does hold up fairly well for a non CGI movie in a CGI world.

It was right up there, in its own manner, with the huge mistake that the writers/producers of ""San Andreas"" made at THAT movie's very end.  (The fact that both films involved earthquakes is only very coincidental, to the point being made here.)  Up until those final minutes, when seeing each of those movies for the first time, I'd actually harbored the fervent hope that AT LAST there were people in Hollywood who could WRITE.  But alas, once again, in both cases, they proved their DEFICIENCY of capability to deliver a truly SHOCKING twist!  Unbelievable!  Well... no... actually, all TOO believable!  Hackneyed and predictable business as usual.  Sad!!.

221995,5,6300181510,"EARTHQUAKE...one can now say THIS is the ""Granddaddy"" of all Earthquake movies. I was 8 when this came out, so I didn't get to see it in the theater, but I do recall it on TV. There is a TV version with a few added scenes not featured here. THIS IS the Theatrical Version. So, if you remember an airplane taking off from LAX with an actress and her husband sitting in the plane looking out the window, then showing the TV audience the huge cracks, THAT is the TV version. Universal has only released this thus far on DVD and Blu-ray, the theatrical version.

The picture looks good even on the All-New Digitally Remastered DVD with 5.1 Surround Sound, plus the ""so called"" Sensurround. I wouldn't put much faith into that last one, of course. Other reviewers here have said that it is not the real Sensurround in the first place.

This movie came out at a time when you either had the ""Nature Gone Wild"" theme going or the ""Disaster"" theme. There were plenty in the decade of the 1970s to go around. lol  I watched them all. Most of them had a huge all star cast. Actresses and Actors of the ""Day"", this movie was no exception.
I probably wouldn't recommend this to the generation under 25 years of age. They would be looking for CGI effects and the like. This movie used ""Practical"" effects, since CGI was over 10 years away, at least. (The Young Sherlock Holmes, 1985).

The movie did win 4 Academy Awards for Sound, Visual Effects and two technical awards. So, it wasn't a ""bust"" in that regard. The acting, well, I wouldn't put it on par with the likes of GWTW or TWOZ. lol It was okay and had some good moments and some cheesy ones. The lovely AVA GARDNER, always ready for a fight, does it here with lead man Charlton Heston. They all have their own lives, but come in contact with each other through the course of this disaster of ""epic"" proportions.
My favorite scene is the one where the man looks out from ""his building"" window (what's left of it) only to see the Capitol Records building losing a chunk of it.
I enjoy this movie along with the other disaster movies of the decade, including AIRPORT '75 (Charlton Heston, Karen Black), AIRPORT '77 (Jack Lemmon, James Stewart), THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, THE TOWERING INFERNO. So, be sure to check those out as well.",1453680000,4,2273,4.469879518072289

221998,4,6300181510,"SOME---if not most---of these reviews are over ten years old, and are for a DVD.
I bought t-h-i-s Blu-ray in 2016, and watched it TODAY.
The picture has been cleaned up to appear to be MUCH newer than its actual
screening-date in 1974.
You have the choice of watching this in DTS 5.1 Surround, or 2.1 Sensurround...
a somewhat modified 5.1. ...and it's also a few other languages.
I watched the movie on a 55"" Sony TV with a Bose 5.1 Surround System.
Of course, this was filmed before the advent/invent of Digital F/X---extensive mini-
atures, and crude matte paintings, so, the MAIN reason for watching it is seeing the
stars: Ava Gardner, George Kennedy, Lorne Greene, Genevi&egrave;ve Bujold, Richard
Roundtree, Marjoe Gortner, Barry Sullivan, Lloyd Nolan and Victoria Principal, Look
for Walter Matthau---credited as: ""Walter Matuschanskayasky""--- playing a mumbling
drunk. In the credits after him is a guy Bowery Boys fans will recognize as Gabe Dell---
(the Bowery Boys' romantic lead [with the dimpled chin] billed as Gabriel Dell).
Actors DO change their names. Thomas Cruise Mapother, IV is known as Tom Cruise...
HE isn't in this, but there ARE a lot of explosions and rumbles!
Well, anyway, the audio was crisp; the picture was pristine; the SFX were, well... it IS a
42-year-old ""bomb"", but CURIOSITY has to give it a few extra stars to pad out a TV-movie-
of-the-week's quality flick, BECAUSE of the sensurround. This is just a few minutes over 2-
hours, and is NOT the padded, TV, version.

I didn't LOVE it, but, I DID like it. I'm 67, so I was just 25 when I first saw it... a couple years
after returning from Vietnam. I'm thinkin'... if YOU are 25---now---you'd probably rather see
a newer Asylum earthquake movie; if you're old enough to KNOW the names of ANY of the
stars I mentioned [other than Tom], give it a chance to shake your home theater: I watched
it with MY sound on 75 of 100.",1453161600,17,1908,4.72972972972973

And what's interesting is Mario Puzo wrote the screen play and I'm surprised he never wrote a disaster novel he should have. And this film should be added to Charlton Heston unofficial apocalypse trilogy. Maybe call it Charlton Heston Apocalypse!

222086,5,6300181510,"Watching films such as this have to be viewed realizing that all the effects had to be staged using polystyrene
and models, not having the benefit of the virtual reality today's technology brings to the screen.
With a cast of many of the big-names of the day this apocalyptic movie was certainly a must-see back then, as
the returns at the box-office clearly shows.
The film tells of a catastrophic 'Earthquake' in the Los Angeles region of California...........
After a series of mini-quakes many begin to believe the 'Big-One' was imminent.......do the authorities cause wide
-spread panic by making the findings of seismologists public.
When the devastation occurs it see's people trapped in buildings people buried by falling debris...panic and confusion,
with unlikely heroes emerging in the face of adversity including 'Graff's' (Charlton Heston) father-in-law 'Royce' (Lorne
Greene) who at great risk to himself helps many of his staff escape his badly damaged Office block.
Many are drawn to an underground car-park where emergency measures are in-place including medical attention and
food, however after a strong after-shock those in the temporary shelter become trapped.
'Graff' who's wife 'Remy' (Ava Gardner) and indeed lover 'Denise' (Genevieve Bujold) and son 'Corry' (Tiger Williams)
are among those trapped is helped by LAPD Officer 'Slade' (George Kennedy)
(a drunk brilliantly portrayed by 'Walter Matthau' barely felt the Earth move)
However, the danger is not over for many of the trapped and indeed their heroic rescuers.
The film was produced and released in 1974 given which the Blu-ray upgrade is actually pretty good, the special-effects
impressive for that time......though many would argue perhaps a little dated....still worth a re-visit in my view.
* Must admit, am looking forward to the special-effects blockbuster 'San-Andreas' though of course not wishing for the
reality's of that particular 'Time-Bomb' which would of course be devastating for the highly populated region.",1435104000,,2008,5.459807073954984

222090,3,6300181510,"I had not watched this movie for a number of years and then watched it recently to see how it compared with 2015's ""San Andreas"".  The special effects, which were top notch in 1974, are still pretty good.  The story, which is secondary to the title event, has held up pretty good.  The performances are alright though the scenes with people have a dated feel to them.  This may be because there are so many well known stars of the 60s and 70s present , all wearing dated 70s clothing, that it feels like being back in that time period.  Chuck Heston grimaces and gnashes his teeth in nearly every scene.  Ava Gardner appears to be trying harder to save her career than to save her life.  Lorne Green seems out of place as he was more of a TV star than a movie actor.  Marjoe Gortner gives an uncomfortably realistic performance as a psychopath.  George Kennedy as an overwhelmed cop is probably the most believable performance.  One weakness the film has is that it does not know how to end.  When the star of the movie is the devastating earthquake and the earthquake is over, there is no where to go.  Spoiler Alert: (if spoiler alerts are needed on movies that are 40 years old)  Heston and Gardner  literally get flushed down the sewer and everyone else just wanders off...fade to credits.",1434412800,4,1293,4.493562231759657

222116,5,6300181510,"The ""big one"" finally hits Los Angeles, and we are there! Of course, there's a huge build-up before the catastrophe.

When it does occur, the destruction is fairly underwhelming, and the aftermath is rather anticlimactic. The highlights include an ancient Lorne Green's demise, George Kennedy (AIRPORT, AIRPORT '75, JUST BEFORE DAWN) as a washed-up cop, a mustache-less Richard Roundtree as a stunt motorcyclist, and Marjoe Gortner (FOOD OF THE GODS, STARCRASH) as a National Guardsman gone completely bananas!

the new HD transfer does look incredible in 2:35:1 widescreen, very sharp & clear picture quality for sure no Grain or Dirt
and the sound quality has been boosted with both 5.1 Master audio mix & 2.0 master stereo mix
which does sound incredible through my surround sound system
but tragically no special features except for the original trailer
not even a behind the scenes TV promo of the film from 1974, no Deleted scenes either & there's lots of Deleted scenes from the film
when Earthquake was Broadcast to TV back in the 70's, extra scenes were filmed for 1 night TV broadcast
making the runtime about 145mins so around extra 26mins of extra scenes were filmed just for the TV version
there's some scenes of a married couple on a plane flying into L.A.X, some scenes of the plane landing near missing
an earthquake tremmor on the runway, more scenes with Rosa, and other scenes
i have a bootleg DVD copy of the 1:33:1 TV version so the picture quality is about 7/10 so Definitely tolerable to watch
the dvd copy i was able to get must've been from a master tape source
 the extra 26mins of scenes are definitely entertaining scenes for sure, but only for Big fans of this Disaster film
for some reason Universal didn't bother adding the Deleted scenes as extras on this blu-ray, which they definitely should have for sure

Directed and produced by Mark Robson. Written by George Fox and Mario Puzo.

Inspired by the real-life earthquake that struck Sylmar/San Fernando Valley in California on February 9, 1971 at 6:01am. It was a 6.7.

One of the most popular all-star cast disaster genre movies of the 1970's. Theater. audiences were able to hear this movie in ""SENSURROUND"".

It is a nice, sunny morning in Hollywood, California and Graff (Charlton Heston) is out having his morning jog, but when he returns home to continue exercising, his wife, Remy (Ava Gardner), wants to start a spat. He is getting tired of her. After he showers, she is found on the bed gasping for air. Finding a bottle of pills, he quickly calls the doctor. He later sees the pills from the bottle in the toilet. She was faking it. Just then an earthquake strikes and then another.
  The people of Los Angeles are in for a great earthquake today. The biggest earthquake they have ever experienced in their life in Southern California.

222225,5,6300181510,"This is a great disaster movie from the high point of the genre in the 70's.  I love the Irwin Allen classics like Poseidon and Towering Inferno but this is the best one from Universal.  Mario Puzo laid out a great story and Mark Robson did a superb job directing.  In my opinion it is generally better than a lot of the other big movies from the era put out by Universal and often producer Jennings Lang-the Airports, Two Minute Warning, etc to me did not have the overall success as a movie this one did.  The cast is top notch and it has enough twists and turns to keep it interesting, while also providing some depth to the characters.  Charlton Heston, George Kennedy, Genevieve Bujold, Ava Gardner, Lorne Greene, Richard Roundtree, and Victoria Principal are all superb in their parts-and the special effects used to depict an earthquake still hold up pretty well.  It has all the same conventions which also highlight some of the lesser disaster films, but the writing and directing on this one lift it up above the usual failings that come to Universal Pictures movies, especially from this era.  They were usually better at television and typically it showed in their movies, but every so often they would spend money on top talent behind the camera and get a rare gem like this.  Highly recommended for fans of classic popcorn entertainment-if you liked Towering Inferno, Poseidon Adventure, Superman, Jaws, Star Wars, etc, you should find some big enjoyment from this as well.",1418256000,,1487,4.7587548638132295

222227,2,6300181510,As a survivor of a 9.2 earthquake I thought this was pretty stupid movie. As I recall in the movie the earthquake was supposed to be 9.9. People were running in the streets screaming. In an earthquake of that size you cannot stand on our feet. Believe me--I know--I've been there. Also it was more on people's affairs. I would have rather seen a movie about survival. In my experience with the 9.2 earthquake I could have written a story about how several families got together that night and how we helped each other and supported each other.,1417478400,,543,4.551020408163265

It did not disappoint even though after watching the first few minutes that I had seen it before, more than a couple of times but not in recent years.  Back in 1974, it probably would have rated 5 stars. It is a keeper.",1412726400,,352,4.014285714285714
222265,4,6300181510,"I have waited for Earthquake to come out on blu ray for awhile, and I finally picked up a copy. I remember seeing this originally at my local movie theater with my father. And I did see the movie with the Sensurround sound. I remember the whole theater shaking. I was thrilled and a little scared too. I did pick up copies of the film on video, laserdisc, and dvd. But of course blu ray is the highest quality now, so I wanted that in my collection. I am not dissapointed. The movie is only mediocore and the special effects are good, even considering this film was made before digital effects came along. That does add a little more realism to the film. Only Charlton Heston and George Kennedy stand out. The rest of the cast try but because of a weak script and only fair acting, this is not my favorite disaster movie. I will however give the review for the technical merits of the blu-ray. The video here is good, although a little too much grain. It does not detract from the enjoyment of the movie tho. Transfer is clean, and color is very good. Good details also. You have 2 choices on the audio. a DTS HD 5.1 surround soundtrack or a 2.1 DTS with Sensuround. I picked the 2.1 audio because that is the original sensuround and it still sounds good. My walls were shaking during the earthquake scenes. Bravo to Universal for restoring the original audio back. Unfortunately there are NO extra's. Not even the original trailer or any original featurettes. Nothing. So all in all, a excellent job with good video and excellent audio, just don't expect any more than that.",1412208000,,1575,4.491289198606272
222266,3,6300181510,"Well, Earthquake is OK.  It was a big budget movie with major stars.  However, the storyline was a bit contrived.  Such as Charlton Heston's love interest, his wife's reaction to the situation, Lorne Green's big business attitude not to mention George Kennedy's role as a L A policeman .  But, Greene stepped up to the plate after the earthquake.  He helped people get out of his building.  Originally, Universal billed this movie with its version of updated movie sound called Sensoround (sp??).  Universal dropped the sound system.  It was too expensive for the movie theaters, somewhat like Disney's Fantasound for Fantasia.  But, the movie deserves a viewing.  Having lived through a real earthquake, Universal did depict the earthquake quite realistically.  It used to be (and may still be) an attraction at the Los Angeles theme park.  So, have a look at Earthquake especially if you never experienced an earthquake.",1411430400,3,922,5.114093959731544
222267,4,6300181510,"I would have bought this long ago but was scared off by the multiple complaints on graininess - which i absolutely hate, but it is not that bad. YES, the first opening scene is a blue sky shot, very dingy looking and lots ""mosquitoes"" flying around...... but that is only a few seconds in the movie.  For that matter there is probably only 30 MAYBE 60 seconds of the entire film looks like this, and a few other scenes that are slightly grainy, and the rest looks more or less what you would expect an older movie remastered to blu-ray to look like. Yes the sky can look bad once in a while, but all the rest of the time it looks much better/cleaner than even a good DVD can look like. It is not up to the 'James Bond' remasters, but this is not THAT bad.... and i would not wait around for another remastering of this film, because it probably won't happen nor would be worth the wait, it was long enough for this one.

I was fine with the sound, i prefer the default 5.1 - the sensuround sound thing i felt had even worse bass and the dialog was just too buried and flat, for what it is and how it was originally recorded and this type of movie, the default audio is just fine. no complaints. Nice closed captioning as well.

This also has an automatic repeat function which i like, there is a minor pop menu if you hit the button on your remote, otherwise it just goes directly in the movie and after the credits just goes back into the movie again. No special features/featuretts what so ever.

Yes this could have been a little better, but it is what it is now and you probably won't get it better.  There is both a little under and over acting, typical for the 70's, but not as bad if had been shot in the 60's..... all and all i like this movie, of which i recommend as well as this blu-ray version.

This is a fun standard disaster movie. The models of buildings and dams are hockey and could have used some good CGI, but what can you expect in 1974? As in any big disaster movie there are plenty of popular actors from that era. Be sure to look at the big hair and 70's clothing and cars.

222326,3,6300181510,"In this notable disaster film from 1974, a series of tremors begins to strike Los Angeles, California. Then the big one hits that leaves wide scale destruction across the city. Following several different characters played by big-name actors of the day, we see how the average lives of people are suddenly changed by the catastrophe.

First the good. Probably the best reason to see the film is the fantastic special effects that show not only the earthquake itself but also the destruction of the aftermath. Long before CGI, everything had to be made using miniatures and other tricks. These effects, for the most part, still hold up reasonably well today. Also of note is the use of detailed matte paintings showing L.A. destroyed after the quake.

However, I felt the story of the film was weak. While it mostly is a standard disaster film, the big quake itself happens about half-way through the film. The first hour or so plays out like a bad soap opera and even after all the characters are introduced, it is difficult to really care about any of them and leaves you wondering when the action is going to start. Some of the characters are rather stupidly written and the acting in some parts is poor.

This movie was a mixed bag for me. This is surely a must-see for anyone that is a fan of disaster films, especially those from the 1970s.",1392249600,2,1345,4.642857142857143

Both Los Angeles and San Francisco are built close to the San Andreas Fault in California that has given very strong earthquakes in the past, the largest of which was the San Francisco earthquake of 1905, measuring about 8.5 on the Richter scale. It talks about pre-shocks and after-shocks, which are normal in any big earthquake.
Now, where do things go wrong? It mentions pre-shocks measuring about 3.5 on the Richter scale and the film shows you the kind of shake you normally get from a scale 6 and above. Then, when the big one comes, the exaggeration of the portrayed movement is amazing, fit for something more than 9.5 on the Richter scale, nowhere near the 7.8 mentioned in the film.
Geological phenomena apart, the film has a very thin story line, depicting personal tragedies within the events. Well known actors take part, who could have acted much better if directed properly by the films director.
As to the sound effects, no matter how good your sound system is, you miss the effect experienced in the theatre, at the time this film was released. The image quality of the sound quality of this blu-ray are not a great improvement on the old DVD.

I waited for what seemed like forever for Universal to release Earthquake.  I already knew that they weren't putting any effort into it, such as special features or the Made-for-TV extra long scenes...but I thought AT LEAST the picture would be good...and that's all that should matter. Well, I've put this one in and tried to watch this 3-4 times and can't get through it.  Universal really botched this release.  I saw this movie 4 times in the theater and again 2 years ago at the Egyptian theater in Hollywood...and it's NEVER looked like this. Universal has taken it upon itself to add artificial sharpening to this blu ray and the effect is HORRIBLE...the entire film looks like it's swarming with misquitos...and for all of you too young to have seen this in the theater, I can guarantee you this is NOT how this film is supposed to look.  I have no idea what blu ray the other reviewers on this site were looking at, but I can't believe they thought this looked good...every scene that shows a sky looks terrible...as if the film is caught in a sandstorm...By far one of the worst blu rays in my collection...SO BAD, that I'm going to throw this copy away (thank God I got it cheap) and stick with the DVD...which doesn't look good either, but still looks better than the blu ray.  It's as if some guy in the mastering dept. at Universal just ran this through and didn't even do a quality check on it...MY ADVICE, DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS MESS! And Universal wonders why people don't buy older catolog titles, well here is the reason folks. A complete waste of money for a film I totally couldn't wait to own.

222365,4,6300181510,"The picture and sound remaster of this '70s disaster classic is outstanding.  Deep blacks, rich colors.  This transfer was clearly struck from a first-generation print.  I don't even remember the movie looking this good in cinemas!  Red carpet treatment all the way.  Stacks right up there with Fox's blu-rays of The Poseidon Adventure and The Towering Inferno, the other duet in the '70s disaster trio, which also look and sound majestic.

There are two English soundtracks to enjoy the earthquake's rumble in, 5.1 DTS-HD and 2.0 DTS-HD ""sensurround"" (the '70s pre-Dolby Stereo sound process, which added a LFE bass track to the original mono sound track and woofers placed all over the theater to really shake one's bones).  I recommend the 5.1 track (English 1, the default), as the bass really rocks, and there is some nice stereo spread in John Williams' music score and stereo plus surround in some of the sound-FX.

Some of the visual FX (the models and miniatures, particularly a shot of a truck filled with cows driving off a collapsing L.A. freeway bridge) still look quite good and hold up quite well even today, whereas others (the matte paintings and rear-screen process backgrounds) clearly look fake and show their age.  Overall, though, you'll feel like you're in a real earthquake in this show.

I subtracted one star because there are no special features (screenplay development, casting and special-FX retrospectives would've been cool), nada, zip, on this release, but, considering the bargain basement price, one can't complain too much.  Guess the phenomenal success of Spielberg's Jaws eclipsed all of Universal's other efforts in the '70s, including Earthquake, so Universal lavished the royal treatment on that shark-buster, and gave us a bare-bones release of Earthquake.

Oh, well.  Fire up the subwoofer.  Clint Eastwood, lathered in shaving cream, shooting henchmen from his barber's chair in the movie within this movie that is playing in the movie theater, High Plains Drifter, followed by...RUMBLE!!!",1371600000,5,2032,5.231481481481482
222366,5,6300181510,"Earthquake has always been one of my favorite films. I saw it the first week it was released in 1974 in Sensurround. The plot was not all that strong but the special effects at the time were ground breaking. It won four Academy Awards: Sound, Visual Effects and two technical awards (Class II and III).

It has an all star cast: Charlton Heston, Ava Gardner, Victoria Principal (pre Dallas), Lorne Greene, Richard Roundtree, George Kennedy, Genevieve Bujold, Lloyd Nolan, Marjoe Gortner and Barry Sullivan. Much has been made over the years about the seven year age difference between Lorne Greene and Ava Gardner (she plays his daughter). Not the best casting but I love Gardner in this.

There have been several vhs, dvd editions. Each was better than the previous one but this blu ray gets it right. It looks just as good or even better than when I saw it first run. It is remastered in high definition and includes the original Sensurround audio. It was like watching it for the first time.

My only complaint, as in the other editions are the lack of any special features. Not even the trailer. Also when this movie was first shown it television it was padded with extra footage. I was not impressed with any of that and none of the top billed actors are featured, but it would have been nice for it to have been included here.",1370736000,10,1332,4.588235294117647

Would have been nice to have waited for the 40th Anniversary Edition with plenty of special features and deleted scenes. The scenes added to the TV version is out there somewhere. I would have liked to see those tacked on for our enjoyment (pretty cool scene when the airplane is trying to land and the runway is splitting open. Best bet: get back up in the air!). The video looks to have been tampered with. Seems Universal has turned up the digital noise reduction because this film looks more like video (and some scenes look flat). Have not known Universal for doing tinkering in this way...that's why I love their blu rays. It is not evident throughout, just in the day light scenes. Even the gimmick of tricking us into believing this disc is encoded with ""Sensurround"" is laughable. The Low Frequency Effect does not simulate Sensurround in any way. Universal should have put more time and money into producing a Special Edition of this classic. Not even the cheesy trailer is included. What a wasted opportunity. Thanks for the re-hash Universal.

222369,3,6300181510,"My first viewing of 'Earthquake' was the padded version when it debuted on NBC in 1976. It's nice to see the straight theatrical version. But I have to agree with other reviewers (in particular, W. Budris and 'Tall Paul') that Universal Studios should absolutely be called to task for this disappointing, no-frills version of a classic film.

As for the movie, it does a credible job of cashing in on the disaster film genre which was beginning to wane by the mid-70's. After 'Airport', 'The Towering Inferno' and 'The Poseidon Adventure', the public had its fill of star-studded disaster flicks. Still, Universal managed to put an exclamation point on a unique time in cinema history. As lead character Stewart Graff, Charlton Heston...an actor I've always admired...never really gets a chance to flex his acting muscles. You won't see the emotional soul-searching and angst we became accustomed to in 'Ben-Hur' and 'The Ten Commandments'. Here, he's too busy 'reacting'. To his job. To neurotic, jealous wife Ava Gardner. To mistress Genevieve Bujold. Well, you get the idea. If anyone deserved star billing, it was George Kennedy, as a cop who's already having a bad day. The earthquake just makes it worse. Kennedy absolutely shines in his role, in the same way he did in 'Cool Hand Luke'. As with Heston, Kennedy never gets to fully spread his wings, thanks to all the various subplots and other characters who have to get their face time as well. It was a blast to see Victoria Principal in one of her few pre-'Dallas' roles, as well as the late Walter Matthau (as a colorful drunk) appearing under the alias ""Walter Matuschanskayasky""..say that fast 3 times! Former preacher Marjoe Gortner was no Richard Burton when it came to acting, but he had a quirky knack for playing a character that was just icky enough that you'd remember him long after the film was over. A good example was his part here as a National Guardsman who goes off the deep end and attempts an awkward rape of Victoria's character. Gortner, to this day, still has my envy for getting to roll around with a very naked Linda Carter (TV's Wonder Woman) in 'Bobby Jo and the Outlaw'.

As for special effects, most of them still hold up pretty well. Some of them were quite cheesy, even by 70's standards. The well-known elevator scene, with its hokey, animated 'blood' spattered on the screen, and the cattle truck, after it dives off a freeway ramp and the 'cows' stay in place even when the truck impacts with the ground comes to mind. But this was in the days before CGI and some tech nerd could do a better job with a laptop PC and a software program.

Indeed, the biggest issue is the way in which Universal handled this release. When it debuted in 1974, 'Earthquake' became the 4th highest grossing film of the year, and was nominated for 4 Academy Awards, eventually winning two. And yet, for this important film, we get a bare-bones DVD that doesn't even have scene selection or audio options (other than English or Spanish). Not even the theatrical trailers were included. Shame on you, Universal, shame on you!",1370217600,5,3094,4.757914338919925
222370,4,6300181510,"These were the nicknames for ""Earthquake"" and ""The Towering Inferno"" during the fall of 1974 when these films were released.
Yah...what they could do today with all the CGI stuff, but I'll still take ""Earthquake"".
The Sensurround gimmick was fun and the special effects and matte paintings by Albert Whitlock still hold up.
I was at Universal studios after the filming and part of the tour was the ""making of"".
They had to dig giant holes in the soundstage to accommodate the fake skyscraper sets where people are flying out of the side of the building. Got to see raw footage of the stunt people flying into giant airbags etc.
The part with the flood where Roundtree comes flying down a street with water behind him used to be part of the back lot tour.
I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Whitlock at a seminar where he explained a lot of the tricks.
Most of the tops of the buildings on the back lot were matted in.
If you slow the picture down you can see the amazing optical work during the big one. Debris falling, insulation, broken glass. My only fault with film is when the chick is screaming ""Mother"" during the big one, you can tell Mommy already had broken glass in her face before it falls. Look quick you guys.
At the end of the film you see fires at different points of the scene. Mr. Whitlock did this by setting blow torches off at different parts of a dark soundstage and then incorporating it into the film.
If you want to see the late Mr. Whitlock in ""person"" check out ""High Anxiety"".
He played Madeline Kahn's father and also did the matte work for this Mel Brooks film.
He also did the matte work for ""The Hindenburg"" the following year which he won his second consecutive Oscar for special effects along with ""Earthquake"" the year before.
He also did matte work for Hitchcock during the early years in the sixties starting with ""The Birds"" and into the seventies up to ""Family Plot"". He was a master painter.
Hope this was helpful to all of the ""fifty some things"" who remember the disaster craze with fond memories.

P.S Chuck and Ava really did hate each other in real life. Guess that's why their scenes seem real.

And while the picture is fine, the audio is not.  The volume level of the center (dialogue) channel is very low in the so-called 5.1 version (I didn't even bother to listen to the so-called 3.1 Sensurround track).  I really had to crank up the level on my receiver way higher than normal.  The low frequency effects which were there weren't at all impressive and I didn't hear any surround at all.  Of course, this movie was made before the days of Dolby stereo in theatres.  Also, I didn't remember that this was such a bad movie.  The cast seemed to almost limp thru their parts, the plot was a bore and even the earthquake effects weren't all that exciting, although I kept hoping that Ava Gardner would be hit by a giant falling slab of concrete.  Even Chuck Heston was off his mark.

It's interesting how they can pass any law that crosses their minds about what the users can do and not do with a film but they have no rules.

222407,3,6300181510,"Having lived through the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 in Santa Cruz, I was curious to see how this one would be portrayed. Perhaps in 1974, this was pretty realistic, but the damage seems extreme. Of course one of the characters, Stuart Graff (Charlton Heston) was an architect who expressed shame for having built skyscrapers that were too tall for the earthquake risk, but I still think they were exaggerated. I'd like to know what an expert would say.

In the tags, I'm torn between listing all the stars and just calling it an all-star cast. In addition to Charlton Heston, Ava Gardner plays Remi Graff, his wife and a 14 karat bitch. George Kennedy plays a cop named Slade, who goes from being suspended to being a hero. Lorne Greene plays Seth Royce, Graff's father-in-law, head of the highly successful architectural firm that designed many of the buildings that are clearly not earthquake safe, including his own office building. Genevieve Bujold plays Denise, a young actress and the widow of one of Graff's men who died in the field, and eventually Graff's mistress. Marjoe Gortner plays a grocery clerk named Jody who is called up to the National Guard for the emergency, but has an agenda of his own. Lloyd Nolan plays Dr. Vance, who handles triage in the emergency medical center where Denise's son is taken after he is injured.

Other interesting characters are not played by anyone I recognize as famous. There's a black motorcycle stunt rider, his Italian manager, and the manager's sister. They tie into several other characters, including Jody the grocery clerk, Denise and her son, and also Officer Slade. Seth's secretary is named Barbara, and knows both Remi Graff (who is, after all, Seth's daughter as well as Graff's wife) and Denise. In fact, Denise used the excuse of coming to visit Barbara the day she finally seduced Stuart.

It's a pretty interesting film, all in all, including the drama over whether the dam would break and what would happen when it did, but I can't help coming back to the idea that either the quake was much more than the 7 Richter scale which was originally mentioned, or the damage was unrealistic for the sake of drama.

The story begins at a large city, we see the wide highways of Los Angeles. One man exercises in the morning, and will skip breakfast. [Symbolism?] His wife has an attack. Then there is a jolt from an earthquake! Elsewhere a police car chases a speeding sports car. [There is a comic scene] A government agency checks its seismographs, one man predicts they will get a big earthquake. Out in the country restless sheep foretell a tremor. This is not a good time to be in a big hole in the ground. A young lady gets credit at a small grocery store. Should people be warned of an impending earthquake? Yes. [Some of the outfits and characters seem unintentionally funny.] There are many subplots to provide for varied interests. The Governor calls out the National Guard. Will a new building exceed earthquake standards?

We see the conflicts in people's lives. Dogs bark, the animals are restless. The big tremor sharkes up things. A highway bridge collapses! A house collapses and falls down the hill. Other buildings collapse! People rush to get on elevators! [A death trap?] People are hurt by falling debris. Water pipes fracture and leak. People evacuate tall buildings. Some fall from great heights. [Are those tube receivers?] Can they release water from the dam to relieve pressure? Smoke enters buildings, there is a fire. Fallen electrical wires create danger. It's the greatest national disaster in history. Looters are arrested. People take refuge in basement parking garages. People are told to leave for high ground in case of a dam collapse. Some looters are shot! A car is commandeered for use in moving people. Another tremor causes more damage. People are trapped in basements when the building partly collapses.

Was building forty story skyscrapers a mistake? [Building codes are controlled by politicians who answer to the local ruling class, usually the big landowners.] One soldier exceeds his authority. The Hollywood reservoir dam springs small leaks! People below ground must be evacuated. Can they break through concrete to save them? The reservoir dam breaks to flood the city. Can those people be rescued in time? The flood sweeps away people to their doom. The survivors reach the surface. ""This used to be a hell of a town.""

Usually a happy ending is needed for commercial success. I don't know how successful this complex movie was in 1974. Back then all we had to worry about was the price and availability of gasoline, and a very crooked national politician. Since then there were California earthquakes in 1989 and 1994. Some parts remind me of the horrible destruction of September 2001 in Manhattan. Tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, and blizzards are recurring problems. In 1975 ""Jaws"" was a very successful horror film. Bad economic times usually produce horror movies (as in the 1930s).

222425,4,6300181510,"Oh yeah, it's a clunky dialogue film with every 70s cliche' in the book but it's a mess of fun. No plot desciption necessary here. The seventies idea was to establish every charactor with enough pathos so that the audience would become frenetic as to who should live or painfully die. Earthquake gets there, but to a somewhat lesser degree than other disaster flicks of noteriety.
  So, Ava Gardner looks as bad as her charactor is inside, that works. Good old Charlton Heston is tailor made(no pun intended)as the heroic young as* grabber of Ms. Boujold. Seventies cinematic taboo well placed. For the era, the twisted manglings of LA(baby)look passable enough to hold the film. George Kennedy's wild eyed cop is right on target as we all remember his deserved stare-down of Victoria Principles ti*s. I'm waiting for the blu ray to really judge the famous sensorround that loses punch on a standard DVD. It's all a bit soapy at times but a fun scene is just around the corner- maybe cool Miles Quade's play on Evil Knieval...or rooting for the boring rookie seismologist who knows more than the department combined. And ah yes-my then ten year old theatre going mind still has the trigger-happy weekend warrior emblazoned in it. What red blooded boy didn't want to save Ms. Principle?
  Some nice retro cameoes if you really dig into the movie. The ending is thoughtful. I'll always remember Hestons big decision in the sewer pipe. He went for the hard choice! The film screams a blu ray release which I know is on the horizon- it's been a long time coming for this fan. Earthquake is a heavy dose of unintended nostalgia that should rub you right if you understand the world of Hollywood at that time (and embrace it).

222427,5,6300181510,"I first saw this movie at a Drive-In eons ago, when it first came out.  Loved it then, love it now, it isn't complicated, it's a disaster!  And while this wasn't the one that started my great fondness for the genre, it still ranks high as one of those I love to watch repeatedly.  Every scene is a favorite so I can't even highlight a moment that's above all the rest.  It's near perfection...all right, there were those two bumps in the road: Marjoe Gortner & Ava Gardner, okay three, add that weird comic relief by Walter Matuschanskayasky (Matthau).  Still don't understand what Walter was doing in this movie but whatever.  There was no excuse in hiring retired evangelist Gortner, he was a celebrity of sorts at the time, obviously couldn't act.  As for Ava Gardner playing poor Lorne Greene's ""DAUGHER"" (his mother, I would have believed), she certainly milked every one of her scenes for all the melodrama they were worth.  And the way she played them, they weren't worth much.
The first draft of the screenplay was written by Mario Puzo.  John Williams did the score.  The movie actually won an Oscar...for sound.  I still don't understand why the critics hated it.  How can you hate a movie where a guy drowns in an elevator!?!?!?!?

Well I ultimately ended up living in two states that frequently get earthquakes (Alaska and California) and this movie came to mind several times whenever we would have a shaker!  Even though there are corny parts to this movie, there are the great heroes (Charlton Heston, George Kennedy) and other fine actors and actresses (Ava Gardner, Lorne Green among some) who make this movie a good watch.  There's also a very young Victoria Principal in this movie.  The story line is pretty good, and special effects not bad for the time.  Nothing compared to what they could do today, but sometimes I prefer the movies with those ""older"" special effects techniques.  A ""must-have"" movie to add to  your ""disaster"" collection.",1300665600,2,868,4.910958904109589
222429,2,6300181510,"""Earthquake"" is more than just a disaster movie - it's a disaster of a movie!  I remember seeing it in the theatre when it first came out in 1974.  I was barely in my teens, but even at that age I thought that this over-baked, overlong saga of ""The Big One"" hitting Los Angeles was simply awful in terms of plot, dialogue, casting, and special effects.  The only thing that impressed me at the time was Sensurround, the innovative Special Sound Effect that approximated the rumbling of shifting earth and was awarded an Oscar.

Cut to almost 40 years later.  I find a copy of the DVD in a bargain bin for a couple of dollars, and begin to wonder, ""Was it really as bad as I thought?"" Well, in a word, yes!  In fact, ""Earthquake"" surely qualifies as one of the worst unintentionally funny movies in Hollywood history.  Consider the casting of Lorne Greene and Ava Gardner - he plays her father despite the fact that she is clearly close to his own age!  (He was born in 1915, she in 1922.)  As if this isn't bad enough, they - along with the rest of the cast - are given abominable material to work with.  Miss Gardner, for example, plays a one-dimensional shrew with no redeeming qualities whatsoever; she cusses and fusses in every scene she's in.  No one else in the all-star cast is given material that's any better; every character is strictly a cardboard stereotype, including those played by Charlton Heston (the principled, steel-spined hero), George Kennedy (the tough, can-do police officer), Genevieve Bujold (the perky young love interest), Marjoe Gortner (the psychotic National Guardsman), or even the unbilled Walter Matthau (the drunk who doesn't notice the walls falling in around him).

One might think that the special effects would makeup for any inadequacies in the script and performances, but one would be wrong!  See if you can spot the hilariously awful shot in which an entire brick wall (obviously made out of Styrofoam or some other lightweight material) crashes down in one piece, without the mortar or bricks breaking apart on impact.  (The editor cuts away quickly, but not quickly enough.)  It goes without saying that the effects in ""Earthquake"" are rudimentary compared to the digital effects we have in this day and age, but in fact, even movies made 40 years *before* ""Earthquake"" had more believable scenes of destruction (I'm thinking of the earthquake in the 1936 MGM film ""San Francisco"" in particular).

There's really not much in this movie to recommend; today, even the once revolutionary Sensurround effects are mundane.  It may be worth a single viewing if your curiosity gets the best of you, but consider a rental rather than a purchase.  Once is definitely enough.",1295654400,,2711,4.818574514038877

222441,1,6300181510,"Fact: Most of the disaster films of the 1970s were god-awful abominations of cinema. Earthquake, Airport, The Swarm etc. The lone exception probably being The Towering Inferno, and that's mostly by the good graces of Paul Newman and the great Steve McQueen. How bad is Earthquake? The directing is an absolute embarrassment, the writing is horrid, which is sad considering it was co-written by The Godfather book/movie writer Mario Puzo, the special effects were laughable even for the time period, and most of the actors/characterization in this movie is dead and/or dying, the lone exception being Ben Cartwright from Bonanza because let's face it, he's Ben Cartwright from Bonanza. Also, Walter Matthau is in here for absolutely no reason at all.

Charlton Heston plays a businessman who is having an affair with a young mother, while having marital troubles with the nagging Ava Gardner. Ava Gardner is also the daughter of Lorne Greene, aka Ben Cartwright, even though they clearly look the same way (in actuality Ava is 7 years younger than Greene). George Kennedy plays a cop that picked the bad day to be on the job. Richard Roundtree is a motorcyclist who thinks he's a lot better than he clearly is, and then there's Marjoe Gortner. Everybody that I asked who remembered Earthquake all said the same thing, they remembered Marjoe Gortner and how he ruined the movie. It's easy to see why they'd say it. Gortner plays a grocer who can only be described as an arrest away from officially being considered a pedophile and/or sexual predator, and he has pin-ups of male body builders on his wall, giving the assumption to his roommates at least that he is gay, to which they proceed to call him offensive slang and throw things at him. He also happens to be a National Guard Sargent, so when he's called to patrol the city during the Earthquake, he snaps, kills people, and comes close to raping a girl. I don't know exactly what the purpose of this character was supposed to be, since he really isn't consequential to any of the proceedings, the character comes off as offensive in every possible way. Did I also mention that the way all these actors portray their characters can be best described as wooden?

I could go on riffs on how the director was incompetent to say the least, the ending was needless and perplexingly bad to say the least, but in the end, Earthquake is just a bad movie on many different levels, for two hours, without any redeemable qualities. Nobody really liked it back then, and the only reason it was popular was because it came out in the absolute height of the 1970s disaster movie era, where it came out in the same year as The Towering Inferno and Airport 1975. Today, Earthquake has aged like sour milk left in a hot shed for 30 years. Nobody really liked it back then, and today it's just an utter embarrassment of filmmaking for all involved. In fact, the only thing good that ever came out of this movie was a Universal Studios ride, and even that is somewhat debatable.",1279411200,,3014,4.706439393939394

(USA - 1974)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)
Theatrical soundtrack: 6-track stereo (Sensurround encoding)

Several disparate characters are drawn together in the aftermath of an earthquake which devastates Los Angeles.

Soapy addition to the 1970's disaster cycle, featuring an all-star cast going through the dreary motions (who CARES if Charlton Heston is threatening to leave wife Ava Gardner for younger woman Genevive Bujold?) until their problems are resolved - one way or another - by an earth-shattering catastrophe. The earthquake itself is impressive in some places (collapsing miniatures, burning buildings, expansive matte paintings, etc.) and dreadful in others ('shaky-cam' inserts, animated 'blood splatter', optical distortions which LOOK like optical distortions, etc.), though some moviegoers were lucky enough to view the film theatrically in Sensurround, an ultra-deep bass enhancement which caused structural damage in a number of theaters!

Directed by industry veteran Mark Robson (BEDLAM, ISLE OF THE DEAD) and produced by Universal at a time when most of their output looked like big screen TV features, the movie was intended to give THE TOWERING INFERNO (1974) a run for its money and came off looking pretty ropey in comparison, though it DOES have a strong cast (including George Kennedy, giving the film's best performance as a disillusioned cop whose faith is restored in the aftermath of the quake). The moralistic ending is particularly hard to swallow.",1256688000,2,1501,5.623893805309734
222447,5,6300181510,"This is one of the most memorable movies of the 70's, it's got everything: action, drama, infidelity, fire, floods and the ""EARTHQUAKE"".  When I saw this movie back on 1974 I did not notice some of the cheesy visual effects I notice now.  Still that does not diminish the quality and the impact that ""Earthquake"" leaves in you.  The plot, on the part of the drama has some holes but if you focus on the earthquake and the trauma it leaves on the survivors, the movie won't disappoint you.  However the DVD release has some disappointments, the SENSURROUND is missing, it is not the same shocking effect I remember from the days I was watching EARTHQUAKE in the theathers.  I recall feeling like the theather was falling apart over me while watching this movie, I really felt the deep vibration like it was a real earthquake.  It is the SOUND effect what made EARTHQUAKE a huge box office success and an OSCAR WINNER for Best Sound.  EARTHQUAKE also won the OSCAR of Special Achievement Award for Visual Effect.  On the other side, I don't really care much about the inclusion of the new footage that casts Debralee Scott and Sam Chew on an airplane trying to land during the earthquake, this footage was recorded 2 years later and was added to the theatrical release in order to be shown on television.  What really disappointed me is that the 30 minutes of the original footage that were actually chopped from the original theatrical release are not included here as an UNCUT or EXTENDED version of the movie or they could at least have them included in a DELETED SCENES additional feature.  All and all this is one of the most memorable and succesful movies of the 70's because of its amazing SENSURROUND sound and visual effects, and the amazing cast.

222449,3,6300181510,"Earthquake was 1974's other big disaster movie, but despite the big budget and the `all-star' cast it's dated much worse than The Towering Inferno. Part of the problem is the soap operatics in the foreground, with Charlton Heston torn between neurotic wife Ava Gardner and his young mistress Genevieve Bujold taking centre-stage among various minor daytime soap subplots courtesy of writer Mario Puzo. Rather than making you care about the fate of the characters, they just leave you impatient for the quake to finally hit LA, but once it does there's not much focus to the destruction: whereas the S.S. Poseidon and the Glass Tower confined their characters in one perilous structure to add a sense of claustrophobia and tension, here the cast are spread all across the city when the aftershocks that cause the real damage and start depleting the cast arrive. This wouldn't be too much of a problem if the film had any real sense of scale to it, but despite the all-star cast and the big budget, it has the feel of a backlot movie rather than being shot on location. The film has the flat 70s TV-movie version lighting and photography that was a feature of most 70s Universal films, which just adds an extra helping of cheese to the proceedings. Even John Williams' score feels at times like a lounge music variation on his work on The Towering Inferno, as if the whole film was put together with whatever was lying around the studio. The result is watchable enough if you're in an undemanding mood, but resolutely unmemorable.

Of the supporting cast, George Kennedy's cop fares best while Lloyd Nolan comes off worst, all but fluffing his lines as if he'd only been given the script seconds before the camera started rolling. Of the remainder - Lorne Greene, Richard Roundtree, Marjoe Gortner, Victoria Principal - only Walter Matthau's drunk (billed as Walter Matuschanskwyaski) makes much impression in a running gag that sees him drift through the film unperturbed by the chaos. The DVD can't replicate the Senssurround effect that made the cinema seats rumble on its original release, but  it could at least have  made some  effort - this is one of  Universal's budget titles  that  doesn't  even  bother  with  a menu,  let alone any extras (even the UK DVD includes a trailer).

222470,3,6300181510,"While the picture is beautiful, the new DVD of ""Earthquake"" completely misses the boat on the Sensurround track and special features. First of all, the so-called ""3.1"" Sensurround track is nothing but the same, mono, audio fed to the 3 front channels with the 25/35 Hz control tones on the .1 LFE channel - no rumble is there at all. Nothing of the sort was ever heard in theaters, so I don't know why Universal bothered. It's obvious that the Universal tech's in charge of the DVD audio transfer didn't know that the control tones are NOT the earthquake rumble and are NOT meant to be heard! The 5.1-channel remix is problimatical too.  Earthquake was the first feature to use the Sensurround Special Effects System (US Patent #3, 973,839). Because, at the time, audio in theaters and on film was in such a primitive state, MCA/Universal engineers designed a sound system to run along side the theaters existing system. Two control tones, at 25 and 35 Hz, were recorded either on the main soundtrack (for optical prints) or, with stereo Magnetic prints, on the redundant optical soundtrack. Their presence and volume controlled the turning on and off of a low-frequency noise (rumble) generator to create the 'earthquake' effects - they also controlled the addition of the ""Center Front"" channel (or the composite optical) into the Sensurround channel to create ""surround"" effects. When desired, the two tones could also increase the volume of ALL the speakers in the theater by a desired amount.  While the 4-track magnetic soundtrack had a standard ""effects/surround"" soundtrack (complete with 12kHz CinemaScope switching tone), in Sensurround equipped theaters, the surround mag track was disconnected and not used at all... instead, the Center Front mag channel was connected into the Sensurround channel to create the 'surround' effects when needed. For non-Sensurround installations that used the Magnetic soundtrack, the 4-track mag had the standard surround soundtrack available. Universal's engineers in charge of the new DVD soundtrack remix do not seem to have known this - none of the sounds from the Center Front channel are used at all in the surround channels, nor is any of the Sensurround rumble taken to the back channels as it should be.  In addition to the deep rumble, Sensurround was intended to ""Surround and engulf you"", which the new 5.1 track does NOT do! The composite mono optical prints, or the mag stereo prints, contained all the information the mixers needed, to know when to direct the sounds, and by how much, from the Center Front into the back channels. They only had to listen to and measure the amounts of 25 and 35 Hz tones! Heck, the old MCA DiscoVision laser videodisc release has the control tones present that we can hear, so anyone could have figured it out!  Also, it does not appear that Universal used a Sensurround rumble generator - the bass is nowhere near deep enough - I've measured it and it cuts off around 25 Hz! That's a whole octave higher than it should be! The cut-off frequency that was designed for Sensurround was 16Hz. The bass should be played at a level of 110-120db at those frequencies! To replicate the Sensurround soundtrack on DVD, here's what should have been done:

The ""main"" channels should have been recorded at a much lower level than usual onto the DVD master. The Sensurround rumble should have been recorded at, or as near as possible, to 0db as they could. This would have allowed them to duplicate Sensurround in the home. It would have required the home viewer to raise their main volume control much higher than usual to hear the soundtrack, thus, when the rumble came along, it would be at it's correct, high, level - and the extra headroom could have been used to raise the level of the main soundtrack during the quake as the original presentation called for. The Center Front should have been mixed into the surrounds as required and the original mag Surround track used too.  For viewers who don't have the ability to play the Sensurround track at such high levels, the original 4-track master, without Sensurround, should have been supplied at standard volume as an alternate track. The original mono Sensurround-compatible shouldtrack should have been supplied too as a 1.0 Dolby Digital track.

Contrary to what others claim, Earthquake was the ONLY Stereophonic Sensurround release (Zoot Suit doesn't count) - after Earthquake, Sensurround was modified to place all the effects on an optical mono track with dbx Type-II noise reduction. ALL of the other ""Sensurround"" DVD releases from Universal get the Sensurround track wrong too - Midway, Battlestar, Rollercoaster - all WRONG! The Sensurround, because of the control tones, would pan from the front to the back of the theater, as required - none of the DVD's duplicate this - it gave them a 'surround-type' soundtrack capability from a standard mono-optical print. Hopefully, future HD-DVD relases will get this right - if Universal would only ask me about it! I have extensive documentation on the Sensurround system and am probably the foremost authority on it in the world.

The basic fidelity and seperation of the 3 front channels is quite good, as is the high-frequency response. Unlike other magnetic stereo films of the era, Earthquake was mixed with mono, meaning Center Front-only, dialogue - other films of the time panned the dialogue across each channel to follow the speaker. The DVD replicates this nicely, although I hate mono dialogue.

The image of ""Earthquake"" has a bit too much edge enhancement, but is otherwise OK. Sadly, there are NO special features at all, which is a pitty, as there was a wealth of material produced for Earthquake.  MCA Universal made a ""Sensurround Product Demo Reel"" to show theater owners how the system worked and why they should install it in their theater - there were film demo reels to show the total image+sound effect - there were Sensurround encoded trailers - there was deleted footage - the LAX restraunt was actually modeled and filmed collapsing, but the footage wasn't used in the film - in addition, around 10 mintues of footage were deleted shortly before the films release - all of this should have been included on the disc along with photos of the incredible Sensurround horns.

BTW, in the Mid-1970's, MCA/Universal was attempting to sell Sensurround as a new, high-fidelity, film sound system - Dolby Stereo had just become available, and there was a general industry-wide interest in upgrading theater sound. MCA positioned Sensurround as a large increase in fidelity with special effects, all from a single, compatible, mono optical soundtrack. When the dbx Type-II noise reduction was added, the specifications of Sensurround were quite impressive:

Dynamic Range-90db
SN Ratio-80db
Frequency Response-16Hz to 16,000 kHz.

All these specs out-did Dolby Stereo at the time.  SENSURROUND+PLUS, used on Zoot Suit, was merely the use of dbx Noise Reduction, WITHOUT the rumble, on a 4-track mag stereo soundtrack.

Hopefully, Universal will get it right on the HD-DVD's of the Sensurround films.",1181433600,85,7109,5.02803738317757

222483,4,6300181510,"As most people know by now, most disaster films, especially those that were so spectacularly popular at the box office in the 1970s, are for the most part soap operas or melodramas in which an all-star cast must somehow fight for survival after some outrageous cataclysm, be it natural or man-made.

EARTHQUAKE, released near the end of 1974, isn't any different.  There is plenty of melodrama to be had, and a lot of soap opera theatrics to be found, not to mention a lot of dated dialogue and hair styles to go along with all that.  In short, it has everything that critics learned to despise about the entire disaster movie genre.

And yet, for those of us living in Southern California, where this film is set, earthquakes and the fear of them are a basic fact of life.  And those are the kinds of fears that this 1974 box office smash taps into.  Admittedly it's a tough job to ignore the overblown theatrics between Charlton Heston and Ava Gardner, or Marjoe Gortner's psychotic National Guard character.  But beyond that, the very likelihood of Los Angeles being hit with a cataclysmic quake, as happens here via Oscar-winning special effects work by Albert Whitlock, Frank Brendel, and Glen Robinson (which, though perhaps dated by today's standards, still work well under the circumstances) and Universal's wall-shaking Sensurround system, is a bit too frightening to sweep under the rug without a second thought.  As a result, soap opera theatrics aside, EARTHQUAKE qualifies as a science fiction film much as it does a disaster pic.

There isn't a whole lot that this cast, which includes good people like George Kennedy, Genevieve Bujold, Barry Sullivan, Donald Moffat, and Kip Niven can really do with the overcooked dialogue of the George Fox/Mario Puzo screenplay; and director Mark Robson is also somewhat hog-tied as well.  But when the Big One hits, the City of Angels is virtually annihilated from underneath, and the cast must find its way out of the horrible rubble, this is where EARTHQUAKE works.

So what we have is an undeniably flawed ""relic"" of its time in terms of dialogue, acting, and direction, but a cautionary warning of what can happen to L.A. if Mother Nature decides to roll a 7.0 or higher on the Richter scale.",1167523200,3,2248,4.8433420365535245

222488,2,6300181510,"From aircraft crashes to volcanic erruptions, disaster movies have been popular since the days of silent film--but they were particularly so in 1970s, when films like THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE and THE TOWERING INFERNO broke box office records right and left.  And then there was EARTHQUAKE, a 1974 release that tried to ride the tide of popularity and pretty much went bust.

The basic problem with EARTHQUAKE is the plot.  There isn't any.  Oh, sure, there's some stuff about Charleton Heston, who is cheating on shrewish wife Ava Gardner with youthful and very wimpy Genevieve Bujold, not to mention sundry subplots (the tough but honest cop, the stunt cyclist, and so on), but the cast is indifferent at best, the dialogue is tiresome, and it is ultimately just a very lame and very silly build up to the disaster itself.

EARTHQUAKE's big trick was a gimmicky thing that might have been dreamed up by schlock-master William Castle: ""Sensurround.""  It was essentially a bass-heavy sound system that blasted out sub-bass frequencies serious enough to make the audience shake, rattle, and roll.  Unfortunately, the system actually proved a little too successful for it's own good, causing bits of the ceiling to flake off upon unsuspecting audiences in older cinemas, and after one or two unsavory incidents a great many theatres refused to install it.

Shorn of Sensurround, EARTHQUAKE is left with a very mixed back of special effects that range from the spectacular to the ludicrously bad.  In any case, it is all too little and too late, and the best thing that can be said for it is that all the characters you least like get popped before it comes to an end.  The DVD release offers a sharp, clear print, but there are no extras of any kind...  And as for the famed Sensurround, well, you're free to do whatever you want with your speaker system as long as you don't annoy the neighbors, and good luck to you.

222489,3,6300181510,"Like another reviewer stated, the new digital transfer of ""Earthquake"" is simply amazing.  Clearly, Universal stuck a new print from a new negative, which does not have all the flaws  (and notable ""emulsion scratch"" during a certain quake scene) that were present in the 1998 Goodtimes release.  The results are a much more vivid picture, with nice color saturation.  The sound has been completely remixed in Dolby Surround 5.1, and features the legendary original ""Sensurround"" track as an option that will shake your house if you have the proper, high-power sound system (it just sounds like distorted bottom end audio if you don't).  If you crank it, it's pretty impressive.  The 5.1 is separated nicely, revealing many sound effects not heard in the prior Goodtimes release -- this 5.1 Surround does the Academy Award-winning sound engineers of the original film proud!

If one was interested in just seeing the film by itself -- with fantastic picture and sound -- then, this disc will be fine for you.

If you're looking for something along the lines of Fox's very well done ""Sepcial Edition"" DVDs of ""The Towering Inferno"" and ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" you will be sorely surprised and disappointed.  Universal Home Video colossally screwed up on the presentation of ""Earthquake"" on this DVD.  No extras.  No liner notes.  No trailers.  No still pictures.  Not even chapter menus!  Really, how difficult is it to make a chapter menu?  Apparently, it was too difficult or time consuming for Universal to add the extras -- what makes this more frustrating is, this type of information for the DVD is out there, and easy to get:  there is a fan web site dedicated to the film that has a ton of information.  The lack of attention by Universal is baffling, since ""Earthquake"" is a film that was a huge hit for the studio in 1974.  In light of the release next to the Fox ""Special Editions"" of their disaster films, Universal should be ashamed of this abortion of a DVD.

Universal has treated this film like a throwaway, and if they took that attitude, they should have left the bad-print Good Times issue stand.  Even the Region 2 UK version is better than this.  It's in 5.1 and at least gives you one trailer!

The upgrades to this edition of EQ include a 3.1 Sensurround track, besides a 5.1 track, plus 2.0 Spanish track.  You set your language and play the film.  There isn't even a Select The Scenes menu.  There are more chapter markers than the previous issue, but some are in weird places.  The print of the film is fabulous.  Looks like it was color-corrected and plays almost like HD.  My only reason for 3 stars, or it would be less.

Still, Universal dropped the ball.  Commentaries should have been included, featurettes if available, memories from cast and crew that are still with us, and even a couple of trailers and/or TV Spots.  With adding the 3.1 Sensurround track, it would have been nice to see one of the ""An Event"" trailers for the theatrical release in Sensurround.  The trailer on the UK version is one used for the post-Sensurround release of the film.

Maybe they are waiting for the 35th Anniversary in 2009 to do it up big?  I doubt it.

222506,4,6300181510,"The following is my review of the original release on DVD, let's hope the new one has some great DVD Extras or the scenes made and inserted for the television premiere:

Guess what, this is a film about Los Angeles being destroyed by an earthquake. The special effects are dated yet they still hold up. The film innovated a system called Surrondsound. It used low level sound waves to shake the theater seats, which was a fun gimmick that worked. When they first broadcast the film on NBC, there was a stereo simulcast that used the Surroundsound and it worked. Too bad they don't have that on the DVD.

Stewart Graff (Charlton Heston) is an ex football player turned structural engineer that is concerned with overbuilding in Los Angeles. He is married to Rene (Ava Gardner) but is having an affair with the widow of a friend, Denise Marshall (Genevieve Bujold). His boss is his father in law, Sam Royce (Lorne Green). George Kennedy plays the hard nosed street cop Lew Slade who is suspended after a high speed chase. The featured cast includes Richard Roundtree as daredevil Miles Quaid, Victoria Principal as Miles manager's sister Rosa, Marjoe Gortner as a store manager obsessed with Rosa and is in the National Guard Reserves, Lloyd Nolan as a doctor and Walter Matthau makes a cameo as drunk.

A young scientist (Geoffrey Duel) accurately predicts a minor earthquake and tells his boss that this could be a precursor to the big one but his supervisors (Barry Nelson and Donald Moffat) don't agree. When the second predicted minor quake happens, the question is what to do.

At the damn, the first quake floods the machinery shaft and drowns a watchman. After the second, a crack is noticed on the damn and the water level is rising.

As the big one hits, everyone is scattered. Denise is walking in the hills, her son is on a bridge over the LA river, Rosa is at a movie, her brother and Miles are at the stunt. Stewart and Rene are outside the office building with her father in the building.

What follows is everyone trying to find their loved ones. Stewart tries to rescue his father in law who is trapped when part of the staircase is destroyed. Denise finds her son on the bed of the LA river with downed electrical wires and approaching water. Slade tries organize survivors. Marjoe lets his activation by the National Guard go to his head. Eventually, most characters wind up at the underground parking lot at Wilson Plaza (actually Arco Towers.)

An aftershock happens, trapping the survivors in the parking lot but the damn burst and threatens to flood the parking lot. In the end, Stewart saves Denise but has to decide to risk his life for his wife.

As in most multiple jeopardy films (better known as disaster films), the star is the disaster. The cast is just decoration. For 1974, this is cutting edge. The filmmakers have never liked earthquakes on previous films. Therefore, they did two things. They built a scale model of downtown LA and Hollywood and the sets were built on springs. This created a realistic destruction of the buildings and the actors did not have to pretend the earthquake, the sets moved under their feet.

222521,4,6300181510,"The year 1974 saw the emergence of the ""Disaster Movie"" hit the Silver Screen. The two big ""Disaster Movies"" that were released were ""Earthquake"" and ""The Towering Inferno"". In addition to both taking place in California, both had great success at the box office thanks to two of the great all-time cast ensembles ever.  While both of these disaster movies had great special effects, they are very different stories.  ""The Towering Inferno"" would completely revolve around the storyline involving a fire on a 135 story skyscraper in San Francisco.  While ""Earthquake"" indicates the movie is about the impact of a catostrophic earthquake, the movie ""Earthquake"" builds a series of smaller intertwined storylines together around the disaster.  The result makes for a very entertaining movie.  But ""Earthquake"" still is a very different movie than ""The Towering Inferno"" in that it has a much ""darker"" ending by most disaster movie standards.

First the all-star cast. And for 1974, this read like a Hollywood Who's Who. Some of these were already legendary Hollywood names - while others were still to emerge as Hollywood names. The cast includes: Charlton Heston, Ava Gardner, George Kennedy, Lorne Greene, Richard Roundtree, and Genevieve Bujold.  Also included in the cast is Victoria Principal.  ""Earthquake"" would be the big breakthrough role for Principal - and this would contribute to Principal landing the role on ""Dallas"" as Pam Ewing.  Finally, a ""cameo"" type appearance is made by Walter Matthau.  Matthau plays a drunk.  There isn't a better person to play a drunk than Matthau - and he doesn't disappoint in this film.

The plot-line involves a bunch of sub-plots of people's lives in Los Angeles, California:  Before, During, and After the Earthquake.  The Earthquake is obviously the central storyline.  In the early part of the movie, we see some small earthquakes start to impact Los Angeles.  It turns out a young College Graduate has made some findings that demonstrated he could predict these earthquakes.  He also predicts the major earthquake that is going to hit Los Angeles.  We are told that this is a 9.9 earthquake - the most devastating earthquake to ever be measured in modern times.  As mentioned, the movie has some incredible special effects - especially for 1974.  But one thing that adds to the movie are the sub-plots.  Here is a quick synopsis of the main ones:

-Charlton Heston plays Building Engineer Stewart Graff who is estranged from his wife Remy (played by Ava Gardner).  Heston is having an affair with a young widowed mother, Denise Marshall (played by Genevieve Bujold).  Heston works with his father-in-law, Sam Royce (played by Lorne Greene) at an Engineering Firm.  Remy is using her influence with her father to stop Stewart's affair with Denise.  The Engineering angle involving Earthquakes will come into play here.

-George Kennedy plays Lew Slade.  Slade plays a Los Angeles Police Officer who has been put on suspension and now is contemplating whether he wants to remain a Police Man.  The role of the LA Police in the Earthquake will come into play here.

-Victoria Principal plays Rosa Amici.  Rosa is being stalked by a Psychotic Grocery Store Worker who also is a National Guard Volunteer.  Good performance by Marjoe Gortner playing ""Jody"" the Psychotic.

-Rosa's brother, Sal is a manager for a Motorcycle Daredevil (played by Richard Roundtree).

-There is a whole story involving a Dam.  There was a mysterious death in an elevator shaft at the Dam as a result of the one of the earlier minor quakes.  When the major quake hits, the Dam holds up....at least until later in the movie.

- There is an airplane bound for Los Angeles.  There is an interesting story involving the plane landing in Los Angeles as the major quake hits.  Within this subplot, there is another interesting plot involving a couple on their honeymoon and how the earthquake is impacting the beginnings of their marriage.

For almost the first hour of the movie, we get to know the characters and are introduced to many of these subplots.  When the actual Earthquake hits, we see how each of the main characters lives are impacted.  After the main Earthquake, we begin to see the subplots come together.  We see different connections of the characters - for example, Lew Slade knows Rosa.  We also see different characters come together - for example, Lew Slade stops Stewart Graff, who is searching for Denise and her son and takes his car (this leads to Stewart and Lew working together).  I happen to be a big fan of the intertwining storylines.  ""Earthquake"" does a good job at this.  The only problem is that when the Earthquake hits - that becomes the central storyline and you are almost left for wanting more in several of the subplots.

Perhaps the best character in the movie is George Kennedy's Lew Slade.  Slade undergoes a terrific transformation following the Earthquake.  At the beginning we see Lew Slade - renegade cop.  One who doesn't follow the rules - and even drinks on duty.  But after the Earthquake, we see Lew Slade transform into a leader in Los Angeles.  Kennedy delivers the most solid performance of the movie.

It's ultimately the triangle involving Stewart, Remy, and Denise that is going to become the main story of the movie.  Toward the end of the meeting, we see this triangle reach an emotional climax that unfolds during this disaster.  I still felt there could have been more dynamics between Remy and Denise as they are trapped in the building together - that would have made things more interesting.

The ending to this movie is going to be most interesting.  It is definitely one of the ""darker"" endings you will see in a disaster film.  It is worth noting, the film opens with a brief education lesson on California Earthquakes - most interesting.  Overall, this is a film that will keep you interested from start to finish.

222523,1,6300181510,"""Earthquake"" (1974) won an Oscar for its special effects, and it was originally presented in the ground-breaking ""Sensurround"" format, in which an extremely low-pitched sound system literally shook the theater seats whenever the movie's tremors and quakes would hit.  As a result, it was a monster hit at the theaters.  But was it any good?  Let's put it this way.  ""The Towering Inferno"" is considered a mediocre film at best and was such a hit it was nominated for Best Picture by the Motion Picture Academy.  ""Earthquake"" was released the same year and was passed over, except for a special Oscar for its admittedly stellar special effects.  That the Academy wanted nothing else to do with it speaks volumes.  In a word, it stinks.

Actually, the title conflagaration doesn't even happen until nearly an hour into the film.  Until then, the audience suffers through 60 minutes of dreadful exposition and laughable character development:  Architect Charlton Heston and Ava Gardner as a bickering middle-age couple, Lorne Greene as Heston's father-in-law (!) and boss, Genevieve Bujold as a struggling actress and Heston's would-be mistress, George Kennedy as a suspended cop, Richard Roundtree as a pathetic Evel Knievel wannabe, Victoria Principal as a sexy Italian bombshell, Lloyd Nolan as a doctor and Barry Sullivan as the director of the Seismatological Institute.  But top casting honors goes to the bizarro miscasting of Marjoe Gortner as a National Guardsman and sex pervert who attacks Principal after the quake hits.  And, yes, that is an unbilled Walter Matthau providing unneeded comedy relief (the film is unintentionally funny enough as it is) as a drunk who drinks his way through disaster.

Other than that, the film has no plot whatsoever.  The quake hits, lasts nearly ten minutes (instead of several seconds like normal quakes) and destroys all of Los Angeles, killing millions in the process.  It's up to Kennedy and Heston to rescue everybody, then half the cast dies and the film ends, leaving the rest of the cast standing in the rubble.  In all, it's a depressing experience.

The cast, with one exception, is mediocre to terrible.  The exception is Bujold, who acts with sincerity and restraint, making her character the one human being among a bunch of cardboard cutouts.  Heston is properly heroic but exhibits none of the charisma of his late '50's-'60's heyday.  Gardner is unbearable as his wife--vulgar, foul-mouthed and irredeamably b*tchy; it's hard to believe she was once a desired '50's sex symbol.  Greene, Nolan and Sullivan do their best with underwritten roles, and Roundtree looks like he wants to fire his agent for his ridiculous role in which he exhibits none of the charisma of his famous ""Shaft"" role.  Kennedy overacts wildly and joins Heston in watching his career go down the drain in a series of dreadful disaster flicks.  As for Gortner and Principal, they are both absolutely horrible, but at least Principal is sympathetic.  Gortner's pervert is simply an embarassment.

As for the technical aspects, the effects are stellar for the era, although the film also contains one of the cheesiest special effects shots I have ever seen:  the blood splattering at the end of the collapsing elevator sequence.  (And do we really need to see the victim with glass in her eye?)  The editing and cinematography are cut-rate at best, and Mark Robson's direction simply stinks.  As for the script, ""The Godfather""'s Mario Puzo reportedly submitted a draft that was heavily rewritten by George Fox, so primary blame for the horrible dialog, cardboard characters and lack of coherant plot has to be placed on Fox and Robson, who handles everything like a blind traffic cop.  In short, it's a mess, and viewed without the sensurround, the film loses the only jolt it packed in the theater.  The only good thing about the film?  The eerie musical score.

As for the DVD, even if you disagree with me and like this film, skip this presentation.  It features horrible sound and a mediocre picture and is typical of Goodtime Videos cheapjack presentations.  It's in panavision widescreen, but still looks awful, and may be prone to ""sticking,"" much like other Goodtime titles.

I recalled seeing a scene at the theaters - the Marjoe Gortner/Victoria Principal 'peep' scene - that was strangely not present. I just figured it was something that I had imagined and wrote it off as a kid memory.

 UNTIL last night. I was watching AMC during their broadcast of 'Earthquake' and sure enough - there was the scene. Minus the nudity, of course. DAMNIT - I *knew* I didn't imagine that scene!

Look I'm not some adolescent hoping to scope a one-second boob shot. Any cheesy web search brings a horde of incredibly worse imagery. What I am is a film fan wanting to see the movie *as it was intended*.

I avoid buying from Goodtimes like the plague. I would say this dvd is excellent quality comparred to anything else I've seen from Goodtimes besides ""Airport 75"". The quality of picture is just like the video. No new enhancments or re digitalized or anything. The picture is as good (if not a touch better) than what you'd see on vhs or television, so it is worht buying for a low cost. The sound quality SHOULD'VE been redone in DTS or Dolby Digital just because of the old Senssurround that went with this movie. However the sound quality on this dvd is in mono, the quality is not that bad for what you've heard before on vhs or television. I would say, if this is the only release on DVD available, it is worth buying if you loved this movie. The ONLY other dvd release by Goodtimes Video that was done ok was ""Airport 75"". ALL other dvds released by this company have been horrible and not worth a nickle. ""Airport 77"" was absolutly horrendous to watch on their dvd.

222526,4,6300181510,"""Earthquake"" was a late entry into the early '70s Disaster film mania, and the audiences had become a little jaded after whetting their appetites on ""Towering Inferno"" and ""The Poseidon Adventure."" But hey!  ""Earthquake"" has its own charms and some surprisingly good special effects.
Charlton Heston is in his stone-faced glory playing a heroic engineer who is trying to save Los Angeles from a devastating 7.2 earthquake. Dams break, buildings tumble, glass flies, panic and hysteria reign.  Beautiful Ava Gardner (who looked as if she was seriously wondering what in the [heck] she was doing in this movie) plays Heston's spoiled, expensive wife. To give Heston the proper angst, he has reluctantly fallen in love with the nubile Genevieve Bujold who fetchingly needs rescuing quite often.  The ending surprised me; I wonder if Charlton insisted upon it.
""Earthquake"" delivers.  If your expectations are for deep characterizations and startling ambiguities; you will be disappointed.  If you want a couple hours of thrills and mindless fun, ""Earthquake"" will satisfy.  My only complaints are the overly long set-up before the earthquake begins and a vague sadness that I haven't the facilities for ""Sensurround.""

222527,5,6300181510,"Hollywood in the 1970's was the era of the disaster movie. With advances in special effects and stereo sound, they were a wonderful showcase for these advances. By 1975 when Earthquake was filmed, the standard for the genre had been set and Earthquake took it to new heights.
Centering around the usual big name stars and relationship melodrama, the storyline actually works hand in hand with the 'earthquake' rather than overshadowing or hindering it. It is not long until the big earthquake hits and we see the characters deal with the consequences in their own ways.
Whilst the technology of the day was tame by today's standards, the special effects in Earthquake are nothing short of spectacular, if somewhat imperfect on places (the badly edited dam bursting sequence and the elevator - blood on lens scenes being 2 that come to mind). Though the big drawcard was the sound. A new system had been developed called sensurround (basically big massive bass speakers installed in the theatres to give a realistic impression of being there), and it is here where the auditory senses become overwhelmed with the deafening rumble of the earthquake (especially with a good home theatre set up). Towards the end, when Charlton Heston is crawling through the tunnel to pick up a rock to mark an 'X' on the wall, shivers are sent up the spine as the scraping of rock on rock is reproduced with exceptional clarity.
The picture on the DVD is almost perfect - considerably effort has been made to clean up the original 70's grainy film. Perhaps a little too perfect in places - slight shimmering and anti-aillising can be seen occasionally throughout the movie. Extras are disappointing though - only a trailer is included (which shows the best bits of the earthquakes' special effects). If there was no 'behind the scenes' documentary made at the time, it would have been nice to have an interview with a member of the original FX team to discuss how the effects were created.
Whilst tame by today's standards, and perhaps a little too '70's' in feel, Earthquake is at the pinnacle of 70's disaster movies - a genre that at its height of popularity, made the studios a lot of money, and gave the audience thrill of a ride.",1054944000,6,2216,4.788511749347259
222538,5,6300181510,"I am writing this review to one of my favorite childhood films as an act of furious rebellion against Leonard Maltin's unjust ""BOMB"" rating in his Movie/Video Guide. Is the 1974 disaster classic ""Earthquake"" a BOMB? (Shaking head ""No"" in best Maltin fashion) Certainly not! Is ""Earthquake"" a five star film? (Shaking head ""Yes"") Of course it is!
""Earthquake"" lovers across the globe must unite. We cannot allow Maltin's terrible injustice to continue a day longer! I say lobby for two stars today. Tomorrow? Perhaps four. But the ""Earthquake"" rebellion is still in its infancy, and we must take whatever star we can get.
Granted, we cannot watch this film in Sensurround (as I did as a child), but we can turn the volume up to maximum power during the main earthquake sequence. For those unaware, ""Earthquake"" won two Academy Awards for special effects. And the special effects, even by today's computer generated standards, are extraordinary. From dams bursting, to building's collapsing, to Walter Matthau trying to sip his giggling shot of whiskey, the action sequences in this film are unforgettable.
Let's not forget Charlton Heston's modified Blazer (complete with telephone!), which has to be one of the coolest movie autos since Steve McQueen's ""Bullitt"" Mustang. Of course, I have always tried to figure out how Lorne Greene could have fathered Ava Gardner at the tender age of seven. But hey! Weirder things in cinema history have happened (Kevin Costner following ""Waterworld"" with ""The Postman"" comes to mind).
But I digress. What I love about ""Earthquake"" is the beautiful Genevieve Bujold (""You made love to me with such anger."") as Chuck's mistress. She's a great cinema beauty. I love the salty George Kennedy as the tough cop we would all like to have on our block (""Earthquakes bring out the worst in people.""). I love the seedy bar he goes to after a bad day on the job, complete with bald pool sharks, beads hanging in the doorway and the already-mentioned Mr. Matthau (""Bobby Riggs!"") adorned in plaid bell bottoms and maroon pimp hat. Let's not forget Richard Roundtree as motorcycle daredevil Miles Quade (""Baby I'm tuned to just the right pitch!""), preparing for his loop-de-loop stunt just as the earthquake hits.
And finally, the moral choice Charlton Heston is forced to make by the film's conclusion. His wife (Ava Gardner) is being swept away in a flood, a few dyed hairs out of place, her white pants suit literally getting soaked! Chuck looks up through the manhole opening, where he can see the lovely Ms. Bujold staring back with concern. Paradise. Passion. A new start with the woman of his middle age dreams. What's he gonna do!?
By the film's final scene, the distinguished Lloyd Nolan stares at the crumbled buildings amidst the smoke and fire, dirt and sweat covering his tired face. He says to no one in particular, ""This used to be a hell of a town."" George Kennedy, tears in his eyes, shakes his head in agreement as John Williams' terrific musical score closes the show.
To call ""Earthquake"" a BOMB is entirely missing the point of why we watch and love films. ""Caligula"" is a BOMB. ""Earthquake"" is an immensely watchable, loveable pet. A testament of an era, line after quotable line, glorious like a funhouse at the local carnival. A few mirrors may be cracked and the hinges may squeak, but Mr. Maltin, this funhouse makes me smile. If ""Earthquake"" is a BOMB, then I wish Hollywood would make more of them.",1051920000,8,3451,4.870748299319728

I was very happy to find that the Goodtimes release of Universals ""Earthquake"" was widescreen and in dolby stereo surround.  The picture and sound quality exceeded my expectations which were low due to the budget price.  Frankly, I didn't buy this movie on Laserdisc because the MCA-Universal release was priced a little to high for a seventies disaster flick.

222540,4,6300181510,"As a producer the late Jennings Lang has been known for doing really lame sequels to movies like Airport, but on occasion he's turned out some cracking good movies, and Earthquake is one of these.  Set in Southern California along the San Andreas Fault line, Earthquake is the story of several people who are brought together when the mother of all quakes hits LA: Stewart Graff (Charlton Heston), an ex-football player-turned construction engineer who is cheating on his demanding, attention-hungry wife (Ava Gardner) with the widow of a man he had once worked with (Genevieve Bujold); Sam Royce (the late Lorne Greene), Graff's father-in-law and boss; Lew Slade (Airport perennial George Kennedy), a tough LA cop who has just been put on suspension and who now finds himself helping with the rescue efforts following the quake; Miles Quade (Shaft's Richard Roundtree), a daredevil motorcyclist who is also pressed into service in the rescue efforts; and Victoria Principal as the sister of Quade's manager and best friend, who is also the recipient of some very unwelcome attention from a young man (Marjoe Gortner) who works at the grocery store where she shops and who is also an Army reservist who is pressed into service to prevent looting in the aftermath of the quake.
Although I found Earthquake to be a very entertaining film, I did have some problems with the DVD release.  For one thing, there are no special features on it apart from some production notes on the film.  You would think that a movie that inspired a ride at Universal Studios' theme parks would have some featurettes from the surviving cast and crew, but nada!  I also had issues with the fact that certain scenes included in several television airings as well as the original theatrical release were left out of both the VHS and DVD releases, scenes that I felt were somewhat important to the story and should have been included, at the very least in a ""deleted scenes"" section of the DVD.

222542,1,6300181510,"Although I usually get a kick out of watching the Seventies' disaster flicks, I have to say I was kind of hoping the quake would kill off most of the cast in this one, since the characters are so underdeveloped and unlikeable, I didn't care what happened to any of them.  Charlton Heston, jaw firmly clenched, stars as an engineer in a bad marriage and beginning an affair with struggling actress Genevieve Bujold.  His wife is played by a screeching, over the top Ava Gardner, and her father is played by Lorne Greene (ok ... think about that for a moment) who happens to be Heston's boss.  Others include the necessary George Kennedy as a frustrated cop, Richard Roundtree as a daredevil motorcyclist, and Victoria Principal as Roundtree's partner's sister.  If you thought Principal had big hair in her Eighties' soap opera days, get a load of the 'do they put her into in this film.  I don't know how she managed not to tip over from the weight of it!  She must have been left with back problems.  But back to the story, or what there is of it.  A huge earthquake strikes Los Angeles, placing the lives of all these fine citizens in peril.  Skyscrapers fall, buildings explode, fires are everywhere, floods begin.  Other than a mild interest in the Bujold character and her son (she's the only touch of class in this movie), I didn't like or care about anybody else, and if you don't have that, the film is pretty much over after the special effects stop.  The effects are good for the most part, but the script and direction and acting are so poor they ruin the rest of the film.

By, the time ""Earthquake"" was released in 1974, film audiences had already been treated to big guns of the disaster movie canon:  ""Airport"", ""Poseidon Adventure"", and ""The Towering Inferno"".  By now, Hollywood had perfected the disaster film formula.  It includes the macho leading man who has all the answers and leads people to safety (while typically battling a failing marriage and worrying about his mistress), the all-star cast, the clueless people who ignore warning signs and act stupid when the disaster occurs, the silly rescue sequences, the cheesy (but fun) special effects of the disaster, and, most importantly, George Kennedy(!).  The macho guy in this movie is ... Charlton Heston, who is dealing with a crumbling marriage to Ava Gardner while carrying on an affair with a young Genevieve Bujold.  All the while, his business partner and father-in-law, Lorne Greene, turns a blind eye to the marital problems.  There are a few scenes where some scientists predict the earthquake coming and where some dam workers are affected by the early tremors.  There are a few other generic 'slice-of-life' caricatures going about their lives completely oblivious of the impending doom.  None of the characters are the tiniest bit memorable.  Once the earthquake actually starts, the movie gets moderately entertaining.  The special effects are cheesy, but it still is amusing to watch.  Of course, the earthquake is the big thing in this movie.  The story had little cohesion prior to the disaster and almost none after the disaster.  There are just a bunch of rescue attempts and scenes of general anarchy in the aftermath.  All in all, there is very little to recommend this movie.  It is nothing more than a generic, paint-by-numbers disaster flick.

Fires! Adultery! Floods! Duplicity! Electricity! Motorcycle stunts! Earthquakes! Marjoe (aieeee!)! The special effects range from great (Capitol Records building, Wilshire Collonade) to the pits (the elevator, the cows), the script is at the level of a movie-of-the-week, and the acting? Velveeta city. Charlton Heston runs all over the place looking as if he wants to part something, Ava runs around screeching her dialogue as if she were trying to read it over the sound of a departing jumbo jet, Lorne Greene looks as if he can't quite get why he was cast as Ava's father (they were the same age), Genevieve Bujold gives quite a hint of the scary elf she would late become, and best of all, Victoria Principal (in what must be the funniest wig in the history of cinema) ACTS. Yes, before she refined her craft on ""Dallas"" (point chest, tear up, sniffle, whine) she showed her early technique here (point chest, sneer, read line). There is also the big time debut (and thankfully, swan song) of Marjoe, as the... oh well, you'll just have to see for yourself to believe it.
Fans of Debralee Scott's scenes will be disappointed- they are not included, since this is the theatrical version, not the padded version that was shown on NBC. This is a great loss, since I would love to see her big scenes; reacting to the card reading she gives her husband (who knew that an ordinary deck of cards could say ""the plane will not crash, but your career will"") and her loooooooooooooooooooooong scene reacting to the same piece of film showing the runway her plane is trying to land on cracking over, and over, and over, and over.
As a side note- the night before the 94 Northridge quake, I had the flu. I was watching this very same movie. My roomate asked me why I didn't go to bed if I was sick. I replied that ""I like the part where LA falls apart"". I had quite the wake-up call at 5 am.

Neither of us had seen it before so our expectations weren't high.  But wow ... only hours after living through the largest earthquake experienced by the Seattle area in decades, this movie really hit the spot.

Not because it's a ""quality movie"", mind you, but because it's cheesier than a good pizza.  We were laughing from start to finish; we even had to revisit several scenes with the rewind button, either to catch something we'd missed from laughing too hard, or just to confirm our incredulity from what was going on.  (""What?  There's *phosgene* in the office building?  WHY?!?!"")

Two weeks later, we showed ""Earthquake"" to some coworkers and it was a huge hit.  A bunch of us, watching a grainy VHS image projected onto the wall of our conference room, and we laughed ourselves silly.  In fact, this movie is even better when viewed in large groups.  Get everyone together -- especially if you've been through an earthquake lately -- and have a party.  Personally, I haven't laughed this hard at a cheesy movie since ""Fire Maidens of Outer Space"".

So ... this movie is a splendid comedy, through and through, and each of the performers give it their all.  From big-shots Charlton Heston and Ava Gardner, all the way to the minor players, especially the technician at the dam and the city engineer in the sewer.

With todays home theater I was surprised to learn that this version does not have the wonderful sound that was on the origional movie.  We own a wonderful home  theater with a terrific huge sub-woofer. It would have sounded great, had  the movie not been reproduced cheaply.  Mono sound on a Supposely Dolby D.  surround.  Other wise if you do not mind a plain sounding earthquake, buy  this DVD.",948672000,,450,4.5375
222564,3,6300181510,"Definitely the cheesiest disaster movie of all time! Charlton Heston absolutely hams it up (ala ""Ben-Hur"") as a construction engineer, Ava Gardner plays his wife....and Lorne Greene's daughter (?!), Genevieve  Bujold pouts about as Heston's tarty mistress and George Kennedy is the cop  with a heart (there's always one). A devastating quake finally hits LA.  Things begin to shake, rattle and roll - especially busty Victoria  Principal (in a really bad afro wig). The best part of this movie is  watching LA crumble. Some of the quake effects are great - others are  embarrassing. Still, it's still a fun disaster flick to watch. This  reviewer would have given an extra star had the DVD included Dolby Digital  Surround sound. Why show ""Earthquake"" in mono?",937094400,7,760,5.07258064516129
222565,5,6300181510,"While EARTHQUAKE is considered ""corny"" today, at the time of its release, it was THE most complex and special effects intensive film ever released. Filmed at a cost of 7.5 million, EARTHQUAKE somewhat re-defined  the disaster genre. Although Mario Puzo is given co-credit for writing the  screenplay, in fact, he had nothing to do with the final film you see. His  orignal script was so complex that it was, at the time, unfilmable. George  Fox did the re-writes keeping only the names of a few characters from Mario  Puzo's orignal. The final film follows the George Fox ""Shooting  Script"" quite closely with a few minor additions by director Mark  Robson.  The film introduced SENSURROUND, which could duplicate the  waveform of the 1972 Sylmar quake. In many theaters, nets had to be  installed on the ceiling to catch pieces that were shaken loose during the  SENSURROUND scenes, and structural damage did occur to a few theaters...  nevertheless, it was a very, very cool effect. The bass in theaters today  is downright anemic sounding when compared to the SENSURROUND system.
One  interesting thing about the film is that the actors did almost all thier  own stunts. Very few stand-ins were used for the main characters. Even Ava  Gardner did her own stunts, and Genevieve Bujold suprised the filmmakers by  being quite strong and very good at doing her own stunts!
The scenes that  are part of the telecast version of EARTHQUAKE were NOT part of the orignal  OR part of the orignal script. They were written and filmed a few years  later and in no way match the orignal footage. In fact, the television cut  clearly states that Mark Robson directed ONLY the theatrical version. The  first NBC showing of EARTHQUAKE was accompanied by an FM radio simulcast  with the SENSURROUND rumble. It wasn't in stereo however, just mono FM. The  film was shown theatrically in both optical mono and 4-track magnetic  stereo, both with SENSURROUND. There were a few 6-track 70mm prints made in  Europe.",930528000,7,1997,4.904191616766467

7804554,2,6300181510,"BLU-RAY: Disappointing transfer or a bad release print! I can not work out whether there is a large amount of grain or something is up with the compression on this blu-ray copy, but it is rotten. The picture is sharp and no artifacts are present, it is just this merky muck lurking throughout the film. There is also to much ambient sound masking the very low frequencies from the sub woofer. If you can up the power on the sub only, then you will be surprised at the room shaking the furniture and the widows rattling. The frequencies are so low you can clearly see the cone moving in and out. Careful you don't poke the voice coil out the front of the speaker. Anyone care to comment on the picture quality? Speak up!

7804558,4,6300181510,"This is really quite an exciting ""disaster"" film, especially with the limited special effects they had in 1974 (as opposed to our computer effects now).  It is only rated a 5.8 on IMDB which I think is just crazy.... it should really rate about a 7.5.  The film never drags even though the first 55 minutes is build-up to the actual huge earthquake.  There are a lot of sympathetic characters to get invested in and worry about, and therefore you get a nice emotional release when the disaster is over. Give this film a chance :)",1517097600,,529,4.489583333333333
