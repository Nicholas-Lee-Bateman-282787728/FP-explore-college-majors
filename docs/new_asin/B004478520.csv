Happily the creators have followed closely the story-lines of Herve's originals.
I can heartily recommend these DVDs.",1346976000,,356,6.1
8415878,5,B004478520,"Always a big fan of Tin Tin. Dvd's are as I remember the show the few times i got to see it. Plays great on my old dvd player,however it's hard to start on my first gen blu-ray player. No menu will display on my BR player and after the intro it says no signal. After pushimg every button I just pushed play and it started. I had to then pull up the info screen overlay to change to english and change episodes, but it also plays great once started. I'm sure this is a issue with the old blu-ray player and not the disc set. If you encounter this problem also just push play or bust out your old dvd player.",1328313600,,606,3.9754098360655736
8415879,5,B004478520,As enjoyable to watch as when first viewed on television years ago. Very good animation. Stories are fun and adventurous. Nice complement to the recent motion picture.,1326499200,,167,5.222222222222222
8415880,5,B004478520,"The contents of Les Aventures de Tintin vol. 2 (French and English spoken) are
as follows (English language titles, for I'm an English language fella)
The Crab with the Golden Claws
Tintin in Tibet
The Blue Lotus
The Calculus Affair
The Cigars of the Pharoah
The Red Sea Sharks
The Secret of the Unicorn
Red Rackham's Treasure
The Castafiore Emerald
Tintin and the Picaros
These adaptations are very faithful to the books, as far as the plots go.
Missing is the fanatical attention to detail and use of photo reference that obsessed Herge
later on in the novels.  That being said, the animation is up to the standards of the time, and it
steadily improves as the series progresses (much like Herge as he took on more collaborators and found
focus in his books.)
I have included a episode list because as far as I can tell, Amazon is lacking one for this set.  The internet is kinda short on episode lists as well, so cheers, everyone gets to benefit from my purchase of this wonderful set.  If anybody reading this has a episode list for vol. 1 (Les aventures Tintin, with royal blue cover) publishing it would be much appreciated",1325980800,14,1130,4.611940298507463
8415881,5,B004478520,"I grew up reading Tintin books, so watching these takes me down memory lane. The dvds are pretty accurate reproductions of the books. A few tiny scenes may be left out, but take nothing away from the story.

""The Adventures Of Tintin, v. 1 & 2""
------------------------------------------------
These animated cartoon adaptations of the much-beloved Tintin comics books are surprisingly good. While there's a higher level of detail and craftsmanship in the original books by Herge, these cartoons capture the essence of the stories and stay true to the tone (and text) of the books, and hit many of the same comedic notes. The animation is simple but effective, and the ""live"" action aspect brings something new and fun to the stories -- the cartoons don't have the same immersive, mesmerizing effect as the books, but they are fun and won't disappoint most longtime Tintin fans (or their Tintin-fan parents!) Also nice is that each episode is presented in both English and French versions, which is a great educational tool for anyone who wants to learn French. The voiceovers are generally good, although I think the French voice actors are better (Captain Haddock, in particular) and the graphic design is strong, taking its cues pretty closely from the Herge originals. One downside is that the faithfulness to the Herge books means that many of the borderline racial stereotypes remain intact as well; if it's a concern, you can talk your kids through it, otherwise, if you've read the books, you know what to expect.

In a world awash in poorly-conceived, clumsily executed adaptations of great works, these cartoons stand out as gems -- exciting, engaging and amazingly true to the source material.  Definitely recommended. (Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain children's media reviews)",1312848000,11,1624,5.440476190476191
8415883,5,B004478520,"First off, I am a huge fan of Tintin and I grew up reading the comic books in middle school. When I heard about the whole series being in DVD format, I was ecstatic! I couldn't believe that my favorite comic book was in an animated series!

A few things you should know beforehand if you are planning on purchasing this volume:
* The DVDs play seamlessly on US dvd players and televisions
* The DVDs are in ENGLISH (with the option of adding english subtitles if you want to view it in its original French language)
* Each episode is approximately 42 minutes in length.
* A canadian animation company created these episodes- so expect more of a 90's style cartoon theme. (hand drawn scenes, low frame rate, kinda authentic look)
* The episodes, scenes, and characters look EXACTLY as they do in the books! It looks so professionally done, that I couldn't even find a minor flaw in the characters' appearances!
* The voices of the non-major characters fit them perfectly, however the voices of the main characters (Tintin, Haddock, Thomson & Thompson, etc) are not quite suited to their character. But that's my own opinion.
* This is volume 2/2 that you are buying. It is the only US-compatible set that is being sold on the market! Volume one is also sold by amazon and has a blue cover around it.
* On the same site you may find a ""box set"" of volume 1 and 2 on amazon- those are not US region and they are more expensive. The only difference is that they contain individual episodes per disc. This listing for volume 2 has 10? episodes on 3 discs (dual layered dvd) (front and back).

So with that said, now you know what you are getting when you buy the 2nd volume of The Adventures of Tintin!
Although, the animation is no Hanna-Barbera production. The frames aren't seamless, and yes, you will see some blurriness as the scenes (frames) transition. But it doesn't ruin the viewing experience at all, I must stress that! It is very seldom at times and is not very noticeable. If anything, it enhances the film by increasing its vintage look.

The voices are very well done. Though the main characters' voices don't match my preferences, they sound well done for a cartoon. No half---ed job, where its just thrown in for the English speakers. It was actually well cared for and given special attention. The characters' mouths from start to finish match the phrases they speak. And each characters' dialogue is EXACTLY how it appears in the books! Its like reading your comic book as it comes to life in front of your eyes. The scenes and dialogues in the films are so accurate to the nearest plant leaf in the background. You will not be dissapointed I guarantee it! So kudos to the Canadian animists for being accurate.

In some reviews I've read over the animated series (volumes 1 & 2), there are complaints that there is no way each Tintin story could be fit into a 42-minute cartoon. Well, if you think about it 42 minutes of a commercial-free, comic book-into a cartoon, episode is really quite long! Sure there are scenes that don't include a few frames that you would read in the comic book, but on the other hand, the animators are trying to make this into a nicely flowing movie. It would completely detract from the viewers experience if they saw the screen focus on the captain's beer bottle for 3 long seconds and then transition to snowy drinking the puddle of beer for 3 more seconds, and then the screen panning out to some minor character participating in an obscure act. It has to be flowing and relevant to the storyline. And I believe that's exactly what the animators captured with each episode.

And it should be common sense by now that movies created from books will not retain every single scene or insignificant action as written in the book. There just isn't enough time (or relevance) to do it.
I did not feel cheated by these episodes, and felt rather satisfied with my purchase! I highly recommend buying this volume 2 set if you are looking to add value to your movie collection library!
Enjoy!",1300579200,40,4029,4.574792243767313
