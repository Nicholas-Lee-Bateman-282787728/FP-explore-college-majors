5370371,5,B009WSAVLE,"This was my first time trying yoga and this video was easy to follow. I felt that"" ""burn"" when I was done. I highly recommend this to any yoga first timer.",1379116800,,155,4.032258064516129
5370372,2,B009WSAVLE,"Though some of this program did not require them, much of it did require blankets, blocks and a wall against which to stretch.  It would have been nice to know this at the outset of the routine so that I could have started another one - because those things were not readily available to me.  I did enjoy many of the poses/stretches... but there were also many minutes of resting in poses when I didn't have the right equipment available and would have preferred to be more active.  Also, some reviewers mention music, but there didn't seem to be any music in this video.",1377993600,53,571,4.471153846153846
5370373,4,B009WSAVLE,Great Yoga Session. I felt invigorated and happy. Thanks for the lesson.  I will be doing this video instruction again soon.,1377820800,,124,4.904761904761905
5370374,5,B009WSAVLE,"Strikes a pleasant and perfect balance between the necessary explanation for a beginner and stillness to rest. Helps focus on breathing and being present.
 Yet in the middle of the program, felt the stretch and burn. She encourages awareness, adaption and modification to your stretching edge of comfort.
 Was effective. Was worth the exchange of my time. Will return tomorrow.
 Items used are mat, blocks and folded towels or blankets, this last item being the most important.",1377216000,11,477,5.1688311688311686
5370375,5,B009WSAVLE,"Christine does a very nice job.  She's very positive and goes slow. Encouraging.  For beginners to be sure, but it has helped me.  Calm voice.  This was a freebie on Prime to stream, but I'd sure use more of her material as a beginner at Yoga!",1376524800,,243,4.217391304347826
5370376,5,B009WSAVLE,so soothing and calming. the only thing to know..have two blankets and two blocks ready to go. i was as peaceful as baby when i was done. she is also the least annoying yoga instructor ever! perfect for everyday.,1376438400,,212,4.461538461538462

5370378,5,B009WSAVLE,"This video was just as the title said it would be, Easy Yoga for Beginners. It was simple, relaxing, and wonderful. Christine has a gentle soothing voice that helps guide you into the poses andrelease and relax your body. And the music was nice too. Great product. I rented this to try it out at first, but wound up purchasing. It is worth it.",1373673600,10,343,4.375

5370380,5,B009WSAVLE,This Yoga DVD is a must for anyone wanting to start a yoga practice in the privacy and comfort of their own home. Christine's guideance through a beginning practice takes away all the fear of doing something so challenging as starting a new exercise program. Her mind body spirit approach helps you use the practice to not only benefit from it as an exercise program but to take the meditative quality of the yoga into daily life and calmly deal with what occurs throughout your day with peace and poise. Simply wonderfuly.,1352678400,24,523,4.695652173913044
5370381,4,B009WSAVLE,"Program is very gentle and relaxing.  Started out with some easy stretching and postures.  I was waiting for some more yoga flow movements to follow.  For anyone experienced even a little with yoga, the program moves slowly and is more relaxation and slow down than a yoga practice in my opinion.  Instructor is very soothing and focus on breath work is good.",1484524800,,359,4.741935483870968

5370388,5,B009WSAVLE,This video is great for a beginner or like me just getting back in to yoga after many years. I really like how you are not rushed through the poses. They are simple enough for anyone to do but still feel like you have had a good workout.  I also like that the total session is under an hour.,1476921600,,291,3.9322033898305087

5370391,4,B009WSAVLE,"This video makes for a rejuvenating morning practice for people who may not be very flexible. The video begins with sitting poses, moves to a few standing poses, and then ends with supine poses. The sequence is good for stiff muscles and tired joints.",1475280000,,251,4.7272727272727275

5370396,5,B009WSAVLE,Excellent. Helping me build strength back into my muscles after being ill. It does move too fast in prep for next demonstration but the beginning and end are great. Big time stress relief.,1473638400,,188,4.7272727272727275
5370397,4,B009WSAVLE,"I like it. I have done very little Yoga so was starting from ignorance and bliss. I had to scramble to find some of the props, such as blankets and pillows, but most were at hand. And she is on a deck; I was on thick rugs with underlaying mats. She was just a tad fast in some places.  But, after two viewings and efforts, I now know her routine. I have considerably less range of motion than her, enough to make me laugh at times, but that's okay. I do my best. Tryin to keep old bones and joints at least somewhat pliable.",1473552000,,524,4.038461538461538
5370398,4,B009WSAVLE,"It's a great yoga workout, but not for a true beginner. If you didn't know the poses and have some yoga background, this moves so quickly with no instructions on transitioning between poses or how to correctly perform them that you would get lost easily.",1473465600,,254,4.666666666666667
5370399,4,B009WSAVLE,Easy to follow for the first viewing.  Would have been helpful to know that yoga blocks and two folded up blankets would be needed for the end exercises.  She is easy to listen to and relaxing. Was a good workout.  Lasted about 50 minutes.,1473292800,,239,4.386363636363637

5370421,5,B009WSAVLE,"Excellent introduction to yoga with genuinely simple, easily understood, and easily performed practice.  She urges one to move to one's own level, never pressing attempts to strain to reach some ideal position.  She also always suggests modification so that injury would be unlikely.  Her focus on breath, relaxation between postures, and accepting one's body as it is, not as it ideally might be, all make for a strong, appealing, and positive beginning to yoga practice.",1466899200,,472,5.266666666666667

5370426,5,B009WSAVLE,"I used this to get back into yoga after a year off due to surgery.  Great for that, but would also work very well for beginners.  Nice, gently-paced workout.",1465689600,,157,4.379310344827586
5370427,5,B009WSAVLE,"I was looking for something a senior could use to loosen up and help weight.  I watched some that were not really for BEGINNERS at all.

5370429,5,B009WSAVLE,"This is one of my favorite yoga videos on Prime.  I am a beginner with yoga and Christine Wushke never makes me feel bad for being the stiff, uncoordinated person I am.  I don't have any problems following along and doing any of the poses (NOT true with other ""beginner"" videos out there!).  I started doing yoga 3x a week when my doctor diagnosed me with spondyloarthritis (arthritis of the spine) at 34 years old, and I was terrified of a future of immobility and pain.  I probably do this video at least once a week and my spine always feels amazing when I'm done.

5370439,5,B009WSAVLE,"This easy beginner's yoga video makes me happy. This is not for people who want to do Power Yoga or other challenging yoga routine. This is for absolute beginners or for people who are recovering from an injury. I've done yoga for years and my shoulder wasn't quite ready for power yoga. I found this on Amazon Prime and it's helping me get back to my regular working routine. I highly recommend this if you want to stretch, relax and get in touch with your body. You'll need 2-3 yoga blankets, 2 blocks, a yoga mat and a wall (I use the side of my couch).",1462579200,,556,4.254716981132075

5370443,4,B009WSAVLE,This is the perfect yoga video for someone with limited ability to do yoga poses. I had rotator cup rupture surgery a year ago and I can no longer do planks of any kind. I had started to believe I would never find a yoga video that did not involve planking. This is the perfect yoga video if you are only wanting the yoga stretches. I would have given it 5 stars but as you get into the video she uses blankets and blocks and it would be better if she mentioned this before the start of the video.,1461974400,,497,4.03030303030303
5370444,3,B009WSAVLE,"It was okay.  I would have liked to have known about the ""tools"" needed before I started doing the program.  I didn't have a nearby wall, so I had to stop about halfway through.  Otherwise, it was generally good!",1461801600,,212,4.384615384615385

5370461,5,B009WSAVLE,This is one the most relaxing exercise videos I have ever watched. In fact Christine's voice is so smoothing and calming that I decided to listen to the wisdom of my body and just take a nap. I highly suggest this video for beginning yoga or beginning nap time.,1454716800,,261,4.346938775510204
5370462,5,B009WSAVLE,"My doctor recommended buying a beginner yoga DVD or to join a water aerobics class for back pain.  I really lucked out by selecting Christine Wushke's Easy Yoga for Beginners.  After streaming this video with Amazon Prime, I realized this is a must own DVD and I bought it.  It's that great.  The DVD is filmed in Hawaii and Christine goes though the whole video featuring the gentle poses in a serene setting with beautiful scenery and the sound of ocean waves to help achieve relaxation of the brain and body while accomplishing the stretches/poses.  She stresses throughout to concentrate on your breathing and only go as far as your body will go gently today.  I can see myself achieving further stretch point limits with practice over time.  Sometimes DVDs can become monotonous and get to the point where you don't want to watch it anymore.  This one is different.  Once she gets into the pose the picture changes to the scenery and all you need to do is relax and listen to her voice or total silence listening to the ocean and soft chimes.  I highly recommend this to everyone to rejuvenate the soul with wonderful stretches while relaxing.",1454630400,6,1148,4.695

The meditations before and after the workout are so relaxing.  Be sure to have a couple folded blankets and and some blocks or a couple large hardback books that are the same height, nearby.  The entire workout is very relaxing and easy to do.  Do each move to the best of your ability and do not stress yourself trying to do them as deeply as she does at first.  I would do this three times a week until you are completely comfortable with each move, then move on to a more challenging video.  Yoga is probably the best workout for most people.  The movements are slow and graceful, and make you more aware of your body.  The continuing practice of Yoga is great for total health and a strong, supple body.

5370486,5,B009WSAVLE,"This is absolute beginner's yoga. It doesn't require any special strength or flexibility. Heck, I'm about as in-shape as a broken open biscuit can and I'm able to do it. Not only that, I'm getting better at it, and I can feel my muscles actually working, which is pretty cool. I'd say it's a really great stretching routine with mild strengthening.

There are other videos with more emphasis on strength, but I am not in shape enough for those yet. Someday, yes, but for now, this is just perfect.

If I had only watched this once, I would have given it only three stars.

But now, after a week of using it daily, I am rating it five stars... here's why:
1. As many other reviewers noted, you need some stuff for it.
tl; dr: you need stuff and you won't know what you need until you watch the video, and even then, it's going to take some finding.
This is not immediately apparent when you start the video. It just launches right into the poses without saying ""1/3 of the way through, you're going to need to pause this and collect a bunch of stuff that you may or may not have in your house,"" at the beginning. I don't personally have anything except a yoga mat here in the house, so I just stopped the video and gave up on the first watch through. The second watching, I brought over a couch pillow because I didn't happen to have a perfectly folded blanket near. Didn't work. Third watching, I found a blanket, but didn't have blocks. I still don't have blocks, but I use a pillow and it works fine.

2. She almost never tells you when the poses end.
tl; dr: There's minimal instruction so you have to get used to the timing after watching it for a few days.
This was VERY frustrating to me when I started watching the video, because it's really hard to relax and be in the poses fully when you're always having to keep one eye trained to the screen. Now, I don't even look at the screen at all. I figured this would be a persistent problem, but again, after a few days it stops being an issue at all.

3. It takes an hour.
tl;dr: it takes a fricken' hour.
You might say that no amount of time is too great for the relaxation and toning that this restful yoga video provides, but, dude, I'm busy. The reason I'm even watching this at all is because I'm too stressed out because I have stuff to do (also, that whole broken-open biscuit body thing). Taking an hour out of my day is a big investment.

The video has been worth it and I will continue to enjoy it, probably starting to alternate a more strength-based yoga every other day. If you're going to watch this, I recommend giving it at least four days where you can have a consistent place and all your materials set up around you.",1441497600,41,2689,4.283464566929134

5370546,5,B009WSAVLE,"I've done Pilates for years and never felt a need to try yoga. After a recent stomach illness, Pilates seemed too challenging with all of its abdominal work. So I decided to try this. I'm so sorry I didn't try yoga sooner! This video, specifically, has worked wonders for me. Even though I'm 30 and try to stay healthy with a whole foods diet and natural exercise (walking, running) I have fibromyalgia and a lot of back issues. My back is so bad that the few times I've been able to get a massage, the therapist always exclaims, ""Oh wow, that's awful!"" I've done physical therapy stretches and posture work, but nothing seemed to make much of a difference. This video blew me away with the changes in my back in just a few days.

After the first day, I felt sore, but it was the ""good hurt"". Because I have fibromyalgia, that's a rare feeling. A lot of new exercises lead to a very painful flareup. After the second day, I was a little more sore, but it was still a good soreness. More importantly, I noticed my range of motion had improved. Even more importantly, my range of motion had improved AND so had my joint stability. I have hypermobile joints (I've dislocated my shoulder in my sleep a few times) so that was a big deal. After the third day, I was feeling stronger, more flexible, and simply better. I love the restorative poses at the end. I knew that certain physical positions were capable of triggering a physiological response by switching off the sympathetic nervous system and allowing the parasympathetic nervous system to do its thing. I had no idea just how effective those poses would be. I've fallen asleep several times. That's a big deal because I almost never fall asleep somewhere other than my bed, and even that's a struggle.

I will caution that I only felt comfortable trying this with no yoga experience because I've done Pilates for years. I learned Pilates from trained instructors in a class and knew that Joseph Pilates based some of the Pilates movements on yoga. I knew the importance of alignment and attention to certain core things when it comes to something like yoga or Pilates. I wouldn't recommend trying any yoga or Pilates exercise without in-person training from an instructor first. That being said, this video was amazing!!",1410912000,,2274,4.654228855721393

5370556,5,B009WSAVLE,"I love this yoga video for early morning start up or evening relaxation. Great pacing, soft music, ocean sounds, just perfect!",1399593600,,126,5.0476190476190474
5370557,4,B009WSAVLE,"So, I could do about 20 minutes of this video and then I was done. I guess I was expecting more education ""this move is called ""xyz"" and this is how you do it"" but it was more like a workout video",1399334400,,196,3.6904761904761907
5370558,5,B009WSAVLE,"This 1 hour yoga video moves through a brief opening breathing meditation, warmup, a good back series, a series of standing poses, and some restorative poses, ending with savasana.  There's a lot here, but none of it is too strenuous.  It's filmed in Maui, with ocean waves and some lovely scenes during the pauses.  Christine Wushke's voice is clear and soothing.  I come back to this video again and again, even though I'm not really a beginner any more; I find it a good complete yoga session that makes me feel invigorated and peaceful, as yoga is supposed to do.",1398902400,12,567,4.64
5370559,5,B009WSAVLE,"I have lead yoga classes for 13 years. This video is an excellent calming workout. I like the sequencing and the selected positions. I have ""borrowed"" the portions of this video for my own classes. Worth the watch.",1398902400,,214,4.657894736842105
5370560,4,B009WSAVLE,"This is a great video for beginners. Relaxing, yet a good stretching workout. I've rented several videos and found this to be my favorite.",1398556800,,138,4.791666666666667
5370561,4,B009WSAVLE,This was perfect for me today. I have 4 kids and half were in school while the other half were strangely napping at the same time!! I have been in desperate need of some relaxation and this sequence did just that. It's slow paced and easy yet I still got my heart rate going enough to feel like I actually did something today. The last portion of this sequence will really send you into a relaxed state of mind. Be sure you have a few comfy blankets handy and a wall for a few poses. She uses blocks too but I don't have any so I just adjusted as needed.,1398384000,,554,4.045454545454546

5370563,4,B009WSAVLE,I've tried 2 or 3 other yoga videos on Amazon Prime and this has been the most relaxing one so far.  I liked the background sounds (waves/windchime type effects).  The only thing is that I wish she talked a little slower -- the transitions from one pose to the next could have been a bit more relaxed.  Although she mentions using blocks during the exercise I found that I didn't really need them.  You will need 2 blankets towards the end of the video and I'm sure most people have those lying around their houses.,1398038400,,515,4.389473684210526

5370566,5,B009WSAVLE,"This is truly an effective practice for beginners and those suffering from muscular problems.  It would be nice to know beforehand, though, that you will need a stack of blankets, something that I was not expecting, and also a vertical wall.",1396137600,,241,4.878048780487805
5370567,5,B009WSAVLE,we are true beginners and this video not only inspires us but keeps us coming back everyday to learn and become better.  Perfect beginners video,1395964800,,144,4.76
5370568,3,B009WSAVLE,"I enjoyed the poses, and Christine was very easy to follow. I would have liked to know beforehand that you need blankets and blocks to use for poses, as well as a wall. I did not have access to a few of these things, and could not follow along with about 15 minutes of the video because of this.",1395705600,,295,4.016949152542373
5370569,4,B009WSAVLE,"This is a gentle and relaxing beginners video for easy yoga.  The scenery is natural and the speaker's voice is soothing.  A great way to start the day or relax after work.  Lots of good stretching.  If you do this regularly, it's obvious you'll be limber and elongated. This should be a complementary program to walking on the treadmill. Wonderful that this is free with Prime membership - adds to the value of Prime.",1395446400,,418,4.608108108108108

5370573,3,B009WSAVLE,"First of all, I'm no yogi.  I was looking for a yoga class/video to help with flexibility, mindfulness, and simple starter strength building due to injury.  This video is super relaxing, nearly put me to sleep! And I'm looking for something a bit more advanced, having been in a beginners yoga class through a local community center.  However, this video is exactly what I was doing in the classes. Same poses, simple guidance, and the instructors voice is quite soothing.  The one thing I didn't prefer with this video is it is narrated by the instructor, and you watch her do the poses, so there is a personal connection missing.  I like the instructor being able to speak and do the poses with me so she can explain the way you should feel (where you should feel the stretch, etc.), so this video wasn't quite right for me.",1394150400,,826,4.554054054054054
5370574,2,B009WSAVLE,"I had been taking yoga classes as a local studio near my house for a few months and really enjoyed the classes, but it became too expensive to maintain. I really enjoyed the yoga though, so I wanted to try something at home. I found this video very hard to follow. She would go between poses without explaining what to do with your body in between and I found myself having to look up a lot to find out where she was. The pace was good and everything, and she has a nice relaxing voice, but it was just too hard for me to follow.",1393977600,,529,4.0476190476190474
5370575,5,B009WSAVLE,This video is easy to follow yet helps you to understand and master the basics.  I would recommend this video for anyone starting out.,1393891200,,134,4.583333333333333
5370576,4,B009WSAVLE,"I really enjoyed this, great for a beginner like me, but not to easy.  Deep stretches combined with deep relaxation.  However, it would be good to know ahead of time that 2 yoga blocks and 2 blankets are needed as well as that some stretches are performed up against a wall.",1393718400,,274,4.352941176470588
5370577,4,B009WSAVLE,"I have taken yoga before, so for me, this video was simply a refresher on basic poses and breathing focus. The pace was nice and slow, the ""instructor's"" voice was very peaceful.  I will be recommending this video to my husband, who has suffered through only one yoga class before and has very little balance or flexibility.

Be aware: the video voiceover does not tell you of all the things you will need besides a mat.  Among them are foam blocks and towels, but just keep the remote handing for pausing.",1393545600,,506,4.538461538461538

5370579,3,B009WSAVLE,"It's been a while since I did yoga so I wanted to start with a beginner video. Since I did know some yoga, this was too slow paced for me.  That being said, it's a good video and when I want a slower paced yoga workout, I'll watch again.  It would have been good to know that blocks and blankets were needed for the last segment.",1392940800,,329,3.9696969696969697
5370580,5,B009WSAVLE,"We really like this DVD as the instruction is clear and the all you hear is a nice calming voice, the waves crashing on a Maui beach, and a distant windchime!  The stretches and moves and breathing are really great, just enough to have a mild workout, get limber, and clear the mind.  We do it everyday and noticed an immediate improvement in our flexibility and energy and posture!
Great video!",1392768000,,395,4.549295774647887
5370581,2,B009WSAVLE,"I found this very slow moving. I liked holding the poses but it was just a little too easy and too slow. Prior to trying this, I've been doing some of Kanta Barrios videos which have given me a base for yoga and I like them better.
I did not like needing the wall, blankets and blocks. The end sequence was especially slow where it was just relaxing in the poses for like 5 min each. I skipped that part. I'll probably remove this from my watchlist and continue with Kanta Barrios.",1392681600,2,481,4.239130434782608

So many of the others are totally Hollywood or a little to far out there for me, but this is serene and relaxing.  So glad I have Amazon Prime, because I've done this video at least 1/2 dozen times this month.  Great way to start the day.  I wish she had more videos to follow!",1390953600,,392,4.118421052631579

5370585,4,B009WSAVLE,This is a good beginners yoga routine. It also functions well is an a.m. routine. It starts off with gentle movements and ends with restorative yoga that leaves you feeling peaceful and energized.,1390521600,,196,4.96969696969697
5370586,5,B009WSAVLE,"Very slow and soothing with the Hawaiian tropics in the background. Not too difficult, so you don't feel like a total loser trying out Yoga for the first time.  Probably not challenging enough for those with prior Yoga experience. Also, you should note that you need yoga blocks, and two blankets for some of the poses.  A  yoga mat would be nice but not vital.",1389830400,,361,4.523076923076923
5370587,5,B009WSAVLE,"This is one of the easiest yoga sessions I've ever tried. The instructor's voice is soothing and she makes it very easy to follow along.

5370589,3,B009WSAVLE,"I'm giving this video 3 stars because the middle of it is fine. But at the beginning and end there is no warming up or cooling down, just lying down and that's it. Plus you need blankets and blocks, which would've been nice to know at the beginning. I've done other beginning videos which are much better.",1389398400,,305,4.368421052631579

A beginner should have no problem keeping pace.
Recommend for seniors to get started on yoga.",1389312000,,137,4.75
5370591,4,B009WSAVLE,"It was a very nice yoga session with a soothing narration. It has entry level and makes you sweat a bit too. The only down side is that you need blocks, blankets, and a wall, so I had to improvise with throw pillows and my couch. I'll probably be doing this on my off days from cardio. Good video all in all. :)",1389312000,,311,3.9523809523809526

5370595,4,B009WSAVLE,This is very nice and soothing and helps me feel more connected to the world around me. If you are a worry wort like I am it rents for a complete week (or mine did) and you can break it up and do separate parts each night. This helped me to learn to take better care of myself and be more in tune. I found these moments enlightening. I will purchase more of Christine Wushke's work.,1385769600,,382,4.0394736842105265

5370597,5,B009WSAVLE,"I'm so glad I finally watched this one. Very easy to follow and great for a night when you need to calm the heck down. There's a pleasing ocean wave in the background during instruction and during the relaxation poses. As another reviewer noted, blocks are helpful if you have them. You'll need blankets for the restorative poses at the end. Don't skip them! That's the best part!",1384214400,2,380,4.602941176470588

extra time to learn the moves and relax into the poses!",1383091200,,208,4.225

5370601,4,B009WSAVLE,"This is a great video!  Very easy to follow.  She provided great narration on tips for performing the poses well.  She also tells you to not go beyond your limits, and be comfortable in each pose.  All too often, i have heard of people hurting themselves doing yoga.

Just make sure to have two blankets and a free wall before you do this.  I wish she had given instructions about needed materials in the beginning. (I had to pause the video mid way to start moving furniture to free up wall space).",1382659200,,499,4.369565217391305

Just been interested in yoga as another alternative form of stress relief.  So this video seems to be a little too easy for me. And she moves too fast between the poses. I've been watching Jane Fonda's AM/PM Yoga, Yoga Journal: Morning noon and night, and Shiva Rea's Flow for beginners... and none of them switch between poses as fast as Christine. Glad this was free with my Prime membership or otherwise this would not have been worth my money. My favorite is Shiva Rea's Flow for beginners. This video is ok, but there are better ones for beginners.  Even if you're very inflexible, Jane Fonda's video is a good start.",1381276800,,783,4.507042253521127

8544737,4,B009WSAVLE,"This is a relaxing practice that almost anyone can do.  It is meant as a meditative practice, not a fast paced workout. You will get a good stretch, and your brain can let go.  I found the narration, music, and imagery very relaxing.  I gathered blankets and blocks ahead of time, although I barely used the blocks. I found fussing with the blankets to be a pain, and quickly learned to keep the relmote next to me so that I could pause the video long enough to get situated. A bolster, if you have one, might actually more more useful than blankets.  I wish I had realized I should pause the video to get situation earlier on, as I often felt like Id get situated in a pose and then wed be moving on, with little chance to hold it. Perhaps with practice, one could get situated in each pose as smoothly as the instructor - but. It was sometimes a struggle for me, and I felt squirmy for much of the video. Nonetheless, it was relaxing and I did feel much more open, especially in my hips, by the end of the video.",1523059200,,1014,4.211340206185567

Unlike many other beginner videos, the poses are well explained, at a slow and steady pace so you don't feel that there is a lot of dead time but also aren't super rushed and don't understand (hate that in yoga vids!). Also it has a good flow and variety of poses. I love the background wave/wind sounds, it helps you focus on something and is very relaxing compared to other no sound videos. I look forward to doing this video a few times a week to relax and stretch. Then try out some of her other videos.",1515801600,,607,4.333333333333333
