5613238,5,B00BF1LOC6,"Love this DVD.  All 3 workouts are very challenging, but fun.  Like the shorter workouts.  Mike is a great instructor and explains every move with good detail.  Would recommend this DVD",1368144000,7,185,4.870967741935484
5613239,5,B00BF1LOC6,"Thank you Mike! This guy really knows what he is doing. I just did Workouts 1 and 2 (there are 3 altogether) from the DVD for the first time and I honestly didn't think it would be possible to better the first two DVD's from his collection. The workouts are just 30 minutes each and I managed to do them both back to back.

I love the way Mike demonstrates each move perfectly before the timer starts so I knew exactly what to do. The moves in each workout combine the perfect balance of heart-pumping cardio, strength and core. I don't think that there are better combined workouts than this. Apart from the workouts being effective as I was sweating like crazy, felt like I had moved every muscle in my body, I actually really enjoyed myself at the same time! If I am ever short on time, I will do just one of the workouts but I know that I will get every bang for my buck in those 30 minutes. I am looking forward to the weekend as I will try and attempt all 3 workouts in one go.

Thank you again Mike for the excellent stretches at the end. Especially after just wasting my money and trashing Jillian Michael's new ""Hard Body"", I feel completely satisfied.",1366761600,9,1161,4.296803652968037
5613240,5,B00BF1LOC6,"I've only done the first workout, but I can tell I am going to love the other two. I was dripping sweat when I was done and that's just what I wanted.  A real challenge.  This guy is a great instructor.  He's always putting different moves in each new video he comes out with.  I am looking forward to his next one!!",1364947200,15,316,4.048387096774194
5613241,5,B00BF1LOC6,"Mike's workouts are top notch.  All the moves are doable yet challenging.  I loved his first workout, but the three workouts in this program blow the first video away.",1363219200,14,167,4.724137931034483
5613242,3,B00BF1LOC6,"This DVD is just OK. I don't love the instructions for exercises as they tend to be repetitive and waste your time. Some of the exercises are slightly strange in my opinion, and I don't feel the instructor does a good job explaining it. In fact, if you watch the guy in  the back performing the exercises, you'll get a better idea of the correct form. Overall I feel it's intensive, but not enough to even come close to P90x. Anytime in decent fitness level can easily handle level 3 on the DVD. So not much room for growth here.",1378512000,2,529,4.29
5613243,5,B00BF1LOC6,"everything is great about this DVD - the different level options, its very challenging and is only 30 mts.  the only thing bad is the music.  i am not sure if these videos don't like to pay for the music, but music is CRUCIAL.  other than that well worth the money.",1378166400,5,265,4.1568627450980395
5613244,5,B00BF1LOC6,This routine is for anyone wanting an excellent workout.  Mike is a great teacher and makes it easy to follow his routine.  Don't think you will be sorry for purchasing this one!!,1375574400,,179,4.5625
5613245,5,B00BF1LOC6,"I never write reviews but I just had to comment on this workout. This is the workout that Jillian Michaels/Bob Harper/Jackie Warner wish they had made. Not that their workouts are not good but I just find Mike Donavanik's workout absolutely perfect. I am on week 2 of the plan and actually look forward to doing this workout EVERY day, even though at the end I am a quivering, sweaty mess.

You cannot beat the variety that you receive for the price. You get 5 workouts for around $20 plus a plan to implement them (with the free bonus features). Unbeatable.

Mike Donavanik is a super instructor. He demonstrates ALL of the moves and does 90% of the workout, all while encouraging you. He is genuine, informative and down to earth.

I highly recommend buying this workout. I plan on purchasing his other DVDs also.",1374019200,8,815,4.606896551724138
5613246,5,B00BF1LOC6,"I loved working out with this DVD. For anyone who is looking to take the workout to the next level, this is it. I found this challenging. I had not heard about Mike Donavanik until I saw some reviews online; I was happy I purchased it.
Time and again I go to this workout for a challenge! I am currently combining it with a heavy weight series and love the combination!",1371513600,3,369,4.211267605633803
5613247,5,B00BF1LOC6,"This is good for a quick 30 minute exercise, he shows you the correct form, I have only done one of the 30 minute workouts but I'm sure the others will be the same type.",1371340800,2,169,3.857142857142857
5613248,5,B00BF1LOC6,"Good workout, I am happy with the product! Will be part of my rotating work out DVD's and I am selective.",1370995200,2,105,4.0476190476190474
5613249,5,B00BF1LOC6,"The word extreme is very freely used nowadays in the title of workouts, but this one deserves every single letter of it. It is 45 minutes of intense and very enjoyable pain. If you are one of those types who are addicted to the endorphine rush at the end of a workout, you are in the right place. Mike's cues are great and he is very motivating. Overall, this is a gem for advanced fitness junkies.",1370908800,4,398,4.25
5613250,5,B00BF1LOC6,I really enjoyed Mike workout dvd's.  Very easy to follow and makes you workout a good sweat.  I could honestly his DVD is the main one that I continue to pop in,1370390400,4,161,4.0
5613251,5,B00BF1LOC6,"I have all of Mike Donavanik's workouts and I love them. They are incredibly well-cued, well planned and they really get the job done. Extreme Burn: RIPPED is my favorite. I like the fact that all the moves get your heart rate up and so you are working aerobically the entire time. You can use medium or heavy weights for all the moves, and he has a modifier demonstrating the moves for the beginner/intermediate exerciser. He also has a modifier who shows how to ramp up the intensity of each move if you want that as well. I usually do all three workouts,but only do one warm up, one core routine and one cool down. Even though this is an advanced workout, a beginner could easily do this with light weights and get a great sweat going. None of the moves are complicated. Mike is a great motivator without being annoying or condescending. He really has THE BEST ab routines out there. They are killers. You will not be disappointed.",1368576000,16,934,4.5
8567516,5,B00BF1LOC6,I really only do level 2 because that's the one I like the best and has the least amount of plyo (bad knees).  Great workout and he is very engaging - right amount of seriousness.,1528588800,,179,4.114285714285714
8567517,5,B00BF1LOC6,"I would say I am in decent shape. I have run three half-marathons, usually once per year, pacing about 10-min miles, so in shape, but not a crazy person. I also enjoy hiking and backpacking in the mountains.  I am too cheep to buy a gym membership, so in the winter when I can't run, I do workout dvds. I have dozens of Jillian Michaels and Billy Blanks. Of all of my dvds, this is by far my favorite. The exercises are designed to work you very hard without being frustrating or boring. A lot of the moves are combinations (like a kick into a burpee), which I like because if I have to do straight burpees for a minute, by the end I start slacking off. The instructor is perfectly encouraging, informative, and well-paced. There is a timer so you know exactly how much longer the exercise will take. All of the workouts are great, and in only 30 min, which I like because I do them in the morning before work, and I really don't want to give up too much sleep. If you already like instructors like Jillian Michaels, you will love this dvd. Highly recommend.",1500249600,,1058,4.316582914572864

8567521,2,B00BF1LOC6,"I'm giving this a 2 stars because the video setup is extremely annoying. It has 3 segments and you can select the segments you want. For this reason, alone I hardly ever use this video, eventhough the workout is decent. If I had to do it over again, I would use the money for something else.",1430956800,,291,4.214285714285714

8567525,5,B00BF1LOC6,"I have many workout DVD's. This one supplements my other workout DVD's. It's a good, quick workout. He needs to make more DVD's like this one. I'd buy it.",1381622400,5,154,4.344827586206897
