3498175,5,B001BSBBDA,"Watching this movie in color is like seeing it for the first time again.
And the nice extra is that it also has the black and white version on the dvd also which is restored. Great purchase!!",1239753600,6,191,4.1891891891891895
3498176,5,B001BSBBDA,I have only owned about 2 or 3 versions of this film and I have to say this is probably the best.  For the price you really cant go wrong with both versions the black and white and color.  Its not like its in high definition or anything but the quality is good enough for me to say its almost the best I have seen for an older version of this.  Not much more can be said about Night of The Living Dead but it is the all time classic zombie movie that paved the way for so much garbage zombie films and the good ones.  No doubt in my mind that a company is trying to make more money off a good movie with a new version but at least this one is worth it.  Special features are rather disappointing but I think it makes up for it by the commentary track.  Odds are if you have never seen this movie and this is your 1st than you might be disappointed by the claustrophobia of the whole film except the beginning but for me I enjoyed that aspect of being in one place.  The zombies move about the pace of a turtle so I think it would be fun to play with these zombies over the current run after you aggressive type.  You might find yourself wondering why anyone is scared of them except for they want to eat you.  I have to say though that a slower pace and claustrophobia is a good feeling in a movie for me especially a zombie movie.  Overall in my opinion this is still the definitive zombie movie (not so much the dvd) for me.,1230336000,3,1426,4.007067137809187
3498177,5,B001BSBBDA,"The item was received quickly, and will be given as a gift for the holidays.  Cannot speak for the integrity of the DVD, but it is sealed and the DVD is expected to be in great condition.  Great seller.",1229040000,,202,4.153846153846154
3498178,4,B001BSBBDA,"What more needs to be said about Night of the Living Dead? The word ""cult-classic"" is practically defined through the experience of watching Romero's magnum opus...

Nevertheless, for the savvy shopper, this is perhaps the best version of the film to-date, because it's essentially a three for one. Not only do you get the original black and white film in all of its terrible glory, but this new DVD release also contains a newly colorized version (that also features 5.1 surround sound) that provides a completely different viewing experience for even the most ardent fan, and is that much more likely to interest the younger generation. Additionally, this version contains a hilarious, heckling ""audio commentary"" by Mike Nelson, of Mystery Science Theater 3000 fame. The commentary itself is worth buying in of itself, as anyone who has chanced across MST3K before can attest.

From what I can tell, this version is the best bang for you buck, since you get those three distinct experiences for the same money as just buying the black and white version. Get to it!",1227225600,4,1067,4.955307262569832

3498195,5,B001BSBBDA,"I can't say whether it's better or not in color, it would depend on if you're an original version snob, I don't mean that in a rude manner, maybe I should say ""purist""? I personally enjoyed this movie in color. But I'm also a huge fan of this movie so I'm just happy to own it in any version...but imo the color was cool. My movie was delivered on time, in perfect condition and I can recommend this seller and the color version of the movie. In fact it's kind of amazing how they made it appear as if it had been filmed in color. I have one of my all time favorite flicks so I'm a happy woman.",1453507200,,594,4.0

3498198,5,B001BSBBDA,"When I first saw ""Night of The Living Dead"" it wasn't the full movie that I saw, but was actually on a TV show in 1986 called ""Mad Movies"" where they re-dubbed all the voices to make it a very funny short movie. (If you've never seen it, look it up on YouTube ""Mad Movies Night of The Living Dead""), it is hilarious. Anyway, I was 14 and up late watching TV that night and ""Mad Movies"" came on around 11:00pm and I laughed my butt off. But then a few years later I rented the full length film and I really liked it a lot. I thought the acting was pretty bad, but I still enjoyed it, and I still enjoy it to this day.
  Now for this DVD, I normally do not like the colorization of old Black and White Movies, but this one looks pretty darn good in color. I was amazed at how real they got the car to look as a red color when in the black and white version it just looks like a plain old white car. I still prefer the movie in black and white though. The movie itself is what I would consider to be a classic. Although not a scary film, it does have some parts that are creepy. Even without the ""Mad Movies"" version, I still actually find some parts of ""Night of The Living Dead"" to be funny and I find myself laughing at those same parts since I first saw the movie over 25 years ago. Like when Ben says ""Yea this place is boarded up pretty solid now."" Meanwhile there is a wide open window directly behind him that doesn't have a single board nailed to it. And speaking of laughing...this DVD features a commentary track by Mike Nelson from MST3K that is great and he had me laughing even more. A Blu Ray copy of this movie would have been better, but this DVD still looks great and even though the acting is mostly pretty bad, it is still, in my opinion, a fun film to watch and enjoy.",1409702400,2,1786,4.0423728813559325
3498209,5,B001BSBBDA,"I originally purchased this for a Halloween party and while everyone still got the creeps watching this film, I watched it again the next night--alone!! This is a true horror classic. Films like Halloween or Friday the 13th got their inspiration from this fabulously scary film. Also a true treat to enjoy colorized (great quality!!) or black and white. Boo!!!",1395792000,,360,5.016666666666667
3498210,5,B001BSBBDA,"I am no fan of the zombie genre.  Mainly because I feel it has run its course.  It has just become tired and formulaic.  There are many fans of ""The Walking Dead"" which is all well and good, I have no problems with that, but I have avoided it because as I said I think the genre has run out of new ideas.

However I am a huge fan of the movie that invented the zombie genre.  The original version of ""Night of the Living Dead"" has stood the test of time for five decades now.  Everything works in this movie, the script, the cast and the genuine moments of pure horror.  It is very easy to see why this movie is considered a classic.  Watch it once and you will see why.

One day at dusk a young lady named Barbara and her brother John take a long drive to a Pennsylvania cemetery to put flowers on their father's grave.  Soon after they complete the task a strange man suddenly approaches them and attacks Barbara.  Johnny intervenes to fight off the man but is killed when his head strikes a gravestone.  The man, who appears to be totally delirious then goes after Barbara.  Barbara manages to make her way to an isolated farmhouse where she meets a stranger named Ben.  Soon more people acting as oddly as the man who attacked Jon and Barbara begin to appear.  Ben begins to barricade the house and the two work to try to stay alive until help arrives.

I have mentioned previously the reasons why I feel this movie is so terrific.  Now it is even more terrific now that it is available on this DVD in color.  The colorization is very well done and adds another quality to a great movie.  It even makes it, in my opinion, even better.  Any fan of this movie should see the colorized version.  They won't be disappointed.

If you have not seen the original version of ""Night of the Living Dead"" do so by all means.  If you have seen it, make sure you see it in color.  You will enjoy the movie even more.

One last note.  The 1990 remake of ""Night of the Living Dead"" is actually very good too.  Obviously not as good as the original classic, but worth your time.  I would recommend you buy or rent that movie as well.",1393804800,7,2121,4.221945137157107
3498211,5,B001BSBBDA,"I got the black and white Millenium Edition which is better than any ""improved"" color version since it captures the original flavor of the movie and of the time it was made.

This movie rates five stars because of its artistic and historical value as one of the first major zombie movies.  It is also a good nostalgia film for those who remember the 1960s.  There is no need to go into the plot involving zombies attacking humans as it hardly makes any difference and probably has been copied many times.

What is more interesting is the political aspect of this film.  This film was made in 1968 which is around the time when it became all but mandatory in Hollywood to depict blacks as heroes and whites as villains.  This was an early example of political correctness before the term was coined.

The movie takes place in rural western Pennsylvania which even today is mostly white.  Nevertheless a black man appears out of nowhere to save the beleaguered whites in a farmhouse being attacked by zombies.  He knows exactly what to do in a zombie attack and calmly takes charge of the whole operation while the whites can best be described as hysterical.  The main female is catatonic.

The main villain turns out to be a middle-aged white guy in the farmhouse which shows that nothing has changed in over 40 years.  This man is cowardly, self-centered, and devious.  The black man eventually has to beat him up and later shoots him dead, all apparently satisfying a Hollywood fantasy.

At the very end the director has a white posse mistake the black man for a zombie and kill him, with the director showing some restraint since the killing is accidental.  Nevertheless this movie is well worth watching for its artistic and political qualities.",1381708800,,1748,4.703947368421052

3498216,3,B001BSBBDA,"First of all, I openly confess I'm not a fan of colorized movies, even less if they're somewhat ""classical"", as this is in the horror genre.

But even if you concur with me, you still have the B&W original version on the side, so it's not so great a loss.

What made me sorry of buying it is that (and it's not the firs time it happens) the product description clearly states ""subtitled in English"". I'm perfectly fluent in English but it's not my mother language, now I've become hard of hearing, and there are some actors I can't understand for the life of me what they're saying, so captions or subtitles are important to me.

If you need them like me, avoid this version, it hasn't any, notwithstanding the product description.",1342396800,3,731,4.5227272727272725
3498217,4,B001BSBBDA,"I have seen this excellent movie about 5 times (in B&W Laserdisc) in the past. I am very happy with this color version (I will watch the the B&W portion next year). After I noticed the colored automobile, I became engrossed in the story and I didn't notice the color much thereafter.

This reissue is obviously better than tape or Laserdisc. If you have not upgraded to DVD yet, this is the version I would choose.

Note that this the only ""Living Dead"" Type Movie I possess.",1281744000,4,475,4.448275862068965
3498218,1,B001BSBBDA,"Three things:

1:  The ""new"" footage is obviously and distractingly modern.  It simply does not fit with the actual footage.  The beard on the priest is a very modern cut.  A detail like that should never have gotten past the director of the ""new"" footage.

2:  The ""actors"" in the new footage are astoundingly bad.

3:  The score is horrible.  It lacks the tension of the original music.

Russo should be ashamed of himself.",1256947200,6,425,4.608108108108108

After maybe 15 minutes of watching the b/w version, II was totally bored... the fact being I have seen that version so many times.... So I started watching the colorized version... I couldn't believe how different it was to watch... I wasn't bored at all.... It was like me watching the movie for the 1st time... the only thing different was it being in color... I'm still going to watch the b/w version because it is a tru-classic.... After watching the colorized version a few times...

8284507,3,B001BSBBDA,"Night of the Living Dead, 1990 film

""They're coming to get you, Barbara"" starts this movie. They drive to a cemetery to visit their Mother's grave. An old man walks toward them, then another man attacks Barbara, who defends herself. Strange men try to get in her car! She runs away screaming. She sees a farmhouse and runs toward it. Its front door is locked, nobody at home. Stuffed animal heads adorn the walls. Something falls from the second floor! A pickup truck arrives with a man wearing a suit. Any shotguns or rifles inside? The man pushes a zombie out the door. Barbara uses a steel rod against another zombie. [Is there an explanation for these anomalies? If its not nuclear tests then it could be Global Warming!] Can the zombies be stopped? Can you kill the dead? They must stay in the farmhouse until help arrives. [No telephone service?]

Night falls. They have electricity. The radio has ""trash talk"", people who talk as if they know something when they don't. Ben and Barbara take out the trash, then talk about what happened. Only a shot to the head will stop them. Ben finds ammunition, there must be guns in the house. Ben finds one (the previous owner has no need for it). They find other refugees in the house. The truck is out of gas, is there gas kept in the shed? Should they hide in the cellar? Ben says no. They learn what happened earlier. There are personal conflicts. Ben orders boards nailed over the glass windows for protection. Barbara sees more zombies approaching the house. The activities provide shocking surprises! The television tells of an emergency. Will Cooper cooperate? Can they work together? A zombie tries to break in, but is stopped. Barbara shows her marksmanship skills! She gets more bullets. Cooper hears the TV broadcast news.

What is causing people to act like that? What if the recently dead should come back to life? Is it a widespread virus? Judgment Day? There is more personal conflict inside. Can they find the truck keys? Yes, but they need gas for the truck. More zombies gather around the house, a flaming torch keeps them away. The gas pump explodes and the truck burns. No escape now. Ben fights his way back. Cooper fights with Barbara for the rifle! What happened to Sarah? Can Barbara get help? Zombies break on through to the inside! Is there no escape? What will happen when they run out of bullets? The morning brings help, armed men and a helicopter. The zombies are disposed of, then place on a huge pile. They find one in the cellar. Barbara gets the last one! She watches the burning pyre. What is she thinking now?

The original 1968 monochrome movie was a low budget production from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania that was a surprise hit in the spring of that year. It resonated with the audience somehow. This is a copy that has some changes from the original story. Was it better? The original was more restrained, perhaps due to the censorship of that era. The story didn't offer an explanation for its impossible premise. What happened in the other parts of the country, such as urban areas? Will they ever offer a third version? Not if there is no paying audience. Does this uprising symbolize the threat from the huge debts of the past? They can't be ended with a well-aimed rifle shot. You may like this movie more if you never saw the original, which was also average.",1482278400,,3349,4.642495784148398
