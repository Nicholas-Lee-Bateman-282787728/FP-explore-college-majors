1. If You Can't Dance
2. Who Do You Think You Are?
3. Say You'll Be There
4. Step to Me
5. Naked
6. 2 Become 1
7. Spice Up Your Life

Sadly this DVD excludes the songs:
1. Something Kinda Funny
2. Saturday Night Divas
3. Stop
4. Too Much
5. Love Thing
6. Mama

However, Something Kinda Funny, Love Thing, and Mama though not videos can be heard on their CD Single Stop.
Even Though it's the shortened Set list, I will say this again it is worth it.  It'll add a little bit of Spice to your collection!",1235865600,12,697,4.036231884057971

I was hooked and that's because it was my first spice experience. There are not a lot of people that can say the reason they really love a musician or performer is because of their live show but that is what exactly drew me into the spice girls. The level of musicality and performance of this concert is brilliant. Beautiful music arrangements as well and the intro is just sick!!! This is what a CONCERT should look and sound like. I recommend this dvd to any SPICE FANS and people with an appreciation for REAL music.

I remember i was 9 the first time i watched this, and I have the exact same reaction now. Definitely a MUST BUY for any Spice Girls fan. Long Live Posh!",1290988800,,1189,4.790243902439024
3005386,5,B000XSKDTM,"Back when this was first shown on HBO or Showtime in about 97 or so, I sort of thought the Spice Girls were a bit teeny and not to be taken seriously.  At the time, my son was about 8 or 9... and I had bought him their first album for Easter just because I knew it was popular (not all that aware that it was so significantly more a girl thing than a boy thing).  Now, personally, I have always been a big hard rock and metal fan, but growing up in the 80s I also had a healthy appreciation for pop music.  So, anyway, I bought him their CD and one day this was on HBO or Showtime he had it on downstairs and I was upstairs doing some project and had turned it on as background music.  I watched the little documentary that starts this and found myself relating to these girls who were really nervous about their first show (being that I am very raw musician who had only played to small groups of friends in my life).  Anyway, it was cool and once the concert portion started I was like... ""HOLY COW... this is like the female pop version of KISS"".  I dropped what I was working on and sat on my bed and watched the whole thing.  Big stage, outfits, personas, pyro, lights.  Given my tastes for a stage show and good catchy music, there was literally nothing not to like here.  I could not have been more impressed with the girls (not to mention, what guy who was around 28 at the time wouldn't have found at least Posh and Ginger hot?).  The next day I borrowed his Spice CD and took it to work.  After work I went and bought the Spice World CD... and so on and so on.  I am actually proud as a now 41 year old guy to say that I realized the Spice Girls totally rocked... and I was not going to listen to what the general public thought of them.  To this day I list the Spice Girls among my all time favorite bands.  I saw them with my son and 15,000 screaming girls and moms when they toured the US late in the 90s (sadly without Ginger) and again on their reunion tour a couple years ago... where I went by myself (no one else wanted to or was able to go) and I felt a little out of place among the crowd given my age and gender BUT I loved the show.  Anyway, the Spice Girls were so much better than they ever got credit for.  Great vocal harmonies and ideas and just plain fun over the top of some really cool funky 70s vibe musical base.  As far as I am concerned the Spice Girls were a big reason why the 90s broke out of the dreariness of the music that defined the middle of that decade.  They helped pop and rock music moved back into being more fun and melodic again.

As for this DVD, I also own the VHS version, but who wants to watch a VHS anymore?  I had been looking for DVDs of these for years and was glad to find them.  This is a really good version of the same thing you would have had on the VHS.  I was a little concerned that it might be a cheap bootleg or not work on an American player, but it all worked just fine.  Picture is very good, sound is very good.  Very happy to have it on DVD.  I bought the Wembly one as well... and it is also great.

In a perfect world the Spice Girls would have been appreciated more... it is too bad they weren't.  If you give them a chance, I think they could go toe to toe with any other female pop artist or group in history.  I tell you I have seen hundreds of live shows from the best bands out there and the Spice Girls live (especially on their reunion tour) were as good as all the best I have ever seen.",1281398400,8,3472,3.9855282199710564

8229381,4,B000XSKDTM,"The DVD which I received played flawlessly, received promptly.  I had owned the VHS version of this concert, and the disc contains all the features.  The image quality, to my memory, is not better than the VHS (which I no longer have).  I assume it was a direct transfer, not a remaster.  But it is a very good transfer.

I don't have any other concerts, but of clips which I have seen on YouTube and others, this appears to be the best concert DVD the Spice Girls made.  A good purchase for a fan or collector.",1376611200,,511,4.270833333333333
8229382,5,B000XSKDTM,"I wore out my VHS tape, so I was glad to find this on DVD.  Amazon is the best and only place to find ""No longer on sale"" items.  They always have it in stock!",1373760000,,159,3.5142857142857142
8229383,4,B000XSKDTM,I had this concert on VHS when I was little and now I'm just upgrading to the DVD. I wish it was the full show that was aired on TV but its better than nothing and I like the girls talk part.,1371772800,,191,3.5714285714285716
8229384,5,B000XSKDTM,I'm a fan of Spice Girls and I'm so glad I found this concert on DVD. Granted the concert itself is a little on the short side but I think it's on of their better and fun concerts. The interviews and practices are a nice inside look at what they go through but I love this because of the songs... Classic Spice Girls,1370908800,,316,4.031746031746032
