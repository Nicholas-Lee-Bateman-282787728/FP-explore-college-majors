8361055,5,B002BEXF8M,"Excellent DVD!  Much welcomed upgrade from the CD/DVD edition where the concert contained these graphics that made it nearly unwatchable.  Fortunately, this edition makes the graphics optional!  Very happy with this DVD.  I'm only sorry it took Charly all this time to do it right!",1463097600,3,281,5.177777777777778
