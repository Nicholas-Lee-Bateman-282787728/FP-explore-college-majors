8622637,5,B00GFTGSV0,"I loved the original show and am disappointed that they've never made Blu Rays of it, but was lucky to come across this.  The animation hews close to the original in style but new techniques make it pop more.  It's great to see the story continued.",1489190400,,248,4.369565217391305
8622638,5,B00GFTGSV0,"Haven't watched it all yet but I'm really impressed by the quality so far. Animation is improved but still keeps with the original design look. Voice acting feels solid during the first few episodes I saw.

As for the blu-ray quality, it looks quite beautiful. Didn't notice any problems in video or audio. Also, this played fine on my US LG BD player. Haven't tested on the PS4, but a friend of mine who does own a PS4 Slim said it played fine for him. Looks like the set is region-free.",1487721600,,488,4.362637362637362

8622640,5,B00GFTGSV0,"Thirty years after the first season of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mysterious-Cities-of-Gold/dp/B001QKB2XC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mysterious Cities of Gold</a>&nbsp;aired, the second season finally aired.  For fans of the original like me, it was the end of a long, long wait, but for the main characters it was only a few months since they had amicably parted, the adults: Mendoza, Sancho, and Pedro heading for a well earned retirement in Barcelona funded by the gold that Mendoza alone had had the presence of mind to grab and stash before the City of Gold began collapsing around them, and the children: Esteban, Zia, and Tao flying off to further adventures in the Golden Condor.  Said adventures began at yet another mysterious South American temple they stumbled upon and figured out how to open the secret parts of, in which they discovered a map that supposedly will lead them to additional cities of gold; unfortunately, it is a map they cannot make heads or tails of so they decide to fly the golden condor to Barcelona in order to consult with Mendoza.  Finding that their three adult friends have been robbed of their gold and cast into prison on the orders of Zares, a mysterious hooded figure working for the King of Spain who had arrived too late at the temple the children found the most recent map in, Esteban, Zia, and Tao, launch a bold prison break to free them, and Mendoza rewards their efforts by helping to decipher the map, which ends up indicating that another city of gold can be found in China.  Once again the well adventured six set out in search of another city of gold in the golden condor; what follows are adventures scattered around China as they gradually follow the clues and acquire the necessary pieces to the puzzle.  They make friends and enemies all over China, the most important of which is Ambrosius, an alchemist and inventor of a flying ship, who is also seeking the cities of gold and befriends them after rescuing them from murderous pirates so with his assistance they go forward, with Zares relentlessly following.  The danger and the tension steadily increase as they get ever closer to their goal and their fated face off at the second city of gold, amidst increasing dissension between Esteban and Tao and a Mendoza once more up to something he isn't being completely honest about.  After a number of shocking reveals the season ends with a cliffhanger to be resolved in season 3, which is reportedly already in production.  Again, like the first season, the episodes of this season end with short live action documentary segments, mostly about the places in China the episode is taking place in.  Though it is no longer Japanese, the animation is much improved with a noticeable 3-D look, and the animators did an excellent job of matching the look of the original characters.

Note: The Blu-ray version at least comes with a nice, illustrated series guide booklet that contains some spoilers so don't read it until after you've watched the whole show.

Note: This is the British version (there is no American version for some reason) so you will need something that can play all region DVD's or Blu-rays;  I use and can strongly recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SONY-SX910-Multi-System-Zone-All-Region-Free-DVD-Blu-Ray-Player-100-240V-50-60Hz-World-Wide-Voltage/dp/B00SHTYRCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SONY SX910 Multi System Zone All Region Free DVD Blu-Ray Player - 100~240V 50/60Hz World Wide Voltage</a>.",1466467200,2,3581,5.352313167259786
8622641,3,B00GFTGSV0,"I loved watching the original series as a kid in the mid 80s, so I was excited to discover that a second season exists.  Overall, if you enjoyed the first series, you will most likely enjoy the second; it is still at its heart an adventure serial combining historical and fantasy elements, kind of a kids Indiana Jones.  Just keep in mind that they were released thirty years apart and there are some notable differences between the two.

Unfortunately, the voice acting is perhaps the weakest link here.  It's not that the actors are actually bad, but rather just poorly cast.  For example, the three children actually sounded like children in the first series, but here they sound like adults voicing children to a distracting degree. In particular Esteban, who is voiced by an adult woman and sounds nothing like a thirteen year old boy.  Tao and Mendoza also come to mind in this regard, as neither sounds or speaks even remotely like the original characters.  Obviously, after such a long hiatus, the voice actors were going to be different, but they could have done a much better job of at least trying to find someone similar.  Watching the second season, I never quite got over that it just ""sounded wrong"".

There have also been significant changes to several characters personalities, as well, most notably Mendoza, who is little more than a perpetually angry, scowling, and grumpy jerk in this season.  Zia has a more active role and is less of a damsel in distress this time, which is a welcome change.  Tao somehow turned into a narcissistic little brat that never stops bragging about how wonderful he and his ancestors are.  Esteban's personality is essentially unchanged, despite sounding like a middle-aged woman every time he speaks.  Sancho and Pedro are exactly the same, both in voice and personality, even if their comic relief bits are somewhat too frequent.

Despite its flaws, I found this enjoyable anyway, and look forward to the release of season 3.",1448755200,5,1977,4.845238095238095
8622642,5,B00GFTGSV0,A great 80s cartoon gets a second season here.  Fun to see the characters in new adventures.  The discs are supposed to be Region 2 but they played fine in my Sony Blu-ray player and on my PC.,1446249600,4,192,4.026315789473684
