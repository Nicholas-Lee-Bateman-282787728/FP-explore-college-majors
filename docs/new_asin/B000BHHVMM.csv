2417255,5,B000BHHVMM,"I saw this film at the 2005 Tribeca Film Festival and loved it.  I love documentaries that make you think, and this film makes you think and laugh . . . a lot.  It's a great film to watch with a group and I can't wait for the DVD to come out so I can share it with the boys back home.",1136246400,4,284,3.564516129032258
2417256,5,B000BHHVMM,"I loved this movie.  This movie makes you laugh, makes you think, and you come out of the movie smiling!!!

The filming was done so well.  You'll see what I mean after you watch Blind Man's Beer (one of the areas of competition).

Direction was well done and the narration which was so tongue in cheek was done superbly.

If you purchase this movie, you will definitely be glad you did.",1135728000,4,386,4.380281690140845
2417257,5,B000BHHVMM,"Funniest thing I've seen all year. It's been forever since I sat in a packed audience and everyone laughed that hard. That ain't HYPE, that's facts. The director even did a Q&A and showed a deleted scene that was on the DVD. Hilarious. I thought all the stuff about the guy's lives was great. I know tons of guys like them. It makes you feel like you're hanging out with your friends. If you don't like this movie you probably never went to high school or never had friends or never had a girlfriend and definitely never drank a beer in your life.",1142899200,7,547,4.320388349514563
2417258,1,B000BHHVMM,"No amount of manufactured ""hype"" is going to save this one.  Somoene should have told the filmmaker that trying to make these guys look cool and trying to give them a fluffy human-face buy having them tell us their sobstories about family members dying etc. would be a big, big mistake.  Why not show these guys for what they are?  Instead, we must watch these attempting-to-be-quirky interviews with these guys and it just gets more and more embarrassing for them and in the end, a total bore.",1142726400,4,494,4.655172413793103
2417259,5,B000BHHVMM,"What fun!! Men, beer and 15 events that will make you laugh throughout the entire film. The directing is simply superb. Mr. Perry was able to pick up even the tiniest move by these guys to build up the suspense of each event and to make you laugh even harder. By the end of the film you feel like you know each man personally and if you see them in real life you could just walk up and slap them on the back and say hi. You can really connect to each individual and you actually start pulling for your own person to win the event. It's been a long time since I have been in a theater and had the whole audience laughing throughout the entire film together. The Outdoorsman is definitely a winner! If I could give it more stars I would.",1141084800,5,735,4.111111111111111
2417260,5,B000BHHVMM,"I viewed the trailer on-line this past weekend. I actually had to pause it, almost immediately, because I was laughing too hard. While paused, I noticed on the side of the website that ""The Outdoorsmen"" was set to screen in Tribeca that same evening. Still while paused, and still while laughing, I managed to buy tickets, and then resume watching the trailer, which was hilarious. That night, my friends and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The movie is extremely well done. Don't miss it.",1140566400,8,489,4.903614457831325
2417261,2,B000BHHVMM,"This is more like a reality TV show than an actual film and should have probably been only 20 minutes or so.  Another film which I saw at a festival in Oregon, with the same title ""Outdoorsmen"" about the same group of people, which was made a few years earlier was better because it approached the subject in a non-judgemental way and had an artistic flare to it.  This film treats the subjects as only heroes and thus, we are not given any valuable point of view.  The film is too much about who's going to win and puts too much effort in making that an important element.  The style is too standard with forced backstories etc.  There doesn't seem to be an artistic vision here. In the original ""Outdoorsmen"" by Jonathon Benny, who wins the competitions is not important, its about observing the phenomonon of the group without judgement.  Something this remake unfortunately fails to accomplish because the filmmaker couldn't resist sensationalizing the participants.  Perhaps these filmmakers would have saved themselves the trouble if they had simply watched the original film ""Outdoorsmen"" which was by far a more mature and sophisticated effort.",1140220800,6,1152,4.937823834196891
2417262,1,B000BHHVMM,"I had high hopes, after a few buddies told me about it, and saw it during a screening ... but it turned out to be unfunny, low production value, and just boring, unfortunately. It had its moments, but I hate to say I was happy to see the credits roll ....",1139443200,8,255,4.019607843137255
2417263,5,B000BHHVMM,At first I thought it was another ho-hum documentary. Quickly I realized I was wrong. While I was watching it I actually laughed so hard beer came out my nose. I guess now I have something in common with those guys. Blindman's Beer is the best. You got ultimate fighters acting like little school girls when they can't find their beers. Every guy should have their girl watch this to better understand us. Forget Cosmo.' Watch this dvd.,1139097600,5,436,4.602564102564102
2417264,5,B000BHHVMM,"I made my girlfriend see it with me.  We won tickets on KSMB.  They said it was gonna come back and I hope it does.  I laughed my ass off.  Blind Mans Beer is hilarious.  My girlfriend had to go to the bathroom and almost pi***d in her pants cause she didn't want to walk out of the movie.  I just went to the website and it says the DVD is going to have all these bonus features.  I'll paste it below.  It was so funny, I really can't even explain it.  My girlfriend was even laughing when the guys hurled their beers.  Really great stuff.  Can't wait for the DVD.

2417265,5,B000BHHVMM,A inside peek at male bonding that will have you rolling on the floor with laughter! Men will understand it and Women will have fun watching what men do when they are not around!,1137974400,8,178,4.264705882352941
2417266,5,B000BHHVMM,"Dude.....and dudettes....this film is awesome! It's about these 30-something guys that annually go out in the woods in WA and play a bunch of different games like ""log toss"" or ""hatchet throw"" and the side busting ""blindman's beer"". What's so funny about this ""documentary"" is that beer drinking, or should I say ""chugging"", is involved throughout....which incidentally results in hurling while playing. It's hysterical! A must see film that's like ""Jackass"" times 10 with a group of guys acting like guys.",1137888000,,506,5.2592592592592595
8086753,5,B000BHHVMM,"Great movie about good friends and some excellent games of skill, passion, alcohol tolerance and sheer will to continue drinking!

Was hard to find for a long time, grab your copy now!",1471824000,,184,4.75
8086754,5,B000BHHVMM,Hilarious. This is the 3rd copy I've had to buy because my friends borrow it and I never get it back.,1413158400,,101,3.857142857142857

8086756,5,B000BHHVMM,"I loved this documentary.  I only wish I had seen it when I was younger and healthier.  I would have loved to compete in a contest like this.

You need to have a good sense of humor to enjoy something like this.  If you are the kind of person who enjoys unfunny documentaries, you might not enjoy this one as much as I did.",1328745600,,323,4.0
8086757,5,B000BHHVMM,So what you have here is basically a documentary about a munch of hyper masculine men who go out into the woods and compete against each other as they proceed to get obliterated on beer and then engage in various competitive acts of zaniness and downright debauchery ala Jackass but w/o a lot of the scripting and preplanned prat happenings.  There are at least a couple of scenes where the guys drink to the point of physical illness resulting in a vomitorium...,1327017600,,463,4.646341463414634
8086758,5,B000BHHVMM,"This movie is one of the funniest documentaries I've ever seen. I saw this at the Bside release in Austin and laughed from beginning to end. The SAP developed these pretty normal, yet hilarious characters and watched them go through the most grueling and comical of competitions. From drinking while running through a creek to carrying your partner on your back, the amount of alcohol consumed is absolutely stunning. The final event is, by far, the most impressive. I won't spoil it, but to watch these guys drink so much so quickly is an amazing feat that few could pull off, but everyone should try.

Anyone who went through the typical college experience will absolutely love this film. It reminds us of all our youth and how we should grow up but never old. Great film! Highly recommended!",1157500800,2,794,4.753623188405797
8086759,4,B000BHHVMM,"This movie was hilarious.  Only four stars 'cause I have yet to see it with sound!  I took this with me to the bar and popped it in, hence no sound, the whole bar was in hysterics.  It helped that libations were handy.  I felt compelled to stay longer than anticipated so as not to dissapoint the bar patrons watching and in fits of laughter!  Had a blast and alot of inquiries as to what it was we were watching.  Great job, Scott!!!  all the best, Marisol",1153094400,4,457,4.183908045977011
8086760,5,B000BHHVMM,"I am partial to this movie, as I am the wife of one of the guys in the film.  I was sad to read ""Anders"" review of the film stating that it was bad because of the family aspect of the film, about death and family.  These are real guys living real lives.  It is a funny movie about drinking beer and hanging out with the guys, but it also shows that these guys are real and deal with the same stuff through out life that alot of guys deal with.  I realize that not everyone will like the movie if you are not into drinking and having fun with your friends, but that is what this movie is really about.  Guys and girls will love it and you will laugh really hard.  Ignore the poor ratings of this movie, unless you are a boring person.",1148860800,7,733,3.9863013698630136
