7672785,4,B01C6S187M,"Darling (Lauren Ashley Carter) accepts a job as a house sitter at a residence that has a reputation of being haunted. She quickly begins her descent into hell with twists along the way and a mystery about a room. The chapter titles confirms her descent and voices in her head are classic schizophrenia film reproduction. There are some scratch marks early on ""abyssus abyssum iavocat"" which is ""hell calls hell"" or ""one misstep leads to the next.""

Things take off at about 40 minutes into the film. Until then, there is just build up with visuals that will repeat later in the film. It is a slow descent into madness like we saw in ""The Shining"" except not as entertaining. The film was done in black and white in order to give it a timeless effect. Vehicles in the street were mostly made blurred for the same reason. This is close to being a one man play, and is clearly not a film for everyone, but like ""Eraserhead""  will have its following. Ms. Carter did a bang up job.

7672786,5,B01C6S187M,"Superb outing by Mickey Keating, expertly delivered by Lauren Ashley Carter.  While far from your ""average"" horror or thriller, this movie has its own voice; hearkening back to old classics while conveying a story with a modern, minimalist voice.  I frankly can't see anyone other than Lauren Ashley Carter able to grasp the main character so well, nor anyone other than the brilliant Mickey Keating able to give her such a well-molded frame to perform.

It's disappointing, because the filmmakers are obviously very talented, and the right ingredients for a good story were here. And believe me, there are some truly terrifying sequences embedded in this film. It's just so padded that I had trouble paying attention to the movie.

Micky Keating is a cinematic genius and editor Valerie Krulfeifer keeps you scared s***less with her intense jump cuts and dizzying blurs.

7672791,5,B01C6S187M,"I can see by the reviews that most people don't get this kind of filmmaking. They're better off sticking to mainstream titles you'd find in a discount bin at Walmart.

Though experimental and as indie coffee house as you can get, this film is AMAZING and GORGEOUSLY shot in black and white. The greyscale adds to the creepiness and tension in the story. Lauren Ashley Carter played the part very well, and it was nice to see Sean Young make a cameo appearance.

It's most effective to watch this movie at night with all the lights off. Very aspiring for new-coming filmmakers to study.

The only downfall, if any, is the use of strobe lights. I personally don't care for that in movies, but it's very minimal. Otherwise, I highly recommend this film for grind house horror buffs.",1468540800,,779,4.630434782608695

7672793,4,B01C6S187M,"YMMV!!!!

Old school black and white low budget horror. It is not for everyone! I watched this with my husband, who is already not a big horror fan. He hated this movie. The hated the slow pacing, he hated the loose/barely there plot, he hated the ambiguity in it. All the things he hated, I thoroughly enjoyed about it.

Some of the tropes in this movie are ones I personally find very scary. Without spoiling anything, there is a scene where someone is trying to come through a bed room door and the woman is trying to keep them out. It is a brutal and intense struggle that goes on and on and it absolutely terrified me.

So I found this movie scary and starling. It doesn't rely too heavily on jump scares, but there are some so be warned. Ultimately I liked how it played with reality and the actress in the main role is captivating, her face an expressive window into the character's mind.

If you like slow, psychological horror then you might like this. It's thoughtful, cerebral, and elegantly shot. But it's not going to be for everyone.

My only criticisms are that the music can be quite, QUITE, overpowering at times (though it does add to the sense of unease) and that Sean Young, who is onscreen only very briefly, still manages to be absolutely terrible in even that short amount of time- melodramatic, stilted, and unnatural to the max.",1468368000,2,1353,4.528688524590164

7672799,1,B01C6S187M,"I was really excited to watch this film after seeing the trailer as it reminded me of one of my favorites-Repulsion. I am a huge fan of horror films. Lately, there aren't many that are worth watching, and sad to say this one is no exception. I know it is an Indie film and the budget was limited, but what erked me to no end, was they completely goofed with the time period. It looks as if they are aiming for the 50s but I cant be sure. Every time she is outside of the house and walking or sitting in a cafe, you see modern day cars driving around. Very distracting for the viewers and super sloppy for the film makers. It could have easily been corrected and it made me feel the film makers thought us as dim witted people who wouldnt notice. UGH! That was something I could not get past in the film and could barely focus on anything else. Also the story itself is so vague...they had a good idea and screwed it up royally.

Lauren Ashley Carter is definitely a very talented, young woman, but she may need a new agent who can land her movies that are more deserving of her talent.

Waiting for something to make sense, waiting for something to happen, waiting for an explanation for one of the many things that were never clearly defined. It was a total waste of time in my view. Just a truly sucky film disguised as a ""deep"" art film. On top of that, the violent scene was very drawn out to where it was extremely disturbing and not in a ""fun horror movie"" kind of way. It felt very real and I don't mean that as a compliment. You do not want to feel like you are actually watching someone get murdered in a film (unless you're a whackjob).

7672811,4,B01C6S187M,"Darling tells the story of a young woman in presumably the 60's taking care of a large, lush mansion with a dark history. The owner warned her that the last caretaker killed herself, but she soldiers on, slowly going mad. It's a bit like Lords of Salem: very light on plot and heavy on visual style. The entire movie is filmed in black and white without a whole lot of dialog. Darling is our otherwise nameless protagonist, portrayed brilliantly by Lauren Ashley Carter. It's clear that she's a bit disturbed when she arrives at the house with a perfectly bland facade and it cracks spectacularly as the film goes one. Much of the film is driven by odd camera angles, closeups, unsettling flashes of images, and Carter's expressive face. The camera slowly follows her as she walks the streets of the city as her mental faculties deteriorate and she chooses her target. The sense of unease is enhanced by the varying score accompanying the film by Giona Ostinelli. One moment, the music is a beautiful, conventional piano score and the next it practically assaults the ears. This film isn't perfect, but it's an unsettling, beautiful, gory piece of art. The only drawback is that it is excruciatingly slow (which I didn't mind) and some of her faces made me laugh during the crazy moments. I recommend that anyone watch the film at least once whether you find it boring or slow because it's so visually striking and truly does take you on a trip to madness.",1461715200,,1456,4.69140625

7672813,5,B01C6S187M,"This movie was gorgeous and twisted. The movie owed a lot to Kubrick's the Shining, but was a lot more efficient and with an incredibly slick modern-retro vibe. Carter played her role perfectly, and seemed completely natural with swaying into full-bore madness with an elevated degree of viciousness.

The settings, lighting, sounds, sparse dialogue, and overall mood were very nicely done. There wasn't much of a plot, but the movie is less than 90 minutes long so there really isn't much of a need for one. This looked and felt like a nostalgia-piece done up with a feral overtone and more derangement and gore than one would originally presume. Very nicely done, indeed.",1461369600,5,673,4.95575221238938
7672814,2,B01C6S187M,"Couldn't Buy it......

First off, this film is beautifully and artfully shot: the lighting, and the wonderful shots of New York City, in particular never looked better (even more so than Woody Allen's famous, yet overrated opening of ""Manhattan""). Obviously, the makers of the film know their craft technically, and that has to be applauded. However, the overall end product seemed to be lacking in many crucial areas for me. The film makes no apologies for borrowing (I use that word kindly) from early Polanski's ""Apartment Trilogy"" in mood, style, and story. Anybody who has been schooled in these films (or ANY ""female losing her grip on reality"" film, i.e. Carnival of Souls, etc.) may even consider this effort as borderline- cinematic plagiarism.

I could have forgiven that if the film had something authentic, unique, or timely to say about its themes of isolation, sexual repression, mental disassociation, urban alienation, neuroses, imminent psychosis, etc.al- but it clearly doesn't. The film is an exercise in style and little else. Its as if the filmmaker has no insight into the pathology of it's lead character, but uses the concept of descent into madness coupled with The Shinings blurred fusion between paranoia about supernatural potentiality as an excuse to make a visually compelling, retro-style nod to the aforementioned films of yore. House of the Devil succeeded beautifully at this, but I attribute this largely to the fact that it served primarily as a loving tribute, capturing perfectly a time and place that was the golden age of low-budget American horror cinema- but still maintains it's own original voice and avoids a pretentious execution. It also profited from the likability, naturalism, and relatability of its main character (the loveable presence of mumblecore fave Greta Gerwig didn't hurt either.)

Comparatively, ""Darling's"" lead actress Carter was quite simply, unconvincing and flat. In her defense, roles like this are very difficult to pull off, as it must be very challenging to switch on and off into the mind of a character who is, well, out of her mind. But my complaints go beyond merely her lacking a convincing, organic embodiment of her character. Her amateur performance was distracting to watch for me-I couldn't help but imagining her during each take, delivering the exact direction from the film's helmer in a ""step-by-step"" methodical manner, (literally, it seemed like she walking an invisible tightrope the whole time, as if the director was trying to keep her within a certain lighting scheme or for blocking) -but not for character, but for shot construction. Her movements were repeatedly stilted and forced. She also lacked nuance and pathos. I did not for one minute buy that this character had anything ""broken"" or dissociative about her relationship with her environment. She came across just as tame, shallow, and pedestrian (with, dare I say, a hint of arrogance?). I am not sure if this was reinforced by negligence on the part of the director, or just lack of insight or intuition on Carter's part. Its hard to say. It's the classic ""The film doesn't care, so why should we?"" scenario I suppose.

I hate to sound harsh, Carter was lovely to look at, Audrey Hepburn sensibility and all, but her wooden and one-dimensional presence did not communicate ""madness, disassociation, psychotic, ethereal"" or any other effect the director was obviously going for. (I understand that people may argue that this was the intention of the director; but still, there are basic rules of acting that are imperative and fundamental no matter how ""out of touch with reality"" a character is written). Case in point: when she was brutally slaughtering the male stranger she brings home, the way she delivered her lines and her facial expressions were like watching a bad audition. It all just rang so false to me.

I strongly encourage viewers to go back and watch Catherine Deneuve in ""Repulsion"", Candace Hilligoss in ""Carnival of Souls"", or more recently Angela Bettis in the insanely underrated ""May"" and tell me that you don't admit that there is undeniably a stark contrast in caliber of the performances from those gems and Carter's performance here. Even though these aforementioned actresses were also playing characters that are out of their minds, severely unstable, and difficult to identify with on a rational level as detached viewer, there was still subtlety, craft, and some form of character arc present in those films. ""Darling"" and it's lead actress, completely lack these essential ingredients that made those films so enduring and effective.

It's really too bad, because with a more suitable and compelling performance, ""Darling"" could have been a much better film.

PS: I want to clarify that my deconstruction of Carter's performance or presence (as harsh as it sounded) is not meant to presuppose that she has no career, commercially successful or otherwise, in acting. Many great actors have taken roles that simply didn't work for the film, and not because of lack of ability or talent-but for other variables out of their control such as poor casting choices, direction, bad timing, etc.",1461110400,,5171,5.1269276393831555

If you want to watch a movie to be entertained, this is not for you. It honestly feels just like someone rented a nice building for a weekend and went in to film without a script. It's ambling.

8752406,3,B01C6S187M,"Mickey Keating will probably be a big deal at some point. I've seen Darling and Carnage Park by him. Both films have an interesting in your face quality applied to different genres. They're movies that know they are movies and don't mind reminding you through jump cuts, title cards, strobe affects and sometimes even audio that is completely off. Keating goes for mood first.

Darling is basically Roman Polanski's Repulsion but more honest. Repulsion pretends to be very high class and arty. Keating goes for wild man jugular behavior. It's a gutsy move as the film at first is presented in classy black and white with very little to distract you from the obvious homage aspects other than vaguely resembling the Shining in plot structure for 5 minutes before changing entirely. The further into the movie you get the more Keating's style comes out. It's an improvement. Keating both tones down and increases the cartoonish nature of the basic Polanski elements. He also knows how to create tension, release it, and ratchet it back up again. Good skills to have as a horror film director. He's mashing it up though with stuff you'd see in heavy metal music videos and French new wave films. It's like when Andrew Zimmern on Bizarre Foods goes to other countries to see weird variations on hamburgers. You want to try it but you know it might end up just being weird.

The movie isn't entirely successful. Sound issues meant to create a vibe and mood sometimes make it impossible to hear what's going on. The film is short and that's good and bad. Good in that the movie never out stays it's welcome but bad in that it never really establishes certain people. The actors do their best but it never quite clicks.

The movie is just the right side of good but not so good that you can really recommend it to non-horror fans. Most people will go into this thinking it's a punk rock version of The Shining and come out with little more. Keating is on to something though.
