2245002,5,B0007UQ24G,"The Canadian version of Newsroom is the best. If you are looking for ascerbic irony, this is the TV series for you.",1368403200,3,115,4.2727272727272725
2245003,5,B0007UQ24G,World class black comedy satire.... Finkleman is a genuine star. HIs selfish values are profound. He also has a cast of brilliant performers... Top class satire,1358553600,4,160,5.1923076923076925
2245004,5,B0007UQ24G,"the writing of this series is amazingly twisted. i'm proud to be Canadian, the more so because of this funny series.",1327795200,3,116,4.571428571428571
2245005,5,B0007UQ24G,"Truly, I don't know why Ken Finkelman isn't as famous as Ricky Gervais.  He is hilarious as George Findlay, self-absorbed and neurotic news director, who's too busy thinking about ratings, bran muffins and his inability to secure a decent parking space to process or care about anthrax and potential nuclear meltdowns.

Although some episodes fell short for me, mainly because I'm not keen on the surreal aspects, in general, I enjoyed the entire series tremendously, and would highly recommend it. It has a stellar cast and crisp, original writing.",1266364800,8,549,5.157303370786517
2245006,3,B0007UQ24G,"This is the third time I've purchased this set and each time it fails to work in my DVD, it must be a defective manufacturing run...so now I have three copies of it, all useless. I absolutely love the rest of the series and consider it to be one of the high points of Canadian Television...but right now I can only review it in terms of it packaging. It comes in a standard sturdy DVD box with a clear crisp graphic on the front with my favorite Newsroom characters all featured, causing me to yearn all the more for the actual program. Not much more to say beyond this except that I'm really a bit ticked off at CBC productions quality control...",1183766400,3,647,4.311475409836065
2245007,5,B0007UQ24G,"I chanced across this series as it was airing on the local PBS affiliate.  Ken Finkleman's George Findlay is a gem, an egomaniac and hypocrite.  The supporting cast is also wonderful.  The writing is sharp.  If you haven't seen it, it's worth checking out.  Favorite episodes include ""The Fifty"" and ""Anchors Away.""",1144368000,8,315,4.980769230769231
8051982,4,B0007UQ24G,What can I say? Part of the collection. Some better than other episodes.,1492992000,,72,4.615384615384615
8051983,1,B0007UQ24G,Like several other people I ordered this in error thinking it was the Jeff Daniels/Aaron Sorkin drama of the same name!! Don't make the same mistake as once it's yours it's yours apparently (no returns) ,1468540800,,203,4.8
8051984,1,B0007UQ24G,This is not the HBO version of Newsroom Season 2 which is excellent. Watched one episode of this Canadian show from 2004??? Not impressed.,1443484800,,138,4.791666666666667
8051985,1,B0007UQ24G,This was not the Newsroom series I was expecting.,1420675200,,49,4.555555555555555
8051986,5,B0007UQ24G,Great,1416182400,,5,5.0
8051987,1,B0007UQ24G,"compares to the Jeff Daniels version, it was totally unbelievable and poorly acted. I think I deserve a refund since I only could watch the very first episode.",1396483200,,159,4.714285714285714
8051988,1,B0007UQ24G,"I was mis-lead into believing that this rubbish was season two of Sorkin's great work of the same name.
This will not happen again. I am equally certain that many other good customers of Amazon feel the same way.",1383955200,2,212,4.461538461538462
8051989,1,B0007UQ24G,"DO NOT let the title confuse you.. this is NOT HBO's ""The Newsroom"". I bought it by accident and was so excited to get it I didn't even look closely to realize my stupidity... I returned it and lost money doing so but wasn't about to keep something so ridiculous.",1383782400,4,263,4.28
8051990,2,B0007UQ24G,"First, I thought this was season two of the Newsroom that just ended that we enjoyed so much.  However, it was the Canadian The Newsroom (same name).  I am hearing impaired and rely on captioning or English subtitles to understand the speech for DVDs, CDs, etc.  This DVD did not have either.  So, I couldn't understand the speech.  I opened the package and tried to get the subtitles on and since there was none, I put it back in the box.  When I contacted the vendor, I received a message that they would not accept returns of any opened packages.  So there you go.  It was probably OK, I just don't know.  It was a pretty expensive ""dud"" for me.",1376956800,4,648,4.333333333333333
8051991,5,B0007UQ24G,This is one of the best TV shows I have ever seen. Aaron Sorkin is brilliant and the cast is perfect.,1376265600,,101,3.857142857142857
