8318327,5,B001LKLKH0,"This is a brilliant European production of my favorite opera, virtually unknown to any audience by  German audiences.  It is the first German Romantic opera, and contain a terrifying scene in Act Two which inspired none other than Richard Wagner, the ultimate German Romantic composer.  You must see the Wolf Glen scene, which is more terrifying in this production than any other production I have ever seen.",1455148800,,408,5.059701492537314
8318328,2,B001LKLKH0,"What were the ""stagers"" thinking? This opera is so dull that it doesn't even qualify as Eurotrash.  Rather, it's one step up from a concert version.  Harnoncourt's third act conducting is so slow  all dramatic tension is missed completely.  What a shame.  The voices are glorious and deserved a better frame for their efforts.  Voices get 5 stars.  The staging zero.",1437004800,2,366,4.901639344262295

Recently I purchased the 1968 (Kozub, Frick, Saunders) Freischutz DVD despite it's dated mono sound.  Although I prefer state of the art sound, this performance is superior (in my opinion) to all other DVDs of Freischutz in all ways except sound.  Even this dated sound is better in some ways than the Zurich DVD below.  For the first time I saw the opera in a conventional staging that made use of film techniques which are true to the libretto.

The Swiss made Freischutz titled ""Hunters Bride"" does not measure up to the above DVD, in my opinion based on viewing on line clips, and is not available in region 1 or 0 NTSC at this time.  German reviews of Hunters Bride are very mixed.

Now the Review of the 1999 Zurich DVD.

NEW DVD BRAND, SAME PERFORMANCE

(IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE SOUND ISSUE HAS BEEN IMPROVED. THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON THE FIRST ISSUE ON TDK)

During the Wolf Glen the sound fades away.  It is possible that Harnoncourt directed the orchestra to fade gradually during the Wolf Glen, but I think it is more likely the result of how the orchestral/vocal balance was mixed. This recording gives a strong sense of the voices and orchestra being in separate venues.  By 1999, most sound engineers were aware of the need to preserve dynamic relationships over time, so the climax comes in the right place.  Compression is not in itself a big problem here.  Siegfried from the Met and a Lohengrin from Bayreuth, have no serious compression issues, or level shifts over time,despite being recorded in 1990.  Zurich seems to have cured their audio problems in 2000, better late than never.  The carlos Kleiber CD is a much better sounding recording, despite it's analog origin.  Although the 1968 vintage DVD is mono, and somewhat distorted, I find it a more pleasing sound in some ways.  Voices seem to blend better and sound less strained to my ears than in Zurich.

NOW FOR WHAT CANNOT BE FIXED:

This is a dark gloomy staging that at first seems to be trying to express something profound.  On repeated viewing what emerges in my opinion is that the characters are trapped in a rigid society that demands conformity.  Max is played as a bookish loner.  So far so good.  Max sings while waist deep in a pit, is this an attempt to suggest that he is halfway to hell?  When Agatha appears in a drab yellow dress with Annchen in a black dress from a halloween party shop, things go down hill.  They are lying on the stage.  When they stand up, there is a crude sex reference involving a rifle.  Only the men are supposed to have guns.  The trio, Agatha, Annchen and Max, is beautifully sung but the stage direction has Annchen walking back and forth, playing with a pair of scissors which I find very distracting.  Malin Hartelius (Annchen) seems ""boxed in"" by the staging.  I have watched all her DVDs, and regardless of what the stage director makes her do, she is able to do something interesting with it , except here and as Adele in the Salzburg production of Fledermaus (another disaster).  In both cases she looks detached.  I can only imagine the clever things she would do with Annchen if the production would allow some humor.  Only Matti Salminen (Casper) gets a little of what he needs to be effective.  In comparison the 1968 DVD with Arleen Saunders(Agatha) and Edith Mathis (Annchen)is vocally even better and staged very convincingly.

To me, the forest is a vital part of this opera along with Rusalka, Hansel und Gretel and Siegfried. There are no trees here, unless of course a sickly green backdrop counts as trees.  Some how this strikes me as much worse than Carson's staging of Rusalka with an indoor pool, instead of a pond in the forest.  At least Carson makes a water reference.

The Wolf Glen is two inclined planes on which the singers, and black clad apparitions, climb up on and slide down.  One redeeming feature is the casting of the bullets using real fire. Otherwise this scene fails badly in light of the 1968 DVD.

In the end I feel that nothing of depth has been expressed in this attempt to put a Brechtian look on this opera.

Vocally this is a wonderful performance, but in my opinion this opera cannot be slowed down this much.  Harnoncourt lets himself go along with the stage director in doing this, giving us more time to look at the ugly staging.  Harnoncourt's ""slow"" is not an ""interesting slow"" such as some of Furtwaengler's performances.  It's just boring.  His conducting in Zurich's 2001 Return of Ulisse is wonderful, as is his Orlando Paladino of 2005, Hartelius really shines in these recordings.  The 1968 DVD conducted by Leopold Ludwig never drags.

Zurich has revived this production, so it still has a following in Europe where people are bored by years of traditional productions.  In my opinion one should first watch and listen to the 1968 DVD.  Historically Freischutz is a valuable opera that follows Beethoven's Fidelio in the development of romantic opera and anticipates Der Fliegende Hollander by Wagner.  As such, a series of DVDs that deconstruct this opera, are not helpful to Americans who have never seen it done as written.",1263859200,11,5131,4.670758928571429
