8181181,4,B00001U0HR,"Also known as ""American Shaolin"", this was one of the first Chow Yun Fat movies I remember seeing, so I may be a bit biased.  In my opinion, this is one of Mr. Chow's under-appreciated movies.  It is a mix of action, comedy, and romance with fantastic elements as well.  I loved the romance and fantastic parts, and the comedy was enjoyable.  If anything, I think much of the action was unnecessary and, at least at the end of the movie, unnecessarily brutal - it didn't fit with the rest of the movie, which is pretty light and involves more kung-fu than gunplay.  It is a beautiful looking movie and it shows off the charisma and versatility of Mr. Chow's acting.  While some reviewers found the multiple endings (or 'false endings' - a comic finale, followed by an action finale followed by a tragic finale followed by... well, you can watch it and judge for yourself) to be a major flaw, I actually found it fascinating and, if you prefer to end the film on a certain note, you can pretty much stop the film at that point and feel perfectly satisfied.  I should warn those not familiar with cantonese movies that, like many of its era, this film contains an extended nostalgic karaoke video styled sequence with the requisite cantonese pop song.  Some directors, like John Woo, work these musical sequences into their films quite smoothly as transitional pieces, but this is one film where they don't try very hard to disguise it.  That being said, I really love this movie, particularly BECAUSE it doesn't feel like a Hollywood feature.",1029542400,,1541,4.656826568265683
8181182,4,B00001U0HR,"I love this film! It has just the right blend of comedy, action and romance. With a little fantasy thrown in. Chow Yun Fat is very good as the somewhat confused CIA agent sent to China to recover a ""treasure"". The main story takes place at a temple with a cute little boy monk among all the adults. The ""treasure"" turns out to be a strange young woman and the two have many adventures on the way to falling in love. A real gem for mature women fans of CYF.

This was a fun and fanciful film.  I agree with another reviewer - Chow looks great and has more range in this film.  Not just the macho mow-um-down man (although there are gun scenes), there is also some comedy and romance.  Since I had never heard of this one I was pleasantly surprised.",985824000,2,747,4.2027972027972025
