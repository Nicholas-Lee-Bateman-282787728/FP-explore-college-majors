8015524,3,B0001OGVV2,"I bought this something like ten years ago. Glad to see it's still available. I'm sending it to a friend with a little kid. It's clips from CLASSIC COMEDY
TEAMS, hosted by---the original TONIGHT SHOW host---Steve Allen.
Includes Amos & Andy; Wheeler & Woolsey; Clark & McCullough; see Stan and Ollie's first pairing; early Three Stooges with straightman Ted Healy;
an uncut version of Abbott & Costello's ""Who's on First?""; Marx Brothers; Hope & Crosby; Burns & Allen; the silent antics of the Keystone Kops; to
early live TV appearances of Martin & Lewis. 110 minutes Color and Black & White

UTOPIA (AKA: ""Atoll K""; ""Escapade""; ""Robinson Crusoeland"") See Stan and Ollie in Their Final Film. Laurel & Hardy inherit a yacht docked in Marseille
and an island in the South Seas, but when they try to sail one to the other, they're shipwrecked on a nameless atoll that rises out of the Pacific. Ac-
companied by chef Antoine, a ""stateless man,"" and Giovanni, a stowaway. Stan and Ollie establish a tropical paradise using Daniel Defoe's Robinson
Crusoe as their guide. Soon, Eden gets its Eve in the form of Ch&eacute;rie Lamour, a vivacious French singer fleeing a failed romance, who brings an unwel-
come note of temptation and competition into their little island fraternity. The 83-minute, B&W, film was shot in France in 1950. A r-e-e-l ""stinker""!

My suggestion is to buy this collection, but skip Martin & Lewis and that---gawd-awful---movie that helped kill Laurel & Hardy.",1437696000,2,1713,5.856
8015525,3,B0001OGVV2,"The Abbott and Costello clips were decent as was the Laurel and Hardy clip ""The Flying Deuces"".  However, the Laurel and Hardy ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" was so juvenile and boring that I only could tolerate watching a small portion of it.  Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis may have been funny 50 years ago, but Lewis' pratfall humor today is a bit much for me to stomach.",1199664000,6,371,4.4411764705882355
