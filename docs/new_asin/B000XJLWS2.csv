8443684,3,B000XJLWS2,This DVD is Brazilian Portuguese and is much like a Baby Einstein video. I was disappointed when we watched it. There is a lot of music with very little words. I am returning all of the others that I bought from the series since we did not open them.,1204588800,,250,4.122448979591836

""My God, what is this?? I can't believe it, my baby is only 9 months and he can watch an entire DVD, full of joy! Even my husband and I sing the songs with him! I recommend these DVD series to every mother. It is a great tool to communicate with our little son. I can't avoid being excited and extremely happy when I see his curious eyes in front of the TV. Not speaking about the concepts he has learnt: now he recognize the clouds, the rain, the birds Isn't it wonderful? Thank you very much, Super Baby Team! You are excellent!""",1198368000,,766,5.719298245614035
