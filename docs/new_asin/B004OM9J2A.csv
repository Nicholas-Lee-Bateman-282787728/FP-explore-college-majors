8437224,1,B004OM9J2A,"I picked it up used for cheap but am still very disappointed in this DVD. Compared to Gordon Eastman's work this is garbage. They fit 8 hunts into a bit over an hour show, with all the setup, intros, and dead critter shots at the end of the hunt there is very little actual hunt footage. And even worse it's like they're making pancakes, they have a recipe and are following it exactly every time so that each segment looks and feels the exact same, from the recycling of footage to the phrases used to describe the hunt and the result. The result feels anything but original and authentic. I was expecting a lot, maybe too much, but was greatly disappointed. Save your money and buy something from Western Hunter or Meat Eater.",1425254400,,728,4.481203007518797
