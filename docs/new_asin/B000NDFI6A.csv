8177028,4,B000NDFI6A,"Another strong entry in the Epoch Cinema series of DOUBLE FEATURE films from 1930's China.  Movies were competing with American, British and German films for popularity, and local product was both lush and yet sometimes underfunded. Crossroads is considered screwball comedy, Daybreak is tragedy. Both have clear English subtitles. The image is about as good as available as many Shanghai studios were bombed in the long war and film negatives destroyed. This disk is the first time a cleaned version of Daybreak is available in the US.

Directors: Shen Xiling (Crossroads), Sun Yu (Daybreak)

CROSSROADS (1937): [116 minutes] This was Yang Bai's breakout film, playing a young instructor at a cotton mill from a bourgeois family.
It stars Dan Zhao and Yang Bai (of the famous ""Spring River Flows East."") Named by Asia Weekly as one of the 100 Best Chinese Films.  It was released a few months after the Japanese invasion.
Crossroads follows four recent graduates: Zhao wants to be a writer but is stuck proofreading; Tang wants to be an artist but is hired to dress windows. Xu has given up hope, while Liu has ""gone north"" to fight the Japanese. Zhao lives in a crowded boardinghouse with an annoying female neighbor. Unbeknownst to each other, the two meet on a bus and a romance develops.

DAYBREAK (1933): [silent] [220 minutes]  As written in the blog ""JBSpins"", Li-li Li's ""revolutionary hooker is certainly a much more attractive radicalizing agent than the clenched-fist factory worker.  The camera absolutely loves her, and just like Ruan, she knew how to milk a death scene for all its worth. ... It is not hard to see why Li was such a Diva of the silent era (in fact, she was once part of a theatrical tandem known as the Four Divas). Her Ling Ling is cute, innocent, and eventually saucy, but nobodys dummy. Despite all the wrongs done to Ling Ling, she is never a mere victim in Daybreak, which is a major reason why it remains such a notable work.

stars  Li-li Li and Zhanfei Gao: Perhaps more than any other director working at that time, Sun Yu consistently sought to portray the working class affected by feudalism and imperialism. In Daybreak, Li plays a villager forced into prostitution in Shanghai, while her lover (Gao) joins the revolutionaries. After she helps him flee the authorities she is sentenced to death by a firing squad, a scene of devastating impact.

These 1930's movies from China are unrelated to the twenty-first century American ""Crossroads"" and ""Daybreak"" rabbit hatcheries.",1354492800,7,2518,4.903529411764706
