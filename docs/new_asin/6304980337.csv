7880305,1,6304980337,"Beware: the picture on the box is a still of Anouk Aimee in Jacques Demy's 1962 ""Lola"". The disc is a transfer of a 1970 film of the same name with Charles Bronson - as, in fact, described in the synopsis below for more careful shoppers than I was in a moment of haste. Even if the Bronson film is the one you want, get a different transfer. This one is blurry and awful in every way, including no menu, let alone any other features. So: a false-advertising image for a woefully substandard (other) product. I chalk this one up to experience - which I pass on to others.",1237766400,13,570,4.238532110091743
7880306,3,6304980337,Charles Bronson in a different sort of role as a 38 year old porn writer who has a loving romance with a 16 year old girl by the name of lola. Of course their love is not meant to be and the viewer sees that. But during the film you get a chance to see Bronson act in a more comedy sense than his usual no nonsense tough guy image and it's a welcome relief. DIfferent type of film for Bronson and it does falter a bit towards the end but it's still a decent attempt.,972086400,7,466,3.8645833333333335
