2545914,3,B000EXZDZK,"Honestly, this movie is more a 3.5 star film but I gave it 3, since it was too frustrating to deserve a 4. I think it does deserved to be watched once, but I don't think there's enough substance in the film to warrant repeated viewings.

The acting is fine, especially the lead. I think nearly all the other reviewers took notice of Aaron Webber's sterling performance of a precocious child dealing with his first crush. This is not a coming-out movie; Emerson is a post-gay child. He doesn't think of his sexuality in terms of labeling - it just so happens that his first crush is a male teacher.

What prevents this film from being brilliant is that it lacks both edge and ending.

Edge - The relationship between Emerson and Don began to become realling interesting when Emerson started a game of cat-and-mouse with his teacher to seduce him. Unfortunately, this begins and ends all too quickly. It seemed rather weird that Don could be so weak-willed with partners, choosing anonymous bathroom stall sex, and yet be so firm and resolute with a boy cruising him. The john that picks up an anxious Emerson at the end is a weak plot device, more painfully comical that true. It's as if the director and screenwriter wanted to end the movie with Emerson's and Don's virtue intact rather than be bold and make a statement.

Ending - By the end of the movie, I don't feel that Emerson has changed or is more self-aware. If anything, he just learns how cruel the world can be and that some adults will view him as a sexual object. Don's return to his partner, suggested in a brief shared scene, seems like a bandage to his plotline.

The film addresses a very controversial subject - the sexual desires of a minor. But, it also shies away from reality and believability in favor of weak accountability. In the hands of an edgier filmmaker, it could have been a more memorable picture.",1197158400,5,1881,4.56973293768546
2545915,4,B000EXZDZK,"WHOLE NEW THING is another fine little film from Canada, utilizing an excellent cast of Canadian actors to present a modern day conundrum about identity in a manner more sensitive than most other films addressing the subject. Director/writer (with actor Daniel MacIvor) Amnon Buchbinder has created a series of characters, seemingly disparate in age and outlook, who each has a problem coping with who they actually are, and with great skill this story interweaves these fascinating people, isolated by the frigid planes of Nova Scotia into a complex puzzle that answers far more questions about identity than is at first apparent.

Emerson (a strong debut for Aaron Webber) is the thirteen-year-old son of environmentalist/post-hippie parents Kaya (Rebecca Jenkins) and Rog (Robert Joy) whose creative look at life has provided home schooling for Emerson, encouraged his gift for writing, but now find that there are gaps in Emerson's education that suggest enrolling him in the local Middle School might mend.  Kaya and Rog are in a stale marriage: each has needs the other can't appreciate.  Emerson enjoys his isolation and is not eager to move into the 'mainstream' by attending school.  Kaya visits the middle school and meets teacher Don Grant (Daniel MacIvor) whom she invites to her home to meet and impress Emerson.  Don is a bright, lovable teacher who has failed in gay relationships, relegating his needs to visits to park restrooms. When Don comes to dinner, Emerson is impressed with Don's acceptance of Emerson's outlook and decides to give the school a chance.

Emerson, long-haired and androgynous in appearance, suffers ridicule at school but finds considerable solace in the classroom atmosphere Don Grant adapts to suit Emerson's intelligent needs. Don is 42 and Emerson is 13 and while they become friends, Emerson develops his first 'crush' on Don. And while this is happening Kaya meets young stud Denny (the always excellent Callum Keith Rennie) and begins an affair. Many moments of electric snaps occur among all of the characters (a matter of whose crisis is more threatening!) and the manner in which each of the confrontations with each character and conjoined demons  occur begin to resolve the seemingly improbable results that alter the growth of each.

Part of the success of a film dealing with such subject matter is the manner in which each of the stories is told.  There is no crude acting out, no pat answers, and no unnecessary 'drama' for drama's sake.  This is a very honest little film that deserves the attention of a wide audience eager to understand the varying motivations of other people.

2545916,3,B000EXZDZK,"This film has an interesting premise, executed in a fashion similar to fellow Canadian director Atom Egoyan, but reads like a premium channel television show. Basically, it presses the envelope and asks a lot of questions before quickly ending without a resolution, hoping you'll tune in next week. (6/10)",1193702400,5,305,5.244897959183674

What happens to people who are raised without conventional social boundaries?  Emerson Thorsen (Aaron Webber) is a thirteen-year-old boy living with his aging hippie parents in rural Nova Scotia.  Even though they clearly love their son,  Roj (Robert Joy) and Kaya (Rebecca Jenkins) often act more like Emerson's pals than his parents (they have the annoying habit of querying him about his burgeoning sexuality).  After years of home schooling, the sensitive, highly gifted Emerson is enrolled in the local middle school where he immediately stands out from the more conventional members of the student body who have no interest in discussing poetry or reading Shakespeare.  Emerson not only has problems relating to the other pupils, but he develops a crush of sorts on his English teacher (Daniel MacIvor, who co-wrote the screenplay), a common enough occurrence, except that Emerson, so long shielded from the societal norms of the outside world, feels no compunction not to act on his feelings, creating complications for everyone involved.

Alternately touching and queasy, ""Whole New Thing"" is a generally sensitive coming-of-age tale that distinguishes itself with its novel setting and its unusual set of characters.  The movie doesn't always feel like it knows where it's going, but that can be as much a recommendation for the film as a criticism of it.  There are times when it seems as if it is going to go completely off the rails - particularly in the marital travails of Roj and Kaya - but it always manages to somehow right itself at the last minute.  Only at the VERY last minute does it fail to do so, succumbing to an ending that is far too abrupt, upbeat and amicable for what has gone before.

The acting is strong, and there is just enough complexity in the characters and storytelling to make us suspect that MacIvor (who has directed a number of films of his own) and writer/director Amnon Buchbinder, should they choose to collaborate again, will do even more sophisticated work in the future.  As it stands, this is a promising early effort for the filmmakers.",1193443200,3,2095,4.97134670487106
2545918,4,B000EXZDZK,"Ah, I love a chance to do a little alliteration in my reviews.

This Canadian film is very entertaining and very well done. The story of a young boy coming to grips (often), with his sexuality is handled with good taste and intelligence. The acting, particularly by Aaron Webber, is subperb. If he's not actually gay, he certainly does a good job of conveying some of what it means to be thirteen and dealing with such issues.

The sub-plot involving Emmerson's mother cheating on his father with a Cylon (inside joke), is less interesting, but still good. Frankly, that could have made for a decent stand-alone movie, but here it somewhat drags focus away from the main plot.

I'd like to see a sequel to this film, which is not something I say every day, especially not in the context of a gay film, most of which follow the checklist of gay movie cliches (ie: character dies, usually through suicide, character gets gay bashed or character gets AIDS).

>>> SPOILER WARNING! <<<

To me the movie also raised up some interesting philosophical/ethical issues. Clearly Emmerson has some erotic desires for his teacher. The fact that he IS Emmerson's teacher would make it very touchy for them to follow-through on those deisres. I tend to have the view that not all sexual contact between adults and minors is harmful, and in the context of this story, I found myself wondering what the consequences might have been had the relationship between Emmerson and his teacher been consumated (beyond all the legal issues, that is).

For those seeking further reading on this issue, I invite you to check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harmful-to-Minors-The-Perils-of-Protecting-Children-from-Sex/dp/1560255161/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harmful to Minors: The Perils of Protecting Children from Sex</a>, which is a very well done book that covers some of this ground.

Either way, I whole-heartedly recommend this delightful film! Oh, and despite the tags... there's no male full-frontal nudity in the movie. We see Emmerson naked from the side, but that's it, so don't get your hopes (or anything else, you pervert), up and buy it for that reason. :P",1187913600,44,2192,5.2457142857142856
2545919,4,B000EXZDZK,"This Canadian movie ""Whole New Thing"" is just not another film about a teen's ""coming of age"" and dealing with the fact that he is gay plus having a terrible crush on one of his teachers.  Although the aforesaid is certainly a part of this marvelously directed and acted ""little"" film. Indeed thirteen year old Emerson is sent out into the cruel world of public middle school after being ""home schooled"" all of his prior life; there he comes to the realization that he is gay and subsequently has one of those life numbing impossible for it to go anywhere teen crushes on his forty something year old teacher while at the same time dealing with the violence, taunts and bullying that comes with being different and looking a little different in a school that is filled with the so-called ""normal"" students.  The aforesaid scenario is definitely  a part of this film; however, it is not, to me, the main focus of the film.  To me, the real story of this film is the maturation of the grown ups that surround the 13 year old Emerson (which are, of course, his parents whose marriage is falling into ruin and the object of his affection, his teacher who is a lonely and very closeted gay man that likes to live dangerously by visiting public ""johns"" for sexual gratification).

As I stated before, this is a marvelously acted (especially by Aaron Webber as Emerson in what I understand is his first film--amazing) and directed film.  The movie also is splendidly filmed--one really can feel the bleakness of the area that it is showing.  (I assume it's Nova Scotia)

The bottom line is that this is a wonderfully intelligent movie that I, as an old fart, could relate to because, to me, it really is about us older folks coming to grips with our lives.",1187827200,42,1749,4.583333333333333

8115602,4,B000EXZDZK,"A very charming movie with an excellent performance by Aaron Webber in the lead role. I think I've seen this about 4 time now, which is not uncommon for a movie I like. It is a story about a very liberal schoolboy who is raised in a very open minded family, who falls for his English teacher. Having been home schooled, being something of a hippy, and being exceptionally intelligent, he doesn't really fit in with his classmates, which causes conflict. The budget is low, so likely not well received by the Hollywood Blockbuster crowd, as an indie film, it is well made and well acted with a good story to tell.

If you like independent film, then you will surely like this movie.",1429920000,,681,4.491935483870968

8115604,3,B000EXZDZK,"This was an eccentric movie in its plot and theme. The themes were presented from a cultural point of view that fits
a population North of the 45th degree latitude.  I have traveled in foreign nations such as Nova Scotia, Iceland, Greenland
and Scandinavian countries: From those cultural points of view, Family saunas in the nude, home schooling, and open experimentation
for youngsters entering puberty are rather common.  Of course, the minor in question during this movie experiences several emotions,
raging hormones, the first crush, as well as encounters with other boys and men before he selects his heterosexual identity.
However, this movie has so many themes (marital problems, male rendezvous, home schooling vs. public school, etc.) with the
result of a cacophony in emotional chaos and rather indiscernible endings.",1376870400,,829,5.369230769230769

8115606,5,B000EXZDZK,"Its a coming of age story for both characters.  Really well done, written, acted, and filmed. Both characters make cringe worthy choices that seem pretty realistic. You can see the concern/anxiety on the teachers face at times from the idea that such a young boy has this kinda crush, not wanting to hurt him, and not believing in his own self worth to be loved so (as his own love life will attest).  The kid is completely believable as are all the characters. A sweet, funny, wish I had had that kinda coming out, coming out story.",1326499200,,533,4.484536082474227

It's all here in this 90 minute Canadian film.  Aaron Webber (Emerson) is delightful as the 13 year old lead in this film.  It's mostly a rather sad dramatic movie, but there are moments of laughter, plenty of angnst from all the characters, and ample twists.  It's about understanding, love and seeing life from another point of view.  It's put together well, and nicely acted.  A movie I would watch again.",1257465600,,640,4.7727272727272725
8115608,4,B000EXZDZK,"I enjoyed this movie. Emerson, the star of show, did steal the spotlight. The plot was fairly conventional. Boy knows he gay and an accomplished writer, goes to public middle school, and falls in love, for no particular reason,  with his closeted gay English teacher. Don, the teacher, is horrified about having this 13-year-old trying to seduce him. Emerson's parents are thoroughly laid back about his sexuality and they are having their own marital difficulties. Emerson is a gifted writer who had been home schooled up to this time is both sophisticated and naive. He discovers that many of his classmates have taken very dim view of him. This is something that should been expected in rural Nova Scotia. The only thing keeping this from five stars is that the situation is somewhat contrived. Emerson's father is a neo-hippy, environmentalist who is trying to make some money with this energy saving gizmos. The father's wife is unfaithful and bored in the marriage and is having a very visible affair with a neighbor. The home is eclectic and cosmopolitan. There really is no resistance to Emerson's sexuality from the family. Don who is having his own difficulties with his former lover is in a terrible situation. He has no romantic feelings for the boy and he is desperately trying to keep his sex life from a not too friendly teachier in the school. I compare this movie with a similar movie, ""Wild Tigers I have Known"" and it is superior to that because the school situation is fully explored, although the main character seems to be more realistic. However, toward the end the movie becomes a ""disease of the week"" melodrama. I thought the ending was terribly unconvincing; at the end, the cast could well have held hands and sang Kumbiya. So four stars it is.",1250208000,,1772,4.80983606557377

It is not a horrible movie, but I would not claim it to be one of my favorite stories about a young man having a crush on his school teacher.  Worth seeing.",1200096000,2,324,4.046875
