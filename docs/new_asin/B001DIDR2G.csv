His ability and kindness and honesty in explaining technical economic ideas and practices and how those affect our lives and our freedoms, makes him one of the great men of our times.",1488585600,,274,4.829787234042553

8293446,5,B001DIDR2G,"Milton Friedman is probably the 20th centuries most successful and impactful economist. His belief in free market capitalism as a primary agent in bettering peoples lives has been proven beyond any reasonable doubt. All one has to do is take a look at the successes of such former socialistic/communistic backwaters as China, Poland, Estonia, Chili, and many more. Once they adopted free market capitalism their people living in poverty declined by hundreds of millions. This improvement continues to this day.

Milton Friedman, it can be argued, thanks to his tireless efforts in promoting free market capitalism around the world got movements started that have changed and vastly improved the world.

This presentation of his work should be shown in every college classroom in America, which of course won't happen since College Faculties are such worhipers of socialism and belittle the overwhelming case that Friedman made.

Highly Recommended !",1368835200,4,949,5.398648648648648
