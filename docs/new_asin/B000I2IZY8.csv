I'm glad I bought the DVD but buyers beware, it's the European PAL system...It only plays on my computer not on the TV.I tried to read more about this particular CD on Amazon but there was not enough information about it before purchase. I was missing a line-up of the songs also. I would have rather bought a ""non-PAL"" system DVD.",1364515200,,483,4.5
