8346581,3,B001VLBDDA,"This movie was very okay.  I didn't love it by any means, but I didn't really hate it either.  I bought this because I love Drake Doremus' work from Like Crazy to today, but I had been wanting to see his first three films he did before Like Crazy.  I was able to find and purchase this one along with Spooner out here on Amazon and this is the first of the two that I have seen.  When watching, I could see some of Doremus' signature style with the intense closeups of characters, and kind of get a sense of how he started out and how he's developed since then, but as a story, this movie was very very slow, and most of the dialogue was weird and didn't make sense.  A lot of the dialogue scenes ended very abruptly or a character was supposed to be too awkward to respond and only really stare back, and I get that he was trying to convey a story with very awkward characters, but it came off just painfully awkward, and not in a good way.  It really took away from the enjoyment of the film for me.  Also, while I know from other films that Michael McDonald is in fact a good actor, I would not have guessed it from this movie.  The only character that actually came off as likable was the trash guy Eduardo.  The character of the teacher seemed painfully awkward and unrelatable, the son came off as just weird and his dialogue didn't sound like anything any elementary school boy would say, and the mother/wife character came off as just off the walls crazy and completely unrelatable.  None of them really felt like real people aside from the main principal character but even he had some times where I had a hard time relating with him.  Overall, I didn't really like this movie aside from just getting a glimpse of Doremus' earliest work, and I will likely not ever put this DVD in again.",1495670400,,1796,4.299703264094956
