7974237,3,B000077DES,"This installment uses interviewees and images from other installments.  Again, Peru is the focus, but there are other countries that are watching their native animals die besides Peru.  What Americans doing to fight all the extinction going on in Florida, for example?
When it comes to pandas and dolphins, that's it if they die.  But I think we can grab some bird eggs, incubate them, and bring them back.
This work makes the point that we Americans play a key role in the Amazon's destruction.  If we didn't use some much oil and timber from South America, the rainforest wouldn't get so depleted.  This work points the finger at us, not just others.
The work says these birds can live for 60 years and need lots of attention.  I bet a whole bunch of potential pet owners don't want to deal with that.  Further, it says they get more aggressive as it matures sexually.  I think human males can relate to that.  It was fine to be kept in the house all day as a baby, but from the teen years onward, we need to be out on the hunt, if you know what I mean.  Why force celibacy on other animals?  Further, though the work never uses the phrase ""birdy suicide,"" it does say these birds can go insane if caged too long.  They pull out their own feathers and peck at their feet.
I feel sad when I hear that humans kill each other over diamonds, but then I think about how beautiful diamonds are and understand their worth.  The same feelings arose for me here.  I don't want to threaten these birds.  However, their plumage is beautiful.  If you like rainbows, then you will like these birds.
This work does say these birds used to live in the Caribben and the American South, but have been hunted down to just a small section of South America.  But I do think this is a recovery effort that we can win.",1189814400,,1798,4.367469879518072
7974238,2,B000077DES,"Rather than focusing on an animal, this focuses on a region and its people.  It shows how a woody area is being wiped out in Ecuador.

This focuses on human interest or self-interest.  Many people could care less about biodiversity, but they care about their pockets and health.  The work says the lumberjacks won't have anything left to cut if they do so this rapidly.  It mentions that a culture would die, but I wish it had said more about language extinction and exactly how customs disappear.  The disappearance of this wet area may have effects on people's far away.  An important note:  they say this forest is where we have found many pharmaceuticals.  We may be wiping out our chance of better medicines.

I wish this had spoken about what the Ecuadorean government is doing on this matter.  This had diverse interviewees showing women and men, the scholarly and the uneducated, North Americans and South Americans.

It kinda made me want to go on an ecotour as well.",1189728000,,976,4.710059171597633
7974239,3,B000077DES,"It's easy to want to save manatees and pandas, they do nothing to humans.  However, I still get afraid when I think of the bear in Alec Baldwin's ""The Edge.""  This work tries to say bears only fight for a reason.  One person smartly says, ""We should neither think of them as monstrous or cuddly.""

This work says grizzlies only live in 6 states and that the last Californian grizzly died in the 1930s.  When I lived in California, I saw warning pictures that said, ""Beware of bears in the area.""  Maybe those weren't grizzlies, but I didn't get the impression that the state doesn't have live bears and only has it on their flag.

I wonder if professional teams and colleges with mascots try to protect real bears.  Do the Chicago Bears protect them?  Does Brown University protect them?  There is a population of men called bears.  Have they tried to save the real animal?

This work says, ""If we can't protect bears, how can we protect ourselves?""  I think too many people think of bears as humans' enemy to understand that logic.  Another person says, ""They are the top of their ecosystem and so their survival says much about the survival of their ecosystem.""  That's good and all, but I'm quite sure American families and individuals who are trying to make ends meet don't see that as their priorities.",1189728000,,1307,4.597402597402597
7974240,3,B000077DES,"Though this work never mentions ""Dumbo,"" it speaks of tensions between humans and circus elephants that may remind you of that animated film.

This work stresses the elephant's uniqueness.  There is almost no animal like it.  No land animal is bigger.  It may have a language which humans may understand one day if they don't destroy them.  The work shows two elephants stroking each other's trunks after not seeing each other for 20 years.  Yes, it was quite touching.

The work shows two researchers who are studying the elephant.  It also says they have gone from millions in number to a few thousand.  Still, I thought their annihilation was downplayed a bit.  They show elephants in shackles and rooms of tusks.  However, there is no showing elephants being shot or abused, etc.  If that violent reality is not shown, some may not realize the importance of trying to say this animal.

I am mindful of all the burdens that India and African nations face.  They are having trouble just empowering their people.  Still, because elephants are either African or Indian, I would have liked to know if those governments are doing anything to save this native animal.  Because it has been the symbol of American Republicans for almost two centuries, I wonder if that party has trie to save or protect them.",1189728000,,1303,4.801801801801802
7974241,4,B000077DES,"I think parents who want their children to see the facts behind fictional accounts like ""Happy Feet"" may want this.  Like that film, this deals with how humans are making things worse for these creatures.
This work asks an excellent question:  ""If humans say they love penguins so much, why have they played a huge role in them becoming endangered?""
I was shocked to learn that these animals have gone from millions to a few thousand since Western intervention.  The work goes on to say no one cause is to blame and the destruction has been ongoing.  It's Old World killers, humans' polluting the oceans, humans' taking the dirt in which the penguins live, global warming, etc.  At one point, scientists put a tracker on a penguin carcass and I have no idea why.  It seems futile to track a dead body, rather than a live one.
The humans here are diverse:  women and men; Latinos and whites; the educated and the uneducated.  The work, like a lot of pro-environmental stuff, tries to bring a ray of hope.  It implies that extinction is not inevitable.  It says some humans are working to keep this species around.",1189728000,,1112,4.627551020408164
