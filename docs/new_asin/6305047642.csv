960778,1,6305047642,"One star simply because that title was a big LIE!!!
Those films were far from ""The Best"" of Chaplin work, since I could not recognize any of the films in the DVD'S.
Very sneacky indeed, since when I checked in the web about the compilation content, there was no details abut the movie titles in them, so unfortunatly I trusted that at least one of the films would be a highlight in Chaplin's filmography...And that wasn't the case!
I AM VERY UNSATISFIED!
Gave it one star, because I can't give a fraction of it.",1384646400,32,511,4.446808510638298
960779,5,6305047642,"This obviously talented and unique man certainly falls in the category of ""one of a kind.""  He is the true poster-child for conveying body language in its purest form.  His flawless antics were dynamic down to the smallest detail.  Thank you, Mr. Chaplin.

Quality of DVDs very good.",1361404800,8,283,4.833333333333333
960780,5,6305047642,"Some may find the grainy quality of Chaplin's early movies to be disappointing.  However, we must look at the time in which they were made.
A year ago when I brought to my family the first Chaplin movie, 9 year old Katie said, ""this will be boring.....there's no talking!!!""  After watching ""The Gold Rush"" she and her 12 year old brother were enchanted!  Since then, they have become ""Charlie"" fans, and the older the film, the better.
The pathos that Charlie brings to ALL his films knows no boundaries.  In our modern day life, it is easy to want the bells and whistles of modern films, BUT the bells and whistles were NOT available 85 years ago!  These movies are priceless, and well worth watching.  And these movies appeal to all, much like Shakespeare's plays appeal to all eho care to learn.",980812800,2,799,4.591549295774648

961001,4,6305047642,"The Best of Charlie Chaplin video.
 Have only watched one of the seven DVDs and I hope
the rest of them have a lot more variety in his comic capers .
I found that his antics are a little monotonous and repetitious .
At the same time , the comedy of the time was excellent but
I think it's a little dated for the 21st Century .",1411948800,,326,3.8656716417910446

961006,5,6305047642,"I love Charlie Chaplin so I love this set. The images and sound are clear enough, considering how long ago these films were made. I was a bit surprised that Modern Times isn't included, seeing as it's definitely one of The Best of Charlie Chaplin, but this set is packed with good, funny, insightful, entertaining Chaplin films.",1386547200,,328,4.771929824561403

7882264,2,6305047642,"I was really disappointed. It happens always when somebody else decides what The best is of someones career, and what to put aside. Chaplin was a genius and for me, not remembering the titles of his best films, I expected to see really the best. Dont waste your money. The DVD doesnt present the best of Chaplin.
My rating is for the poor choice made and titled The best, not for the geniality of Chaplin that created so many unforgettable comedies. Just you have to know the titles to buy really the best of his works. I will make more meticulous research next time, to buy exactly The best.",1477526400,,592,4.440366972477064

7882268,5,6305047642,"I adore silent films. When I was in 6th grade, we were learning about both World Wars and Immigration and we later watched a lot of Charlie Chaplin movies like ""The Gold Rush"", ""The Great Dictator"" and many other films. I got more and more into Charlie Chaplin and I even got to see the biographical movie that had Robert Downey Jr. as the man himself. Not only did RDJ play Chaplin, he also played the tramp. As for this DVD box set, it's fantastic. Nearly all the silent films are incredible. They may be very low quality because most of the movies were from the 1910's but they're still enjoyable.",1444089600,,600,4.414414414414415
