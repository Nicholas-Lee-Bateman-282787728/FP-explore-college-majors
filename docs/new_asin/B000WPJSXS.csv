8225112,2,B000WPJSXS,"This movie begins strong with on location work at a Mexican temple ruin and then moves into a town to show us a fiesta complete with Voleadores, (an ancient Mexican religious ceremony with men ""flying"" from a tall pole).  These scenes are good and worth watching.  After that, the movie slips into standard ""safari to a dangerous place"" mode with most of the expected  menu for that, sand storm, march through the jungles, love triangle,  etc. This is where the film's real weakness shows up and it's a script problem.  Lundigan and Castle are supposed to be our heros, at least I think they are, but each, on more than one occasion radically departs from that.  Castle switches back and forth from plucky heroine to femme fatal using men for her own gain, too often to be likeable, and Lundigan goes from standard hero to the jerk who  gets everyone in trouble by doing the exact opposite of what he is told to do. The second male lead, a Mexican plantation owner,  who is supposed to be an intelligent man, for some reason puts up with these two and lets them get him deeper into trouble the whole time.  The last 15 minutes turns into unintentional humor in the jungle village of the ""lost"" native tribe.  This a public domain print, (mine is the copy from Platinum Disc) so some scenes are washed out in color, others, still rich and good.",1339286400,,1343,4.535269709543568

The movie begins with a view of tropical growth and a Toltec temple. Their calendar had 360 days in a year. It was deserted hundreds of years before the Spanish arrived. A young woman arrives at this site. Kathryn Williams was sent as the photographer. ""Is he always like that?"" There is a fiesta in the streets, everything is closed down for this holiday. There is a rumor about Toltec descendants living towards the south. Robert Burton needs a guide to go there. Kathryn uses a TLR for photography (35mm film didn't have the definition then). The ceremonial dancers are dressed ornately. Men climb to the top of a very tall pole, then slowly descend on ropes, flying through the air. Kathryn asks about those primitive people. They resent any stranger. Juan Cervantes will take them to his plantation. Kathryn tells Robert about this. On the desert they see a mirage. Or is it a ghost? Juan tells a story about a legendary woman in a jungle who leads men to their destruction.

The group travels through the desert lands. Kathryn sees an iguana! A sandstorm threatens them, they take refuge among the rocks. A burro runs away with their water. They travel light to Juan's plantation. White orchids that produce vanilla beans are fertilized by hand. They must travel on foot further south through the jungle. Is there danger? They cross a stream and walk up the hills. Smoke sends a signal. Vampire bats fly by night. The next morning they hear the drums signaling a welcome. Juan says they must continue unarmed, but Robert hides his pistol against orders. Juan sets a trap for deer, but when it goes off it kills the son of the chief! [Those wild Indians wear shoes.] They are taken to the village, which has a stone temple. Dancers put on a show or ceremony.

It ends with a sacrifice! Bob and Juan have a plan to burn off their ropes and free themselves. A fire for distraction, and Kathryn is rescued from the stone altar. More confusion follows. [Believable?] The three run back where they came from, pursued by the wild Indians. Juan stays behind to draw the Indians away and let the others escape. This sacrifice works.

This is a low budget movie, but the story was interesting. Its advantage is being like a travelogue. There is humor in watching this story because it so predictable. The idea that primitive people used human sacrifices to appease the gods seems amusing. Until you realize our modern economy also sacrifices people in hopes of creating prosperity! Have we advance that much?",1301270400,5,2533,4.711060948081264
