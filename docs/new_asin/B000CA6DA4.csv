8325018,5,B000CA6DA4,It would be hard to find live demos as good as these DVDs from Ms Nash. They are perfect for the beginning papermaker or anyone considering taking up the craft.,1392768000,,160,4.366666666666666
8325019,5,B000CA6DA4,"This is a great video workshop for anyone wanting to learn the basics of papermaking, and a little beyond.  While the price might put some off, it would be wise to consider the cost of a live demonstration workshop, and the effort involved in locating one, before ruling out the convenience of this DVD.  Nash is a wonderful teacher who gives clear and simple instructions that anyone should be able to follow with success.  Both Western and modified Japanese methods are demonstrated, and Ms. Nash gives a good deal of time to discussing the process of making pulp from plant sources as well as recyclables. I would definitely recommend this DVD to those looking for a quick and easy way to get started making lovely homemade papers.",1249516800,2,734,4.7637795275590555
8325020,5,B000CA6DA4,"This is a great video for someone who wants to learn to make paper. Catherine Nash is an experienced papermaker and teacher who knows how to communicate her passion for papermaking in a wonderful, clear way. Starting with the basics of making paper from recycled pulp and a kitchen blender, Nash then moves to more sophisticated techniques, explaining everything clearly from beginning to end.  The whole video is packed with a lot of information, enough to keep someone busy for a long time. Technically speaking, the video is well filmed and edited and pleasant to look at. It is done professionally and everything flows well from beginning to end.

What's great is that one can rewind and review the material and move on to the next level when ready. It's like having a private tutor in your own home, whenever you are ready to learn.

As a papermaker myself, I have found this video to be a wonderful reference guide and I learned a lot by watching it. It helps me structure the papermaking workshops I give from time to time. It's well worth the money and I can't wait for volume II to come out!",1146268800,5,1100,4.6020408163265305
