8291272,5,B000YNF4R2,"Some years have passed since I first read the story of this wonderful man in William Blum's book 'Rogue State'. A book that led me to so many historic events which were opposite to what the media and it's puppeteers were telling us.
He was the predecessor to Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, Lula of Brazil, Evo Morales of Bolivia, the Kirchners of Argentina and other new leaders of Latin America who are looking after their own economies without being indebted to the IMF or World Bank, who with their crippling interest rates have broken the lives of citizens and bankrupted entire countries, ie Spain, Ireland and Greece.
This documentary I found enlightening and I was most impressed to see so much original footage. Anyone who truly wants to reach back into the history of Latin America should read 'Open Veins of Latin America'; this along with Neruda's poems are the only books Isabel Allende, niece of Salvador took with her wrapped in her baby's nappies, in the one suitcase she was allowed to escape with that terrifying day when her uncle died - 11th of September 1973 [9/11/73]
The DVD arrived safely and was well wrapped as have been all the books and DVDs I have bought from amazon.",1360886400,7,1190,4.698564593301436

8291274,5,B000YNF4R2,"Patricio Guzman, Chile's poet-documentarian, remains haunted and riveted by what happened in his country during the revolutionary years of Salvador Allende's administration and the US-backed fascist coup which ended it. Guzman has been chronicling the Chilean Revolution and its tragic end since the beginning, having made the best documentary on the subject, ""The Battle Of Chile"" which ranks with the great political films like ""The Battle Of Algiers"" and ""Z."" With ""Salvador Allende"" Guzman produces both a detailed, sharp portrait of a key Latin American icon and a haunting reflection on memory, exile and the passage of time.

Guzman's film begins with the remaining objects which belonged to Allende, his hands search through a wallet and we see behind museum glass Allende's fractured glasses, found after the Chilean army's coup plotters bombed the presidential palace. Guzman interviews both exiles who fled the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship which followed Allende's downfall and artists and poets who bravely stayed in Chile, refusing to forget. These are powerful moments with universal relevance on leaving one's home, feeling time pass and things change, and the pain of memories full of both hope and tragedy. Guzman then embarks on chronicling Allende's life which was naturally pulled into the greater arena of recent Chilean history. Mixing rare footage of the man himself, rare photos and epic shots from ""The Battle Of Chile,"" Guzman forms the portrait of a brilliant politician with a powerful utopian vision. One realizes how heroic Allende's vision truly was, especially as it found itself caught between US imperialism's obsession with smashing it and a growing culture of armed insurgency in the region, seeing the Cuban Revolution as its guiding light, which questioned whether radical socialist change could truly be carried out according to the rules of traditional, Western democracy.

As the film states, the Pinochet dictatorship's obsession with erasing the memory of the Chilean Revolution was so deep and brutal, that there isn't even a serious written biography of Allende available (although Ocean Press has produced an excellent collection of his speeches). But Guzman's film fills the void brilliantly. He doesn't fall into the usual temptation to over-glorify his subject, he is obviously sympathetic to Allende but this is a serious effort at profiling a man and his times. Friends and colleagues honestly share their admiration and criticisms, in one memorable scene a group of former Chilean militants debate around a dinner table whether Allende's socialist program was misguided or truly revolutionary. In the US, for those who ever bother to read on the topic, Allende is usually presented as a Marxist revolutionary in the tradition of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, and while Allende was indeed a friend of both men (Castro visited Chile for 27 days to witness the democratic road to socialism himself), he was not a dogmatic follower of the then-popular Leninist tradition. An old colleague and others who knew him reveal information previously unknown, such as the fact that Allende was more of an admirer of the French Revolution, and his first real introduction to revolutionary politics was through an anarchist shoemaker in his boyhood. A clearer picture forms, you realize there's good reason to suspect Allende was trying to produce some sort of original, improvised form of libertarian socialism in Chile. The former US Ambassador to Chile is interviewed, he openly discusses how for the Nixon administration, Allende's brand of socialism was even more threatening than Cuba's because of its democratic, international implications. We get a lesson in the gangsterism of politics as the ambassador discusses CIA plans to smash Chile's economy and even carry out assassinations to prevent Allende from even assuming office.

The beauty of Guzman's style is that he doesn't just make a straight forward documentary, in the interviews and subject he mines for deeper, universal and personal themes. Allende is the main topic, but the film has a wider vision. Guzman is searching for memories, for experiences. His subjects don't just talk about Allende, they share the feeling of people who experienced a unique, life-changing moment in both national and individual terms. Guzman also holds shots to show us details in faces as we see the bitterness of defeat, the sadness of having seen a utopian moment crushed by a fascist whirlwind. Guzman's narration at times swerves away from narrating Allende's life and journeys into passages of poetry and self-reflection. There is also a boiling anger at the Pinochet regime. In one memorable scene, Guzman walks down the neighborhood where the presidential residence used to reside, he asks the upper class neighbors if they recall the looting which took place of Allende's home during the coup. He is met with silence or shut doors, again we see the power of memory.

""Salvador Allende"" is a powerful documentary that revives a historical figure well-known in Latin America, all but forgotten in the United States where most citizens are not aware of their neighbors, their stories, histories and the threads that connect us. Consider this: The US-backed coup took place on September 11, 1973.",1315267200,16,5290,5.301549463647199
8291275,1,B000YNF4R2,"I have been unable to locate a DVD of Salvador Allende so was very excited to find it on Amazon.  However, as was the case with the previous reviewer, I  could not get the English subtitles to work.  On closer inspection, I figured out that the subtitles mentioned on the DVD package refer to a few brief moments in the film which feature Spanish subtitles to translate English conversation.  Very misleading! And disappointing since I do not speak Spanish.",1228348800,2,457,4.746835443037975

We tried in vain for fifteen minutes to have the English subtitles displayed.  The packaging said the DVD featured a subtitle option but we were unable to get them working.",1208131200,3,306,4.754716981132075
8291277,5,B000YNF4R2,"Salvador Allende remains one of the most fascinating political figures of the late 20th century. Allende made history in 1971 when he became Chile and the world's first elected Marxist leader. Filmmaker Patricio Guzman here tackles this icon of the Left, and even of democracy itself, with a film that is not so much a biography of Allende, but a memory, Guzman's own search into his country's past, his own memories, and how Allende's revolution marked and affected them. No other filmmaker has attempted to tackle the Allende persona, which is a subject that has gained more importance now in an era when Latin America is choosing to elect socialist leaders and revolutionaries like Hugo Chavez use the ballot rather than bullets to take power. ""Salvador Allende"" chronicles Allende's rise to the presidency and the socialist revolution he wanted to bring. Guzman uses images he himself filmed during the Popular Unity years, showing the kind of revolutionary fervor that engulfed a nation. The masses take to the streets, the workers take land, music and laughter fill the air while rich elites scorn and scoff. Guzman makes a point about the class struggles Chile faced, as Allende was attacked by a bourgiouse that was heavily funded by the Nixon White House. A former government official even comments on Nixon's fears of Allende's win, threatening to export terrorism into Chile and strangle the nation's economy. There is a particularly powerful moment when Guzman wanders into a rich neighborhood where the presidential home used to reside. He presents photos of Allende's burned home after it was sacked by local enemies after the notorious September 11, 1973 fascist coup that overthrow the government, replacing it with the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship. Guzman then goes to rich people's homes asking if they remember the looting, nobody but one resident agree to speak. The portrait we form of Salvador Allende is of an intelligent man, a visionary and thinker who wanted to bring revolution through the vote, through the literal will of the people, but was confronted by powerful forces and vicious enemies funded by the United States. As with his previous films, Guzman here tells a story and also goes on a search. He revisits old spots, interviews eyewitnesses and family members, trying to piece together what exactly happened. There is an urgency in the way he is attempting to document the Allende revolution, a moment in Latin American history the Pinochet government tried desperately to erase and hide. ""Salvador Allende"" is not just a film about history, but memory, more than most filmmakers, Guzman has been able to evoke a sense of memory, of remembering, not wanting to forget, and finding out the truth of an event. It is interesting how in many circles Allende is placed on the same pedastal as Che Guevara and Fidel Castro, but yet few serious films have been made about the man and his times. Here Guzman gives us a fascinating document that is also a moving experience.",1196726400,8,3003,5.020040080160321
