7946194,3,B00005N5RU,"Scottish Clans/ Scottish Verse (Ken Gray, 2001)

Have you ever gone to a museum that showed videos? You know the kind I'm talking about-- produced on next to no budget, with frequent reuse or stock footage and extensive narration? That's what these two small pieces are, and as long as you're ready for that, these aren't bad little movies.

And, as expected, stock footage. ** ",1173744000,7,563,4.854166666666667
7946195,1,B00005N5RU,"Very low-budget program. Two actors who are used over and over again, walking, strolling, reflecting, running, sighing, staring, falling down. Repetitive scenery shots abound. Little useful information, and very few clans. Monotonous narrator. Could have been an informational delight. Instead, a static drone.",1140825600,17,310,6.232558139534884
