2015829,3,B0001MMF46,"Well, well, well... The story is interesting but due to the fact that the film was made in 1971 its quality is very poor, very dark and hollow audio sound. Also, the scenes are boring... Sometimes you won't understand what is going on or what's happened. I bought it as another film of Michele Mercier which I like so much, but in this film she does not appear bold, and her role is quite boring.",1185580800,3,396,4.293333333333333
2015830,4,B0001MMF46,"My copy of this flick is from an outstanding 10 DVD (double-sided)Brentwood compilation called ""Nightmares From the Crypt"" which has other cult classics like ""Don't Look In the Basement"", ""Messiah Of Evil"", ""Circus Of Fear"", ""Horror Hotel"", ""Jack the Ripper"" and the like.  This version is 102 minutes & not rated.  I really liked this movie and is one of the most played of this compilation.

Klaus Kinski gives his usual manic, if brief, performance and is quite entertaining (as he usually is).  The filming of the castle is very dark & creepy, which is perfect for a late-nite viewing.  While this is not a gorefest, it is an above-par haunted house story with some kinky subplots interspersed throughout.  The ending sequence where Alan Foster is escaping the vampires who inhabit the castle into the morning light in slow-motion is quite freaky & hilarious.  Me & my buddies got a huge kick out of this one late late night when we watched a huge portion of this compilation enjoying our favorite tobacco.  In the end, Kinski shows up & eerily looks to the sky muttering ""no one will believe this"".

I highly recommend this film for fans of this sub-genre (late 60's/early 70's horror).  I also strongly recommend the Brentwood 10 DVD compilation ""Nightmares From the Crypt"" (see my review on this), because it is the BIGGEST BANG for the buck & highly entertaining!!",1174089600,4,1372,4.8247863247863245
2015831,5,B0001MMF46,"I bought Web Of The Spider at the Dollar Tree on DVD not really knowing anything about this film because I was seeking to watch a horror film fest on Haloween Night 2004. Even though I didn't know anything at about the actors or the film itself it some how pulled me in and said BUY ME ... so I said what the hey and bought it! I am so glad I chose this film because it is very eerie , bone chilling , spooky and awesomely sexy !!! The whole film in itself give you a feeling like you are there in London with Alan the main character and everything he goes through it really seems like you go through . I mean if you like films that give you a spooky , chilling and scared to be alone at home while watching type feeling yet are not pure gore ... well then Web Of The Spider is the film for you. All I can say is awesome script , fantastic camera work and the actors are very , very sexy !!!! This is a 5 star film in my book. Happy Hauntings !!!

2015832,3,B0001MMF46,"The only thing more amusing than a cheap domestic horror flick is an imported variety.  The unwary viewer must accept Klaus Kinski (of all people) as Edgar Allan Poe.  Then we have clean-shaven Tony Franciosa, wearing togs from the 1970s, as the 1840s guy who accepts the inevitable challenge to spend the night in the haunted castle.  You get the idea.  The film is weird rather than scary.  Ghosts abound, but they don't jump out and say, ""Boo!""  The haunting wraiths have other things in mind.  The picture begins to resemble a gothic romance, in places.  At least it tries to be different.  On the plus side, we can award points for effective atmosphere.  The film might be considered as camp entertainment, but we aren't sure that the Italian filmmaker had purposeful satire in mind.  The entertainment is strictly for die-hard fans of schlock horror flicks.  (This reviewer is a master of this type of foolishness).  In that context, it is worth collecting.  Others beware.  ;-)",1067990400,4,984,4.843373493975903
2015833,4,B0001MMF46,"In my review of WEB OF THE SPIDER I noted that ""matters weren't clarified much by the release of Brentwood's CRICUS OF DEATH 4 DVD box set, featuring the exact same video transfer"".
That is INNACURATE, folks; while I did not stopwatch time it or check the run time on my player, the Brentwood Media CIRCUS OF DEATH DVD with THE WEB OF THE SPIDER does contain material that had been excised from the same print used by Timeless Video for this release. They ARE made from equally dismal transfers, and perhaps even the same one, but bits have been sliced out of Timeless' release [i.e. Tony Franciosa wriggling on the bars of the gate after being spiked] that have been clipped off the VHS release ...
Of additional note is that I just noticed Amazon has an ""R"" rating and 94 minutes for their item description [as does the Timeless box], but Brentwood lists it's WEB OF THE SPIDER as ""Not Rated"" and provides a 102 minute running time ... I would then state that this tape is probably best suited for collectors, or those who still haven't figured out the benefits of DVD technology. Worth getting, but it is now documented that there is a better source available.",1054166400,4,1163,4.542857142857143
2015834,5,B0001MMF46,"The plot to Web of Spider sounds a little hokey; a writer/journalist journeys to London to meet and interview Edgar Allan Poe, and he ends up spending a night in a haunted castle.  I understand that this 1972 film is a remake of the black and white classic Castle of Blood, but having not yet seen the first film I can not compare the two.  All I can say is that this is an extraordinarily, genuinely creepy movie.  The inclusion of Edgar Allan Poe (played somewhat questionably by Klaus Kinski) is really quite unnecessary as the adventures at the castle more than stand on their own two feet.  For his part, however, Poe claims that all of his stories are based on true events, and he has a new story in waiting when the American journalist Alan Foster (Tony Franciosa) accepts Lord Blackwood's bet that he cannot spend a full night in his haunted castle.  I won't say much about what happens over the course of this strange night, except to say that it is far from just your typical haunted house story.  The first ten or fifteen minutes of Alan's exploration of the house were really and truly creepy, on a level that had me engaging in my own dialogue with Foster.  I remember saying ""don't go in there"" and ""nothing good will come of this"" several times.  Years of sating my compulsion for horror in all its forms has all but atrophied my ""spooks"" nerve, but this movie dug way down and hit that nerve several times, much to my uncomfortable delight.  I even sort of jumped once, and that is unheard of.
I don't feel the movie was very predictable, either, and that is another reason I enjoyed it so much.  I'm not saying it's difficult to see the ultimate conclusion coming, but I for one was never completely sure how things would play out until the very end.  The Gothic look and feel to the movie is outstanding, really, and the cast (aside from Kinski) is superb.  Michele Mercier is particularly captivating in her role.  I would praise the other cast members one by one, for the effectiveness of this movie is a direct byproduct of their outstanding work, but I really do not want to risk giving away one single thing about the night's events.  If you enjoy old school horror, especially of a richly Gothic variety, Web of the Spider is just what the doctor ordered.  I hesitate to make a claim as bold as this, but, at least for the time being, this is the best, most deliciously creepy haunted house movie I have ever seen.",1052524800,11,2438,4.471783295711061

8014698,4,B0001MMF46,"Garagehouse has done a fantastic job with this.  Super 8mm condensed version of the film, original ITalian with English subtitles, a deleted scene (best nudity from co-star Karin Field), etc.  And TWO (2!) audio commentaries.  The film itself has a dream-like quality that lends itself to watching it late at night.  Not 'spooky' per se (I grew up on this stuff), but definitely worth watching, especially in ALL of its variants.  I wish there were even more 'lost bits' (especially Karin Field or Michele Mercier!).  Previously Blu-Rays from Garagehouse that I bought are 'Trailer Trauma 2' and 'TT 3' which dealt mostly with monsters, and I WILL be buying 'TT4-Television Trauma' in the next week or so.",1514851200,3,705,4.982905982905983
8014699,4,B0001MMF46,"This review is for the Garagehouse Blu-Ray.  I wanted to see this film for two decades because I am a fan of Margheriti, Kinski and the original film (Castle of Blood).  This remake is not as good as Castle of Blood, although it does have merits of its own, e.g. Kinski, higher production values, and often gorgeous photography.

The Blu-Ray is fantastic.  I've watched the english language version, and it looks good for an obscure film.  The picture alternates from segments that appear soft with inconsistent black levels and color, to segments of great clarity and depth.  I'm content.  Sound is fine.

The extras are extensive, and I have only watched some of them, including the first commentary (entertainin) and the deleted scene.  I may watch the extended Italian version at some point.  It is SD but looks quite watchable (far better than the public domain garbage).

Love to see Garagehouse release more European films of this era.",1512259200,3,942,4.89873417721519
8014700,4,B0001MMF46,"One things has to be said for the smaller DVD/Blu-ray releasing companies. They are taking the time and putting the effort into putting out some long lost films in the most gorgeous looking condition that can be found anywhere. When these same films were released on video way back when the worst looking prints were found and a quick buck was made. Now time is being taken and the difference is visible with each new release. Some call it a niche market. I call it a labor of love.

Garagehouse Pictures is just such a company and while their releases come out slowly they are done to perfection. I mentioned a while back their release of the film THE INTRUDER. Now theyve released another film that is worth picking up for fans of horror films, especially those made in Italy.

WEB OF THE SPIDER is a remake of the film CASTLE OF BLODD, the much loved black and white Italian production that starred Barbara Steele. Both films are directed by Antonio Margheriti under the pseudonym Anthony M. Dawson.

The story revolves around a drunken Edgar Allan Poe (Klaus Kinski) telling tales in a bar for drinks while in England. In walks Alan Foster (Anthony Franciosa), a journalist who has been seeking out Poe for an interview. They begin to talk about life, death and what happens after but while Poe believes in ghosts Foster does not. Poe and his friend Thomas Blackwood challenge Foster to put his money where his mouth is and suggest he spend the night in the castle owned by Blackwood.

Foster takes the challenge and the three head to the castle. Hes been told by Blackwood that no one has ever survived an overnight visit to the castle on this night as it is All Hallows Eve. Foster scoffs at the idea of the supernatural and the trio arrive at the gate and the pair leave Foster to fend for himself. He gets through the front gate, walks through a cemetery in front of the estate and finds his way in.

A quick walkthrough of the lower floors, a few passages played on a harpsichord and soon he finds himself face to face with Elisabeth Blackwood (Michele Mercier). She shows him around the estate, talking about things that have happened there. Forster is intrigued by this beautiful woman so much that he begins to fall in love with her.

But as the night moves forward things begin to happen. Where once there were cobwebs and dust there is now a ballroom filled with guests dancing away the night. Elisabeth is now in the arms of her husband as Forster begins to witness the past before his eyes and learns that Elisabeth is not what he thought but just one of many ghosts in the house.

As the night progresses Foster learns of what happened to each of the various apparitions he sees before him. Will he survive the night? Or is there some insidious reason that these wraiths have appeared before him, some need they have for him to continue on with their own survival?

The movie is a classic styled gothic horror film from the setting and costumes to the customs of the time, both past and present in the tale. The sets in use are wonderfully detailed and bring to life the story that unfolds. Not only that were offered the film in a widescreen presentation, something thats been missing for some time.

The acting is above what most would expect in a film with this sort of topic. Franciosa was an underrated actor who should have garnered better roles. Even so he put his all into the roles he had and it shows in this one. Mercier is equally up to the task matching him from their first scenes together to their last. And Peter Carsten as Dr. Carmus, a ghost who was once a visitor like Forster does a great job as well.

Garagehouse Pictures is releasing this in the best version youll ever be likely to find. The film has been fully restored and mastered from an uncut, domestic theatrical negative and it shows. The clear, crisp, clean image on view is amazing. In addition to that the film is loaded with extras that include an audio commentary track with George Reis & Keith Crocker, an audio commentary track by Stephen Romano, 2 German Super 8 movie digests, an Antonio Margheriti trailer reel, deleted scenes, an uncut Italian version of the film (non-high def), an art gallery, a collection of Garagehouse Pictures trailers and it features new artwork by Stephen Romano.

Horror fans will want to add this one to their collections. Fans of Italian horror films will be pleased to finally have this film available in such great shape. It offers a sold evenings worth of entertainment and should please most. This is a great example of how good a movie was being made at the time.",1510185600,12,4605,4.556227327690447
