1878951,5,B000094HMT,"I also saw the broadcast, and I would echo the previous reviews, and add a few points.
First of all, Mattila.  Lord.  What amazed me most of all from this very committed performance is her singing at the END of the opera -- you would have no clue that this woman had just finished one of the most punishing roles in the repertoire.
Re the comments on Heppner:  You know, the singing IS the acting.  It is the unique thrill and excitement of the human voice that brings these characters to life.  There are many more opera singers throughout history who couldn't act half of what Heppner brought to his role, much less fit the supposed physical requirements.  People!  Hello!  If physique were actually important, we would have to throw out as unimportant all the contributions of Pavarotti, Caballe, Eaglen, Voigt, not to mention the greats of other times like Caruso, Gigli ... the list is impossibly long.  Enough said.
Finally, the aforementioned hopefully upcoming DVD of Tristan from the Met would have to be shelved, because the combined weight of the two stars easily tops 600 pounds -- and who the hell cares?  It was the most eagerly anticipated Tristan of a generation, because here were two singers that could really do justice to the demands of the roles.
Bring on Eaglen and Heppner!",1075075200,22,1296,4.72
1878952,5,B000094HMT,"When this Fidelio was broadcast, I actually wrote in to the MET begging them to release it either on DVD or on CD. Now my dreams have come true!! Truly, this is one of the great Fidelios on record not so much for the sets but more for the singing!! The sets are fine. I think they are wonderful but personally I would have preferred the time setting to be during Beethoven's time - early 19th century. But this time setting works as well, simply because of the intensity of the acting and singing. Sometimes, when singers sing intensely, they lose vocal control and everything goes out of pitch of out of tune. Not so here!
Yes, the glory of this set is the singing, the acting, Levine's conducting - in fact everything. Except perhaps the chorus in the finale which doesn't really lift the spirit as it should. but that doesn't really dent the performance. Marzelline and Jacquino are well-cast. Rene Pape shows why Birgit Nilsson thought so highly of him and gave him the first Birgit Nilsson prize. Pizarro is suitably nasty - acting and singing are excellent. Ben Heppner is too well-endowed but his singing and acting is so intense, after a while you are totally immersed in the drama and you don't notice.
However, the greatest glory of this set is the flawless soprano of Karita Mattila!! In the murderous role of Leonore, Mattila triumphs and triumphs magnificently!! Leonore is a notoriously difficult role. The singer is on stage most of the time, and the singing is taxing. From the start, she has to sing a quarter, a trio then an extraordinarily difficult aria which few sopanos are able to pull off well. Then she sings in the finale of Act 1. All the while, the tessitura gets higher and higher (esp in her Act 1 aria where she has 2 exposed high B's), and the leaps and intervals are big and awkward, not to mention that she has to sing loud and do short coloratura. Then Act 2 begins, she starts in a duet, then a trio, then the dungeon quartet, then she sings a duet with Florestan (where she has 2 high B's side by side). And then the finale (another high B). Mattila's high B's are rock solid. Birgit Nilsson herself said that Beethoven didn't make things easy for the voice, Leonore has to sing long stretches of music at a very high tessitura in a part of the voice that even Nilsson found difficult!!! But Mattila does it all and does it flawlessly.
I am in the expensive habit of collecting Fidelios. I have heard all the most famous Fidelios in the market - Birgit Nilsson's 4 versions (!), Kirsten Flagstad's 2 versions (!), Gundula Janowitz, Christa Ludwig's 4 versions including her famous Klemperer version(!), Jessye Norman, Inga Nielsen, Leonie Rysanek, Waltraud Meier, Hildegard Behrens. I can definitely say that Mattila ranks with the best!! She can hold her own with Christa Ludwig, Birgit Nilsson, Leonie Rysanek or Kirsten Flagstad.
Fidelio rarely gets a good recording - the 1962 Klemperer set is still the best!! And it is rare that singers in their prime is captured on record with all the inspiration of the moment. If you like Fidelio, don't do yourself a disservice. Go and get a copy!! Also, buying this will encourage the Met to release more of their treasures!! I'm looking forward to Jane Eaglen's & Ben Heppner's 1999 Tristan Und Isolde.",1074470400,9,3285,4.636363636363637
1878953,5,B000094HMT,"I too saw this Metropolitan opera production on TV. It is further proof that the production can make all the difference. It also shows that anachronistic productions can make preeminent sense. My first experience of Fidelio was an older, traditional production on VHS, I believe from Glyndenbourne. It left wondering why Fidelio was in the repertoire.
This production helped me to understand. It is set somewhere between 1950 and 1970, judging by the dress and guns, in a unidentified fascist state.
The only weak spot in the casting is that Florestan (played by Heppner?) is not physically convincing as a starving prisoner. But his singing is fine. Other characterizations are superb. Pizarro (played by someone I don't recognize) is suitably evil. Mattila deserves all the praise in the top review.",1073865600,8,801,5.1692307692307695
1878973,5,B000094HMT,"Mattila and Heppner and Pape are superb. This is not easy music to  sing! A woman dressed as a man is not easy to carry off, especially  with TV close-ups. Mattilla does it with ease. Heppner has to wait until the 2nd and final act to sing. The Met Chorus is superb. Levine, as usual, is wonderful. My favorite ""Fidelio"" on DVD.",1347062400,,328,4.274193548387097
1878974,3,B000094HMT,"Birgit Nilsson, the revered Swedish dramatic Soprano, of the late fifties to early eighties of the Twentieth Century, sang the role of Leonore multiple times in her storied career. In her book, La Nilsson, she states, ""...So often one sees staging or settings that are horrible, ...adding nothing to ... the work"". The charitable foundation established by Ms. Nilsson awards the sum of $1,000.000. every two to three years to various classical musical performers or productions with this proviso as to productions, ""...to a specific production by an opera company ... and most importantly staged in the spirit of the composer..."". In Beethoven's composition of Fidelio, the action occurred in approximately 1805. In this production, the time setting appears to be in the 1950s. Some of the costuming is almost laughable, particularly the costuming of the women. This production would be more easily appreciated if it was heard only and not seen. Furthermore, Florestan is supposed to be slowly starving because of his diminished prison rations. Heppner must weigh 300 lbs. plus. It is practically impossible for the viewer to overcome these unfortunate visualizations.

Current Metropolitan Opera stagings of The Ring Cycle, Rigolleto, and Faust are additional examples, to this reviewer, at least, of the contemporary opera staging and set design that do not seem to be in the ""spirit of the composer"". Ms. Nilsson further states that ""Singing, which should have the most honored place in the opera, suffers when such egotistic, self-indulgence (by stage managers and set designers) is permitted...""

In this production of Fidelio, enjoy the singing, avert the eyes from the staging and sets and hope that Beethoven from on high never sees the production since, unfortunately, he could not hear it.",1331856000,4,1799,5.286713286713287
1878975,4,B000094HMT,"There are many recording and a few DVDs of Fidelio, so this Met production should be viewed in comparison.

Shall I compare it to the Bernstein's one?
That art was faster, and more passionate.

Overall, it was a pleasant surprise given the uneven level of many Met's productions.

Good things about the Met's production:

1). It was more entertaining than Bernstein/Vienna one, almost on an operetta's side - Rocco(Rene Pape) was a very amusing dork, Leonora (Mattila) looked surely as a man, very good; Don Pizarro animated the action further by singing and holding the burning dpche; the scene of descend to Florestan's cell which looks so hellish bared one obvious reference of this whole opera - to Alseste in Gluck and Admeto in Handel - visually it was certainly a much more vivacious than Bernstein.

2).  Overall tempi and the ending chorus tempo was more to my liking; I preferred this to the frenetic finale tempo of Bernstein; this was more in Furtwangler tradition, I think.

3).  Karita Mattila finally showed me the role she is formed for!  She was such a fiasco in Manon Lescault; now, looking at her in boyish attire, I wonder even more of how anyone could possibly conceive to cast her in the role of a beautiful graceful young courtesan, to whose charms seemingly all men succumb.  Yet here in the role of Leonore she seems to be firmly in place, even if she seems to sing with less ease than Gundula Janowitz and definitely less with Kirsten Flagstad; but still for the overall effect I'd give her 5 stars in this Fidelio.

4). I liked how Marzelline was depicted in the last scene of universal celebration - she looks like Zerlina deceived by Don Giovanni, and to add more insult to injury the dissolute in this case turns out to be a woman! Then poor Marzelline turns to be Giselle, plucking flower petals, as becoming insane from grief.  I truly appreciated that her character was treated with such attention - normally, she is disregarded as an unworthy plebeian casualty who was sacrificed on the altar of liberation of a noble without any regret or remorse on Leonore/Florestan part; yet this production attends to her as a human being; it was a nice touch.

Disadvantages about the Met's production:

The only big one was the absence of Leonore Overture.  I personally prefer when there is more music, although it could be argued that dramatically it does not fit too well.  Yet they played it so well in both Furtwangler and Bernstein versions that Maestro Levine should have shown what he could do.

I will not repeat my analysis of Mozart-Beethoven-Wagner Die Brucke in this review; it is in Bernstein's production review of mine.  But some other interesting observations are:

Abscheulicher! Wo eilst du hin? - Leonore's Rezitativ und Arie in Act I remind so closely of Ah! Perfido! - and it is ironic to find that earlier music here, in Fidelio.  Obviously, it was Beethoven's voice for a woman expressing a great emotional upheaval.

Next, dramatically, this opera is such a variation on the theme of Alseste!  The Queen Alceste risks, no - gives her life for her husband King Admeto and descends to the underworld to save him; Gluck's Alceste celebrates marital love in less ambiguous fashion than the earlier Handel's opera Admeto  on the same subject.  It is interesting to observe that straightforwardness of morals is increasing with time - Handel's Admeto is not totally faithful to his wife Alceste who sacrificed everything for him; later the King in Gluck's Alceste is already without such deviations on the husband's part; and here in Beethoven there is a sublime, totally devoted love between the spouses.  One might only contemplate which version of these three is closer to reality.

Also, Leonore/Alceste could be viewed as Tosca who succeeds; for a puritan moralist an ample space is provided to possibly conclude that only a true marital love and devotion is unyielding and steadfast, while a lover can make fatal mistakes, as Tosca does.  And of course, the eternal enigma of Tosca is - was it truly a love between Tosca and Cavaradossi or a tale of possession? Both of them seem to start becoming  infatuated with someone else as the action proceeds - Cavaradossi with Marchesa Attavanti and then Tosca with Scarpia.  Maybe this is why their plot failed, since there was no love anymore between them.  But that is another story '

What an opera Fidelio is, to inspire so many ideas! Even despite its goofy ""happy end"", it is a great masterpiece, not appreciated by its contemporaries only because at 1805 there was such an overabundance of great music.  What a pity - he could write so many excellent operas.

I give this performance four stars for the absence of Leonore Overture; otherwise it could get five.",1286582400,2,4760,4.808353808353808
1878976,4,B000094HMT,"I must start out by saying that this won't really be a review. I haven't seen the DVD, but I did see the production at the Met during its first season. I went with friends who knew nothing about ""Fidelio"" and I was looking forward to the Boris Aaronson production which I had seen as a student many times during the seventies. When the curtain rose, I thought, ""Oh no, another modernized version!"" However, I actually enjoyed the performance very much, first of all, because of the wonderful singing and conducting, and secondly, because it worked in a modern context. (Banana republic? Eastern European dictatorship? NOT Guantanamo, if you please!).
That said, I do so wish that there had been a filmed document of the older Aaronson production which was quite simply incomparable - in my view, the absolutely best ""Fidelio"" staging of all time. Isn't there a filmed copy somewhere that could be brought out on DVD? With the original cast of Ludwig, Vickers, Mathis, Berry... What a dream that would be.",1262217600,,1004,4.809248554913295
1878977,4,B000094HMT,"Karita Mattila brings a great deal of depth to the character of Leonora. This is a real woman she portrays, not the usual near-saint. Her Fidelio is very ""butch"" and ready to exploit anyone and anything in her quest for finding Florestan and securing his release. Poor Marzellina is just a cog in her machinations.

Rene Pape also presents a very different, near-comic, version of the jailer Rocco, not the man struggling with his conscience while trying to save his job. He carries it off with real flair.

The dialogue has been trimmed to make the opera move faster and it is very effective for the most part. The only problem is that the request for a trumpeter to announce the arrival of Don Fernando was dropped. This means that someone seeing the opera for the first time will miss the meaning of the distant trumpet in Act II, the most poignant moment in the opera. A pity.

The production seems to be set in the US, in the mid (?)-twentieth century. I am not American, so the clothing styles don't give me clues to to time that they give an American. However, while the time of the setting is not a problem, the place is. It is hard to visualise such a happening in the US of the 20th century.

Oddly, it is easier to visualise it happening today. The broadcast was in 2000, a year before the ""war on terror"" started. Had it been designed a year or two later, it could have been set in an US ""off-shore"" prison, far more effectively than in the present production. Florestan would have to be a potential terrorist ""renditioned"" (or whatever the verb is) to some CIA black site, with Don Pizarro using his position to pay off political scores. It would have worked better, and could be easily conveyed with prisoners being dressed in orange jumpsuits, being forcibly groomed, hooded and with heavy earphones blocking out sound, yearning for fresh air.

Is anyone from the Met listening? It could be the operatic equivalant of Emile Zola's ""Je accuse""!",1224374400,,1958,4.598853868194842
1878978,5,B000094HMT,"I've seen two other Fidelio productions and this is the first one I actually enjoyed/loved!!

1878979,5,B000094HMT,"I was fortunate enough to have been an audience member and witness the remarkable talents of Levine, Mattila and Heppner in person at the MET. That is why I was so thrilled to see this powerful production not only on PBS but to own it. Not many works come across with such human pathos written in the vocal line nor are there such singing actresses as of Mattila's stature. She carries the  show, she comes across so believable that you wonder how she does it and is able to maintain a difficult trouser role and remain credible. The DVD comes across brilliantly and you experience her every nuance not seen from the audience standpoint. The towering finale will cause you to leap to your feet as the audience did on the night I was there and the cast received a standing ovation - not common at the MET I assure you.",1160438400,9,817,4.410596026490066
1878980,5,B000094HMT,"This seems to be broadly reviewed here and elsewhere as a superlative video rendering of Beethoven's sole venture into opera.  However, I've never been able to understand why DGG has never brought us the Bernstein version from the Vienna State Opera -- shown on PBS 20 years ago.  It is the audio version of this production that they chose to represent Fidelio in their Complete Beethoven Edition which came out in 1997.  The cast includes Gundula Janowitz and Rene Kollo.  Bernstein's command of the theater was second to none, so this is a vote for DGG to bring out the other great performance of this work.

Until then, you won't go wrong with Levine and the Met.",1140134400,6,666,4.6581196581196584
1878981,5,B000094HMT,"When considering if you want James Levine's 2000 recording of Beethoven's only completed opera, ""Fidelio"" the question to ask is: ""What's your perspective on Fidelio?""  Should it be staged to reflect the time in which it was composed? (Ca. 1805) or should it have a more modern set and staging?  (as is the case here).  James Levine and the Metropolitan Opera orchestra play wonderfully and are - as almost always - very reliable and sensible in tempos, balance, and phrasing.  The singers: Mattila, Heppner, Pape, Lloyd, Polenzani, etc. are all excellent.  But the staging - which may seem controversial - is modern, with such items as 20th century handguns, American style Khaki military uniforms, and in the last act, the announcement of the President coming (not the governer as would be the case in Austria, 1805).  Some who insist on a more authentic, Austrian, period staging of Beethoven's opera may not care for this.

There are elements of humor brought out on the stage in some places, and I found the Prisoners' Chorus very moving.  I can't comment blow by blow on the singers, as I'm not a singer myself, but it all sounds excellent to me: well balanced with the orchestra and chorus, and in the bigger choral numbers, everyone is right in the action and on cue/target musically as well.

I love Beethoven's music, and always feel great comfort and a sense of victory and rightness about the world when listening to/watching FIDELIO, or hearing the incidental music to EGMONT. Beethoven had a firm belief in democracy, the triumph of right over wrong: justice for the accused who are innocent, and that one man/woman or class should not rule over another - he hoped for an egalitarian society somewhat as the French Revolution, Socialism, or later in Russia, Bolshevism promised, but did not deliver.  I think Beethoven would have liked living in a democracy as the United States, or Austria today, more of a parliamentary democracy for sure than it was 200 years ago during his lifetime.

If you don't want Levine's Met. production of FIDELIO, consider the following CD releases:  Klemperer/Philharmonia (EMI) or Bohm/Dresden State Orchestra (DG, 1969, recently re-released).",1133568000,20,2189,5.0
1878982,3,B000094HMT,"but....hear me now and believe me later:  KARITA MATTILA IS NO DRAMATIC SOPRANO!!!!!!  Just like Hildegard Behrens, who was somehow convinced (wrongly) that she had a dramatic voice, Mattila is shifting her career towards the more dramatic repertoire, with mixed success.  Her natural talent for acting and for conveying emotion with her vocal instrument works well for her in the lyric roles and gains her some sympathy in the dramatic roles.  However, whenever presented with the true tests in the dramatic roles, she always falls short.  Cases in point in this Fidelio:  a) In her centerpiece of the first act, ""Abscheulicher,"" Mattila's singing is so lovely and moving despite the stupid things she has to do with her hands.  Even in the closing section ""Ich folg dem innern Triebe,"" she moves along wonderfully.  But then comes the clincher: In ""Gattinliebe,"" the last word of the aria, she shrieks out the high B like a banshee, ruining the entire effect.  Granted, hardly anyone can negotiate this note with power AND grace (Gwyneth Jones in the Karl Boehm film is the only singer I've ever heard do it perfectly) but Mattila's overextension is so obvious you want to convince her to go back to Rusalka;  b) She sounds coarse in the demanding ensemble number that brings the first act to a close; c) In the second act, in the recognition scene, ""Toet erst sein Weib"" we have the same banshee howl (this time under pitch) on ""Weib"" that seems to define or be a calling card for her vocal limitations.

So, if Leonore had been written as a lyric role, Mattila would be astounding.  She looks good in her chimney sweeper outfit, and fakes gay marriage really well.  But, although she is slightly better than Soederstroem in the role, she falls woefully short in light of her great predecessors (Nilsson, Flagstad, Ludwig, and especially G. Jones). As is usually the case these days, we just have to settle.

Heppner is above average in what is basically a one-aria role.  The sweetness of his voice and his ability to sustain the lyric phrases of the ""In des Lebens Fruehlingstagen"" are admirable.  He gets somewhat carried away by emotion and falls out of step with Levine toward the climax of this second-act opener, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  It's a live thing.

Of the remaining cast, Rene Pape is the most satisfying, playing a curiously dissheveled and disoriented Rocco.  He is vocally perfect for the role.  Matthew Polenzani is the main casualty of the director's character re-thinking....he's bitter, petty, and aggressive, making you wonder why Marzelline would ever want him in the first place.  Nice singing, though. Jennifer Welch-Babidge sounds a little fluttery, but her penetrating voice cuts through the ensembles even more than Mattila's (especially in the finale) and adds some much-needed treble. Falk Struckmann's is just a character voice, which falls short in delivering the required level of malice.  Anyone from the chorus could have done as well.  Robert Lloyd sounds like Kurt Moll with the flu.

It's obvious this staging has a German production team, for nearly all German Fidelios are unrelentingly gray and drab.  The costumes in the finale are so haphazard and ugly that if the sound was off I wouldn't know if I was watching 'NYPD Blue' or 'Treemonisha.' (There are some REALLY lame attempts at jubilant dancing as well.) Luckily Levine and the Met orchestra and chorus provide such fine aural support throughout that the distastefulness of the sets and direction can be cheerily characterized as components of just another one of those ubiquitous eurotrash concept stagings we're all required as modern operagoers to endure.",1109116800,37,3677,4.988524590163935
1878990,5,B000094HMT,"When Act 2 of Fidelio is being poured out in the most glorious tones imaginable from Mattila, Heppner and Pape - who can possibly complain? Who would honestly want to replace any of them? Who can fail to be overwhelmed with gratitude to own this disc?
If I continue to count our blessings, I might mention the splendid Robert Lloyd drawing us to a thrilling finale as Don Fernando; and Falk Struckmann a convincingly evil Pizarro.
So it is certainly not complaining, but fulfilling a reviewer's obligation to tell all, when I admit that Jennifer Welch-Babidge is little more than adequate as Marzelline. One might wish for a purer vocal line in this role - like a Bonney or an Isokoski.
The production has a few eccentricities that don't quite work. I could pick holes, but to be fair the production as a whole functions well enough, and with singing - and, in most cases, acting - like this, who cares?
Brian Large's cameras are always where you want them. Sound is DTS 5.1; Dolby 5.1 or Stereo. Menu is in English only. Subtitles in German; English; French; Spanish and Chinese.

1878991,5,B000094HMT,"I can't recall the first time I ever heard this score, since after a single listen I didn't want to hear it again (my apologies to those who adore it).  Perhaps I fell into the myth of ""this is Beethoven's only opera and you can see why"" that some promote.

In any case, it was only years later that I happened to see this production on PBS, and completely fell in love with it.  Jurgen Flimm's towering gray walls seem destined for controversy, despite being handsomely designed and admirably well-suited for the story.  The set may be grim to some, but to my eyes it provides a neutral background against which Karita Mattila and the rest of the cast emerge in vivid colors.

Mattila is splendid in the lead role, and just sings and acts up a storm.  (I doubt anyone on the operatic stage has ever eaten a banana with more aplomb.)  Ben Heppner is also terrific, as are Rene Pape, Robert Lloyd, Jennifer Welch-Babidge and Matthew Polenzani.  Only Falk Struckmann, to me, disappoints slightly with some forced-sounding tone, but even he summons such stage presence that I didn't really mind.  This is one of the best-acted operatic productions I've seen in quite awhile.

James Levine gives a fleet performance of the score and draws magnificent playing out of the Met Orchestra, which has been praised to the skies and justifiably so.  The Met Chorus, attired in Florence von Gerkan's atmospherically gray uniforms, also gives its heartfelt all, especially in the renowned ""Prisoner's Chorus"" that should stir even the most apathetic of viewers.

The sound quality on the DVD is superb.  The filming, by Brian Large, puts you right in the middle of the action when needed, but with plenty of long shots of the large group numbers, which are thrillingly staged.  Highly recommended for many reasons.",1087948800,35,1800,4.8019480519480515
1878992,5,B000094HMT,"The Met has surpassed itself once again - here's my review for its recently released Otello. You must buy THAT Otello and THIS Fidelio.
I have just finished watching this stunning performance of Otello. The performance is so incredible that I feel absolutely compelled to write this review.
The biggest glory of this set is the absolutely stunning portrayal of the moor Otello by Placido Domingo. I've never been a huge Domingo fan (although I certainly respect him greatly). I tend to think that he has his fingers in too many pies. But this performance has changed my view completely. Domingo is not only vocally in superb form, his intense dramatic portrayal is electrifying! He loses all self-consciousness on stage and becomes Otello - there is no hint that he even thinks he is singing in an opera, he is so absolutely consumed by the role. Every expression on his face is under his absolute control. This is one of the most gripping portrayal of an operatic character I've ever seen. In this performance, Domingo absolutely blasts everyone else away - Fleming, Morris, Croft....
The second glory of this set is the absolutely ravishing soprano of Renee Fleming. Renee Fleming is also very much into her character. It is somewhat cruel to juxtapose Fleming's Desdemona with Domingo's towering Otello. Because you sense that Fleming's characterization is weaker than Domingo's. But that doesn't mean that Fleming cannot act - just that Domingo is simply too good in this role. In any case, Fleming's dramatic portrayal is also very intense - you feel and see her emotions and sorrow throughout the opera. She is a picture of chaste innocence in Act 1. In Act 2, her shock and grief are palpable. In Act 3, she gives Desdemona a somewhat stronger character than usual when Desdemona denies any marital infidelity. Her sorrow is heart-rending when Domingo accuses her of infidelity and finally, curses her at the end of Act 3. In Act 4, her Willow Song and prayer tugs at your heart strings. To top it all, Fleming's voice is absolutely ravishing. In some of her recent recordings, she has adopted some mannerisms. NOT SO DOWN HERE. She sings beautifully, and her singing projects her emotions but she does not overdo things nor does she engage in some of the somewhat irritating mannerisms of late.
James Morris is an excellent Iago. He acts well but certainly falls a little short of Fleming's or Domingo's intensity. Nevertheless, he is vocally excellent.
I like Cassio here. Not only is he really handsome, he is very much into his character and he is vocally in superb form.
The set, by Elijah Moshinsky, captures the Shakespearen atmosphere superbly. It is the exact same set (with very minor changes) as the 1992 Convent Garden Otello with Solti, Domingo, Kanawa and Serkus. It is a fantastic set.
James Levine's conducting is also superb. The tension never slacks and the drama keeps flowing.
An exceptionally fantastic production from the Metropolitan opera.
I've been following the recent Met releases - Fidelio with Karita Mattila and Ben Heppner, Tristan and Isolde with Jane Eaglen and Ben Heppner. And now this Otello with Domingo and Fleming. The Metropolitan Opera has really surpassed itself with all these 3 releases. They are all the best I've ever seen.
The 1998 production of Samson Et Dalila with Domingo & Olga Borodina ia scheduled for release in June 2004. I'm looking forward to it.
Also, the Met has actually videotaped Karita Mattila's stunning 2004 Salome. Because of lack of funding, it is stil waiting to be broadcast. But why wait? Every opera fan should WRITE IN TO THE MET and ASK THEM TO RELEASE IT IMMEDIATELY.
Go to the Met Website and find their contact email, and WRITE IN AT ONCE to ask them to release this incredible 2004 Salome.
In addition, The Met has videotaped the 2003 Ariadne Auf Naxos (Deborah Voigt) and the 2001 Wozzeck - all awaiting telecast due to lack of funding. Write in to tell them we want these on DVD. Show them our support.

And of, course, buy this Fidelio!!",1081468800,11,419,4.7534246575342465
1878994,5,B000094HMT,"This is already a classic!! To the reviewer below, Mattila and Pape are not only the future, they are the present. Look at Mattila's growing list of towering achievements - Countess (Mozart - Figaro), Fiordiligi (Mozart - Cosi Fan Tutte), Donna Elvira & Donna Anna (Mozart - Don Giovanni) Eva (Wagner - Die Meistersingers), Chrysothemis (Strauss - Elektra),  Elisabeth (Verdi - Don Carlo), Jenufa (Janacek), Leonore (Beethoven - Fidelio), Salome (Strauss)... many more not included here. Plus she is slated to do Isolde at Convent garden in 2007/08....
So yes, Mattila is the present AND the future. So is Pape who is one of those consistently great bass-baritones around. Heppner is the greatest Tristan alive today.
The recently released Tristan Und Isolde of 1999 featuring Jane Eaglen & Ben Heppner is also a classic. Don't miss that!!
Thank you Met for finally releasing these crown jewels of opera on DVD!!",1079827200,9,912,5.08
1878995,5,B000094HMT,"Con la llegada de este 'Fidelio' en dvd, esta opera de Beethoven vee la que es la mejor de sus versiones visuales con diferencia. El cast esta encabezado por una KARITA MATTILA impresionante por medios vocales (&iexcl;como canta su aria del acto I!) y por adecuacion escenica al personaje de Fidelio-Leonore. Sobresaliente para ella. El segundo sobresaliente se lo lleva el Don Pizarro de FALK STRUCKMAN, adecuadisimo a su personaje en lo fisico y en lo vocal. Fant&aacute;stico. El tercer sobresaliente se lo lleva la soprano JENNIFER WELCH-BABIDGE, que consigue una Marzelline soberbia en lo vocal y coqueta en lo escenico. Bravisima. Notable para el Rocco de RENE PAPE, quiza algo joven de mas para hacer creible el papel en lo fisico, pero con muy interesantes medios en lo vocal. Otro notable para ROBERT LLOYD, un autentico lujo para Ferrando. Bien el Florestan de BEN HEPPNER (que mejora un poco tras un aria de entrada bastante discreta) y suficiente para la peque&ntilde;a voz de MATHEW POLENZANI como Jaquino.
A buen nivel los cuerpos estables del Met, bajo la batuta de un JAMES LEVINE que impone tempos mas bien rapidos.
Muy interesante, inteligente y lograda la puesta en escena de JURGEN FLIMM, cuya actualizacion ayuda a la historia a ganar credibilidad.
En resumen, uno de los mejores dvd de cuantos han aparecido recientemente en el mercado. De compra obligatoria.",1077580800,5,1381,5.06140350877193
1878996,5,B000094HMT,"Another amazing thing about Karita Mattila is that she is so immersed in her character. After her Act 1 aria, there was an ecstatic uproar of applause. But she didn't even bat an eyelid - zero response. She just continued being Leonore and totally ignored the audience. It was as if the audience was 'sealed' off by a huge glass panel.",1076630400,5,335,4.508196721311475

7989239,5,B000094HMT,"Speaking only to those who are not opera experts, that is,  people like me, I can say that if you are at all inclined to see this form of music, Beethoven's only  effort in that medium is a must. I am having a personal Fidelio festival this week, watching the three versions I own: yesterday, that directed by Bernstein ca. 1978. It is top of the line and well worth having if you are going  to buy only one. Today was the turn for James Levine's version at New York City's Met. It is top of the line and well worth having if you are going to buy only one. I still have to watch the Karl Bohm version, ca 1970, which is a film with actors, and 'behind the scenes' singing by a top cast, that received all top reviews on Amazon. My only point in the reiteration is that  there appear to be a goodly number of acceptable renditions and, for your own pleasure, you should watch at least one.
The first thing that struck me in  seeing again the Bernstein version, yesterday,  was how good Beethoven's music sounds. Of course, I have been listening to it since hearing it played by Walter Damrosch (1862-1950) over radio, back in PS 247, when the teacher would tune in to his live broadcasts on the NYC radio station. Yet whenever I encounter him in something I rarely hear, I am struck  anew by his strength. At any rate,  for those who might be interested in which of the two versions I would  recommend, the obvious answer is either. The Stars of each, playing Leonora, the heroine, while different in styles,  of course, are both fine and popular with the public and Amazon viewers alike. I found the Met's first act scenery set, in the  prison  itself, with prisoners in their 'cages', cluttered up the stage,  detracted from the focus where it should have been, on the four singers involved. Bernstein's,  on the other hand, has the father, his daughter, one who loves her, and the heroes wife, parading as a man, puts them in a kitchen, completely separated from  the prison. To me, this gave that important sequence more impact than when set in the midst of a beehive of human activity amidst cells, tables, and who knows what. I thought the daughter, also, was better sung in the Bernstein version. On the other hand, the dungeon scene, the major focus of the second (and last) act, was better performed in the Met version....because Heppner, who is a large, heavy man of the Wagnerian type (of which he is a striking example in voice and  performance), is a more powerful singer.
The only other difference is one purely of taste. Bernstein's version is in period dress, Levine's modern. The latter offends some viewers and appeals to other. Take your choice.
In sum, this is a fine way to get to know the only opera written by a Master creator of music. There are others to choose from that will yield the same gratification with different voices, different conductors, different craftspeople creating the staging. It is a matter of chance which of the many would please you....but it is a pretty good bet that you will like any one that you choose.
(For convenience, I labeled these 'Bernstein' and 'Levine'....that was not to imply that they were the most significant force in the production...something I know nothing about.)",1449964800,,3233,4.577123050259965
7989240,5,B000094HMT,"I saw this production many years ago and I liked it very much, I found the quality of this DVD outstanding surprising me because it was filmed before the HD technique.
The music is magnificent, like every thing composed by Beethoven. It starts with an Overture that sounds like a Symphony and continues with beautiful assembles and some tenders areas as well as powerful choruses.
This performance has a very good cast starting with the main characters,who are very good singers: Fidelio/Leonora and Florestian played by Karita Mattila and Ben Happner. The rest of the cast, even the smallest characters were successful in their roles.
The direction as well as the orchestra were outstanding.
This DVD deserved 5 stars.",1442707200,,719,5.050420168067227

7989242,1,B000094HMT,"Of all the available DVDs as well as videos on YouTube, this is the worst staging of this opera. It is totally missing all the dramatic responses from Leonore to Rocco's statements in the family scene, Act I, and the rescue scene, Act II. The staging mistakes are too numerous to list. The most glaring mistake is, in Act II, after Florestan sang, ""God! How dark it is"" and just before he started to sing about the angel, he bent down and turned on a florescent light on the ground. This is absolutely unacceptable !",1415145600,2,516,4.442105263157894

7989244,5,B000094HMT,"What do other ""Fidelio"" operas miss that this one has? Humor. Whether recorded or live, a lot of ""Fidelio"" versions don't get that Beethoven actually had a sense of humor. What made me get this Levine version over the Bernstein ones and others is the ""Mir is so wunderbar"" staging: instead of four characters standing like stiff soldiers singing their parts, these characters' movements show their emotions and thoughts, and conveyed their humanness impressively.

I was surprised that the costuming (WWII period) didn't bother me because I'm a stickler for that sort of thing. But the drabness of the costumes and settings fit the ""Fidelio"" story perfectly.  BTW, the original ""Fidelio"" setting in 1806 took place in Renaissance Spain! Can't imagine that kind of setting today.",1388361600,,778,5.166666666666667
7989245,5,B000094HMT,"There is no doubt much to be said about the pros and cons of the production -- what is its time period, and why? -- and aspects of the staging -- was that business with the gun just clumsily handled on the night, or was it always thus? -- but let's leave that aside and think about the music.  A tight account of the score by Levine, and coming across nicely on my speakers, and some very distinguished singing.  I won't easily forget Mattila's singing of her big Act One aria, expressing not just a hope that her husband will be restored to her but an almost palpable desire for sexual reawakening, symbolized by a discomfort with her men's clothes expressed in the way she touched them -- all this while singing securely and powerfully.  Then in the Prisoner's chorus, well sung by the Met chorus, Mattila walks among the men as they leave their cells, looking for her husband's face -- she doesn't yet know that he's in solitary confinement in the dungeon.  In the dungeon scene in Act 2, the singing and acting of all three principals in the emotional climax of the opera (to me, at least) the great trio ""Euch werde Lohn"" is very moving indeed.  Here Ben Heppner, who not much earlier had delivered an impassioned ""In des Leben's Fruhlingstagen,"" comes into his own with beautifully expressive lyrical singing.  Rene Pape as the hapless but good-hearted Rocco provides the solid bass underpinning to the trio.  Pape's interpretation of Rocco as a totally morally confused man is carried through consistently -- he bows to the strongest will at any given moment, and at the end that happens to be Leonora's (who just happens to have a gun) -- and his voice is in splendid shape.  I have seen criticism of Struckmann's singing as Pizzaro, but I thought he played and sang the heavy very effectively.  Nice young lovers too in Polenzani (a quality voice) and Babbidge.  The staging (or maybe just the filming) of the ending seemed messy, with good ideas (like hoisting Leonora on the crowd's shoulders) mixed in with a lot of clutter and a close-up of a petulant Marzelline that seemed a bit of a downer amid all the rejoicing -- but the singing is great.  So if you're considering a Fidelio. don't hesitate over this one -- and then try the Bernstein/Kollo/Janowitz DVD.  It's great too.",1353715200,2,2290,4.641089108910891
