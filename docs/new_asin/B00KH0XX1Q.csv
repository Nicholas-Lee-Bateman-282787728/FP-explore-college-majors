6426207,5,B00KH0XX1Q,I saw the guys in concert in Chicago and they were phenomenal and then when this came to theaters I was among the first ones to get my ticket:) I am not a teenager- I'm just a huge fan of these guys and admire their talent and humor and this DVD has already been pre-ordered because I loved it and if you love 1D you love this!! It's a must-have for all Directioners,1415664000,21,366,4.027397260273973
6426208,5,B00KH0XX1Q,"MY DAUGHTER VALERIE AND I SAW THIS IN OUR LOCAL MOVIE THEATER TWO WEEKS AFTER SEEING THE CONCERT LIVE IN OUR NEW ORLEANS SUPERDOME. THE LIVE CONCERT WAS SO AWESOME!! THIS MOVIE SHOWS FROM THE BOYS  VIEW LOOKING OUT AT THE FANS . UNFORTUNATELY OUR MOVIE THEATER HAD THE VOLUME TURNED VERY LOW AND WE NEVER GOT THAT CONCERT ""FEEL"". BUT NOW THAT SHE IS GETTING THIS FOR CHRISTMAS WE CAN ENJOY THIS D V D JUST LIKE WE DID  AT THE LIVE CONCERT!! GREAT GIFT ESPECIALLY THIS CLOSE TO CHRISTMAS!!",1415232000,3,488,4.351648351648351
6426209,5,B00KH0XX1Q,"Even though I did attend their WWA tour in Dallas, Texas this past August it was amazing to see it in a different format. The theater captured all the great moments and passion of the boys and their many fans. It let me relive the concert experience all over again not to mention that these boys are wonderful and keep maturing and getting even better than before. I am an older fan but I have no shame in loving these boys and their music. I highly recommend this to their fans or anyone who enjoys great music. Their voices have matured so much during these past four years and I can not wait to hear their new album.",1414800000,2,619,4.254237288135593
6426210,5,B00KH0XX1Q,"I went to the WWA concert in Boston, MA and it was one of the most amazing nights of my life. I loved being able to go to the movie a few months later to ""relive"" my concert. I know that it wasn't actually the Boston concert, but the whole experience seemed to come back to me. The interview at the beginning was SO funny and their performances were amazing. If you didn't go to the WWA tour, I still recommend getting this movie as these 5 boys are the most amazing people and you feel as if you are there watching them live.",1413676800,2,526,4.0673076923076925
6426211,5,B00KH0XX1Q,"My daughters Cherelle, Kaitlyn and I are HUGE One Direction fans!! We've sen them in concert several times before. This summer we saw both the New York/New Jersey and Philadelphia shows on the Where We Are Tour. When we saw the film in the theater this past Saturday, the energy was almost as magnetic as the actual concerts! People were singing along to each song, crying, and screaming for the boys, just as though we were at an actual concert. We loved the interview portion of the film, as well as the fan selfies highlighted at the end. I, too, was disappointed to find that 4 or 5 songs from the concert were not featured in the theater release of the film. I hope to see them added on as bonus footage here. However, even in the absence of those songs, this concert movie is highly entertaining! I recommend it to any Directioner! The one bad thing that I can say about this movie is......once you see it, you're hooked! You'll want to go to go to EVERY One Direction concert!!",1413417600,9,984,4.441988950276243
6426212,5,B00KH0XX1Q,"Went to see this in the theater with my daughter so we could relive the concert that we attended a few weeks ago.  She is a HUGE fan, and I'll admit to being quite a fan myself. The concert was amazing and the film does a great job of recapturing it.  We also loved the interview portion.  I was a bit disappointed that a few songs from our concert were left off in the theater version--maybe to make it shorter? I'm hoping that they will be included on the DVD version that I am preordering now.",1413158400,6,496,4.145833333333333
6426213,5,B00KH0XX1Q,"Took my daughter to see this in the theater, probably the closest I will get to taking her to one of their actual concerts since their ticket prices are crazy high for decent seats. The guys are definitely entertaining and the interview done before the concert footage was hilarious. If you can't afford the actual concerts or would just prefer to avoid all the screaming fans, this is perfect.",1413158400,31,394,4.72463768115942

6426228,5,B00KH0XX1Q,"I love One Direction, so I figured this was worth watching.  I don't often watch concert dvds.  I tend to be too restless to watch something unless there's a strong plot.  So it's a testament to how well these men perform, that I sat through the entire thing.  If you're a Directioner or buying for someone who is, this is worth adding to the collection.  There's also an audio album of this performance which includes all the dialogue and chatter.",1464566400,,448,4.55

Sounds are great and it's a fun dvd but the first comment my 6 yr old daughter makes to me is ""mom? Why do they keep videoing all the girls in the crowd?"" This would have been a way better did if they would have focused more on the band and less on the crowd (who by the way is thousands of crying teenagers).",1453680000,,438,4.045977011494253

It really was so exciting! So I purchased the dvd for her for Christmas. Today she opened up her gift and immediately popped in the dvd. All of the family watched the concert in anticipation for the end to see her pic. Guess what? No pic! Apparently, the selfie pics were cut when they made the DVDs. Way to go! She was devastated and totally ruined her Christmas!

6426373,2,B00KH0XX1Q,"Very disappointing quality.  This is DVD quality, not bluray.

The direction is also lacking.  Shots of the band are cut so quickly you can't get a good look at the members.  Also the quantity of shots of the crowd is simply TOO MUCH.  The video is being purchased to watch the band, not screaming girls crying from happiness.  A few shots here and there, yes, but it was non-stop in this.

Take note of the humorous middle aged man they cut to a few times standing there suffering as his daughters scream with joy.

The sound mix is also not very good at all.  It lacks the power of a concert with little bass and the screaming girls is mixed in good enough to hurt your ears.

For fans of One Direction its ok I suppose, but the producers really did a poor job on this.  Their theatrical film This Is Us is a much better purchase.",1419033600,9,832,4.235668789808917

6426380,3,B00KH0XX1Q,"I purchased this dvd for my 17 year old daughter and even though it isn't a poor dvd, It is a bit disappointing. I've honestly seen better video footage posted online by fans. I'm not sure if there was a lack of footage or if the issue falls within the editing department, but this doesn't capture the concert experience as we have seen it.  50% of the concert is focused on audience members during the concert and not the boys. There wasn't one song in which they guys were the complete focal point as they cut to fans in the audience 5 or 6 times during each song. It's fine to show some fan footage during concerts but this was too much. The guys are also quite animated on stage. This also isn't captured although you see a glimpse of it at the end. I was also a bit confused as to why when Harry had solo parts, they didn't show his face or him for the most part. There were a couple of instances when they showed a few seconds but then showed footage of one of the other guys, or again, the audience members. It was just a bit odd as you could hear him lead vocally but couldn't see him. Vocally these guys are great and they performed well. I think any fan will love it simply because it's One Direction. I just feet the footage and editing fell short but this isn't a reflection on the group or their performance. I think whoever was in charge of this project failed them and they need to keep in mind that the fan base purchasing this dvd is doing so to see One Direction, not fans in the audience they don't know for half the concert.",1418428800,2,1544,4.181208053691275

Every time they show the guys, it's for like maybe 30 seconds and then immediately switches back to the audience . FFS we get it. The place was packed and sold out .

6426391,4,B00KH0XX1Q,"1D are great live, but I think the editing here is a little off and doesn't capture the ""experience"" of the show. I think there were too many fan-focused shots, like women being carted off by security (which I don't want to see at all) and crying every couple of frames. I've never seen a concert DVD have so many shots of the crowd and not the band. I feel like so much was cut out that makes One Direction a great band to watch and see live (if you go on Youtube, or watch their live TV performances you'll see how different it is). I want to love it, and the sound is great, they perform great, and the shots are good of the guys, but I have to give it four stars...I wanted to see more of the show happening onstage.
The ""Road to San Siro"" special feature was the best part of this DVD because the focus is on the band and how the show is done - it should have been part of the movie between songs. I guess I was hoping it would be done like ""Rolling Stones Return to Hyde Park"", or even the 1D footage from ""BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend: Glasgow"", both of which were also directed by Paul Dugdale who directed this. I'm just very surprised how this turned out compared to those. I think I was hoping this would be the DVD that can make a non-fan, a fan. Maybe it still will, but they are so much more better ""raw"" live than what this shows. I know though that any hardcore fan will be excited to have this DVD.
I want to give it five, I do, but the editing made it hard to follow and experience visually. I also was hyped up about it for months and heard great things about it, and I'm just disappointed I guess that it's so cut up compared to other videos and concerts I've watched of them.

One thing I would like to add is that if this was a live album I would give it five stars. Their performance is great, I wish it was on a CD or digital album. They are very talented, and out of this you will hear them give a great concert.",1417478400,12,1934,4.010362694300518

Only one movie theater played this movie in my town and I had to walk TWO HOURS just to go see them. Am I crazy? Maybe a little, but my love for this band is immeasurable. I absolutely enjoyed the movie and I could tell that everyone else in that theater did as well. The vibe there was so friendly and joyous--it was as if we were actually at the concert! I went by myself to go see that movie, but as I sat down and cheered, and screamed, and awed, and cried throughout the movie I knew that I was not alone.

8658550,3,B00KH0XX1Q,"I don't mean to sound petty, but this movie is nothing compared to the first film, ""This is Us"".  The guys are great, but there are no little snippets intertwined of funny things and background things during the movie.  That's what makes the first one so much fun.  I  know they had crazy lives, but in this film they all look really tired...Zayn only smiles once...he looks miserable...Liam is trying way too hard, when he starts doing that scissors dance I just, can't...they just don't seem to genuinely be having fun in this film like in ""This is Us"".  The don't need all the pyrotechnics and flashy stuff either, just watching them is fun!  It's too bad.  I think the designers of the show were trying hard to change it and make it better but really they just went overboard.  But if you want to see a live concert of 1D, then definitely get this movie.  They were a lot of fun and I'm sad they aren't together anymore.  I have just recently started listening to them and I really missed out.  Their solo stuff is ok, but it's just not the same.",1516924800,,1050,4.38860103626943
