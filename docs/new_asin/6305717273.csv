1067356,3,6305717273,"Over the past year and a half, I have been a quirky sort of workout junkie.  It was only a matter of time before Kathy Smith and I crossed paths, so to speak.  *G* I admit to being somewhat disappointed by this DVD at first.  I was sort of expecting something like you can find in Sharon Mann's ""The Works"" series.  I had also read that Smith is a great fitness trainer with some challenging workouts.  The cardio section, which has a lot of dance/hilo moves, was not very long (30 or so minutes, I think) and not challenging for me, but that is because I've done too much tae bo and boot camp workouts.  I think it might be alright if you have been out of the loop for a while.  The yoga section was okay, but again it's like the cardio section... It will do the job if you've been out of that loop for a while and it is only 30 minutes long.  That leaves me with the body sculpting section.  Now THAT part did make it worth my money!  *G*  I had a set of free weights that had gone unused for too long, and Smith made them feel happy and needed again.  The body sculpting section for the upper body is 20 minutes and for the lower body is only 10 minutes, but that one IS more than what I can handle right now and I am already feeling and seeing results.  These exercises are good if you have been out of the loop a while and/or if you are pressured for time and need a quick workout just to keep it all toned for the other, bigger routines.  I also will add that Smith has a very high-pitched voice and her style very cheerleaderish which does annoy me from time to time depending on my mood.  I'd rather not try to smile while I am doing my pushups.  But I understand about the positive attitude and all.  I just do that part different, focusing on the inside towards my heart.  It works better for me that way.",1071360000,4,1815,4.093484419263456
1067357,4,6305717273,"This DVD has one of the best formats I've seen yet. Unlike some reviewers, I don't mind that the segments are a hodge-podge of other Kathy Smith videos, because I don't have any others by her. This was my introduction. I really like the mix-and-match ability you get with this DVD. It's really using the format to its fullest.
Overall, the workouts are pretty good. Kathy indeed is one of those perky, whooping women, which is grating. I'm used to Minna, Karen Voigt, Tamilee ... much more subdued instructors. Once I got past that, though, I couldn't deny that the workouts themselves are pretty effective.
The cardio ticked me off at first because it's quite dancy, and I'm not very coordinated. By the second try, though, I had most of the moves down and got a good workout in 20 minutes. The upper-body workout was pretty intense. I really like how this one lets you do higher reps with lighter weights, or do fewer reps with heavier weights. That option alone will keep me coming back to that segment. The lower-body workout is NOT 20 minutes, like the Amazon description and the catalogue on the DVD says. It's 10 minutes. Luckily, it's a very effective 10 minutes. I can feel it today from yesterday's workout. The yoga's good, too, though it stops pretty abruptly as it's pulled off another, longer video. The warm-up and cool downs are OK. I usually don't use them, though; I usually start with another tape (maybe TotalMix's Quick Fix) and cool down with Tamilee's Stretch for Beginners. But it's nice to have them as an option on the same DVD. That way, you don't HAVE to go from one workout tape to another if you don't want to.
It would have been nice to have another cardio segment on this tape. I'm sure Kathy knows that variety is key, and we're supposed to do cardio more often than the other exercises. But, all in all, this was a good introduction to Kathy Smith's cheerleader brand of instruction, and it's definitely a good workout.",1038009600,15,1953,4.614942528735632
1067358,2,6305717273,"I was very excited when I bought this Kathy Smith DVD until I tried it and found out that there were old routines from old videos that I never liked.
However, I have purchased several other videos from Kathy Smith, such as ""Secrets of a Great Body: Lower/Upper Body Workout"" and ""Great Buns and Thighs Workout."" I lost 55 pounds in four months using all three of these videos from Kathy Smith. Those videos are priceless to me!!!",1030924800,3,429,4.512820512820513
1067359,5,6305717273,"By far the best workout DVD out there! I love the different training schedule's of which there are three: weight loss, sculpting, and stress reduction. Of course I am doing the weight loss one. After you select your program it then brings up a weekly schedule that you follow. Say it's Thursday, you just select Thursday and hit play, how simple. You can also customize your own schedule. Since I'm doing the weight loss track, I added Yoga to my Sunday (this is a scheduled day off otherwise). I actually feel like I have a personal in home trainer that is so inexpensive. I was put off by the high cost of actually hiring one. This is a great workout, I'm a beginner and it kicks my [bottom]! Highly recommended.",1026259200,4,714,4.5
1067360,5,6305717273,"Normally, I'm not a fan of workout videos, but since one of my biggest complaints about them is fast forwarding or rewind to specific sections, a DVD seemed like a much better choice.  Sure enough, I love this Kathy Smith DVD.  I can do only the sections I want or I can follow one of Kathy's training schedules.
The warm up is okay, but it quickly becomes boring after doing it everyday.  There's no challenge to it, so it sinply becomes a matter of doing it because one should.  It does give a decent warm up, and really prepares one for the Cardio workout.
The Aerobics/Cardio section is more based on dance than I expected, but that thrilled me since I had been bored of the normal jumping jack routines that I expected.  It took me about five days to learn the routine to the point where I can do it perfectly, but I liked mastering the moves.  The section is a little short and I wished there had been a longer thirty to forty minute Cardio section, in addition, but this one still managed to give me a decent workout.  After two weeks of it, however, it's becoming a little too easy.
The same can be said for the leg workout.  Short, effective, and fun but a little too easy.  However, in this section, Kathy does offer a few hints to make the workout more difficult.
The arm section is difficult to me, but this might be more because I have weak arms than because the workout itself is hard.  It offers to distinct levels of challenge which is nice, but I've only tried the easier level.
The abs and back strengthening section is very short (clocking in at about five minutes) but it is difficult.  I wish it was a little longer because I doubt that a five minute workout even if done every day would be that effective.
The yoga section is simple and relaxing.  It offers a nice amount of stretching for the legs and back.  I haven't done it many times, but my mother loves it since the other parts of the workout are too hard or too fast for her.  I wouldn't recommend it to someone looking for a yoga workout, but it is a nice way to unwind at night.
The cool down (stretching) section is nicely done and really stretches the legs and spine well.  It doesn't work the arms nearly enough, but it's forgiveable considering.  I've already felt an adjustment in my flexability and I think it's because Kathy emphasizes holding stretches the correct way for a good amount of time.
Overall, I'd suggest this fun workout to people who like dance aerobics and who are at a beginner or intermediate level of fitness.  Those who want a hard, long workout or those who are uncoordinated should probably look elsewhere.",990489600,27,2617,4.430062630480167
1067361,5,6305717273,"This DVD is excellent for getting in a little bit of everything: cardio, toning, and stretching.  The program is a compilation of some of Kathy's more popular previously released videos: Timesaver Cardio Fat-Burning, Timesaver Lift Weights to Lose Weight, Functionally Fit Lower Body Toning, and New Yoga Basics.  There is a 20 min cardio workout, an upper body routine, lower body routine, and abs and back routine, as well as a 30 min yoga workout.  A warm-up from Functionally Fit Peak Fat Burning and cool-down from Timesaver Lift Weights to Lose Weight are included for the cardio and toning wokouts.",986256000,2,605,5.03
1067362,5,6305717273,"I received this yesterday and I think it's great! I did the cardio portion of the DVD last night and MAN am I feeling the effects today! I would recommend this to anyone who wants a multiple workout DVD. It features cardio, toning, sculpting and even yoga! I also really like the portion for customizing your daily workouts. I think this is a great DVD.",984009600,6,353,4.446153846153846
1067363,5,6305717273,"I am a Kathy Smith fan and I use this video every other day.  As well as cardio and weight training, there is also a yoga segment.  I have her videos on VHS and now I want them on DVD.  It's a great deal; 3 different workouts on one video.  No it's not anything different then her video tapes but if you love Kathy Smith it won't matter.  You don't need weights for lower body work and believe me you still feel it. Upper body is quick with great directions.",973209600,13,458,4.044444444444444
1067364,2,6305717273,"The DVD format has great potential to provide a better home workout than VHS. The music sounds better, you don't have to fast forward or rewind, and you can customize the ""order"" your workout. The concept behind  ""Personal Trainer"" is that you can create your own workout  routine from a menu of different exercises; cardio, sculpting, and  stretching. This is a great idea that doesn't live up to its promises.  For  starters, the material isn't new. All of the workout segments are excerpts  from older Kathy Smith videos. Kathy is a great motivator and has put out  some good videos, but this DVD has a cheap ""cut and paste"" feel  to it. It just gives you the sense that they wanted to get a DVD on the  market for the sake of putting out a DVD. Kathy's ""Kickboxing""  DVD is a much better use of the technology. The 20 minute cardio workout  (from ""Cardio Fat Burner) is way too dancy for my taste, and too short  to provide a good workout. The personal advice section from Kathy even  suggests that you augment this workout with 20 minutes of walking. The  sculpting an toning section (from ""Lift Weights to Lose Weight""  and ""Functionally Fit/Lower Body"") is more effective, but you do  need a weight bench to do the routine. The yoga routine from ""New Yoga  Basics"" is nice for a change of pace, but not worth the price of the  entire DVD. The section that I'll probably keep returning to is the abs and  back strenthening  section. For 7 minutes, it's a good routine. The  ""extra"" features are pretty worthless, they include Kathy's bio  and catalogue of videos. If you're looking for something new, you're not  going to find it here. I'd wait until Kathy puts out a DVD workout  containing new material.",954028800,105,1711,4.589403973509934

7894123,5,6305717273,I purchased this cd to lose weight and tone up and it works great!  The instructions are easy to follow! You chose which fitness level you are most comfortable with.

7894124,5,6305717273,Great all around workout -- you can pick and chose which session (or more) to do on any given day.  Clear instructions.  Love the sculpting with weights workout.,1257638400,,161,4.714285714285714
7894125,2,6305717273,"Even though I have and like Lift Weights to Lose Weight which is a big part in this one, I don't like anything else on this DVD including the Yoga. Definitely non-motivating and boring. The weights section I can easily play from the original DVD. I would not recommend this one.",1221177600,,278,4.470588235294118
7894126,5,6305717273,"I chose this workout DVD because it had all the elements that I was looking for: strength training, aerobic and yoga. I've used all three workouts but I enjoy the strength training workout the best. I agree with other reviewers that it takes awhile to feel coordinated doing the aerobic workout.

Kathy does a great job of explaining each move and what you should feel if you're doing the move correctly, (for example, if you feel this too much in your knee and thigh sit back farther) as well as how each workout will benefit you.

I found the workouts demanding and although I haven't used the DVD that long it seems to me that the workouts are designed to be increasingly challenging as the user becomes more adept at each exercise,ie there are different ways to move your arms and legs to increase the challenge.

I would very readily encourage my friends to use this DVD.",1142467200,3,876,4.56687898089172
7894127,4,6305717273,"I ordered this DVD as well as 'The Rules of Fat Burning' when deciding on trying out a Kathy Smith DVD - she's released a lot of content, and truth be told I was a bit overwhelmed and didn't know where to begin despite reading a lot of reviews.

When I saw this DVD and how it combines a lot of material from other workouts onto one disc, I thought, ""Hey what a great idea!"" and got it.  Having no experience with Kathy Smith, and having only done exercise with Denise Austin and Billy Blanks who both couldn't cue to save their lives, exercising with Kathy Smith was very refreshing.

On this DVD, she has divided up the program into three sections, and recommended a training schedule to follow to achieve results.  She has a cardio program, a sculpting program and a stretching program.  Here's what they're built like.

CARDIO PROGRAM
- Warm up; 5mins taken from Functionally Fit: Peak Fat Burning
- Workout; 20mins taken from Cardio Fat Burner
- Cool down; 7mins taken from Cardio Fat Burner

Kathy Smith in the warmup has you doing knee lifts, demi squats, hamstring curls and short walks before stretching out the lower body.  In the cardio segment from Cardio Fat Burner, she does an 'add-on' routine, where moves are taught one by one and added-on in sequence to build an overall routine which is 'taken from the top' several times.  This is different to what I have been used to from Billy Blanks and Denise Austin, where the focus is on short combos, and the change is refreshing and good for a bit of variety.  It is on the dancy side, and while I can do it rather hap-hazardly (the 'box' and 'scissors' moves are on the difficult side, especially at the high tempo that she is going at), I am sure that my mother would trip over herself if she attempted it, so I won't encourage her to have a go at it. The cooldown felt a bit disjointed, since one moment you're finishing off a vigorous cardio routine, and the very next frame you're sitting cross legged on the floor in a zen like state; but I guess thats what is bound to happen when you have a piece-meal DVD like this one.

SCULTPING PROGRAM
- Warm up; 5mins taken from Functionally Fit: Peak Fat Burning
- Upper Body workout; 20mins taken from Lift Weights to Lose Weight
- Lower Body workout; 10mins taken from Functionally Fit: Lower Body Firming
- Abs & Back workout; 7mins taken from  Lift Weights to Lose Weight
- Cool down; 7mins taken from Cardio Fat Burner

For a bit more variety, I do wish that the warmup and cooldown segments for this sculpting section were different from the cardio section, but this is just a minor thing.  The 20mins of Upper Body strength exercises are taken from the first DVD of Lift Weights to Lose weights, and uses a dual track system to allow viewers the choice between lighter weights with more repititons and heavier weights with fewer repititions.  Kathy takes a moment to explain this after the warmup; I always march in place while she does this to keep my heart rate up.  A bench is used in this workout for one-arm rows, chest presses, and so on and so forth.  I do not have a bench, but I substitute for a chair or a stability ball and it does the job just as well.  The 10mins of Lower Body strength training relies heavily on squats - but she tweaks the exercise enough to keep things interesting; how does one-legged squats sound?  The 7min abs section is effective, and fantastic for someone like me who runs away screaming from long ab workouts even though it is the area of my body that I definitely need to work on.

RELAXATION PROGRAM
- 30mins taken from New Yoga Basics

I was a bit skeptical about this, and was worried that Kathy Smith might do a Denise Austin take on Yoga - what has subsequently been referred to as 'yogarobics', but was pleased to see that she actually took on the advice of a genuine yoga instructor and pieced together a very gentle practice.  While I think it is no substitute to my Yoga workouts by Sara Ivanhoe and Rainbeau Mars, it is good enough to recover,  rest and relax.

This DVD also gives you the ability to build your own routine, something that is used in Denise Austin's 'Personal Training System', and this programming ability is something that I very much like.

I shall keep on using this DVD until I can buy the individual DVDs of 'Lift weights to lose weight, 'Cardio Fat Burner' and the Functionally Fit workouts.  Cheeky advertisement for Kathy's existing material that has me completely won over.",1134518400,8,4468,4.498762376237623
7894128,5,6305717273,I love the variety in this workout series.  You can vary it depending in what you feel like doing or what you have time for.  I really like the upper body section - the routines with weights are very good.  I also like the cool down section and yoga parts.  They are great at relaxing you or helping your body cool down from a vigorous workout.  This video allows you to change it up by programming your workout the way you want.  Very good.,1099699200,2,441,4.190476190476191
7894129,2,6305717273,"I just attempted to work out to this video.  It will definitely take me several more times to anticipate the moves and understand what the heck is going on.  Plus, there are at least 10 people in the background who shout, hoot, ""woooh!"", and ""awww yeah"" at every new move Kathy does--this is extraordinarily annoying, especially if you're just trying to learn the steps.  In general, I think once you get the hang of it, it will probably be a fun workout.  Meanwhile, if perky, dopey people continuously shouting enthusiastically isn't your thing and sucks the motivation right out of you, I recommend something different, such as Denise Austin or Gilad.",1093305600,5,654,4.864864864864865
7894130,5,6305717273,"I've tried numerous workout videos, but I always seem to come back to this one. I really like this video because I don't get bored with it. Since there are different workouts, you can mix and match what you do from day to day to break the monotany. And, Kathy is really easy to follow. She explains the steps so that you know you are doing them right. And she lets you know in advance when to change moves. With other workout videos, I find myself doing the moves fast trying to keep up, and although I get a workout, it's mainly just me trying to quickly do the moves, but I don't think the moves are benefiting me the way they should. But I don't feel that way with this video. I like the cardio segment, although I could see how you could grow out if it as you get more advanced. But the weights segment even gives my boyfriend a good workout. Lastly, the abs segment, although short, is the most effective ab workout I've ever done, as long as you are doing it right. And actually, whether I decide to go jogging, or do another workout video, I always pop this DVD in to do the cool down stretching, because it really works the right muscles after a good workout. Yeah, she may be a little ""cheerleader-ish"" from time to time, but I'd rather hear that than listen to the robots from The Firm.",1081641600,,1296,4.251012145748988
