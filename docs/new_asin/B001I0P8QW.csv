8310296,2,B001I0P8QW,"Well I will try to make this review short and sweet.  I consider myself a BBQ enthusiast.  I own everything from high end pellet smokers, an Amerique by Cookshack, to a Big Steel Keg and a regular gas grill.  I grill or smoke on them every single weekend, rain or shine.  I love my BBQ.

With that said I also like to eat out once in a while and frequent BBQ joints.  It gives me a chance to compare mine against thiers.  Well I recently went to Famous Daves BBQ for Valentines Day.  I have to say that this place has pretty good Q.  I wasn't too fond of the chicken but I really loved their ribs.  I ended up purchasing a bottle of the Rich and Sassy BBQ sauce and a bottle of their Rib Rub.  I set out to make some Famous Daves ribs at home.  I found this DVD after some searching on the net.  I was pretty happy and thought that it was going to ahow me how to make Famous Daves ""SECRET"" ribs.  Well I got it in the mail with Prime shipping.  I watched the whole video from start to finish.  It does give 1 recipe for a rub and 1 recipe for a sauce.  He also tries to get you to buy his sauce and rub in the video.  It does not tell you how to make Daves ribs.  If that is what you are expecting, do not buy this DVD.  It was a big waste of money and I am highly disappointed.  Even despite the fact that it doesn't give his true recipies, I would have been happy if it had just shown how he actually makes the ribs in his restaurants, even using his rub and BBQ sauce.  It takes place out in a backyard and uses a regular Weber kettle.",1361491200,4,1538,3.893548387096774
