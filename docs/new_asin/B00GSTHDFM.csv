8627152,5,B00GSTHDFM,"One of my favorite George Raft movies.  I like the plot and him as a blue collar worker and his girlfriend was really pretty.  The two loan shark guys are actors I enjoy watching also.  I also recommend Nocturne, Red Light, and Souls at Sea for Raft fans.

8627155,3,B00GSTHDFM,"TO ME GEORGE RAFT WAS A LITTLE OVER RATED.  HIS BEST FILM FOR MY TASTES WAS HIS PERFORMANCE IN ""SCAREFACE"" AND ""THEY DRIVE BY NIGHT"", BUT HIS OTHER FILMS SEEM TO FOLLOW A PATTERN OF AN ACTOR BORED WITH HIS PROFESSION.  HIS ACTING IS STIFF AND HE DELIVERS HIS LINES IN A MONOTONE VOICE.  I THINK I ENJOY HIS OUTSIDE THE SCREEN ACTING AND LIFE STORY RATHER THAN HIS ACTING ONE.  THIS PICTURE IS ""OK""",1395705600,3,397,4.253333333333333
8627156,3,B00GSTHDFM,"Obvious story and Hollywood ending. Not George Raft's best. No need to guess who is ther bad guys, too much in your face.",1379116800,3,121,4.304347826086956
