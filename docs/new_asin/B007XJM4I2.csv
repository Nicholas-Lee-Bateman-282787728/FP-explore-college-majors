8522943,5,B007XJM4I2,I always loved Tooter the Turtle cartoons.  Gives a lesson and are funny.,1459296000,2,73,4.615384615384615
8522944,4,B007XJM4I2,always liked the Lizard.  Mr. Lizard the Wizard is in the show so Tooter has a way to try what he wants to do for a living and learns a comedic lesson.  liked the show when I was a boy.  it wasn't on much so it was kind of special and I always liked that intro and what the lizard says at the end.  this is good for nostalgic value.,1390867200,3,332,3.7
8522945,1,B007XJM4I2,I bought the dvd to use for counseling small children. The stories are still relevant but the audio and visual quality is extremely poor and distracting. I shipped it back.,1356134400,7,172,4.766666666666667
