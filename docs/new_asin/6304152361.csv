792755,5,6304152361,Great gift. I enjoyed watching this movie. This is a great series that brings back childhood memories of when I used to watch the first two movies in this series. Highly recommend!,1406246400,,180,4.65625
792756,5,6304152361,"This is a 'can't miss' if you like Kansas or any of Kerry's solo work. Though the video for which this music was written to go with is certainly no longer considered cutting edge as it once was, the music is still great on it's own. I've owned the video since it was released many moons ago, but purchased this cd because it contains a previously unreleased track, ""Credence Lent"" and additional versions of two others, one of which is my favorite, ""The Traveler"".",1403913600,,464,4.535714285714286
792757,5,6304152361,"I bought the Original Mins'd Eye and Beyond the Mind's Eye on VHS.  I was a fan then and still am.  This one was one I hadn't seen. I am pleased it sustained the animation quality and the audio track didn't disappoint.  I've bought much less expensive DVDs, but since they are so hard to find, I paid the price and am happy I now own it.  The video quality is better than VHS, since it's on DVD.",1378944000,,395,4.0256410256410255
792758,5,6304152361,i choose this order because i had the product on vhs and it was what i wanted happy happy happy,1366156800,,95,3.8
792759,5,6304152361,"What do I dislike about this album mmmhh....Nothing! If you are long time fan of Kansas or just a fan of progressive rock or just looking for a great instrumental album with many influences go no further than this. Plus if you already own the dvd for which this music is the soundrack you will be happy to know that there are two extra tracks not found in the dvd, one being a vocal version of The Traveller. Sometimes it sounds like Kansas, others like Pink Floyd and the vocal tracks (2 only) like Alan Parsons Project and sometimes like something completely new and unexpected from Livgren! So go ahead and give it a try.",1365292800,,624,4.434782608695652
792760,3,6304152361,"thought we were getting the DVD video and inadvertently got just the soundtrack. The electric music is ok, but it's not really all that entertaining without the animations.
There's nothing wrong with the CD or production quality, it's just not what I had intended to order",1350950400,,272,4.934782608695652
792761,4,6304152361,"I ordered the CD from Germany because they are not can not buy.
Business and delivery were without problems. The duty was collected at delivery. The CD was nevertheless still significantly cheaper than regular German market prices. For years, I try to get to Germany in the 80's music by Kerry Livgren, now I've found at last.
The absolute favorites are ""timeline"" and ""Art of the state"" with AD. The class of these two albums is ""the minds eye"" approach does not. However, it is a good album, hearing and recommended.",1294704000,,518,4.7032967032967035
792762,4,6304152361,"The video quality far surpasses the cartoon looking other videos in the series. Parts of scenes in here are also in Cyberscape which in my mind means there could be some connecting storyline of some kind. These videos really make you think. Anyway the reason it's missing one star is because of the music. I own the soundtrack and it's very listenable but it is too rock. They should have hired someone that was more techno-new wave. There are electric guitars in every song. If you listen to the other soundtracks in the series, they are much more subtle.

Otherwise I reccomend it but reccomend the others in the series more.",1264550400,,627,4.648648648648648
792763,5,6304152361,"I've read both sides of this review and find that this Minds Eye video featuring Kerry Livgren is amazing. It is one thing to make music, but a whole new thing for animation to be given to you and your are asked to put music to it. Kerry Livgren did a great job! And the animation was great too.
I find that those who are the most critical of this series are usually people interested in animation(CGI) or already have some experience in animation. They always criticize another's work as though they can do better. Well then go ahead and make your own and submit it for review let's see what ya got! As for me I loved it and reccomend to all. Oh yeah, one more thing..Horray for Free Speech!",1229126400,,692,4.290076335877862
792764,1,6304152361,"The only two reasons you would consider viewing this are because you're a fan of the Mind's Eye series or interested in CGI in general. Take note: it doesn't live up to either standard. Don't purchase it, even used -- in fact, don't even rent it, or borrow it from a friend that may have been duped into owning it. If you are forced, or yet choose, to watch this, mute the television and play a deep ambient soundtrack instead. The only quote from the back cover which can be trusted is ""Strap yourself in..."" You'll have to if you intend on watching through the end.
Both the musical score and the CGI are themselves inept -- taken together, even worse.
The ""camera"" motion, when not stuttering behind moving objects, is too clinical, you can almost feel the programmer's commands... ""turn POV left, stop. Pan up, stop. Zoom, stop."" The content suffers the same fate of poor production. For instance, the first vignette, 'Oceanic Celebration,' is simply a montage of marine settings. They've taken this collection and given it a title and not much else -- sort of like the dolphin screensaver theme you can buy from an office supply store. Some of the other segments at least have a little story, and 'Out of Step' has a little lesson, but even then you're subject to the amateur editing -- quick and redundant cuts between scenes and camera angles.
The quality of the CGI itself is underwhelming, not bad, but not good either. But let's say you're willing to watch this anyways. You will still have to deal with the soundtrack. The cover quotes ""Powered by a soaring original score from KERRY LIVGREN, founder and former guitarist of legendary rock group Kansas."" Right there you know you're holding a winner. I suppose some of the tracks aren't horrible, but taken in context with the content, this is just a marketing concept gone awry. The rock score not only clashes with the whole idea of CGI, but it doesn't even match the animation in each piece. (Correction: there is a single minute of synchronicity, with the festive hammer in 'Out of Step' -- but its little theme is so jarring from the rest of the piece that you shake your head anyways.) That's bad enough, and then you get to the vocal tracks with 'One Dark World' and 'Aspen Moon' -- these are perhaps the only redeeming value of this odyssey, which at its worst moments will at least finally make you laugh.",1087084800,,2375,4.630331753554502
792824,5,6304152361,"Graphics were great!!  There were (I believe) 11 tracks, and each track was different in theme, which added spice to the DVD.  The entire musical theme was done in a rock musical format, with several tracks (2 or 3) actually had singing in it by Kerry Livgren (who was a member of the group: Kansas).  I felt that the music went extremely well with the graphics!!  It was very upbeat, not radical or harsh in any way, and there was very little singing in it - just music that helps sweep you away with the beautiful graphics.  If you don't like Rock, you may not like this DVD, but I still recomend giving it a try.  Some tracks featured spacey worlds, one had dinosaurs, spaceships, underwater scene with a dolphin being chased by a sea monster, tropical islands, robots, and just far out computer animation!  Highly recomended - I'd say that this is the best Computer Graphics DVD I've purchased (out of 6 so far).",1078963200,,916,4.515151515151516
792825,4,6304152361,"This album is one of the best things KERRY LIVGRIN has done, with or without KANSAS. Most of it is instrumental. The surpris-
ing thing, or one of the surprising things, is LIVGRIN's guitar
playing, which has never sounded better, especially his lead
guitar playing. This is the most hard rock oriented album that
I've heard him do. Another surprising thing is how good these
songs are. My favorite songs include the album's opening cut
""OCEANIC CELEBRATION""; a very heavy progressive rocker with
a very catchy guitar riff and some outstanding drumming and
CREDENCE LENT and UTOPIAN DREAM. What's nice is that it doesn't
sound a bit like his work with KANSAS and it sure beats anything
they've done since he left. A very enjoyable progressive hard rock album!",1016064000,,759,4.891472868217054
792826,3,6304152361,"I've always dug computer animation, and I love the ""Mind's Eye"" series, but this particular installment is seriously hampered by the choice of Kerry Livgren (of the prog-rock outfit Kansas) to supply the music score. Musicians previously featured in the ""Mind's Eye"" series, such as Thomas Dolby and Jan Hammer, were appropriate choices. Livgren is not. I suppose I liked the band Kansas back in the mid 1970s when I was in high school, but today I wonder, ""What was I thinking???"" Such music is hopelessly incongruous for cutting-edge computer animation showcase ... and toward the end when Livgren actually starts SINGING is when I REALLY started to cringe. The eye candy here is just as enjoyable as always; but if you buy this, make sure you turn down the sound and listen to a nice techno or trance CD instead.",989020800,,815,4.787234042553192
792827,4,6304152361,"One of the greatest things in this volume is the fact that it includes one  of the funniest computer animation sequences ever. With today's technology,  it's no great accomplishment to create wonderful action clips, etc., but  it's a great animator that can create truly human humor that makes you howl  with laughter. This one does it to the max! One of the funniest sequences  ever set to animation is here when a very Orwellian group of hammers pound  out a lifeless beat in synch with one another while a rebel hammer plays  all of the counter-point and syncopated rythyms, etc -- the peer group  pressure builds and the humor is pure belly laugh stuff! Great! The music  here is brilliant if you love art rock or what's called ""prog""  but if you don't, then it's just too much for some I've shown it to. Kerry  Livgren's score is very good but the vocal cut at the end is mediocre.  (That's the reason for the 4 Star and not 5 rating.) But this is a  magnificent effort overall. I have nearly the entire series and know many  of the artists involved in making this. This is great stuff. If you want  one of the finest titles in the genre, this is it...",965433600,,1157,4.4170616113744074
792828,5,6304152361,"The graphics are superb. The underwater chase scenes in Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace are very reminiscent of the chase scenes toward the beginning of this video.
If you are a Kansas fan, you'll immediately spot  the style of Kerry Livren, the musical genius behind this video. Only two  tracks have vocals. One is overtly Judeo/Christian expressing that only the  Creator can satisfy. Livgren became a Christian before Kansas disbanded  (just listen to Dust in the Wind or The Wall).
The vocal track (next to  the last) is the only one I don't like. The vocalist is Kerry's son, Jacob.  It would be a good song if it weren't for an unecessary, irritating  falsetto part that he sings. It is very badly done.
If you do not like  Kansas, you will not like the music. My brother first showed me this video  a couple of years ago. I went out and got it myself. As soon as I am  finished here I am ordering the DVD!",961804800,,921,4.428571428571429
792829,5,6304152361,"Odyssey Into the Mind's Eye takes you on a journey through state of the art computer animation. The audio track was written by Kerry Livgren, the musical genius behind most of the best work of Kansas, including ""Dust  In The Wind."" The amazing thing about the music is that all of it was  written and performed by Livgren, who is multi-talented enough to play many  different instruments. The tracks are then layered together to form a  seamless composite that sounds like a full musical group. Don't miss this  one!",960076800,,516,4.752808988764045
792830,3,6304152361,"This video has outstanding computer graphics - there is no question on that.  The soundtrack, on the other hand, leaves a lot to be desired.  It was apparently written by a guitarist from the group  Kansas but at any  rate is pretty lackluster.  The music varies between lame & dull.  If I  were to rate just the computer animation alone, I would give this DVD 5  stars. If, on the other hand, I were to rate the music alone, I would give  it 1 star.  Therefore, I chose 3 stars as a happy medium.  Would highly  suggest that people interested in this genre check out Beyond The Mind's  Eye.  The soundtrack to it is written by Jan Hammer & is far, far  superior to this one. The graphics on it are comparable to this.  I would  still recommend this DVD to those who are really, really into this type of  stuff as the computer animation almost makes up for the uninspired music.",949795200,,878,4.314814814814815

792832,5,6304152361,"I bought the VHS version a while ago, and with the purchase of a DVD player this one was a definate must! (especially when VCR is only mono on a Prologic capable receiver ;)  My only disapointment in the DVD ver is that  there were no on screen menus, and no 'index sheet' included that tells you  where the indexes are (but I got a snappy so I can capture the images and  make my own index sheet)
I also noticed a couple minor details that  change from dvd and vhs versions.  Like the female voice on one of them  isn't as loud on dvd as it was on vhs, and 'SMV' logo differs, and there  are no ""previews"" for other movies that are out (one difference I  have noticed and liked on all DVD's so far :), like I said nothing  major.
BTW, I actually rode on the 'lava car' IWerks turboride when on  spring break in smokey mountains, was really cool.  you actually saw two  movies for the 1 price, this was the 2nd one and people were coming out  saying they liked this one over the first one (indy race car one)  Can't  wait till next one comes out.",935020800,,1046,4.103960396039604

HOWEVER, this brought back a lot of great memories and enjoyment until my mother-in-law came in and said, ""What kind of drugs was this guy flipping out on?""  The graphics are great and the music is very...80's.  I had to 'xplain to her this was the start of a new era in digital graphics, you know, LIKE YOUR SON IN LAW does at work?!?  I appreciated the shipping, I couldn't tell what I had received (buy a lot from Amazon), until I removed all the bubble wrap (unlike my upcoming review on the VHS tape I bought at the same time from a different vendor).  This seller, was outstanding.  Got it is a couple of days, played it until my mother-in-law started twitching, one eye bigger than the other, but her working foot was bouncing to the beat.
