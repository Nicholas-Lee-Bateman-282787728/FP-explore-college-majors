8583821,4,B00CNWGSYA,"Rebounding is an *excellent* form of exercise and rehab, strength rebuilding if you are recovering from a knee injury. I think the guy who started this created if after he himself injured his knee and was so impressed that he created the series. I really appreciate the thought process behind this and often wonder why it isn't more popular... the only conclusion I have is that buying a rebounder is an investment and most people maybe don't want to drop $250-$300+ for a decent one. IMHO it is worth it. The DVD's were all made in the early 2000's give or take a few years. They are definitely a little dated and this is apparent throughout the video from the fashion to the music to the feel of the whole thing. I guess this could be charming or annoying depending on your perspective... I am not a fan of the music they used, just super cheesy techno... and I like some electronic music but admittedly am picky with workout music so it probably won't bother you :)",1487203200,,968,4.47457627118644
