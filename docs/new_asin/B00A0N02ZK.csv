8545909,1,B00A0N02ZK,"Several of my friends and acquaintances are addicted to these DVD horror combo packs from Walmart. No matter how much I try to dissuade them, they keep buying. My roommate Mike arrived an hour ago with this ""Master Collection"". He had beer and nachos. He said, ""J., wanna watch this with me?"" After setting down the food and booze, he proceeded to try to open the DVD. Instinct caused me to jump up and slap the DVD out of his hands like I was a goalie during the FIFA WORLD CUP. ""What are you doing, man?"" he yelled. I grabbed the DVD and stood up. ""Before you open this,"" I cautioned, holding up the DVD. ""Make sure you watch the trailers first.""

We got on youtube and watched the trailers for each individual movie. You should have seen the horrified and disgusted look on his face. He tried to look away but I forced him to look at every one of the trailers. After he was done, he went to the bathroom and upchucked. The trailers for the movies were so awful he had a hard time finishing them. I felt bad that I had to force him to watch these trailers but at least he didn't watch the actual movies.

After he came out of the bathroom, I handed him the unopened DVD, the receipt for it, and his car keys. Ten minutes later he called me from Walmart. ""Hey J.,"" he said. ""I just want to call and thank you for what you did. If it wasn't for you, I would have watched those godawful horror flicks that look like they were filmed on a $200 Walmart camcorder."" He paused, then said, ""I don't know what I'd do without you, man.""

My eyes started to water and I knew his eyes were watering to. I could only say, ""I know, man. I know.""",1376438400,5,1633,4.177777777777778

8545912,1,B00A0N02ZK,"I don't mind low budget, if they follow the story, & develop the characters somewhat...This 2disc set does NONE of that!!...It all seems like they made random music videos, and tried to piece together a movie around each one...Terrible!",1363478400,,236,5.076923076923077
