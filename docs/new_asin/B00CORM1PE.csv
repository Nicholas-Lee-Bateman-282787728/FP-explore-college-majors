5731505,5,B00CORM1PE,Am a fan of the Beck series in books that came out years ago and enjoy the video version as much as the books.,1376092800,,110,3.625
5731506,5,B00CORM1PE,I got  the 7-th and the 8-the seasons and enjoyed them greatly. The end is sad for me because Gunwald is quitting and that could be a sign that we will be no more episodes.,1375747200,,172,3.914285714285714
5731507,1,B00CORM1PE,"This series of Beck films from Sweden is excellent. The acting is first rate; the stories are wonderfully complex; the camera work is terrific and for the most part, the music score delivers just the right amount of tension and drama.  I first was made aware of this series of detective films when i bought the 3rd series of ""Beck"" when I visited Sweden.  The picture was sharp, the sound exemplary and the addition of English subtitles made this series a must see.
The first series of ""Beck"" unfortunately was released in Sweden without English subtitles, and so when I discovered that a company here in the US was going to release the first series, I was excited at the prospect of finally seeing this first series.

Imagine my disappointment when I discovered that these DVDs were no longer in the sumptuous PCM stereo/5.1 Dolby/DTS as in the Swedish release, but in a disgustingly transferred mono that was distorted and virtually un-listenable.  I think this company spent less that a dollar transferring these great stories.  They should be shut down out of business after displaying such shoddy work. Utterly appalling on every level. They're just trying to cash in the popularity of Scandinavian detective thrillers and are not prepared to spend any money on making a decent product.

Do yourselves a favour and purchase the 2nd series onwards from the original Swedish video company. The sound and picture are night and day from these crappy transfers, and they have subtitles.

I know I've given this release only 1 star, but that is only for the appalling sound and picture from these new transfers, and not for the stories, acting and other excellent technical credits that accompany the original Swedish release.",1374969600,5,1725,4.927586206896552

8584076,5,B00CORM1PE,"I enjoyed the first episodes of this top-drawer Swedish crime drama so much that I have purchased the entire collection. The prodigiously talented Peter Haber stars as the title character (fans of the internationally acclaimed film franchise based on the Stieg Larsson novels will recall Haber in a chilling turn as the cultured but totally deranged mass murderer Martin Vanger in ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" - ""Mn som hatar kvinnor""); homicide investigator Martin Beck, a solitary and deeply troubled man at times, is ferociously dedicated and highly ethical, very private, very giving and very complicated, and a joy to watch. The marvelous Mikael Persbrandt, singularly appealing and subtle, portrays Gunvald Larsson as no else could: a violent and equally complicated individual with a short fuse, a man who has no compunctions whatsoever about cutting corners or extracting  useful information by beating the tar out of the occasional lowlife. He cares about getting results. The entire cast is marvelous: Stina Rautelin, Marie Granzon, Rebecka Hemse, Mns Nathanaelson and others provide first-rate support. Superb plot lines every time. Highly recommended.",1456012800,,1168,5.488888888888889

8584080,5,B00CORM1PE,"Just keeps getting better and better. Love watching Gunvald character grow and evolve. love that he and inger, beck's daughter, are friends. my only complaint about this series... the poor quality of the dvd's. have had prob with sound and double pic. mhz has enough money to do better. one of the best of the swedish detective series. an aside, just when u thought gunvald couldn't get any sexier, he does!",1427500800,,407,4.746478873239437
8584081,5,B00CORM1PE,"Excellent series all around. The stories are always interesting and sometimes unusual; they provide just the right amount of character development to get you to appreciate and even like the main characters. Peter Haber and Mikael Persbrandt are great to watch as they deliver excellent performances along with the rest of the cast.  The character played by Persbrandt, detective Gunvald Larsson is edgy, unconventional and always interesting; his interactions with boss Beck (Haber) and his other coworkers are priceless.  Beck's excentric neighbor Oscar, played by Mns Nathanaelson is, to say the least, a real trip (both good and bad) and he will make you laugh, particularly when you watch Beck's reactions and the look on his face. I purchased the entire series because I could not get enough of it.  I understand new episodes will be made this year, so I look with anticipation to those.  I suggest you watch the first episodes first because events in the character's lives evolve as the series progresses. Highly recommended.",1415404800,,1031,5.155688622754491
