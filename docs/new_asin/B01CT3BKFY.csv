8754103,5,B01CT3BKFY,"I did not watch this series when it was broadcast many years ago.  Maybe if I and others did it would have lasted more than one season.  The verion I bought is the Region 2 version as it was a good price.  Plays only on Region 2 or multi region players.  The picture quality is excellent and the sound is great and has SDH subtitles.
Very enjoyable set of programs of the ""who done it"" genre of mysteries by the Levinson and Link team that also came up with Columbo and Murder She wrote.",1517961600,3,487,4.148936170212766
