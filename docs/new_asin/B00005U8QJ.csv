1663608,5,B00005U8QJ,"Last season MSP (Matchstick Productions) released Ski Movie, and it was voted by many skiing websites and magazines to be not only the year's best film, but the best skiing ever caught on tape, ever. This made the expectations VERY high for this year's MSP release, Ski Movie 2: High Society. And I do think that it is safe to say that this movie does pack enough punch to top what was said to be the best ski film ever.
SV2's opening montage involves the featured skiers in the movie and a silver suit-case. You know right away that this is not going to be any ordinary ski film. It the breaks into some highlight shots from the movie to Saliva's song, ""Make me a Superstar."" Following is 2 hours of the most insane, adrenaline pumping, crazy skiing ever to be caught on film, again. In this film MSP amazingly managed to get footage from nearly every skier on the freestyle scene right now, and nearly every single skier has a resonably long part. It also includes some other sports as well, like a 2-3 minute clip of today's top snowmobilers (this section includes Dan Gardner doing the 211 foot world record jump and Jim Rippey landing the first backflip on a snowmobile), and Shane McConkey doing some crazy base jumping. But the biggest highlight in the film would have to be the 11 day boat trip to a ""middle or nowhere place"" in British Columbia where Dean Cummings, Seth Morrison, and Shane McConkey become the first ever to ski this unknown mountain range. There is also a funny mini movie Spoof on the movie Cast Away about a character name Saucer Boy that plays in between the skiers parts
Other skiers in this film include (I'm not going to list them all, there are too many): C.R. Johnson, Tanner Hall, Mike Douglass, Vincent Dorion, Boyd Easley, Philou Poirier, Eric Pollard, Evan Raps, Shannon Schad, Wendy Fisher, and Aaron McGovern.
As I said before, this movie easily has the punch to top Ski Movie. I recomend this film to anyone into freestyle skiing. And if you would like to see some more new school skiing then I would reccomend you check this years Poor Boyz Productions release, Propoganda.",1015718400,,2116,4.6005291005291005
1663609,5,B00005U8QJ,"I have been watching these Steve Winter movies for years now. The step to DVD is a great move. It allows you to jump to your favorite seens. The Gaffeney Brothers are hillarious and Sethro Morrison and the rest of the bunch rip, as per usual. The fishing seen with Brad Holmes is pretty funny too. This isn't quite as good as 'Sick Sense', the best by Steve Winter, but it is still a very good movie.
Definately worth purchasing.
Enjoy.",1008633600,,436,4.395061728395062
1663610,5,B00005U8QJ,"I have seen ski movie over thirty times...I used to watch it all that time and wounder if that was the best ski movie ever to be made. Boy was I wrong...Ski Movie has some of the sickest jumps and  the biggest mountains ever. Shane McKonkey, Tanner Hall, CR Jhonson and Seth Morrison among others tear it up. Not only is the skiing great...but the snowmobile clip was sick...have you ever seen a guy do a backflip on a snowmobile...or seen a guy jump 211 feet. Probaly not. I say look under the couch scrap around for the 20 or 30 dollars and buy this movie..SUNDAY RIVER RULES...Sugarloafers SUCK.",1008115200,2,598,4.486238532110092
7954244,5,B00005U8QJ,"7/2016 update. You probably can't find this movie anymore. But, if you're looking for it, keep looking. I just watched it again last night and still love it after many years of viewing; it is top notch (prob find it on u tube).

If you only buy 1 ski movie, make it this one. I have about 40 extreme sport dvd's (mt biking, skiing, crusty series, etc...), but this one is the best for winter action.

PS: If you can find it, MIND The addiction (16mm) is also great.",1177718400,,465,4.213483146067416
7954245,5,B00005U8QJ,"Absolutely the best ski movie ever made!!!

Insane action, and great sound tracks.

I watch it before ski season to get me in the ""mood"", although I would never attempt anything done in the video. It's insane!!",1125100800,,210,4.648648648648648
7954246,5,B00005U8QJ,"I've got all three of MSP's rocking flicks.  1 and 2 are must haves.. 3 is a bit of let down, but they had a lot to live up to following those two! 2 has great variety including some base jumping on Baffin island that will blow you away!  I'm hoping 4 will live up to the first two!",1045008000,2,282,3.76271186440678
7954247,5,B00005U8QJ,"This Movie couldn't have gotten any more Action-Packed if Jackie Chan stared in it! But I was a little dissapointed, that I didn't get to see any ""skin shots"" of Wendy Fisher!",1038960000,,175,4.5
7954248,5,B00005U8QJ,"Worth every centivo I paid for it.

7954250,5,B00005U8QJ,This movie rocks. Great soundtrack. Saucer boy sleeping under twigs is too funny. Holmes segment by the far the best.,1021420800,,117,4.9
