Its only redeeming value is that it was co-directed by the great Phil Karlson(Brothers Rico,Phenix City Story,etc.) though it is credited to William Nigh, a competent B movie journeyman, and it stars the old Warners heavy Barton MacLane.",1424044800,,336,4.711864406779661

Perennial character actor Barton MacLane stars in this darn good family melodrama as John Tate, a man troubled by unemployment and a marriage gone awry when wife Amy (Wiley) decides to take a job. His farmboy son Henry (Larson) is having trouble adjusting to big city life because of a bully named Spike (Binyon).

John gets into a poker game at a bar and loses all his pay, unaware that card-playing partners Frank Kraeger (Anderson), who's also John's landlord, and Eddie Mohr (Harlan) are 5th columnist spies gathering data on cargo shipments and factory output.

Henry enrolls the family mutt Hobo in a special war training program, but Hobo flunks two important tests because of traumas he experienced on the farm. The dog is discharged from the program. Henry thinks his pet is a coward until the story's dramatic climax when Hobo comes to the rescue and helps thwart Kraeger's and Mohr's sabotage plot.
