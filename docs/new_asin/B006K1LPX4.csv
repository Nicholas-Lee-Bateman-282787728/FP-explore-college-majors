5000359,4,B006K1LPX4,"Very nice movie. Good to see how wooden sailing boats have been produced.

I do recommend to people interested to improve their knowledge in this area.",1383177600,,151,4.8076923076923075
5000360,3,B006K1LPX4,"The movie is interesting enough, but it is really about Benjamin and Gannon and not the details of building a wooden boat.",1382400000,,122,4.590909090909091
5000361,3,B006K1LPX4,"I asked for this DVD for Christmas, and was really looking forward to it, being a longtime Woodenboat Magazine reader and having built two small boats myself. I was disappointed, though, by the content (the image quality was also a problem; pretty grainy in some segments). I wasn't expecting an instructional video, but was hoping a chronological narrative of the building process, and a good look at how things were actually done. Often, we see glimpses people doing things in the workshop which are not even named--let alone described in any detail. We're not even told what kind of wood they're using! We learn very little about the boat shop and the owners, as well. We get glimpses into their everyday lives, but not much history about the boatyard, their experiences, their dreams and early commissions, etc. Instead, we see them silently walking about here and there, joking on a porch, pondering an old garage they want to tear down, stamping their feet in the cold. A lot of the film is impressionistic: lengthy silent views of snow collecting on lumber, kids playing in the yard, and the like. Nothing about building the masts and spars, nothing about the sails--they just suddenly appear on the boat at the end. I hate to say it, but I started looking at my watch after awhile, and wondering when they were going to get to the meat of it all.",1357776000,3,1354,4.717299578059071
5000362,5,B006K1LPX4,"This is the story of a boat. Not just any boat, but one made out of wood, love and showcasing the lifetime of experience and talent from some of the greatest boat designer/builders of our time!

During the course of this movie you will get a small peak into the world of an amazing shipyard and the visionaries who run it. G&B shipyard builds and restores wooden boats to a degree not seen since the Herreshoff days.

If you are even remotely interested in wooden boats this is a must see. It is to wooden boats as A River Runs Through It was to fly fishing. If you don't want to sail or build a wooden boat after watching this there is possibly something wrong with you!",1344643200,,671,4.275590551181103
5000363,5,B006K1LPX4,"An engaging, charming movie. Jeffrey Kusama-Hinte reveals his appreciation for the human element in the craft of boat building. The film ""Charlotte"" was created with every bit of the craft that went into the creation of ""Charlotte"" the boat.",1336694400,,241,5.205128205128205

8499934,5,B006K1LPX4,"This is a stunningly good film for any lover of wooden boats, and all those familiar with G&B boatyard. Love the texture of the photography, and the atmosphere of the boat shed. Also, like how the film opens during winter when the boatyard is being shoveled out. Confirms that New Englanders live through the seasons, not around them. Also conveys the seriousness of G&B, and what it takes to build a life around craft. Great job!",1461024000,,430,4.671052631578948
8499935,5,B006K1LPX4,Wooden boat building is a lost art. Glad to see that there are people out there who find it as fascinating as I do. My husband has had a wooden one design sailboat for close to fifty years. Maintaining it is a lot of work but it is a labor of love. He also builds model sailboats to scale so I found it interesting to see the Charlotte built the same way as his models only on a much larger scale. I wish I lived on the Vinyard to watch these shipbuilders in action. Perhaps on a future vacation they'll allow observers.,1433808000,,520,4.107843137254902
8499936,2,B006K1LPX4,For me this felt more like watching a family vacation film.,1428537600,,59,4.454545454545454
8499937,5,B006K1LPX4,Watch it over and over...,1426550400,,25,4.2
8499938,4,B006K1LPX4,I would give this a five star for the subject and the romance of the ship.  The movie lacks pace at times and is truly a project from the heart. I am grateful somebody made this film and that people still build ships like this.,1424131200,,227,4.044444444444444
8499939,5,B006K1LPX4,This reader is not given to boating but the vast detail of this DVD captured my attention from the very start. I followed these people on the entire voyage of constructing a magnificent sea-faring boat. Truly an experience in superb craftsmenship and patience! The stamina and determination of these men to complete such a challenge is truly impressive!  I appreciated the immense investment of time and energy given to the building of this boat. A marvelous gift to give or to keep!,1415923200,,483,4.890243902439025
8499940,5,B006K1LPX4,"Having been a regular visitor throughout Nat's project, occasionally helping with a launching or a hauling, I have always admired the  craft of building wooden boats. Being a part of the extended G&B family has been an inspiration to me for nearly thirty years and this film pegs the essence of the two men who are the leaders of this center of boatbuilding and repair. Always willing to help anyone who walks through the door, they are one of the biggest reasons why I live on Martha's Vineyard..",1393459200,,497,4.6477272727272725
