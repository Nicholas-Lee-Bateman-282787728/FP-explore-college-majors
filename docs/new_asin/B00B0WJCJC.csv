I found the tab a little disappointing and the video a little disjointed at times. As an example of the latter, Mary starts by explaining that the basic 8-bar blues in key of E can often be recognized because many times it starts with the one chord (E) in the first measure followed by the five chord (B7) in the second measure. The only variation is what happens in the third measure. Sometimes the five chord (E) is played again and sometimes the four chord (A7) is played. From there, Mary goes to the first song, How long Blues, in which the chord played in the second measure is E7 - not the five or four chord. Okay so the first song is an exception to the general statements she starts, but it would have been nice to briefly mention that fact. Maybe it's just getting used to Mary's style of teaching. The more I play the DVD over and over, practice and study, the less the little things frustrate me.",1453593600,,1072,4.285714285714286
8560415,5,B00B0WJCJC,"I agree with Tim O'Neill's assessment. Amazon gets these DVDs from Homespun.com, where each instructional DVD is rated based on the level of difficulty. There ""Exploring 8-Bar Blues"" is rated as level 3 on a scale of 1 (beginner) to 5 (very advanced). It's unfortunate that Amazon doesn't include this information in their product description as it would help set realistic expectations for the buyer. Not only is this intermediate level instruction, but it assumes some proficiency in finger style techniques.

Mary does an excellent job in walking the player through songs of progressively greater difficulty, ending up with the original song (""How Long Blues"") redone in a much more interesting arrangement. The two view presentation (one on each hand) is very helpful. Mary plays through songs at speed and with vocals before breaking them down in slow, detailed sequences, showing alternate ways to play some segments. The emphasis is not on learning a specific arrangement but on learning techniques that can be adapted and used in many songs.

I highly recommend Mary's DVD if (1) you're interested in learning to play 8-bar blues (although these techniques transfer over to the more common 12-bar blues), (2) you know the basic chords in the key of E major (it will help if you know these chords in positions up the neck, but don't worry if you don't going in, she'll show you), (3) you are fairly proficient in ""finger picking"" techniques (these techniques don't adapt directly for flat pickers), and (4) you're willing to put in the time to really learn her material. Mary does an excellent job of presenting the material in a manner that promotes learning, but it is up to the student to do what it takes to learn from it, and that is a good deal of time and practice.",1388620800,3,1779,4.867986798679868
8560416,5,B00B0WJCJC,"Clear explanation.
Good video split screen to see right and left hands.
Tablature available in PDF is well described.

I have other DVDs by Mary Flower and I like her teaching style.",1371081600,3,182,4.6875
