This story is about crime in an unnamed mid-west state (Cincinnati Ohio). Dix hides when he sees a police car pass. He ducks into Gus caf but is arrested for vagrancy. The robbery victim cant identify Dix in the line-up; Dix has a menacing look. The police commissioner wants to find Riegenschneider, the Doc. Lt. Dietrich is ordered to crack down on crime in his area. The Doc has a plan for a big job but he needs financing from an important man like criminal lawyer Emmerich. Hooligan Dix owes a lot of money to Cobby the bookmaker. Emmerich has his private reasons for making this deal - he is broke. Emmerich knows respectable men who can dispose of the loot. His private detective will try to collect his debts so he can finance this operation. [Crime is organized like other enterprises.]

The story tells us about the people involved. Emmerich plans to double-cross the rest of the gang, but he needs $50,000 to finance this robbery. [The money figures are out of date, multiply by 20 for current values.] The men are picked for this job. Doc surmises that Cobby is using his own money (an omen). Doc has a hunch he cant trust Emmerich. The job begins and goes as planned. The boxman drills the safe then adds the soup so the door can be blown off. This sets off all the alarms on the block (unforeseen?). The men vote to continue. The valuable jewels are scooped up and they leave. There is a glitch when the watchman drops his pistol and it goes off hitting Louis. But the make a clean getaway and go to meet Emmerich. Emmerich admits he doesnt have the cash as agreed, but he wants the jewels. His private investigator pulls a gun to hijack the jewels. Dix draws and hits his target, but is wounded. Doc tells Emmerich to get in touch with the insurance company to settle for 25 cents on the dollar. Dix refuses medical treatment, unlike Louis.

The Happiness Boys are rounding up the usual suspects. Things start to go bad for Dix and the Doc. The plan was perfect in all details but accidents happened. A cab driver remembers taking the Doc to a bookie joint on Camden West. Lt. Dietrich gets Cobby to cooperate. The police visit Emmerich to arrest him for complicity in robbery and murder. His niece cries and tells the whole truth. Uncle Lon won't be going to Cuba. [You get a feeling the others will soon come to a bad end.] The Doc wastes time watching a young girl dance to a nickel jukebox. Its getting late. Soon it is too late for Dix. He won't get very far.

Riegenschneider had a perfect plan, but it overlooked human error and nature. Those involved in a crime cant be trusted after the job when the loot has to be split. Unless they are family (the James gang) or have a history of working together. The plan was flawed from the start in using people who could not be trusted afterwards. Life is no respecter of desires or designs, but imposes patterns which no one is capable of foreseeing said Milovan Djilas. W. R. Burnett wrote novels and was a script writer in Hollywood (like Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett). If you liked this film read the novel.",1412294400,,3116,4.480633802816901
