3881163,5,B0029WLJH0,"For the many of us who are lovers of the No. 1 Ladies' Detectives and the oasis of peace and old time values to be found there, this DVD is a delightful look at that world's talented creator as he immerses himself in the environment that inspires him. Botswana's beautiful countryside, and its warm people, definitely confirm the image presented by McCall Smith in the books. The man himself seems a gentle soul, a humanitarian with a genuine love for Botswana. Nice music, beautiful scenery, a way of life that is still relatively unspoiled, despite the ravages of AIDS; a (relatively) peaceable kingdom.",1248220800,118,605,4.883495145631068
3881164,2,B0029WLJH0,"Sorry, this was pretty darned boring -- nothing you would ever watch again",1408060800,,74,4.769230769230769
3881165,5,B0029WLJH0,Excellent  handling of the beauty of this culture.,1406937600,,50,5.25
3881166,4,B0029WLJH0,"Having been to Botswana, I thought I would enjoy hearing  McCall Smith's observations, reflections and interaction with the people of Botswana. This DVD did not disappoint.  It is worth viewing for the background on the No. 1 Ladies' series, and also if you have an interest in Botswana.",1406332800,,287,4.958333333333333
3881167,4,B0029WLJH0,Alexander McCall Smith provides a great commentary on his Botswana setting for the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.  It is fascinating to see Smith travelling through the area which inspired the series.,1392336000,,201,5.28125
3881168,4,B0029WLJH0,"This video shows McCall's love for the people and land of Botswana. I found that both were very much as I had envisioned them based on his descriptions in his books. That is a great accomplishment for a writer. There are journeys to places he writes about in the books, and interviews with several women, including the former head of the ""orphan farm"" and the director of the nature preserve. It is also shows him at work, and as a writer I found that interesting. I am besotted with Africa because of his books, and those of several other authors I've read recently. And I've watched this video twice now and will probably do so again just for the scenes and the sense of pace and caring.",1391558400,3,689,4.433070866141732
3881169,5,B0029WLJH0,"As some may have already discovered, there are almost no usable resources regarding Botswana.  While I personally enjoyed the book seriest, the value in this DVD is that it captures many authentic perspectives on Botswana.  We use it to introduce students to Botswana before they begin their study abroad program.",1391299200,,313,5.24
3881170,5,B0029WLJH0,"If you listen to any story in the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series, you will be Hooked...
I have listened to every story more than once, and I have watched the tv series several times.",1389225600,,188,4.25
3881171,4,B0029WLJH0,"Fairly good and I enjoyed it very much as I liked the series, it was a little jumpy in places as to subject matter, BUT it made me want to visit Botswana.",1385510400,,154,3.84375
3881172,5,B0029WLJH0,bought this as a gift for a friend who also loves A. McCall Smith. It is a good compliment to what she read.,1380758400,,108,3.739130434782609
3881173,5,B0029WLJH0,Anything in Alexander McCall Smith's No 1 Detective series on DVD is an automatic YEA! for me.  My only problem is that I'm not clever enough to keep current with Alexander McCall Smith's newest CDs and DVD's!,1368662400,,209,4.648648648648648
3881174,5,B0029WLJH0,Made me feel like I wanted to jump on the plane and go to Botswana.  Could picture the area from the books.,1363910400,,107,3.8636363636363638
3881175,5,B0029WLJH0,Enjoyed Mccalls perspective on the show.  It's a shame HBO has not brought the show back to television.  I thoroughly enjoyed the interactions of the characters and culture of the settings in Africa.,1359590400,,199,5.0
3881176,1,B0029WLJH0,"I am so sorry to say that when I received this DVD it accidentally cracked as I pulled it off the holder.  It will not play and so I was not able to review it.

3881177,5,B0029WLJH0,"perfect condition, as anything sent out should be... and  a joy to watch Botswana through this masterful storytellers eyes.  He connects the travelogue to Mma's eyes.  We see what she speaks of.  I can't wait to go...",1327536000,,217,4.783783783783784
3881178,4,B0029WLJH0,"This was a nice 50 minute documentary about Botswana and the author of the No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. It was definately not worth the purchase price, in fact it is the type of extra material you get on DVD's and should have been included for free on the Ladies' No 1 Detective Agency boxed set.",1305504000,2,298,4.339285714285714
3881179,5,B0029WLJH0,"Another in the famous series set in Botswana. Like the other No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency tales, this offers an entertaining story that also reveals aspects of Botswanan culture. A good read ... you can't go wrong with Alexander McCall Smith!",1300320000,,244,4.975609756097561
3881180,5,B0029WLJH0,"I've been a fan of Alexander McCall Smith for several years now. My first book was found in a book store (Barns & Nobel). The Ladies' Detective Agency"". I tried at the library - no books by Alexander McCall Smith. So, I would go back to B&N. I've ended up with 10 of the ""Ladies"" books in my collection. Then I heard there was to be a TV series on HBO - which I don't get. So, I go to a trusted source - Amazon.com

There I found the complete first series and the ""Footsteps"" DVDs!  Love Amazon.com!",1297209600,,499,4.081632653061225

3881182,5,B0029WLJH0,"If you've read the books (I have) you will love the visual (I did).  The script is true to the books.  The acting is marvelous.  It is a wonderful experience for the whole family whatevere the age.  And don't miss the features that come with each program.
Only negative is the design of the program selection:  Lots of buttons to push.",1279238400,,335,4.426229508196721
3881183,4,B0029WLJH0,"The NO.1 Ladies' Detective Agency, written by Alexander Mc Call Smith, is a wonderful series about people who live in Africa. This is the best series of books I have read in years! You will fall in love with the characters. Precious Ramotswe is unforgetable. After reading this book, you will think about people and Africa in a new way. I am now reading the 11th book of this series and I am sad to realize I will have to wait for Mr. Smith to write and publishes another one, before I can continue finding out what these splendid characters are up to!",1273881600,,552,4.368932038834951
3881194,5,B0029WLJH0,"After reading the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series, I have been very curious about Botswana and its people. This video of the author traveling in the country and interviewing different people gives us a glimpse of why he loves it so much. It's one way to experience the locale without leaving home. I highly recommend this video.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Botswana-In-the-Footsteps-of-the-No-1-Ladies-Detective-Agency/dp/B0029WLJH0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Botswana: In the Footsteps of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency</a>",1273881600,8,580,7.183098591549296
3881195,5,B0029WLJH0,"I have watched this DVD several times already and learned something new everytime. I really have enjoyed reading the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series. This DVD gives more insight into the history and culture of Botswana.
I also was fascinated by the author himself as he talks about his characters and his inspirations for his books.",1270684800,7,338,4.947368421052632
3881196,5,B0029WLJH0,For all of us No. 1 Ladies' Detective Fans this a wonderful background video.  It takes you to a number of the places where these stories take place and where the 'Mini Series' was filmed.  Excellent.........,1269820800,6,208,4.75
3881197,1,B0029WLJH0,A poorly done tale of Botswana.  There is no theme and little to redeem the herky-jerky series of interviews.  Does not do justice to the opinion that McCall Smith has for Africa as expressed in his other books.  Skip this one.,1268006400,9,227,4.487804878048781
3881198,5,B0029WLJH0,"As usual, Mr. Smith delivers!  If you have read any of his other books, this one will live up to your expectations.",1265328000,,115,4.2272727272727275
3881199,5,B0029WLJH0,"If you're a fan of the author, you just have to go behind the sceens and watch him in action.  I find this video very relaxing and watch it whenever...  Everything falls into place and you feel great that someone is watching over us and seeing things as they can be and not just as some would try to make us believe.  The scenes of Africa are good, but it is the author who makes it all worthwhile.",1263686400,4,398,4.076923076923077
3881200,5,B0029WLJH0,"It is a pleasure to join Alexander McCall Smith on this travelogue and commentary on his impressions and experiences in Botswana.
He takes the viewer to beautiful locations like the Okavango Delta and the Mokolodi Reserve, and also shines light on the issues of
the country like orphans from aids, auto accidents, and death during childbirth.

I've showed this video to a few friends and they have all enjoyed it.",1259539200,13,413,4.9
3881201,5,B0029WLJH0,"I started reading McCall Smith with ""The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency"" and immediately fell in love with his easy style and slow pace that seems to transport you to this simpler world.  Since then I've read everything I could find of his, and also listened to his lecture on CD ""Confessions of a Serial Novelist.""  McCall Smith is as easy to take in person as in his writings.  In this video he introduces you to Botswana where he gets the inspiration for his most famous series of books.  Anyone who has read the series and wishes they could go see what the real Botswana is like should view this.  It's the next best thing to traveling there with McCall Smith as your personal guide.",1256601600,27,687,4.464
3881202,4,B0029WLJH0,"I'm giving this DVD 4 stars, rather than 5, not because I don't love it.... only because it isn't quite what I expected.  I loved the first season of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, and have been to Botswana three times.  So, ordering this DVD was a no-brainer for me.  I expected this DVD to be more of a documentary about the making of the HBO series, which it is in some part.  However, it's much more than that.  It also paints a beautiful and realistic picture of Botswana, which isn't a bad thing.... except it will likely encourage more people to invade my ""personal paradise.""  As a professional nature/wildlife photographer, I discovered Botswana in April of 2008.  I have returned twice since, conducting (along with a Native tracker) specialized field workshops for small groups of photographers.  So, I will be showing this DVD to fellow and aspiring photographers, as a great way to introduce them to Botswana.

Alexander McCall Smith skillfully weaves his love of Botswana into his series of books.  I really like that it also comes across in this DVD.",1253145600,69,1069,4.760869565217392
3881203,5,B0029WLJH0,"I treasure each new book of the #1 Ladies Detective Agency as a special treat.  I schedule an afternoon on a hot summer day in my hammock and allow Alexander Smith McCall to transport me to Botswana.  This DVD is so much of the same, only with visuals and sounds that reinforce the visit.  He does an excellent job of introducing his readers to Botswana with that same magical slow pace and investment in the land and the people.  If you enjoy his books, and even if you have never read his books... you'll enjoy this time with him.",1252800000,77,532,4.343434343434343
8358354,5,B0029WLJH0,Loved the series and also enjoyed Smith's informational video on Botswana.,1503187200,,74,5.818181818181818

8358356,3,B0029WLJH0,actually ordered the wrong thing...wanted the movie. Probably deserves higher praise than I gave it.,1474848000,,100,5.733333333333333
8358357,3,B0029WLJH0,"Bought this for some older friends who have greatly enjoyed his series.  Their comment was that this was rather boring and did not recommend I purchase it again, or even watch it.",1437004800,,179,4.59375
8358358,5,B0029WLJH0,"In The Footsteps is not a super slick production affair of poor quality knocked off to drag in more money for the coffers. Instead, it is a thoughtful, charming, and graceful nod to a place and people held in some regard by Mr. McCall. The pace of the ""film"" seems very much in keeping with the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency books' laidback style and one can definitely sense Mr. McCall's abiding affection for the land and people of Botswana as he narrates, the camera following,  his way about the land discussing different places and events that may find, or have found, their way into Mma Ramotswe's world and then the scope of the film broadens to Botswana's problem with HIV infections and to Botswana's prosperous diamond trade...both of which, of course, are touched upon in  No. 1 books. Botswana:  In The Footsteps has brought books I've enjoyed into an even sharper focus for me. Well done and thank you, Mr. McCall.",1436227200,3,928,4.716049382716049
8358359,5,B0029WLJH0,If one has the No 1 Woman Detective Agency dvd this is a worthy companion to have.  A.M Smith is delightful to watch and to hear in this Botswana addition.  One wishes there would be continuing No 1 detective stories.as it was so very delightful. and well acted.,1434499200,2,262,4.4375

8358362,5,B0029WLJH0,"Once you become acquainted with this author you will feel like one of the 'FAMILY"". No matter what series you follow you will be thoroughly entertained. Always pleasurable.",1422057600,,172,5.178571428571429
