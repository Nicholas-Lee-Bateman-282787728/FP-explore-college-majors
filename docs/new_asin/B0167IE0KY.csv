7456696,4,B0167IE0KY,"Directed by Jay Roach (Austin Powers, Meet the Parents) from a screenplay by John McNamara (Eyes, Fastlane) adapted from the book Dalton Trumbo by Bruce Cook, Trumbo is the story of Dalton Trumbo, one of the most brilliant screenwriters Hollywood ever produced, who was blacklisted in the 1940's and 50's because of his refusal to cooperate with the Congressional investigation/witch-hunt for communists in the movie industry.

It would take a long time to properly explain the situation what existed in the US in the period following the end of WWII and the Cold War that took its place. The short version is that in those years the US succumbed to a paranoia that communists in America were all agents for the Soviet Union and were working to undermine and eventually overthrow democracy here, and because of that anyone who had ever been a communist or had ever associated with anyone who was a communist was deemed suspect.  A particular focus of this paranoia came to bear on Hollywood where it was believed communists were using the film industry to subtly spread communist propaganda. As a result, Congress, specifically the House Un-American Activities Committee, subpoenaed ten screenwriters suspected of communist involvement to testify as part of their investigation.  Trumbo was one of those ten.  Feeling that the investigation was a violation of the First Amendment right to freedom of expression, the ""Hollywood Ten"" as they came to be known refused to cooperate, which resulted in them ultimately being fined and sent to prison for contempt of Congress.  They were also ""blacklisted"" in Hollywood which made it impossible for them to find employment. Their treatment caused others who were later subpoenaed to be more cooperative and many ended up giving up names of people they knew or suspected of involvement with the communist party, including friends and associates in the film industry that they had known and worked with for years.  It was a very dark time and many people's lives and careers were destroyed as a result.  This film does a good job of showing what that involved, how it worked, and how it made people turn on each other out of fear. And how some people unscrupulously manipulated that atmosphere of fear for their own purposes.

The direction and screenwriting in Trumbo are, to be honest, workmanlike, adequate to the task of conveying events but seldom hitting the high bar in terms of really moving you. The performances are what really make Trumbo work. A lot of attention has been paid - deservedly - to Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad, Malcolm in the Middle)'s audaciously eloquent and increasingly driven Dalton Trumbo and Helen Mirren (Hitchcock, The Queen) 's superficially patriotic but insidiously venomous Hedda Hopper, but there are a number of other supporting performances that really flesh things out and give depth and feeling to the people caught up in this turbulent period and how they reacted to it.  Diane Lane (Unfaithful, Under the Tuscan Sun) does a fine job as Cleo Trumbo, Dalton's quietly supportive but pushed-to-her-limits wife. Elle Fanning (Super 8, Maleficent) shines as the teenaged Niki Trumbo who chafes and ultimately rebels at the way her father's life has consumed everyone else's in the family, only for them both to realize that she's very much cut from the same stubborn moral mold as he is.  Veteran character actor John Goodman particularly stands out as B-movie producer Frank King who hired Trumbo to write for him - admittedly by using various fronts to cover the fact - when no one else would give him work.  Goodman delivers King in grand form, stealing every scene he's in and has some of the best scenes and lines in the film.  Dean O'Gorman (The Hobbit) does an excellent job portraying the actor Kirk Douglas who was instrumental in helping end the blacklist by openly giving Trumbo writing credit for his epic film Spartacus. And Christian Berkel (Inglourious Bastards, Downfall) does an equally excellent job as the imperious director Otto Preminger who was also instrumental in ending the blacklist by openly giving Trumbo writing credit for his film Exodus.

One exception to the overall fine performances however is Michael Stuhlbarg (Boardwalk Empire, A Serious Man) as Edward G. ""Eddie"" Robinson.  An otherwise fine actor, in Trumbo Stuhlbarg never came across believably as Robinson, in no small part because he completely lacked Robinson's highly distinctive voice and way of speaking, one of the best known and immediately recognizable voices in Hollywood history, even when not doing one of his much imitated gangster roles. Also unfortunately for Stuhlbarg, the script was highly unfair to Robinson as it had him naming names before HUAC, something the real-life Edward G. Robinson never did.  Another problem comes from  two composite characters, both of whom came across as overdone.  Louis C.K. (Louie) plays a screenwriter named Arlen Hird, a more ideological and committed communist in contrast to Trumbo's socially conscious one, and Roger Bart (Desperate Housewives) plays an opportunistic producer named Buddy Ross who caves under pressure to the blacklist.  There was no need for composite characters when so many real-life figures were available to use, and as written these characters seem to exist solely to spout dialogue and feel distinctly out of place among all of the real-life people being portrayed in the film.

On the plus side, Trumbo makes effective use of actual film footage and radio recordings from the period of statements and testimonies given by major Hollywood and political figures on both sides, from the infamous Senator Joe McCarthy and Ronald Reagan when he was president of the Screen Actors Guild to Lucille Ball, Gregory Peck and JFK.

Highly recommended for its outstanding performances and for bringing to the screen what it was like for people who were blacklisted during that shameful period of American history.",1451260800,11,5956,5.114315139031926
7456697,5,B0167IE0KY,"Saw this at the theater.  I will get it on blue ray when it is released.  It is a great movie, I read the Bruce Cook book that it was made from and there are quite a few specific changes to make the movie flow better, but none of them really changes the underlying truth of the movie.  I suspect that all the people who were being portrayed would be alright with it, after all they were movie people.  Kirk Douglas likes it, I think he may be the only one still alive.

I have read a lot about the period, and when I was in law school I was able to meet some of the people who represented those who were black listed at NLG conventions.

Cranston is very good as Trumbo.  He shows the guys essential decency is his driving force, but at the same time how overbearing the guy can be and how self righteous and yet how in the end he seemed to come to a more nuanced understanding of what happened.  Helen Mirron is the perfect villain as Hedda Hopper, she has to stand in for a lot of other people and she does a great job of it.  John Goodman is wonderful as one of the King brothers, three brothers (two in the movie) who produced schlock and were willing to give Trumbo and his friends jobs  at the worst point knowing what they believe in and still willing to do it.

I do like the fact that Trumbo is presented as a Communist and there is not white washing of that.  Further, it is an major statement about how important free speech is.  Something we need right about now.  It shows just how quickly all these freedoms can be taken away, even in a democracy and it does so entertainingly.

So the movie is both very entertaining and, I think, important.  Watch it.",1449964800,4,1667,4.1625

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

The dictionary tells us that a hagiography is any biography that idealizes or idolizes its subject. By definition, a hagiography is an inferior form of literature because it focuses on only the purported good side of its subjectthose looking for any kind of nuance will inevitably be disappointed.

As director Jay Roach and his scenarists would have it, Dalton Trumbo, the acclaimed Hollywood screenwriter, was a veritable saint for sticking to his conscience and not naming names before HUAC (House of Un-American Activities Committee) in 1947.

The rest of Trumbo basically follows the facts of what happened to him after he was blacklisted: a 10 month stint in a Federal prison for contempt of Congress; supporting himself by writing and/or editing screenplays under pseudonyms; winning two Academy Awards for best screenplay while concealing his identity; becoming addicted to prescription medication in order to be able to churn out such a voluminous amount of work; the difficulties he had with his wife and children due to the slavish devotion to his work; and his eventual triumph over the blacklist after director Otto Preminger and actor Kirk Douglas agree to give him credit as screenwriter for their movies.

There is really only one scene in the film (the best one!) which suggests maybe Trumbo wasn't the saint most of whom liberal America now believes him to be. That scene involves the meeting between famed actor Edward G. Robinson and Trumbo after Robinson has named names before HUAC. Robinson exposes Trumbo's self-righteousness after pointing out that Trumbo could still support himself by writing under other peoples' names, while he, as an actor, had no anonymity and hence had no choice but to ""name names.""

Director Roach would like us to believe that Trumbo was a political innocent. The only scene where he deals with Trumbo's political beliefs is when he has Trumbo speaking with his young daughter about Communism while horseback riding. Trumbo's definition is basically that Communism has to do with ""sharing"" and hence helping others.

The reality of Trumbo's political beliefs is much more complex than what director Roach and his crew let on here. Robert Radosh, in his most informative article, ""Red Star Falling: The Trumbo Train Wreck,"" informs that Trumbo due to his support of Stalin, was an isolationist before the war. His anti-war novel, ""Johnny Got His Gun,"" was published in the Daily Worker but after the dissolution of the Nazi-Soviet pact in 1941, Trumbo immediately had the book withdrawn from circulation. He even went to the FBI as Radosh tell us and gave them the names of people who had inquired about the book (later of course Trumbo had no problem condemning those who named names before HUAC).

Trumbo insisted that he was motivated by free speech but according to Radosh, he ""used his power in the film community to prevent proposed anti-Communist films from being made."" He called Stalin ""one of the democratic leaders of the world,"" and tried to prevent a film based on Trotsky's biography of Stalin as well as other anti-Communist films which he considered """"untrue and reactionary.""

Radosh has no illusions about HUAC's tactics but also decries the Hollywood Ten's true political character. Writing in 1991 in the American Spectator, Radosh reviewed the newly released film about the blacklist, ""Guilty by Suspicion"": ""HUAC's hearings were clearly punitive--their 1951 investigations turned up nothing, and were meant to force recalcitrant witnesses to engage in a humiliating game of contrition by offering the Committee names it already had. Only the contrite could gain absolution, and the proof was to confess one's sins. But in reality, most of those brought before HUAC were ardent Stalinists or fellow travelers, whose own record of politics was hardly that of moral propriety. They were unfairly treated and punished, but they were not without their own degree of sin.""

Radosh quotes the left-leaning author Larry Ceplair from his book ""The Inquisition in Hollywood,"" about the Hollywood Ten and their ilk who ""defended the Stalinist regime, accepted the Comintern's policies and about-faces, and criticized enemies and allies alike with infuriating self-righteousness, superiority, and selective memory which eventually alienated all but the staunchest fellow travelers.""

For those who would argue that Trumbo's views had evolved after World War II, Allan Ryskind writing in the NY Post reminds us that he was still an unrepentant Stalinist even at the time the Korean War broke out. Ryskind informs, ""Channeling his inner Stalin, he also wrote a screenplay  egged on by some of his Hollywood Ten friends  in which the major character, Catherine Bonham, reveals her ardent attachment to North Korea. Bonham insists Kim's country is a ""model"" Asian nation and is fighting for its freedom ""just as we had to fight for our own independence in 1776.""

Trumbo quit the Communist Party in 1956. While working on a book about the blacklist, Robert Radosh found an unpublished 1958 letter by Trumbo. In it he finally admits that ""the Ten did not ""perform historic deeds,"" but took part ""in a circus orchestrated by Communist Party lawyers, all to save ourselves from punishment."" Trumbo went even further: ""They lived in the United States, not Stalin's U.S.S.R., and should have openly proclaimed their views and membership so that the American people could judge them for what they believed.""

In his speech to the Screen Writer's Guild in 1970, Trumbo claimed no one was without sin during the days of the blacklist. It's a shame that this new biopic failed to provide an ample catalog of Trumbo's own sins. While Bryan Cranston does a fine job in depicting one side of Trumbo as the lovable curmudgeon, his more complex political views along with those of his ""fellow travelers,"" are whitewashed and soft-pedaled. The despicable acts of HUAC and their supporters doesn't excuse perfidy on the left as well, which Trumbo only owned up to in his later days and in limited fashion.",1449360000,17,6112,5.122489959839357
7456699,4,B0167IE0KY,"""Trumbo"" (2015 release; 124 min.) is a bio-pic about Hollywood screenwriter Dalton Trumbo. As the movie opens, we are informed it is ""1947, North of Los Angeles"", and we get to know Trumbo, a loud and proud member of the Communist Party, as we see him arguing with Edward G. Robinson on the set of a movie. One of Trumbo's friends observes: ""you talk like a radical but you live like a rich guy!"", overlooking the Tumbo estate. But it is not long, though, before a wave of anti-communism washes over Hollywood (and the rest of the country), and before we know it, Trumbo and the rest of ""the Hollywood 10"" find themselves blacklisted. How will Trumbo handle it? what about his family? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Jay Roach, better known for comedies--he directed the Austin Power movies as well as ""Meet the Parents"" and its sequels. Here Roach takes on a very different topic, namely how Hollywood (mis)treated a number of people simply on the believe they were communists. This is of course not the first movie to look at that shameful episode, but this time we get it served up in a very personal manner, namely how it affected one of Hollywood's great screenwriters, eventually resorting to using various aliases so as to be able to survive and provide for his family (""the blacklist is alive and well, and so is the black market!"", quips Trumbo). Bryan Cranston, best known for his TV role in ""Breaking Bad"", plays the role of his life as Dalton Trumbo, and I'm guessing he's going to get rewarded handsomely for this performance in the upcoming awards season. There are a number of other noteworthy performances, including Diane Lane as his wife, a remarkable Elle Fanning as his teenage daughter Nicola, and last but certainly not least Helen Mirren as the venomous Hollywood gossip columnist Hedda Hopper. The production of the movie is a marvel to watch, down to the last details. There is also a nice orchestral score from Theodore Shapiro to top it all off. Bottom line: this is a terrific look at one of Hollywood's greats as well as a sharp reminder of a dark episode in Hollywood's history.

""Trumbo"" expanded nationwide over the Thanksgiving holiday. The early evening screening where I saw this at in Ft. Myers, FL, was attended okay but not nearly as well as I had expected it. Not sure that this movie can attract the necessary numbers to make this a commercial success much beyond the art-house theater circuit. Regardless, I found this to be an engaging movie from start to finish, with some outstanding performances to boot. ""Trumbo"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1448668800,42,2722,4.7405063291139244
7456700,5,B0167IE0KY,"This is am AMAZING movie!!! Oscar worthy. Bryan Cranston IS Trumbo and deserves the Oscar. Helen Mirren is incredible. John Goodman and Louis CK are treasures. Everyone in this movie is a gem. John McNamara wrote a wonderful script and Jay Roach made such a beautiful picture. I have seen it a few times and it get's even better each time, which is remarkable.  It is an important part of history that needs to be told, and a great tribute to Dalton Trumbo and Bruce Cook's biography.",1448409600,5,484,4.563218390804598
7456701,4,B0167IE0KY,"Will there ever be enough movies about the Cold War? Hollywood is absolutely fascinated by the era, but they've notably been less fascinated exploring one of the darkest chapters in showbiz history. The reality of the Cold War wasn't just increased tensions between the U.S. and Russia; it was also a time of unprecedented mistrust and scrutiny within our own borders. Hollywood wasn't exempt, either, and often seemed like the epicenter of the Communist witch hunt that destroyed lives and careers. One of those who fought back against that injustice was blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, whose story is told in the surprisingly rousing and playful Trumbo.

""Rousing"" and ""playful"" may seem odd adjectives to describe such a time of intense paranoia, but Trumbo would probably be the first to crack a perfectly-worded witticism about his predicament. In fact he did, multiple times. When asked ""What's your position on the blacklist?"", he replied simply with, ""On it"". And that's the kind of tongue-in-cheek attitude taken by first-time screenwriter John McNamara and director Jay Roach, but most assuredly by Cranston who is clearly relishing his chance at a rare leading role.

Beginning in 1947, the film tracks Trumbo's life from the time he's investigated by the House Un-American Activities Committee, with accusations that he's a Communist. Well, he was. But so what? It wasn't illegal, and that's his general defense when the charges are levied against him. Of course that wasn't going to fly, not with anti-Red gossip columnist Hedda Hopper (Helen Mirren) exposing him and other big name screenwriters. Trumbo, whose personality is an unusual mix of elitist English professor and working-class dynamo, becomes the central figure of the blacklisted ""Hollywood Ten"", but keeps on writing under a pseudonym and completely undermines the entire system.

While the film has terrific momentum throughout, it's during Trumbo's underground screenwriting phase where it really takes off. Taking on the feel of a good heist movie, the film sees Trumbo assembling a colorful group of similarly banned and equally ideological writers to pen crappy B-movies for a rebellious producer played with gusto by John Goodman. McNamara, who wrote episodes of Lois & Clark: The Adventures of Superman previously, rattles of one snappy line of dialogue after another. The best are delivered by Cranston, Goodman, and Louis C.K. as grouchy screenwriter Arlen Hird, who acts as an edgier foil for Trumbo. If some of the shady characters like Hopper are painted as one-note villains, it's made up for by the nuance seen in Trumbo. Diane Lane plays his loyal wife, Cleo, while Elle Fanning is his spirited daughter, Nikola; both affected greatly by the weight of Trumbo's life hidden in the shadows. Trumbo, who is often seen neck deep in the bathtub puffing at a cigarette while hammering out a script, often becomes blinded by the war he's waging at the detriment of those around him. In one terrific scene, Cleo finally reminds him what's important; and in another we see what Nikola has learned about fighting the good fight.

Known mostly for broad comedies, Roach has taken a distinctly political path Recount, Game Change, and The Campaign, but Trumbo is easily the best film he's ever done. Of course he's helped by a top notch script and number of adept performances. Cranston's unforgettable run on Breaking Bad aside, he's never been afforded a role of such depth. He gets down to the essence of what makes Trumbo tick, capturing him as a father, an activist, a friend, and the angel on America's shoulder. If Trumbo tells us anything it's that Hollywood needs the occasional firebrand who isn't afraid to challenge the status quo. But what a toll that battle Trumbo fought took on him. What he went through wasn't for nothing, and Trumbo makes sure it won't be forgotten.",1448409600,7,3872,5.1025236593059935
7456702,5,B0167IE0KY,"Bryan Cranston leads an all star cast in a riveting portrayal of Dalton Trumbo, one of Hollywood's most talented and best known script writers and the efforts of the House of Un-Amercian Activity to purify Hollywood and protect the American viewing public from the communist menace of the early Cold War era. Trumbo was in fact a member of the communist party, along with many of his friends, and a leading activist in trade union activity in Hollywood, a fact of no particular interest during the WWII but politically and emotionally unacceptible after the war.  However, at no time was it ever actually illegal to be a member. Facts quickly become irrelevant and relegated to the background as the Congressional committe and like minded friends in Hollywood like John Wayne and Hedda Hopper try to drive out of Hollywood Trumbo, his friends and countless other people as the movie makes clear and deprive them of any ability to make a living.  Trumbo and his 9 friends were brought before the committee but refused to testify and were found in contempt of Congress, for which they all served time in Federal prison, although none were apparenty accused or convicted of any actual crime. Other close and similarly minded movie industry friends crumbled under the pressure to retain their status and income. But Trumbo and friends were just too talented for Hollywood to walk away from and continued to write under various ficitious names while biding their time to come out of the shadows once again.

The entire cast is brilliant,and lots of fun to watch. Bryan Cranston was born to play this role of the brilliant,highly talented and supremely egotistical Hollywood intellectual. It's impossible to take your eyes of him. Hellen Mirren as Hedda Hopper, the vicious and venemous Hollywood gossip writer leading the charge from the right has never been better. Lewis CK has brought his A game as well, but I'd have to say my favorite scene in the movie belongs entirely to John Goodman when he steps up to the plate. You'll know it when you see it.

This is great drama of an era when America succumbed to fear only to devour itself from within. It richly deserves to be remembered and not forgotten. But you'll find very few historical dramas that are so entertaining and downright fun while resurrecting such painful memories. It's a script that Dalton himself would have been proud to have written.",1448236800,156,2402,4.865525672371638
7456703,4,B0167IE0KY,"Remember blacklisting in 1947? Ten Hollywood professionals refused to testify to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC); as a result they were accused of having Communist sympathies. They were jailed and/or blacklisted from any future work.

Author Bruce Cook (""Dalton Trumbo"") has given us a humor-laced book that deserves to be immortalized. Dalton Trumbo (""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"" and ""Kitty Foyle"") entered that era as Hollywood's top screenwriter. By the time it was over.... well, you're just gonna have to see this movie...smile...

Director Jay Roach (""Meet the Parents""), working with John McNamara (Lots of TV), has assembled this cast:
* Bryan Cranston (""Breaking Bad"") is Dalton Trumbo, angry to be accused of being ""Un-American. We can see that the hearings are held in such a way that testimony from the accused is never heard. Trumbo is resourceful though and figures out how to survive.
* Diane Lane (""Man of Steel"") is his steadfast wife Cleo. She watches their lives disintegrate but stays the course.
* Louis C.K. (""Louie"") is Arlen Hird, another blacklisted screenwriter, chain smoking despite his lung cancer.
* Alan Tudyk (""Firefly"") Ian McLellan Hunter won an Oscar for the ""Roman Holiday"" screenplay, even though he didn't write it.
* Michael Stuhlbarg (""Steve Jobs"") is Edward G. Robinson, who can't work anonymously because his face is his profession. His response is shocking.
* James DuMont (""Jurassic World"") is J. Parnell Thomas, who conducts the initial hearings and then later crosses paths with Trumbo again, much to his surprise.
* David James Elliott (""Mad Men"") is John Wayne, whose persona as a lover of America doesn't seem to jibe with his service during WWII. Elliott doesn't LOOK like, Wayne, but he sure SOUNDS like him.
* Helen Mirren (""Woman in Gold"") is Hedda Hopper, the powerful gossip columnist who is determined to destroy the careers of the accused men. She is smart enough to smell a rat when ""The Brave One"" by an unknown screenwriter wins an Oscar.
* Dean O'Gorman (""The Hobbit"") Kirk Douglas is furious at Hopper. As a result he did something which I still respect today.
* Adewale Akinnuooye-Agbaje (""Pompeii"") is excellent as Virgil Brooks, the felon who becomes Trumbo's boss in prison.
* Kudos to Casting Agent David Rubin for his excellent work. He brings us actors portraying Frank King, Otto Preminger, Louis B. Mayer, and dozens of others. This is a star-studded cast.

The generous use of old newsreels and film clips with our cast integrated into some of them (notice the gladiatorial scene from ""Spartacus!"") makes everything seem authentic, as does the incessant smoking (even in movie theaters!) and the steady intake of controlled substances.

Once again, Cranston turns in an award-worthy performance, as does Louis C.K. I had never pictured him as a dramatic actor but I have changed my mind. This excellent film works as a nicely biased history lesson about Hollywood and politics, AND it entertains as well.",1447200000,9,2993,5.1020408163265305
7456704,1,B0167IE0KY,"As Sonny Bunch stated in the Daily Beast in November of 2015, Blacklisting was and is a terrible thingbut we do a disservice to history when we unthinkingly celebrate Stalinists as heroes.

One of the weaknesses of Trumbo, the hagiographic new film starring Bryan Cranston as blacklisted communist screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, is that it never grapples with what it meant to belong to a political party funded by an unfriendly foreign power committing atrocities on an unimaginably horrifying scale. While we can agree that blacklisting was a dark period in our history, its also worth looking at the people and policies Trumbo and his fellow American communists supported before we hold them up as heroesand before we condemn those who named names as spineless, craven cowards.

The films explication of Trumbos own commitment to communism is literally childish. After his daughter asks whether or not hes a commie, Trumbo sagely launches into a spiel about how communism is just like sharing ones lunch with a hungry classmate at school. Taken solely as a piece of writing, the speech is cringe-inducing, pedantic. However, the deployment of such a metaphor on behalf of communism is amusingly and darkly ironic given what we know of the engineered starvations presided over by his partys leaders.

The use of famine as a weapon of the state against the populace is generally considered to be a Stalinist innovation, Martin Amis notes in Koba the Dread: Laughter and the Twenty Million. But Lenins famine of 1921-22 had its terroristic aspects. Both famines had the same cause: punitive food-requisitioning. The Bolsheviks had little interest in providing food to the hungry; indeed, they deployed hunger as a weapon. That being said, Trumbos ignorance of the Soviet policy of starving the peasantry to death is understandable, given Stalins predilection for executing those who bought it upor those census takers who found that Russias population figures were suffering as a result of collectivization.

Its hard to say how closely tied Trumbo was to the Communist Party. When he marched alongside Communists, it was never as an apparatchik, an automaton, or a robotic follower of dogma, Larry Ceplair writes in the introduction to Dalton Trumbo: Blacklisted Hollywood Radical. His critics fail to understand that the redness of Trumbos ideas, at any particular time, must be carefully analyzed and that Trumbos Communist Party membership was only a small part of a much larger life.

Allan H. Ryskind, the author of Hollywood Traitors: Blacklisted ScreenwritersAgents of Stalin, Allies of Hitler would vehemently disagree with this assessment. In his book he highlighted the pro-Soviet messages inserted into the Writers Guilds magazine, The Screen Writer, under Trumbos watch and noted his long service to the cause.

So far as Moscow was concerned, Trumbo, though he sold the Party line with zest, wit, and imagination, was for years a stolid Communist conformist, Ryskind writes. There appeared to be no corkscrew twist in the Soviet line he wouldnt embrace.

The truth probably lies somewhere in the middle; I doubt Dalton was getting telegrams from Uncle Joe. But it is interesting to look at Trumbos actions, rather than his words, to see just how closely he was hewing to the Communist line at any given time. And one item that jumps out is the publication history of Johnny Got His Gun, Trumbos antiwar novel.

As Thomas Patrick Doherty notes in Hollywood and Hitler, 1933-1939, support for Communist front groups began drying up after the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact required them to lay off the Nazis. The Germans and Soviets were now allies who would soon carve up Poland together, and that meant Trumbo and his fellow travelers had to embrace an anti-war and tacitly pro-fascist party line.

Only party discipline and an eye for the big picture kept the true believers in line, Doherty writes of the book that was also serialized in The Daily Worker. The screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, a dutiful party liner, published an antiwar novel, Johnny Got His Gun, about a young American doughboy from the Great War, his face, arms, and legs blown off, who pleads in Morse code to be put on exhibit as a warning to future generations.

But a funny thing happened after Hitler turned on Stalin a few years later and the Communists desperately sought American entry into the war: Trumbo suddenly become much less committed to pacifism. And, after receiving letters from non-interventionists who thought the book was needed now more than ever, Trumbo let it go out of print.

Nothing could have convinced me so quickly that Johnny was exactly the sort of book that shouldnt be reprinted until the war was at an end, he wrote in an introduction to the novel dated March 25, 1959. The publishers agreed.

More fascinating than Trumbos willingness to sacrifice royalties for the good of the Party, though, is the little tidbit that follows: At the insistence of friends who felt my correspondents efforts could adversely affect the war effort, I foolishly reported their activities to the F.B.I. Dalton Trumbo, it turns out, was himself a namer of names.

Or maybe Trumbo was a patriot stirred to action after Pearl Harbor. These things are complicated. The point is, when one knows about Trumbos own history of playing stool pigeon for the feds, one cant help but laugh at the scene in Trumbo in which Dalton huffily denounces Edward G. Robinson (played by Michael Stuhlbarg) for naming names, including Trumbos own, to the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC).

Robinsons story is a sad onea liberal but not a Communist, he was still made to sufferand a reminder that things aren't quite as black and white as Trumbo would have us believe. HUAC and the Hollywood Ten have been reduced to figures in a morality play, one where naming names is bad and clamming up about Communists good.

One shudders to think of how Hollywood would handle the story of Elia Kazan, the brilliant director who earned the enmity of a generation of leftists for testifying in front of HUAC. As Richard Schickel notes in his biography of Kazan, the director did so not because he was a coward worried about finding work but because he did not care for the Soviet-funded Communist Partys interference in the work of his theater company.

Eventually Kazan was offered a stark choice: between his loyalty to the Group at large or to its Communist faction, Schickel writes. The feisty Kazan was unimpressed. Like many another artist and intellectual in this period, he simply would not tolerate this failing gods interference with his work. Trumbo, its safe to say, had a different set of concerns.

Yes, theres no excuse for the blacklisting of communists by Hollywood in the 1940s and 1950s. Just as Scott Eckern, Orson Scott Card, and Brendan Eich should not be deprived of their livelihood for their political viewsand those on the right should think twice before launching a boycott of Quentin Tarantino for his recent comments about policethe Hollywood Ten and other Communists should not have been shut out of the studio system for arguing in favor of an unpopular ideology.

But it wasn't just an unpopular ideology that Dalton Trumbo and his fellow blacklistees were supporting with their membership in the Communist Party: They were backing Stalin and a murderous, totalitarian regime dedicated to bringing America into the Communist fold.

In the 1930's many joined the Communist Party during the Great Depression and the rise of Fascism. So too during WW II. The Cold War created suspicion of American Communists. This story begins in 1947 near Los Angeles. Trumbo wrote a novel and for movie pictures. There is a Hollywood party, Trumbo is there. There is a news film about a strike. A Congressman talks about subversives. A man insults Trumbo. Is he a dangerous radical? Does sharing a sandwich have political meaning? John Wayne speaks to an audience about his love for America. Wayne says its a new day. Trumbo is offered a contract with MGM, he writes happy endings. Trumbo receives a subpoena to testify in Washington about Communists in Hollywood. Trumbo bets any conviction will be reverseed by the Supreme Court. Will he risk his wealthy life?

Trumbo is questioned by a subcommittee. They want a yes or no answer. One man has lung cancer. The Hollywood Ten are charged with contempt. Hedda Hopper talks t a movie manager. The Hollywood Ten are fired in spite of contracts. They have a defense fund. Trumbo is found guilty of contempt. Can he find work? Should a writer cooperate and name his friends? Trumbo continues to write scripts for others to claim credit. A Supreme Court Justice died, his affects their appeal. Trumbo says goodbye to his children as he goes to prison. He gets a job in supply. J. Parnell Roberts is also in prison for tax evasion. The prisoners watch a movie. One write testifies he was duped and names names.

There are news films about Senator Joe McCarthy. Trumbo is released from prison and returns home. Trumbo finds work writing anonymously as a script doctor. A man doesnt like his neighbors. Trumbo develops his business while working at home. He works hard at night. One script needs a revision. Is it art? One writer asks Trumbo for help with a script. Is he working too hard now? One writer tells about his past. Trumbos actions affect his family. Producer King is threatened by a lobby; he reacts. The Brave One is hit for Robert Rich. Kirk Douglas has a script, Spartacus. Stripling from the HUAC questions Douglas. Otto Preminger visits Trumbo to talk about Exodus. Trumbo is interviewed for television about the blacklist. Trumbo gets credit for Spartacus, the film is picketed. President Kennedy praised the movie. The Writers Guild gives him an award in 1970. Trumbo speaks about the blacklist.

This is based on the book by Bruce Cook. It starts out good but declines in drama around the half-way mark. That Hollywood gossip columnist worked for the Hearst Press and did not go against her employers policies. Trumbo wrote the script for the 1974 movie Executive Action. Yes, Congress has the right to investigate whatever they think needs it. Its part of their legislative powers. Can they violate Constitutional rights too? Maybe, it all depends on what the Supreme Court may decide at a point in time.",1519430400,,2937,4.798418972332016

Bryan Cranston shines in the role of Trumbo!

The movie is slow and I found myself nodding off on a couple of occasions. However, I kept going because I wanted to see if there was any bias at all in the ""true"" story adaptation of the book. What I found is Hollywood's propaganda machine rolling out more of its bs, telling only part of the story. And, I found myself wondering throughout, what were they complaining about Capitalism all the while they were getting rich because of it! Were they willing to redistribute their money to the masses or is that just for the rest of us peons? Today, they (Hollywood) are blacklisting those in the industry who aren't standing against our President. Same old story different decade! Hollywood thinks they run the country. The blacklisting by the government, the McCarthyism, was wrong back then and what is happening today, coming from the ANTIFA Hollywood crowd, is just as wrong!",1501891200,,1055,4.739130434782608

A well done reminder how easily abuse of political and police power can ruin the lives of decent people for many years and an example of a man who would not go down even under the most intense pressure.

7456734,2,B0167IE0KY,"Trumbo & the Hollywood 10 were card carrying Communists. Communists in the 1930's were killing their countrymen by the millions & stealing their property. The Communists were killing innocents in Poland and Hungary and elsewhere for decades. Khrushchev disclosed the horrors of Stalin's regime publicly in 1956. Trumbo & other commies supported the union thugs that were beating up innocent people all over the Hollywood lots. The CPUSA on orders from Moscow called the shots on scripts these supposedly talented writers were writing-case in point Mission to Moscow, a puff piece glorifying the Soviets. The Rosenberg's were guilty of treason for passing nuclear secrets to the Soviets based on a documentary by their own
granddaughter & brother in law. So there are some relevant points left out of the movie. Maybe being a communist isn't such a good thing. There were certainly many writers in Hollywood- why not hire some that weren't Communists? Maybe the film producers had a point there. There were some Communist writers in Hollywood who rebelled against being told what to write in their scripts by Communists- seems they should be the ones honored. Yves  Montand was one who was sympathetic to the Hollywood Ten but by 1990 he admitted publicly that he was idiot for believing the commie propaganda. He was not alone. Maybe those who fought off the Reds in the US should be honored. Maybe Trumbo & others would be more worthy of honor if they had spoken out about there communist membership. Instead they snuck around in the dark using false names to make money.",1500336000,,1572,4.977186311787072
7456735,4,B0167IE0KY,"An insider's perspective of the red scare, following the private trials and public persecutions of Oscar-winning screenwriter (and proud communist) Dalton Trumbo. It's one-sided, as you might expect, but serves as an intriguing glimpse into the might of effective media manipulation and its powerful ability to turn the tide of popular perception. Bryan Cranston plays the lead, and though he doesn't look all that much like the man behind the thick glasses and dense moustache, his intense, passionate self-defense and gravel-voiced delivery are impressive and convincing all the same. Louis CK, in an important supporting role, is less successful: he touches the necessary emotional points, but doesn't threaten to disappear into the part. He's just... Louis CK in a different set of clothes. One part historical essay and one part chilling cautionary tale, its message is particularly pertinent now, amid the nonstop spin and opinionated delivery of the modern-day news cycle. In time, Hollywood recognized its blacklist for the thin, short-sighted witch hunt it really was, but not before countless lives had been sacrificed in the name of some mythical greater good. What will we look back upon with similar regret tomorrow?",1500336000,,1229,5.40625

7456741,3,B0167IE0KY,"Rating this movie was fairly difficult. I give it a 1 or 2 rating for the first half of the movie, but this movie was just boring for the most part, too simplistic, characters one-dimensional, it is close to being so flat, I barely could get through it. Oh it had its moments, oh I laughed really hard when Trumbo was put in his place by the black inmate, when he was in prison. I read lots of reviews, and I mostly agree with those 1 star ratings. I did not give it a 1, because Brian Cranston gave a really good performance and it picked up about half of the way through the movie, but his performance cannot overcome poor script writing that made characters one dimensional. I also thought actors appeared smug.
The time period for this movie started about 7 years before I was born so I did not have a personal history to balance this movie for historical accuracy. I have never been a fan of the morons behind the House committee on un-American activities. Curious but never explained in Trumbo as to why did not anyone-The Hollywood Ten- that got sentenced to prison as to why they pleaded the first amendment but not the fifth. The only part of the movie I liked besides the black prisoner scene, was when he became an underground writer for various producers, found it ironic that he became a particularly good capitalist, and more human... oh he, Trumbo did act like a jerk to his daughter on her birthday.
I just had high hopes for this movie, I only got interested towards the end, and for me it did not deliver overall. A 3 rating says OK, but its how you would say OK, it is more like O-kay, with the sound tapering off as you say the word, with OK really meaning mediocre. A 5 star rating by most reviewers, oh that is a laugh.",1497657600,2,1741,4.327217125382263

Dalton Trumbo was a fairly successful screenwriter in Hollywood then the war and the McCarthy hearings hit leading to many people who were suspected Communists having their lives and careers ruined. Its always an interesting paradox for me: the line between art and politics and how it changes based on the politics of the time and war situations.

Getting to the movie itself, Bryan Cranston drove the wheels off the car as Dalton Trumbo. I felt his desperation, his resolve, his courage, whatever emotion he was feeling at the time bled through the screen and onto me. While he is backed up by a solid supporting cast, Cranston as Trumbo is the headliner and through sure force of character makes the viewer ponder these deep questions like Where does the line between art and ones political views meet and when is it crossed? Is geopolitics a meaningful rationale for censorship?

Every character on the ""dark side"" feels like they're doing the right thing, or if not, that their hands are forced. Every ""good guy"" is severely curtailed, or jailed, or dies. Cranston's Trumbo keeps his family alive by starting an alcohol-tobacco-bennie-fueled underground screenplay production line, grinding out cheapo quickie flicks and Oscar winners behind others' names. Almost looks like he had a better time in prison than out. The empathy deficit seems to be as implacable in society as behind bars. Anyone who survives is scarred. Very current stuff. Makes me wonder why people get so caught up in the conspiracy of fear. It's always so much more rewarding to believe the best in people.",1485820800,,763,5.063492063492063

7456909,4,B0167IE0KY,I really enjoyed this movie.  It gave me a more personal appreciation of how the black listing of writers ruined so many writers' lives simply because they were communists or suspected of communism.

7457023,5,B0167IE0KY,"Bryan Cranston does a great job portraying a real life character in this film.  At first, the character seemed so over-the-top in some ways that I thought the story unbelievable.  For example, writing in the bathtub using a typewriter.  But in the closing credits you see actual pictures of the real people in some of the situations portrayed in the film.  I guess that truth is stranger than fiction.

The film is far more interesting than a documentary would be.  There are well developed dramatic conflicts and strong female characters.  Yet, the film definitely serves an educational purpose for those of us who either weren't around in the Hollywood blacklist days or who were simply unaware of the persecution these people had to endure.

One cannot help but see this as a cautionary tale.",1484697600,,795,4.880597014925373

Terrific acting on the part of Bryan Cranston, Diane Lane and Helen Mirren.......and all the secondary players who took the parts of famous writers, directors and actors. It was amazing how each of these actors began to look like the people they were portraying. And there was a lot of unknown background information on various Hollywood celebrities.

I was so taken with the movie, I convinced my husband to watch it and I watched it again with him. It was evety bit as powerful the second time as the first.

7457078,4,B0167IE0KY,"Bryan Cranston  demonstrates again why he is one of the great contemporary actors with an ability to disappear into a role so completely that it's hard to believe that this is the same actor who was Walter White or Lyndon Johnson.  Here he carries off the always-difficult feat of making a guy sitting at a typewriter an interesting enough character to keep us watching. Although the melodrama is laid on a little thick, the supporting cast is good enough--especially pre-weight-loss John Goodman as a shlock-film producer who hires the blacklisted Trumbo to churn out ""B"" movie scripts--to keep us awake when Cranston is not on the screen.  Among the other impersonations of historical figures (John Wayne, Kirk Douglas, Louis B. Mayer etc.) Helen Mirren delivers a delightfully nasty Hedda Hopper, complete with hats just this side of farcical. The film is a good reminder, as we prepare for the ascension to power of the American Berlusconi, of how easily the political freedoms we take for granted can be lost or compromised by repression masquerading as patriotism.",1484352000,,1070,5.068181818181818

7457109,5,B0167IE0KY,"This film is set during one of the scariest periods of US history, a period when screen writers and actors were subpoened to testify before the Committee on Unamerican Activities.  They were all asked the same question, ""Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the Communist Party?"".  Those that refused to answer were held in contempt and jailed.  One of those was Trumbo.  Upon his release, he was blackballed by Hollywood.  In theory he was deprived of his livelihood.  He got round it by publishing his work under a pseudonym, but he was paid peanuts.

For over fifteen years Trumbo, and others, were unable to publish under their own names.  They lived precariously.  Finally, in the late 60's, Otto Preminger asked Trumbo to write a screenplay for which Preminger promised to give Trumbo credit.  And so it was.  Gradually, those on the blacklist were able to work again.

Those who cooperated with the Committee on Unamerican Activities were seen as patriots by the right (John Wayne, et al), but were considered traitors by those who refused to cooperate.  This produced a bitter rift between the two sides; a rift which still exists today.",1484092800,,1156,4.807106598984771

7457140,5,B0167IE0KY,"The actor who portrayed Trumbo was really very good.  This picture shows just how far the ""man's inhumanity to man"" syndrome can go even against people who would ordinarily be very much admired.  I'm glad that Trumbo showed perserverance upon his release from jail (which is a disgrace that he was ever even jailed for this).  He emerged the victor, with Oscars!.  One miscast in my opinion, was of the actor who played Edward G. Robinson.  Maybe it was because the portrayal seemed so different from the Edward G movie goers know; even though I have heard he was a soft spoken, cultured art collector in real life.  Also, even an Edward G Robinson would appear frightened and humble with all those hornets going against him.  I was also surprised to see Diane Ladd in such a small, timid role as Trumbo's devoted wife, Cleo.  The show stealer, of course, was the great Helen Mirren who brilliantly portrayed the repulsive Hedda Hopper.  Many today would not be interested in this movie, but I found it somewhat timely considering the political cahos we are living through today.",1484006400,,1079,4.758064516129032

A great story of the blacklist in the 1950's that victimized hundreds, if not thousands of people, in the film industry by blacklisting them from employment just because the government was on a witch hunt. Starts off a little slow but keep watching as the story blossoms into a formidable story of a man and his personal mission ... as Dalton Trumbo creates a successful black market for ghost screen writers.  It's a great peak into what can happen when the government gets over zealous and a sneak peak into early film making when we see a young Kirk Douglas in his star roll as Spartacus (1960) which was the beginning of the end of the blacklist era.

Add enough fear and doubt and those who want to scapegoat for the purpose of controlling how others think and talk and act can easily be swept back to power.

Bryan Cranston had an excellent cast surrounding his stellar performance to combine for an magnificent tribute to Dalton Trumbo. Please refer to Yates v. United States, 354 U.S. 298 (1957) and Noto v. United States, 367 U.S. 290 (1961) in order to understand the Smith Act [The Alien Registration Act of 1940 (Smith Act)] and the protections of the US Constitution. As for Trumbo, he served time for contempt of Congress.

7457364,5,B0167IE0KY,Insightful information delivered in a serious but entertaining manner.  I had no idea about Trumbo himself because his work was attributed to other names.  Treatment of him and others was a disgrace in the history of USA.  Hopefully it does not foreshadow times to come.  Everyone should watch this.,1483056000,,299,5.040816326530612

7457367,4,B0167IE0KY,"Very well done and insightful into an inciteful, fearful time. Cranston is really excellent and I found the script pretty tight and authentic. This is an interesting film about the red scare era and would appeal to film fans and anyone else interested in social justice, Hollywood 10 and how fear can produce hysteria and injustice. Helen Mirren also delivers a perfect characterization of a self-righteous, powerful bigot. Excellent retrospective illuminating one of the darkest, most shameful times in American history, and one of the keymost creative artists who suffered at the hands of fear-driven fanatics. TRUMBO serves as an applicable reminder of how fear and distrust can spiral into labeling human beings and Trumscapegoating, with its historically ruinous results. A mirror on an old scar, marring us just decades ago, that we would be wise to reflect on in America today.",1482969600,,884,5.232394366197183
7457368,1,B0167IE0KY,Utterly pallid. Overacted and emotionless. (CK does a good job finding space for a touch of humor in an otherwise stiff script of overdrawn characters). Leaves you feeling like you've watched a bad version of an after school special.,1482969600,2,233,5.0

7457372,4,B0167IE0KY,Bryan Cranston is a very good actor. Strong performances by all. I knew a bit about this period but I still found this movie very interesting. I didn't know what part Kirk Douglas played in this history. That made me think a lot more of him.,1482969600,,241,4.260869565217392

Character struggles are episodic, characters are single-dimensional, the story choppy. It is almost as if the movie were written to be presented in stand-alone chapters.

Is it a good historical reminder of the harm that demonization of a set of people and its propagation by the media and government can do to otherwise outstanding people? Yep.

It's a horrifying glimpse of a terrible moment in our history and of a man who is as interested in surviving as in winning the struggle.  For the sake of conflict, we have the usual hostile children, but that's par for the course.  The photography is terrific, the writing is crisp, the story is compelling, and the acting is first-rate.  Highly recommended.

It is an episodic collection of scenes with little connective flow and (important!) no character development and *no narrative arc.* Surprised Jay Roach would turn in a movie this bland.

7457672,4,B0167IE0KY,"Great performances and smart dialogue round out this important story of a now almost forgotten period of time.  Although there are some historical inaccuracies and at least one fictionalized character, the soul of this story remains intact, and perhaps enhanced by the creative liberties that were taken.  Cranston is, not surprisingly, fantastic and most of the supporting cast who were tasked with playing icons such as John Wayne and E.G. Robinson do a capable job. Mirren is at her bitchy best as Hedda Hopper and Goodman gives one of the most memorable scenes in the film a lot of life.  Diane Lane is a fantastic actor who also did a great job, but she is really only given one scene to show her stuff, which she does with an understated grace.  But the standout to me was Louis CK.  Perhaps not quite an Oscar worthy performance, the writer and comedian shows that he has real acting chops, standing toe to toe with Cranston in a number of scenes as a sympathetic, complex and tragic screenwriter.

Given today's looming political climate, the subject matter alone makes this worth a watch.",1481241600,,1097,4.777777777777778

And that they  were reaction to and awareness of a profoundly changed family value and her personal expectation for her father. A moment of truth. Emotionally disturbing.

7457836,1,B0167IE0KY,"Before my opinion about this movie as a movie is revealed I say this; I find it deplorable how Trumbo and all who held the political ideology that he had were treated by the Government and by other so called patriots of the day. The fervor and stirred up by the House Un-American Activities Committee and by Senator Joseph McCarthy was despicable. Acting like communists they accused communists of being un-American.  This is not a bit different than what is happening today although the pendulum has swung to the other side. This is the redeeming factor in this movie. Today the so-called tolerant leftists, the so called politically correct are doing the same thing to those who they disagree with. Voices are again being shut down on campuses, in the news rooms of all major media and diversity of opinion is no more. Only those who agree with the leftist progressive are tolerated while the others, those who disagree are called intolerant. The sins deplored in this movie are being honed to a fine edge by Universities and media elite and by much of Hollywood.

Now to the movie as a movies. Outrageously boring! I finally gave up on watching the movie. It was so very self-serving and that  was the best thing about it. It created a hero out of an ordinary man with writing skills. Dialogue was so very trite and message heavy. It was like a crybaby making its feelings known.

Eugene McCarthy was an unknown Senator until he began spouting off and grabbing attention with his flimsy Communist at the gate claims, and ruined many innocent peoples' lives- hmmmm . Republican, but not like Eisenhower though, more like the fringe Eisenhower warned about- cough. John Wayne terrible actor, and really a giant sissy that just like McCarthy was all posing, no substance, never did like him or his boring movies delivered in his flat monotone voice. Heda Harper, well she made a living as a bitchy gossip on a power trip, so no surprise there about her.",1479168000,,641,5.056603773584905

I knew a little about the McCarthy era and blacklisted Hollywood personnel, but I was not aware of this particular screenwriter's life during that time.  He was quite impressive: a good husband, loved his children, and worked feverishly to to continue his work inspite of the roadblocks surrounding him.  Cranston was exceptional.",1479168000,,415,5.0588235294117645
7457848,4,B0167IE0KY,"Brilliantly acted about a dark period in history. Relevant to today and our current struggles with fear of our fellow Americans.  This movie is about the struggle of rights; specifically, the right to choose the best way to advocate for their beliefs-including being a member of the Communist party. This was at a high fear time right after WWII and the beginning of the Cold War. The protagonist of the movie is called before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, and refuses to answer questions that were felt to infringe upon his Constitutional rights. Trumbo is part of a group who are all called before the Committee, and become known as The Hollywood Ten. The movie portrays Dalton Trumbo as the genius behind the defense strategy (that goes horribly awry), who believes that The Ten's hope lies in their case being heard by the US Supreme Court. Once the plan goes off the rails, The Ten are taken to serve their sentences and when released find themselves blacklisted from working in Hollywood. Again, Trumbo is portrayed as the genius behind the stratagem that allows he and fellow blacklisters to work despite the blacklist banning them from working. In the end, all parties involved have their scars to bear, and Cranston (Trumbo) delivers a lovely speech from a humanistic perspective and states a belief that everyone suffers when fear prevents discourse.",1479168000,,1377,4.98695652173913

7457896,4,B0167IE0KY,"In today's environment, this is a movie that has a modern message and should be seen by everyone, especially those with a conservative outlook. Bryan Cranston is an underrated actor and as with most of his movies has done a terrific job. Strong supporting cast with a story that is historically accurate. It was great to see at the end of the movie credits actual pictures of Trumbo. The movie is also a testimony to Trumbo's character, who paid a very high price for standing up for his rights and the rights of others. A living example of true courage. One has to wonder, if living in those times how many of us would be able to have the courage demonstrated by Trumbo. Not only a testimony to his courage, but also his christian values. A great example of social responsibility, balancing work life with his family all while not caving in to pressure from the political right.  When all was said and done, here was a man who did not point the finger at his enemies or his friends or associates that took the easy road, some even responsible for his time in jail. A true genius, while out of work and when no one would hire him due to his political beliefs, he wrote several movie scripts under an alias that were nominated and won Academy awards. Then putting his friends who were also blacklisted to work writing scripts under different names. Trumbo a genius on many levels. It is interesting to see how John Wayne and Edward G Robinson are portrayed in the movie.",1478649600,,1469,4.50187265917603

Of the various movies made about HUAC, this is a solid ""in the middle."" I prefer ""Guilty by Suspicion"" (not only for the portrayal by Martin Scorcese of Sam Wanamaker) and ""The Front"" (because it actually had actors in it who were blacklisted, such as Zero Mostel and Herschel Bernardi).  Because it focuses on Dalton Trumbo, the film is primarily from his point of view.  I""d like to have seen a more complete denouement that showed not only what happened to him (which it does), but also what happened to those who were bent on his destruction (i.e., such as Hedda Hopper and Louis Mayer?). Still the film shows Trumbo as a great writer, crappy friend and family man (apparently), and as are a lot of artists, self-aborbed.  Bryan Cranston is fabulous, not quite up to the Everest of his performance in Breaking Bad (but then, where do you go from that peak?). Well worth a watch.

7458058,3,B0167IE0KY,"3 1/2 stars --  Mainline movies seem to have a hard time with the topic of this movie -- the era of blacklisting and fear of Communism in the late 1940's to the late1950's.  ""The Way We Were"" didn't take politics nearly seriously enough and left us with a tepid romance.  Here, in ""Trumbo,"" politics are more to the forefront, but a weak script (ironic, given Trumbo's talents as a writer of screenplays) means that it hardly rises above the engagement level of a sitcom.  That's not the fault of the actors -- aside, perhaps, from a miscast Louis C. K. -- and Bryan Cranston works hard to give some profile to Trumbo, but there's not enough meat on the bones.  Trumbo, in real life, was a screenwriter who was blacklisted because of his Communist ties (not, it must be said, ties to the Stalinist Soviet state), served almost a year in year in prison for contempt of Congress (in the shape of the House Unamerican Activities Committee [HUAC]), and returned to work as a screenwriter on low-budget B-movies under pseudonyms, until he was once again hired, thanks to Otto Preminger and Kirk Douglas, to write ""Exodus"" and ""Spartacus"" under his own name.  His persistence with B-movie work and with helping his blacklisted friends find similar work leads him to neglect his family, and he comes close to being a martyr, sacrificing his family life for the larger good (which includes feeding his family).

But as rendered here, it's all too tame.  The scene in which his wife, Cleo (Diane Lane) faces him down over his neglect is weakly written and passes over too quickly, a life-lesson too easily learned, as in sitcoms.  And it's a sitcom kind of satisfaction that we take in the movie's funniest scene, in which John Goodman, as the B-movie producer who gives Trumbo work, grabs a baseball bat when a boycott of his movies is threatened.  The scene that comes closest to real seriousness is the late confrontation between Trumbo and Edward G. Robinson (Michael Stuhlbarg).  The actor had originally been on the side of Trumbo and his friends but had buckled when faced himself with HUAC, some months after Trumbo's release from jail.  Robinson defends himself non-trivially, and Trumbo is given nothing to say in response.

Cranston's Trumbo affects a mannered speech of which he is amusedly and amusingly aware, but he's the sitcom ""good dad"" at heart.  Helen Mirren does her best with the flat characterization of the venomous Hedda Hopper, and Davis James Elliott does a good John Wayne impersonation, Dean O'Gorman is a dead ringer for the young Kirk Douglas, and Christian Berkel does his best with a caricatured Otto Preminger.  It's all very watchable, but it doesn't cut as deep as it should.",1477353600,,2702,4.793103448275862

7458152,5,B0167IE0KY,"At this moment, this is one of the best films I have ever seen due in large part to the cast, lead by Bryan Cranston in a role that could not be more different from Breaking Bad's Walter White. They transformed the book-inspired script into a work that is both believable and personal. It was marvelous to watch.

The time of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee (HUAC) hearings and the Hollywood blacklist is both historically significant and often misunderstood. This film will likely not change many minds on the topic but it does some very important things. It lifts the curtain slightly on the politics of the day both within Washington D.C. and in the film industry. Then as now they were both agenda-driven but over time the agendas have changed. To be clear, this film does not take a political stance beyond showing the damage done by both to the lives of people in the film industry that were generally minding their own business. It is a strong statement about rights and freedoms, especially the 1st Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

It also both a story that shows the failure of corruption and the redemption of hard work, freedom of thought and speech, and love. Key characters are Cleo (Diane Lane), his spouse and children. From the film industry, John Wayne, Hedda Hopper, Edward G. Robinson, Kirk Douglas and B-movie producer Frank King were pivotal influences over the course of Trumbo's blacklist years. And while David James Elliot's portrayal of Wayne fell short, the performances of Dean O'Gorman as Douglas and Helen Mirren as Hopper were deeply convincing.

For anyone wanting to watch a great story told well, Trumbo is a much-watch film. That it is based in fact and set amidst the threats of communism and how that affected mid-century America makes it important as well.",1476576000,,1808,4.863636363636363
7458153,5,B0167IE0KY,Wonderful in-depth look at an ugly part of history.  Brian Cranston was terrific.,1476576000,,81,5.230769230769231
7458154,3,B0167IE0KY,Interesting and important subject matter but slow in some spots and some characters a bit cartoonish. Most compelling was the footage of the real Trumbo.,1476576000,,153,5.16
7458155,4,B0167IE0KY,"While we don't really get to know any other character as well as Mr. Trumbo, that is enough to recommend this movie. Bryan Cranston captures the complicated rebelliousness of the main character. In spite of his wealth, in the beginning of the film, Mr. Trumbo has a fierce social conscience and is willing to defend his right to freedom of speech and having unpopular ideas for himself and his fellpw writets. So much so that he is willing to go to jail for it.

The movie is excellent at exposing the shallow and malicious ""patriotism"" of people like Hedda Hopper, John Wayne, and Ronald Reagan. These people took joy in creating an atmosphere of fear, in the guise of ""protecting democracy"" to persecute those with whom they disagreed.

This movie does a good job of illustrating the hypocrisy, harm, and divisiveness caused by the blacklist and those who perpetuated it for over ten long years. And any movie with John Goodman in it can't be all bad. He plays a B-movie producer who, not out of a great social conscience but out of greed, gives Mr. Trumbo a break.

This is a sad, but entertaining look at a very ugly time in America.",1476576000,,1137,4.5911330049261085

Although I may tend to highlight my enthusiasm for the excellent film, it was thoroughly well written, performed and produced. I enjoyed every minute of this true-to-life presentation.

Another problem is that some of the actors (Bryan Cranston and Helen Mirren) don't seem to bring their characters to life. On the plus side, the photography and period settings are great and some of the secondary performances are memorable, namely John Goodman as a B-movie producer and Michael Stuhlbarg as Edward G. Robinson. If you are interested in the history of the blacklist era, you might find this interesting, but if not, skip it.",1475539200,,589,4.784313725490196

We have come come to expect excellence, and this film did not deliver that. He did a creditable job of portraying the man physically, but I did not get signals of inner turmoil.

7458555,4,B0167IE0KY,It was fascinating to see what the blacklisting and McCarthyism. The power of a few people having such a devastating effect on good peoples lives. How it was so easy to look away and not do the right thing.  Glad I watched this.,1474070400,,228,4.3023255813953485
7458556,4,B0167IE0KY,"Bryan Cranston was fantastic in his role as trumbo.  Diane Lane, Hellen Mirren were great as usual.  Excellent supporting cast.  Excellent movie; however my only problem with this movie is the fact that it portrays trumbo as the victim.  While I totally agree that he should have never served any time whatsoever for an opinion, considering the country we americans live in, Communism and russia/soviet union was a very unpleasant thing to agree with back then.  In fact anyone could make the argument it's still an unpleasant thing to talk about.  I feel trumbo and his friends who agreed with him should have kept their opinions to themselves and this movie wouldn't have even been a thing to think about.",1474070400,,707,4.85
7458557,3,B0167IE0KY,"Well.. I learned a thing or too about the black list era of movie making.  Nice period piece and costumes and set dressings.  And they showed the real Trumbo at the end.  Evidently John Wayne was a bully here to the liberals.. who actually went to that war #2... and Kirk Douglas was quite the hero in the 60s.  I still don't really care for Spartacus but you might.  And..  You can't help pull for Walter White as he spreads his cheeks for inspection before going off to prison.  That's just not right.. Trumbo seemed like a fair and smart guy.. to a fault.  Communism didn't help its cause much for being such a jerk back then either what with the Korea war and antagonistic Kremlin cronies and their rhetoric.  If you're brand of society is so awesome, why build a wall to keep people from leaving East Berlin?  Capitalism can learn a thing or too from Socialism too... so perhaps Trumbo might have been better off just calling himself a Liberal democrat that going full on communist.  To quote a script writing axiom, being a commie was too on the nose.. just be a liberal.  Meh.",1474070400,,1083,4.441624365482234

7458609,4,B0167IE0KY,"America always has to be terrified of someone or something.  In Fear We Trust.  Trumbo takes on the tragic blacklisting of Hollywood, which grew to a vertigo frenzy in the 1950s  -- and then just fizzled like a fad that got tired.  But not before ruining countless lives and careers and bankrupting families.  Whether it's Commies, hippies, AIDS, terrorists, Muslims, the federal government coming to take your guns  or whatever,  the hysteria feeds on itself  and makes pariahs of innocent people.  In Trumbo you see the nastiness and futility of this unique American pastime.  Excellent movie.",1473724800,,595,5.104166666666667

My husband and I both enjoyed this drama that takes you back to a time in the not too distant past when the USA feared the take-over by communistic principles.

The movie does a great job of drawing you in, getting you on the side of Trumbo and taking you on the journey with him, but in the Second Act of the film it feels like it drags a bit.
The dialogue is good. The plot is good. I just felt there was another layer or sense of deeper drama that they were missing. I wasn't stressed for the character at many points and he was under a fair amount of surveillance by the U.S. Government. That would drive anyone mad. I feel that it missed out on that point and a few others, not to discredit this film at all.
I feel that the reasons we came to watch this movie are there throughout and for the most reason they pay off; Those reasons being that it's a period piece, it's the Hollywood Blacklist story, and Bryan Cranston is the lead.",1473638400,,917,4.128491620111732

This film allows us to revisit a time in our country when the 1st Amendment of the Constitution was put on the back shelf.

The acting and the dialogue reeks of condescension. A very bad time in our history, with some real bad actors on the right, however there were real fears that do not make this a black and white issue. The evils of Stalinist Russia were real and the footprint of the conquest of Eastern Europe were evidence that safeguards had to be taken here.

Trumbo's own way of dealing with the crisis--writing hundreds of scripts for pseydonyms, was particularly arduous and troublesome for his family. His wife and daughters stick by him but show signs of the strain his hectic, non-stop schedule put on his family. The film is a gripping tale of how easily the patriots of the land of the free can become a lynch mob. The writing, directing and actors are all good. During the 50s America made progress at turning into a fascist state. ""Trumbo"" shows how nearly impossible it was for those caught in the vortext to survive intact.

Shortly after the 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union, Trumbo and his publishers decided to suspend reprinting the book until the end of the war. After receiving letters from right-wing isolationists requesting copies of the book, Trumbo contacted the FBI and turned these letters over to them.

There is a fair amount of explanation from all sides, but I do think there is more to the story then the movie represents. Still a well done, low key movie to enjoy!

If you are obsessed by Ben-Hur, Spartacus, Roman Holiday, Johnny Got His Gun and many other films Dalton Trumbo wrote, then this film may appeal to you. Bryan Cranston, Diane Lane, John Goodman, Helen Mirren, and Louis C.K. are great acting their roles. The problem with this film is that it's sometimes rather slow and sometimes painful to watch.

The result is an inspiring and uplifting passage from some of the darkest days of self-inflicted pain for our democracy, to the light and hope of a better day. This story of the tragic price paid by heroes and cowards alike when fear-mongers rule the day, is urgently needed viewing for much of our society - given the incredible amount of fear of ""un-American"" religion, politics and immigrants being peddled to the American voters, by one of our nominees for president this historical election year.  The acting was top-notch too!",1472342400,,709,4.859504132231405

However, the movie did not really explain why this fight was important - it was not about communism, it was about freedom to have different views and express different opinion.

K. turned a credible performance as one of the Hollywood 10. I could say more about Louis C.K.'s role, but do not want do spoilers.

This movie is for anyone who lived through that time, was born during the McCarthyism era (as was I) and whose parents recounted the horrors. (although my parents were Democrats in the Northern part of the US, they never joined or supported the Communist Party. But I heard about it.

This movie is also for older teens and young adults who care about First Amendment Rights.",1472342400,,859,4.751677852348993

It's heartbreaking and enraging to be reminded of the simmering presence of bigotry and fascism lurking just below the surface of American sociopolitical life.

7459146,5,B0167IE0KY,"Positive and uplifting.  This true story which was told in an entertaining and yet dramatic fashion, proves to me that we, the people, if we stick together and refuse to be motivated by fear mongering and selfishness, can overcome the new wave of fascism that has stealthily but ever increasingly been infiltrating through this 21st century in America.  Capitalism versus communism-doesn't matter.  All that matters is that the government of the United States was breaking the Supreme Law of the Land-The Constitution.  They were denying the right of its citizens to speak and assemble as they wish.  They used fear and propaganda to herd the masses in the direction of hysteria and incited division among Americans.  Exactly as they do now, whether it be about endless war, police brutality, white against black, immigrants, etc.  This movie was inspiring and showed that you should never allow yourself to believe everything you hear or read, especially from the media and the government, who work hand in hand to sway the masses in their favor in order to achieve the outcome they wish, which is NEVER in favor of the general public but only themselves to add more to their power and wealth.

7459258,4,B0167IE0KY,"Although this is a good movie from the standpoint of artistic and entertainment merit, anyone who thinks this is a ""history lesson"" is ignorant of the actual history.  We now know that the Communist Party in the US was funded and, to a large extent, directed by the KGB.  Trumbo himself bragged that communists in Hollywood had kept certain anti-communist movies from being made.  It is ironic that a film that endeavors to disprove the notion that Hollywood attempts to propagandize through film essentially ends up proving the point.  To describe communism as the political analog to a school child sharing her lunch with a less fortunate student is really beyond the pale.  Anyone remotely familiar with Soviet Communism knows that an actual communist would not share her lunch, but would rather establish a committee to confiscate the lunches of other students and divide them up based on loyalty to the committee.",1471737600,,918,5.0131578947368425

Woody Allen made a film called ""The Front"" several years ago that depicted the Hollywood blacklist very effectively. Like the worst of Hollywood today, Trumbo inappropriately simplifies and manipulates images of past history to do the ad hominem fear-mongering work of contemporary Democrats today.

And yes the film does evoke a certain empathy for Trumbo, who had the courage of his political convictions, however, he decided to align his political sensibilities with Lenin & Stalin's brand of communism; who remain champions of mass murder on a scale so large, that fortunately, their appetite for killing has known no equal.

The movie conveniently omits the discovery of communists who occupied high stations in the U. S. State Department, and gave sensitive information to Russia during the time Trumbo and cronies were harassed.  The Red Scare was NOT entirely imagined, too bad for Dalton Trumbo who was a harmless writer of high quality film plays which possess a timeless appeal, however he did carry the 'red' message and paid dearly for that.",1471564800,,1138,5.10752688172043

7459320,5,B0167IE0KY,"Well, all I can say is this was a great movie from the first frame to the last.  I actually lived through all of this and, as I was a child, I remember it to have been of short duration. I had no idea that these people were blacklisted well up into the late 50s.  This movie shows what the human spirit can overcome and what it cannot.  The tragedies abound in this scenario, lives lost, careers lost, families lost, property gone.  And yet there were those individual who were able to find another way to keep going, as did Trumbo and several of his fellow writers.
What I particularly loved was the producer and the Hollywood star who knew that Trumbo could turn out a great film and were willing to put his name on the scripts on which they were working.  That took great courage.
In a way, it is a sad commentary on the mob mentality and it carries a good message for the political climate today.  We often take our freedoms for granted and to watch the devastation caused when these freedoms are abused as they were in this movie, is a wake up call.  A great movie, not just a good movie.",1471564800,,1093,4.251207729468599

America is and has always been a country of strife and striving, where division and upheaval form the bedrock of progress. Disagreement with others is fine - it forms the basis for our body politic, but when people are censured for their ideas we begin to hurtle down the dark path of self-destruction.
This movie illustrates beautifully how the best intentions of those who feel passionately for their cause can become twisted into evil self-righteousness, a lesson all to appropriate for the turmoil of our modern age.",1471219200,,690,4.8559322033898304

7459405,1,B0167IE0KY,"The movie could be great or not. I will never know as a Amazon Prime member/ renter. After 2 hours of searching, re-searching and trying not to be a dinosaur I just quit trying. I have a severe hearing problem which is aided consider ably while watching tv by utilizing the cc systems available on all major DVDs. Three separate people,-all under the age of 55, were unable to make any one of the systems respond to a closed captioning command. So net result is I rented a top tier movie, with little or no hassle, just to find I couldn't watch (hear) it. This is the third time I have encountered this but til now I just took my lumps and crawled off defeated. I am writing this to appease my outraged 18 year old neighbor who feels you have ripped a 73 year old handicapped PRIME user! She insists that a set of directions is missing and that I deserve to be able to view movies of my choice without further frustration or expense. Hearing aids are not mandated by Medicare and decent ones cost well into the thousands of dollars. Headphones preclude 2 or more watching at same time  As for Me? I love Bryan Cranston-- joining Prime allowed me to actually save money w/o  engaging in a struggle. But Lo, Here cometh the ""struggle"" ....And I can't even hear the rumblings!

7459408,5,B0167IE0KY,"I liked it a lot.  Yeah, you can criticize all you want but the scripted story is good, the acting is great, and the sets and film excellent.  I also enjoyed the music.  Of course, there is much more to the entire story of blacklisting and the politics of the time!  Not much time focusing on Joe McCarthy and J. Edgar Hoover.  But, Helen Mirren was superb as the evil Hedda Hopper, which made up for some of the missing politics.  A brief glimpse of many actors and writers of the time, overblown political witch hunts which show that the First Amendment was, and still is in jeopardy.  The issues about the supreme court then is very timely, given that there is currently a very similar issue 65 years later.
If you  are someone who thinks there is a ""..war on Xmas"", and thinks ""..better dead than red"" means more than ""robber barons"", you should probably go bury your head in a mindless Pixar movie.

7459449,4,B0167IE0KY,"Stunning acting in a moderate script that follows a prototypical hero story railing against the machine of Hollywood insiders and corrupt, fear mongering government insiders. If it weren't so apropos to today, sadly, this likely would have run hollow. But Trumbo's adaptability as a screenwriter, and his brilliance show the resilience of the artist and human, which this screenplay could have used a little more of - especially with regards to the portrayal of the women. But it was the 1950s, after all. There is a moderate attempt to do so with the subplot involving the daughter and family relations, but it's mostly an afterthought. (If the film had been from the daughter's point of view, now THAT would have been interesting.) If you know Trumbo's work and life history, this film won't teach you anything you don't already likely know. But if you didn't know that one of the greatest screenwriters was almost completely prevented from exercising his craft in a country that supposedly champions free speech and the right to express yourself, then it's worth a watch. Cranston is proving himself a masterful historical curmudgeon-reenactor - although his LBJ far outshines this portrayal. Trumbo in real life was a much more charactery creature, and Cranston has a sort of aged Goulet-esque meets kindly professor bravado and carriage, rather than the real man who was famously more eccentric. Lane is lovely as always, but is woefully underserved (see above). Would love to see her carry a movie with some actual heft. Mirren is an odd choice for this role - though she executes her part efficiently, there's not more than one note or two in what could have been a symphony. Michael Stahlberg gives the most nuanced performance with an unexpectedly sympathetic take on the oft caricatured Edward G Robinson. Elle Fanning is making the beginnings of some fine dramatic acting choices in this film (if only the script gave her a little more). Louis CK and Alan Tudyk give solid supporting performances, though I wish both didn't feel like sidekicks, ditto the rest of the Hollywood 10. The music, design and camera work are all lovely, but lack the spectacular flash and technicolor of the era, which could have been an interesting conceptual contrast the the darkness and persecution of its subject. All in all, a worthwhile film, and great acting choices keep this from being a snoozer, if you're a history or hollywood buff, into politics, or both.",1470873600,,2457,4.980535279805353

Revulsion at the abuse of workers during the Great Depression caused many thoughtful men and women to align themselves, to varying degrees, with socialism that is, even today, reflected in the political system.
The film itself was excellently created, produced and acted (other reviewers have adequately explained the story arc) and except for minor digressions from other reported history it cleaved closely to Dalton Trumbo's career and life experience. There is no doubt that he was a skilled and dedicated story teller of great sensitivity and insight. The tragedy, at least to this reviewer, lies in his being deprived of the great work opportunities that should have been his, from which multitudes of filmgoers would have benefited. Recall Napoleon: ""Ability is of no account without opportunity."" Trumbo's opportunities were stolen from him by lesser men.",1470787200,,1116,5.419540229885057

7459585,5,B0167IE0KY,"WoW! Bryan Cranston has shown his brilliance twice the past year with LBJ and the dramatic historical impact on a sad part of America's history of unwarranted fear mongering Black List and McCarthyism.  These two movies should be mandatory viewing in Civics classes in HS and the Political Science in College where you learn how you were lied to in HS.  It's easy to see why Hollywood leans strongly to civil rights after such events. Being born in 1950 and witnessed much of this Commie Fear that NEVER materialized and a Vietnam Vet no such red wave of domino's ever arrived on our shores unless one considers the Made in Vietnam products we buy today in retail chains.

The same Fear mongering continues today with a Facist mirroring the Hitler formula in Trump Style. Anyone think history can't be repeated? Just watch the news feeds today and study Hitler's rise/methodology. Very Scary! Were we to put Trump in office we'd be fighting costly bankrupting wars globally and the American soldier is not to be wasted as Cannon fodder for a Presidents EGO.  Younger folks would never understand that Vietnam was actually funded and paid for with the passage of numerous excise taxes - these recent conflicts have never been funded or taxed and they add to the very debt the Republicans scream about but never pay for.",1470787200,,1318,4.79295154185022

The film is pretty spot on. Not sure about Niki Trumbo's civil rights scenes. Maybe artistic license? Would have to go back and check the book.

If you work in the industry, this is a must watch. If you are a filmmaker, you should read the bio, too, which is hard to get.

The Hollywood Blacklist was a self-inflicted black eye (pun intended) on the film industry. An indictment of lives which, in America, should have never happened.

Great line in Bryan Cranston's Trumbo about the silly gold statute having blood on it. Wow.

Saw some Hollywood South faces, too.

This film focuses too narrowly on Dalton Trumbo, blurring the context of the Cold War period. Blacklisting extended throughout the industry, from actors and writers down to set builders and paperhangers. Trumbo is portrayed in the film as being overdriven, neurotic, drinking and pill taking. All this gives the impression that Trumbo's behavior stems from something abnormal about him, rather than being the result of something abnormal about those times in America.

7459789,5,B0167IE0KY,"This is a well-done film that reminded me of the time in my childhood when people were afraid that they would have a finger pointed at them for having different beliefs - even though we live in a country that supposedly allows freedom to believe.  Bryan Cranston portrays Dalton Trumbo brilliantly.  The film has high production values. For example: the actors portraying well-known movie stars and gossip columnists such as Edward G. Robinson, Kirk Douglas, Hedda Hopper and John Wayne were given the opportunity to do really good portrayals.  And they were supported by costume designers, make-up artists and vocal coaches.  My guess is that the portrayals of movie studio executives were well done also.

Trumbo feels like a labor of love that covers a difficult subject in our history.  People in Hollywood lost their jobs if they admitted to being a member of the Communist Party - or if they were believed to be members of the Communist Party.  Being a member of the Communist Party was not (and is still not) illegal.  Trumbo went to jail because he refused to give up names of others; he was in contempt of senate hearings on un-American activities.  The Hollywood blacklist was a shameful outgrowth of fear.  This film takes a personal look at the time through the experiences of Dalton Trumbo and his family.",1470614400,,1318,4.84375
7459790,5,B0167IE0KY,"Excellent, entertaining film about an extremely important subject.  Not surprisingly, outstanding acting by Bryan Cranston.
Would have liked more special features on the DVD.  There are a couple of short features that are really little more than extended trailers.  Seems to be an increasing trend in the industry, to have few, if any, extras on the disc.  It's especially too bad in this case, as we would have loved watching more sequences with the real Trumbo, and perhaps more interviews with his daughter.  But the film itself was great.  The intermingling of original footage with current sequences was particularly well-done.  And watching the short clip of Joseph McCarthy spewing his venom was eerily reminiscent...in both content and delivery... of the abhorrent, inane nonsense that comes out of the mouth of one of our current presidential candidates.  And if you can't figure out to which one I'm referring perhaps this movie isn't for you.",1470528000,,953,5.183006535947713

7459793,5,B0167IE0KY,"A brilliant, educational and well written movie. The dialogue is well done, the acting excellent. I learned a great deal about the McCarthy encounters with Hollywood screen writers and Trumbo, in particular. Very entertaining and education piece. So very well done",1470441600,,264,5.463414634146342
7459794,3,B0167IE0KY,"It comes as something of a coincidence that the day before I caught up with Jay Roachs biopic I should have watched ROMAN HOLIDAY, one of the twp films for which Dalton Trumbo won an Oscar but was unable to collect it owing to his being blacklisted as a member of the so- called ""Hollywood Ten.""

The film takes a chronological approach to the material by focusing on Trumbo's success as a writer before the crisis blew up in 1947. Happily married with three children, he had just signed a lucrative contract with MGM and been congratulated by its boss, Louis B. Mayer (Richard Portnow).

Then the controversy blew up, due in no small part to the machinations of gossip columnist Hedda Hopper (Helen Mirren), who not only publicized Trumbo's leftist connections but intimidated all the studio bosses into rendering him a pariah by threatening to expose their true backgrounds. Despite its protestations of support for the Hollywood Ten, most Hollywood luminaries caved in to the relentless pressure exerted by the anti-communist investigators led by the sanctimonious J. Parnell Thomas (James DuMont). Even Edward G. Robinson (Michael Stuhlbarg), one of Trumbo's most loyal allies, caved in once he realized that there was no prospect of future work unless he did so.

Thematically speaking Roach does a good job of evoking the atmosphere of paranoia and intimidation characteristic of that time, when no one, it seemed, was willing to stand up for themselves except Trumbo and his nine fellow-accused writers, all of whom went to prison for refusing to declare their communist sympathies. Ably portrayed by Bryan Cranston, Trumbo comes across as single-minded in his desire not only to resist the interrogators but to continue working, even if it means adopting a variety of pseudonyms.

On the other hand much of the action takes place in a cinematic never-never land of perpetual sunshine and uniformly bright interior lighting. This is especially evident in the domestic sequences, where Trumbo's obsession renders him oblivious to his wife (Diane Lane) and children. Matters get worse until the climactic sequence where the screenwriter realized that his eldest daughter Niki (Elle Fanning) is actually much like himself in terms of character. This character change introduces a note of syrupy optimism into a very unsyrupy story - and perhaps explains the use of lighting.

Thereafter the plot falls away and becomes a rather pedestrian chronology of Trumbo's life in the Sixties and Seventies, where he was devoted to his family and separated himself from the zeitgeist. This does not seem plausible for someone who fought so hard to clear his name over many years of toil and hardship.

The basic plot of the film has uncomfortable resonances for today, especially in the run-up to the forthcoming US election where it seems that the kind of polarizing strategies characteristic of the early Fifties have been rekindled. One only wishes that Roach had followed the plot through a little less sentimentally.",1470441600,,3014,5.115853658536586

It was a true story about the screen writers, specifically, and others that were blacklisted for being communists. I found the historical aspect of that time interesting and informative. It was frustrating to know our government came down hard on people that were registered in the communist party. It was a party that you could register under just like democrat or republican. Because of the Soviet Union, people found it was scary or offensive. We tend to see defamation of different aspects of our society rampant at any time of our societal history.

7459959,4,B0167IE0KY,This movie was a good glimpse into a time when our congress was obsessed by communists.  It's a true story about a screenwriter who was a communist and was blacklisted because of his political beliefs.

Cranston is perfect in the title role, and he is supported by an excellent cast.

7460037,5,B0167IE0KY,"Trumbo covers one of the most ironic series of events in American history. The focus on Mr. Trumbo requires the viewer to bring a knowledge of the larger picture and players who do not figure in the plot, or who appear in cameo roles. The House Un-American Affairs Committee claimed to be saving the American way of life from Communist subversion, infiltration and domination. The irony is that the people who created the black list used tyranny, intimidation, coercion, imprisonment and internal exile to defend freedom, initiative, competition and incentive. They created a monopolistic, single-source, approval process for hiring screen writers. Just like every monopolistic, centrally controlled vehicle of commerce that has ever existed, their system failed to provide a product that people wanted. They failed totally.

The second irony is that to keep Hollywood alive and making money, the studio owners behind the black list had to ignore the evidence that all of the good scripts were written by Dalton Trumbo and other blacklisted screen writers. It was the black market that broke the blacklist. It was supply and demand that liberated Hollywood.

Trumbo is a ringside seat to the trauma and suffering that was inflicted on so many individuals. Watch it and remember that repression of all kinds is never what people want. They want freedom and the ability to fulfill their dreams.",1469491200,,1392,5.182222222222222

The Russian Revolution had occurred in 1917. The idea of equality for all during the Depression was progressive. But right wing Senators, led by the repulsive Joseph McCarthy, with young Richard M. Nixon at his side, initiated a witch hunt to destroy Party members. And they went after the Hollywood Commies. Trumbo fought back.

in this film took place, I remember a great deal about the whole affair. Bryan Cranston does his usual
remarkable embodiment of the character and he is supported superbly by the rest of the cast, in particular
Louis CK who turned in a very strong performance. Helen Mirren of course, did not disappoint with just the
perfect amount of bitchiness in the role of Hedda Hopper. I did not know how deeply involved Hedda Hopper
was in the witch hunt so that was quite a revelation! Diane Lane and the young actors who played the Trumbo
children were also just terrific.",1469491200,,662,4.479338842975206

I strongly recommend this movie as a history lesson for all of us.,1468886400,,309,4.43859649122807
7460456,5,B0167IE0KY,"Outstanding casting and an extremely interesting, entertaining, and, at times, inspirational story.  I'm sure there were many ""liberties"" taken in the narrative which made it to the screen but, as I watch movies for the acting and escapism they provide, the truth (always an arguable topic) rarely stands in the way of my enjoying a well-made film.  The acting in this film is fantastic and the story is beautifully told.  Well worth the roughly two hours it takes to watch it.  Highly recommended!",1468886400,,498,4.963855421686747

Too many commenters here are rather ignorant of what was known in the West of Soviet communism during the 1930s and 1940s. Until Kruschev confirmed publicly of Stalin's repressive system in 1956, rumours of concentration camps and purges were known only through anectdotal bits and pieces. In the late 1950s and 1960s many personal histories were published, i.e. Journey Into the Whirlwind, etc, and it wasn't until 1973 that The Gulag Archipelago was published in West. Looking from 2016, it's easy to see what a tyrant Stalin was, but in the 1930s and early 1940s most of the stories in the US press were positive in regards to life in the USSR.",1468800000,,723,4.878048780487805

7460577,2,B0167IE0KY,"The movie was great with one MAJOR problem. Portraying Hedda Hopper as an evil queen of Hollywood blacklist supporters while give the others (all men) a mostly pass was unacceptable. I've read the book and that is neither how the author portrayed her nor does it reflect reality. To have the only major woman character so vilified is atrocious, given that the ones with the real control (men owning studios, men in congress) were everywhere. I can see the writer thinking ""great plot device"" but it was both implicitly and explicitly misogynistic and ruined an otherwise well acted, well written movie.

It is a warning as well, that the only safeguard against any such perversion, is constant vigilance. ""Trumbo"" is a uniformly brilliant film in which we learn the names of a few of the real-life persecutors, and also of those like Kirk Douglas and Otto Preminger, who were the champions of  free expression in U.S. Cinema.",1468800000,,685,4.956521739130435
7460582,3,B0167IE0KY,"Bryan Cranston gave a full portrayal of Dalton Trumbo during a period when American values had gone amok, but overall, something was missing in the movie.  Perhaps it was the lack of a formidable villain. Helen Mirren grabbed attention as Hedda Hopper but in her role, she did not appear to be the one spearheading the drive to purge Hollywood of insidious communist infiltrators.  It almost seemed as though ""complacency"" in acceptance of the danger these men presented was the opponent.

It was interesting to learn that many of the writers continued to author scripts while blacklisted.  Despite this, they certainly suffered with the assault to their principles, prison time, loss of income, loss of reputation and isolation.  But without rising to any culminating crisis, the movie fizzled to an end just as the blacklist collapsed when directors, desperate to have worthy material to film began giving credit to those who deserved it.",1468800000,,940,5.117647058823529

7460631,3,B0167IE0KY,"Cranston is always entertaining, and he does not disappoint. However, the movie whitewashes the history of the CPUSA, which actually did take orders from Moscow, did infiltrate the State Department and Hollywood, and was part of a global effort of communist revolution. Further, the movie cleverly weaves in two Republicans into the anti-communist movement to suggest it was a Republican witch-hunt. In fact the House Committee was almost always run by Democrats until it was disbanded during the Carter administration. Further, the movie suggests somewhat that JFK was weak on communism, when in fact he was a strong anti-communist - and that is probably what got him shot.

Entertaining, but as with everything Hollywood, don't consider it a history lesson.",1468800000,,759,5.325

Brian Cranston is good but he didn't make me forget he was Brian Cranston. And I was unsure what they were attempting, the film makers or casting, as to the 'character' actors they used. Were they trying to do impressions of their characters? Kirk Douglas was a good choice. The only thing about Edward G. that reminded me of Edward G. was his hair. John Wayne? Otto Preminger wasn't bad. I know that when you try to duplicate or impersonate historical figures it can lead to some problems and cross some lines. At what point does it become comedy.

His depiction of the Black Listed Trumbo in Hollywood is one if high ideals, uncompromising morality, adjustment to change of circumstances and also the human toll his high stance took on his family, who were pariahed from society . Louis C. K. gives a great performance of his stalwart friend who doesn't know if he can have the courage of his convictions, literally, and his family too. Jail Time, reintegrating into society, and ghostwriting Academy Award winning materials and films without the acknowledgement was considered cold revenge: money making with work for all . The Press and SAG were the most vehement naysayers against the Communist Threat. It is a good arc for our politics today when all of one philosophy are considered bad/undue influence.

7460780,4,B0167IE0KY,"TRUMBO GETS 4 STARS...Bryan Cranston takes you into a post-depression era in HOllywood and gives you a star-quality performance.  It is truly a great film...done to expose, educate, and enlighten (without other distractions like too much sex).  The business is serious.
SOME PEOPLE THINK communism is better than ""American"" capitalism.  Now.  Let me give my view & opinion because this argument (quagmire too) is still on the table in America today.  I like capitalism and I love America, but OUR particular brand of capitalism needs to be tweeked and there is a movement that is rather ""quietly"" going on and it seems to be bent around the same question that TRUMBO asked his daughter: (paraphrased)  ""What if you had a lot while others had none?""  Today's question is: ""WHAT SHOULD AMERICA DO ABOUT ITS ''FILTHY RICH'' PEOPLE: ''INSANELY WEALTHY'', ''VULGARLY WEALTHY'' WHILE OTHER PEOPLE 'STARVE' ON LOW-INCOME OR NO INCOME...AND ON THE PUBLIC DOLE?"" This question is older and bigger than you think.  And Trumbo demonstrates some of the answer in this movie with: how a ""real man"" carves his way to the top (while his family seems unappreciative, which, appears to be an 'error' to me, especially with the disrespectful teen daughter: that's more-like 60s, 70s culture, not the 40s.  Children didn't speak to their parents in that way; this is why the 60s came in.  Children wanted to tell their (seemingly rich) parents how they felt about their parenting and a lot of other complaints they had.  During the 40s following the Great Depression in '29 and the war in '45...the mantra was: ""You better be glad you got parents!"")  So.  I dropped ''a star'' for that error.

IN THIS MOVIE TRUMBO gave his daughter a litinus test with one question to see if she had a communistic mind  and spirit in her soul.  (paraphrased):  ""If you had a sandwich to eat and a kid at school had nothing what would you do?""  That's an even bigger question but then in many ways it is the same question about the ""stunningly wealthy"" and the poor people.  Well... what's the answer?  (It's a kid, afterall, not an adult who has nothing to eat and we've got that problem today even though our crust of rich people have gained billions at our top.)  Well, according to TRUMBO his daughter gave the ''communistic'' answer.
  I'll just say as a capitalistic American: WE NEED OUR CRUST OF RICH PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY. APPARENTLY, WE NEED OUR CRUST OF POOR AS WELL...since every society has a crust of poor people anyway.)  THE ""TRUE MAN"" CARVES HIS WAY: check-out TRUMBO as he carves...WE MUST CELEBRATE THAT.  THAT'S WHERE our ''QUALITY'' COMES FROM AND WE MUST APPRECIATE THAT.  IT IS NOT AUTOMATIC.  IT HAS TO BE ""STIRRED"" BY EVENTS.  IT ALWAYS SHOWS UP AS A RESULT OF STRUGGLE.  AND, AS OUR REAL MEN STRUGGLE THEY CREATE ABUNDANCE ENOUGH FOR ALL: the rich man creates jobs and the workers do those jobs and our country struggles and struggles to give birth to our ''middleclass'' and they feed the people charitably who have no food and means of income.  But they give them just enough to leave that vibrant sense of struggle.  That's how life seems to be and how it works BEST in a human society.  The formula in America must be SACRED.  If any ''middleclass people'' are caught in the web of the ''poor'' they will rise eventually; they will go into a passionate struggle to ""produce"" and ""create""  and ""carve their way'' like TRUMBO and they ''carve'' their way out of being destitute.  It works better when the middleclass is relieved by a ''helping hand'' during a pre-longed struggle or by ending an Era of Scorn, persecution, and, imprisonment when it is realized to be the Wrong Way Around for America!",1468627200,,3692,4.742543171114599

I can't say that Dalton Trumbo was a familiar name in my lexicon, but I certainly have enjoyed many of the movies he wrote.  What an incredible talent.  The entire McCarthy era is one that's very interesting, and I hope there are always brave souls to take on tyranny of any sort.

Good portrayals and a screenplay Trumbo himself would have been proud of.  Well acted.  Too bad its Oscar Yield was so low.  Bryan Cranston was nominated, but did not take home the Oscar.  Supporting cast could have been better, perhaps, but Helen Mirren was well cast and brought a 'touch of evil' to the role.

This was an entertaining, very well done movie, in our opinions.  It did start a little slow, but it didn't take long to pick up and ended up being a fascinating perspective of movie writers in 1950s Hollywood and for that matter how we treated fellow Americans when they didn't really adhere to the 'status quo'.  It amazed us of how many similarities there are with what we consider to be the abhorrent behavior of our government, and in particular congress, then as compared to similar situations today.  We really don't know how accurate historically this movie is, and frankly, we didn't really care.  We do, however, know that we really enjoyed it.",1468540800,,918,4.71875

7461124,1,B0167IE0KY,"It's interesting how the actors and writers that were accused of and who were in reality, self admitted members of the communist party cried loudly against suppression of their free speech and felt persecuted because they were barred from seeking employment in their industry..An industry where they could wield such a medium as film...and influence the masses and promote communist principles.....it's really humorous that they are now the people currently in power in the Hollywood of today and are NOW doing the very same things that they saw as being so fascist ..which is basically preventing those actors and writers that dissent and disagree, (like republican actors for instance), and now have to hide, because they will not get any work and be essentially black balled in Hollywood if they dare to voice a different view from those of the hard left/communist. Pretty funny that when your side is losing, you cry, ""I just want freedom of speech and freedom to pursue my happiness"", but when you are winning, all of a sudden...stifling any other voice that differs from your own becomes just A-okay. The height of hypocrisy I suppose. Anyway, the acting is good but is highly sympathetic in tone to who else??? You guessed it...The poor communists. Just remember....these guys all run Hollyweird and are influencing all of us just as they always wanted, while stifling and preventing anyone who dares to take a different view from making a living.",1468540800,13,1454,5.012396694214876

Helen Mirren was quite good as Hedda Hopper. Michael Sthulbarg elicited sympathy from this viewer as Edward G. Robinson. His story was a reminder that it is easy (often too easy) to condemn those whom we disagree or who seem to act in a cowardly manner without fully understanding the reasons for their views or behavior. We may, in the end, condemn them anyway, but it is important to realize they often have have no good options available and their decisions may have been very difficult, even agonizing, for them as well. It was an important, though shameful, period in our history.

Even though I'm in my late 60s, I'm still too young to have had any memory of this, and my parents never talked about it.  Most of us are well aware of the Joe McCarthy era and the House Un-American Activities Commission, but only really know that McCarthy was eventually discredited and driven out of government.  The story of at least some of the affected people comes to life here, and it is well worth the time.  Bryan Cranston shines, as usual, and has some great help from Helen Mirren, playing against type this time.  It's fun to see well-known names in the business, like John Wayne, L.B. Mayer, and Otto Preminger portrayed as real people for a change.  Too bad hardly anyone saw this in theaters, but it's absolutely worth watching.",1468454400,,846,4.760273972602739

7461398,2,B0167IE0KY,"The ""Trumbo"" actors and plot are very well done and the characters very sympathetic, but the apologetics are thin.  Every Communist I have met was idealistic, kind, warm hearted and well intentioned.  That is what gives communism such appeal to liberals, academics and the young who just follow along.  Those principles even justified the transfer of out atomic secrets to Joe Stalin. But looking at the history of communism you find a very consistent pattern.  Joe Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Castro and Chavez are some of the better known.  It appears that idealism is very fertile ground for building vicious, repressive, murderous dictatorships.  But none of them tolerated the existence of liberal idealists in their ranks. In fact liberal idealists were, like Trotsky, the first to disappear. Of course academics always pretend that next time they will get it right. Only fools believe that.",1468195200,4,891,5.152777777777778

7461431,5,B0167IE0KY,"""Trumbo"" tells the story of blacklisted Hollywood screenwriter Dalton Trumbo without holding back on criticism of those who led the charge against American artists and writers whose leftist views led them to be identified as members of the Communist Party of the US or to be tarred with epithets against them as ""fellow travelers"" or ""dupes"" of the Cold War's ""Communist conspiracy."" As a 17-year old high school graduate in Indianapolis, I was completely taken by the right-wing campaign against the ""un-American"" people whose political views led to their persecution by other Americans, like the celebrated but hideous Hedda Hopper, under the ruse that their views somehow were inspired by or supported by or directly linked to the Soviet Union and ""Red"" China, our ""enemies"" through the destructive, hugely expensive, nuclear-destruction-developing Cold War. It took a little time once exposed to the facts to throw off the views of the Birch Society/Young Americans for Freedom in favor of a more rational and crtitical view of contemporary political thought. When an arch-conservative Senator's son told me one day that I was being much too much influenced by my ""communistic professors,"" I realized I had arrived among the critical thinking people at the university. I saw the vicious hatred of fellow Americans based on their political beliefs turned into accusations of aiding and abetting enemies said to be worse than the Axis powers of World War II. The American way of smearing people based on their stated beliefs, in complete disregard of freedom of speech, press, and assembly, was as clear to me as it was to Trumbo. The difference was that Trumbo was older, smarter, and willing to fight back for the sake of freedom. This film conveys the spirit of Trumbo, well portrayed by Bryan Cranston, and the other blacklisted people, showing them as the victims of the right-wing conspirators who sought to destroy them economically and socially. They fought back and this film shows their heroic struggle ending in a victory that should leave thinking viewers cheering.",1467936000,,2079,5.153846153846154

7461485,5,B0167IE0KY,"Great movie.  Wonderful casting, good acting, intelligent writing, and well-paced execution.  The story reveals a part of our history that we need to remember lest it happen again.  Trumbo was a real hero--at least this portrayal of him shows it that way--though I'm sure it was at least as hard on his family as the film indicates.  I really liked the scenes/story lines with particular actors (good casting found some look-alikes for iconic stars) that showed how they interacted with Trumbo despite the blacklist.  And the ""sweet revenge"" when he decided (did his daughter really convince him?) to claim the Oscar(s) he had earned, and to take back his name.

I assume the film honored history as much as possible; I really appreciate the real-life photos during the credits, and especially the historic recording of Trumbo's ""if I were to receive the Oscar"" speech.

If you like this film you might also enjoy ""Cradle Will Rock"" (1999)--about politics and art in NYC in the 1930s.  Similar themes, similar iconic historic figures run through both films.",1467849600,,1057,5.0

As he battled hatred and bigotry, Trumbo was gentle as a dove, cunning as a serpent.  The subject is serious, but there is humor throughout. The fun part of the movie is seeing Hollywood's legendary directors, actors, and writers being themselves.

Historically, there is, of course, some argument about the effects of that famous bogus bulls*** unamerican witch hunt.
I'm so glad it didn't center on the perpetrators of that assault on American rights. We all know who, and why, and if you don't despise them,
you probably won't like this. I wish you'd watch it though.
the performances are first rate entire. The story flows, with never too much of Trumbos humor, but great reference to them.. as should be.
He was a smart man and a great writer.
There is much sadness, humor, moments truly touching and within the humanity a warning clear and present--coming from the people.
I really recommend this. Good direction, good approach to the subject matter and the people.

It was not the stereotype 60s commie. As far as John Wayne I enjoy his films and his acting, I known people that have met him and said nice things about him.

And it's in full swing today; sounding like Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in the 1930's and a fearful U.S. in the 1950's. It would behoove those followers of demagoguery who have little historical knowledge and insight to learn how easily people can be lead into fear and intolerance.

7461728,5,B0167IE0KY,"In 1947, Dalton Trumbo (Bryan Cranston) was Hollywood's top screenwriter until he and other artists were jailed and blacklisted for their political beliefs. He exposed the absurdity and injustice of the blacklist, which entangled everyone from gossip columnist Hedda Hopper (Helen Mirren) to John Wayne, Kirk Douglas and Otto Preminger. many in Hollywood at this time believed that there needed to be changes in Washington (sound familiar?) so they joined the American Communist party, different from the Communists, they just wanted a change but at that time the word was enough to convict. Hedda Hopper and many other big Hollywood names caused these free thinkers to be black listed and jailed. This is a fascinating story and one that should be told and seen as something more than just a movie. The performances? WOW. each and every one...sensational. Kudos to Bryan Cranston, Diane Lane, John Goodman and the whole cast.",1467417600,,926,5.18

7461735,3,B0167IE0KY,Nice rehashing of known Hollywood hour of shame.  Cranston (once again) is overrated. It seems the only way I can tell that's he's playing a different role is by the state (or not) of his mustache and hair-do or lack thereof.  It was a TV docudrama that made it to the big screen.  Mirren should have gotten top billing and more focus could have been made on Hedda's involvement with the blacklisting... now THAT would really be interesting. Was Diane blackmailed into making this pic?  She couldn't have been blander.,1467331200,,518,4.722222222222222

7461858,4,B0167IE0KY,"Another outstanding performance by Bryan Cranston, portraying a most unusual character in Dalton Trumbo. Outside of that, it comes off a bit contrived. You can easily predict the events and not just because it's all in the history books. I thought Hellen Mirren's part was somewhat of a waste of her considerable talents. John Goodman was however extraordinary in his usual large and profane way. I like Diane Lane a lot, but she pretty much phones it in here. Not sexy like her better roles.

This film is particularly relevant now, when a large number of our citizenry are ready to condemn any group of people who are accused of being criminally dangerous...or just ""different"".

I sat in the theatre during a first run I was Martin Ray's age, I cried. I was the boy on the screen. Later I would read The story of Ferdinand, which must have swum in Trumbo's mind. Trumbo's actor delivered a pristine performance, with a rounded out character, no punches pulled. The resemblance with the Kirk Douglass actor was canny and strengthened the ambiance.

Although I knew that a lot of actors and Hollywood people were affected by McCarthy's witch hunt, I had never heard of Trumbo before and what he went through. What an incredibly talented and principled man. If anything he embodied true American values much more so than those who went after him. And I love the ingenious way he kept on working. But, ironically, he was also lucky to be a writer and not an actor. Because the actors, once blacklisted, really could not work secretly like Trumbo did.

So other than the populist hype about the McCarthy investigation, I didn't know much about Communism in the USA. This film really is an eye-opener and presents aspects of Communism that most of us have never given any thought to. As to the performances, Bryan Cranston provides a spot-on portrayal of Dalton Trumbo--the file footage during the end credits give credence to the strength of his performance.

McCarthy himself was a drunk and sardonic lack luster individual who eventually ruined many lives and caused much harm to many US citizens without due cause or any real purpose. The story is about how Dalton Trumbo, a great writer that no one can doubt, overcame these dire circumstances by stealth and cleaver maneuvering. Along the way he helped many friends and certainly helped the movie industry which is always in need of good story writers. It is a story of courage and tenacity to not let evil circumstances get the better of ones life and abilities. A movie which many Americans will appreciate during the mud-slinging of the current political campaigning.

7461975,3,B0167IE0KY,"2 stars means ""I didn't like it"" and 3 stars means ""it's okay.""  3 stars it is.  It an okay movie.  Nothing exciting here.  No drama, no suspense, no gratuitous sex (which ordinarily I don't care for, but I expected some with Helen Mirren . . . ), really nothing here at all.  The film purports to tell the story of the Hollywood Blacklist as experienced by Dalton Trumbo.  But this presents a problem for movie making; other than his brief stretch in prison for Contempt of Congress (which the movie more or less glosses over), Trumbo didn't experience any real hardship that an ordinary person can relate to.  Yes, he was blackballed from the major studios for awhile, yes he had to sell his massive ranch.  But the first ""hardship"" job he took writing B movies paid him $1,500 for about 3 days work.  That's about 6 months of wages for a regular person in the early 1950's.  He owned a house and a car and was able to provide for his family.  They had a pool for God sakes!  Where's the horror?  Where's the struggle? There's really not a whole lot of real conflict, loss or redemption.  An arrogant Hollywood writer had to write under a pseudonym for a few years and made a pretty good middle class living doing it.

Which begs the question:  why was there so little drama and suspense in this film?

Possibly, I think, because of the preconceptions we bring to the film.  For 70 years we have been inundated with references to the horrible ""dark days"" of the Dies Committee, HUAC, the Hollywood 10, McCarthyism, and the ""Red Scare"" generally of the 1940's and 50's.  People were put on the hot seat, names were named, lives destroyed, and the Constitution nearly shredded by the communist hysteria.  That's the story, anyway.

If you come into this film with the popular media conception of the blacklist I think you're going to be a little let down.  You're expecting poor, put-upon artists and their families cast into the depths of poverty and despair for their political beliefs.  You won't find that here.

Which brings me to something else I've noticed about films involving this subject matter.  Never, never, does the film get into any kind of detail about what the specific accusations are, how they came to HUAC's attention, and what kind of evidence there is.  The ""witch hunt"" is assumed. I suspect that's because the actual accusations and evidence are such that, if depicted on screen, people would not sympathize with the preferred ""victim.""

This is getting too long but of you want to read a short bit about Dalton Trumbo that you won't find in this film check out ""Fountain of Lies', by Art Eckstein at Frontpagemag dot com.

7462072,3,B0167IE0KY,"First, it's certainly not horrible. It does seem inconsistent, since it's a period film you expect an authentic experience. So the manner in which the characters speak is very much like the old movies such as Roman Holiday but the words they speak are too modern. Did people say ""that's not happening"" during the McCarthy era? Brian Cranston gave the best performance in the film, Diane Lane is OK but kind of robotic and Helen Mirren cast as Hedda Hopper  seems a good choice but it's a small part and nothing spectacular about her role here. The story itself of Trumbo the writer didn't add anything to the Hollywood Commie narrative as far as I can see. There are some very good scenes with Cranston and Michael Stulhbarg who portrays Edward G. Robinson. John Goodman has a small part and he was very funny in scenes with Cranston.",1466985600,,834,4.635135135135135

7462107,3,B0167IE0KY,"From a film making perspective it was entertaining and well produced. Bryan Cranston and the cast did a fine job.
The problem was the political propagandizing making heroes out of the communists.
Communism is sanitized for mass consumption, basically reducing it to a fight for decent wages for the front line production workers. Yeah, who could be against that? Trumbo is presented as the Bernie Sanders of Hollywood. In reality Communism was a bit more dirty than that.
Trumbo stood with Stalin and the oppressive USSR.

This brought to life the length of time and damage that occurred to people in a variety of careers and throughout the country. IA time in our country when our congress may have been at its worst looking for targets who were registered communistic - after WWII. Not unlike how the evil we fought against in WWII began targeting segments of people. The way Trumbo's faith in the system of the USA and its failure to uphold the constitution. How he finds ways to survive and provide for the financial needs of his peers when no one would give them a job.

Not to get political, but it shows that Right Wing Republicans are always on the wrong side of issues-from the 1940-s through today.  They are always ready to be against people who express opinions that they do not like, that they deem anti-American.  It is liberal Democrats that always know what the true meaning and purpose of the First Amendment is.  I think someday that Tea partyers (Trump Supporters) should learn the error of their ways.

Anything that comes out of Hollywood these days you have to take with a grain of salt. They are unabashedly Left. As a independently minded person I always look for the underlining or hidden meaning in a film or artistic work. Like shopping for a coat. What kind of fabric is it made of and how was it assembled or manufactured, and most important by whom? Russian Communism of the 1930-1960's was not the stuff of fairy angels. They were intent on gobbling up the world by spreading intensive hate, fear and systematic breakdown within the Western political democracies. During those times many learned, good logical people naturally moved toward the beauty of Communism as a just and natural way of life. Of course little did they know of the real application of this theory on people's daily lives until it was too late. Over the years since those times there has been and continues to be a mountain of revision and apologies from former communists and others for their earlier unbounded acceptance. In sum learn to search for truth. Digest it. Then forgive and lets move on.",1466899200,2,1244,4.763888888888889

7462151,4,B0167IE0KY,"The bottom of the Hollywood movie pecking order is reserved for the writer. In the beginning there is the ""word."" After WW2 the movie industry was in a panic over real or imagined ""Reds"" among the hired hands, ""progressives"" and ""liberals"" who were OK until 1947 when the Cold War with the USSR began. Screenwriters who had toyed with communism in the 1930s and 40s were suddenly persona non grata, despite their box-office successes. A House committee called a bunch to testify and identify fellow travelers. Some refused on Constitutional grounds, among them iconoclast writer Dalton Trumbo, writer of many successful movies. This film recounts his experience with the government, his peers and the blacklist he evaded by writing under other names, and winning prizes. The film skirts the issue whether or not the blacklisted were really communists [not illegal unitil 1952] or just refuseniks on principle. Cranston carries the movie as the cranky writer who almost lost his career but regained it after the panic subsided.

7462211,4,B0167IE0KY,Good performances - film is too broad and superficially anecdotal. Would have benefited from a tighter focus on a more limited chunk of Trumbo's history. We get walk on cameos by actors portraying famous actors without much fleshing out of their motivations or development of their relationship with Trumbo's. Diane Lane gets very short shrift in her role as the long suffering wife; her role was very under-written. Better explanation of his eccentric habit of screenwriting in the bathtub would have been insightful and more time spent on how he escaped the blacklist would have been nice.,1466899200,,591,5.103092783505154

7462292,5,B0167IE0KY,"When the Oscars rolled around earlier this year, I believe Id seen all of the films with major category nominees.  Except one.  This one.  The film didn't last long, even in the art houses.  And I figured the nominee for best actor (Bryan Cranston) is best known for his television work, especially Breaking Bad, so whats the hurry?  So here I am months later, kicking myself for not seeing one of the best, if not the best performance last year.  Cranston plays Dalton Trumbo, who was probably the most successful screenwriter in Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s, and into the 50s when he won a couple Oscars, one under an assumed name for Roman Holiday.  He served in World War II, and when it was over became a member of the Communist Party.  People soon forgot that Russia was a U. S. ally in the fight against the Axis countries.  And in reality, under Stalin, the country moved into a brutal age, distancing itself from its former partners.  But Trumbo was no Stalin sympathizer, he was more of a union organizer.  In fact, he was quite wealthy which always caused some consternation with Arlen Hird (Louis C. K.) and other like-minded friends.  As the war years grew fainter, Hollywood became less tolerant of communists and their positions.  Called before Congress, Trumbo and 9 of his fellow communists refused to answer questions as to whether they were in the party.  They were sentenced to 3 years in prison.  Afterwards as a celebrity pariah, Trumbo and his friends couldn't find work, blacklisted by the studios who feared they would be brought into the investigation if they hired them.  Or outed by super-patriot gossip columnist, Hedda Hopper (Helen Mirren).  The one exception was King Studios, owned and operated by Frank and Hymie King (John Goodman and Stephen Root).  The studio was noted for terrible B movies with frothy titles and scandalous plots.  They hired Trumbo and he cranked out numerous scripts.  When it got to be too much, he outsourced the work to his fellow blacklisted writers.  Directed by Jay Roach, who has made his living with less serious material (Dinner for Schmucks, Meet the Fockers and the Austin Powers films), gets some great performances from Mirren, Michael Stuhlbarg as Edward G. Robinson, Diane Lane as Trumbos understanding wife Cleo and others.  But this is Cranstons film and his performance is brilliant, providing scenes from tender to raging.  Two come to mind when hes with his daughter Nikola (Madison Wolfe, age 8-11 and Elle Fanning, age 12+).  Nickola asks her dad if she is a communist.  Trumbo answers by giving her an example of what she would do if she had a ham sandwich and one of her less fortunate friends at school was hungry.  In another scene, Trumbo gets hysterical when Niki interrupts his writing routine, she insisting he come to her 16th birthday party.  The film isn't perfect.  It can be ponderously slow at times and the scenes in jail seemed unnecessarily long.  Still, it is an interesting film set in interesting times.  A terrific performance by Cranston makes it all worthwhile.  Recommended.",1466812800,,3082,4.835564053537285

7462296,5,B0167IE0KY,Excellent film. I would recommend it to anyone interested in American History or the life of a screenwriter. The fifties were certainly an era that seemed innocent to anyone who was growing up but so many changes were about to break open. The Red Scare was so apparent. Certainly this family was in the midst of a force bigger than any one person could hope to change. Trumbo is seen as a hero trying to fight for the many but it doesn't work so well for him. The blacklisting was a prevalent story and this movie portrays that well.,1466812800,,533,4.393939393939394

7462303,4,B0167IE0KY,"It covered an interesting (if not shameful) period of American history. The acting was very good, especially Bryan Cranston, Helen Mirren, and John Goodman. I'm not sure how accurately the characters are portrayed. Cranston as Trumbo was believable in my mind and Goodman as a B-movie producer was very good. Without knowing the facts I just had the feeling the film over-emphasized Hedda Hopper's role. That's not a knock on Helen Mirren's acting. The coincidental path-crossing of Trumbo, John Wayne, and Kirk Douglas seemed a little contrived although I'm sure the politics and career ambitions of each character was historically accurate. The Edward G Robinson part was interesting and, if true, sad to see friendship and admiration for talent be sacrificed for career ambitions. The story itself is important to remind us of how fear of outside influences (in this case, Communism) can blind us to common sense and decency.",1466812800,,928,5.193333333333333

7462314,4,B0167IE0KY,"A film that should have been made 50+ years ago to tell the story of the McCarthy era and to reveal the true character of many of Hollywood's most revered legends. The courage generally attributed to some of the most popular was certainly undeserved, it was only an act in front of a camera. Some of the most cowardly were repeatedly cast in larger-than-life rolls that gave them a heroic persona off-screen. Their personal lives demonstrated a complete lack of any willingness to do anything to jeopardize their own position of privilege, even to the point of throwing friends and colleagues under the bus. A shameful period in our country, of which most Americans are unfortunately unaware.

7462320,3,B0167IE0KY,"Bryan Cranston was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Dalton Trumbo, the prolific screenwriter branded a Communist by columnist Hedda Hopper and HUAC and sent to jail for contempt of Congress. Problem is, Cranston plays things in a one-note manner, only getting angry when typing a script in the bathtub and gets interrupted by his daughter's invitation to join her in some birthday cake. The movie cannonizes many of the blacklisted writers and demonizes Hopper, John Wayne, congressmen, and many studio executives. Best part is John Goodman as a shlock, B-moviemaker who  secretly hires Trumbo to write for him under numerous pseudonyms, and who makes one Oscar-winner in the process (The Brave One).",1466812800,,711,5.182608695652174

Of great interest were the roles the characters of that time played in this drama much like what has happened several times since the 1950s.  I now see John Wayne, Kirk Douglas, and Edward G in a whole different way.  Hedda Hopper was a realization that yellow journalism was very much alive back then. Like today, the general population loves to watch the rich and famous and wallow in the excitement of their fall from grace.
I thought Cranston was terrific playing the courageous and diminutive David taking on Goliath politicians and scare mongers. As I watched I wondered when Dana Lane's Cleo would emerge with the strength to slap the word ""family"" back into Dalton, but when she did, it was with the grace and poise of a ballerina.

Cranston's Trumbo is a man of both great intellect AND high ideals who follows those ideals into prison and beyond.
This movie should be mandatory viewing for anyone today following the political battles occurring today in the United States...

The more you know about Kirk Douglas and Spartacus the louder you'll laugh but even if you don't know anything you'll enjoy those scenes. Also Hedda Hopper is spinning in her grave for several reasons including she never looked as good in real life as she does here or have such great hats. She may been famous for her hats but they were as ugly as her character.  Finally, if you want the main character in a movie to be likeable, this isn't the movie for you.

The cast does a solid job with Bryan Cranston as Dalton Trumbo, a blacklisted screenwriter, and first-rate contributions from Helen Mirren and John Goodman, but the film lacks the emotional impact it should have to tell this story faithfully.

Cranston is riveting -- he's so good that even when chewing the scenery, you don't mind. The supporting cast, esp. Helen Mirren and John Goodman, is superb. This film got some so-so reviews, mostly for not being in-depth on the issues enough, but to me, it conveyed the tensions and paralyzing fears of anyone who even attended a Communist Party meeting once out of curiosity.

Dalton Trumbo first hit my radar back in the early 70s when I both read his book, ""Johnny Got His Gun,"" then saw the movie, starring Timothy Bottoms. If you hate fascist repression of creativity and the free expression of political/social views, you'll love this flick. Dalton Trumbo was a complex, talented, intense, and imperfect man. Bryan Cranston does an Oscar-worthy job of playing Trumbo.

7462501,5,B0167IE0KY,"I recommend this movie to everyone. My education skipped over this part of American history and the movie prompted me to undertake research.  Trumbo's speech when he accepted his award from the Screenwriter Guild is important for all times.  (copied below)
""The blacklist was a time of evil, and that no one on either side who survived it came through untouched by evil.  Caught in a situation that had passed beyond the control of mere individuals, each person reacted as his nature, his needs, his convictions, and his particular circumstances compelled him to.  There was bad faith and good, honesty and dishonesty, courage and cowardice, selflessness and opportunism, wisdom and stupidity, good and bad on both sides.
 ""When you who are in your forties or younger look back with curiosity on that dark time, as I think occasionally you should, it will do no good to search for villains or heroes or saints or devils because there were none; there were only victims.  Some suffered less than others, some grew and some diminished, but in the final tally we were all victims because almost without exception each of us felt compelled to say things he did not want to say, to do things that he did not want to do, to deliver and receive wounds he truly did not want to exchange.  That is why none of us - right, left, or centre - emerged from that long nightmare without sin.""",1466726400,,1377,4.6887966804979255

7462536,5,B0167IE0KY,This movie unveils what occurred the during the post WWII Red Scare led by Senator Joseph McCarthy from 1947 -1957. As one of the 'Hollywood Ten' who refused to testify before the House un American Activities Committee the movie follows the life and career of Dalton Trumbo who was one of the most prolific and highest paid screen writers of his time. As a result of refusing to testify Trumbo was  blacklisted for 13 years from 1947 to 1960. During those years he was able to survive by clandestinely writing screen plays under other writers names. Two movies that he wrote during this period 'Roman Holiday in 1953 and the 'Brave One' in 1956 won Academy awards for best screen plays which he was not credited for. He was removed from the blacklist in 1960 with the help of Otto Preminger and Kirk Douglas who produced and starred in Spartacus which he wrote. He was eventually given credit for his earlier works 60 years later. The movie is a snapshot into the history of this country during a troublesome time and shows how some managed to survive through sheer determinism while others succumbed and had their lives ruined.,1466640000,,1128,4.696969696969697
7462537,4,B0167IE0KY,"Enjoyed this movie.  Brian Cranston is really good in this role.  Looks like the man can play just about any character he wants.  Helen Mirren was great as Hedda Hopper.  Made her a great villain. The story itself is well told, but it was such a horrible time in our history it's hard to convey how afraid people were and how willing they were to turn on their friends.  What's so important to stress about this how this country fell into this terrible time so maybe we can avoid it in the future.  But sometimes I see it happening now.",1466640000,,536,4.31

Focus in the film is on the fact that most of those condemned as Russian sympathizers were Jewish, and in one pivotal scene that point is almost too strongly made.

A fine script with rich dialog is carried off by an equally fine cast.  It's a well made film, just a bit too heavily loaded and one-sided to bring it to a higher level of appreciation.",1466553600,2,584,4.542857142857143

7462587,5,B0167IE0KY,"Bryan Cranston, became a childhood favourite of mine as the ridiculous Hal in Malcolm in the Middle. He was relatively unappreciated until establishing himself as an exceptionally talented actor in Breaking Bad.

And so we come to Trumbo. Set during the Cold War, Dalton Trumbo and 9 other screenwriters are called before the House Un-American Activities Committee to testify about their communist links with the Communist Party of the USA, any pro-communism within their productions and the threat they pose towards America.

Despite the amazing performance landing Cranston his first Oscar nomination, sadly he lost out to Leonardo DiCaprio. Who whilst deserved it perhaps for other films, I would argue was almost awarded the prize for 'effort' rather than substance in The Revenant (in my personal opinion)!

A brilliant film looking at the Hollywood Blacklist forcing artists to ghostwrite and lose due credit or compromise their values.",1466553600,,942,5.394557823129252

7462589,5,B0167IE0KY,I really enjoyed this movie.  I remember hearing about the McCarthy era in school and was surprised to hear that it lasted a lot longer than I thought.  I was struck by the fact that our govenment was acting like the thing they claimed they were trying to eradicate.  Demanding that people spy on and name their neighbors and friends in order to save themselves seems like a very Communist thing to do.  They ruined so many lives and became the thing they claimed to hate.  Mr Trumbo managed to come out of it a hero because he held true to his values.,1466553600,,552,4.320388349514563

7462591,4,B0167IE0KY,"The basic premise of the movie has it right. Nobody should ever be deprived of their livelihood because of their political beliefs. In that regard, it's a great movie, albeit from the modern Hollywood viewpoint.

One fact skipped by the movie is that the Communist Party stated in its platform that it believes in the forceful overthrow of the U.S. government. Also, there is no mention that most members of the CPUSA were dupe agents for the Russians. Also, no mention, that as they became aware of what it really meant to be a Communists, many members in the 20's and 30's gave up their memberships, even under the threat of violence from fellow party members. Read Whitaker Chambers ""Witness"" if you can find a copy.

There is also no mention in the film that Communism has been a greater force for evil than any other in human history, greater even than Fascism. Global communism is now credited with the murder of between 80 and 100 million people in the 20th Century. If the Hollywood Communists had known how anti-human Communism really was, I'm sure they would not have been members.",1466553600,,1091,4.706806282722513

Trumbo wrote scores of screenplays that became movie hits. He said he was a Communist and had the group of 10 who supported one another. Then the McCarthy accusations came and off to prison Trumbo went. Edward G Robinson was part of the group but when his movies dried up, he gave names of the group. Helen Mirren as Hedda Hopper was superb. Trumbo's family life was bucolic compared to the Hollywood scene and his wife played by Diane Lane was devoted and steadfast. John Goodman played a sleezy head of a movie company who milked Trumbo for all he could get out of his creative ability.",1466380800,,746,4.609022556390977

7462741,5,B0167IE0KY,"Dalton Trumbo's Hollywood career came to a screeching halt in the wake of his refusal to testify in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee. He, like the other Hollywood Ten, had to devise creative ways to survive the blacklisting, even going so far as to create a kind of writing factory where he wrote B-movies, as well as the Oscar-winning Roman Holiday before Hollywood's ban, was finally lifted.

The focus on Trumbo, a creative and flamboyant Hollywood writer, eliminates some of the Ten to streamline the storytelling, but not the important personalities. There's Hedda Hopper, the Hollywood gossip columnist, who bleeds red, white and blue, Edward G. Robinson, who lost a good chunk of his career to the red scare, John Wayne, who embodied the flag-waving patriotism at war with the Communists and the quiet hero of the piece, Cleo Trumbo, who held her family together despite everything.

In a word, the movie is entertaining. It's not preachy about a shameful period in this country, and Trumbo is at times articulate, irascible and cruel, but always fighting against the injustice of the blacklist and trying to keep body and soul together. The performances are outstanding: Cranston is Trumbo, Helen Mirren deserves more than a tip of the hat for her Hopper portrayal, and Diane Lane maintains the adoration for Trumbo as Cleo, without seeming like a fool or a shrew when he becomes a bear to his family. And, the movie provides great insight into the damage that was done to the lives of those people who saw America a bit differently.",1466380800,,1560,4.927756653992396

7462817,4,B0167IE0KY,"A writer writes, no, better a writer lives to write and to take away that ability to do so is like taking the very oxygen she or he breathes away. Usually writers, wannabe writers, third-rate writers, blocked writers are left to pursue their struggles with language in relative anonymity, in relative peace. But sometimes writers, writers who poke holes in society, who combine their struggle for language with political perspectives run afoul, run way afoul of the social conventions-and pay the price. That paying the price, that running afoul, running way afoul of social conventions in this case to be on the wrong side of the one-size-fits-all anti-communist crusade that burned across the land in America in the post-World War II 1940s and 1950s period, the red scare Cold War night of the title of this review in the case of one Dalton Trumbo the subject of the film under review.

In this space and elsewhere I have poured plenty of cyber-ink about my growing up to adulthood in the red scare Cold War 1950s but except for the comical atomic bomb air-raid drills at school, the demonization of Uncle Joe Stalin and his minions in school and church, and the unease many of felt about what was missing in society in this period I was only on the edges of consciousness about the meaning of the red scare well behind the discoveries of rock and roll, girls and, well sex. That was not the case for those in our parents generation who had perhaps fought as premature anti-fascists in Spain, had spoken out for justice in the Great Depression night or who, to express their solidarities with the downtrodden and oppressed, joined the American Communist Party, or one of their associated organizations. Guys and gals like Dalton Trumbo, the Hollywood Ten, teachers, preachers, labor organizers and the like who when the dime of American and world politics changed in seeming a flash after the was victories got caught in the machinations of every right-wing politician from Richard Nixon to Joe McCarthy who had a sullen list of subversives who must be purged from the body politic.

For a time, a convenient time, those yahoo politicians and their comrades in Hollywood from John Duke Wayne to the spidery Hedda Hopper held a reign of terror on the movie and television industry under the guise of purging communists from the communications and entertainment business. Dalton Trumbo, and most famously the Hollywood Ten of which he was a leading and vocal member, paid the price. Paid the price for what in the end were their ideas, their right to free speech and expression since nobody, no court body ever found any overt act committed against the United States. Paid in no uncertain terms by being forced to testify before Congress about their political affiliations and paying the price with hard time in the bastinado for their refusals. (A year for Trumbo after the appellate process failed.)

Paid too, and this is where the Dalton Trumbo story has all the attributes of, well, a good Hollywood script, with the blacklist, no jobs for the traitors. Ever if these in charge had their ways. But like I said a writer writes and so Trumbo under that imperative (and the imperative of providing for his family as well) organized blacklisted writers into a union. What these blacklisted writers did was write under assumed names, passed in their materials in, got much needed pay, and somebody else took the credit, or didn't get acknowledged. But at least they got to write, maybe not the good stuff although Trumbo did eventually get screen credit for the Oscar-winning screenplay of Roman Holiday. (This front business among blacklisted writers was also the subject of a Woody Allen film, The Front.)

The struggle to get back his right to write is what drives the last part of the film as the ice begins to thaw in the red scare Cold War night. Of course the big event in that struggle for Trumbo was getting the screen credit for Spartacus despite the continued efforts of the night-takers to keep the fires of their reign of terror burning.

For those too young to know, or those like me who were a little too young to appreciate what was going on throughout this benighted land in those days this is a very good up close and personal introduction to the period. This is what I took away from the film though there are times, tough times when some people stand up, stand up like Trumbo, like Dashiell Hammett, like Bogie, and others. There are times, tough times when people like Duke Wayne, Ronald Reagan, Hedda Hopper, ignite the baser instincts of the crowds. There are times, tough times when guys like Edward G. Robinson, Elia Kazin and many others folded, went along with the madness, for the sake of their crummy careers. You don't want to be in the latter two categories. See this film for an example of why that is so.",1466035200,,4837,4.753571428571429

7462825,4,B0167IE0KY,"Though the events are over 60 years past, Trumbo delivers a true message of warning which seems sadly unheeded in today's world, ""Those who will not learn from the past will surely repeat it.""

With wit, powerful performances, and a sharp script Trumbo reminds us of a past we would do well to remember.  Like Jim Crow, Japanese internment camps, and racial inequality, McCarthyism was an attack on the basic rights of American citizens based in ignorance and fear, fear of the diabolical ""Other"" which if not weeded out and destroyed would send our nation crashing into the abyss.

In reality it was merely a distraction, a painful denial of, and vilification of, a particular group used to turn the nation at large from the true problems facing its people in order to keep them under the thumb of a government incapable of truly governing.  And, like the willful child who refuses to attend his lessons, we find ourselves in the grasp of such a failure once more.

While we pour our vitriol upon small, relatively harmless portions of our populace we allow not only the criminalization of the innocent, but also ignore the cries of the truly endangered.  The victims.  We stubbornly refuse to learn our lesson.  We drive ever onward towards a darkness of our own creation.  And all because rather than retrieve from our shameful past the warnings so readily and sickening available, we repeat our follies while the American people pay for our failed education; a failed education of our own making.

Let us now, at long last, learn the lesson.  Let us heed the past.  Let us hear the cry of the ghosts of history and decisively, finally move forward and face our real enemies; ignorance, complacency, and a refusal to give even the smallest mote of common human decency and compassion in favor of a repetition of evils which in this great nation and this earth we share become merely a hell of our own creation.",1465776000,,1913,4.728915662650603

7462914,4,B0167IE0KY,"- characterization by Bryan Cranston of the cranky Hollywood renegade Dalton Trumbo.  While the script itself seems choppy, Cranston's portrayal of a deeply committed, unbending man struggling against the world carries this film over its rough spots.  Unfortunately, the censorship the real-life Trumbo fought did prevail in certain ways: this story is genteelly ignored by mainstream history, with modern movie goers of the Reagan generation blythely ignorant of its events.  One criticism: that in depicting the blacklist era there is an overdwelling on the glamor of Hollywood and its Ten, while slighting the purges sweeping academia, government, business, and labor, which remain in their black holes of neglect.  Thus there will hardly be a film tribute to Owen Lattimore, for instance, the John Hopkins professor of Asian studies who heroically lambasted HUAC and McCarthy personally.

Another glitch: I found the black prison ""mentor"" (played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) unconvincing.  No Negro convict of the period - still rife with Jim Crow, and the persecution of Paul Robeson - would make such ""great country"" statements regarding American society.  This is definitely a modern spin, for whatever reason. Helen Mirren is excellent as the snide, back-stabbing Hedda Hopper.  And John Goodman always plays himself, bringing his light-hearted irony to any given role.

A very good, if not great film, that will hopefully provoke modern audiences as did Trumbo himself.  Anyone familiar with his written work - from the depressing ""Johnny Got His Gun"" to the gruesome ""Night of the Aurochs"" - will understand why a public medium like Hollywood had no place for such literary mavericks.",1462320000,,1695,5.4106463878327

7462937,4,B0167IE0KY,"Cranston deserves 5 stars for his performance but the film falls a little short of that, fizzling out at the end and becoming preachy. There are many confusing parts. Trumbo spent 10 months in prison but he leaves his daughter Nikola as a young girl and returns to see her almost a teenager that he doesn't recognize. We never know what the movie was that Buddy Ross asked him to write the script for. It's a typical inflated script, the fantasy that Hollywood likes to create and pat themselves on the back for. Even so, we enjoyed most of it.

Trumbo's other daughter has said that Kirk Douglas has tried to present himself as the one who single-handedly ended the black list when this is untrue. Is this why he was known as the most hated man in Hollywood? Preminger revealed Trumbo as the writer of Exodus before Douglas said he'd written Spartacus and yet Preminger is given no credit in the film for putting his head in a noose. She said Trumbo himself brought down the list by writing under pseudonyms and helping fellow writers get work under the table.",1461542400,,1061,4.554973821989528

7462962,4,B0167IE0KY,"This movie is the most recent version of the blacklisting of Hollywood movie scriptwriter Dalton Trumbo based on his membership in the communist party. The acting and story are very good and kept my attention throughout the movie. Bryan Cranston, the actor who plays Trumbo, is an excellent casting choice, in my opinion. Helen Mirren is excellent as the right-wing nationalist and anti-semitic Hollywood gossip columnist, Hedda Hopper, who played a major part in creating the Hollywood blacklist and enforcing political and ideological conformity in the movie community. David James Elliott, a lesser-known actor who plays the swaggering right-wing nationalist movie star, John Wayne, also does an excellent job. The movie indicates that John Wayne was (1949-1953) head of the fascistic Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals during the time when it supplied most of the right-biased (i.e. ""friendly"") witnesses to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). The movie portrays good buddies Hopper and Wayne, both members of the MPAPAI, as Republican right-wing bullies who used their considerable influence to threaten Trumbo into either renouncing his leftist pro-labor political beliefs or be blacklisted from working in Hollywood. Trumbo is finally officially outed by his erstwhile friend, the actor Edward G. Robinson, who cooperates with the House Un-American Activities Committee by naming Trumbo in order to protect himself from being blacklisted. While Trumbo awaits the finalization of his trial, it is announced that a fair and objective judge who had influence over the case died and would be replaced with a conservative judge, and, sure enough, Trumbo is sent to prison. What actually happened is that the case was before the Supreme Court when two fair and objective Supreme Court justices died and were replaced with conservatives, shifting the court majority to the conservative side. In one interesting scene when Trumbo is in prison, he meets a black right-wing inmate who, having never met Trumbo before, despises Trumbo based on reports about his being a communist (this black actor would be a good casting choice to play a freedman slave owner in a movie about slavery in the antebellum South, in my opinion). In prison, Trumbo also meets former HUAC Chairman, Congressman J. Parnell Thomas (R-NJ), who was convicted of defrauding the government in an unrelated situation. After Trumbo gets out of prison, the family sell their ranch and, in the movie, they move to Highland Park, California, but, in reality (according to the Wikipedia article), the Trumbo family moved out of the U.S. to Mexico City, where Trumbo wrote the majority of his blacklist-era movie scripts. In the movie, a bad neighbor, who has heard of Trumbo's proscribed political orientation, vandalizes the Trumbo's swimming pool and causes other problems for them, but that would've been very unlikely in Mexico, where the Trumbos actually lived at the time. The movie also portrays Trumbo conducting his business activities on an almost daily basis in Hollywood, which would be unlikely while he lived about 1,550 miles away in Mexico City. In addition to right-wing nationalists Hedda Hopper and John Wayne, the movie correctly identifies the American Legion as a major proponent of the blacklisting of Hollywood leftists. In one scene, Hedda Hopper addresses the American Legion, telling them that the ""communist traitor"" Trumbo is the secret author of a new movie, and the legionnaires reward her with a standing ovation. The Legion has a substantial history of right-wing, anti-labor activism (reportedly was also involved in a plot to overthrow FDR), so Hopper was definitely among good friends. Movie censoring organizations associated with the Catholic church (John Wayne was a right-wing Catholic), such as the Catholic Legion of Decency and  Knights of Columbus, are completely absent from the movie. The so-called Hays Code, and the fact that it was written by a Catholic priest, isn't mentioned. The Catholic Legion of Decency was the main force behind the censoring and blacklisting of various movies and was one of the primary behind-the-scenes instigators of the Hollywood blacklist, so its inclusion in the movie would've been appropriate. Overall, this is a lively, entertaining movie based on fact, but it's fictional to a great extent and pertinent facts are omitted or altered, perhaps due to so much time devoted to the family's activities. Except for one brief mention of the thousands of lives ruined by the blacklist, the movie gives the impression that the Hollywood blacklisting era wasn't really as bad as it's made out to be, at least not for Trumbo. Thanks largely to the efforts of Kirk Douglas and Otto Preminger, Trumbo's social status gets restored and thus the movie gets a happy ending.",1460937600,,4847,5.286640726329442

Btw my fav scene trumbo asks his daughter if she was at lunch and her schoolmate had no lunch wouldn't she give schoolmate part of her lunch?? He was explaining communism to her.

The problem with his explanation is that it's my choice to give not someone else s.

Wasnt Hollywood built on westerns? Didn't john wayne play a role in that? Perhaps a large role? Correction he was a Republican it doesn't count now. How that town turns on its own ( Joan Crawford).

Trumbo was one of the few who actually had been a member of the American Communist Party although he had abandoned it long before the events in the film.  He was deprived of his livelihood by the blacklist after he refused to name other so-called Communists and eventually jailed for contempt of Congress.  Led by Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad) a good cast portrays the blacklist as a product of gossip, tumor mongering, political posturing and score settling by the various players.  As portrayed here Trumbo was something of a secular saint who led resistance to the blacklist, unfailingly stood up for his beliefs, supported his fellow blacklisted writers, loaned people money, loved his family and so forth.  It is a very ernest film and somewhat dull in places.  The result is reasonably watchable although it doesn't tell us anything new about the blacklisting of screenwriters.  Those interested in the subject might like Woody Allen's ""The Front"" - a much more watchable film on the same subject. But omitting Mr. Trumbo).",1459296000,,1190,5.040816326530612

7463049,4,B0167IE0KY,"The era in which this movie is based is one that I had studied in history class many years ago.  I had largely forgotten the various controversies and events that occurred during an era in which you could have just been called a Communist by a neighbor and find a whole community turn on you.  No matter what you view is on the politics of the time or even the politics of today, this is an interesting movie to watch that shows the fears and paranoia created by the Un-American committee and the McCarthy era and what can happen when paranoia runs amok.

Cranston is excellent in the role as Trumbo as well as Hellen Mirren who plays Hedda Hopper.  Most of the supporting cast I think was also good with both Goodman and OGorman being the standouts in their respective roles.  In my opinion is the exception of the actor who played John Wayne, who I think tried to overplay the role a bit. Maybe this is because I have watched nearly all of John Wayne movies growing up as a kid and I found it hard for someone to play one of my favorite actors growing up, I am not sure.

The story itself is well written and does a nice job at providing a balanced view of the time and more importantly shows how we should learn from our past history.  The movie is nicely done that is supported by the strong cast who performs their roles brilliantly with a story that sticks for the most part to events of that time.  Like most movies based on true stories though, there are some things that don't match up to the accuracy of the events but that didn't stop me from enjoying this movie.

The story of Dalton Trumbo's clashes with the anti-Communist hysteria in Congress and Hollywood is a message we may just need to hear in America today, when a different but not so different atmosphere can be perceived in Congress and elsewhere. When people are afraid to speak out for fear of repercussions, we need to hear the story of the Hollywood blacklist once more.

7463106,5,B0167IE0KY,"For anyone old enough to know the name Dalton Trumbo and his unique story as a blacklisted screen writer who beat the system this film will most likely be a treat.
This movie captures the insidious atmosphere of post WWII America and the Red Scare, questionable renegade Senator Joe McCarthy, and the federal government's zealous hunt for subversives.
Played brilliantly by Bryan Cranston, Trumbo has spirit and lots of motivation. He gets knocked down a lot but is never actually out. At times, I forgot I was watching a movie. Guess that's what good actors do-----the audience forgets this is the reenactment of a story. I bought into it fully despite knowing the general narrative. The rest of the cast was spot on, from Helen Mirren's Hedda Hopper to Diane Lane as Trumbo's devoted yet oft frustrated wife.
Great screenplay, photography, and wonderful ensemble casting make this one work. I was pleased to get this on Blu-Ray because it disappeared from select theaters before it made it to full distribution in my area.
This film is pretty consistent with most of the popular 2015 movies. Not a lot of forced melodramatics, just a good story and good acting with a documentary feel.",1458086400,,1187,4.881188118811881

7463207,4,B0167IE0KY,"My husband and I always try to watch as many of the Academy Award nominees as we can, though we often have to wait until they are released on DVD or streaming since we live in a small town and the local theater simply doesn't bring a lot of the nominated titles to town. Such was the case with Trumbo--we rented it the other night on Amazon--I wanted to watch a nominated film but really wasn't in the mood for some of the heavy, dark or depressing subjects covered by some of the other nominees. We will watch them all eventually, but just not that night. I knew from the previews that Trumbo dealt with the Hollywood blacklist era--not an uplifting subject either, but it seemed that Mr. Trumbo had somehow managed to weather the experience. And he did. I felt, just as I always do whenever I watch a documentary or drama about Hollywood blacklisting, that slow burn of outrage, anger at the sheer stupidity and gross unfairness of what was done to these people. In the late seventies my intro political science professor told us, in teaching about the various forms of government, that ALL of them, in their pure forms, were good, workable systems. The problems arose because man was incapable of running a pure system. Democracy certainly fails with flying colors when we examine what happened during the Communist scare witch hunts. People lost their livelihoods. People committed suicide. But in Trumbo we see a man who somehow managed to survive. He and his family suffered and were ostracized, but apparently Trumbo was such a genius that he couldn't be suppressed, and the Hollywood machine recognized his genius  and allowed him to write scripts and contribute, without recognition or adequate payment of course, for decades. And his contributions were impressive. I was surprised (and disappointed) at some of the Hollywood legends who took the party line during the Blacklisting period. Bryan Cranston gives an excellent performance as Trumbo. Good supporting cast as well. Like so many docudramas, perhaps there is a slight lack of dramatic tension--they can only tell what happened--but what happened was pretty horrific. And Trumbo triumphs in the end.

7463259,5,B0167IE0KY,"Dalton Trumbo was a gifted screen writer with a vivid imagination. I understand that he cared for the rights of workers on the set, especially the carpenters, since he understood the amount of money being generated in Hollywood, and everyone should share in the wealth.  But what I don't understand is how he balanced his large ranch, large house with a country lake, his large salary with the fact the he was a communist, believing upon the common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes (basic definition).  I think he was an intellectual, but held an idealistic view of communism, perhaps his own version.  If he would have traveled to Russia or North Korea, I think he would have realized his views did not jive with the reality in those countries, with Stalin murdering a large portion of the population. So, Trumbo is really an enigma, and the movie does its best to portray the strategy used by Trumbo to survive in a time of anti-communism rhetoric in America. It was a pleasure watching Trumbo meet with the King brothers and help them do well in business with his excellent screen plays. John Goodman was perfect for this role, and we also see Kirk Douglas, Otto Preminger, Edward G Robinson, and John Wayne fill in the necessary details to see how the sides were divided in this drama, and Kirk and Otto finally propelling Trumbo into his place as the creative writer that he was.
I don't think we are seeing the entirety of what's happening during that time period, as far as who developed the black list, and how it really devastated families and left a trail of victims. The simple solution for Trumbo was to just come out publicly and say he was not a communist, and enjoy writing and making loads of money. But some people are just stubborn, since communism is a failed ideology.  There will always be people who exploit the system, exactly what happened in the Soviet Union.
Bryan Cranston is excellent as usual, John Goodman is golden, Helen Mirren spectacular, Diane lane gorgeous.  I think that Louis C K was miscast and it was evident in the scenes with Bryan Cranston, the master of his craft and a true master Thesbian.
Overall, go see this movie and learn of the turbulent times of Hollywood Blacklisting.  Enjoy, you will not be disappointed.",1457308800,,2298,4.689826302729529

Robinson to some effect. Helen Mirren stole the show as Hedda Hopper, In my opinion. Her American accent was dead on, and she definitely lived the part.

Of all the reasons that made me want to buy and watch the movie, none was satisfactorily addressed.  Why was Trumbo so dedicated to the communist party, while also so wedded to an upper middle class life? Dunno.

7463319,5,B0167IE0KY,"Jay Roach's ""Trumbo"" is an example of top-notch film entertainment that falls a mile short of being a work of cinematic art.

Admittedly, my love for this film is unabashed.  One reason I like it so much is that it has an important subject usually not covered well in movies: the Hollywood Blacklist, a result of Congressional hearings held by the House Un-American Activities Committee during the 1950s to purportedly weed out communists -- but, more accurately, by ambitious partisan Republicans to suppress liberal themes (unionism, civil rights, progressive ideas) from being portrayed in the movies.  From the subsequent 'inquisitions' there were countless victims, and not just human lives but also the freedoms Americans are supposed to take for granted.  Screenwriter Dalton Trumbo was one of the few who survived those years selling scripts using 'fronts,' i.e., paying other writers for the use of their names.

From this very important subject, screenwriter John McNamara and director Jay Roach has made a highly enjoyable film on every level.  I found the cast excellent (the great Bryan Cranston, though somewhat hammy as Trumbo, as well as supporting players Diane Lane, Helen Mirren, John Goodman and Louis C.K.), and, even though other critics found flaws in the screenplay to bitch about, I respected its script for deftly compacting and organizing the narrative events to make its history clear to those who don't know the period.  And for those who do know the period well, the film is a delight, if a modified one.

Though I cannot say it deserves to be any kind of Oscar winner, I feel no guilt in unequivocally recommending it.",1457222400,,1649,5.059040590405904
7463320,2,B0167IE0KY,Cranston was good but the movie was boreing,1457136000,,43,4.5
7463321,5,B0167IE0KY,"Im fortunate to have had a chance to purchase the book Trumbo in 2015 (the move in tie in edition by Bruce Cook) as well as the 2008 documentary on Trumbo.  As a result, I was greatly interested in the movie and I only wished that I would have watched it sooner. The first reason; There are a wide range of actors/actresses who contribute to this plot, and as a result it would take up more than two paragraphs to give justice to explaining the roles and plots. However, I intuitively feel fine with saying this; The characters of Dalton Trumbo (Bryan Cranston) and Cleo Trumbo (Diane Lane) are shown having an enduring marriage and a strong family with their kids (the kids of various ages are played by Madison Wolfe, Toby Nichols, Meghan Wolfe,Mitchell Zakocs, Elle Fanning,Mattie Liptak, Becca Nicole Preston, John Mark Skinner as per Internet Movie Database online ) despite what they are put through from the professional power and significant influence of Hedda Hopper (Helen Mirren) and also seeing one of his close friends Arlen Hird (Louis C.K.) suffer greatly in his life. Eerily, I looked up a little information on Hedda Hooper and noticed that her son died just a few years after her. Fortunately, the characters of Frank King (John Goodman) and Hymie King (Stephen Root) become pivotal in Trumbos life to his professional growth.  There are also other actors and actresses that tremendously weave into the plot details of the Trumbo movie, yet I must refrain from saying more out of consideration for others who have not yet seen the 2015 Trumbo movie.",1457136000,,1567,4.8

7463323,4,B0167IE0KY,Well acted with an intelligent script make this movie a potent reminder of a bad time in America which cost many people their livelihood and even their lives,1457136000,,157,4.642857142857143
7463324,5,B0167IE0KY,"You cannot take your eyes off of Bryan Cranston. His inner dialog is always running and that is an incredible treat for discerning film consumers. The script is fantastic, which, because the film is about talented writers, makes the whole thing even more enjoyable. Lewis CK and Bryan Cranston play 2 blacklisted writers ( among many) and Lewis CK has several of the greatest 1 liner deliveries I have seen in a long time. Bravo!  They had such chemistry I found myself always waiting for the next exchange. Besides that, the story is amazing and well written. The historical facts are riveting. All of the acting is great.

As a side note, I thought it touched on ( maybe not enough?) the differentiation between people's concepts of what Communism actually was. There is still a lack of understanding surrounding this issue. There were people who were communists in the USA simply because they believed that poor people should be cared for with compassion, that people had basic rights, and that it was wrong to let a few elitists destroy and dominate others with less money, and that unions that fought for the worker should be supported. These are all decent ideas and when Fascism was on the rise in Europe, many sane and compassionate Americans looked into communism as a counter response. They had no interest in Russia or that brutal form of communism ( that was really Fascism in disguise). They were not traitors and they loved the USA and were not consumed by a fanatical dogma. On the other side there were more extreme communists who believed that to have anything of your own or luxurious was to betray your cause. The actor Lewis CK 's character accuses Trumbo of this when he reprimands Trumbo for having a swimming pool. But then, there are the Fascists of our American government who ( behaving exactly like the Fascists in Russia and Nazi Germany ) consolidated absolute power among their little ignorant selves and were able to grant themselves the ability to destroy people. To me this film is also an enjoyable expose of those people, John Wayne among them.

It's also a delicious tale of Trumbo's triumph. I love this film.",1457049600,,2146,4.763440860215054

I was disappointed that the story of one of Hollywood's most acclaimed screenwriters was so flat.  There is little to recommend it cinematically; it's a prosaic, straightforward recounting of events.  If the concept was to relate a 1950's story in a 1950's style it may have succeeded - but more in a ""Here Come the Nelsons"" not ""On the Waterfront"" way.  Helen Mirren is the best thing in the movie.  Gave it a second star because it attempted to tackle an important topic.  In a world of Adam Sandler movies and other drivel it probably deserves four stars but for viewers who are selective and value the art ""Trumbo"" could have been so much better",1456963200,,809,4.6879432624113475

7463419,5,B0167IE0KY,"One of the Hollywood Ten, Trumbo went to prison for refusing to answer questions by the House Un-American Activities Committee, which was trying to root out communism in the motion picture industry.  Others were pressured to name names or suffer the same fate.  How many people would have done what Trumbo and the others did - stand firm for their constitutional rights.
With the current election rhetoric, it's a timely reminder as to how power-mongers and politicians use fear to keep the masses obediently toeing the line, afraid to speak up or question so-called authority.
That people think McCarthyism could never happen again should think twice about that.

7463512,5,B0167IE0KY,"This is one side of true events.  For instance, Kirk Douglas's book about the making of Spartacus differs somewhat from this movie so don't take everything you see as being what really happened.  In the '30s and '40s a lot of the Hollywood movie people joined the American Communist Party but there wasn't much attention paid to them until after WW II and the Cold War between Russia and the USA heated up.  If you were old enough to remember the '50s and '60s then you remember it.  After the war Russia was ruled by Stalin who killed 20 million of his own people so we knew he wouldn't hesitate to nuke us if he thought he could get away with it.  When he died he was succeeded by Khrushchev who promised to bury us and appeared to be just as likely to launch the missiles as Stalin was. That created a lot of fear and anti-Communist sentiment in this country and some people went way overboard in their persecution of the perceived threat they posed.  A blacklist was made of Hollywood people even suspected of sympathizing with the Communists.  Trumbo was a top screenwriter when he was blacklisted when he refused to name names.  A system started where these blacklist writers still did the writing but other people took credit for it.  It was an open secret that allowed the studios to keep making movies that people wanted to see while seeming to comply with the ban.  I particularly enjoyed seeing the portrayal of the Hollywood people that I grew up with, all gone now except for Douglas, but younger people probably won't know who some of them are.  This isn't an action movie, no car chases and no shootouts, just a lot of good acting.",1456531200,35,1646,4.508417508417509

7463561,1,B0167IE0KY,"This is another one of those totally fictional films about real people and real events. Dalton Trumbo was a real person, but the film wildly distorts almost everything about him and the events in his life. The film starts off with an immediate Capitulation. Rather than stand up for what Trumbo actually believed, the film kicks off with the statement that people joined the communist party because of nazis and the depression. The film is basically making the concession that people like Trumbo were misguided or their involvement with the party was just a matter of historical circumstance. Then the film tries to position the beliefs of Trumbo and others to all be about postwar hollywood strikes which is also totally wrong. The problem with the film is that its dishonest and cowardly at its core. The creators didn't like the blacklist, but from the finished film it didn't seem like they much liked the real Trumbo or what he stood for either.

The film has Trumbo confront John Wayne about Wayne's not having served in the war. The problem with that was that Trumbo didn't serve either though the film tries to suggest that he did. Trumbo was an anti-war activist and the most he ever did was participate in a south pacific film junket late in the war. ""Eddie"" as well was another war tourist. Hedda Hopper's son did fight with distinction in the war, but he wasn't exactly a supporter of Trumbo. As well Trumbo was in the early 1940s an isolationist if not an outright pacifist. There is a case for going after John Wayne, but the people in the scene are not the people. Its a gross distortion of who these people were. And ultimately, nothing like this ever happened. Time and again in the film, history is replaced with fantasy. One would think there is more than enough ugly human history in the blacklist period to fill any number of screenplays without having to resort to simply making things up.

Another example. Rather than being a staunch republican and anti-communist, MGM studio boss Louis B. Mayer is shown to be a victim of anti-semitism in the blacklist period. In another made-up scene, Hedda Hopper confronts and threatens him directly in a very ugly way. Its beyond odd that a film about HUAC and the blacklist would trying to make the boss of MGM into a victim against the truth of the historical record, but that is what this film does.

The film outright slanders the name and memory of Edward G. Robinson. History is rewritten to make him into a full cooperating witness with the committee including the naming of names. That is a gross distortion of actual events and as well ignores the fact that Robinson suffered considerable personal consequences. Of course what can you when the film presents with a straight face the idea that John Wayne and Hedda Hopper were the all-powerful super-bosses of hollywood.

The rest of the Hollywood ten?  The film didn't seem to like them much so it replaced them dramatically with a single character created for the film named  ""Arlen Hird"". The technique allows them to again rewrite the actual history however they please. Often the main purpose of the ""Hird"" character seems to be to make Trumbo out to be moderate. That while he was a party member he wasn't one of _those people_.

Much of the later parts of the film concern themselves with Kirk Douglas. Beyond its war on history, the other great problem of the film is its obsession with ""stars"" and hollywood. To a large extent, the title character is peripheral to his own story. Trumbo is constantly played as kind of a harmless apolitical folksy family man. That is very much at odds with the real Trumbo. The film goes after Otto Preminger in a really ugly way for unclear reasons. The worst people who did the worst things during the period don't generally even rate a mention.

Cranston's performance gets praise from many people. Thought I don't see it. He plays Trumbo like Disney's old animatronic Abe Lincoln or one of those old one-man Broadway shows about a famous character in history. The portrayal is pleasant and affable, but everything about the real man is bled out of it.

Behind the film is the director of the Austin Powers films and a TV writer who had never done serious drama or a feature before. For some reason, they bought the rights to Bruce Cook's 1977 autobiography of Trumbo and then promptly ignored every word of it.

I think that the person who the film would anger the most if he were still around to see it would be Trumbo himself. If Robinson were still alive, he would probably have brought a libel suit against the film and probably won.",1456099200,38,4605,4.6810877626699625

But from what I've read--and in fairness it was because the movie was so compelling I wanted to know more--the film was oversimplified to the point of inaccuracy.  Why was Edward G. Robinson singled out for ""naming names"" before HUAC, something he did not do (although he did repudiate several organizations he had supported financially, with what justification I don't know)?  There was certainly enough bad behavior to go around without making more up.  Robinson is dead, probably many young people have no idea who he was, and all they will remember now is--""Oh, yeah, the guy that named Dalton Trumbo.""  It seems an unnecessary cruelty--and its dishonesty makes one wonder about how accurately the rest of the movie is presented.

7463572,5,B0167IE0KY,"In an Oscar season where it seems like an ""historical inevitability"" (to quote Edward Albee) that Leo will win the Best Actor award, it is a damn shame that Bryan Cranston's insanely good performance here will not win. Or will it? Overall, I think this is a good or very good film, elevated by a performance that one could use as a master class in how to act in Film, or at least how to act in an American historical epic, self-referentially about Hollywood's not so Golden Age. To say Cranston inhabits the role is to really not give him enough credit, but he quite literally becomes the Witch Hunt Era hero Dalton Trumbo, in all of his chain smoking, irreverant glory. Or, he becomes a construction of Trumbo that Cranston as an actor creates, which is just as good, or perhaps better. If that weren't good enough, see Trumbo because the Casting Director him/herself deserves an Oscar for finding a slew of very high quality, relatively unknown actors and actresses to play an assortment of Hollywood Good Guys (and Dolls) and Bad Guys. I don't konw the actor who plays Otto Preminger but he just about steals the show, as does the always wonderful John Goodman in a scene-chewing performance as a second-rate B Movie Producer which should have netted him a Best Supporting nod. I could go on, like talk about how marvelous the notoriously difficult-to-work-with Diane Lane is as Trumbo's wife, but the real brilliance of Trumbo is that it is a well-crafted and well-acted History lesson about one of the sorriest times this Country has ever lived through - which, eerily, bears a lot of similarity to the Times we live in now. It is almost like Hollywood is trying to make reparations to the many lives, including Trumbo's which were ruined by the hyper Right Wing paranoia of the Red Scare -- and the Institution of Hollywood's relatively feeble response -- but that would diminish the accomplishment of Trumbo as the great film it is. Regardless of your Political leanings, you will love Dalton Trumbo after seeing this great biopic.",1455926400,11,2038,4.743661971830986

7463581,4,B0167IE0KY,"What makes TRUMBO shine is Bryan Cranston's remarkable, quirky portrayal of blacklisted Hollywood screenwriter Dalton Trumbo. Trumbo was once Hollywood's highest paid screenwriter with a string of hit movies until he and other writers, actors and directors were blacklisted in Hollywood for being communists. Trumbo and others even served time in prison for ""contempt of Congress"" after giving vague answers when called before the House Un-American Activities Committee.
TRUMBO portrays a tragic time in American history where lives and careers were ruined because of political beliefs. One could make comparisons to the current world and the fight against terrorism. In the 1940's and 1950's it was communism that struck fear in the hearts of millions of Americans.  The Soviet version of communism was perceived as the world threat to humanity. Nuclear war was within reach and paranoia swept the nation.
The film TRUMBO tries to recreate this era of fear and injustice. The settings and costumes are a step back in time. The actors are brilliant in their roles. Cranston as Trumbo, Diane Lane as Trumbo's long suffering wife Cleo, Helen Mirren as the vile newspaper columnist Hedda Hopper and even Louis C.K. in a remarkably fine dramatic role.
It's funny watching Cranston's face and reactions and distinct mannerisms. Was the real Trumbo this quirky? Although Trumbo seems to be portrayed as an honest idealist, we never really get an understanding of why he and the other blacklisted artists were willing to go to jail for their beliefs. What were there beliefs? There are references to fighting for fair wages and decent working conditions for employees of the motion picture industry. Unfortunately, TRUMBO is sorely lacking in depth at times. Trumbo tries to explain to his daughter that she would be a communist because she would want to share her favorite sandwich with a friend who had no sandwich at all. C.K.'s character once points out that Trumbo can't be much of communist if he lives in a fancy and expensive home full of luxuries.

There is so much to explore here that is overlooked. The theme here seems to be freedom of speech and freedom of believes. The beliefs of the blacklisted writers are never clearly spelled out. No doubt many of the blacklisted artists suffered through guilt by association and were not communists in any sense of the world. There is so much more to the story that needs to be explored.
Eventually, politics and beliefs go by the wayside and Trumbo concocts a way for him and his friends to skirt the blacklist by simply using fake names. Hence, Dalton won the best screenwriter for THE BRAVE ONE but under the name Robert Rich. Finally, humor fills the screen as the blacklisted writers secretly go back to work.
Some of the fun in this film is watching actors portray classic stars such as John Wayne, Edward G. Robinson and Kirk Douglas. There are clips showing Ronald Reagan testifying intersperses with actor portrayals. As far as I know, Kirk Douglas is the only major player in this film (outside of Trumbos children) who is still alive. He is portrayed as a hero and righter of wrongs. Did the studio need his permission to have him portrayed in the film?
Helen Mirren is the divinely wicked Hedda Hopper who seems to hold the fate of actors in her hands as she is bent on destroyed careers. Here is a woman whose story would be fascinating on its own.
TRUMBO is a great film but not without many flaws. Trumbo is idealized as a saint but his exact political believes are never clear. Was he a hero or a villain or just a normal man caught up in the insanity of the times?
The real Trumbo is seen in a clip during the credits. It was a disappointment that that bonus features didn't explore the real Trumbo and the events of the day.
TRUMBO is worth watching to get a piece of American history and to see one of Americas great and under-appreciated actors Bryan Cranston in action.",1455840000,4,3938,4.8067846607669615

7463585,5,B0167IE0KY,"What I know of Trumbo I learned from this film. I'm new to this story, not even viewing the previous film version of 2009. I did NOT research the biographical Internet truth available on Trumbo. I simply like period stories and this has a pile of good actors and I was actually alive through most of the period, thus I bought a copy for enjoyment. Although I can't confirm specific points, I'm guessing most of the facts are true and I learned a bit from the film. More importantly, I thoroughly enjoyed the performance and the storytelling DVD. If it didn't happen exactly as depicted, I can imagine it was fairly close. I do know much of the political fervor of the 50s against Communism was real. I did the drill as a child, at school, crawled under my desk with hand over my head until the ""all clear"" was given and once again I knew I would not be nuked to death. Just a part of growing up in the 1950s, along with tornado drills, fire drills, and rock-n-roll.

It is obvious to most of us who lived through the time, the Commie threat was over-expressed most of the time. My parents had an underground shelter, wow. It was converted to Christmas decorations storage in the 1970s. Some used Communism as a means for gaining USA notoriety, so it's easy enough to believe what happened to Trumbo. Yet I do not condone him, if you want to be an elephant, live with the elephants.
That said, I give this fine period story 5 stars for entertaining historic drama performed by some fine people, and more kudos offered for sets, props, costumes, writing, directing, and cinematography.

7463587,5,B0167IE0KY,"Trumbo is a great film, but a serious film about a critical era in this nations history, another era not too different from today, where the hysteria of ""Anti-Communism"" has been replaced by the hysteria of ""Anti-Terrorism' . The film is a great message promoting FREE SPEECH, opinion, and expression.
Having lived through the 50's and 60's, I have a perspective on both era's today's and yesterday's ... some lessons need to be learned and taught over and again. It was the perceptive author and historian George Santyana who wrote: ""Those who fail to learn the lessons of the past are doomed to relive them.
And here we are, reliving the same nonsense over again.

""Some things are overlooked, of course, such as Daltons slavish loyalty to Stalin from the late 1930s until the Caligula in the Kremlin died in 1953. Stalin may not have been perfect, Trumbo would later admit, while insisting that the serial killer in Moscow had done wonders as he preserves, maintains and develops socialism.

""His embrace of Adolf Hitler is also nicely airbrushed. During the 22 months of the Hitler-Stalin pact, Dalton sided with the Fuehrer as he attacked Poland, stormed across Western Europe and then blitzed London in preparation for a cross-channel invasion. Dalton mobilized his polemical skills to ease Hitlers burden of conquest by demonizing his enemies and insisting that England was just not worthy of assistance.

""He even accused FDR of treason and black treason for aiding the British in their hour of peril. That was the party line from Moscow, which Dalton emphatically echoed. Not until the Nazis marched on Russia in 1941 did he find the German warlord a major disappointment.

""Nor do the movie makers let us in on Trumbos warm embrace of Kim Il-Sungs North Korea when it attacked South Korea in June 1950 with critical Soviet support. American soldiers sustained thousands of casualties in rescuing the South from Communist conquest, but Dalton decided to write a snarky little poem trashing Americas intervention, as if we had initiated the slaughter. It goes like this:
Have we hurt you, little boy?/ Ah, . . . we have/ Weve hurt you terribly/ Weve killed you/ Hear then, little corpse . . . it had to be/ Poor consolation, yet it had to be/ The Christian ethic was at stake/ And western culture and the American way/ and so, in the midst of pure and holy strife,/ We had to take your little eastern life.

""Channeling his inner Stalin, he also wrote a screenplay  egged on by some of his Hollywood Ten friends  in which the major character, Catherine Bonham, reveals her ardent attachment to North Korea. Bonham insists Kims country is a model Asian nation and is fighting for its freedom just as we had to fight for our own independence in 1776.

""The authentic Trumbo, not the Botoxed movie version, used his inexhaustible supply of energy to advance not the First Amendment but totalitarian Communism. He secretly joined the Kremlin-controlled Communist Party in 1943 but conceded to biographer Bruce Cook in the 1970s that he might as well have been a Communist ten years earlier and that he never regretted it. He loved the party so much that, after serving a prison term for contempt of Congress and a sojourn in Mexico, he reaffiliated with the Party in 1954 and then left the party in 1956.

""For approximately two decades, Trumbo was secretly working for the Evil Emperor. But his pro-Soviet views were hardly hidden when in 1945 he became editor of The Screen Writer, the official publication of the powerful Screen Writers Guild, transforming that influential monthly into a virtual Red propaganda organ, with the aid of CP members Gordon Kahn (managing editor) and Harold J. Salemson (editorial secretary). Virtually everything Red was celebrated, including Communist lectures, Communist obituaries, the Soviet film industry, Red-run unions and guilds, party screenwriters and even Stalin himself.

""By 1947, Americans knew that Stalin was our deadly enemy. But Dalton and the rest of his Hollywood Ten crew were colluding with the Kremlin to do this country in, which the much maligned HUAC proved beyond reasonable dispute. For this reason only, the studios blacklisted those Soviet fifth columnists who worked long and hard and covertly for a Stalinist America.""

Nor was he anti-war unless it suited the Reds. Ron Radosh reminds us: ""Back in 1939, Trumbo had written a major anti-war novel that received favorable reviews, Johnny Got His Gun. The book came out during the infamous Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and was serialized in The Daily Worker, the Communist partys newspaper. When Germany broke the pact and invaded the USSR on June 22, 1941, Trumbo withdrew the book from circulation, and copies that had been sent to bookstores were ordered returned. Disappointed readers wrote to Trumbo asking where they could obtain the novel to read. Trumbo invited the FBI to come to his home and gave them the names of those who had written to him requesting a copy of his book. The right wing, he told them, wanted to make his own censorship of the novel a civil liberties issue. So he informed on them, telling the agents that he feared they might be acting politically and might even oppose FDR.""

Pat Buchanan informs us that ""between 1946 and 1950, Stalin murdered the Russian POWs we sent back in Operation Keelhaul, imposed his barbarous rule on 10 Christian nations of Eastern Europe, blockaded Berlin, built an atom bomb with the aid of American traitors Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, helped Mao Zedong conquer China and begin a slaughter of Chinese that would exceed the millions attributed to Stalin himself.

""In 1950, Stalin backed Kim Il-Sungs invasion of South Korea that left millions dead, including 33,000 Americans. The film script, An American Story, found in Trumbos papers, reveals deep sympathy for North Korea during that war."" For context, Trumbo later admitted that he knew of the millions who were being killed under Stalin.

Why anyone would celebrate this man is a mystery. But the relentless history-rewriting machine is on overtime in this movie.",1455667200,10,5780,4.976165803108808

During the post WWII red scare Congress began a witch hunt for communists. The movie industry was one of the hardest hit and many actors, writers and directors were blacklisted from being able to work. Trumbo was one of them. Trumbo and the rest of the Hollywood 10 fight back the only way they know how. They write under false names, this seemingly innocent act begins to change everything. I absolutely loved this movie. This was a true story with politics thrown in. Right up my alley. Much like other movies dealing with this subject like Goodnight and Good luck and even the Majestic the movie makes you mad and wonder how people though this was OK when it was happening. You really root for Trumbo and his friends to succeed. Unlike some movies like this that involve people you have never heard of Trumbo may not be recognizable but his work is. This writer wrote Roman Holiday and Spartacus, just to name a few. I could go on and on about this but this is just a great movie that I highly recommend. One of the best of the year.

7463598,2,B0167IE0KY,"Have you noticed how there are certain topics Hollywood does NOT want to get into?
It would be possible to make a fascinating film showing the activities of screenwriter Dalton Trumbo and other Hollywood communists when their politics were fashionable. You could show how they started the first Hollywood blacklist - which is why before 1946 no studio film could even hint at anything less than flattering to Stalin and his gang. And it would certainly hold the audience's attention to show how Trumbo and friends effectively supported Nazi Germany from September 1939 until June 22, 1941 when Hitler ended his alliance by Stalin with invading Russia. You could even show how Trumbo ratted people out to the FBI whom he considered to be ""isolationists"" after the Party line shifted 180 degrees on that point. But the chance of Hollywood making that movie is about the same as the odds of an Arab being elected prime minister of Israel.
Instead we have this film - which expects you to believe that Trumbo and his fellow communists refused to testify on their activities in order to demonstrate their deep love of our Constitution.
The truth is that all of these people were under Party discipline and belonged to an organization which took all of its instructions from Moscow. It was not (and never has been) illegal to belong to or support the C.P.U.S.A. As for ""naming names,"" all the names were already known to the FBI. Any reputable lawyer would have told Trumbo that he could plead the Fifth Amendment and refuse to answer questions, and could never be found in contempt of Congress for that. But the Party never could pass up an opportunity for propaganda work. That's why Trumbo and fellow communists were willing to run the risk of going to jail by NOT taking the legal means which would have allowed them to avoid saying anything. As for putting their wives and children at risk of impoverishment - well, communists world wide have a rather impressive record of promoting impoverishment.
On some other matters of note. If you are interested in how scripts move from a typewriter to a movie set, you won't find out from this film. Most scripts are collaborative efforts and people involved are often uncredited. Also, even a small change in a script can change a scene completely. A one percent change can be the difference between mediocrity and genius - and it is probably the mediocrity who wrote the credited 99 percent and the genius who goes uncredited. Regardless of that, one can be a writer of genius, or an actor, or a director, and still be a complete [insert name of Amazon CEO and flush twice!] as a human being. Look at Roman Polanski.
I give this picture two stars because the performances are all first rate. Cranston is always good. I love Diane Lane and wish we could see more of her. Helen Mirren is jaw dropping as Hedda Hopper - especially in one scene with Louis B. Meyer. I don't know if that ever happened in real life, but it should have.",1454976000,8,2972,4.695402298850575

7463600,4,B0167IE0KY,"Nine Things about ""Trumbo""

1. There aren't very many Hollywood movies about screenwriters. For some reason they are mostly ignored. This movie is one you want to pay attention to.

2. This movie is about the infamous Hollywood blacklist. It's based on the real career of Dalton Trumbo, an extremely talented screenwriter who went to prison and was blocked from working in Hollywood because he became a Communist.

3. When Hollywood makes a political movie, you already know who the good guys and bad guys are. The same goes here. Trumbo is portrayed as an idealist, a man who wants equal pay for equal work for everyone. He's almost a martyr for having unpopular beliefs and joining a political party that was completely legal. I don't know Trumbo's biography, but I know enough about life (and Hollywood) that I don't think we're getting the full story.

4. To its credit, the movie does kind of call out Trumbo for wanting everyone to be treated equally, while still wanting his huge house with a lake on it.

The movie also does a decent job of explaining all the positions of this issue, and takes the stance that there were no good guys or bad guys here, just victims. You may or may not agree with that stance, though.

5. It is really interesting to see other Hollywood legends be personified in the movie, such as Edward G. Robinson, John Wayne, Otto Preminger and Kirk Douglas. It was more interesting to see the sides they took on the whole mess, and how classic movies such as Spartacus and Exodus helped undermine the blacklist.
gossip columnist Hedda Hopper as an exquisite bitch. And John Goodman is always gold, even if he usually plays the same basic character. Here he's the head of King Brothers Productions, chewing his way through every scene he's in, like I imagine the real Frank King might have.

7. The movie is obviously over-simplified, especially to make such a complicated topic fit into two hours. But the advantage to that is that it is also understandable for anybody who didn't even know there was such a thing as a Communist blacklist in Hollywood. It's accurate enough to get a basic education on the topic.

8. It was directed by Jay Roach, who is famous for the Austin Powers movies and Meet the Parents. But he has also directed several political films, such as Recount and Game Change, for HBO. Political and social conservatives tend to not like his films very much, and Trumbo won't change their mind.

9. Like most Hollywood renditions of history, this one has some problems. But that's really not the point of this movie. The main idea behind this film is to remind us of the weakness of democracy, when a majority of people can gang up on a minority of people and cause a lot of suffering. It's a lesson that we need to always keep in front of us.",1453507200,137,2791,4.610887096774194
7463601,5,B0167IE0KY,"Dalton Trumbos story is a complicated one, even for the post-War 1940s era. He was a Hollywood screen-writer and a novelist who was conscientious and always spoke his mind. His anti-war novel Johnny Got His Gun, written in 1939, was turned into a movie in 1971 by Trumbo himself in the directors seat, with the story still resonating  today with the casualties from the Neocon Wars.

He was also fond of Communism as an ideal for better treatment of the lower social classes in America, especially after some people had lost everything in The Great Depression (which itself has been blamed on Banking sector/ and the Federal Reserve policy by a major competing theory) and some being mistreated due to Segregation. Yet, knowingly or unknowingly, he found himself aligned with and defending the Stalinist Russia at a time when the Soviets were murdering their own citizens (Millions died during the Red Terror, the Great Purge, and the infamous Gulag labor camps).

However, he never did anything other than exercise his right to free speech under the First Amendment. But, he was black-listed from doing any work in Hollywood that was under pressure from a bullying Congress. This legislative branch of our government also violated his Fifth Amendment Right not to self-incriminate by jailing him for almost a year under the guise of ""contempt"" when he refused to discuss his ideology. Its noteworthy that President Truman and the Supreme Court remained shamefully silent when this witch-hunting was taking place.

This is the best movie Ive seen in this past year. Its well-written, superbly-acted, full of mature humor without sacrificing the seriousness of its subject matter, and deeply-touching on many levels. It is more emotional than Carol, more mind-boggling than The Big Short, and, may I dare say it, more entertaining that Hateful 8. Bryan Cranston shines as the protagonist just as he did in Breaking Bad, and really deserves the Oscar. Helen Mirren is perfect as the devilish gossip columnist, and John Goodman delivers a tour de force performance not seen since The Big Lebowski. There is also some documentary footage in the end credits.

It is more than just entertainment with an excellent cast and story that needs to be told. It opens your eyes to an American History that is still relevant and unfortunately re-occurring  today (media censorship, political influence, abuse of power, racism, banking deregulation, and pressuring an entire group of people because of their identity). This movie is, above all, about what it means to be an American and what it means to exercise your unalienable Constitutional Rights. Its a shame not many theaters have been showing it.

I was pleasantly surprised to learn people like John Huston, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall supported Trumbo (and others like Chaplin and Orson Wells) by forming The Committee for the First Amendment, whose other members included Kirk Douglas, Burt Lancaster, Frank Sinatra, Lucille Ball, Bette Davis, Judy Garland, Ira Gershwin, Katharine Hepburn, Henry Fonda, Gene Kelly, Groucho Marx, and Billy Wilder. I was horrified to find the opponents of free speech (i.e. supporters of McCarthyism) included Walt Disney, James Stewart, Elia Kazan, Ronald Reagan and John Wayne, although the latter two are not really a big surprise.",1452988800,11,3319,5.157992565055762

8735762,5,B0167IE0KY,"During World War II, both the United States and the Soviet Union were basically on the same side, fighting the fascism of Hitler and Mussolini.  But once that war was won, a new war beganbetween the two former allies.  By the late 1940s, there was hysteria sweeping America that there was a Soviet spy or somebody with Communist persuasions under everyones bed; and that hysteria escalated to paranoia when it reached Hollywood.  Anyone in the movie industry, be they writers, actors, directors, or craftspeople, were basically purged from Hollywood if they were found out to have had any connections to Communism, and were put on a morally ugly blacklist.  The biggest fish of all among Hollywood screenwriters was Dalton Trumbo, who was an admitted Communist only because he led the fight for equal pay for workers in Hollywood.  His story was told quite brilliantly in the 2015 biopic TRUMBO.

Based on Bruce Cooks bio, TRUMBO stars Bryan Cranston stars as Trumbo, whose refusal to answer questions about his membership to the onerous House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947 led him and other writers to be blacklisted, even as some of their fellow Hollywood colleagues turned on Trumbo and others to cover their own asses and save their careers from certain disaster.  Cheerleading the Good Fight against Godless communists were Hollywood gossip columnist Hedda Hopper (Helen Mirren) and screen icon John Wayne (David James Elliott), who at the height of his career was a major cheerleader for our troops in World War II but who, unlike many of his fellow actors, both Communists and non-Communists alike, did not put money where his mouth was and fight in that war.  Cranston spends a couple of years in jail; but even when he is released, he notices that the Hollywood blacklist is still very much alive and well into the early 1950s; and with the ascendancy of unsavory political hacks like Joe McCarthy and Richard Nixon, may be even worse than before.  As a result, he becomes a workaholic of the highest order, trying to get back into the business that abandoned him by writing screenplays under pseudonyms (which a lot of Hollywood personas did during that time), but alienating himself from his wife (Lane) and kids.  Eventually, however, under the pseudonym Robert Rich, he wins a screenwriting Oscar for 1955s THE BRAVE ONE; and then both Otto Preminger (Christian Berkel) and Kirk Douglas (Dean Gorman) come to him with screenwriting offers (which led to SPARTACUS and EXODUS getting made), bringing him back to prominence.

Jay Roach, known for, among other things, the 2012 made-for-cable political drama GAME CHANGE, and screenwriter John McNamara show the corrosive effect that the Hollywood blacklist had on the industry, not just Trumbo, but for fellow travelers (portrayed by, among others, Louis C.K., John Getz, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Alan Tuduk), and those who turned in their supposed friends.  The whole atmosphere of paranoia, hysteria, and overcooked anti-Communist hate is masterfully shown with much footage of the HUAC hearings and many other Hollywood stars who got caught up in it all, including Robert Taylor (who is seen to say, If I had my way, theyd all be sent back to Russia).  Elliott, who had been on the CBS military drama JAG in the 1990s, while he doesnt look too much like The Duke, does give a solid, strapping performance, at least in speaking mannerisms, of the rabidly anti-Commie Wayne, while Mirren is deliciously slimy as the equally anti-Commie gossip columnist legend Hopper.

It is, however, Cranstons cutting performance as Hollywoods most famous blacklisted writer that truly stands out.  He so captures much of Trumbos biting mordant wit and sarcasm, both at his enemies and, more painfully, at his family.  His choking and halting speech about the blacklist, where he admits that no heroes or villains came out of it, only a lot of victims, at the Laurel Awards in L.A. in March 1970 is among the most compelling moments of the film, because it clearly depicts Trumbo as having always been a man of deep principles who fought for equality at a time in America where conformity was not only the norm, but it was practically forced on everyone, and when those who didn't were automatically deemed either Commies or fellow travelers.  This is something that the America of the second decade of the 21st century can learn in the age of right-wing autocracies.",1536105600,,4422,4.994557823129251

Beautiful complement to the book as it shows in vivid detail the parts of Trumbo's life which are somewhat hard to understand due to the context of time. Such as his experience in jail in Kentucky. His brief relationship to the African American friend he meets there working as a clerk because he is skilled at writing and typing. And of course, the Black list Trials as well.
