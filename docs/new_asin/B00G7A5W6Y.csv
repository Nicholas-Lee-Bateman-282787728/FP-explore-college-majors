6062198,5,B00G7A5W6Y,"This is a highly entertaining movie that I could watch every day.  Colin Mason is like Bugs Bunny in human form, and the faces he makes are so great, especially when he is drunk or killing someone.  He's just always very cool.  Snide in a very funny way.  It's not really explicitly gory either, the murders all happened very fast, it was more the build-up to them and the way he analyzed them afterwards that made it exciting.",1392076800,2,427,4.435897435897436
6062199,5,B00G7A5W6Y,"It really blurs the line of fact and fiction. I can't help but assume this movie is fiction, but it feels so real and the acting is spot on. The film is so raw and real it keeps you clinging to the end. Really a fantastic movie and I highly recommend it. A great achievement in independent horror/suspense!",1389916800,2,306,4.293103448275862

6062201,1,B00G7A5W6Y,"As a huge fan of found-footage, this has got to be one of the worst, if not the worst, FF film I have ever seen. The lead was beyond incompetent, so much so that he actually ruined the film. His awkward pauses, and uninspired performance just made me laugh out loud, and not in a good way. It was like watching an amateur try to remember his lines. There were some convincing people in this movie, in particular, the rest of the high school cast. But when your lead is that untalented, how can you save the rest of the movie? It had great potential, but honestly, nothing good can be said about the actual finished product. It was just plain terrible. People really need to stop casting family members and friends in their movies, and find people with actual talent instead. It is a shame that the premise was wasted by such a horrible actor. Avoid this like it has Ebola.",1416960000,19,872,4.388888888888889

6062204,1,B00G7A5W6Y,"I can only assume that those people rating this movie above two stars watched a different film then I did. Reading the summary and knowing it was an indipendent film I had high hopes for the movie. I wrongly assumed it would be frighteningly realistic with a decent cast and plenty of realistic gore. This film delivered none of the above. If you like horror movies, thrillers, mocumentaries, or viewing a descent into madness you will not like this movie.",1397779200,10,456,4.7125
6062205,1,B00G7A5W6Y,"This film was so bad i have yet to even finish it; so far two girls are dead and the 10 year old poser who's acting skills are those of maybe a high school play, is video taping every rant he can poorly construct.
Once again the shaky camera is the story teller; the laziest form of film making out. (thanks Blare Witch). So we get to see this 10 year old mug for the camera improvise some of the worst dialogue and kill in the driest way's possible. Would someone please tell kids hand held camera is lazy and not good on any level it worked in ONE film ONE film please people STOP!
This film has no gore and no plot other than he got all his parents friends to look into the camera and say he is so crazy. If u have to tell the audience over and over he is so bad and crazy with out showing anything that leads us to believe he is nothing more then a spoiled brat with to much time on his hands, then there is a problem.",1397260800,12,922,3.935828877005348
6062206,4,B00G7A5W6Y,Very interesting movie although a lot less gory than I expected. (I would recommend this to anyone who likes movies that are a bit out there).,1394064000,2,142,4.5
6062207,5,B00G7A5W6Y,"I loved this movie. Kept me interested and entertained all the way through. It's not all gore, blood and guts like the title art suggests - but it is a nice low budget horror film with a documentary type feel.",1393977600,2,209,4.25
6062208,2,B00G7A5W6Y,"I waited for this film for months and eagerly counted the days until its release; I cannot believe what I saw and how frequently I pushed the forward key.  This film had the pretense to be imaginative and truly entertaining.  Frankly, the most frightening imagery from the move was the DVD cover design.  I do not say this is some attempt at facetiousness, given the hype and spoilers, I imagined the special effects were going to be one of the strong suits of this film. The actors were less than capable and the lead character spent an inordinate amount of time on the screen feigning delirium and some amorphous level of spookiness.  I truly wanted to like this film but each and every kill was a comical cavalcade of gurgling sounds and unrealistic choking scenarios.  (Spoiler alert) We even endured the typical body out of sight and the killer striking it several times only to have the Halloween store blood spurt up in an unnatural direction and without any measure of realism.  It was simply an unrealized level of intensity and for that I have to rate it low on the buy it now list.  This one truly is a disappointment, but I look forward to others from this director as I do plan on a second chance.",1392768000,32,1210,4.522935779816514

8621203,1,B00G7A5W6Y,"This film was recommended from some fellow gore fans, I guess my idea of shockumentry as opposed to other's is obviously not equal. The acting is not good really and I cannot believe anyone could think it was real. I was far more convinced with other movies of this nature. Unimpressed.",1480118400,,286,4.627450980392157
8621204,1,B00G7A5W6Y,"For some reason my original reveiw was hidden by ""sensitive filter""...DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS DRECK...firstly, it is not genuine ""found footage"" as it intimates...secondly, it is a terrible movie...essentially it is a whine fest put on by a zit-faced supposed bad-**s serial killer...who is little more than annoying...save your money and your time...pass on this one...your brain cells will thank you for not sacrificing them...",1479859200,,437,5.4411764705882355

8621206,1,B00G7A5W6Y,"This is simply a terrible, terrible video (I can't bring myself to call it a movie). The acting is insultingly bad (especially the lead actor), and the writer clearly wanted to write a ""that film really got me thinking about ___ "" commentary on modern society, social media, etc etc... Instead, it's just a giant train wreck. Save your money and time - even if you're a die-hard found footage horror fan, like me.

The lead actor's acne makeup, I should note, was yet another ridiculous element of this video. Because it's primarily shot using the lead actor's own home movies, you're subjected to what amounts to a 1 hour Clearasil commercial..

Skip this thing, save your money and time - trust me, it's really that bad. It's one of those videos (especially if you're a found footage horror fan) that you'll kick yourself for renting.",1454803200,3,836,4.719178082191781
8621207,4,B00G7A5W6Y,"For foundfootage I didn't think it was that bad. It kept my interest,yes acting had a lot to be desired,but ..I still i didn't find it boring. Even thought the actor (very young)who played the serial killer wasn't a good actor,I thought the found footage film was interesting. Kinda reminded me of The Poughkeepsie Tapes",1438473600,,320,4.836363636363636

8621210,1,B00G7A5W6Y,"I don't really know if I can put into words just how bad  this movie is. The acting was horrible. While I think the story had potential, it was executed very poorly. I'm simply surprised the filmmakers were proud enough of this film to release this film.",1427241600,6,254,4.404255319148936
8621211,1,B00G7A5W6Y,"Agree with the reviewer that said that the acting by the lead actor was the worst by a lead ever. It's kind of a shame since many of the other actors were competent to pretty good and the story and dialogue have the potential to equal a good movie. Surely, the lead actor financed the film or is a relative to the financier or producer of the film, as every other actor in the film could have at least made the made the film watchable. The lead is so bad at being convincing due to constantly over acting and overreacting with the kind of cliched emotions that one would see in a middle school play that it's hard to tell if he is that bad of an actor or if he is acting like that on purpose in the hopes of making one of those ""it's so bad, it's good"" kind of movies.",1425081600,4,768,4.026143790849673
