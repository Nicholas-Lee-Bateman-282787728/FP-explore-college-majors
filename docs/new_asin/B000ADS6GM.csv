8078037,3,B000ADS6GM,"First I'd like to acknowledge that I borrowed this DVD from my local library. I'm happy about that, because I would not have been satisfied had I paid full price. At ten bucks, I would be a buyer. Maybe.

The content of the video is fine. The instructions are basic - really basic, and if you watch much food TV, you've seen all this before. The production values are on a par with a middle-of-the-road quality YouTube video, and the whole thing looks, well... amateur. The cooks on the video may be professionals, but the people who put this together apparently were not. The recipe booklet was missing from the copy I reviewed, so I can't speak to its content or quality. The recipes in the video are simple, entry level fare.

The bottom line is that this video was sort of interesting to watch, and not a bad effort, but for the same money you can invest in a really good barbecue book, maybe two if you catch them on sale. I would recommend this for folks who learn better from watching rather than reading, or for those who are new to barbecuing.",1345593600,,1052,4.417525773195877
8078038,1,B000ADS6GM,"This video was more a commercial for each of the restaraunts as opposed to a ""Master Guide"".  There were no secrets given and the basics that were given were so basic that I'm sure they were trying to speak to a group of 6th graders - home economics class.  I am so upset with this purchase that when my wife offered to sell it in our next garage sale I told her no for fear of someone else wasting their money on this waste of a video.",1281484800,3,436,4.0
8078039,5,B000ADS6GM,"I've spent many years trying to figure out how to book BBQ.  Low and slow kind, not on a hot grill.  If I would have had this dvd, my learning curve would have been cut dramatically.  If you are already very good, buy it anyway.  Jeff Stehney is the best and his BBQ in Kansas City is the best.  Learn from the best in this dvd.",1258761600,,328,3.909090909090909

8078041,5,B000ADS6GM,"This is a very informative video. I am an experienced hot smoking fanatic and I picked up several tips from the video. It is money well spent, in my opinion. The gentlemen providing instruction in the video all have winning credentials and are passionate in what they do. I took notes and have since applied some of the techniques with very delicious results. It is an excellent addition to ones personal library.",1211414400,2,413,4.75
