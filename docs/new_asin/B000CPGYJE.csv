This is a lecture, but 'Dinosaur George' tells many dinosaur/kid/mom/grandpa jokes and funny stories giving a great deal of interesting dinosaur information.  I plan to use this with my elementary class.",1420934400,,308,4.666666666666667
8099944,5,B000CPGYJE,"I live in San Antonio, Dinosaur George country and I can't even begin to tell you how great he is. Kids love him and his style is simply fun to watch. He has two dvd's out and we bought both as soon as we saw them. He keeps the audience engaged and teaches them a thing or two in the process. This is a great dvd but if you get the chance to see him live it is more than worth the trip.",1166659200,3,386,3.6626506024096384
