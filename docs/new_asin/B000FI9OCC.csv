2566278,5,B000FI9OCC,"Even if you are not an Edward G. Robinson fan, you will appreciate his character and the outstanding troop around him.  The comedy is wise-guy and quick.  Too quick, I believe for audiences when it first came out.  It takes two or 3 viewings to catch the bountiful one-liners and dark humor.  I first saw the movie on WGN 15 years ago, and have been looking for it ever since.  I could not wait to share it with my family when it came out on DVD.  The comedy is drawn from the prohibition period and murder, so I would recommend a pre-movie talk with young viewers to give them some context of the 20s and 30s.  Other than that, it is pretty tame compared to ""G"" and ""PG"" rated stuff out there today.  Have fun with this great old movie.",1170115200,,737,4.214285714285714
2566279,4,B000FI9OCC,I enjoyed this comedic twist on the old-school gangster flick.,1169337600,,62,5.3
2566280,4,B000FI9OCC,"""A Slight Case of Murder"" led me to comparisons with ""Arsenic and Old Lace"".  Maybe it's the bothersome corpses, the underworld characters, the clueless relatives, or the bumbling law enforcement characters but there is definitely a similarity.  Most of all, the similarity is that the movies are quite humorous and very enjoyable.  ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" scores higher in my book due to the quality of the acting, directing and writing but both are well worth the time.  Most people are aquainted with ""Old Lace"" and, if not, it's fairly available .  This was the first oppotunity I had to see ""A Slight Case of Murder"".

The best part of ASCOM is the preformance of Edward G. Robinson; one of the great actors of the 30's and 40's.  He plays a good ""heavy"" yet fits right in with the humor.  The only other name in the cast that I recognized was the wisenheimer sidekick character actor Allen Jenkins.  The plot, written in part by Damon Runyon, has a Prohibition bootlegger go legitimate after booze was legalized again.  When the bootlegger (Robinson) had a monopoly, it didn't matter what his beer tasted like.  Once the professionals got back into the market, no one wanted his brand.  So the money problems mount up, he's in debt, his daughter is going to get married and he has to pay off his loan or lose everything.  The stage is set for a lot of interesting twists and turns.

If ASCOM has a short coming (and this wouldn't have mattered much back in 1937) it's that some of what we are asked to accept is a bit too much.  I'm sure fans of ""CSI"" would have a fit with the outcome.  However, the movie puts us in a mood to relax and enjoy so why bother with such details.  ""A Slight Case of Murder"" is one of those films I like to call a retro-sleeper.",1166313600,3,1762,4.45625
2566281,5,B000FI9OCC,"""A Slight Case of Murder"" represented a welcome change of pace in 1938 for Edward G Robinson whereby he was able to send up his gangster image. Robinson plays Remy Marcos, a bootlegger during prohibition who goes straight with its repeal and into the legitimate brewery business.  The only problem is that his beer tastes lousy and business is bad now that the suckers are not forced to buy his product through strong arm tactics.

The film was written by Damon Runyon, among others, and it reflects this with the slang and wealth of ""small"" characters which fill the film.  The premise of the crook trying to go straight is a brilliant base for the hilarious comedy which follows, including Remy's wife Ruth Donnelly, flicking between highbrow talk and slang as she goes up market and superb support from Allen Jenkins, Ed Brophy and others as thugs who have to toe the line. Even one of the Dead End Kids appears as the child from the Orphanage Remy grew up in and chosen to spend a month in Remy's house. The scene at the orphanage with Margaret Hamilton, ""Ain't changed a bit, as slick as a horse hair couch"" says Remy to her, is as funny as anything in any film of the thirties. Also, the scene when the boys discuss the disposal of 4 dead bodies is side splitting. As the plot progresses, the jokes pile up, one after another, never letting up right to the superb finish.

The DVD print is excellent and there is the usual generous list of extras which Warner Brothers offer on their DVDs.  The documentary commentary is more interesting than the hesitant and repetitive drone of the verbal commentary which can be played with the film. A pity too, because the commentator has some worthwhile observations to make and places the film squarely in its context of the 1938 Warner Brother's production line.

If the DVD is purchased as part of the Warner's Tough Guys Collection of which it is the forgotten gem, it is great value.",1155254400,16,1933,4.604651162790698

2566313,2,B000FI9OCC,"Comic tastes change over the years, and the best way to illustrate the difference between movie humor in the 1930s and that of today is to note that the Three Stooges and Little Rascals were considered hilarious in their time, but not too many adults find them amusing today. ""A Slight Case of Murder"" was an acclaimed and popular gangster comedy when released in 1938, but a lot of the jokes come off today about as flat as the beer made in star Edward G. Robinson's brewery.

Robinson headlines the cast in ""Murder"" playing Remy Marko, a former bootlegger who decides to go legit when Prohibition ends and sell the same beer he made before, but now to do so legally. What he doesn't know (since he's never tasted the beer) is that it's terrible and, now that legitimate breweries are making their own quality beers, no one is drinking Remy's. He soon finds himself deeply in debt with the bank ready to foreclose unless he can get his hands on a bundle of cash within the next day. Remy decides to go to his country house to think of a plan and to throw a party for his daughter and her new fianc, unaware that the guy is a state trooper.

""Murder"" is based on a Broadway play co-written by Damon Runyan, and most of the action takes place at the country house. There, Remy and his old gang (who are now his servants) literally stumble onto several inconvenient dead bodies and a convenient case stuffed with enough money to pay off Remy's debts. Both of these are the result of a robbery earlier that day involving some other gangsters. When Remy does discover the full extent of the mess he's in, he has to do some fast talking to get out of trouble.

""Murder"" has all the ingredients of classic farce or screwball comedy (a 30s brand of humor that does hold up well today), but director Lloyd Bacon abandons all this for most of the movie in favor of crude slapstick and cruder mugging. As written, Remy Marko is pretty much of a clueless idiot for most of the movie, and Robinson plays him that way. The portrayal is spot on as he looks bemusedly content and borderline smug (although he never becomes unlikable). Amazingly, he also comes across as the smartest person in the movie other than the slimy bankers who are waiting for their chance to get their hands on Remy's valuable brewmaking machinery. Remy's hoods seem to have a collective IQ in double digits and spend most of their time with even goofier befuddled expressions on their faces. The rich society sorts at Remy's party act as if they've just discovered they'd stepped in cow manure. And worst of all is a shamelessly mugging wiseguy street urchin Remy wants to adopt (played by Dead End Kid Bobby Jordan).

A lot of the success in comedy depends on timing, and Bacon's pacing is far too slow. The jokes take much too long to deliver, and even some good one-liners seem to fade into the woodwork  because the delivery is off. Robinson almost always played a sharp cookie, and my guess is that the original stage version probably portrayed his character as more of a fast talking manipulator, but here, he seems in a daze for much of the film. I don't think this is bad acting, since he's playing befuddled quite well, but poorly thought out direction. It's only in the last 15 minutes that the comic one-liners have any bite to them.

The physical comedy in the film fares even worse. Moving around dead bodies in a crowded house would seem to be a natural laugh generator (just take a look at ""Weekend at Bernie's""), but, due to Production Code restrictions, the camera couldn't show the dead bodies or them being moved around to any extent, so all we're left with are point-of-view reaction shots from the closet where the bodies are supposed to be when people see them. Instead, for physical comedy, we get young Jordan shooting a fat hood in the rear end with a pea from a slingshot and seeing the guy yell and look around confusedly.

The Warner gangster DVDs usually come with a solid collection of extra features, but these too are a bit of a disappointment. There is a commentary by film critic Robert Sklar, but it often gets bogged down in details such as Sklar listing how many films each supporting actor played in during various years in the 1930s. The only good extra feature is a 20-minute documentary discussing how Prohibition and bootlegging were depicted in films of that era.

For a movie that's a flat out comedy, ""Murder"" rarely made me laugh. I chuckled at about a half dozen of the jokes in the script and not one time at the many attempts at physical humor. Worse, I found the juvenile delinquent played by Jordan to be actively annoying nearly every minute he was on screen, and he's supposed to be a scruffy but likable sort. Edward G. Robinson is always worth watching in a movie, and he's as professional as ever despite the material, but he's the only admittedly slight reason to watch ""A Slight Case of Murder.""",1410998400,,4915,4.552036199095022
2566314,5,B000FI9OCC,"Adapted from a short-running 1935 Broadway play, A SLIGHT CASE OF MURDER (1938) is a terrific crime/comedy amalgam with Eddie Robinson, the amazing Ruth Donnelly, Jane Bryan, Bobby Jordan, Allen Jenkins, Edward Brophy and the usual cast of WARNER stock players.

It's the amusing story of a former bootlegger who for years bottled the worst beer in creation. Now that he's a legitimate but clueless brewer nobody wants Remy Marco's rancid panther pee and he soon goes broke. Nora, Marco's ex-moll wife, aspires to high society but at the most inopportune moments she keeps slipping back into her sharp-edged street persona and accent.

Further problems: Remy's daughter is in love with a too-tall state trooper; there's a bundle of stolen loot in the house plus four dead gangsters. It's a wonderful screwball comedy, done in classic WARNER BROS. style.

Directed by Lloyd Bacon. Currently rated 7.2 at IMDb.

2566333,3,B000FI9OCC,"A Slight Case of Murder has a fine cast, headed by the versatile and almost always impressive Robinson, along with the winsome Jane Bryan as his daughter and a trio of familiar and funny character actors as his dim-witted henchmen. The writers provide countless setups for great gags: sneaking the corpses of rival gangsters into a house during a wild party, ex-racketeer Robinson and wife (Ruth Donnelly) trying to adopt the manners of the upper crust, a cowardly cop who wants to marry into the family, and so on.

But despite all that great potential, this film doesn't offer too many laughs, largely because of Lloyd Bacon's uninspired, unimaginative direction. Comedy is in part about the pleasantly unexpected, but here, too often, you know exactly what's coming down the pipe. The bit about dragging the corpses out and then sneaking them back reminds you of zany films like the hilarious Arsenic and Old Lace and suffers in comparison: the gag could have been built up to a comic crescendo of confusion and close calls but all we get is one surprised reaction on a stairway. Comedy is also about timing, and A Slight Case of Murder too often lacks any real pep, but just cozily ambles along.

Thankfully, director Bacon honed his comic chops to a much keener edge by the time of 1942's Larceny, Inc., another Robinson-led gangster spoof that is better paced and far funnier than this one. (The addition of the great Broderick Crawford and Jack Carson to the mix is also a great boost.)

Both these films are available as part of the Warner Gangsters boxed sets.",1325808000,,1569,4.782287822878229
2566334,4,B000FI9OCC,"People tend to forget that Edward G Robinson was a great actor, and quite capable of playing the gangster (""Little Caesar"", ""Key Largo"") as well as the comic (""The Man with Two Faces"", ""Brother Orchid"", ""Larceny Inc."" ""A Hole in the Head""), and he could also star in dramatic vehicles as well (""Double Indemnity"", ""The Woman in the Window"", Scarlett Street"", ""The Stranger"", ""The Cincinnati Kid"", ""Soylent Green""). No wonder he is listed among the top 25 male movie stars of all time by the AFI.

Here in 1938 we are treated to one of his funniest comedies, ""A Slight Case of Murder"". The film is based on a Damon Runyon (1880-1946) play. Runyon, of course, was the New York playwrite responsible for such hits as ""Little Miss Marker"", ""The Lemon Drop Kid"", and ""Guys and Dolls"".

Robinson had been desperate to break with his gangster persona since the early 30s, but Warner Bros. was reluctant to risk one of the biggest box office stars in a non- gangster role. So in between ""The Last Gangster"" (1937) and ""The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse"" they turned Robinson loose in this comedy, although to play it safe Robinson still plays a gangster, but this time it's for laughs.

Robinson is a riot, playing a former bootlegger trying to go straight. He is ably assisted by Ruth Donnelly (1896-1982) as his wife. Donnelly was a leading comedienne for nearly 3 decades and most will remember her from her roles in ""Mr Deeds Goes to Town"" (1936) and ""Mr Smith Goes to Washington"" (1939).

Look for the Bowery Boys' Bobby Jordan (1923-65) as (what else) a delinquent and the wicked witch Margaret Hamilton (1902-1985) as an orphanage owner.

The film is directed by Lloyd Bacon who directed more than 100 films between 1922 and 1954. He was part of the Warner's production team that cranked out a half dozen films a year, most of them B films. Among his more notable films were ""The Singing Fool"" (1928), ""Knute Rockne All American"" (1940) and ""The Fighting Sullivans"" (1944).

Bacon has the unusual distinction of being the main director for the major Warner Bros. stars (Cagney, Bogart, and Robinson)  in non-gangster films, like ""Brother Orchid"" (1940), ""The Oklahoma Kid"" (1939), ""Devil Dogs of the Air"" (1935), ""Here Comes the Navy"" (1934), ""The Picture Snatcher"" (1933), ""Footlight Parade"" (1933), etc.

1938 was a pretty good year for films. The top grossing films were ""You Can't Take it With You"", ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"", `Boys Town"", ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"", ""Sweethearts"", and ""Marie Antoinette"". The Oscars were to ""You Can't Take it With You"" (Picture, Director), ""Boys Town"" (Actor), and ""Jezebel"" (Actress). Other notable films released that year were ""Algiers"", Cagney and O'Brien in ""Angels with Dirty Faces"", John Garfield's film debut in ""Four Daughters"" and Gable and Tracey in ""Test Pilot"".

The NY Times called it ""just about the funniest show the new year has produced"" and praised Bacon's ""impudently agile direction.""

Directed by Lloyd Bacon

May never be remembered as one lf his best films, but for me it is - full of weird, comic characters, and the extremely well written textbook brings out the very best of one of the greatest screen actors ever - Edward G. Robinson. The film gives you everything you expect from a sophisticated comedy of the Thirties,

A gangster who owns a brewery decides to ""go straight"" and become ""respectable"", along with his unwilling gang and all sorts of funny events surface. His daughter (Jane Bryan) wants to marry a state trooper (Willard Parker) plus bodies show up in his house, and the laughter begins and erupts into hysteria.

Edward G. Robinson is excellent in this hilarious, sometimes surreal gangster spoof from Warners, directed by Lloyd Bacon. Robinson is an ex-bootlegger who goes legit after the repeal of the Prohibition. One of the joys of ""Slight Case of Murder"" is that it is so harmless and never takes itself too seriously. You get the impression that everyone in it seems to be having a great time.

Watch ""A Slight Case of Murder"" to see a great dramatic actor Edward G. in his prime doing comedy of all things----and very successfully!  It is a fun film that you could watch over and over again.

Also, the image quality is terrific, far beter than I expected.  Glorious grey!  The picture came out in 1938, eleven years after the Jazz Singer, perhaps six years after Hollywood really bagan to master incorporating sound into a movie and still have it be a ""movie"" as well as a talkie -- but you'd never know it, innovations were assimilated back then at lightening speed.

2566340,5,B000FI9OCC,"When Prohibition legalized consumption of alcohol, Remy Marcos (played by Edward G. Robinson) owner of Velvet Beer, decides to go straight. Herein lies the fun! He gives a pep talk to his gangster underlings, and sets the tone for the film. The Brewery is going to change its tactics; they are going to quit be strong arms, become salesmen and go legit. This is so funny, given today's sales marketing ploys and media manipulation, excuse me...'spin'.

The second really funny thing happens when Remy Marcos' legit business is going down the tubes. He decides to try his beer, which he quickly finds out...is horrible. He undertakes immediate dramatic action, action which leads to the money he needs to turn his business around.

This decisive action leads to the third and greatest reason to watch this DVD...the actors. Edward G. Robinson is really just great. Ruth Donnelly plays Remy's wife, and brings decades of film appearances to A Slight Case of Murder. She goes back and forth between talking like a gangster's doll and a high class dame and really pulls it off. Child actor, Bobby Jordan plays Douglas Fairbanks Rosenbloom, a cigar smoking, beer chugging, pickpocketing  mug about 13 years of age. This kid has an excellent screen presence. Margaret Hamilton plays Mrs. Cagle whom you may remember as the Wicked Witch of the West! The list goes on.
