8316134,3,B0002WYU1Q,"This Platinum budget disc entry features three largely forgettable 1950's morality tales and one foreign film classic.

Quicksand (1950)
Mickey Rooney stars as a likable mug who falls victim to circumstance and shaky morals under the influence of--what else?--a low woman.

T-Bird Gang (1959)
A murder victim's son helps police nab the titular gang.

High School Caesar (1956)
A drag race goes horribly awry and a virtually parentless high school bully learns he also has no friends.

Two Women (1960)
A heartbreaking tale of a mother and daughter's struggle to survive World War II in Italy. What this Sophia Loren favorite (albeit the dubbed version) is doing on this disc I'll never know.

Worth a buck for sure!",1270857600,2,715,5.02542372881356
