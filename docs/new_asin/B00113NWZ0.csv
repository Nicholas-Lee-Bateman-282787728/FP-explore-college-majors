8240186,5,B00113NWZ0,"While this series may have visual,  historic and , ""scale,"" flaws, it is alluring. With the majestic, oh-so-magnetic, down right sexy Oliver Tobias, and Michael Gotthard, as Kai, faithful and ruggedly handsome friend, this series feeds the imagination-especially that of the ladies. There is little gore and guts, but the jousting, charactrs and setting are enjoyable for the history novice.  I bought the series and the player to play it.  Oliver Tobias is enchanting. You will surely like this '70s show. Here, in 2016, I still love it.",1475971200,,538,5.090909090909091
8240187,5,B00113NWZ0,"Great nostalgic piece. Similar to Crossbow & Robin of Sherwood.
Fun, entertaining romp with low budget sets.
This is only available on non USA region DVD. So, you must have a region free DVD player.
Very pleased with product & service.",1390867200,,235,4.7560975609756095
8240188,5,B00113NWZ0,"Arthur of the Britons is an attempt to portray Arthur as a real king within the context of the time in which he was supposed to have existed. The fifth century was a hard one for Britain. The Romans left and the Saxons chose that time to invade since the British were divided and leaderless without the Roman government. During this pretty much undocumented time lived Arthur. Probably. Nobody really knows for sure since the only sources that mention him were written more than a century later. He was the British (i.e. Welsh) hero who was supposed to return from the grave (the once and future king) to drive out the hated Saxons (i.e. the English). The transition from Welsh war hero to English mythic king is an interesting one which I don't have room to go into here. Suffice to say that usually films and movies follow the English/French tradition, not the Welsh one.

There are exceptions to this of course.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Arthur/dp/B0002YLCG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Arthur</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Legion/dp/B000VKL6ZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Legion</a>&nbsp;both do this, but this was the earliest attempt and it gets a lot right. Arthur of the Britons doesn't feature knights in armor, giant battles, wizards, or any of the other things associated with King Arthur. This is a low key series and is about as realistic as an early '70s BBC programme was capable of being. There are no epic heroes and while Arthur is smarter than his competitors it isn't by another order of magnitude. He has to fight tooth and nail to keep them united and resisting the Saxons.

The real problem with the series is the budget. It was a very low budget series and it really needed a much larger budget to succeed completely. A dozen men makes a battle, and the fighting is utterly unimpressive. The costumes are similarly cheap and phony, although the sets are fairly nice. A sense of scale is utterly lacking. It really is just a few villages resisting a few dozen Saxons. The Romans must have been kicking themselves had they known that it was possible to invade Britain with a dozen men and succeed. The scale shouldn't be as large as Hollywood would have us believe, but armies would have numbered in the hundreds and the kings would have had access to towns numbering in the thousands. It just looks bad.

This is unfortunate because the series is otherwise excellent in almost every way. Oliver Tobias is great as Arthur, a man who is slightly distant from the others but only because he sees the situation for how it really is. Brian Blessed is wonderful as the over-the-top Mark of Cornwall, just like he was wonderful as the same over-the-top character in every film he's ever been in from Blackadder to Flash Gordon. The rest of the cast is fine as well. The plots start off as somewhat generic unite-or-die rhetoric but quickly get better.

This series is impossible to find in the US. I really wish that they would release this set in Region 1, but as it is you're better off ordering it from the UK Site. An abbreviated version of this series is also available as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Arthur-The-Young-Warlord/dp/B0009OUAH0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Arthur: The Young Warlord</a>&nbsp;but you should avoid it. It is abbreviated to the point of incomprehensibility and after watching that it took me years before I was even willing to give this series a try. It was that bad.",1320364800,7,3602,5.270034843205575
8240189,3,B00113NWZ0,"Part of that curious British tradition of half-hour adventure series made largely for children's television, 1972's Arthur of the Britons offers an interesting revisionist spin on the King Arthur myth, with it's young Celtic warlord trying to unite the divided tribes against the Saxon invaders, and is better funded than you might expect (it even boasts an Elmer Bernstein theme tune) but stumbles with some dodgy casting. Oliver Tobias' Arthur doesn't project much presence beyond sulking and tends to stumble over the better lines in the script, while the various tribal leaders are an odd bunch - Norman Bird's nostalgic wannabe Roman and Shouty Shouty Brian Blessed's loud and untrustworthy bullheaded rival - leaving much of the heavy lifting to Michael Gothard's moody and competitive Saxon sidekick, Kai. Indeed, so much so that they might have been better off calling the series Kai of the Saxons. Gothard had a limited range that generally typed him into intense and threatening roles, but he's perfectly cast here and for the most part a lot more interesting than the nominal hero in the first series. By comparison, Jack Watson's father-figure and mentor to both tends to get the short straw at times as the writers take several episodes to work out quite what to do with him.

The first six episodes of series one are generally pretty poor, self-contained simple morality tales that are more a throwback to 50s adventure shows like The Buccaneers or Robin Hood than the kind of adventure series Richard Carpenter would revitalise in the 70s and 80s. The initial uninspired choice and use of visually boring locations doesn't help, nor do the seriously underpopulated battles, but the show does improve as it reaches the halfway point thanks to better stories and more complex characterisation and storytelling as not every situation can be easily solved in time for a warm wrapup, and the film-making and use of locations improves dramatically too as the show finds its feet. Decent guest stars like Clive Revill, Esmond Knight, Peter Firth, Bernard Bresslaw and Mike Pratt help, though others, like Rupert Davies as a bloodthirsty Saxon warlord, aren't exactly well cast.

But it's in the second series that the show really finds its tone. It's not so much that more money has been spent, more that more thought has been put into the stories, while the easy moralising of the first half of the first run gives way to lessons that are left unlearnt and chances that are missed. Arthur takes centre stage and Tobias' performance improves with it as, along with the practicalities of holding together and widening a fragile alliance, cultural differences between the Celts and the Saxon invaders are more pronounced, turning them from stereotypical villains into a people who may be making more of the land than the people they are usurping. Rupert Davies comes into his own too, no longer an unlikely warlord and now a more rounded figure capable of being cunning and deceitful but also of being more pragmatic and even forgiving when circumstances allow, while the female roles generally improve with the introduction of Louis Malle's muse Gila von Weitershausen as a far from submissive romantic interest. While the first season started out as something of a chore, by the time the penultimate episode, The Treaty (the best directed of the series and the only one where no director is credited), comes along, the quality of both the writing and the execution had improved so much that it's a pity there never was a third season. It's by no means a great show (and the image quality of the various episodes on the Network UK PAL DVD set varies wildly), but it does end up a pretty good one.",1293580800,3,3703,4.9326923076923075
