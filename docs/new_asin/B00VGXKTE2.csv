7090176,1,B00VGXKTE2,"This is NOT The Complete 3rd Season! It is only one disc, 10 episodes long. Season 3 was 13 episodes, not 10! This release is missing the last 3 episodes of the series, ""Cops and Bottoms"", ""Campin' Ain't Easy"", and ""Gobal Warning""! They made us wait an extra 6 months from the initial release date for this to finally come out and then they can't even get it right! Fix it so we can complete our collections!",1459814400,10,408,4.311688311688312
7090177,4,B00VGXKTE2,Finally got the complete set after 2 attempts at buying this. The 13 eps on this series is Hilarious! I'm hoping that they see the error of their ways and give them a season 4!,1452902400,2,176,4.057142857142857
7090178,3,B00VGXKTE2,"contact Fox on the back of the case, they corrected the problem, They called me this morning and are replacing my copy with the set with all 13 episodes",1444521600,7,152,4.275862068965517
7090179,5,B00VGXKTE2,"Dont know why I like this series so much.  Its a bit over the top and deffinatley not afraid to offend everyone.  Maybe thats why I like it.  Another purley cartoon this is not for kids in any way.  I think one of the better cartoons adult that was out there the last couple years  and unfortunatley been cancelled allready.  Its hard for these type of programming to find tv space.
I also don't know why its so hard to get on DVD.  All three seasons were hard to find and really only real way to buy this was through amazon and their damn burn on request dvd.  I mean if another seller did this they be banned from amazon.  Im sure amazon paid some kinda of fee but probably wasn't much",1443916800,2,687,4.143939393939394

7090184,1,B00VGXKTE2,"love the series but this is not the complete season.  Missing 3 episodes, which by the way, were the funniest ones!  Happy that they're at least coming back with this in a comic book series, but feel that I got screwed for paying for a complete season when it wasn't",1460419200,7,266,4.3
7090185,5,B00VGXKTE2,"Not 1 star for the show, the show is fantastic. 1 star for putting out an incomplete 'season' DVD.
After all this time, I finally deleted my DVR episodes once my DVD shipped.
Then the DVD shows up, MISSING 3 EPISODES. Pathetic.

EDIT 10/10/2016
I saw that other buyers were now receiving 2 disc sets with the missing last 3 episodes included, so I contacted Amazon and requested to get the disc I was missing. They sent me a new, complete 2 disc 13 episode, set next day at NO CHARGE!

The show and season are great, and now the set is great.
Amazon is quite amazing for making it right, even though I purchased this 6 months ago. 5 stars all around!",1460419200,4,650,4.276422764227642
7090186,1,B00VGXKTE2,"After waiting almost a year, the last 3 episodes are missing!! Somebody owes us disc 2 with those last 3 episodes on it.",1460160000,4,120,4.260869565217392
7090187,5,B00VGXKTE2,"I like this show a lot, although no extras, just the episodes,  they will run you off a copy when you order it. Manufactured on order. Well worth the price I don't regret ordering it. I enjoy this show.",1460160000,,202,4.17948717948718
7090188,1,B00VGXKTE2,Incomplete Season 3. Its missing the last 3 episodes. Waste of $$$$.,1459987200,6,68,4.75
7090189,2,B00VGXKTE2,"As the last reviewer stated, this is just 1 DVD with 10 episodes, and is missing 11-13.  Yes, after an overly lengthy wait for this to be released, it's here...and F_ _KED up.  The box art even says ""includes all 10 hilarious episodes"".  This must be the fault of 20th Century Fox, who by the way are basically selling really nice, professional looking bootlegs (DVD-Rs).  So if you were a fan of this awesome show, just know that your $20 gets you an incomplete season on a single DVD-R. And why is there pirating out there?? Well golly F'ing gee 20th Century Fox...with a superior product like this, one really has to wonder. If you're still a person that buys physical media, in this case, you'd be better off to burn your own discs. If there isn't a fix to this mess up, I guess I will be doing just that to complete my collection. But it just seems a tad ridiculous to have to make it complete on my own after I actually PAID for it!!!  Just my little input about this. And will someone please give these hilarious people a season 4?? Thanks and take care.",1459814400,9,1061,4.338383838383838
