Vanquished by ungrateful witches, ?set up for the kill by Sandra Bullock, and in this one.... well, I don't want to ruin the ending for other Julian McMahon fans searching to find his work anywhere they can. Would have almost been a great movie had they used decent female actresses. He has to be the hottest actor to ever grace the screen. Why doesn't Hollywood see this, and use him in every romantic movie made???",1246665600,,458,4.530120481927711
