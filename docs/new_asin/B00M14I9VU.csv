6546241,5,B00M14I9VU,"I really like this new Met production of Prince Igor. Ildar Abdrazakov does a wonderful Igor. The updated setting and costuming are appreciable, and I love the red poppy field for the Povletsian dance sequence.",1412812800,5,210,5.0285714285714285
6546242,2,B00M14I9VU,"It pains me to give a production featuring Abdrakazov and some other good singers only two stars but whenever I start watching this I am so disappointed by everything else that's going on around them.
This was a very expensive production by the MET, the Poppy Field alone is said to have cost $169,000, heaven knows what they paid for the warehouse full of scrap (Act 3).
Dmitri Tcherniakov, production and set designer, wanted of the production to show the psychological side of Prince Igor, a character that western audiences know little about to begin with, so they went to the original documents and removed everything that was not clearly by Borodin alone, so they could replace it with 45 minutes of less interesting material that made no sense. The overture we are used to hearing is gone. Act 1 and Act 2 have been switched, in the end it has been changed to something that makes little sense. Rather than accepting the love of his subjects on his return home, Igor is dressed and distracted, and just wanders off.

There's more. One of the highlights of the Opera - the long sequence that is set in Khan Kochak's camp - where the exotic setting for the Polovtsian Dances are performed in addition to many important arias now set in the field of artificial poppy flowers, danced by very white dancers in white shifts who pop up out of the flowers. No colorful costumes, the dancers separated by rows of hip-high poppies, so they are seen from the waist up. How thrilling!

It's interesting to note that despite all the attention paid to the ""psychological profile"" aspect of this production, none of that is alluded to in the manuscript, it is all IMPOSED by the Producer, Sergei Tcherniakov, as well as taking the story from the clearly indicated 13th century to modern times n a Soviet-style bunker. That fits the definition of a Euro-trash production. I was not impressed by seeing him in the interview feature, he comes across poorly, and he struck me as one who searched for an opera that had come into Public Domain recently so he could rearrange it and get a copyright.

Of several arias here frequently selected for recitals, Khan Kochak's ""How goes it Prince"" is a favorite, and it's pretty well sung here by Stefan Kocan. It was a favorite of Boris Christoff. Now the last note of the aria as written is below any bass that I know of can manage, including Christoff, so the note before (which is singable) is normally held for that syllable. You can sense that Semishur's vocal chords are vibrating but there's no voice at that frequency. Somehow that seems a metaphor for the whole production.

Who cares what Igor is supposedly thinking? He's depressed and blames himself for most of the two remaining hours here. The opera is about what he's DOING and how he's interacting with the civilization around him - and it can be a fascinating and entertaining show when it's properly produced! Not here.
Also disappointed is that the booklet has the names of the areas in transliterated Russian only and the index numbers for the arias are so small you'd need an overhead projector to see them. Who do they think buys opera Blu-rays? Twenty-year-olds? It wouldn't hurt to pay attention to the consumer for a change.

I had high expectations for this and once I started seeing what was going on I went and pulled a Prince Igor off my shelf, a laser disk of a 1990 Covent Garden production, with Lieferkus, Tomowa-Sintow with Haitink conducting.
What a difference! An appropriately spectacular production from start to finish with excellent singing and costumes and singing to reinforce the characters not leave them hanging like the MET. No body mics were used but you got the sound of the whole stage - the voices were not so prominent but they were still clear and had good presence. With a good player and TV the laser disk and still provide good video and audio presentation.
By staying with the princess for the first act and only going to Igor in the second act the dramatic arc was better preserved. The third act was Igor's hmecoming where he was embraced by his people.
After all the productions that fans have been begging the MET to issue on Blu-ray - they choose to put this one out. Disappointing.",1411516800,19,4223,4.685983827493262
6546243,2,B00M14I9VU,"I can't fault the singers in this abysmal production, but I give zero stars to whoever choreographed and stage designed it. Awful doesn't begin to describe it. Please, call me fuddy-duddy or sneer at my bourgeois tastes, but gimme something to work with here. How about some gorgeous Old Russian backdrops and costuming? And as for that indescribably retch-worthy Polovtsian Dances scene, I am truly regretting that I even watched it. I can't wait to flush that abortion out of my consciousness!

The ONLY reason this review is not one star (Amazon having no option for zero) is I do not wish to insult the cast, who did do a fine job. No complaints there.",1411516800,4,656,4.7043478260869565
6546244,1,B00M14I9VU,"The voices are pretty good here, especially Anita Rachvelishvili's, but the production is a disgrace. Tcherniakov managed to take all life out of this Borodin's masterpiece and reduce it to incoherent junk. Save your money and get one of the old Russian productions instead.",1411344000,15,274,5.25
6546245,2,B00M14I9VU,"Let me clarify something for purists like Dmitri Tcherniakov: there is no ""true"" Prince Igor. The historical record is clear in that respect:  Borodin may have started it, but it took two other composers and a ballet genius to turn it into a viable opera.  Thus, it saw the light as A GROUP PROJECT.  Therefore, eliminating their contributions, or grossly distorting them, amounts to arrogant ignorance: ditto, Dmitri Tcherniakov's production.  The coinceit of setting the opera in a vague ""Red Army"" period only reinforces my opinion of this particular piece being no more than nationalistic propaganda (has anyone noticed how the Met has turned, let's say ""Putinesque"" lately?)  And whoever heard of placing $100.000 worth of silk poppies in the middle of a stage where a rather energetic ballet is supposed to take place?  Movement is sacrified for a static visual shock.  As a result, the Patlovesian dances are choreographed for a bunch of thin wraiths undulating as they pretend to strike sensual poses. This is as far from the original intent of both composer and choreographer as it can get,  The voices are, as usual, fine, but the production sucks.",1411084800,6,1158,5.026178010471204

6546248,5,B00M14I9VU,"Like Prince Igor the character, PRINCE IGOR the opera had long roamed abroad. In the winter of 2014, Borodin's textually troublesome masterpiece returned to the Met for its first performances there since Woodrow Wilson was President. I noted at the time that the opera itself and the production seemed unfocused, but what I had liked, I had loved. In the fullness of time, this IGOR lingers in the memory. It has the power to haunt. It was the first Met assignment for Regietheater provocateur Dmitri Tcherniakov. As usual, his work was filled with bold ideas, not all of which seemed fully assimilated, but it was at all times sensitive and adult, and he struck me as a much better director/producer when making PRINCE IGOR comprehensible to New York than he was when making TRAVIATA incomprehensible to Milan.

This opera is a problem child, like DON CARLOS, like LES CONTES D'HOFFMANN, and closer to home like BORIS GODUNOV. Anyone presenting it must make decisions as to which music will be performed and which will not. Borodin left no performable edition all his own. Tcherniakov and Maestro Gianandrea Noseda opted for an edition free of the interventions of Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov (no overture, no Act III), and their edition places the Polovtsian act directly after the prologue, and changes the order of scenes in the subsequent act (the traditional Act I). This rejiggering in the middle act, with Yaroslavna, Galitsky, and the episode of the abducted maiden, is conspicuous -- even someone coming new to the opera will be able to sense from the words that some liberties have been taken with the order of events. One of Tcherniakov's stated goals was to keep Igor himself more at the forefront of the opera, to keep him from getting lost for long periods as in traditional stagings. So, here, his absence is concentrated in the middle.

I felt acutely, as I had when I heard the Met's BORIS GODUNOV in 2010, that so much of the world's best vocal talent is coming from Slavic regions now, and it is wonderful that in these ensemble operas, one can hear every role filled with distinction. Everyone sang very well. Of the leads, Mikhail Petrenko (the vile Galitsky) most achieved what I might call freedom on the stage. In him, there was abandon, a lack of visible caution. I never felt I was watching Petrenko carefully hitting his marks, but holding back so that you always see the modern person in the costume. He became this lecherous creep from the ground up. I wanted his on-stage sister, Oksana Dyka (Yaroslavna, Igor's long-suffering wife), to be, in her own way, as strong opposite him; I felt their scene called for that, and this would have given it the voltage of a great operatic confrontation, because Tcherniakov's direction was excellent for these two. But throughout the opera, although there were musicianship and feeling in Dyka's work, it was as though I were watching the character from a distance. Everything was there, but muted, glazed. She may just not be a performer of blazing temperament. One does warm to her.

Unlike Dyka, who was making her Met debut, Ildar Abdrazakov has taken the measure of the house in many prior productions. He sang with great beauty of tone and line, suggesting a future Boris, but he too lacks the last degree of imagination that would have gotten this assumption into the stratosphere. It seems churlish when singers such as Dyka and Abdrazakov give so much to ask for more, but this is a demanding opera for everyone. The ""B"" couple, tenor Sergey Semishkur (Vladimir Igorevich, Igor's son) and Met mezzo-in-ascent Anita Rachvelishvili (Konchakovna, the daughter of Igor's rival, who becomes Vladimir's lover) made the most of their chances; they helped to make the Polovtsian act an early highlight. Her sound is more seductive than his, but both are very impassioned. Stefan Kocan is a light-voiced but otherwise blameless Khan, and he too benefits from fine direction -- the interaction with Igor is intelligently worked out and well realized.

There is a surreal, hallucinatory quality to many of the scenes involving Igor, and I liked that I was kept guessing, trying to figure out what was reality, fantasy, displacement. I found the use of projected black-and-white films (covering, for example, the battle and defeat of Igor) effectively cinematic, although I wondered about the practicality. (In some future revival, I suppose there must be a new reel if a different bass? And what if someone gets sick at the last minute? And how much of a pain is it to make the wounds and debris in the black-and-white films perfectly match what is on the singer's face on stage?) The hand-sewn poppy field for the Polovtsian act is already an iconic stage picture. This act also features choreography by Itzik Galili that strikes me as less than apposite. I cannot improve on one of the New York reviewers' likening of it to ""Jazzercise.""

As an experienced Tcherniakov watcher, I found it interesting to compare his work with an opera on the margins of the repertory, from his own country, to what he has done with Italian warhorses. A lot of his usual silliness -- playing deconstructing narrative games, covering the music with extraneous noise such as laughter, sobbing, gunfire, etc., mocking operatic conventions -- was nowhere to be seen. I could even directly compare two similar scenes. When he directed MACBETH in Paris, the scene for Macduff and the Scottish refugees bordered on send-up, with each of the choristers clutching one prized possession, and the tenor performing ""A la paterna mano"" in his murdered kids' toy-filled playpen. Superficially, that scene was similar to the final one of PRINCE IGOR, both in the subject (deprivation, desolation) and in the way the chorus was dressed and blocked. But where the MACBETH scene radiated smugness, the IGOR one was moving and poetic. In paired scenes, Yaroslavna and Igor hold their hands beneath water leaking from a ruptured ceiling, the water catching the light in a way that makes it seem both purifying and chilling, almost tactile. I should not spoil this in detail, but the final moments of rebuilding I found overwhelming, visionary, the kind of finish that elevates an entire production. I did not mind in the least that it had to be scored to interpolated Borodin music from another source.

This was a triumph for the Met Orchestra and Chorus under the direction of Noseda and Donald Palumbo, respectively. I would call it, ultimately, a musically superb presentation with a staging that makes minor missteps but few major ones, and touches greatness a handful of times. Others are more qualified than I to discuss issues related to the performing edition. But those operas earlier mentioned that exist in multiple editions still inspire spirited arguments over what their final shape ""should"" be, so perhaps it is enough that people are trying to wrestle with PRINCE IGOR, to come to grips with it, and to present it in the deluxe conditions a theater such as the Met can manage.

A personal note: When I was leaving the theater after seeing this, a woman asked me, ""What did you think of that?"" I could tell by the way she asked that she was a bit bemused. It is difficult to be put on the spot when still turning something over in your own head, and I must have said something equivocal-to-positive/admiring. Fortunately, we can work through these things on the page, as I have tried to do here. There is so much in this world that cheapens us by the bargain into which we enter with it. We are asked to pay attention to things in popular culture and even in ""high"" culture that are not worth our attention at all. I like to see an investment of my limited patience repaid. I enjoy it when my mind is engaged, my expectations tantalized. Even when not everything works, I will always have time for vision, for wonder. This is the reason to keep going to the theater.",1409616000,15,7915,4.849852071005917
6546249,3,B00M14I9VU,"Prince Igor is a bit of a challenge to perform since there are number of different versions with revisions and completions. It's a shame that Borodin passed so suddenly before completion. This production though, shows that even what remains is a masterpiece.

This production attempted to remain ""Pure,"" leaving only Borodin's actual music and scenes which he had completed (or at least finished the piano/vocal score). Because of this, some scenes are broken, especially in the Polovtsian Fields. The director had an interesting thought in this production, where Prince Igor experiences this scene in and out of consciousness. It's a neat way to go about it, but unfortunately some of it was rather cliche, ironic considering Dmitri Tcherniakov was attempting to be new. This included wafting characters running side to side in the flower field wafting about, but unfortunately I didn't find it convincing. It was a great concept, I think, but the execution of it was not as successful.

Tcherniakov also introduced silent film elements to it. Again, something I am not against. But to me, the best thing that can be said about the images is that they are in focus. Beyond that, there was nothing striking or thought-provoking in any of the silent film segments, with the exception of a camera panning over corpses after the battle. I found the silent films to be incredibly cheaply done, especially the ""implied"" battles - they weren't implied in my opinion, they were clearly shown to instead be splashed with blood and screaming for no reason. I found this confusing considering the budget they had.

The most offensive bit of photography though is from the Metropolitan Opera's director of photography, especially in the scene of the Polovtsian fields. This has been an issue in more than one opera, but this is perhaps the worst case where the cameras continually pan and zoom in an attempt to make it look more exciting - but we watching are actually missing the action. Due to this terrible camera work, you see only about 60% of the Polovtsian dances. All that hard work in the choreography across that stage is lost on us watching this DVD due to the director of photography - and what IS seen is visually striking, and much more successful in Prince Igor's dream sequence. It is a shame that we miss it in this DVD. I really do hope the director of photography will do a better job in the future.

It astounded me that the field of poppies cost over $100,000. I've seen many stage productions where fields of flowers were much more beautiful, and the stage didn't cost more than three figures. This, to me, is something that is fair to criticize for its price. Unlike the press photos, there wasn't even a cloudy sky backdrop against the field - it was plain, straight blue cloth with no further decoration.

Acts 2 and 3 however, in my opinion, were staged wonderfully. There is not enough known of architecture of the time, and Tcherniakov created  a grand hall, though free of decoration, demonstrates a society of power. The strength and humanity of every character is clear in that hall - whether it stands tall, or if it's in ruins. The ruins echo modern sights of war zones, such as using empty trash cans to make fire for heat. Again, in an attempt to be ""new,"" Tcherniakov jumps into more visual cliches as Prince Igor works to repair his broken home: A single light fixture dangling from the ceiling flickers on as a glimmer of hope - this sort of symbolism is beyond droll if attempting to look exciting and new.

Ildar Abdrazakov is the first Prince Igor I've ever heard. I was captivated by him the entire time, both in times of his brute strength, inner conflict, and moments of guilt. No bit of his performance was unconvincing, either vocally or physically. His acting and voice were spot on throughout, and really does give the image of a prince who pursues the romantic idea of war, before realizing what war really does. It is a reflection of a society obsessed with war itself, something I find relevant to this day.

Oksana Dyka plays Yaroslavna. This is the first time I've heard of Dyka. I heard in this performance but also over the radio - I don't know if the Met's microphones are the issue, but I was unconvinced by her, vocally. The Met's ""new"" microphones, though excellent at picking up diction, have serious flaws in recording tone. This is made plainly evident in hearing the difference from radio to the stage. There are plenty of other opera and theater companies who record their performances who have much higher quality sound mixing than this DVD does. Again, I truly don't know if it's because of the Met's sound mixer, or if it's Dyka herself, but her performance did not seem convincing to me.

Even minor character performances though, to me, were spot-on and perfect. I watched this opera knowing almost nothing about it other than the fact it existed, and I loved every bit of the story and the characters. It does make me curious to see different versions, and the arrangements/additions that other composers have added, including the more-standard Rimsky-Korsakov version. I am glad that I got to experience the completed version that only Borodin had written, even if uncompleted.

It's as though the performance itself should be praised, but this recording's quality should be what criticizes it, because in my opinion, the enjoyment is taken away due to surprisingly poor tech direction on an audio and visual level. This is made more offensive by the fact that this production had an astounding budget, but the visuals don't seem to reflect it. Some visuals are certainly striking and even inspiring, especially that hall, but the silent film and that poppy field really did confuse me in appearing so cheap and lazy.

I would not recommend viewing the DVD due to the amount of the performance that is lost due to the incredibly bad camera work, but I would certainly recommend a CD recording in a heartbeat, and I would definitely recommend seeing an in-person performance of this production. I would recommend that the Met either replace their director of photography, or let them know that dancers ought to be given their due camera time due to their astounding choreography.",1409097600,4,6238,4.815126050420168

6546251,3,B00M14I9VU,"Prince Igor is my favorite opera, mostly because it actually has a story that is interesting, not some insipid excuse to go singing.

This production is definitely different than the only other one I'm familiar with (1990 Royal Opera at Covent Garden on Laser Disc). The acts have been rearranged and the ending is quite a bit different. Most of the music is the same, but again, it's out of order, from both my experience and a few issues as to the sequence of events and how we got from one point to another. The poppy field doesn't exactly ring true, particularly as Prince Igor wakens in it after being in a battle (which he lost, badly), although in an extra interview, it is revealed that the entire scene is Igor's hallucination. Really?

One other complaint is that there is a scrim in front of the stage during the entire poppy field act. I know it's there to be a projection screen, and that ""special effect"" works pretty good, but with high definition cameras shooting through it, you might as well be watching analog TV. The scrim rolled up before the introduction, and the scene was recorded with a gorgeous image, as were the other scenes that did not have the scrim in the way of the cameras.

The famous Polovtsian dances have become a modern dance. It's nice, but having the dancers navigate around the poppies takes away some of the spectacle I've come to expect from that piece.

That being said, most of the performances were excellent, with kudos to Oksana Dyka. Lovely in both voice and face, she is quite believable as Princess Yaroslavna.",1423612800,7,1562,4.628158844765343

6546257,3,B00M14I9VU,"Dmitri Tcherniakov, the producer, set himself to create a dramatic opera of Prince Igor.  Borodin never finished the opera, nor was it totally clear what the real dramatic message he intended to deliver, so Mr. Tcherniakovs intent is certainly not misplaced. The questions are did he achieve his goal with this production, and was it worth it.
I would argue that the dramatic effect of the opera is still not the best characteristic of this opera.  The characters don't evolve much between start and finish. In fact, with the exception of Prince Igor it seems all the characters are what they are from the onset.  Prince Igor suffers from extreme depression for most of the opera and his supposed change at the end is so short that it becomes irrelevant.  More traditional productions put the emphasis on the music and the spectacle. What is wrong with just beautiful music and some colorful spectacle and dances?  Do we need to have a deep, somber and dramatic theme to enjoy an opera?  The famous Polovtsian Dances are the most disappointing scenes of all, in fact the dancers looked to me as a bunch of Smiling Zombies.
The effort to make a dramatic opera of Prince Igor succeeded only in part, while I don't believe it is worth the effort.  In addition, I feel somehow offended when a producer makes a time transposition of an epic opera, in this case from the XII century to communist Russia, to make it more real.  I can still relate to human emotions even when they happened many centuries ago
The music aspects of this production are to be commended. Abdrazakov, and Dyka are very good singers and a delight to listen to.  The total ensemble is very good, including the chorus and the orchestra. Musically, this Blue-Ray is worthwhile.
I do recommend it, but only if you have seen a more traditional production first.",1414627200,3,1825,4.713836477987422
6546258,5,B00M14I9VU,"I recall reading Vladimir Nabokov's translation of the epic poem this opera is based on when I was in college. I did not find it paticularly
impressive or memorable. However, Borodin did and his operatic treatment is one of my very favorite operas. The arias are long, luscious and memorable; the choruses are justly famous; the orchestral score is always eloquent and powerful. It is very impressive and memorable. As is this production at the MET. Gone are the medieval trappings and conventional staging. In this production. war is not seen as a glorious mission, despite the setbacks. War is destructive, inconclusive and causes paralyzing fear. After seeing large black and white footage of the shattered Russian soldiers projected on the stage, we see an immense poppy field covering the whole MET stage. Its beauty is intoxicating and the whole of Act II in the enemy camp takes place on it. For over an hour characters and chorus come and go in its layers of flowers. This is a symbolic use of the stage rather than literal, and the effect is liberating for the audience. Eventually, even the stolid Igor is won over and during the famous Polovetsian dances he becomes giddy with joy and awkwardly but sincerely dances with his enemies. Eventually, we return to the more conventional staging at Igor's court, and he returns, a man crushed by defeat and guilt over the suffering has caused. It is a powerful revision of the opera and convincingly staged. I have only superlatives for the cast; all of the voices are glorious, all of them! But I must single out the tenor who sings the role of Igor's son. He is the best Slavic tenor I have ever heard. I replayed his aria in Act II just for the sheer beauty of his singing.",1414627200,9,1730,4.694078947368421

8669589,1,B00M14I9VU,"Well, I've never felt compelled to review an operatic performance before, but here goes.  First of all, compared with the 7 other performances I have of Igor, the singing on this one is distinctly mediocre.  Not that it matters.  This ugly production bears no connection with Borodin's opera and is an insult to all of us who think Borodin knew what he was doing when he wrote it.  But of course there are always those who will admire something if they have paid money to see it.  And anyway, what do I know?  Actually, I am reminded of some opera, can't remember which one, where the chorus sings ""If that's how they treat us, then we must deserve it!"".",1457568000,6,654,4.453781512605042
8669590,5,B00M14I9VU,"I was in the house at the Met when this production was broadcast and recorded, in the front row, almost directly behind Maestro Noseda.  What a conductor!  He puts so much emotion into every phrase.  He was totally into it, was almost dripping with perspiration at the finish.  He was sensitive in the soft parts, dynamic in the loud ones, clearly indicating every entrance to the orchestra, who played wonderfully, as always.  I also liked the production, and felt that it did make sense, although some of the acts were switched from earlier productions.  Singing was uniformly excellent.",1452384000,,589,4.959183673469388
8669591,1,B00M14I9VU,"An excellent cast and orchestral production, the staging is abysmal. Not Euro-trash, but neither is it what Borodin intended. The staging of the Polovtsian Dances captures little of the excitement of the music, and in fact, instead of dancing around a campfire what we see is more hip hopping through the roses. Too much of the rest of the time we are mentally confined to the head of Igor, and it grows tiresome fast. This self-described re-interpretation of the staging and music leaves much to be desired. Get the Kirov or Covent Garden productions.",1433894400,3,552,4.882978723404255
8669592,5,B00M14I9VU,"When I saw this production on PBS I was very impressed .First I found the intermission very powerful which showed Ivan going to war and then appearing in the poppy field, at the same time combining music with black and white images of the battle with wounded soldiers .This scenes can be related to our time.
I was more familiar with the beautiful dances with Igor and Khan Konchak in the poppy field, I would have preferred the slow music danced by females and not males, They were better when dancing the strongest part.
Ivan played an important part in the story as well as his wife who never lost faith staying at his side from the moment he went to war and the possibility that he could die. He returned devastated but she helped him restore the city.
The end of the opera was very dramatic, when all the people, even those who had followed Prince Galitsky who had betrayed Igor, united to bring life and hope back to their city.
I found the acting  of the cast and singing exceptional.
I wasn't familiar with this opera, so I cant compare this one with other productions; the only thing that I can say is that I like this version.",1431820800,2,1136,4.40952380952381
8669593,4,B00M14I9VU,"Indeed, I did like the disc.

It is a wonderful production of what may very well be a not so wonderful opera. The opera is not one frequently produced in New York (see story below) or outside of Russia. It may be that it is culturally specific; it may be that as ""famous"" as it is and as familiar as the music in one scene, it just does not hold together as a story line.

I saw the production at the Metropolitan Opera I think in 2013.

When I told my Mother that I was going to see Prince Igor she said that she had never seen it. Correct, I replied: although my other was then 95 it had not been played in her life time at the Metropolitan Opera.

My guess is that there will not be another production in my lifetime.

The opera was well sung as it is on the disc. The production is striking. It is a worthwhile addition to a collection.

But be cautioned: it is not Mozart or Verdi or the like whose sometimes dated or just implausible stories are held together by such wonderful music that the listener is drawn to them repeatedly.

I saw at the Met. I watched the disc. Prince Igor is not put away for a long while.",1431561600,2,1121,4.091324200913242
8669594,4,B00M14I9VU,Very well played and sung.  The sets and production were mostly distracting.  I can't say I care for the opera.,1431043200,,111,4.5
