6937763,5,B00RZXWUP8,One of the best independent films I have ever seen.  Very good acting by all especially Joyce Hshieh.,1440460800,,101,4.611111111111111
6937764,5,B00RZXWUP8,I saw this movie before it was on DVD and it was great! The premise of the movie is pretty unique and the direction was excellent. I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys light suspense.,1439856000,,186,4.3428571428571425

6937768,5,B00RZXWUP8,Fantastic little thriller! This is what I want it of an indie film,1431648000,,66,4.153846153846154
6937769,5,B00RZXWUP8,"These talented young filmmakers and actors have produced a thought-provoking film about 5 people unexpectedly stranded in a bomb shelter after a possible apocalypse. The characters respond in unique and interesting ways to their enforced togetherness while being isolated from everything around them. The ending has a remarkable twist that will leave you wondering.

This is NOT your everyday post-apocalyptic film. It's not about bombs falling, bioweapons, asteroid impacts or any other disaster. Instead, it's a well-thought-out character study of how people respond to highly stressful situations. At the very least, this film and it's surprising ending, will make you think about what people will--and will not--do in such cataclysmic situations.",1429747200,5,750,5.756756756756757
6937770,4,B00RZXWUP8,"I thought this was actually a pretty good movie. The plot was interesting. Sure, it's low budget, but I thought the actors put a lot into it. Usually, if a movie is terrible (and there are some horrible ones on here!), I turn it off. I watched this all the way through and thought the ending (no spoilers) was appropriate. Nice job to the people who worked on this.",1499558400,,365,4.304347826086956

6937772,5,B00RZXWUP8,"I'm surprised this movie only has a rating of 2.7 stars.  The acting is not badly done.  They are actually really good actors.  And trust me, if the acting is bad, I won't make it further than 10 minutes into a movie.  Yes the timeline jumps around in this film but it's not hard to follow.  If you put your phone down and pay attention to the movie, every jump in sequence actually reveals an answer to something.  I thought this movie accurately portrayed how people would react and break down mentally if they found themselves locked in a bomb shelter with a limited amount of food to survive on.  This movie had me intrigued right up to the end.",1494892800,3,649,4.358333333333333
6937773,4,B00RZXWUP8,"Not the greatest acting, very little story and yet, engrossing and entertaining. Vault-Tec has nothing on these guys.",1494806400,,117,5.555555555555555
6937774,5,B00RZXWUP8,"I found this interesting.  It's an interesting locked room scenario: 5 people end up locked in a fallout shelter on a random day and aren't allowed to leave until a computer decides it is safe outside.  The shelter is supplied with all their basic needs, including water, light, food for 2 years, and a garden kit.  The story is about how these people interact and deal with the boredom and stress of being locked in a bunker together with no external stimulus.  The story gets stranger when you start to learn the secret of the shelter.  And it gets stranger still after you learn the other secrets of the shelter.  The story isn't just a survivor's story, but the story of 5 people who believe they're the last people on Earth and have to create their own society, learn the old world might still exist, they were under constant observation, and they might be accountable to a higher power for their actions.

The movie is a bit hard to watch, because it jumps back and forth between the beginning of the lockdown and later periods after various tragic  events have already occurred.  You're left to put the pieces together until you get to the reveal at the end.  Clues to the passage of time including the computer countdown and changes to the bunker and the survivors as they add art to the walls, cut their hair, die off, etc.  The survivors try to cope with their solitude in various ways, including ritualistic behaviors, made-up daily conversations, repetitive tasks, exercise, yoga, etc.  Later, the survivors cope with the knowledge they are not alone and they may have to answer for what they did to survive.  Later still, we get to see the survivors dealing with survivor's guilt and the knowledge they were never really alone.  Clearly, this is a well-thought story with a lot of aspects that make it worth watching and thinking about.

One of the aspects of the film I enjoyed was the little changes as the survivors painted the walls, reserved their own safe corners, made playing cards out of the shelter manual, constructed whack-shacks out of their bunks, and customized their home over time.  The shelter looked like they really spent that time in there.  In a way, the tedium of their suffering was my tedium as I watched it.  There was nothing very interesting about seeing them deal with the boredom of being captives underground, but I still enjoyed watching the story unfold and the reveals in the end of the movie made it all worth it.  The reveal in the last quarter of the movie was fascinating.  The further reveal at the end was disturbing.
Another thing I liked was the way the camera jumped back and forth between the survivors' interactions and the voyeuristic security camera-style.  You're experiencing the shelter with them some times, then spying on them others.  At one point, you get a great shot of a survivor in an enclosed space from outside, showing a cross-section of the space they're in.  I thought that was a cool shot and worth mentioning.

BTW-there are real studies to see what would happen to a person locked in a space; the effects of total deprivation from human contact, physical stimuli, lack of a day/night cycle, etc.  The results are not pretty.  I've heard 3 days of total sensory deprivation is sufficient to cause brain damage.  The human brain doesn't like sensory deprivation and will begin losing track of time and start hallucinating fairly quickly.  This movie was an interesting exploration of what could happen to people who were locked in a shelter together for an uncertain period of time.  It was also disturbing from the point of view of what happens when people are willing to conduct experiments on others without their consent or knowledge.
I think it's interesting this situation was actually triggered by the survivors closing and locking the door behind themselves when they entered, voluntarily confining themselves.  Going off the final scene, I assume the paper sign triggered the completion of the experiment, and I think it was interesting the various subjects were finally free after the one survivor made their decision to embrace their confinement.  I don't know how far the experiment was intended to go, but survivor guilt played a big part of the events that occurred.  If you've ever learned about the Stanford Prison experiment or the Milgram experiment, it's obvious you can push people to do horrible, inhuman things to each other with very little prodding.

So watch this movie!",1493078400,3,4472,4.81913499344692
6937775,4,B00RZXWUP8,"I liked this movie and I'm not quite sure why, it's kind of bad.

I read some reviews about how it kept jumping back n forth in time, it tells you exactly what time period they're in and as far as the ending....... well you'll just have to watch, it DEFIANTLY  has an ending.",1491091200,,286,4.296296296296297
6937777,3,B00RZXWUP8,It was a good movie but I didn't like the ending.,1491004800,,49,3.5454545454545454
6937778,3,B00RZXWUP8,"Things you won't find in a bomb shelter:
Handcuffs. Endless running water.

Things you won't do in a bomb shelter:
Open a hatch and never look up. Not try the door.  Leave the tap on.  Ever.  Garden without composting.

Overall, I liked the movie.  These little moments of absurdity are easy to get over.  I found myself engaged with the characters. I love how they find their own space in the shelter.  Brilliantly done.  I'm even OK with the out-of-sequence delivery.  I think it actually does cause the viewer to ask questions like ""What happened to ____?"" and pulls you into the story more.  This is why there is no need to character develop any extensive back stories as some think.

So the story unfolds in a non-linear way. predicting the real situation early on but I didn't let that bother me either because the characters are engaging.

My one complaint about the whole movie, and it is a big one, is that the last scene makes no sense to me whatsoever.  We are to believe that guilt is more powerful than freedom.  It is human nature to be free at any cost.  I say no way on that outcome.  This brings the movie down a notch from liked it to just ok.",1491004800,2,1161,4.375586854460094

The premise itself is a bit shaky, but if you can suspend your disbelief in order to make it past the first five minutes, it won't be a terrible chore to finish the rest.

The acting was terrible, though. The only one who did a halfway passable job was Joyce Hshieh. I would totally watch her again in another film.",1484611200,,490,4.384615384615385

It is an interesting and modern take on an old concept.  I recall there was a similar film on the exact same subject made in the 1980's.  There was a family down in the bunker, along with an older gent and his younger wife.  There was some interesting sexual play in that movie.  That film had a deep message too: There is no hiding from the bomb.  What message did this film have?  We all live in our own purgatory?  Is killing easier now than was in the 1980's?

They are forced to remain in a very well equipped and provisioned bomb shelter.  A digital readout informs them that they will have to spend years inside because of the radiation contamination above.  There is no communication possible with any other possible survivors.

Nice premise.  Didn't like the ending.  It was telegraphed by one of the five.  It should have been left uncertain until the very end.

Like others, I was not happy with the out-of-sequence presentation completely unnecessary to maintain tension and suspense.  The basic situation was plenty to keep an audience interested.

The actors all did a good job with what they were given.  They could have used a better script.  One that delved much deeper into their lives before the shelter and the personal discord that would develop in such circumstances.  I found myself disliking all but one of them, but maybe that was because I was feeling trapped right along with them.

6937945,1,B00RZXWUP8,"I kept trying to find a way to give it 0 stars.

Wow, the actors/actresses seemed fine, so I guess it was just the plot that absolutely sucked. Maybe the timeline was jumping around. Like someone dies in one scene and is talking in the next. Really? Aside from the timelines jumping, there seem to have been multiple ways a person DID die in the same movie. Really? Are we time lords? Are these parallel timelines in the multiverse? Is this a 4-D movie? Is this encoded somehow? Was I invited to watch your movie? Are you insane? Are you hallucinating? What is the point you're trying to make here?

The doors are locked by computer and can't be opened, but people can leave whenever they want.

And the ending was insanely stupid. Even if we still had some organization this evil, and the government has had much much worse than this in the past, why would they even want to run this experiment? See&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Killing-Room/dp/B002C6VMKW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Killing Room</a>&nbsp;for a fictitious example of a certain 3 letter agency's type of ""research"".

The worst thing was, I was an hour into the movie (with good acting) before the plot completely fell apart. So the actors were great but the ending was abysmal and the plot sucked. The plot falls apart worse the further in you get. What a let down after seeing the good acting jobs carry the first 2/3 of the movie.

A bunch of the actors don't even have their pictures listed in IMDB for this film, so I don't think they're big fans either. I wonder if they even put this movie on their resume?

One last thing, the movie is annoying by design, but I could accept this for this type of movie. 5 people are stuck in a shelter for an extended period of time, so constant pipes drip are annoying, one guy always bounces a ball, etc. But that's part of the plot, so I could put up with that (OK, maybe drop half a star for the amount of time and volume they play water dripping). It's supposed to show you people falling apart because of proximity.

I wanted to unwind at the end of the day and those reviewers who called this violent suggested it was not for me for bed-time viewing --  others called it boring.  It is in fact DRAMA.  You don't see many movies made nowadays that are this well done -- without the need for special effects or mass slaughter (on screen, anyway).

In fact it is a very well done psychological study of five people living together in a room after an undetermined ""incident"" where alarms went off and they ended up in a fall-out shelter.  They have no idea what has happened outside -- suspecting a nuclear disaster.  Although I like action film --  the lack of special effects didn't make this any less a good ""survivalist"" film.

This is a very realistic depiction of how people might react in such close quarters for extended periods of time --  there is a lot more depth to it (rather than mere activity) than you would expect.

6938004,4,B00RZXWUP8,"I was at a taping of Jeopardy! yesterday and one of the contestants was an actress/writer named Joyce Hshieh, who acquitted herself rather nicely on the show. During the contestant interview, Alex asked her about her acting work and allowed her to mention this movie. She impressed me enough that I came home and looked it up and found it here on Prime.

Kudos to everyone involved in making this project happen. I thought the actors did a passable-to-fine job and each of them had moments that were believable and authentic given the situation in which they were placed. Yes, it was filmed on a minimal budget, but as someone posted earlier, it didn't really have a low-budget feel.

I enjoyed watching the story develop and really appreciated the camera work that hinted at, more than hit you over the head with, what was going on in some of the scenes. There were some weak moments, and sometimes the actors' lines were just that... lines. But there were also moments that I forgot I was watching a movie and I was drawn in to the action and completely absorbed. It certainly drew me in the more I watched it, and by the end of the movie, I was smiling at the how they concluded it. (""We are all just prisoners here of our own device"" as The Eagles said.)

I watched all of the credits and it was obvious that it took a village of friends and family members to make this happen. We should all have such supportive people in our lives.

If you are watching this because you saw Joyce on Jeopardy! and followed her down the rabbit hole to this movie, give it a watch... you won't be sorry you did! I would hope her appearance gives the movie some exposure and gives the writers/directors/actors a boost to their profiles as a result. I would watch them in a follow-up/prequel... they all had some chops and it would be good see them act in something together again!",1443571200,4,1866,4.479411764705882

The director believed it sagacious to throw scenes chopped in various time segments to appear somehow cutting edge, but all that he really did was enable us to pay a bit more attention to an otherwise unwatchable piece of sophomoric drivel.

There are some strange elements that are just kind of ""thrown in""; at least that's how it felt to me and they only served to make the story more confusing. I really think this could've been a better movie if the filmmakers had just let the events occur in the order they were meant to occur and not jumping all over the place in the story.
Besides that, the actors were all good and there were some very intriguing aspects in the story that revolved around the 5 people and their day to day existence.

Oh ... and show parts of the movie out of order to confuse the audience.  When I first noticed the wall art, I assumed it was human excrement and that someone had gone crazy.

I suppose this movie would get some people thinking how they would behave if they grew up after the cold war.  It didn't need to be a bomb, a biological emergency would have worked too - like the Andromeda Strain.

Perhaps people born after the mid-1980s will find this interesting. Older people will have seen similar films and will have pondered the questions posed by this film from cold-war times.

Oh ... and at least 1 deck of cards is included in every bomb shelter that I've ever been inside - plus chess, checkers and 20 other board games. Usually there are 2 or 3 decks. If you play cards with the same deck, all the players will memorize specific cards based on the folds or edges. They also include a few hundred books so people don't go nuts and thousands of pgs of paper with writing devices to let people journal as an outlet.  Today, there would be a low power netbook and a few tablets that could be charged on solar power. Strangely, power didn't seem to be any issue, but they didn't have any control over it.
