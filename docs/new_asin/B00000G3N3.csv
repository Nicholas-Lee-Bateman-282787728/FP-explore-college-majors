7909010,5,B00000G3N3,Daimajin combines Samurai-Sword spinning action with Giant Monster Madness to create a visually arresting Masterpiece of Asian Cinema!  The Green Giant called upon to avenge our heroes is a creepy vengeful spectacle to watch. And the Cinematography is beautiful of the many different landscapes showcased in the Film. Highly recommended and far above the Retro-Godzilla Flicks of the 1960's to the 1970's respectfully.,1356307200,,418,5.634920634920635
7909011,3,B00000G3N3,Return of Daimajin is the third film of the Daimajin trilogy.  Not as good as the first two films but still very entertaining and beautifully photographed.,1332720000,,155,4.961538461538462
7909012,5,B00000G3N3,"Possibly the worst(still worth 5 stars)in the trilogy. I don't remember this film from my ""Creature Feature"" days as a kid but I still got a  nostalgic feeling from it. Majin is once again imprisoned in his  mountain(completely different from the first film but really cool)&  another evil warlord is forcing his people into slavery. Four children cross  the forbidden mountain to ask the god for aid in destroying the warlord  & freeing their fathers from his oppresion. The god sends Majin &  the warlord gets crushed of course. This film,released the same  year,(1966)has even more spectacular FX than ""Daimajin"".The story  moves a little slower at times but it still is a great video. I wish it was  dubbed,I prefer even a bad job(most are,can we ever forget Kenny from  ""Gamera""?)to sub-titles",966470400,2,798,4.9772727272727275
