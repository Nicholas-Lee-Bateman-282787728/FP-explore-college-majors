At least in PagRag (historic virtuoso violinist Paganini realized in this modernized Maksim arrangement) and Franz (Ferenc) Liszt's Totentanz you hear segments of the originals - but with fairly heavy backing tracks apparently added to give extra pizzaz.  At some points, it almost feels like the pianistic version of lipsyncing to a karaoke track.

I was a bit disappointed, at first, because I wanted to hear more virtuosic piano playing from the live performer, rather than the thick texture of the backing track of rhythm and instrumentals.  However, The playlist on the case does indicate that the selections are Variations I and II from his World Premiere performance of September 2005 in Japan.  They are certainly that....variations on the original compositions.

There are also several music videos (Flight of the Bumblebee, Exodus, Olympic Dream (all directed by Sven Harding), and a previously unreleased audio track of Mozart Requiem arrangement by Matt Dunkley.  My use of the DVD will be in a general music class, and it will go over students in that class fairly well I should think.

The similar texture and tempos of selections may begin to wear on a purist who likes the originals... but then again, remember that this is classical crossover, meaning that it is meant to be exactly what it is; a crossover into the pop genre.  If you are a purist, at least consider 'punking' up your long hair musical taste, and try a little Maksim.  You can look him up on Youtube, and I have considered getting another DVD, with some of the Youtube selections just to see if the pop performer video style, and music interpretations show the musicianship I want to see and hear.  Maksim is Croation by birth, and had a great deal of difficulty in that country when he was about 14, due to the warring factions that ultimately destroyed the Olympic complex in which Torvill and Dean made history with a perfect 6 score for Artistic Merit in their interpretation of Ravel's Bolero.  I wonder what Maksim could make out of that tribute to musical crescendo?",1360195200,,2133,4.894444444444445
