I would not recommend for families.",1294444800,8,182,4.71875
4320710,5,B004BW1ZGQ,"These movies are so much fun to watch, even after the holidays are over!  The price just can't be beat!",1294185600,,103,4.15
4320711,5,B004BW1ZGQ,"I own all five of these movies and I love them all, some more than others. I waited a long time for them to come on dvd. I just wish they had come out with this package before I bought them all since I spent three times as much to get them. I watch a lot of Christmas movies and have been replacing a lot of my VHS tapes recorded from TV with dvds as they come out. Home By Christmas is my favorite, followed by Comfort and Joy. And the other three are very enjoyable. None of them are duds, in my opinion. I do agree that they should have captions, as my mother is hard of hearing and it would be helpful, but that doesn't make the movies themselves any less enjoyable. I'm just happy I am able to own them and watch them any time I want. They all have a bit of light romance mixed with humor and that holiday spirt. And they all have happy endings, of course.",1292630400,8,861,3.9826589595375723
4320712,1,B004BW1ZGQ,"I loved all of these movies when shown on TV. However, A & E does not offer closed captioning nor sub-titles on these Christmas delights. That includes not only this edition, but other movies they offer. A poor choice for someone like me, who is hard-of-hearing.",1292112000,7,262,4.717391304347826
4320713,5,B004BW1ZGQ,"Each movie in this package is just great for the holidays or any other time you want to watch them.  Hallmark Christmas movies are my
favorites this time of year. They are warm, realistic, feel good movies, make you grateful for what you have.",1292025600,12,243,4.5227272727272725

8422472,3,B004BW1ZGQ,"This bundle of movies stretches the imagination to consider them ""Christmas"" movies.  I suppose they might qualify as ""Holiday"" material, but, on a scale of 10, I think I'd have to give them a 6.5.  There's better out there.",1325203200,,224,4.717948717948718

8422475,4,B004BW1ZGQ,"This is a good price to have these movies commercial free...sure you can watch them practically anytime during the holiday season (they show them so much!), and if you have a DVR, you can watch them anytime all year long, but that's with commercials.  We wear out the fast forward button on our remote skipping passed all the commercials!  This was worth the price just to be able to watch these movies commercial free.",1295136000,,419,4.648648648648648
