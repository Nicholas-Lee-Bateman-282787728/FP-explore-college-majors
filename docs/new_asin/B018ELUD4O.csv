7545139,1,B018ELUD4O,"Imagine a movie about walking around in a cornfield. Imagine how dull that would be. This film somehow manages to be worse. The acting is amateur and the plot somehow manages to be both incomprehensible and painfully boring. It shouldn't be this hard to follow a film where so little happens. I'm almost impressed. But my biggest complaint is the fake reviews. I guess this was made by a kickstarter or something and I'm guessing the backers didn't want to accept that they spent money on a bomb, so there's a bunch of five star reviews on this. Normally I wouldn't even bother to comment or rate.  I don't like giving bad reviews, even to bad films. The people tried and I respect that enough to not review them if I have nothing nice to say.

Her acting seemed so fake. All the other actors were great.  Don't waste your time on this movie.  There are so many great movies out there to waste almost 2 hours of your life on this movie.,1463961600,,353,4.057971014492754

7545154,3,B018ELUD4O,"Possible Spoilers Ahead.
The cover photo shows corn, the girl, and a knife. I'm thinking it's meant to represent the 3 rows/rose; the rows of corn, the girl name rose, and after someone is stabbed he/she rose again, and was alive later. Is that a spoiler? NO, because there's not really anything to spoil here. In my opinion, it's a 2.5 - 3 star movie, and here's why.

On the positive side, you have a perfectly crafted movie score. I think my biggest pet peeve in life is an intrusive movie score. Seriously, it is perfect, just haunting enough, lightly underlining an emotion but never calling attention to itself. Another plus for me is the acting, which is all very satisfactory, and another is the old-fashioned creep factor of a real set without the computer generated over-the-top effects. I also liked that, as the description explained, it's Grimm Fairy Tale-ish. It has that feel to it, of two young girls going off into the corn field lost forever under the spell of the witch.

On the negative side, what I didn't like, is the story or the way the story unfolds. You never learn what the heck the spell was, all you know is it involves being trapped in the cornfield where it seems time and reality are altered. And, we see Rose getting spelled or ritual'ed but not the friend. So, is the friend spelled too or is her confusion just an imagining inside of Rose's spell? When Rose is captured we see the farm hand guy in there playing like he's scared of the witch, so we can assume he is either in on it, or spelled as well. But we never see the father spelled or going over there. And who was that in the kitchen? And who wrote the letters in the mail? And did the farm hand kill 3 people in the newspaper that hasn't happened yet? And how does this end? Don't worry, I'm not giving away the ending, because I can't! But I will give this much away so don't read on if you don't want to know. - The friend stabs the witch, but we see the witch ""rose"" up again. We see Rose stab the farm hand, but we see him later too. Everyone who is stabbed rises up and is ok later. So it makes sense when the friend says to Rose she has to stab her father to save him, she has to ""do the opposite."" But, Rose can't do it. Yet, we see later the father is fine. Not only is he alive, he is not kicking the woman out. So, having to stab someone to save them turns out to be a lie. But the lie isn't told to Rose, it's told to the audience.

There are long stretches of no plot advancement. Much of the movie really crawls. I understand you're supposed to feel the way the girls do trapped in the corn field, but slow burns like that only work when there's a pay off. Maybe I'm being generous. I like indie horror, I like low budget films that think outside the box, a story that isn't spoon-fed, a good score, and old fashioned creepiness. So this is right up my alley. I don't think it's fair to hold a film like this up to the example of The Omen when rating. You have to rate it for what it is.

Because of the positive things, I stayed with this through the end, and then I watched it an entire second time because I wanted to figure out what happened, since it made no sense. That's why I rated as high as I did. But there is no sense to be made, and that's why I rated as low as I did. I don't need every loose end tied up, but not tying up any loose ends at all? You can't do that to people.

As far as the ""fake"" 5 star reviews and the angry 1 star reviews about the fake 5 star reviews, I'd like to say something. Normally that stuff just doesn't matter to me since I don't decide to watch a movie based on the reviews that don't discuss the actual plot. However... Rows had so many accusations of fake comments, I googled and found the film's kickstarter page where the movie maker asked the early supporters to watch, rate and review in order to get this thing bumped up on Amazon. I guess people answered that request. I don't know if that constitutes ""fake reviews"" though.

Supporting independent film or a friend's project doesn't sound like such an atrocity to me. But if I had to choose, I'd rather have a few beers with people that support indie film and each other, than with  people that write angry reviews about those people. In any case, I won't sit through this movie again. You don't have to fill in all the plot holes, but you can't get away with not filling in any of the holes at all.",1460851200,4,4409,4.198347107438017

7545164,2,B018ELUD4O,"This movie is extremely incoherent.  The plot is repetitive, slow, and the ending doesn't explain anything.  I like supernatural movies, but were it not for the fact that the two main characters are pleasant to look at, I would have given it barely a one-star.

Seems like this would make a much better book than a one hour 20 minute movie.",1458950400,,340,4.540983606557377
7545165,2,B018ELUD4O,"I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting from ROWS. The reviews I had read were pretty much split down the middle, they either loved it or absolutely hated it. Some of us can be pretty passionate about a film but with this one, I found myself being pretty impartial. I didn't hate it, there were several moments I enjoyed, but I most certainly didn't love it, it moved far too slow and it didn't seem like much happened. Writer/director David W. Warfield has spent nearly thirty years in the business and been a part of some pretty high-profile projects. Most notably he co-wrote KILL ME AGAIN with director John Dahl. He's no stranger to the biz and I like to think that ROWS was an experimental film. He tries a few different things, some of it works, some fails, but the effort was there.

Rose (Hannah Schick) is asked to deliver an eviction notice to a weird squatter who is staying in an old farmhouse. Her father Mark (Kenneth Hughes) needs to the property for developing and sends his daughter to do his dirty work. The squatter casts some sort of spell on her and things begin to get really weird. Rose and her friend Greta (Lauren Lakis) find themselves lost within the cornfield behind the house. No matter which way they turn, there's nothing but corn. Moment's begin to repeat themselves and they will have to put together the pieces of the puzzle if they're to find their way out alive.

I'm going to give ROWS credit for trying to be different. It wasn't your run-of-the-mill horror flick and when you watch these indie flicks, it's refreshing to see someone thinking outside the box. That doesn't automatically mean it scores though. The film has a dream-like quality to it, the way it plays out you never know for sure if it's real or not. It keeps you guessing and I liked that. I also enjoyed the performances by the two lead actresses Hannah Schick and Lauren Lakis. I felt the way they portrayed their characters helped to amplify the dream-like quality of the film.

What I didn't like was the fact nothing really happens. The majority of the film, they wander around with cornfield aimlessly nothing really happening to them. Sure, they're lost and all but damn, scare us or something. There wasn't even a single jump-scare in the picture. The repetitive nature of the story quickly grates on your nerves. It serves the purpose of revealing little clues in the story but honestly, it's annoying.
I can't say I liked ROWS but I didn't hate it either. This is a film you should watch at your own risk. **1/2",1458777600,4,2529,4.59070796460177
7545166,2,B018ELUD4O,"Rows is a somewhat fun and clever little indie horror film. The film centers on this woman who is abducted after she delivered an eviction notice to a mysterious person. In addition, she is also put under some kind of spell. She comes to in this world of murder, paranoia and some very odd occurrences. She is now left to try and break this spell and save everyone she loves. The beauty of a film like Rows, you never quite know what is in store from scene to scene. This film has such a edgy at times, slow at others way of unraveling the story, where you are at the edge of your seat trying to figure it out but lose patience at the same time. The hardest part of this review is talking about the direction and plot, I feel anything I say will ruin it for the viewer and is a spoiler. This film knows how to build tension and it does not mind the viewer scratching their head as the film goes on. The issues I did have with this film was the pacing. This film was in desperate need of editing, or someone to watch the finished product and give an honest critique.

The acting in the film was at times over the top, and at others very subdued for the situation happening. I felt the overall film was very underwhelming, it had some very good moments but that does not translate into a feature film. That is like saying,  Iron Man 3 had some ok moments overall. I feel the era of the smart horror fan is upon us. They will like all this talk to death, lack of horror film just for the so-called atmosphere and experience. This film needed someone to step in and say,  we got some ok ideas, but we need to really put more thought into this film. This film has such a dreary and down beat personality to it, the film just seems to be clunky and void of any human experience. In horror or even suspense, however we will classify this film, you need something that you can relate to or someone. This film the characters are so paper thin and just the kind of people you meet in films like this, that it is hard to invest anything into them or relate to any situation she is in. The film has some good ideas going for it, but good ideas does not constitute a film worthy of seeing.",1458691200,,2176,4.163895486935867

She goes to the house and the witch/woman is hospitable and serves her tea and cookies.  She eats them and falls unconscious. Or is she. There's something that goes on in a cornfield when she and her best friend kill the woman.  Or do they?  Or is the best friend killed?  Scenes are repeated over and over.

My advice to you, fellow viewer, if you are bored after the first 20 minutes turn this off and save yourself an hour. If you think it's going somewhere, by all means, keep watching. In my opinion, there are just too many other good films out there to waste time watching this one.

I will say, after watching this entire movie expecting a big ""ta-da,"" magical ending, that this movie does not reflect the reviews it has received.

7545392,2,B018ELUD4O,"When I saw how many people ""reviewed"" this with positive ratings, I figured it might warrant a viewing. However, notice how all of them essentially went up at the same time by people who have never reviewed anything else prior to starting an account today.

So, disregarding the fraudulent reviews that are stemming from friends/people associated with the production, how does Rows fare?

It's not horrible, but it is incredibly slow, monotonous. The storyline and fragmented structure is exactly like the films The Oregonian, The Rambler and the recent Meet Me There (which was pretty terrible). It's cryptic mumblecore that depends more on atmosphere and visuals than on storytelling and cohesion. The acting wanes from serviceable to bad and the narrative just isn't that compelling as it follows the same worn path as movies before it. From the get-go, Rows feels like it flatlines and never truly builds up to anything significant or interesting for that matter. It all amounts to the film equivalent of a shoulder-shrug.

The movie is gorgeously shot and contains at least one wonderfully creepy locale, but the visuals can only do so much when everything else is just so rote.",1451606400,71,1183,5.056410256410256

What was interesting to me were the small, very subtle points during film that make you think about it later, and try to figure out the meaning.
