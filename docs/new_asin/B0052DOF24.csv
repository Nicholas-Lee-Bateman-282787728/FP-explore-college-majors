8453828,5,B0052DOF24,"This is a fantastic yoga DVD in general. I'm a pretty active person but have had issues with sore hips. This workout really helps to improve the hip muscles. I've even used this workout postpartum. It is a little long but I have cut the workout at about half way and it does the trick too. It is a little active for pregnancy however if you are an active person and not nauseous, it really does the trick :-)",1420675200,,408,4.177215189873418
8453829,2,B0052DOF24,"I have been doing yoga and pilates regularly for about 18 months, so I was excited to find a video that offered both types of workouts for expectant moms.  The description is a little vague, and I was hoping for one of each type of workout, but this is actually a combined workout.  My complaints with this workout are:

1.  At almost an hour, it is too long for my taste.
2.  Even though I am not a beginner, I found her cues (or lack thereof) very difficult to follow.
3.  She goes back to the ""downward facing dog"" position a lot, which is not a good thing for an expectant mom who
  is struggling with dizziness.
4.  She does quite a few balancing poses, which are also not a good idea when you are pregnant and dizzy.

A pro with this video is that it does contain two additional mini-workouts that are easier to do.  I have been combining the two of them into a light thirty minute workout, which is good for first thing in the morning.

Overall, I was disappointed with this purchase, and I would not recommend this video.",1313193600,,1029,4.274611398963731
