2806384,5,B000OZ2CUW,"I just want to start off by saying if your trying to get into anime, this is a great start.  I've probably watched this through twice and working on it a third time and its great.

Its a really funny show and this show is absolutely beautiful to watch.  Some of the scenes that are just show casing the surrounding area around Tenchi's house is extremely artistic.  The characters are are drawn very well, Sasami and Ryo-Okhi are by far the cutist.  The voice acting is pretty good, although I've read its not up to par with the Japanese version.

The story isn't as far out in left field as some Japanese anime series.  This series tries to ease you into the story and after for me after the first episode I knew I was going to like it.  The little mini series where they are lost in time and space is excellent.  Just so you know there is a little romance or love in this so in my case, even my wife liked this series.

If your looking for a anime series to get into the genre, this is my recommendation.  If you want a good series to watch this is it, its very light-hearted at first, extremely funny, and then about halfway through the plot it revealed and it gives the series a purpose.",1254787200,2,1191,4.225663716814159
2806385,4,B000OZ2CUW,"Tenchi Muyo is a great show, especially for people who remember it from Toonami growing up. This particular series is a bit more silly and lighthearted when compared to the Tenchi Muyo Ryo-Ohki OVAs, with slight variations in character relationships and voice actors than previous series'. Nevertheless, it's entertaining.",1254182400,,322,5.591836734693878
2806386,5,B000OZ2CUW,"this show brings back so many memories. this is the type of show me and my sisters grew up on. thanks to Cartoon Network, i was able to watch this show when i was growing up. of coarse I was only 6 at the time, this and another anime, ""Gundam Wing"", introduced me to this new genre of animation. I can say that Tenchi was the first anime i had ever seen. this will be fun",1252540800,,371,3.8947368421052633
2806387,3,B000OZ2CUW,"I love this series, but my issue is with the DVD's themselves. Why are there so many? For a 26 episode 20 min. series there are 8 DVD's on a good box set e.g. Family Guy season one there are seven episodes on one DVD and that show is just as long. Other than that the quality is excellent.",1244937600,,289,3.9152542372881354
2806388,5,B000OZ2CUW,"This collection has all 26 episodes for the series intact. It also has character profiles, line art from the series, and the opening an ending themes without the credits in the way in special features. I've been watching it non stop. This item can be bought from the geneon entertainment site for under $50 brand new though.",1214092800,4,324,4.701754385964913
2806389,5,B000OZ2CUW,I first saw this classic anime on its original run on toonami. This is a great anime so 1`m gonna give it five stars. And I love the english voice cast. Its just to bad they were kind of lazy with the special features. They have alot of the same features on the tenchi 2 daughter of darkness dvd.,1210550400,,296,4.033898305084746

2806392,5,B000OZ2CUW,"This collection has all 26 episodes in one box.  No worries about leaving you hanging, its all here.  This comedy series pushes the envelope without breaking it.  All of the regular characters are here, with same voices from the OAV.  A different continuity than the OAV, but enjoyable nonetheless.  I recommend this to all Tenchi fans, especially to fans of Kiyone.",1186531200,9,366,4.934426229508197

8187766,4,B000OZ2CUW,"I first was introduced to the Tenchi gang through the movies and a few of the episodes from this series.  While the movies were actually very good (well, maybe not the ""Daughter of Darkness"" one), the episodes seemed a bit random and disjointed.
But when I got a chance to see the full 26-episode series, it gave me a new perspective.  The story morphs from fun - albeit nonsensical - mayhem in the first third of the series, to a space chase adventure, to a saga concerning a family's quest to regain their rightful place on the throne of the planet Jurai.  The layers of the storyline are peeled back thoughtfully, with each layer taking you more and more into the storyline and decreasing the madcap hijinks.
But that doesn't mean this becomes a droll exercise in epic lore.  In fact, the series becomes most interesting when the storyline begins to accelerate without losing the occasional slapstick moments.  However, the struggle for Tenchi's attention between Ayeka and Ryoko and - just as important - their devotion to him and his well-being, remains the glue that holds this series together.
The result is a great series for those who are fairly new to anime or fans of the action/comedy anime genre. For those who enjoy this kind of anime, I also highly recommend Martian Successor Nadescio, which contains many of the same comedic elements.",1393200000,,1351,4.781115879828326
8187767,5,B000OZ2CUW,item came on time in excellent condition great service hope I can do business with this seller again highly recommended!,1358899200,,120,5.05
8187768,5,B000OZ2CUW,"Tenchi Universe was the first series I ever bought on DVD. I saw the series on TV and decided I had to have it. Tenchi Universe has everything you could hope for in an anime. Great characters, comedy, romance, action and sci-fi adventure. Universe has a much more cohesive story line than the other seasons. Although the whole Tenchi series is good there are lots of holes in the plots. Universe makes more sense. The ending of this series is by far the best as well. You have got to watch Tenchi Universe.",1350172800,,506,4.451612903225806
8187769,5,B000OZ2CUW,"My review will be brief: The reincarnation of the OVA was an utter disaster, and it only strengthened my desire to seek out the Tenchi Universe series once again. Of all the Tenchi series, Universe was the best of the lot. It's the funniest, the most action-packed, and also the most consistent as far as storyline goes.

However, as much as I love this series, it's not worth the inflated prices the amazon sellers set it for. I did some careful price checking for the individual volumes of Tenchi Universe instead. Even though a couple of the 8 volumes were still a bit pricy, I still completed my collection for under $70 (and that's after all the hits on shipping from multiple traders I might add. It came out to roughly $56 before shipping.) So avoid the complete set listed here and piece your collection together as the individual volumes hit reasonable prices.",1329782400,,869,4.6797385620915035
8187770,5,B000OZ2CUW,"The three Tenchi Series that were released on Toonami; Tenchi Muyo (the Original), Tenchi Universe, and Tenchi in Tokyo, were aired in that order.

Of the three, Tenchi Universe was my favorite, Tenchi Muyo being an extremely close second.

What is the issue then when I find my beautiful love and joy is available on Amazon? The same d*** issue it usually is. THE PRICE!

Others' have written excellent reviews for the Anime itself I'm sure, no need to beat the horse but here is the issue, over a hundred dollars is too much to spend for any single series especially when it has been out for years (and years, and years).

So what can one say when faced with this horrid situation...?

BLAST THESE INFERNAL PRICES!",1321142400,,716,4.606299212598425
8187771,5,B000OZ2CUW,"Yes this is one of the greatest canons outta the Tenchi series. Much better more story than the Tokyo series and more cohesive than the OVA episodes. I've seen this Universe series from start to finish and i love it. Although i wish Kiyone was featured in the OVA episodes rather than her debut on the Universe series. But with the price compared to what they want for that expensive deluxe OVA dvd set (which i last saw at about 120.00 US dollars !!!) the Tenchi Universe series is a great place to start if you wanna get into the Tenchi Muyo series.
I also like the fact that the show was split up into section or chapters of episodes. Like the intro episodes and then the Time & Space warp chapters, followed by the Space episodes that Tenchi and the gang go to Jurai to clear there names. Its a well rounded series and I wouldn't miss out on it. A excellent recommendation !!!",1258848000,2,880,4.33939393939394
