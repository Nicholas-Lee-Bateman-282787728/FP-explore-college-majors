6094482,4,B00E9CZF0K,"This is an interesting crime drama. The film opens with three North London criminals in a car. Chris (Kris Johnson) and Tony (Tom Carey) kill Mark (Glen Fox) for reasons unknown. At this point the film divides itself into 8 chapters. Chapter one starts before the killing and leads up to it. It opens with Tom (Ian Pirie) being killed as our threesome search his home looking for...

Chapter two starts before Tom was killed so we now have an idea what they were looking for. At this points the chapters run somewhat chronological, sometimes going back a bit in time so they can work in another plot point and save on film by reshowing the same scene.

I enjoyed the characters and the way the story was oddly structured. However, once the mystery was over and the plot was moving forward, the film went from interesting to run of the mill.

Certainly worth a rental for crime drama fans.

6094483,5,B00E9CZF0K,"This is a very solid and enjoyable film.  While watching it I forgot it was an independent film as it seemed the budget didn't hinder any part of the film.

Great acting, great camera work, and good story.  It is definitely a better than average gangster film that deserves to stand out of the crowd and I believe it will.",1383696000,,322,4.333333333333333
6094484,5,B00E9CZF0K,"I loved it! Who Needs Enemies combines violence, profanity, revenge and comedy with the thought provoking premise of what a criminal would do when a ""friend"" crosses his moral line. The way in which the story is told along with the great imagery makes this a movie to own. It can be watched over and over, each time grasping a little more about the characters and story. I have watched it twice already and I just got it.",1383004800,,421,4.410256410256411

6094490,3,B00E9CZF0K,"Who Needs Enemies is a cool movie to watch as far as how the director told the story in chapters starting from the end and delving back.  You'd think it would be confusing but this is a well paced movie.  I also enjoyed some of the character rethorics.  Great development on each of the characters.

I was entertained on a boring night so I am being generous with the rating here.  This is definitely a 2-star movie.  It is clever and fun.",1446163200,,439,4.2926829268292686

6094492,4,B00E9CZF0K,"I get the one-star vulgar review, it has a significant amount of violence.  I ran across this movie while dredging the slim selection in Amazon Prime videos.  Certainly a familiar story in the gangster way and the characters weren't particularly unique, but I like how the story and characters developed and enjoyed the slight deviation to a shoot out ending.  Acting was also fairly decent overall.

Perhaps because it was Amazon Prime my expectations were low, but I enjoyed it.",1445126400,,480,4.9625

6094494,1,B00E9CZF0K,"To say I hated it is maybe a little overstated, but one star is my way to try and balance out the raving reviews.

This is not a particularly cleverly written film, it is simply one in the now well forgotten genre of 1930's to 1950's crime dramas where a sackful of red herrings substituted for intelligent story telling.

Nothing we see is new in this shake and bake movie: the story has been assembled from well-worn set pieces, and once it is over you know exactly from where they came.

None of the leads is likable, and each and every character a cliche, down to the fat eastern European woman flicking cigarette ash into her filthy stew.",1443139200,2,643,4.432203389830509

The story, the way it was told and in my opinion flawless performances from all involved caught my attention right from the start and kept me invested and very interested all the way to the very end. Kept me captivated through it's entirety without a dull or boring moment. Bravo!",1479513600,2,390,4.666666666666667
