8082135,5,B000B66GV0,"Finally a smart urban film that doesn't speak down to its audience.  It's also the first film to take on the notorious cops targeting the hip hop music community.

Corey Grant, the writer/director is someone to watch in the future.  Buy this movie.

I hope this sells well enough to warrant a Hip Hop Task Force 2, which is bound to focus on another detective infiltrating the rap business to find out who shot an up and coming rapper in the face, as that will be too good to pass up.",1130803200,,484,4.285714285714286
8082136,5,B000B66GV0,"THIS FILM WAS FANTASTIC!! I absolutely loved it! The acting is superb, it was written very well, and just when you then things are supposed to go one way they don't. I heard rumors that this film had a very small budget and that a school's equipment was used to make this. If this is true then they get an extra gold star from me. As a film student myself, I KNOW that school's don't have the greatest equipment combined with creating this on a tiny budget is MAJOR!! Overall, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!",1130803200,,501,4.340425531914893
