1802855,5,B000079DND,"I have been waiting for this dvd set for a long time.  This is one of my all time favorite ""britcoms"" (another being the delightful ""Are You Being Served?)  This 4 disc box set contains all the episodes from the first two seasons of ""Keeping Up Appearances"" plus some special episodes, such as the Christmas episode, that haven't been released in the United States.  One of my favorite episodes ""Three piece Suite"" is included---as Hyacinth obsesses over the royal crest on the van bringing her new three piece suite and her desire for her neighbors to see her important new delivery.  All of these episodes, however, are brillant.  All the wonderful characters are there---Hyacinth's long suffering husband, Richard;  Emmet and Elizabeth, her neighbors; Onslow, Daisy, and Rose---her brother-in-law and sisters and many more.  If you haven't watched this comedy about a British housewife who brings social snobbery to a whole new level, then do yourself a favor and buy this dvd set.  You'll laugh till you cry!!!!  I hope they release the later seasons as well!",1055116800,53,1063,4.994318181818182
1802856,5,B000079DND,Keeping up appearances is absolutely fantastic.  We bought this 4 dvd set and watched all 20 episodes in less than a week.  Now I want more.  I hope BBC releases the other seasons as soon as possible.,1051056000,4,200,4.351351351351352
1802857,5,B000079DND,"Our family has fallen in love with Hiacinth.  We schedule our Saturday nights around the program on PBS.  Now, thanks to this fine box set, we can watch Poor Richard and his crazy in-laws anytime we want!
The series is brilliantly written and acted.  One cannot think of other players in these roles.  Oddly enough, both actresses who play the tart Rose are so good that one almost doesn't notice the change!
The DVDs are very well mastered.  My only complaint about the set would be the lack of any brochure or written material.
One is struck by how mature the series debuts: the first season lacks any of the ""baby steps"" so typical of a series start: every character of complete fresh out of the gate (although Emmet, Elizabeth's brother doesn't make an appearance until season two).  The writing and directing are very snappy.
Disc four has ""The Kitty Monologues"", some work Routlidge did before Hiacinth - one gets the impression that The Bucket Woman is loosely based on these.
After years of watching this masterful series (one of the best British Comedies ever produced), I come away thinking that Onslo is the only one playing with a full deck.
What do you think?",1048896000,10,1172,4.692682926829268
1802858,5,B000079DND,"This collection includes some of the funniest episodes that Roy Clarke filmed for Keeping Up Appearances.  The holiday extras are especially good.  My stepmother actually relates and sympathizes with Hyacinth - amazing!
I was a bit disappointed that this collection did not contain the episode where Hyacinth and Richard go yachting in a lake or the episode where Hyacinth plans a picnic with friends and takes everything but the kitchen sink.  Still looking forward to the time when BBC will release all seasons.
Overall, excellent quality images and sound.  Well worth the price",1048204800,5,580,5.204301075268817
1802859,5,B000079DND,"""Keeping Up Appearances"" was a 44-episode, British TV sitcom that ran for five seasons between 1990 and 1995, with several specials filmed through 1997.  The show's primary character was Hyancinth Bucket (Patricia Routledge), who always pronounced her last name as 'Bouquet' to make it sound as impressive as possible.  She was obsessed with making her family appear as affluent and upper-class as possible, which involves keeping her home as immaculate as possible and telling everyone about any new aquisition.  Her husband, Richard Bucket (Clive Swift), does not share Hyacinth's obsession, but he accomodates her as best as he can.  Unfortuneately for Hyacinth, her various plans to improve their station in life are often sidetracked by issues with her less affluent sisters or her senile father.  Most people that know Hyacinth are intimidated by her, especially her next-door neighbors Elizabeth Hawksworth Warden (Josephine Tewson) and her brother Emmet Hawksworth (David Griffin).  The local church vicar, Michael (Jeremy Gittins), and his wife (played by Marion Barron) also try to avoid Hyacinth as much as possible.
Hyacinth's three sisters live to varying degrees of affluence.  Daisy (Judy Cornwell) and her blue-collar husband Onslow (Geoffrey Hughes) live in a rowhouse in dire need of repair, with a wrecked car parked out front and an unkept interior.  Hyancinth's unmarried sister Rose (played by Shirley Stelfox in 1990 and Mary Millar between 1991 and 1995) enjoys spending time with many men to the chagrin of Hyancinth.  Hyancinth's only affluent sister, Violet, is never seen, but Hyacinth often speaks with her on the telephone.  Their senile father (George Webb) lives with Daisy and Onslow.
This 4-DVD set includes all six episodes from the first season (disk #1), all 10 episodes from the second season (disks #2 and #3) and four holiday specials filmed over the course of the series (disk #4).  Each disk also includes various bonus materials, such as cast bios and other sketches.
""Keeping Up Appearances"" is not as well known in the U.S. as ""Absolutely Fabulous"", nor is it as outrageous; but it is a very good example of British comedy.  Overall, I rank this 4-DVD set with a rating of 5 out of 5 stars.",1047945600,23,2235,5.143646408839779

1802922,4,B000079DND,The series is entertaining but sometimes it is too exaggerated.  I feel uncomfortable with how the main character treats her husband who puts up with all her insults.

Her suffering husband and her sisters play off the storyline beautifully. The three sisters, one married for money, one the town tramp, the other married to a lazy man in the wrong side of town, and her crazy Daddy. And then there are the neighbors who are terrified of offers of ""coffee"". Or the ever scary ""candlelight dinners. All the actors are well chosen, and you will love laughing along.

She gets herself into predictaments of all kinds that lend her no way to show others around her that she is of high graces and elite social standing, whatever these may be!

Nothing goes right for her when she tries to make everyone think she is from the ""cream of the crop"".  She is terribly ashamed of her family and tries to hide any connection she has to them.

For a while, I was only watching PBS and they showed this all the time. That was when I wasn't working, so now I watch the DVDs when I get home from the Valero station. Anyway, this show is top humor. You've got the social climber Hyacinth and then her low-class family constantly butting heads. There's nothing better than opposing classes when it comes to comedy. Some of the jokes are the same, like Hyacinth telling everyone to say her last name ""Bouquet"" instead of ""Bucket."" But the repeated gags are what make you feel at home when you watch this show.

This is one of their favorite shows, and to be able to watch them one after the other with no commercials is really a treat. Hyacinth is our favorite character. She definitely tries to seperate herself from the ""low-life"" characters in her family. Her comments and facial expressions keep us cracking up! I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys British humor. This is a classic!",1168300800,,479,4.647058823529412
1803017,4,B000079DND,"One of the more popular, relatively recent Britcoms, we are treated to the cartoonish antics of dizzily optimistic central character Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced Boo-Kay!), played very effectively by Patricia Routledge. Her liberally dispensed, over-the-top brand of caste snobbery, which forms the focal point of her ""problem,"" dependably boomerangs every single time. This is accentuated by the grating nasality of her voice: think Dan Ackroyd's Saturday Night Live parody of Julia Child, amplified to the same general effect that fluorescent hues have on a bad hangover. Her calm, patient but unfortunate husband, Richard (""Rich-errrd!""), usually must bear the brunt of the ensuing misery. Part of the fun is seeing just how far he can be pushed - but he somehow manages to keep from exploding.

On top of it, her cockney, trashy but warm-hearted and good-natured relatives are the only ones seemingly sane enough to savor the amusement of it all. And one enduring mystery remains: her invisible sister is never revealed, but one can imagine her warts (assuming that she really does exist), given the context of being raised in Hyacinth's bombastic shadow. And Hyacinth never ever learns; her overbearing nature completely blinds her to the discomfort that she induces in others, which makes everything all the more fun.

For what it is, Keeping Up Appearances carves out its own niche. Sadly, minus one star because the edge sharpening apparently added in producing the video for the DVD rankles, and so I sometimes find myself switching from the DVD to softer VHS tapes of PBS broadcasts of the same episodes when I need to soothe my eyes.",1132963200,2,1643,5.149812734082397

1803032,5,B000079DND,"I love this show so much that I purchased the entire series on DVD.  You can now purchase KEEPING UP APPEARANCES: THE FULL BOUQUET, a set of 8 DVDs which feature most of the 44 episodes, all produced between 1990-1995, and including 2 hour-long specials.

This is a CLASSIC in the style of ""I Love Lucy,"" except that it happens to be set somewhere is suburban England. There's precious little here of what one might call ""British humor.""  Rather, the series revolves around the central character's ambition and desire to rise above her ""station"" in life...or to appear to do that. Universally, we can all relate to that.  Just like Lucy always tried to get in Ricky's show, here Hyacinth tries to get close to---and especially to be SEEN near or next to---""important"" business people or members of the aristocracy, to make herself appear important and special.

Most of the time things don't work out as she plans, and Hyacinth is frequently embarassed by her working class relatives [brilliantly played by Geoffrey Hughes, Judy Cornwell and Mary Millar], who regularly, usually accidentally,  show up where she doesn't want them.  [I say ""working class,"" though none seems to actually work for a living.]  Hyacinth's father, who is senile, horny, but harmless, also lives with the relatives, and his misadventures often figure into the storyline, and are further cause for embarrassment for Hyacinth.  Clive Swift effectively plays Hyacinth's long-suffering husband [up for sainthood?], and Josephine Tewson is wonderful as the patient, kindly, and sometimes unsteady-with-fine-china next-door neighbor.

To the people who know her, even casually, Hyacinth is a terror or extreme bore/boor, and someone to be avoided, at all costs. There are many scenes throughout the various episodes where you see people scrambling as Hyacinth is heard approaching.  Hyacinth's speech is somewhat of a trademark; it often approaches operatic proportions, and is sometimes quite purposefully affected and always unmistakeable.

The series is very well written and performed. Great ensemble cast led by the inimitable Patricia Routledge.

Ms. Routledge is an excellent physical comedian, also, which adds to the hilarity.  In one episode, for example, as Hyacinth's patient and dutiful next-door neighbor, Elizabeth, is driving her to see her aging and senile father, who lives with her lower-class sister and brother-in-law in a ghetto-ized neighborhood [full of ""council"" houses""], Hyacinth goes to extreme lengths to prevent Elizabeth from seeing where her relatives live.  She has Elizabeth stop in front of a beautiful home in an unpscale area, then, pretending that it is her relatives' house, proceeds to climb over the back garden wall, after which she walks a few more blocks to her sister's house. This whole scenario, back and forth to Elizabeth's car is side-splittingly funny.

There is even a KEEPING UP APPEARANCES episode where Hyacinth has her own VITAMEATAVEGAMIN moment: try saying ""the dowager Lady Ursula's homemade gooseberry wine"" after you have over-indulged in same, while being quite inexperienced at drinking alcohol.  Laugh-out-loud hilarious!

MS. ROUTLEDGE HERE HAS CREATED ONE OF THE GREATEST CHARACTERS IN ALL OF TELEVISION COMEDY!

Truly, if you've never witnessed Hyacinth Bucket and company, you are missing out on some great comedy! Treat yourself, and catch it on your PBS station.  Afterwards, you just may want to own some of these episodes, or even the whole series.

Now, a note on to the technical merits of the DVDs:
good job on the audio and video transfers, and the extras are a treat.  I especially enjoy the bloopers.

1803035,5,B000079DND,"I enjoy the DVD set even with its shortcomings. And of course we all can suggest ways to make it ""better"" for the consumer. However, take what you can get and enjoy it! Maybe we can write our thoughts to BBC. The episodes are fantastic and commands any fan of British Comedy to just watch them over and over again and share them with their friends. We all know at least one person who is a perfect Haycinth, or maybe a devoted Richard or maybe a neighbor like Elizabeth. My point is the TV series (KUA) not only draws laughter, but makes you think about the people around you. So, I am glad to see I can complete the collection. Only one suggestion, subtitles would be helpful. And though I do not need them personally, I teach Conversational English and Western Culture in China at a Uni (university) and having subtitles helps a lot. So I get to share a wonderful TV show with my students even though they might not understand all the words that are being said. Thank god for fanastic comedy that trascends dialogue.  Last thought, are we buying the DVD box sets for the ""extras"" or for the show we all have come to laugh at and laugh with? The extras are just that, extras.
I would also like to add a quote about British TV said by Dan Bogucki, video buyer for the Borders Books and Music chain, ""This isn't your lowest-common-denominator TV fodder, like so much American TV is. It's smartly done, and it hold up very well to repeat viewing, which is why people want to own it."" And now with the other seasons available...(KUA) is definitely something to own.",1080604800,5,1562,4.442508710801394
1803036,5,B000079DND,"Patricia Routledge is a comic genius. Her portrayal of Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced 'Bouquet', of course) makes for the single best characterization to come out of a British comedy in the last decade. The series is impeccably written and acted with Hyacinth stealing the scene whenever she is in frame. The other characters are similarly well developed, from longsuffering husband Richard (Clive Swift), to her sisters Daisy (and her husband Onslow, portrayed to perfection by Geoffrey Hughes as an unemployed, lazy slacker who reads things like 'Principles of Particle Physics' in bed), and the always randy Rose (as well as the rarely seen third sister, Violet, the one with a Mercedes, a sauna, and room for a pony), to the neighbors Elizabeth and Emmet (""She'll sing at me!"") and even the recurring bit players such as the postman the vicar and his wife. Altogether the ensemble cast supports Hyacinth so perfectly that the show has unrivalled chemistry and timing.
The four disk set contains the famous and hilarious ""QE2"" episodes, and the ""Three Piece Suite"" episode, which for absolute hilarity is impossible to top (watching Hyacinth with the traffic cones and the 'Imminent Delivery' sign is sublime.) Also on the disks are several extras, of which my favorites are the outtakes: seeing Hyacinth break character and actually laugh at the funny situations is a delight indeed.
For anyone who likes British comedies, or likes subtle, yet highbrow, humor in equal measure, this set is an absolute treasure trove and is not to be missed. Highly recommended.",1080259200,27,1562,5.129411764705883

I love this series, and I hope BBC will release the remaining episodes.  I find it interesting that the four sisters all have floral names: Hyacinthe, Rose, Daisy and Violet. It's difficult to understand how Richard keeps his sanity as he has no chance to make any decisions of his own, even though Hyacinth keeps telling anyone within earshot that he's a manager with a very large and important firm.  Onslow's car isn't the only thing that backfires in these episodes.  Hyacinth's schemes backfire as well, making funny situations even funnier.
I would personally rather go for a pint at the pub with Onslow than attend one of Hyacinth's candle-light suppers.

This set is comprised of twenty full episodes, as well as the side-splittingly funny QEII holiday episodes. Even though I've watched these programs dozens of times each, I never weary of them. This is quality acting and writing of the highest order.
Patricia Routledge as ""that Bucket woman"" is arguably the second-greatest TV comedic actress of all time (I supposed Lucille Ball would have to get a nod for first place). Certainly she is the greatest British actress in a comedy series. Her timing, expressions and mannerisms are simply superb. Her interplay with Richard, played divinely by Clive Swift, is always absolutely hilarious. How many times will you say, ""poor Richard!"" while watching Hyancinth's ridiculous social-climbing antics? And my favorite character of all, the fat, sloppy guy with a heart, Onslow, played to perfection by Geoffrey Hughes. Don't you just love how he always says ""Oh... nice!"" with that delicious sarcastic edge?
They're all here: beautiful, dipsy Rose, the sex-addicted Daddy, the McCartney-esque Pastor and his cute-as-a-button wife and the cringing neighbors. It's impossible not to fall in love with the entire ensemble cast. This is television without equal and the quality on this DVD is exceptional. My only small criticism is that the bloopers section is very brief, only a few minutes. Also, Patricia Routledge's solo comedy routines are similarly short in duration.
