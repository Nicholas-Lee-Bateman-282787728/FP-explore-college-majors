8328039,5,B001NXBZSE,Love this author and all his books. They offer an insiders and personal view of traditional gypsy life like no other book I have come across.,1419811200,,141,4.461538461538462
8328040,3,B001NXBZSE,"When I ordered this I had thought I was ordering a book of photos so was somewhat disappointed when a DVD arrived. It is very short- 13 minutes but what really disappointed me was that it was biographical mainly of Jan Yoors and had very little to do with the Gypsies. Having read his books which I thoroughly enjoyed I was looking to see more pictures of him and of the Gypsies but they were very limited and it was mainly about his life in NYC, his art work and narrated by his wife. I don't really recommend it unless you are interested in his art work.",1296604800,3,556,4.205607476635514
