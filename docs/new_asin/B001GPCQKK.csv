SYNOPSES--

DRACULA - UNIVERSAL's first great sound era monster film is still my favorite frighter. A lack of background score adds to Tod Browning's adaptation of the late 1920s gothic stageplay that Lugosi starred in. The only flaw here is a missing finale, what we assume is a fire that destroys Nosferatu and his three wives in their rough-hewn coffins. Frye is outstanding as Drac's bug-eating synocphant.

FRANKENSTEIN - Director James Whale's eerie picture features a semi-sympathetic monster with a fire phobia who ends up burning in a windmill conflagration. Frye as Fritz takes it down a notch from DRACULA but still overacts.

3618790,5,B001GPCQKK,"Bram Stoker's vampire novel has been remade dozens of times, but perhaps the best adaptation is the classic Bela Lugosi version. Fairly faithful to the novel and dripping with gothic atmosphere, what really makes ""Dracula"" stand out is the bone-chillingly charming performance by Lugosi -- one of the best Draculas ever put on film.

A solicitor, Renfield (Dwight Frye), is travelling to Count Dracula's castle for a real estate deal, despite the locals freaking out and crossing themselves whenever Dracula's mentioned. He soon finds out why -- the charming Count (Lugosi) is a vampire, who enslaves a maddened Renfield to his will. Soon after, a ship with a dead crew (and Renfield and Dracula in the hold) arrives in England.

Soon Dracula has moved into his new home, Carfax Abbey, and is insinuating himself with the Seward family -- and especially with pretty Lucy Westenra, who dies of blood loss and is reborn as a vampire. Only the intervention of the mysterious Dr. Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) can stop Dracula's attacks in London, and the young people who have attracted his interest.

Then there's the Spanish-language one, which is virtually identical and was filmed on the exact same sets, during the hours when the English-language one was not being shot. Same settings, same marks, same cinematography, many of the same scenes -- although it's much longer. It's excellent, and although it lacks that iconic intensity that Lugosi brought the English-language film, it's full of atmosphere and good acting.

Technically ""Dracula"" wasn't the first adaptation of ""Dracula"" -- that honor belongs to ""Nosferatu"" -- but it was the first to actually tackle the storyline in Stoker's book, with a few changes and tweaks here and there. And to date, it's one of the few adaptations to portray everyone's favorite vampire with the necessary atmosphere -- ominous, dignified, charming, and creepy, and undoubtedly evil.

Tod Browning sets it in all the necssary places -- crumbling castles, savage mountainous villages, foggy London streets, and sumptuous Victorian drawing rooms with eerie noises from outside. Granted, a fair amount of stuff is changed -- Jonathan Harker is partially replaced by the mad Renfield, presumably to cut down on time -- but none of these really detract from the storyline.

And Browning pours the creepiness on thickly, such as Dracula's seduction of young women, which keeps up the whole idea of vampiric sexuality. But Browning also knows how to pour on the subtle horror, without blood or violence -- like any scene with Renfield.

The script is just as great as the direction, with some unspeakably good dialogue (""For one who has not lived even a single lifetime, you're a wise man, Van Helsing""), usually from Dracula. The bad guys always get the good lines. But the best scenes and dialogue are made up of highlights from the novel (such as Dracula saying dreamily, ""Listen to them, the children of the night. What music they make!""), and it gives a subtle poetry to the movie.

But the star of all this is Lugosi himself, one of the two quintessential vampire actors (the other being Christopher Lee). While he doesn't resemble the book's Dracula (he's short and round-faced), his hypnotic stare and charming, intense manner make him an ideal vampire count. And Frye deserves a nod for one of the nastiest, maddest, creepinest performances in cinema history. Sort of a nuttier, bug-eating Gollum (""Not when I can get nice fat spiders!"").

The original ""Dracula"" is still the best, more than seventy years after it was made. Dripping with Gothic atmosphere and seductive charm, this is a magnificent piece of work.",1248480000,2,3659,5.0447019867549665
3618791,4,B001GPCQKK,"If you follow my reviews, you know that I feel the 1979 ""Dracula"" with Frank Langella as Dracula and Laurence Oliver as Abraham Van Helsing was the best. but it is probably not fair to compare the 1931 Lugosi version to one that would come 48 years later. As the Anglican Church felt the ""King James"" Bible was the best available in 1611, they felt the ""English Revised"" was the best available in 1885.

Moving on, Renfield goes to conduct some real estate business with Count Dracula; but he is surprised at the sympathetic fear he is getting from people in the area. (Nice suspense) Renfield then meets Dracula (Lugosi) who appears to be a decent host. But there is an early sign of horror when Dracula is especially interested when Renfield cuts his finger. Considering the limited resources back then, the scenery is well done. Once in England, we see that Renfield has become a servant of Dracula, and it doesn't take Dracula long to start killing people once he arrives in England. We are then introduced to Jack Seward and John Harker. (Harker is engaged to Seward's daughter Mina.) Mina's friend Lucy is killed which leads to more suspense. Granted, we as the audience know who is killing everyone, but there is some suspense as to when the characters will find out.

We then meet Van Helsing. Van Sloan portrays Van Helsing as an interesting character who has unusual knowledge that he tries to use only when people may be ready for it, or situations are dire enough to share his knowledge. (Van Sloan does not make Van Helsing the heavy drinker he was in the book.)

Harker is a real skeptic, but Seward is understandably more open because he is concerned over his daughter Mina's failing health. Interestingly, we see the good in Renfield is fighting to come out, but he is also afraid of what Dracula may do to him. (Nice suspense that allows us some sympathy for Renfield.) We then see that while Harker is a skeptic, he can be convinced with the right evidence. I don't want to ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen it. But the climax is done reasonably well, and it leaves us with a slightly open ended conclusion.

The 1979 version with Frank Langella as Dracula, Sir Laurence Oliver as Abraham Van Helsing, and Donald Pleasence as Seward will always be my favorite. But I do feel that the 1931 Lugosi version was the best one available in 1931. It remains my 2nd favorite version, and a lot better than a lot of SO CALLED recent Draculas.",1227484800,,2466,4.585034013605442

3618796,4,B001GPCQKK,"Dracula, 1931 film

It starts with a coach in front of a painted background. They make it to the inn by sunset. One man wants to go to Burgo Pass at midnight, the driver doesn't want to travel on Walpurgisnacht. The villagers are afraid of the legend of Dracula and his wives. Renfield the foreigner is not afraid, he disregards the warnings of the local villagers. Inside the castle Dracula awakes, and so do his wives. Renfield meets the coach and his destiny. Dracula bids him welcome (no servants to clean the rooms?), and wants to lease Carfax Abbey in England. A ship has been chartered. [There is a sense of dread and doom in these scenes.] The 'Vesta' sails for England, a terrible storm attacks the ship, yet it arrives safely. All the crew is dead, the one survivor has gone mad.

Dracula  walks the streets. A young girl is found dead. Dracula meets Dr. Seward at the opera, along with his daughter Mina, Jonathan Harker, and Lucy Western. They will be neighbors. Lucy left her window open at night, a bat hovers outside, then Dracula is inside. Renfield wants spiders. ""Have it your own way"" says the guard. Professor Van Helsing analyzes the blood scientifically. [Note the trick lighting on Dracula's eyes.] Mina has a troubling dream, she has two marks on her throat. Van Helsing notes an anomaly in Dracula's appearance in a mirror. Mina is sucked in by Dracula's personality. We learn about attacks on children by a Lady in White. Van Helsing tries to save Mina by placing wolfsbane by her at night. There is a test of wills between Dracula and Van Helsing; Dracula fails. Mina is now like a changed girl, she seems so alive! Now she likes the night and fog. Is it too late to save her? She is repelled by a cross. Dracula takes Mina away, will she become his bride? There  is a happy ending to this horror film (which has few comic relief scenes).

The concept of a vampyre goes back centuries in recorded history (5,000 years ago in the Epic of Gilgamesh). It represents something of human origin that becomes a human predator. [The aristocracy?] The historic Dracula was a 15th century Warlord (or Count) of Transylvania (beyond the forest) in Wallachia whose foreign policy was to prevent incursions from the Turks after the fall of Constantinople. A good history book will tell you of his domestic policies. Dracula was a contemporary of Richard III or Henry VII of England. The historic Dracula is a Rumanian national hero who helped to keep the country free from foreign domination. He was sent as a young boy to live among the Turks as a hostage and a student of their culture. (This probably tells you more than what you want to know.)

In 1897 Bram Stoker wrote the fantasy novel that made him famous. A mysterious and powerful nobleman from the Continent comes to England to exploit its resources. Was this a symbol for Imperial Germany? Its success said it met the emotional needs of the readers of that day. Around 1929 it was adapted into a Broadway play. Then in 1931 it was made into this classic horror film. I read that this film became much more popular when it was re-released around 1935 because of the rising threat of Hitler. Whatever the power of Dracula, he can be defeated once people learn what is to be done and unite to destroy this monster.

Could Dracula also be a symbol for the Depression which was destroying the well-being of families? One lesson is that those who adopt the life-style of vampires must also be eliminated, another symbol of an unending task. Horror films seem like a way for people to handle the threats and fears that they can't understand. That can explain the recurring success of ""slasher"" films for teenagers, or those urban legends. You'll need this film to better understand the 1979 parody starring George Hamilton.

I read that when Bela Lugosi made this film he learned the script syllable by syllable; you can often hear the pauses. This just underlines his vague strangeness. His biography shows he led a varied and interesting life, both in his native Hungary and after he fled from the counter-revolution. There was a Spanish language version made concurrently. It runs for 104 minutes, the usual time for an ""A"" picture. I suspect that this film also was originally as long, but was cut down to 75 minutes for use as a ""B"" picture afterwards (both part of a double feature).",1482969600,,4358,4.657997399219766

3618802,4,B001GPCQKK,"While theres no questioning the mark it made on film history, Tod Brownings Dracula doesnt quite hold up as well for me as some other early sound horror films like Frankenstein (or some of Browning's other films like ""Freaks"").

For the first half its quite terrific, with gobs of atmosphere, expressionistic lighting, and Lugosis wonderfully odd and edge of campy performance making Dracula far more appealing than the ugly semi-monster of the original novel.  But in the 2nd half, this versions history as a stage play becomes far too clear. There is more and more drawing room talk explaining everything instead of showing it, and many of the most dramatic events occur off-screen, leaving characters to awkwardly come in and tell the others (and us) about them.

As the focus turns more and more away from Dracula himself, and to the much less interesting and more chatty (and less well acted) Van Helsing and Jonathan Harker, it suddenly feels like you're sitting through a mediocre dinner theater production.  Why Browning let the second half change from cinematic to stage bound is a mystery to me.  But it keeps the film more a promising laying of track for future horror to come, with an immortal performance by Lugosi, than a great film in and of itself.",1461628800,,1264,4.8604651162790695

3618813,5,B001GPCQKK,"Universal Studios' 1931 early sound film adaptation of Bram Stoker's famous novel continues to exert a hauntingly eerie mystique even after eight decades. Despite countless subsequent incarnations that run the gamut from  faithfulness to Stoker to making Dracula a hybrid Batman, the image most closely associated with the Count of counts is Bela Lugosi's immortal characterization in Tod Browning's iconic film.

As great as Lugosi is in it - commanding, regal, mesmeric - DRACULA also gives us Dwight Frye's utterly chilling portrayal of Renfield, Dracula's insane, insect eating disciple, and Edward van Sloan as the heroic Prof. van Helsing who luckily knows all about vampires. The climactic confrontation between Dracula and van Helsing is riveting; Lugosi, draped in black with eyes piercing, the very personification of malevolence, and van Sloan in saintly contrast, steadfastly resisting the vampire's pull.

On a cinematic level the film is a veritable triumph of understated horror, a quality that some modern viewers fail to appreciate, perhaps because it is so unlike the later Hammer productions starring Christopher Lee. In the '31 film, we don't even see Dracula's fangs nor see him actually bite into someone's neck. The only onscreen blood to speak of are two closeups of a pricked finger. The aim was to chill, not to shock. To that end, director Browning skilfully sustains a creepy, dreamlike atmosphere that is enriched by Karl Freund's evocative cinematography and Charles D. Hall's grand set design. Dracula's Transylvanian castle, in the opening sequence, is a magnificent depiction of Gothic decay. Shots of possums and armadillos scurrying amidst coffins and emerging from discarded, crumbling furniture still conjure up shudders, as do Dracula's three silent, shrouded vampire wives. The closing scene in the vault at Carfax Abbey also contains this aura of death and decay. What some perceive as continuity gaps are instead opportunities for viewer involvement that stimulate the imagination, and prove more effective than spelling everything out in a spoon fed manner as is the current trend. Contrary to popular belief, DRACULA employs a fair amount of moving camera - pan and dolly shots are so smooth and subtly integrated within the narrative structure, they largely go undetected at initial viewings. If DRACULA seems tame today it's because audiences have been jaded by graphically gory depictions of vampires - it's not the fault of the film, which stands as a stylish tribute to its director and star as well as a landmark of screen horror.

The source for Universal's Blu-ray edition was an original 35mm lavender print struck from the camera negative which does supreme justice to this classic, fully restoring it to its rich pictorial lustre. Inky blacks, bright whites without any burnout, and lush grays are consistent throughout. Thankfully, natural film grain is retained, which is what we'd expect from a faithful 1080p resolution transfer of a film of this vintage. The soundtrack likewise has been cleaned up, and whereas former DVD editions left out Renfield's screams when Dracula strangles him and Dracula's death groans upon being staked by van Helsing, we now hear them all intact. Other audio fixes include the restoration of the garbled bit of music during the opening credits, and the music at the end of the theater sequence which got erased previously. This latest home video presentation is a major leap in improvement all around, giving us the absolute finest version of DRACULA we can hope for.

All the extras - save a new restoration segment - have been bumped over from DVD; DRACULA: Spanish version, two documentaries - The Road to Dracula and Lugosi: The Dark Prince, optional production notes, a photo archive, an alternate audio score by Philip Glass, and two feature commentaries by David Skal and Steve Haberman. Regarding the commentaries, Haberman reflects a more positive view of the film, and nullifies many of the assertions Skal makes regarding Browning's allegedly inept direction and the perceived 'superiority' of the Spanish language version directed by George Melford. In my opinion, there's simply no contest. Browning's film is much better paced while Melford's is too talky due to a stricter following of the script, which Browning improvised during shooting. Lasting 40 minutes longer, the Spanish version shows that more isn't necessarily better. That's mainly because it lacks Lugosi, who is substituted by the completely uncharismatic and mugging Carlos Villarias. Likewise, Pablo lvarez Rubio woefully overacts as Renfield. About the only noteworthy aspects of this version are a few scary glimpses of Dracula's demonic wives and a sexy performance by Lupita Tovar as Eva. It also has the look of Browning's film - having been shot on the same sets - and that's always fun to indulge oneself with.

See the original DRACULA the way it was meant to be seen with this stunning Blu-ray release. When Bela Lugosi intones ""I am... Dracula"" with that impeccable, instantly recognizable accent, you'll BELIEVE it!

My highest recommendation.",1430179200,2,5124,5.279754601226994

3618834,5,B001GPCQKK,"Bram Stoker's vampire novel has been remade dozens of times, but perhaps the best adaptation is the classic Bela Lugosi version. Fairly faithful to the novel and dripping with gothic atmosphere, what really makes ""Dracula"" stand out is the bone-chillingly charming performance by Lugosi.

A solicitor, Renfield (Dwight Frye), is travelling to Count Dracula's castle for a real estate deal, despite the locals freaking out and crossing themselves whenever Dracula's mentioned. He soon finds out why -- the Count (Lugosi) is a vampire, who enslaves a mad Renfield to his will. Soon after, a ship with a dead crew (and Renfield and Dracula in the hold) arrives in England.

Soon Dracula has moved into his new home, Carfax Abbey, and is insinuating himself with the Seward family -- and especially with pretty Lucy Westenra, who dies of blood loss and is reborn as a vampire. Only the intervention of the mysterious Dr. Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) can stop Dracula's attacks in London.

Then there's the Spanish-language one, which is virtually identical and was filmed on the exact same sets, during the hours when the English-language one was not being shot. Same settings, same marks, same cinematography, many of the same scenes -- although it's much longer. It's excellent, and although it lacks that iconic intensity that Lugosi brought the English-language film, it's full of atmosphere and good acting.

Technically ""Dracula"" wasn't the first adaptation of ""Dracula"" -- that honor belongs to ""Nosferatu"" -- but it was the first to actually tackle the storyline in Stoker's book. And to date, it's perhaps the only to portray everyone's favorite vampire with the necessary atmosphere -- ominous, dignified and creepy.

Tod Browning sets it in all the necssary places -- crumbling castles, savage mountainous villages, foggy London streets, and sumptuous Victorian drawing rooms with eerie noises from outside. Granted, a fair amount of stuff is changed -- Jonathan Harker is partially replaced by the mad Renfield -- but none of these really detract from the storyline.

And Browning pours the creepiness on thickly, such as Dracula's seduction of young women, which keeps up the whole idea of vampiric sexuality. But Browning also knows how to pour on the subtle horror, without blood or violence -- like any scene with Renfield.

The script is just as great as the direction, with some unspeakably good dialogue (""For one who has not lived even a single lifetime, you're a wise man, Van Helsing""), usually from Dracula. But the best scenes and dialogue are made up of highlights from the novel (such as Dracula saying dreamily, ""Listen to them, the children of the night. What music they make!"").

But the star of all this is Lugosi himself, one of the two quintessential vampire actors (the other being Christopher Lee). While he doesn't resemble the book's Dracula, his hypnotic stare and charming, intense manner make him an ideal vampire count. And Frye deserves a nod for one of the nastiest, maddest, creepinest performances in cinema history. Sort of a nuttier, bug-eating Gollum (""Not when I can get nice fat spiders!"").

The original ""Dracula"" is still the best, more than seventy years after it was made. Dripping with Gothic atmosphere and seductive charm, this is a magnificent piece of work.",1391212800,2,3313,5.097785977859779

along with tons of special features
2 Audio commentary tracks by Historian David skal and another commentary by Steve Haberman
who wrote the screenplay for Dracula-Dead and Loving it
plus the Road to Dracula Documentary which is retrospective featurette on the film and couple other featurettes
the U.S. version released in 1931 is based on a stage play
cause Universal had a very tight budget so the production was cut that is why the film looks like a play on stage actually
and only goes for 75mins
the Spanish version does go longer about 1 hr 40mins which is about 105mins
i have watched both versions
the spanish version is very similar to the U.S. version but with extra scenes of course
the spanish producers had lot more money to spend
Great Camera work which was ahead of it's time way back in 1931
personally i prefer the spanish version cause it's more superior version than the U.S. version
on this new blu-ray reissue both versions have been given the same 1080p transfer
and the same 2.0 master audio mix
the picture quality for the spanish version does look amazing the best the film has ever looked actually
but there are some scenes in the castle where the picture quality has deterioated a little there's lot of lines on the screen
the first scene right through til Dracula looks at the Lease on Carfax abbey is very clean picture
maybe some of the original negatives were damaged and couldn't be fixed, it's anybody's guess why

Of all the films, Dracula looked the worst and when they started releasing these titles on Blu ray I decided that Dracula would be the one film that I would upgrade.  I will say that Universal did an excellent job on restoring this film.  Scratches, blotches and other artifacts of age have been removed and while I won't go as far as to say the film looks like it was made yesterday it doesn't look like a film made over 80 years ago.  About the only time it looked better is when it was first shown on screens in 1931.  All of the extras in the original DVD, and then some, are included here.  If you are looking to upgrade, or buy the film for the first time, you can purchase with confidence.
Why not give it 5 stars?  The restoration deserves that but the film itself shows its stage play origins, especially when it leaves the castle, and can be dull for modern audiences.  But that's a small nit to pick.",1379721600,2,1009,4.358288770053476
3618840,5,B001GPCQKK,"Although I've seen this classic Universal film dozens of times starting at about age 10, this is my first look at the excellent Blu ray transfer available as a stand-alone film or part of the ""Classic Monsters: The Essential Collection.""

The well-known tale stars Bela Lugosi in his most recognizable role. The Hungarian actor also played the character in the stage production from which much is adapted for this early talking picture. Some will snicker at the mannerisms and heightened theatrics more common in the theater. Even as a great admirer of the movie, I chuckle when I see a couple armadillos scurrying across Dracula's Transylvanian castle.

Lugosi, still struggling with English accentuates his dialog not only with an unusual cadence, enunciating each syllable but seemingly each letter. But Bela was a charmer, especially of the ladies which transformed the Count from the Dracula in Bram Stoker's novel and the first production on film, ""Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horror"" (1922). In F. W. Murnau's film, the Count (Orlok) was ugly, sinister and more in tune with what Stoker had in mind.

One of the things that always bothered me about the film was the lack of a musical score. The story has extended moments of silence, except for noise coming from old tape or DVD transfers. The cleaned up version here, eliminates almost all of the surface noise, and makes the silence even more...well silent. I much prefer the included optional Philip Glass score performed by The Kronos Quartet. I was fortunate to see Glass perform this live accompanying the film a few years ago in Dallas.  Which ever audio track you prefer, the sound quality has never been better.

This exquisite 1080p transfer maintains the original 1.33:1 aspect ratio and includes a DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 (mono) option. It is the way to go. Extras include some interesting short documentaries including one introduced and narrated by producer Carl Laemmle's niece who had a small role in the film which included the first words spoken. The package also includes a Spanish language version which was filmed using the same sets at the time, a couple commentary tracks, trailers and more. If you are a fan, you'll want this Blu ray.

""DRACULA"" (SPANISH LANGUAGE VERSION): When Tod Browning's game-changing Dracula was being filmed in Hollywood, a Spanish language version was being filmed at night using the same sets and a slightly altered script. In some ways, this is actually a better movie. Unfortunately in some ways it is not.

The first noticeable element is that the film runs nearly 30 minutes longer. Much of this actually provides some context and continuity especially during the voyage of Dracula from Transylvania to England. Some of the length is also just laborious dialog. There are two big improvements over the English language version. First, the creepy atmosphere lingers throughout the movie, rather than just on those early scenes in Drac's castle. For example, when Dracula rises from his daytime slumber, wisps of smoke exude from his coffin before he is seen.

Secondly and most importantly, the leading lady, Lupita Tovar is much sexier and a better actress than Helen Chandler. Now Eva (rather than Mina) has a clear attraction for the Count. Her clothing reveals a bit of d&eacute;colletage rather than Chandlers buttoned up look. Here Lucia is played by beautiful Carmen Guerrero although her role is scaled back. Like Eva, Lucia is taken with Drac's charms.

To offset these improvements however are two more issues. First and foremost, Carlos Villarias' Dracula is, well...terrible. His over-acting is often laughable to say the least. Bela Lugosi certainly is much better and inhabited the role. I would also point out that in this Spanish version, Renfield takes on a much bigger role and like Villarias, Pablo Alvarez Rubio is no match for his counterpart, Dwight Frye in the English-language version. All in all, this is an interesting comparo to the better known Dracula and is all the better with this Blu ray update included on the same disc.",1373587200,31,4062,5.032738095238095

Released in 1931 Dracula is probably the most influential vampire film ever made and one of the biggest hits in the legacy of Universal Pictures. Since its release the good portion of vampire films have taken many elements from this film and every actor to portray Count Dracula is directly inspired by Bela Lugosi (and from time to time Christopher Lee). As much as I enjoy Dracula I'd rate it behind the first 3 Frankenstein films as well as the Wolf-Man, but with that said I actually think in some ways Dracula might hold up a little better than those films (along with the Wolf Man). Obviously in many areas the film is dated as 1931 is far, far behind us and times change and filmmaking techniques change. But I still find Dracula to be an effective chiller and while it may no longer be scary it's still loaded with eerie atmosphere and I'd go as far to say that since the end of the 30s (and even the 40s) many horror films lack the eerie feel many films from this era had. Reading some reviews it's quite a shame the modern audience are for a good portion complete dolts who laugh at the film. You don't have to love the film, but its clear on some reviews these people aren't very bright. By today's standards Dracula may no longer be scary, but I can easily see how this film scared the hell out of audiences in 1931, but its a shame so many cannot appreciate this film for the classic is it since its still a highly enjoyable film. Like I said compared to other Monster movies I'd rate Dracula behind them and in the career of Tod Browning this is his most popular film and by far is most influential and his legacy, but personally I preferred Freaks, The Devil-Doll and Mark of the Vampire (also with Lugosi and a remake of Browning's now lost silent film London After Midnight starting Lon Chaney, Sr).

I think everyone knows the plot behind Dracula so there isn't a reason to rehash it, but as I mentioned before obviously Dracula will be dated, but I still think the film holds up very well and the script by Garrett Fort based off the Bram Stoker novel is well written and plotted and quite honestly I think the script would work well even today with obviously a few changes here and there. Garrett Fort writes an excellent film with mostly solid characters. As the film gets heavier in dialogue it does slightly drop off, but I'd say that's more on the direction than the writing. Fort's screenplay is a winner and set the bar for vampire films and while this wouldn't be my favorite vampire film the iconic status of the film has never been topped and probably never will.

Director Tod Browning came from the silent era and if not mistaken this was his first talking picture and it does sort of show as Dracula can be a little rough, but this greatly adds to the film. Sometimes when a film is a bit raw it adds to the power and had they been made by a more experienced director results wouldn't be the same. Films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Last House on the Left are rough around the edges, but that in part helps make the films so powerful and while Dracula is a completely different film I think the film being rough around the edges in part helps elevate the film. After Dracula I felt Browning would improve and make better films from a technical standpoint. Even though Dracula wasn't my favorite Tod Browning film there are many aspects of the film I love than the films I liked more than this one. There are also stretches with no dialogue (mostly early in the film) and its almost like a silent film and this is where Browning really succeeds. Obviously the film is dated and certain techniques are decades and decades out of date, but even to this day Dracula still has plenty of eerie atmosphere and still retains a lot of its mystery and suspense. While this isn't my favorite Universal Monster film I do think it might hold up the best. I love the visual look of Dracula and the scenes in Dracula's castle in the opening is brilliant; I love the far wide shots and the lack of music really adds to the eerie feel and when I say Dracula holds up well I think the scene in Dracula's castle is highly effective to this day. The 2nd half of the film when it gets a bit more heavy on dialogue, Dracula does slightly lose its edge and it seems to me the most effective scenes are those with little dialogue, but even as the film slips a little, Browning still crafts an eerie and mysterious film.

Dracula is the film that made Bela Lugosi an icon and there is very good reason for that; while some debate on Lugosi or Chris Lee for me there is no debate about it or on anyone else to play Count Dracula. Bela Lugosi is by far the best actor to ever play the role and nobody will ever top it. Lugosi is quite creepy and delivers one of the all time great performances. Edward Van Sloan sadly is forgotten by may despite starring in several of Universal Monster films. Besides Dracula he also appeared in the sequel Dracula's Daughter, Frankenstein and the Mummy and as Van Helsing I'd go as far to say Edward Van Sloan is just as brilliant as Lugosi and like how nobody has topped Lugosi as Dracula, nobody in my opinion has topped Van Sloan.

Dracula is one of the all time greats and while the play like feel can hinder the film I again also feel the film holds up well and is still an eerie film. Lugosi and Van Sloan are a joy to watch and this is the vampire film that forever shaped those kind of films and the horror genre as a whole.

(Blu-ray review section is based off the Monster box set, the solo release will be the same edition).

At the time of the blu-ray release Dracula was 81-years old and Universal delivers a brilliant transfer. Clarity and detail is nothing short of amazing and due to the age of the film Universal could have put less effort and people would chalk it up to age, but Universal stills shows respect for one of the films that helped shape the studio and this is by far the best Dracula has ever looked on home video. The audio is also excellent as gone is the hissing noise and you can now hear things you couldn't on past releases. Extras are all carried over from past releases and as an extra Spanish Dracula makes its HD debut as well.",1373068800,7,6541,4.407622203811102

8306564,5,B001GPCQKK,"As I watch and otherwise enjoyed the classical 1931 Dracula film starring Bela Lugosi, one scene repeated several times, disturbed me. Im not sure of the meaning of what I saw. In the beginning of the film, when Dracula is first introduced to viewers, we see him wearing an oversized necklace with the star of David, the Jewish star, hanging at the end of the necklace.  He does not wear this necklace in latter scenes. The unusually large size of the star of David seems to be the films desire to call attention to it. It seems to recall the many blood libels brought against Jews claiming that Jews need to drink blood for ritual purposes. This seems to equate Jews to Dracula who also needs to drink blood. This 1931 film was produced at a time when anti-Semitism was widespread, especially in Germany.
There were about 150 recorded cases of blood libel, not counting cases that were not reported, where Jews were arrested, often tortured, and often killed following these false charges. Among many, in 1928, less than three years before the Dracula production, Jews in Massena, New York, where falsely accused of killing a young girl for her blood.
While Bram Stokers fictional Dracula is based on Vlad Tepes, a Christian, did the producers of Dracula want us to see Dracula as a Jew?",1507593600,,1288,4.699115044247788
