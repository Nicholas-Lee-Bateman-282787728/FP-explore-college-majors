2612934,2,B000GI3KDK,"The series is great but if you can't understand what is being said it isn't that great.  Season 2,3,4 had English caption but season five only had spanish and french.  I would like to see a verison with English Subtitles.",1163116800,4,221,4.5
2612935,3,B000GI3KDK,"(sorry for my poor English)

I think that the publishers rushed through season 5 to get it finished.

First of all (and what a BIG shame!) is that they didn't put English subtitles on the DVD's. Especially for non-English speaking people (like me), it's sometimes hard to follow what everybody is saying, like in Operation's briefings etc. I hope that the publishers will consider this and will bring out a new version with the English subtitles.

Second, the packing isn't as nice as with the previous seasons. A cheap box, no booklet but only a few sheets inside the DVD holder etc.

Well, I didn't watch this season yet, but I hope the content will compensate above!",1162598400,3,669,4.6923076923076925
2612936,4,B000GI3KDK,"I love, love the series, but was disspointed in season 5. It was pretty much all over the place, it had no ""rhythm"", didn't make too much sense. Unlike the other seasons, I couldn't wait to finish the last few episodes. Also, strange that it only had French and Spanish subtitles. Would've been nice to add English. I had forgotten what season 5 was like and with good reason, I didn't want to remember. But I still love La Femme Nikita. One of the best series out there. Too bad it left me wanting some sort of ""closure"", other than what was delivered.",1162166400,,553,4.378640776699029
2612937,1,B000GI3KDK,"It would appear that the series producers have noe grabbed the cash and run. All the previous sets had subtitles so we could assume the last very rushed set would also-NO.why take the trouble to botjher abouit customers ,just treat them with contempt. Ignore that they have stuggled these years with Micj=haels fractured mumbles English,we had the subs

Now they have the cash and have left us with a very nasty taste

One day if they fall over the word concience and find out its meaning then they might reissue thislast series with English Subtitles,but we will not hold our breath

2612938,5,B000GI3KDK,"At last, the release of La Femme Nikita: The Complete Fifth Season ends the anxious and agonizing wait by devoted fans.  When the plug was suddenly yanked on the 2004 Season Two release, many (including this fan) speculated that the further release of LFN was doomed.  Fortunately, Warner Brothers came through despite these predictions and LFN permanently lives on in crisp DVD format.  Credit and thanks must be given to Warner Brothers for continuing to appease fans despite a modest, if non-existent, mainstream demand for the complete episodes.

Because Season Five is brief at just eight episodes, the LFN creative team was able to focus their attention on crafting an especially enjoyable, thrilling and no-holds barred ride for the viewer.  Other television spy and espionage series too often seem to poke along from point to point to tell an excruciatingly complicated story.  In the series 24 for example, the viewer has to endure endless expository dialog, drama, and pointless action scenes: Lots of big bangs, explosions and gunfire that often lead to a weak cliffhanger at the end of the hour.  Nikita instead uses a more tilt-a-whirl style of story telling: A tilt-a-whirl that doesn't seem to stop!

Season Five picks up where Season Four ended.  Apparently, Season Four was meant to be the last but due to fan demand and too many loose ends, an abbreviated final season was produced.  Ultimately, Nikita accepts her destiny by the eighth episode but not without plenty of hard-hitting action, clever dialog, and plenty of surprises along the way.

The set itself is neatly packaged.  Extras include a recently filmed retrospective by the series production staff and features commentary by actors Eugene Robert Glazer (Paul) and Cindy Dolenc (Quinn).  The scrumptious cancelled scenes are included, as well, giving us fresh, never before seen footage.  One R-rated cancelled scene in particular provides one last eyebrow-raising LFN surprise.  This one was apparently even too racy for risk-taking network USA.

If you own the first four seasons, you'll definitely want this one to complete your collection.  If you're a new fan, buy all five seasons.  You won't be disappointed.",1161475200,3,2195,5.169971671388102
2612939,5,B000GI3KDK,Perfect ending for the greatest show on TV; 'nuff said!,1158969600,4,55,4.6
2612940,4,B000GI3KDK,"I was throughly dissapointed by the 'real' ending to the show, the one before fans demanded more episodes.  Honestly, I was a bit confused during these last 8 episodes, but in the end I was happy to have some answers and conclusions some revelations and even more Michael and Nikita (yum!). While I'm a sucker for happy endings, I knew none could really be had in Section, so these episodes stayed true to the show.  The price could be a little cheaper for only 8 episodes, but with other seasons priced at $60 + what can I expect? I still don't know why they're so expensive. If you're patient (and cheap or poor) wait for a sale, I did.  This is a great series, with wonderful character development. The show, sadly, never really got off the ground floor. Still, devoted LFN fans cheered the show to 5 seasons. I think without even re-runs being showns, you have to buy it on DVD now to get your fix unless you taped all the eps.  While S5 does tie up things and give a more satisfying ending, you can actually get away with only buying season 1-4 and be happy.  But the whole collection is for any real fan. Also, any episode commentary is golden.",1156636800,19,1150,4.380281690140845
2612941,5,B000GI3KDK,"This final ""season,"" though short, was put together because fans demanded that the show be returned to the air and tie up all hte loose ends left after Season 4. And it was done beautifully. It may only be 8 episodes, but for any La Femme Nikita fans, it's a must-have.

I won't spoil it for you. Just know that it's good. Very good (as always). Of course, you should buy and watch all the prior seasons FIRST. But that goes without saying to the LFN fan.

I'm sure the fans would have liked the last season to be a full season, but what we got was good enough, and tied up all the loose ends. As well as they can be tied up in the Section universe.

I'm certain the video quality will be of the usually high caliber, as well sa audio. And I'm sure there will be extra features, as usual...

----------

Addendum: Having now received the S5 release, I can comment further that the packaging is slightly different than the prior 4 (attractive book-format) releases. However, the slim cases aren't entirely without their merits. Episodes are listed on the outside slip covers to the thin packs.

Video is excellent as always. There appear to be plenty of deleted scenes (I've gotten into the first disc so far), and I'll assume there will be commentary tracks on some of the other discs as with prior releases.

Again, love the show and it stands up well over time. Frankly, it was ahead of its time, presaging shows like Alias an 24. Can't wait to dive into the rest of the last season! Well worth every penny to own the complete LFN series.",1155254400,36,1540,4.401408450704225
2612942,5,B000GI3KDK,"This final season contains 8 episodes.  Like when Highlander disappeared.  USA Network showed these episodes without any fanfare. It took me over a year to catch all the episodes but it was worth it.  And now anyone who did not get to see all the episodes can see them in one sitting!!!!!

These episodes are more like a miniseries as they answer the questions of how Nikita was ""recruited.""  It reveals who is behind section.

Each episode adds onto the previous upto the conclusion of the series.  Although there is a cliffhanger, everything is tied up in a tidy knot and it is very satifying for devotees of the show.

Peta Wilson and Roy DuPuis again shine as the spy and lovers.  Alberta Walker again gives her ice cold performance as second in command, Madeline.  This seasonette, Edward Woodward makes an appearance and shows that he still has it.

A complete detailed review of this will be written when the DVD is released.",1154822400,52,932,4.656441717791411
2612943,5,B000GI3KDK,"they have to milk us for the [...]first, i still think the price of these sets are a bit to high, and there isn't that many extras on the sets, if WB was smart they would repackage the sets at lower prices like Fox did with the x-files to bring in a new set of fans, chances are someone that has never heard of the show or never watched it will not spend [...]just by reading the back of the box. Nonetheless, kudos to WB for releasing the 5th season of LFN so fast. Season 5 had only 8 episodes and was only brought back for the final 8 episodes because the fans demanded it. Season 5 got mix reactions from fans, myself personally i thought season 5 had to many twists and surprises especially the Micheal twist, probably enough for a whole season but still a very awsome ending to a brilliant show that just didn't have enough promotion and big marketing to catch the eye of a larger audience i always thought airing after wrestling was a big mistake. Anyway it will always be and remain a cult fav. If your anxious to see the 5th season box cover they have it posted at [...]

Nikita, a young girl taken off the streets and from jail due to a crime she did not commit by an elite anti-terrorist/deep ops unit called Section, has learned all the sneaky, dirty, and deadly ways of covert warfare. Now, she is ready to take control of the agency. She is still curious as to why she was chosen, rather quickly, from other people in her same situation. The answer is shocking!

Peta took us through the emotional roller coaster ride of being a new operative with hopes and dreams of leaving Section, to becoming Operations herself.

Her trainer and mentor, the sexy & seductive Michael Samuel played by Roy Dupuis, brought flavor and intensity to the show.  His presence washed us in like a mighty tide and made watching each episode with him down right delicious.

La Femme Nikita was the first truly balanced TV series which incorporated love, intrigue, betrayal, wonderful array of weapons, training and fighting styles and not to forget the non-stop action.  I couldn't ask for anything more from a TV show.

Section One.  The most notorious secret anti-terrorist organization on the planet. Unlike the spin off show ( Nikita) who renamed Section, their portrait of how things ran didn't compare to the harsh truths and methods used by Madeline and Operations, Section One's leaders.

The silly twisting and turning that brought Nikita from a poor helpless victim to becoming the head hancho at Section was just too much to believe. And all of a sudden Section has to send Operations out in the field so he can be killed.  Just fresh out of operatives...sorry.  This would all be a joke if it were funny, but it's not, its just sad and stupid.  One reviewer made a good point, the only way to end the series was for Nikita to get out of section, hopefully with Michael.  If not, then I'll take the last episode of Season 4, over this junk any day.  Nikita standing there with Michael walking away behind her.  Beautiful.",1328054400,3,679,4.299212598425197

But I happen to be one of millions who is hearing impaired, and I also have some problems with English spoken in many international dialects. So...WHY WHY WHY did they release the first 4 seasons with English subtitle captions, for the enjoyment of people like me with admitted hearing loss, and then release Season 5 with NO English subtitles??????????????????????? YES, VERY FRUSTRATING. I happen to know the subtitles track you can switch on or off, is nothing more than a text files with a timing script, only adds a few kilobytes to the DVD, and would add a very minimal cost to the overall production budget. To those who NEED this feature to enjoy a video, it is PRICELESS!

If anyone in any production capacity can read this, PLEASE be sure your product features subs for those who need them. Amazon incorrectly claimed this set had them. Seasons 1 thru 4 do have them.

Come on: is there any other way to end this series than TO LET HER GO?? I put off seeing this last season for ages because I had heard she didn't escape, and that depressed me. I loved watching the show in its first 3 seasons, just to see her cope and hope she would get out eventually (Michael or no Michael).

The only fit ending is that Nikita escapes for good, after having suffered so much in Section. To trap her there for the rest of her life is sadistic. Even in the original movie, the soulless cop-killer Nikita escapes!!

As well as that, what an ignominious end for such a great character as Madeline. She deserved much better writing, and a real confrontation with Nikita at the end would have been more satisfying. What were they thinking?

To me, what made Nikita such a great character was her incredible humanity, heart and sheer life force. That fans are ""deeply satisfied"" to see such a free spirit cooped up in Section for eternity is sad.",1230681600,7,1110,4.378640776699029
2613068,5,B000GI3KDK,"Since Amazon has lost my review of this DVD set, I am resubmitting my original review, as written on March 13, 2008:

While not as gripping as the last half of Season Four or Season One, the producers and writers take the viewer on a wonderful ride into the land of POWER. With twists and turns that were intriguing, the rather subliminal truth of interactions and relationships found in the first four seasons, is now the core of this ""second"" ending of Le Femme Nikita.

As I never watched the show on television, I am unable to really say if the Fifth Season provides what fans at the time wanted or not. However, I do think that further episodes were needed. For me, Season Five ended just as things were getting even more interesting, and, as such, is yet another example of how Warner Brothers (WB) really does not care about their viewers. While they may have ""provided"" these eight episodes, if WB was really listening they would have ensured the show went on.

Lastly, I would like to comment on DVDs by Warner Brothers: they are long on promise of special features, formate, etc., but short on delivering. AND why is there not a single commentary on any episode in the five years by Peta Wilson?

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS November 2, 2008: Many of the people involved with ""La Femme Nikita"" have gone on to work on the immensely better show, ""24.""  However, ""La Femme Nikita"" gives a glance into the underpinnings of the concepts and directions ""24"" has taken, and as such remains a powerful show in its own right.  I cannot say enough about ""La Femme Nikita"" beyond the words I have written in my reviews, and to say it is a show that is tremendously entertaining, dramatic, engrossing, and, to borrow a phrase, ""must watch tv.""",1225497600,,1734,4.5954692556634305

2613083,5,B000GI3KDK,"Having seen most of the series, excluding the first few episodes in series 4, I must say the ending was perfect.  It tied up the loose ends but left a few open.  I cant stand perfectly closed & happy endings.  And not having Michael in every episode was a nice break where we were able to explore the different layers of her whole story. Not just her relationship with Michael.  We have shared all her woes, triumphs & personal/professional development and to see that each step of her journey leads her to her destiny, was fulfilling to say the least.  I have heard a few philosophies that a great leader (or a balanced leader) is one who is reluctant to take on the job.
The look and feel of Series 5 seems more substantial and different from the rest of them.  Many of the episodes on season 1, are still my favourite though.
They should have left in the deleted 'drink' scene between Walter & Operations, because Walter actually gets to the heart of Nikita's & Operations relationship. It just sums it up nicely where as without it you feel something is missing.
Also with the some what of an open ending you know Nikita has her work cut out for her & that the odds are against what she wants to achieve.  But its nothing she hasn't been through before.

It's a shame this quality show was restricted to cable--it is so much better than most network shows.  If you watch all 4 seasons of LFN you will notice many guests from LFN have made appearances on ""24"" the past few years--Operations and Madeline, especially.

Lacking that option, I will re-order this set ... because I'm going crazy not knowing what happened to Nikita between disc 1 and disc 3!]
FOLLOWUP: It's a couple months after my earlier review.  I re-ordered season 5 and when my new hermetically-sealed-in-plastic Nikita arrived, I immediately tested disk 2.  [Notice that I'm spelling disc with a ""k"" this time.]  Guess what!  Absolutely the same problems -- which I won't bother to repeat here.  [If you already forgot what I was raving about, just reread the above portion of this review.]  I have to believe that this newest DVD set was from the same vender ... who got this second set from the same distributor ... who got this second set from the same manufacturer ... who makes all his copies from the same set of master disks, including fatally flawed disk 2.  Is there possibly another place I could order Season 5 from ... with a prayer that a different source would have a functioning disk 2?",1484956800,2,2120,4.514435695538058
