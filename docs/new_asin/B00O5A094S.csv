6723259,2,B00O5A094S,"Even the outstanding performance by Juliette Binoche couldn't save this film from being a dull, pretentious, muddy murk. Is it a political thriller with a conscience? A family drama? Is it a love story, a social statement of our tragic times? Can't a movie be all these things at once? YES - if it's a good movie. Examples: The Constant Gardener, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, The Third Man. (BTW, highly recommend seeing THOSE movies, if you haven't.)  Heck, even a mainstream popular action Bond flick like Casino Royale has a more cohesive, compelling story and characters that weaves all of those elements together. Why didn't it work in ""1,000 Times...""? Heck, if I knew the answer to that question, I'd be raking in the dough advising would-be directors!

I can't tell you why this film didn't work, only that it didn't. And I really wanted it to because I love Binoche. She was kind of wasted here -- her co-actor was not up to snuff; the story had way too many threads and themes; it tried to be different from a Hollywood movie but couldn't rid itself of many cloying cliches and sentimentalism; the editing was ponderous... I don't know. It just felt like it loved itself too much, it took itself really really preciously.  I'm glad I didn't see it in a theater where it would have cost more, and I would have been more mad at the waste of my time. As it was, I was home ill, so I wouldn't have been doing anything better -- well, maybe watching a better movie!",1414368000,10,1476,4.479553903345725
6723280,3,B00O5A094S,"War photographer Rebecca (Juliette Binoche) is one of the best at her job, obtaining the kind of pictures that invariably get published in western magazines as examples of the violence of conflicts in nonwestern areas such as Afghanistan or Kenya.  The only snag is that Rebecca is so obsessed with her work that she cannot understand the damage she is doing to her family back in Ireland, especially her daughter Steph (Lauryn Canny).

The conflict between personal and professional values forms the kernel of Erik Poppe's film.  Yet thematically speaking the director is far more interested in prompting reflection on the photographer's trade.  While Rebecca certainly shows a good deal of bravery in trying to get the best pictures, we also understand that she is something of a voyeur who actively enjoys intruding into her subjects' personal space.  Her fondness for the close-up of suffering people is quite disconcerting, especially in a sequence taking place in the back of an SUV in Afghanistan.  In political terms, she adopts a neocolonialist position of the westerner taking scopophilic pleasure in the power she exerts through her camera.

Perhaps the film's most telling moment occurs back in Ireland, when Steph turns the camera on Rebecca and photographs her repeatedly.  Rebecca cannot endure the experience of the lens pointing at her in such an intense manner and turns her head away, her eyes filling with tears.  Would that Rebecca might understand that her subjects could feel much the same; but if she did so, then she would not be good at her job.

Given the integrity with which Poppe examines this issue, it's rather sad that the film as a whole should be somewhat melodramatic.  In the end the action descends into something of a tug-of-love battle between mother and family; at one point Rebecca bundles Steph and her younger sister Lisa (Adrianna Cramer Curtis) in a pathetic attempt to abduct them from their family home.  Needless to say husband Marcus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) foils the plot and eventually looks after the girls himself.

The film makes a half-hearted attempt to draw a parallel between Rebecca's wanderlust and the rhythms of the tide (her daughter observes that the photographer is like the sea, coming and going), but unfortunately outstays its welcome: the last half-hour unfolds slowly but predictably towards an inevitable denouement.  This is a shame, given the seriousness of its basic premise - almost as if director Poppe had lost the courage of his convictions.",1458000000,2,2520,5.099756690997567

There's so many different messages to take from this film, depending on the viewer. Binoche plays a celebrated photojournalist whose husband threatens to leave because she is constantly putting herself in danger. There's a strong contrast to how she is viewed at home (terrible mother) and then how she is viewed by the general public (a top professional). Basically, a struggle similar to what many working mothers face, but just played out in the grand and dangerous scale of international war zones. The ending is really brilliant. The final messages is up to the viewer: is she a mother who is unable to connect and takes too many risks, an adrenaline junkie who can't quit, or is she a crusader selflessly making the world a better place, unfairly judged and held back by an unsupportive husband who is too basic to understand her mission.",1426809600,,959,4.748502994011976
6723313,5,B00O5A094S,"Spoilers:  There were behaviors of the family that I found more disturbing than the fact that Rebecca was a war photographer.  And I found these behaviors to be fueled by antiquated attitudes towards women.  After watching this film, do you think that this movie would have been as believable if the roles were reversed?  Would the wife leave the husband because an accident happened and once again he was at risk because of his profession?

Basically, Rebecca returns home after a dangerous accident while on the job.  She realizes that her family needs her and decides, with much deliberation, that she is going to quit her profession as a war photographer.  Given that she has been away, and perhaps because she is female, I sensed the guilt that most working mothers have when they have to sacrifice family for the job.  This guilt makes her more vulnerable to wanting to please all the different family members.  Which can only lead to trouble and it does.

Her littlest daughter wants a kitten, so Rebecca gets her a kitten.  The oldest daughter wants to go to Kenya with her mom for some intense quality mom and daughter time under the guise of a school project.  However, Rebecca reminds everyone that she has quit and that those types of situations are never as safe as they say they are.  But no one listens to her, instead, the father, Marcus, joins in and pushes Rebecca into taking Steph to Kenya.  They are playing on Rebecca's emotional needs to be loved, forgiven for being away, and her desire to make everyone happy.  So they go; and, sure enough there is a violent incident.  Of which Steph tells her mom not to say anything about it to Marcus.  Big mistake - we all know that - Rebecca knows that - but she LOVES her daughter so much that she is willing to do foolish things for her.  Well, sure enough, Marcus accidentally finds out about the violence on the trip and that Rebecca reprized her war photographer's role and went head first into the melee.  Marcus blows his noodle and throws Rebecca out effectively ending their marriage.  The daughter, Steph, doesn't have one courageous toe in her entire being.  She doesn't seem to explain to her father anything about what happened or that her mom didn't talk to him about it because she had asked her not to.  They had effectively set Rebecca up for failure at home.  She was just cut off and thrown out like yesterday's garbage.

The attitude that I picked up on is that Rebecca should not be causing her family worry because of her dangerous job.  They were sick of worrying about her.  And I got sick of hearing Rebecca apologize to them over and over again.  I just wanted to smack her family into rationality.  So let me put this situation into the perspective that I see.

If Rebecca was actually a Robert; and Robert was a fireman, and there was a fire that required someone to go into a burning building and retrieve a child; and Robert was out with his wife having dinner; and Robert responded as a fireman would, should the wife get pissed off that he put her in a position where she had to worry and so she should kick him out of their house and end their marriage?

I wondered where was the support for Rebecca?  Why didn't Marcus ever apologize for emotionally pushing his wife into that situation when she had already made her decision and then get mad at her for reacting according to her long career as a war photographer?  Where was Marcus's character?  I just felt that the husband, Marcus, and the two daughters were very selfish and self absorbed.

In the end, I was glad that the marriage broke up because I thought that Rebecca should have been treated better, and been given more support and love.  I thought she could find a better person to share her life with than Marcus.

Other than that gripe - the movie is fantastic and very worth watching.  Of course, Juliette is magnificent as usual and the visuals are excellent as well.",1426636800,,3929,4.561428571428571

6723315,3,B00O5A094S,"In A Thousand Times Good Night Juliette Binoche (The English Patient) is Rebecca, an acclaimed photo journalist severely wounded while in Afghanistan. Rebecca returns to her family quietly living in Ireland, takes a rest and enjoys the life there, but soon finds herself torn between two roles: that of journalist whose work involved traveling to the troubled regions, and that of wife of her worried husband, and of mother of two daughters.

Juliette Binoche delivers a riveting performance as Rebecca, and the supporting cast is all very good, especially Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Game of Thrones) as her husband trying to understand her, and Lauryn Canny as Rebeccas elder daughter attracted to what her mother does.

However, some of the episodes are not very convincing. Do you really agree to bring your child (who wants to collect materials for her school project) to a refugee camp in Kenya, simply because someone you know says it is perfectly safe? Especially when you are a professional photo journalist who is supposed to know better?

Maybe. Even so, directed by Norwegian-born Erik Poppe, who himself was a press photographer, the Irish-Norwegian film feels a little too contrived and perhaps self-absorbed, too. Thanks to the wonderful acting from Juliette Binoche, A Thousand Times Good Night certainly makes a good point about being a journalist and its addictive aspect, but once the point is taken, the film has not much else to say.",1424995200,3,1449,5.13135593220339

6723318,5,B00O5A094S,"We saw ""1,000 Times Good Night"" as part of the wonderful Film Movement"" program.  It's one of their strongest entries to date.  The film is a fascinating production: conceived, produced and directed by Norwegians (with a premiere there); starring French and Danish leads whom the script -- not attempting to hide their provenance -- has settled in Ireland; featuring Irish children of the French/Danish parents; and with filming split across Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Morocco (as a stand-in for Afghanistan) and - most notably - Kakuma Refugee Camp in Kenya.

Sound like a recipe for a mess? Well, against the odds, no.  This film -- a brilliant creation from writer/director Erik Poppe -- is a gripping, relentlessly watchable affair.

In Poppe's script, we're confronted with the question: how does home-life go for the photographer whose life work is spent in conflict zones?

Answer: not well. Juliette Binoche's Rebecca suffers through a near-mortal shock in Kabul.  Post-trauma, she tries to leave her adrenaline-fueled life behind and work on domesticity.  At loose ends and a relative stranger to her kids, she's coaxed into a visit (as a guest of an NGO) to a refugee camp in Kenya.  Terming it a ""safe camp"" from her experience, she convinces husband Marcus (great, taciturn performance by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) that she'll take daughter Steph (Lauryn Canny - all that is good about Ireland) along for bonding (& to ace Steph's school project to boot).

All I'll say here: does NOT go according to plan.

Ultimately, at movie's end, Rebecca ends up back in Kabul.  Watch for the subtle, powerful ending, beautifully underplayed by Binoche.  I'd seen her on some 2014 Best Actress lists for this performance.  She needed to be on more.  She remains one of the world's finest actresses.

6723325,5,B00O5A094S,"As this movie opens, photojournalist Rebecca (Juliette Binoche) is deep in the Middle East, Afghanistan, on assignment. She is extremely passionate about what is happening in the world and puts herself directly into war zones to gain a story firsthand. What she does at the onset is enough to take your breath away, it was horrific to view through Rebecca's lens. I oftentimes wondered how pictures of these situations are ever taken.  Rebecca is the type of person who is able to desensitize from any fear, put herself in these impossible to believe circumstances and make them a reality for the world to see. What we view directly at the start we will also view in the end ... although with quite a strikingly different and more haunting circumstance.

When Rebecca returns home to Ireland after a long hospitalization, we understand that she is also married to Marcus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) and they have two daughters. Steph (Lauryn Canny) is the oldest of the two along with a younger sister, Lisa. These three are back home while Rebecca leaves for her assignments that take her to faraway dangerous places. Maria Doyle Kennedy (""The Commitments"") and Larry Mullen Jr. (U2) represent Rebecca's direct family in Ireland and have small but important roles. The family is getting very distraught about how or if their wife, mother, and sister will come home. Marcus is a marine biologist working with situations on the Irish coastline, so one can only imagine how beautifully atmospheric this film is (John Christian Rosenlund). There is so much detail in the shots of the middle east and of Ireland. It would certainly be an oversight to not mention such an attribute to this film.

Marcus cannot risk his feelings about family any longer concerning the one time that his wife may not return from assignment. Rebecca is, therefore, defensive concerning the things that Marcus fell in love with about her in the first place; her passion, her fire. If Marcus once loved her for these very same traits, then why are they the things he cannot handle now? The children are equally upset about losing their mother to wars in countries that may not be in a position of helping. This is until Steph begins learning about the disturbing conditions in Kenya, Africa. She asks her mother to help her with her school project about the injustices in Kenya and whatever she can do to learn more. This is where these parents make a huge mistake. The decision is from Marcus as Rebecca has conceded to an ultimatum to keep her family intact. What happens from this decision turns the conflict on its head as the film itself surrounds the conflict in Rebecca to be able to do what she is angry and passionate about. Her fervor springs from deep inside of her and exposing the hostile world in which we live through photography is woven into her nature. It wasn't easy to feel what this whole family is feeling as abandonment, anger, and conflict anchor these situations and ground the movie.

Erik Poppe co-wrote along with Harald Rosenlw-Eeg and directs this film where the beginning and the end are equally brutal, just a huge bit different. The film moves at a slow pace that, for me, kept building conflict and abandonment paralleling the same issues in Rebecca. The comparison can be made that Rebecca's decision at the end is positively heartbreaking in its making. How far will she go and what sacrifices must be made for Rebecca and her family to remain together?",1421020800,3,3459,4.818181818181818

Academy Award winner Juliette Binoche stars as Rebecca, a war photojournalist. Rebecca is fearless, going to the front lines in war torn zones, putting herself in extremely dangerous situations. While documenting a suicide bomber in Afghanistan, she is badly hurt. It is only when she is in the hospital that we learn she is a wife and mother - and that her husband has had enough. An ultimatum is issued - her job or her family....

I was drawn in from the opening scenes of this film, fascinated and then horrified as I realized what was happening. The juxtaposition between the chaos of the opening few scenes and then cutting to the peaceful Irish countryside is jarring. And it mirrors Rebecca's feelings, emotions and state of mind.

Conflict, desire, want and need are wound throughout the film - the wars Rebecca covers, the struggle between staying at home and capturing conflict and exposing it to the world, to tamp down her desire to be where the action is, the need to document these atrocities for the world, the wanting to be a good mother, wife and friend and more.

Binoche is a brilliant actor. Her performance in this film is remarkable - moving and oh so believable. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau plays husband Marcus. He too, turned in a good performance  - I understood his need to protect his daughters, but I grew angry with his behavior. Young Lauren Canny plays daughter Stephanie. The scenes between her and Rebecca are poignant, as Steph slowly comes to understand what it is her mother does - and why.

As I watched, I was thinking to myself how well this film was done - the cinematography, the attitudes, the passion and the drive to expose atrocities to the world. It was only in the film's bio section that I discovered that director Erik Poppe was a war photojournalist himself in the 1980's. He too went through the same personal and professional conflicts he's given to Rebecca.

6723370,5,B00O5A094S,"The marvellous Juliette Binoche stars as Rebecca a photo journalist. We meet her in Afghanistan taking a series of photos of a woman who is being prepared for a suicide bombing. Like all journalists - she is there to observe - not interfere, but she gets caught up in the whole extreme drama and is involved in the explosion.

Her husband Marcus - Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (`Game of Thrones') brings her home to Ireland and their two daughters for her to make a full recovery. It is then that the past catches up with her and she finally sees the dreadful emotional toll that her work is having on her family. However, she has always been driven by her passion to make the World see what really happens in conflict zones and that sort of passion is hard to suppress. Add to that the fact that she has become a celebrity for her work and the choice between family and work becomes ever more difficult to make.

There is an awful lot in this film and I did feel at one time that issues were not being addressed properly. The early scenes of the suicide bomber's friends crying as they said goodbye to her got me thinking. She seemingly has a choice about her death but her victims will never even be allowed the chance to say goodbye as she is doing - and that is both hypocritical and very sad. The issues around being an unwelcome voyeur, as some photographers are seen, are addressed but the real story here is the ripples that war has around the world and for those caught up in it.

I found this to be a very moving and quietly powerful film; it has a natural rhythm which is helped by the wonderful musical score and the pacing throughout that knows when to ramp things up and to let them drift. Lauryn Canny playing the daughter Steph is particularly good in a very challenging role, but then everyone gives their best here. It was also a collaborative effort of the likes of The Norsk, Swedish and Irish film boards and is mainly in English with a bit of Norwegian. This is a film with high production values, great acting and deals with uncomfortable issues in a caring way and as such I can absolutely recommend.",1417910400,14,2117,4.423076923076923
6723371,5,B00O5A094S,"This film comes right from the headlines. Juliette Binoche plays Rebecca, an acclaimed war photographer who is determined to ""make the world see"" what is happening in the Middle East. She is a daring, dramatic professional who will risk any danger, even to the point of accompanying a female suicide bomber almost to the very end, to be sure she gets the story.  But Rebecca also has another life.  She is married to Marcus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) and has two young daughters. When her zeal for the story almost leads to her death Marcus gives Rebecca an ultimatum: either give up her career or give up her family.

1,000 Times Good Night is a searing portrayal of the choices Rebecca must make and the horrors with which she is confronted. It is a story that has a familiar ring to anyone who has followed the news from the Middle East over the past 15 years, but Binoche's portrayal of Juliette's determination gives it a fresh aspect.  I also appreciated one of the subplots which details the methods by which the Pentagon seeks to control the story through the use of embedded reporters and photographers.  This is an important film which will haunt its viewers.",1417651200,,1166,4.724137931034483
6723372,5,B00O5A094S,"A film about a female investigative journalist is bound to raise a reaction among viewers, especially when the atrocities filmed are so brutal. But that is the point being made by writer/director Erik Poppe (with added written material by Harald Rosenlw-Eeg and Kirsten Sheridan). The main character in this story is Rebecca (a radiant and brilliant Juliette Binoche), one of the world's top war photographers. She must weather a major emotional storm when her husband Marcus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) refuses to put up with her dangerous life any longer. He and their young daughters - especially Steph (Lauryn Canny) but also the much younger Lisa (Adrianna Cramer Curtis) - need Rebecca, who, however, loves both her family and her work. Rebecca has been angry, since a child, over the way people around the globe focus on the detritus of local news and pay little attention to the horrors that occur daily in the countries besieged by terror. Rebecca resolves to take Steph (at Steph's request) to Kenya where inadvertently they witness terrorist acts even though Rebecca had been promised the area was safe. The result of Rebecca's endangering her daughter results in her marriage dissolving, but other changes in Rebecca's smoldering anger and angst result also.

The film is very well photographed and both Binoche and Coster-Waldau are excellent. The supporting cast is strong (especially a very small bit part for Maria Doyle Kennedy) and the musical score by Armand Amar is deeply moving. The film places before us the incalculable struggles war correspondents face but at the same time it brings to out attention just how impossibly difficult life in troubled countries can be.

6723377,4,B00O5A094S,"An extraordinarily moral story about the choices we all make to look or to look away. Binoche plays a conflict photographer who has been in danger too many times. Her husband and daughters are unraveling in complex ways when she is home and when she is on assignment. Coster-Waldau plays the dad who stays at home whose fears for everyone in his family overwhelm his love for his wife. Coster-Waldau plays a man so entirely different from his ""Game of Thrones"" character that he is nearly unrecognizable. There is not a cell of Jaime in this character's body. So fans of that show might be put off by C-W's ability to inhabit a post modern man on this planet.

Binoche is addicted to her project: forcing those of us who live in relative safety to look at the consequences of global violence. Each family member experiences a different facet of what seems like abandonment. The world abandons conflict zones; the mother abandons her children; the wife abandons her husband; the husband abandons what he used to love about his wife. If you see negative reviews for this delicately made film, I'd wager those negative reviews are more about the viewer's abandonment of the moral question. When there is suffering just around the corner, or over the hill, or across and ocean, just how do we separate ourselves from it in the post modern age of instant access via media representation? If we do not separate ourselves, we might die, but if we do, our soul has made a bargain with the devil.",1415491200,31,1487,4.675572519083969

So much so that it starts by glamourizing a suicide bomber preparation to assassinate blowing up dozens of innocents in a market (with the complicity of the main character) as miss Afghanistan (advertising approach even to this fundamental of issues). Both criminals, the bomber and the photographer, glorified beyond the politics and the ethics of what they both are doing.  It is shocking that such above all stupid film has been so well received.",1462060800,,825,5.156716417910448
