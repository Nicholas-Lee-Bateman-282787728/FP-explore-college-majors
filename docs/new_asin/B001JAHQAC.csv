One of my adult children said the first 8 years were available at Amazon so I purchased 1-8 and later 9-11. I was all worked up about season 12 until I realized that will be all those I watched on TVLand, 1967. Maybe the rights were sold but in any case, I'm less excited than I was. I think I need 14-20.",1465516800,,447,4.149425287356322
8312367,5,B001JAHQAC,"Gunsmoke is one of the best television shows up all time. In ran on CBS from 1955 to 1975 for 20 years. The only other drama that ever lasted that long was Law and Order 1990 to 2010. Gunsmoke had 635 episodes, and the main actor never left, which has become a common problem for TV shows. The first 11 season of gunsmoke have been released on DVD, but there are still 9 seasons to go, and it has been a while since season 11 was released. Season 11 was the last season that was shot in black and white. All the other seasons afterwards were shot in color. It would be a great shame if they stopped restoring the seasons and releasing them just as they were reaching the color years of the show. Possibly they think that no one is interested any longer, but they would be wrong. I am only 21 years old, and I want to watch every episode of gunsmoke. I cannot be the only young person who is interested in this show, and other classic shows such as bonanza. If one 21 year old could be interested in a show as old as gunsmoke, then there must be many others. I have noticed a lot of comments saying that they should hurry up releasing the rest of the seasons of gunsmoke. I saw a lot more comments then I expected, which is very good news. It shows that the public is interested. If only the developers of the dvd's would take notice to that and restore the rest of the seasons of gunsmoke on DVD.",1464998400,,1396,4.154981549815498

8312373,5,B001JAHQAC,"Check the TVShowsOnDVD site for  news on season  12 of Gunsmoke,- Release Date at Amazon. Ca announced for Sept. 20 2016; This will be another 2 package set.

The GUNSMOKE TV series ran from September 10, 1955, to March 31, 1975, on CBS with 635 total episodes. It was the second western television series written for adults, premiering , four days after The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp
Gunsmoke was TV's No. 1 ranked show from 1957 to 1961 before slipping into a decline after expanding to an hour. In 1967, the show's 12th season, CBS planned to cancel the series, but widespread viewer reaction (including a mention in Congress and the behind-the-scenes pressure from the wife of CBS's president) prevented its demise and so the network cut Gilligan's Island instead .The show continued in its new time slot at 8 pm on Mondays. This scheduling move led to a spike in ratings that saw it once again rally to the top 10 in the Nielsen ratings until the 1973  74 television season. Gunsmoke was canceled after a 20-year run; it was replaced by Mary Tyler Moore spin-offs Rhoda and Phyllis
