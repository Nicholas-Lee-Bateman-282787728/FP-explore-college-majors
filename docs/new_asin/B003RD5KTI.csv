8403560,4,B003RD5KTI,"This Spanish dvd is a superior, anamorphic-scope print of Curtis Harrington's cult thriller from the 60s.  The print and magoptical mono soundtrack are highly indicative of the original theatrical release.  The English-language audio option features optional Castilian subtitles (and there's also a Castilian dub).
The film is a tidy, retro thriller made special by an insidious performance from the great Simone Signoret.  Here she brings some diabolical Gallic flair into the household of a couple of brash Americans whose second-rate theatrics just aren't clever enough.  There's a wonderful, trashy chic to the production design, and both Caan and Ross are charming as the young dupes.
There's been no American dvd release in sight for this sweet little thriller, so this import DVD is the only way to go if you're multi-regional and need this minor gem in your collection.",1282348800,2,877,5.287769784172662
