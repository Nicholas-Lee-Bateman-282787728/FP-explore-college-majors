8099123,5,B000CIWXQO,"The performance is the thing.... Jean Rigby is a very affecting Lucretia (a world away from her playful Nancy in ""Albert Herring""), Alan Opie as Junius sets the plot in motion with his challenge to Tarquinius (Russell Smythe), and Richard van Allen is dignified and moving in his reaction to what has happened to his wife. The Male and Female Chorus (Anthony Rolfe Johnson and Kathryn Harries) carry a very large part of the performance with their continuing commentaries on the action. These suggest intense involvement in the ongoing story, but as outsiders recounting, not melodramatic participants. Rolfe Johnson's impeccable diction is especially helpful here (even when viewing with the English-language subtitled turned on). There are also French, German, and Spanish subtitles.
  The English National Opera production is very stark and simple, befitting the starkness of Britten's scoring, with a handful of instruments and the predominant harp during much of the work. The plot is from ancient Rome, and the libretto (in the Chorus' lines) brings in surprising references to Christ's redeeming sacrifice (something I have always found rather odd, but apparently Britten specifically requested int).  The sets and costumes suggest the spare simplicity of a Japanese Noh drama. Some may prefer more action in the physical movement of the singers, or a lusher set, but to me this production highlights the music and the important musical-dramatic moments very effectively.",1444780800,,1478,5.417391304347826
8099124,5,B000CIWXQO,"This is the DVD to get for the well-regarded English National Opera production of Britten's chamber opera, directed by Graham Vick. While this performance might not compare with Benjamin Britten's own authoritative interpretation on CD (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/individual-release/dp/B0000041WC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">individual release</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/budget-box/dp/B000654OU6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">budget box</a>), it is a strong performance and currently the only one on DVD.(*1)

This all British team gives this opera a British feel, even though the story is set in Rome. Conductor Lionel Friend sets the pace intelligently and musically. There is hardly a weak link in the singing cast, but special mention must be made to Jean Rigby's Lucretia and Alan Opie's Junius. Graham Vick's staging is sparse but effective, matching Britten's music very well. There are only two small quibbles I have. First, the engineer slightly over-emphasized the voices at the expense of the instrumental parts. Fortunately, it is not very serious and, at a slightly higher volume level, one can hear all instruments vividly. Second, the displayed subtitles deviate from the exact sung words far more often than usual.(*2)

Currently, there are 2 DVD versions of this performance available. Besides this Arthaus DVD, there is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kultur-edition/dp/B0008FXSS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kultur edition</a>&nbsp;of the same performance. This Arthaus edition, while not perfect, has the following advantage over the Kultur:

1. It is in NTSC and Region 0 (all regions), not in PAL as claimed by Amazon.
2. The sound track, while still of no high fidelity, is encoded in LPCM (CD quality).
3. Most importantly, there are subtitles in English, French, German and Spanish.

The only disadvantage I can see is the price. However,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kultur-s-edition/dp/B0008FXSS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kultur's edition</a>&nbsp;is presented in the handicapped form: no subtitles and in heavily compressed sound (Dolby Digital, mp3 quality). So a few dollars' saving is not really worth it.

The asking price here is a bit high for the Arthaus DVD, but budget-conscious shoppers can find better prices at numerous UK's retail sites, e.g. Amazon's own UK site, and many others.

A strong performance of Britten's masterpiece. Strongly recommended.

(*1) There is a very engaging 2001 Aldeburg Festival production, with Sarah Connolly at the title role. I am hoping that it will appear as a commercial DVD soon. A link to youtube segments will be posted in the Comments.

(*2) Even though it is not unheard of for the singers to substitute words when they experience partial memory lapses (especially in recitatives), in this case I think the subtitle-production is at fault. In the two instances I checked against my Boosey & Hawkes scores, the singers sing the right words while the subtitles are off.",1342915200,8,3160,6.28175519630485
