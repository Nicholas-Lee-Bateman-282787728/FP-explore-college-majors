8415829,5,B00444NN6Q,"What a trip down Christmas past, but remaining as fresh as Christmas yet to come. Bing and Satchmo, always worked so very well together. They had a fun loving friendship that was the real star of any of their grand performances. Bing was first drawn to Armstrong in the late 1920s. He would travel to Harlem clubs to catch a Satchmo session. I can't see anyone not loving this DVD.",1475798400,,381,4.457142857142857
