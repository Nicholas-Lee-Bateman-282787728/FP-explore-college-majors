8047900,1,B0007KY8CO,"I'm a big fan of pilates, and usually use Ana Caban's workouts (put out by Gaiam).  This was my first experience with Stott and I have to say that I will NEVER get another workout from them.  The workout was too easy, and very basic.  It was pretty much a regular pilates routine but with the ring thrown in, so you were doing standard moves like the hundred and the saw, but while holding the ring.  Not quite what I expected.  Its a very slow paced workout, the older lady talk a lot, you only do a few reps of each move, and there is no music. It might be good for someone who has never done pilates before, but if you have, then don't bother with this one.  My biggest problem with this workout was the people in it, and the way it was shot.  The workout is lead by an older lady who stands over a younger man and woman and directs them in what to do.  I didn't really appreciate all the close up, body panning shots of the younger couple in their skin tight leotards....  if you're looking for a good pilates workout, don't bother with this one.  Go check out the Gaiam series instead.",1168992000,4,1090,4.172248803827751
