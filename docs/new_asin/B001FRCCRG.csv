You are now forced to watch the dvd to HEAR the instructor tell you where to play on the neck, which is no small feat when dealing with 32nd notes!!! There isn't a single visual that shows you the scale/lick patterns used for the performances and the accent of the instructor is hard to follow at times. It is such a shame as i could really see myself spending the time required to learn this style of music but my previous experience with LL lessons has soured me in a big way.",1242259200,7,656,4.1328125
