5317347,5,B009D4GPIK,One of my favorite stories from childhood. I purchased the DVD to give to my grandson as a Christmas present. Well worth it.,1355875200,4,124,4.434782608695652
5317348,5,B009D4GPIK,I bought the book expecting to see the illustrations from the video in the book.  They are not in the book and my 7 year old great granddaughter was fascinated with the video and so was I.  Any child interested in drawing would be able to pause the video and copy the drawings.,1353369600,5,277,4.2075471698113205

5317355,4,B009D4GPIK,Truly gorgeous illustrations (many!) and William Hurt tells the story well. My only issue was that it was slow. This could have been told in half the time with better pacing. A pity - because the story actually clips along in traditional retellings and is quite dramatic. I'd still recommend a viewing but be prepared for a little squirming if showing it to kids - even the transitions between scenes are slow.,1425686400,3,410,4.708333333333333

5317363,4,B009D4GPIK,"Although William Hurts voice can be sort of monotonous and a bit slow for kids, I really enjoyed this telling, slightly different from the audio version, but I have shown this to my 2nd grade class and it was just the right amount of creepy for them without being scary.",1402876800,2,270,4.42

5317368,5,B009D4GPIK,I would recommend this story for ages (at the very youngest) 6 and up due to dramatic music and some frightening bits. Wonderful illustrations and powerful story.,1397001600,2,162,5.037037037037037
