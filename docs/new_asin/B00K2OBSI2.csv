6401599,5,B00K2OBSI2,"Rejoice, in this drought, there's a new really satisfying film for horror junkies. How come I never heard of it when it was first released??!!! This is the kind of film I am usually hoping to catch when I surf through the morass of horror type flicks released in the new millenium. So few are of this quality. Reliable character actors, Michael Rooker and Eric Balfour, rounded out by an excellent performance by Bruce Greenwood (The Warden), the guy who played the morgue tech and the female investigator, all generated great chemistry and made it very believable and genuine. Occult, supernatural elements, combined with meaningful personal drama (as backdrop, not center stage and much of it internal), as well as a satisfying mystery that gradually unravels, render the story multidimensional and engaging throughout. The pace is good, action where there needs to be, not nonstop ""thrills"" (rare when those types of films are actually thrilling; see No One Lives, as a recent, rare recent accomplishment in that category), keeping with psychological horror, which should have meaty bone for the brain to chew on,  not just visceral thrills. The occultish, supernatural themes should indicate that some suspension of disbelief is required (not occult in the ritualistic, ceremonial sense). The beginning has a bit of  'how likely is this to happen?' but the movie addresses that by the end. Its an intelligent story, good script, meaning intelligent and appropriate dialogue. Strong atmosphere is created with a great serving of the morbid. I was ever so pleasantly surprised and I almost hate leaving such a strong endorsement, as I do not want to skew anyone's expectations going in. What its not, besides an adrenaline rush, is a film that's heavy on visuals horror effects. They are there but they do not drive the movie. The characters do. The tension is largely  interpersonal. There was one awesome scene in the morgue where they leave the visual of the end product to your imagination. That worked for me. I think it was smart, as my imagination is quite strong and I'm not sure the theatrical version would be as good. I also think that including that image would've seemed cheap and sensational given the whole that its a part of. Its also not a ground breaking film.. It doesn't try to do something novel. The movie, however, owns the story and makes the story its own. There is no derivative quality to it. Well into the film, I knew I was watching something tight, polished, and wholly actualized  according to its own nature. I didn't see any filler, wasted moments, scenes that were not fully fleshed out, or with holes. I think if you don't get into this film, its because the story isn't for you. The film itself, as a product, is solid and I have copious respect for the makers.  This is a serious movie, no irony laden, self-referential, tongue in cheeky, witty (at best) or comedic/funny (at worst) horror here.  No stock, template, no canned plot, type of film. Its not ""fun"". Its good. And I am soooo happy it got made: so 5 stars.",1406246400,12,3056,4.833652007648183
6401600,4,B00K2OBSI2,"Not only does CELL 2123 have that gritty supernatural creepy feel,...
you also get a feel for the harsh,dirty, reality of what it feels like to thrown away and experimented on by
forced psychosis ...
The mystery was there also,.. so you have to pay attention to from start to finish.
YA KNOW IT WAS ALSO KINDA DEEP!",1406073600,4,315,4.448275862068965
6401601,4,B00K2OBSI2,"Wow, what a movie I just sat through.  Now I know it's from 2008 but quite frankly it could have been made this year as it doesn't look to be 6 years old.  I've not ever heard of it but many of the actors are very recognizable and seasoned veterans at their craft.  I thoroughly enjoyed the supernatural aspect of the story and the evil that dwells in Cell 213 scared the britches off of me.  I don't want to give any of the plot away only will say that it's great to see such originality albeit several years old.  Take a chance on this one folks - I think you'll like it as well.",1405987200,5,581,4.017391304347826

6401608,4,B00K2OBSI2,"This is a revised review. As I said in the original, I'm not usually into horror so this is not my genre. I became aware of this from an Amazon recommendation. I was glad I took the rental and watched but I later watched the film again with a friend who is into this kind of movie and we talked about it. We agreed this is NOT a 'throw away' movie for any number of reasons although it could have been stronger by building in just a couple of additional elements in the script. All my issues with the film are issues of the script in the second half of the film. As originally noted, I enjoyed this movie as an evening's entertainment that made me forget to eat my popcorn due to overall creepiness and engaged my brain as much as it wanted to be engaged on that particular evening. The movie made both my friend and me jump more than once - and we both agreed the opening sequence in the prison is particularly very well done. The film is tense and kept us engaged to the end. We liked the direction and all the acting is very good. The lead is good but IMHO it's the supporting cast that lends quality to the film. What it comes down to is that we both wanted more from the script heading into the home stretch. In particular, I wanted the script to take a stand on the warden (Bruce Greenwood's character). I felt the script tried to straddle the fence there when it needed to decide whether the warden was an agent of divine justice allowing a chance for redemption or a more ambiguous agent of retaliation/revenge/retribution. It is to Greenwood's credit that he was able to work his characterization despite the script's ambiguities. (That man is just good.)  This film didn't make the most of the issues it set up but it is presented well. After two viewings it remains my opinion that if you come home from work and want to watch a movie that has adequate substance, good scares and tension, and that will let you unwind to a scary movie, this one is a fit.",1407369600,2,1965,4.3108108108108105

8655401,3,B00K2OBSI2,"This psychological thriller was moderately entertaining, and I did find it worth the price of a rental. It's not as spooky as the DVD artwork might lead you to think, but it is, again a fun movie that probably won't disappoint you if you're looking for a typical Eric Balfour b-movie.",1422057600,2,284,4.588235294117647
8655402,2,B00K2OBSI2,"the story of an attorney convicted of murdering his client and being sent to the same prison, where he is tortured psychologically and physically before being murdered. many problems with the story, first being that an experienced defense attorney is convicted and sentenced to a murder he didn't commit and said attorney, once charged, knew no experienced and competent defense attorneys to represent him. hogwash. an up and coming defense attorney would know most all the competent defense attorneys in his town, not lastly because he'd be competing with these same ladies/men to get work. so once he was charged, we should've seen him hiring someone he knew was good to represent him. also, after he's imprisoned and his past colleague and lover comes to tell him that his old law firm won't support his appeal, he drops it; no conversation with other law firms to represent him. no one with any resources would do that, he'd pursue his appeal whether his old law firm supported him or not. also, many successful defense attorneys, while not wealthy, would have money or some assets to hire an attorney. a successful defense attorney is not dirt poor and dependent on the state for defense, but even if that were the case here, this guy met with no defense attorneys while imprisoned, and that's just totally unbelievable. the story establishes this guy as a cheater and a criminal, he intended to intimidate a state witness, but his hitman actually murders the state witness and the state witness' family, yet no mention of him murdering the family is ever followed up by the state. the story is just so poorly told. also disliked the excessively alarming music which is used to keep audience frightened, when nothing much is happening on screen.

this is a story of a haunted prison cell and we see a villain go into it and crumble, what with the haunted cell, the excessively brutal prison administrator and henchman guard, as well as the threat of rape from other prisoners on the villain, it's no wonder he dies in the prison, but the story could've been so much better had it been more believably told. the prison environment seems to ring true, that was one of the film's strengths but most everything else, i.e., the murder that got the guy imprisoned, the non-appeal, the fact that we see him use none of his professional training to help himself, and the overly alarming music, all undermine the story the writer(s) tries to tell. acting is the strongest element of the film and filmmaking team shot the film well. 2 stars for acting and filmmaking effort. writer has some good ideas but doesn't bring them off as well as I would've liked. still, a writer to watch. hopefully he/she will improve over time.",1417219200,,2719,4.785106382978723
