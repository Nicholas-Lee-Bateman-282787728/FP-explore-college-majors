8741633,5,B0186O8RNI,"This is a double pack consisting of the combined efforts of WWE Studios' & WB animation to present their first ever cartoon feature movies.

SCOOBY DOO! WRESTLEMANIA MYSTERY:
This is a first in the history of WWE as it's the first animated movie under the WWE Films movie division teaming with the cartoon icon Scooby Doo & the rest of the Scooby Gang for an mystery based on their biggest annual event of WrestleMania. Various WWE personalities appear throughout the film including John Cena, Sin Cara, The Miz, Kane, Brodus Clay, Santino Marella, A.J. Lee, Triple H, Michael Cole, Mr. McMahon and other superstars & legends appearing such as Big Show, Alberto Del Rio, Sgt. Slaughter, Jerry Lawler, and Jimmy Hart.

Scooby Doo & Shaggy win a trip to playing their video game to WrestleMania in WWE City convincing Freddie & Daphne & Thelma to tag along in the Mystery Machine only for an accident allowing them to meet John Cena, his trainer Cookie, and Cookie's nephew Ruby who give them V.I.P. tickets to the show that night where Mr. McMahon makes the announcement that a new WWE Champion would be determined at WrestleMania only for Scooby to be caught on video stealing the WWE Championship Belt by WWE Executive Ms. Richards. Now the Scooby Gang only 24 hours to prove Scooby & Shaggy are innocent before they are forced to fight for their freedom in a match against Kane while dealing with various issues including a ghost bear that had been attacking & injuring ""awesome"" wrestlers in it's path including one who it has a past history with, a woodsman named Bayard who make it clear that he dislikes WWE City & anyone associated with it, Daphne developing a big crush on a certain superstar that may or may not work to their advantage, issues with Cookie about Ruby's future, and both Shaggy & Scooby showing their completely out of their league when it comes to their match against Kane.

DVD extras include a behind the scenes look at the movie along with a bonus wresting themed episode of A Pup Named Scooby Doo named ""WrestleManiacs.""

FLINTSTONES' STONE AGE SMACKDOWN
This is the second animated movie under both WB animation & WWE Studios this time teaming WWE with cartoon icons ""The Flintstones"" for their first new animated feature in 14 years featuring various WWE personalities including John Cena (John Cenastone), C.M. Punk (C.M. Punkrock), Mark Henry (Marble Henry), Rey Mysterio (Rey Mysteriopal), Daniel Bryan (Daniel Bryrock), Nikki & Bree Bella (The Boulder Twins), Mr. McMahon (Mr. McMagma), and The Undertaker (as himself).

Fred wants to take his family & The Rubbles on a vacation so asked his boss Mr. Slate for an advance but unfortunately caused an accident where they both had to be saved by the newest employee John Cenastone resulting in Slate denying the advance. Fred gets an idea later on at a charity function after Barney saved his pet from being bullied by C.M. Punkrock & Marble Henry to run a sports entertainment event recruiting Cenastone & others (Rey Mysteriopal & The Undertaker) to raise the funds for the vacation successfully only for him to get very greedy to spend the money to put together another & bigger event with his selfish attitude causing everyone to walk out on him leaving Fred alone to deal with not only putting on the show by himself but also dealing with Punkrock, Henry, and their associates The Boulder Twins with one man watching in the audience who likes the concept so much that he'll make it the biggest in the world...even if it takes 65 million years.

DVD extras include two behind the scenes look at the movie along with two bonus Flintstones episodes ""The Engagement Ring"" (Barney goes rounds with a boxing champion to earn money for Betty's gift) & ""Take Me Out To The Ball Game"" (Barney becomes a little league baseball coach while Fred becomes the umpire). Not to nitpik but to go with the wrestling theme of this movie, ""Ventriloquist Barney"" would have been a better selection for a bonus episode since that one is based around a wrestling match.

I'm not going to sit here & over analyze this movie by comparing it to the classic original Flintstones series from over 50 years ago as far as the animation being different or character voices not being an exact match or character names not being creative enough because this movie is targeted towards family & children and they really aren't going to care about that stuff when watching it together. With that being said, the only real negatives I can say is that the movie is only around 50 mins. while Daniel Bryan's role is reduced to a cameo to have a ""Daffy & Bugs"" moment with Cena when I expected more from him based off how he's heavily advertised for this movie. The positives is that the WWE superstars are captured perfectly in the Bedrock environment as far as their personalities go while still being able to have some fun with some characters such as them putting The Undertaker in situations & outfits that everyone knows we would never see his character do in his real life, Punkrock & Marble Henry had some funny chemistry together & the antics of the Flintstones characters weren't a stretch from what you would expect.

Both movies were enjoyable & fun overall combining both elements of WWE & each animated franchise together that I would recommend for the younger & family audiences of both WWE & these iconic cartoon franchises.",1448236800,,5388,4.773605150214593
