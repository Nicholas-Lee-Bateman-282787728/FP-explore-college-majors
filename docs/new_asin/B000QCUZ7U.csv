2835564,1,B000QCUZ7U,You can always count on Alpha Video to be totally inconsistent when it comes to the quality of their DVDs; some are beautiful and crystal clear... others are terrible. Romance on the Range is definitely terrible video quality. The picture is so bad it looks like it was mastered from a second generation VHS tape. I can't believe Alpha would put out such an inferior product. Don't waste your money!,1273795200,5,399,4.714285714285714
2835565,5,B000QCUZ7U,"In this good Western movie.  Roy Rogers is the foreman on the Arrowhead Ranch which is owned by Ms. Stewart (played by Linda Hayes) who lives back East.  The Overseer of her ranch is Jerome Banning (played by Edward J. Pawley) who was trusted by her deceased father.
Pawley is up to his usual bad-guy tricks in the movies by heading up a gang of thieves who steal fur pelts which are the rightful property of the ranch owner.  Ms. Stewart decides to go undercover in a visit to her ranch in an effort to determine who is responsible for the thefts.  Rogers is ahead of her, however, and is doing some investigating on his own before her arrival. When the Overseer (Edward Pawley) finds out that his foreman (Rogers) is investigating the matter, he fires Rogers after they engage in a fight.
Ms. Stewart falls for Rogers and they join forces in the investigation and finally determine that Banning (Pawley) is behind the thievery, and he is killed in the end during a shoot-out with Rogers.  As with most Western movies, the good-guy wins and the bad-guy loses!",1217203200,,1060,4.587301587301587
2835566,3,B000QCUZ7U,"Movie only runs for 53 minutes, not the listed 60 minutes.  I have bought several of the Reel Enterprises DVD's. Few have the right run time. Since I'm looking for the full length movies and the listed run time is for a full lenght movie, it does make me mad when it turns out to be a chopped up for TV movie.
The quality of the movie itself is fair to good, but they also have the RE logo in the bottom right corner.",1200268800,11,417,3.9642857142857144

2835578,4,B000QCUZ7U,"Romance of the Range, 1942 film

At night a man signals with a flashlight. There is a song around a campfire. Canoes transport stolen furs across a lake. A shot stops a rider. Others ride to investigate the shot and find Rusty, who won't talk. There is a chase at night. The thieves have a place to hide. [You can't see tracks a night.] Mr. Banning has a secret. Can he get rid of a good ranch foreman? The absentee owners are informed. Is there something funny going on? Income was halved. Miss Stewart thinks of going to investigate the situation. Her maid has a boyfriend and is given a chance to visit him. ""Gabby"" saw a truck heading up a canyon. Can they investigate? There is a chase, horses riding after a truck. Sally meets Pat. That truck gets away. A man fools Gabby and gets away.

Is it peaceful and quiet in the country? There is a conversation for comedy. The girls are warned about wild animals at night. Gabby plays a practical joke. What if a wild animal comes by? Banning is told about the problem with the truck and two girls who visited. He has words with Rogers, fires them, and orders them off the ranch. Next there is a song for entertainment. A lone rider approaches with warning. Roy and his men ride out to meet the strangers, who ride off and leave the furs. After Roy takes them the Sheriff arrives to arrest them! A frame-up. Miss Stewart tells her identity. In town Banning's men talk up the need for a lynching. Roy and his men get out of their jail cell just in time! The Sheriff and the volunteers ride after them. Miss Stewart breaks out of captivity. [The night hides the stunt double.] A shot saves the girls. They hide in the cabin used by the thieves. ""Nobody's here.""

The thieves arrive with more stolen furs and enter the hidden cave. Roy and his men drive them off, then hide from an ambush. The shooting begins. The Sheriff's men arrive. Roy talks to the Sheriff and takes him to Banning's gang, who surrenders. [Too simple a solution?] The next morning Roy goes to meet Miss Stewart. There is comic talk then another song. Bob and Sally wed. Gabby makes a joke to end the story.

Whether its the story by J. Benton Cheney or the direction by Joseph Kane, the result is a better than average Western, given its lower budget. [This version's video lacked the quality seen in othr movies.]",1404777600,,2331,4.426573426573427

8195698,1,B000QCUZ7U,"THIS IS FOR THE FILM DETECTIVE RESTORED VERSION ISSUED 1/20/2017

Not the correct running time of 63 min. , it runs 52:56 min. but the back says 63 min. It has no menu, movie starts right up. No REPUBLIC logo at the beginning, just the title and the stars. There is slight movement of the film through the movie. There are reel change marks. A few frame jumps mean missing frames. The picture stops after almost every scene change and then starts right up...like a slight pause. The picture is soft, light gray and not a lot of contrast. It cuts off a very small portion of the bottom lettering at the beginning credits, so it's probably zoomed slightly.

Stream it from Amazon, a beautiful print with Republic opening logo and running 62 min!!!
