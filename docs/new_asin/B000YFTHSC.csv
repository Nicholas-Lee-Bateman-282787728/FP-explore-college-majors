8325947,5,B000YFTHSC,"This video tells the story of the origin of the Winston Rod Company and was very enjoyable for my self as I own rods made by this company, which I use on the rivers here in Yorkshire.
I first became aware of Winston Rods many years ago, through a retailer in Derbyshire, and cannot recommend them enough.
The video took me back to those happy associations.",1388275200,,356,4.409090909090909
8325948,2,B000YFTHSC,"I was expecting an entertaining and captivating documentary about fly fishing in America narrated by Charles Kuralt in a style similar to his On the Road TV series . He makes a few introductory and closing comments and the rest is pretty much a description of the Winston company and their fly rods.  Basically, a commercial for Winston.. a highly regarded maker of  fly rods. Not what I thought it was. Interesting however...

My mistake, should have paid more attention to the  description....
