3162401,4,B0016OCTUI,"I've enjoyed the whole season and my only complaint isn't so much with what it presents but rather what it doesn't present.  We certainly made blunders and didn't have the battle experience of the Japanese in the beginning.  The quality of our torpedo's left a lot to be desired.(The controversies of the war are not shown maybe they are right.)  I wish it showed more, that generation was simply amazing far beyond our widest dreams but there was racism in their too all the foibles of man and despite it they ended it in a charitable way.  I am in awe of that generation even knowing their humanity warts and all.  Doug Johnson",1222732800,,629,4.530973451327434
3162402,5,B0016OCTUI,"Having read extensively on the ""Big E"" i have to say this dvd really opened up a new perspective on the battles of the pacific. It is one thing to read about a 300 plane raid, it is quite another to see it on screen, in real time, happening to fast to account for everyone or everything.
  This dvd is a very nice teaching aid, in particular the chapeter titled Bloody Santa Cruz. This was when we were the closest to losing all our carriers in the pacific.
  The extras are very good also, and so is the bit about how not even Bull Halsey could save the Big E from a wrecking yard.

  I look forward to more along this line from the history channel.",1221696000,,650,4.111111111111111
3162403,5,B0016OCTUI,"U.S.S. Enterprise. The only carrier that was in service before WWII which fought in almost every major carrier battle in the Pacific and survived. She epitomizes the U.S. Navy at war in the Pacific theatre during those years and yet has never really been the focus of any motion picture or docu-drama made about that subject. There have been hundreds of nautical warfare movies made and yet she never has been honored in cinema for her great acheivment.
Sadly, the ship could not even be preserved alongside the greatest hero ships of U.S. history even though some feel it's what she really deserved. But now, thanks to cgi technology, she can live again. This History channel production is one of the most watchable and involving documentaries on the carrier war in the Pacific ever made. Perhaps documentary is not a sufficient discription of this series as it is as enjoyable to view as pretty much any WWII naval action flick I've ever seen. Although it contains many actual clips of the battles it doesn't rely soley on them to tell the story. A good mix of narrative and cg really works to elevate the excitement of the real carrier war in the Pacific and the big E's life.
Of course it's not really about the ship itself as much as it is her soul which is the men who lived and fought within her to preserve our life of freedom in America. To have members of the Enterprise's actual crew on hand to tell their stories makes this series one of the best on the subject. Thank you for telling them. It should be required viewing in all our public schools history classes. Never forget Enterprise and her crew.",1221436800,,1613,4.58477508650519
3162404,2,B0016OCTUI,"First let me say that I loved the historical account related by this series: the following of the Enterprise throughout its time at war, the interviews with the veterans that served aboard her, the CGI and actual footage presentation of the battles in which she engaged.  It's a great idea for a series and I much anticipanted watching it.

However, I found the episodes difficult to watch due to the vast overuse of ""attention grabbing"" film techniques, such as periods of rapid jump cutting between short bits of film (bits of less than 1 second), which often included bits of what looked like transmission interference and those flashed numbers and letters you get when old-time films run out.  Also, the longer duration shots were often polluted with overlays of moving navigational charts.

In my opinion, these sort of techniques show a disrespect for the viewer, as if the producers can't imagine that we have an attention span sufficient to stay with a steady image.  It's just a shame that such a promising premise was related with such headache-making techniques.",1218758400,19,1073,4.972067039106145
3162405,5,B0016OCTUI,"I am a huge WW II buff, specifically the U.S.S. Enterprise.  I have read all the literature I can get my hands on, seen the shows and build models, so you can imagine my happiness when Battlefield 360 popped up.  I managed to get mine off of iTunes.

While a very well thought out show, it is very melodramatic.  If you know what actually happened during the war, the over-the-top narrator will sometimes make you cringe.  They also have a Marine 1SG on there, who really has no place at all.  He just talks about how tough he is and what it is like to be in combat, something I think the actual WWII vets are better able to describe.

While it is 98% historical accurate (with only some very small discrepancies), they often will gloss over American failures, such as the naval battles in and around Guadalcanal.  In this show, even terrible defeats are made to seem like victories!

The reason movies like Midway, Tora, Tora, Tora and Battle of Britain are so renowned, is they show both sides of the battle.  In 360, the Japanese are relegated to CGI snapshots of burning planes and ships afire.  A little more balance would have been nice.

All in all, if you aren't familiar with WWII, love the Enterprise or just like CGI-based history shows, this is a great buy and I am glad I watched it.  Nothing is perfect and I just thought I'd point out the flaws in an otherwise fantastic production.  5 stars!",1214784000,,1407,4.466666666666667
3162406,5,B0016OCTUI,"I love this show! I knew a little bit about the war but this show brings you through the major battles as if you're there with them. I was surprised how much I cared about what was happening. When you hear a teacher talk about WWII in school, it just isn't the same.
Every time the fleet got hit hard it felt like it was really happening and when we lost the Hornet I kept thinking what a horrible shame it was. I still think they should have tried harder to save Hornet!
My favorite episode is probably Truk Atoll and of course the epic battle of Leyte Gulf. The Heroic charge of the Tin Can destroyers against the Japanese Center Force was nothing less than the stuff of legends. Heroes, all of them.
  I can think of nothing other than the fighter pilots and ship gunners must have been built of courage because they didn't have the technology that we take for granted today. No Satilite survalence, No radar guided missiles, no homing torpedoes. No GPS guided bombs. No Phalanx ship defenses. You have the 5 inch gun and the 20MM and if that's not good enough, then you die.

These men were made of sterner stuff than we see today. Battles like this aren't fought anymore.",1213833600,6,1176,4.385321100917431
3162407,4,B0016OCTUI,"For content, this series has it all.  This ten-episode epic on the history of the USS Enterprise (CV-6) during WWII is an insightful, all-encompassing look at one significant thread of the Pacific campaign.  Like the Forrest Gump character, the Big E seems to be at nearly every famous and significant moment in this bloody conflict.  Of note, each episode is about 55 minutes long, so you really get your money's worth.

As for the production, it is a mixed bag.  The production in all areas is extremely similar to the History Channel's ""Dogfights"".

First, CGI is mixed liberally with historical footage, some of which may not be from the actual event referenced.  If you are not a fan of using copious amounts of CGI to tell a story, you may not enjoy this.  Note, the viewer cannot mistake the CGI for the real thing.

Second, interviews are conducted with both actual participants and modern ""experts"".  The interviews with actual participants are priceless.  The modern personnel are a bit less so.

Third, the sound production is very poor.  An over-emphasis on sound effects constantly drowns out the dialog.  This is especially offensive when it steps over the soft spoken veterans whose tales are so inspiring.  Deafening explosions are interspersed with quiet dialog, making the audio frustrating and, at times, painful.

This series could have been a bit better with a little more attention to production values.

All in all, a worthy tribute to the gallant E and her heroic crews.  I thank you for your service.  May God Bless each and every one of you.",1211932800,26,1567,4.867424242424242
3162408,4,B0016OCTUI,"I just finished watching the Battle 360 series on History HD, and can't recommend this series enough for anyone interested in the Pacific theater of WWII.  Battle 360 follows the exploits of the USS Enterprise and her crew from Pearl Harbor through the Empire's last stand involving Kamikaze attacks on the Big E.  Prior to viewing this, I had not realized that for a period of time the USS Enterprise was the ONLY operational US air craft carrier in the entire Pacific theater.  As the Enterprise was involved in a very high number of the important Pacific naval battles, it makes an excellent vehicle through which to tell the story.

What makes Battle 360 stand out is the battle sequences are depicted using CGI, so we get a view of the action as most of us have never seen before.  The CGI battle scenes are very well done.  In addition, like most History Channel series the action scenes are broken up with clips interviewing WWII survivors that served on the Enterprise as well as military historians.

I imagine I will end up purchasing more than one of these DVD sets to give as gifts to some of my history nerd friends and family members.  The only reason I didn't give this excellent series 5-stars is that after enjoying it on History HD I would have liked to see it released on Blu-ray in addition to DVD.  I doubt the DVD format can really allow the excellent CGI graphics to shine as they do in HD (though the series will undoubtedly still look very good and is very much worth purchasing).",1211760000,2,1505,4.544444444444444
3162409,5,B0016OCTUI,"I am thrilled to have this released so quickly onto DVD. It just ended on the History Channel, and three months is a good turnaround time.

I am a little biased in my anticipation, as my grandfather is one of the veteran ""stars"" of this series. (My last name is the same as his in case you are interested.) He appeared in seven of the ten episodes and, as one of the sailors who served on board Enterprise during the entire war, I couldn't be prouder of him!

Anyway, my intent was not to just review my grandfather's role in the show, as this is really a terrific series. There is a good blend of veterans and current ""field experts"" to give a variety of angles. Some of the heroics outlined truly give you chills, and the story of this amazing ship is phenomenal.

There is a ton of CGI, and this could perhaps be both the strength and weakness of the show. I know my grandfather grew weary of it and felt it was ridiculous, but at the same time it gave us re-enactments of some of the battles that would otherwise not be possible. Overall, the CGI gave a dimension to this series that really blows you out of the water (no pun intended.)

If you are a history buff, Navy buff, or WW2 buff, you should watch this show. You'll get a fantastic snapshot of a fantastic ship whose story is unequaled by any other American ship during WW2.",1210636800,42,1336,4.2896825396825395

I had always known that there had been a World War II aircraft carrier named the Enterprise, but I had no idea before watching this just how spectacular ship this was.  It was a great ship, with a great crew.  Watching this documentary gives me a new appreciation for this Aircraft carrier, and the role it played in World War II.

3162448,5,B0016OCTUI,"This DVD series must be one of the best put together documentaries of the Second World War ever to be screened, covering in detail the historical  record, the strategy and tactics, the weaponry and above all the brave men who served on the Enterprise and all the other sailors, Marines and aircraft pilots, of whom it has to be stated, were and still are the Heroes who brought Victory and peace to the world through facing danger, conflict and death risking their lives everyday to protect the Freedom we cherish. Personally I was so moved by this story, listening to the veterans' first hand accounts I was really drawn in right from the beginning where the events at Pearl Harbor were retold and the US Navy's monumental struggle to come to terms with that cowardly attack and the ensuing fight-back to take the war to the enemy and ultimately defeat and destroy them and their  Jap war machine. The computer graphics imagery used in the series is put to good use illustrating battle scenes and close up encounters which may have been impossible to show otherwise due to lack of authentic film. CGI is a bonus when used also in allowing the viewer to see dissected diagrams of all the machinery of war covering the armament, war planes and all the battle wagons that are the fighting ships.

3162477,5,B0016OCTUI,"If you want to encourage and inspire your attention distracted kids to get interested in history, maybe understand what their grandfathers did in WW II this is the DVD to start with. Battle 360 is high energy story telling all the way. The historic place that the 'Big E' has in American history is recounted accurately, skillfully and suspensefully. This is done in three ways. First, computer generated graphics show us how battles actually unfolded, how close or how far away Japanese warships lurked, how chaotic and deadly the skies over the Big E's decks were. Secondly, we see real footage from the vantage point of our fighter planes and from the deck of the carrier or it's support ships as enemy planes try to send it to the bottom of the Pacific.

Lastly, and most importantly, real sailors and pilots who were on the Enterprise are interviewed. From there own heroic perspective they relate gripping tales of courage under fire. One thing I noticed - despite the fact that there all genuine  certified, 100% grade A heroes they'll mostly talk about the actions of others, not themselves. They'll mention the bravery of a fellow pilot or sailor who performed a selfless act. Each episode breaks down key battles that Enterprise was involved in. One in particular got me hooked - ""Enterprise vs Japan."" Much has been written about the later battles in WW II, like Iwo Jima. But between the time the Navy got hammered at Pearl Harbor and the time we got our arsenal of democracy up to full production it really was Enterprise vs Japan. Wow!

The background sound effects and dramatic music made it difficult to hear the narration. The music is more fitting of a movie than a documentary.

This series has the History Channel style of fast cuts from one angle to another and quick changes of view from close-up to panorama. Snap from image to image. All very dramatic and showy...very annoying.

I agree with other reviewers who gave it 2-stars: One described what they saw as ""attention grabbing"" film techniques. Another described the use of annoying 3-2-1 flashes (like what was used in old movies at the beginning or ending of a film).

And what's with the young first sergeant that does the narratives? That helps throw credibility out the window. They should have gone with someone older...someone with experience...maybe even a WWII veteran.

3162488,5,B0016OCTUI,"I watched the series when it was first broadcast, and enjoyed it so much I decided to buy the collection when it became available. I have watched it over again at least 3 times, because I keep picking up on little facts that I missed before. This is a great product about the 'Greatest Generation' serving on the greatest ship in U.S. Navy history. A must for history buffs, and anyone who has (or had) family who served during that awful conflict, that shaped and transformed our country forever. This series is the best I've seen yet on a technical basis. They have taken the computer technology that I first saw in the 'Dogfights' series and blended it with actual combat footage and pictures from the war. In many cases the footage/pictures are of the actual incident/ships that were involved.
One of the things that was appealing about the show when it was first broadcast was the very limited commercial interruption that took place, so I thought it was appropriate that Enterprise Rental was still mentioned in the leadin of each episode. The fact that the founder of Enterprise served on that ship in the war and named his company after his ship is a perfect example of the spirit of service of those who served on her and in the war in general. It shows why the name 'Greatest Generation' is so well deserved for those men and women who pulled our country through that dark time in our history.

One footnote though, and the reason I would give it four and a half stars is due to the packaging. The steel book itself is neat, but the plastic retainers that hold the dvds in place make it nearly impossible to remove the dvd. I was truly afraid I was going to break one of the dvds getting it out, and didn't notice that one of the plastic pieces broke off for disk 3 and now the disk just sits in place and will fall out when opening the case if you are not aware.

The G4M Betty misses the Enterprise's stern deck but just skims its wooden planking with her Starboard wingtip, thereby sending the Japanese bomber cartwheeling into the Pacific in a huge splash just off the Stbd stern side...

3162501,5,B0016OCTUI,"With every episode opening with those words, ""Battle 360"" is a most excellent and very very interesting thing. In my humble opinion, this is one of the best documents on World War II ever made. It tells the unique story of an exceptionnal warship - American aircraft carrier USS ""Enterprise"", frequently also called ""The Big E"", ""The Lucky E"" or ""The Grey Ghost"".

Commissioned in 1936 USS ""Enterprise"" was the sixth carrier build by United States (hence her number code, CV-6) and the second of the very succesful ""Yorktown"" class - she was also destined to be the only survivor of the four ships of this type, as the other three (""Yorktown"", ""Hornet"" and ""Wasp"") were all lost in combat during WWII...

She had an exceptionnally eventful and dramatic career from 7 December 1941, when the Japanese started the war to 14 May 1945 when a courageous and gifted kamikaze pilot put her out of line for the remaining months of war. During this time she earned 20 battle stars (one for every battle), the most for any U.S. warship in World War II. Together with XVIII century frigate USS ""Constitution"" she is considered the most glorious and honored ship in the history of the United States Navy.
---
The series consists of 10 episodes:

1. ""Call to duty"". The attack on Pearl Harbor; ""Enterprise"" was absent from the base itself, but was approaching the island of Oahu returning from south; after loosing some planes and pilots to Japanese fighters over Pearl Harbor, ""Enterprise"" opened the score by sinking the first Japanese warship in WWII, the submarine ""I-70""; first American carrier counter-attacks in Marshall Islands, Wake and Marcus Island Raids; the Doolittle Raid - ""Enterprise"" escorted the USS ""Hornet"", which carried on the deck the B-25 bombers to be used in the raid and therefore couldn't defend herself.

2. ""Vengeance at Midway"". Pilots from USS ""Enterprise"", led by Lt. Commander Clarence W. McClusky Jr. (he ended his career as Rear-Admiral), played key role in Japanese crushing defeat; on the first day of battle they sunk Japanese carriers ""Kaga"" and ""Akagi"" (pilots from USS ""Yorktown"" sunk the ""Soryu""); on the second day, together with planes from USS ""Yorktown"", they also sunk the carrier ""Hiryu"". Sadly, this success was dearly paid, as USS ""Yorktown"" was also sunk and dozens of American pilots died in combat - and some of ""Enterprise"" men, captured by the Japanese, were tortured and murdered.

3. ""Jaws of the enemy"". The first part of Guadalcanal campaign. ""Enterprise"" pilots met there the most famous Japanese pilot of all times, the legendary fighter ace Saburo Sakai. American cruisers were mauled at the night battle of Savo Island. In the battle of Eastern Salomons USS ""Enterprise"" and USS ""Saratoga"" met for the first time the terrible Japanese twins, carriers ""Shokaku"" and ""Zuikaku"". The battle ends with American victory, but ""Enterprise"" was hit with three bombs and badly damaged. ""Shokaku"" and ""Zuikaku"" escape unscathed and they will be back.

4. ""Bloody Santa Cruz"". The second part of Guadalcanal campaign. ""Enterprise"" and ""Hornet"" met Japanese carriers again in the battle of Santa Cruz. ""Enterprise"" pilots damaged Japanese light carrier ""Zuiho"", but fighters from this ship inflicted many losses on her planes. Later ""Enterprise"" pilots damaged also heavy cruiser ""Chikuma"". However the ""Shokaku"" and ""Zuikaku"" twins, together with light carrier ""Junyo"" launched planes which destroyed the ""Hornet"" and heavily damaged ""Enterprise"", forcing the whole American force to withdraw

5. ""Enterprise versus Japan"". With ""Hornet"" and ""Wasp"" sunk and ""Saratoga"" badly damaged, USS ""Enterprise"", once repaired, was for a couple of months the ONLY American carrier in the whole Pacific to remain operational. Protected with the greatest care by a heavy screen of battleships, cruisers and destroyers she took part in the third and final part of Guadalcanal campaign.

6. ""The Grey Ghost"". In July 1943, with new aircraft carriers of ""Essex"" class finally available, ""Enterprise"" is refitted and modernized. With new guns, radars and planes she particpated then in the Gilbert Islands and Marshall Islands campaigns. During this time her pilots became the first ones in US Navy to operate and fight at night, in order to ""take the night back from the Japanese"". It was also the time of an extremely painful loss - the death of ""Enterprise"" top fighter pilot, the famous ace ""Butch"" O'Hare (Chicago airport is named after him).

7. ""Hammer of hell"". ""Enterprise"" takes part in the operation ""Hailstone"", a devastating raid of American carriers against Japanese held atoll of Truk, in which scores of Japanese planes were destroyed and about 30 transports, oilers, armed merchant cruisers and destroyers are sunk, which crippled Japanese logistics in South Pacific for months. ""Enterprise"" pilots make first night bombing raids using planes equipped with radars.

8. ""D-Day in the Pacific"". Invasion of Saipan, key position in Japanese outer defense ring. Battle of Philippine Sea, the largest carrier battle in history, ended in a great American victory, but it came with a price. ""Enterprise"" met ""Shokaku"" and ""Zuikaku"" twins again - and this time ""Shokaku"" didn't make it back home, victim of an American submarine...Excellent description of the dramatic and tragic return of American planes to their carriers, at night and with gas running low...

9. ""Battle of Leyte Gulf"". The greatest naval battle of all times, a great American victory and the end of Japanese navy as operationnal fighting force. ""Enterprise"" met ""Zuikaku"" again, as well as the light carrier ""Zuiho"" - and it was the last and final time. First appearance of kamikazes and the shock their attacks caused to Americans.

10. ""The Empire's last stand"". Raids against Japanese held Indochina and the Japanese mainland. Battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. ""Enterprise"" faces massif kamikaze attacks. First damaged by a kamikaze on 11 April, she was back into the fight after two weeks of repairs. On 14 May, near Okinawa, a young Japanese pilot, Lieutenant Shunsuke Tomiyasu, flying a Zero fighter with a 500 kg bomb, crashed into ""Enterprise"" inflicting the most grievous damage she suffered in the whole war, killing 13 and wounding 68 of her crew. Send for repairs to USA, ""Enterprise"" was still not operational when Japan surrendered.

The scenario is excellent and describes very comprehensively the amazing story of USS ""Enterprise"" and her crew. The narration is frequently made by the surviving veterans of ""Enterprise"" crew and their testimony is very very poignant. Military historians and a US Marine Sergeant in active duty provide some comment, but those series are really not much about talk - it is mostly action, action and action!

The CGI effects are very much present and they are of a very honest quality. They are also quite skillfully mixed with archive footage, some of it in colour! Ships, planes and weapons are described in simple but well done presentations. Maps are very much present and it is rather easy to understand and follow the developments.

The general tone is very ""Stars and Stripes"" (patriotic and even jingoistic), but frankly I didn't consider it an issue, as the facts are rigourously true and well presented. Also, the courage and skill of the Japanese are frequently praised with some reluctant admiration - and it is worth mentioning here (it was not included in the series) that on 14 May 1945 Lieutenant Shunsuke Tomiyasu was buried at sea by American sailors from USS ""Enterprise"" with full military ceremonial...

Bottom line, those series are a most excellent thing and I am very happy that I bought it and watched it. And I am keeping it to rewatch it again in a couple of years.",1333324800,,7744,5.091410559495666

It is fast paced, well researched and well written, and keeps you in the action, plays like an action movie. Plus there are specs and identification of WWII planes and ships, and several eye witness accounts and historian commentary. The computer graphics are amazing and compelling, you really feel like you are there more so that earlier works. It contains information that was not available, still secret, or politically incorrect to mention in earlier works such as in the ""Tigers of the Sea"", Vol 6, Wall of Fire. For instance, the Battle of Leyte Gulf, in the ""Wall of Fire"" it ""glides over"" Bull Halsey's taking the heavy carriers north, chasing a decoy while, 2,800 brave men were sacrificed in jeep carriers and other light vessels against the giant central Japanese force which saved the US Landing Force at Leyte. This account goes into detail about the brave Commanding Officer E E Evans and the USS Johnson and others for instance. There is so much, for instance, like Twidell's modification of the breathing apparatus that helped save the Enterprise at one point, and that the submarines, like the USS Nautilus (Midway), Albacore, Darter and Dace (Leyte Gulf) and the key roles they played such as in the Battle at Midway.

3162510,4,B0016OCTUI,"There's a lotta history in these DVDs - the use of CGI was really great in helping visualize some of the battle sequences, spliced in with interviews of the vets who served on the Big E as well as actual WW2 footage. 360 starts from the dark days of the Pearl Harbor, the Raid on Tokyo, then Guadalcanal, onto the road to victory.

I agree with one of the reviewers who noted the narrator uses repetitive phrases - ""spewing hot lead"" as an example. I guess there are only so many ways to say strafe or shooting at....A lot of the WW2 clips are the same ones over and over and even some of the CGI clips - I still have an image of a 500 lb bomb falling on a Japanese carrier, which is why I recommend watching this in small doses.

I did enjoy the Marine Sergeants comments - adds a bit of salt and ""hell yeah"" attitude. This is one way to get younger generations hooked on military history - it's eye candy and uses editing techniques more accustomed to video games and MTV than say PBS ""World At War"" series.

Enterprise carrier set against stunning computer generated visual graphics that take you into the heart of the battle. Cleverly choreographed scenes derived from actual living [and deceased] eye witness reports, - true-life accounts of the Enterprise's exploits and the airmen who served and fought aboard this most intrepid of WWII carriers to ever see such distinguished combat service in the Pacific ocean.

The Blu Ray version is excellent in HD, and has 'user friendly' graphics to easily help navigate your way around episodes and/or chapters in the Enterprise's history right up until her painful post-war decommissioning and eventual scrapping.

Soundtrack is only two-channel however, [left and right, - not surround] but most up-to-date HDMI equipped amplifiers will give you listenable 'incremental surround' if that's your liking. Emphasis here would be on actual period news footage, narration, interviews with surviving servicemen, aided by state of the art computer graphics or CGI, with nice textures and realism to the airplanes and ships involved.

Episode one includes stunning CGI re-enactment of a Japanese G4M 'Betty' bomber 'slicing across' Enterprise's rear deck with her stbd wingtip, - slicing off a parked Douglas Dauntless's tailplane as the rear gunner fires undauntedly at the doomed Betty as she scythes/cart-wheels into the see just off of her stern in a huge fountain of water and debris....

What those sailors accomplished was nothing short of amazing. Some of the reviewers have mentioned that the graphics weren't very good. I thought they were fine. I also thought the sound was fine. The explosions were a bit loud, but it didn't hamper the presentation for me. I'm sure the actually explosions were much louder, deafening.

If you want to gain an appreciation for the sailors who fought in the Pacific theater, this DVD set is worth your time, effort and money. Always interesting, details were given by both veterans and modern military experts. The veterans stories are particularly gripping and sometimes so intense that I was moved to tears.

I should probably add that I was in the middle of writing my historical novel, ""Class Collision,"" when I purchased this set. Although it was not the premise for the book by any means, it certainly brought the feelings home. We cannot forget what happened.

This aircraft carrier saw most for the war in the pacific by being there the major campaigns. She took major damage and delivered some too. In this series of programs I loved the genius of the computer graphics ...they are awesome. It makes you feel you are there. The producers did their homework by including details we the views may not know. They explain the ships, aircraft, guns, bombs and ammo. They give dimensions, weight and other critical information to put us right there. They intermingle the graphics with still pictures and 8mm film, to give you a real feeling of the experiences.

I knew some about the USS Enterprise before viewing this series, but now I realise she was the war effort in the pacific for the US.

I truly enjoy this series and I bet if you are a WWII buff, so will you. This is true world history so you can pass it down to your kids or grandkids too.

First and foremost, my own criticisms of The History Channel's (THC's) Battle360 and the DVD have nothing whatsoever to do with USS Enterprise (CV-6), her gallant crew, or the campaigns she was involved in. I repeat-I have only the utmost respect and admiration for this ship, her crew and the men who flew from her decks. It is for them (and their families) my heart is heavy.

As a carrier buff with particular interest in USS Enterprise and Solomon Islands campaigns I was excited with the news of THC's Battle360 project on Enterprise. I have studied Guadalcanal and Enterprise for more than forty years. Rarely if ever have I longed for an extensive and thorough series on the carrier war in the Pacific. And what a subject it is. The Big E served in every major campaign in the Pacific Theater. And I myself have interviewed a dozen Ship's Company and Air Group personnel who had served aboard Enterprise during the desperate and savage campaigns off Guadalcanal. What an opportunity to finally portray the history of the Pacific Carrier War as told via the crew of the most decorated ship in naval history. However, within minutes of the first episode I sadly realized Battle360 was merely a lackluster hack production of poor graphics, distorted film techniques, and a badly written script strewn with historical and technical inaccuracies. Ultimately, Battle360 was a missed opportunity for a thorough and honest dissertation of the true history of Enterprise and The Pacific War. In fact, within fifteen to twenty minutes into the first segment I fielded no less than a dozen calls from friends and colleagues complaining of the abysmal production style, thus confirming my own observations. (Like me, they were all looking forward to this.) Moreover, the film was so distorted I found myself standing in the middle of my living room and raving in frustration: ""Why on earth would they do that?"" As the series progressed the callers-to a man-aborted the mission entirely, most having done so by the middle of episode two. Four of these viewers had the persistence to slog through to the end of episode three and then hit the silk all together. I alone was the only one to grind through the series in its entirety. I have since watched the series two more times. And it was never easier to do so.

Admittedly, much of my criticism is based exclusively on my own production taste. The stock footage used of the Pacific War, carrier war, and USS Enterprise was shot initially in standard 4x5 full screen ratio format, which included a substantial amount of carrier footage filmed in beautiful Technicolor. Unfortunately, every single foot in the series was altered by the producers to fit the modern 16x9 widescreen ratio format. The result is a distorted ""fish eye"" or ""squatty"" effect that distorts the historical record. Though this technique is now typical, and perhaps understandable, it is hard to accept nonetheless when viewing actual film history of any given event. This problem could have been corrected simply by using a Japanese ""rising sun"" representation to one side of the screen with a partial configuration of the Stars and Stripes representation opposite. Or perhaps any ship silhouette would have done nicely, i.e. Enterprise to one side and a Japanese carrier (Chiyoda, for instance) to the other. (The Military Channel's ""Air Combat"" series, among others, used the original 4x3 stock frame placed upon a CGI aircraft skin to fill the 16x9 format, thus preventing any alteration of the original recording. It is both simplistic and brilliant.) Ultimately, it would have been better for THC's producers to zoom on the existing frame to reduce the stretched ""fish eye"" effect, even at the expense at a lost percentage of the overall frame than to have the film ruined and altered in its entirety.

Regardless, the time and effort to reduce the fish eye effect is a mute point considering that literally ALL of the film footage used throughout the series-the most accurate (and best) record to reflect the actual VISUAL combat record of USS Enterprise-was utterly made worthless by what appears to be a rotating and hindering grid of the world (hence 360?). Lord only knows what it was. This single bells and whistles affect was the predominant view throughout the entire series. As near as I can determine this was done for the sake of superfluous eye candy only. In addition, it appears much of the actual film stock-unbelievably-was INTENTIONALLY altered with scratches and ""wear lines"" to provide a rustic or worn appearance. As a historian I feel such techniques that deliberately alter the actual film record borders on sacrilege and historical abomination. And it is becoming more and more Standard Operating Procedure with THC. Instead, the visual story of the Big E in Battle360 is based upon substandard computer graphics (now standard for THC); a MAJOR disappointment when one considers actual film footage is sometimes available for specific events. Indeed, nothing can duplicate the true film record. I am not nit-picking such inaccuracies as the lack of nose or tail fuses on a CGI produced 500-pounder as it strikes Yamato. But whether we may agree or disagree with the old adage ""a picture is worth a thousand words,"" it is true. Ask any author, writer or journalist. Accordingly, when film records are available, either stills and motion picture footage it should be used. (I have viewed tons of carrier footage at the National Achieves Records Administration or Washington Navy Yard in Washington. It IS available.) And for the sake of the Enterprise crew-the subject demands it. Instead, THC chose to use poor CGI graphics while much of the history of Enterprise is available on film. Furthermore, the enemy bomb detonating near the island and the number 2 elevator, one of the most famous photographs and combat movie footage of the carrier war recorded, was never used. Not once. (You can view the entire scene on youtube [Air Attack on USS Enterprise].)

Furthermore, some may believe the ""old stock footage"" is perhaps boring and the computer imagery was new and refreshing, especially for the younger audience who know nothing of the Second World War. This indicates the primary focus was not on history or Enterprise and her crew, but the younger generation. Indeed, any objective historian or student of history cannot classify the miles of incredible color footage of USS Franklin blowing to smithereens as boring. Instead THC diminished the sacrifice of the Franklin crew with VERY shoddy and second rate computer graphics. Incredible.

But perhaps worst of all is the production's high degree of music video imagery, -i.e. fast action computer graphics coupled with altered stock footage, spliced together as millisecond film clips. The viewer is disconnected from the action, disoriented from the subject, and distracted from the storyline. While techniques such as this is perhaps accepted as entertainment by the younger music video generation, it is nauseating and overwhelming to the synapses. Neither the eye nor the ear can breathe. Indeed, at times the storyline seemed utter pandemonium; the media equivalent of trying to take a drink from a fire hose. Coincidently, this is without doubt the biggest complaint I've heard about the series from all quarters and age groups, including several Enterprise veterans, and second only to THC's ""repetitive, repetitive, repetitive, repetitive"" and monotonous post commercial break summaries. How many times did we see a CGI created unexploded bomb flying across the flight deck on March 19, 1945 strike? Over and over and over... Again, when one considers that ACTUAL film footage of this event is available and easily accessable (including several fasinating still photos of the bomb lying on the flight deck), the viewers instead were subjected to the historical interpretations of a (young?) computer graphics artist. This is simply unbelievable and would never have passed muster for the higher standards of the old History Channel.

Ultimately, I believe all these techniques were done for dramatic affect only. They provide a measurement of THC's current lack of focus on true military history and its apparent obsession with video techniques. Instead, the actual true history of the Pacific War, and Enterprise in particular, when told in a straightforward manner is dramatic enough.  Indeed, how we long for the days of spectacular, gut wrenching, historically accurate and cutting edge documentaries such as Thames Television's/producer Jeremy Isaac's multi-part series ""World At War"". These true professionals, dedicated students of history, knew that World War II combat (and film footage) was a spectacular event without the need of these rapid fire, visual eye candy, and noisy enhancements. (Ken Burns' influential masterpiece ""The Civil War"" changed the historical landscape of documentries, and he did so with still photos only.)

The interviews with Enterprise veterans, though, were most welcome to see. Any story told by these brave veterans is an addition for the historical record and a joy to watch. Yet while many of the clips were moving several of the men were limited to single and mostly insignificant sound bites owing to the producer's evident focus on useless computer graphics, =more than actual eyewitness accounts=. If for this single reason alone, reflects negatively on THC's focus on CGI. (Or at minimum the interviews were botched.) And while Parshall, Martin Morgan and other historians were informative and accurate (especially Morgan), others come up way short. I say this with all due respect...but instead of modern Marine or Naval aviators explaining the dive characteristics of a SBD Dauntless dive bomber, or the particulars of a Zero fighter, World War II carrier operations, flight operations, combat history of Enterprise or battle campaigns, other Enterprise or Pacific War scholars of the caliber of Richard Franks and Barrett Tillman should (and could) have been used. Ultimately, the best choice to explain the dive-bombing techniques of a SBD bomber were the men flying the aircraft. And quite a few from the Enterprise Air Groups are still available.

Lastly, the overall script was occasionally inaccurate, amateurish, and peppered with weak and flowery adjectives. At times it was downright embarrassing (the narrative would never have passed THC muster ten years ago). I doubt seriously that an actual military/carrier/Pacific Theater/WWII historian wrote the narrative or at minimum, proofed it before the series aired. There is no other explanation for the blatant errors throughout the series. Indeed, even a dedicated high school age student of history could easily have identified the inaccuracies with the script (I saw a 14 yr old tear the script apart before my own eyes).

What we saw in Battle360 was not history but a vast experiment in video and CGI imagery. And it didn't work. I feel for the veterans of Enterprise and the thousands of heroes from the Pacific; those who fought from Pearl Harbor to Tokyo Bay who had longed for this series. To them they are owed our best. And Enterprise/Battle360 definitely ain't it. This series should set the standard on how future documentaries should not be done.",1239148800,13,11742,5.1263707571801564
3162530,5,B0016OCTUI,"The History Channel has done a marvelous job of depicting the World War II exploits of the USS Enterprise in this highly informative and entertaining documentary.

Drawing on interviews from veterans, current military experts, and authors, this great documentary takes the viewer directly into the battle.  Actual World War II footage is combined with excellent computer animation to give this documentary an extremely unique feel.  The viewer gets all of the data on Japanese and American ships and planes, plus detailed accounts of each battle the USS Enterprise participated in.

The story begins with the attack on Pearl Harbor and continues through to the surrender of Japan.  Decisive battles such as Midway and Guadalcanal are brought to life, as are the kamikaze attacks endured by the Big E.  The Enterprise earned 20 battle stars during her illustrious career; 3 more than any other American ship managed to earn.  From the footage and testimonials included in this documentary, its easy to see why the Enterprise was such an important part of the American Big Blue Fleet.

I'm a big fan of documentaries, and this fine series is one of the best I've seen.  The computer graphics are amazing, and the testimonials from experts and survivors really enhance the viewing experience.  Documentaries used to rely on narratives and footage, but, with the aid of computer-generated animation, the viewer gets a totally new perspective on the action.

I give this fine series my highest recommendation.  The stories and footage is excellent, but the viewer will really be reeled in by the computer animation.  Highly recommended.",1232928000,,1631,5.179389312977099

3162532,5,B0016OCTUI,"The Enterprise (CV-6) was one of the three ship Yorktown-class of aircraft carriers which debuted in the late 1930's and were designed from the keel up for this purpose. It is notable that Enterprise was one of only 3 pre-war aircraft carriers that survived WWII (the others being the Saratoga (CV-3) and Ranger (CV-4) while the rest, including Enterprise' two class members (Yorktown (CV-5) and Hornet (CV-8) were sank in various battles throughout the early years of the war. Battle 360 covers the exploits of this remarkable ship, and her even more remarkable crew, and their participation of most of the great moments of the Pacific Theater of WWII.

If you have not experienced this show, then some explanation will definitely be needed. Battle 360 comes in 10 parts, Part 1 beginning with events occurring directly after the Pearl Harbor attack on December 7th, 1941 all the way up to Enterprise's untimely strike by a kamikaze at war's end off of Japan which put her out of the war's waning months. The show relies heavily upon CG animation which recreates the battles Enterprise took part in over her 3 1/2 years in theater. A narrator gives explanations for each sides moves and maneuvers, weapons and aircraft used, and describes life on board the ship. In fact, if you've seen ""Dogfights"" you'll know what to expect when you view ""Battle 360"", albeit with a focus on the ship for it's entire career, rather than with a single pilot.

Interspersed throughout the episodes are clips from surviving sailors and marines who served on board the ship, as well as commentary from current fighter pilots and historians. The show is deeply moving and you'll find yourself start crossing your fingers when you start seeing puffy ack exploding around an incoming Japanese attack. The sight of SBD Dauntlesses diving en masse with their dive brakes extended on the Japanese carriers at Midway is an amazing and thrilling sight. And this is one of the very few places you'll get to see the antiquated and doomed TBD Devastator take flight, be it in CG or archival footage, including George Gay's lone assault on the Kaga at Midway.

This is a wonderful series and I hope that they not only have a Season 2 (which would obviously have to be about either another ship or centered on a particular person) but are able to surpass what they have done here. If I have quibbles it has to do with what others have mentioned before me. Many shots used in the series are re-used repeatedly, and some are obviously pulled from ""Dogfights"" episodes (the Cactus Air Force and F6F Hellcat episodes in particular). I think it's a safe assumption that the folks who made ""Dogfights"" probably had a hand in this show as well, and this makes me glad since we'll probably not see another season of ""Dogfights"" on History Channel again anytime soon. Given that so much footage is reused you'll start to notice the same Japanese supply ship getting bombed by the same SBD every other episode, or the Akagi getting hit by another bomb on her bow every third episode. That may wear thin on some folks, and to be honest, I started to get weary of seeing the same clips over and over again. But I think this was originally mitigated by the fact that the show aired one episode a week and the producers must have gambled on viewers not being able to catch issues like this from week to week, whereas with the DVD set the reused footage is pretty blatant.

The set comes in a nicely detailed metal tin which isn't super-huge like ""Band of Brothers"", or even anywhere near the size of a ""Dogfights"" season. In fact it is only slightly wider than your average DVD case. In addition to the 10 episodes there is a small featurette highlighting certain aspects of the Enterprise, including the different defensive weapons system used on board the ship to interviews with surviving sailors. This part is more like a highlights reel in that the material contained it is already largely covered by the series itself, but more focused on small particulars. While there are no options to enable closed captioning on the DVD's (that I saw) I found that the CC worked with my TV, so if all else fails one can go that route.

This is a fantastic show and most definitely worth the purchase. If you know of any WWII buffs in your family, or have any friends into the subject, this is definitely a ""must"" for a gift. They will not be disappointed!",1231718400,2,4403,4.683462532299742

We had an opportunity to spend a Saturday afternoon with a local gentleman who was on Enterprise during WWII and he and my son really hit it off - all for the love of a ship.  I just bought two copies of this series, one for my son and one for his new friend - the WWII Vet.

Unfortunately, the DVD set is seriously flawed.  Amazon lists the aspect ration as 1.33:1 and technically that is correct.  But, just as the History Channel did with the Dogfight series, the DVDs are actually letterboxed 16:9 matted into a 4:3 frame.  Why the History Channel continues to use this outmoded format for their DVD releases is a mystery.  Even cheap direct to video DVD releases are in anamorphic format.  I can author a disc in anamorphic format on my home PC so it can't be that hard or expensive to do.

If you have an older home theater system, this set being letterboxed may not matter to you but if you have a HDTV with your DVD player connected via HDMI, it is likely that you will not be able to watch this in other than letterbox format without lowering the resolution of your system.

3162538,5,B0016OCTUI,"By now, a few of the other reviewers have shared the often held opinion that the story of USS Enterprise CV6 for a modern audience was long overdue. Unless you're a Naval history buff, chances are the story of ""The Big E"" is probably new to you, considering the replayed emphasis of other WWII stories that are so popular these days (retellings of D-Day, etc). Hollywood has somehow ignored this area. Long story short, for a Pacific Fleet reeling in the weeks after Pearl Harbor, Enterprise, her sister carriers, and a handful of cruisers and destroyers were all that stood in the way of Japanese victory. In the months, and years to come, Enterprise and her crew would fight on as a valuable weapon of democracy, and would somehow survive some of the worst battles at sea in the 20th Century.

This program is a fitting tribute to that legacy.

Notable are the dozens of interviews with Enterprise sailors, Naval Aviators, and members of her Marine Detachment, as well as the occasional inclusion of veterans from other vessels such as ""E's"" sister USS Hornet, and cruiser Northampton. Like a documentary ""Band of Brothers"" many of the veteran stories continue as recurring subplots throughout the series, a pleasant departure from other similar programs. The depictions of battles, moments of heroism, and the sadness of burials at sea are still vivid (and at times emotional) some six decades after the fact.

Of course the CGI is a signature of the episodes, at times providing a visual account of moments in battle for which there may be no archival footage. As such, the CGI can be very helpful when the blow by blow of an air attack is underway (particularly in the case of the lesser known engagements).

3162543,4,B0016OCTUI,"I loved the show and purchased the DVDs as soon as they were released and have thought long and hard about what kind of rating to give this series. I finally decided that, unlike some of the other reviewers, I simply could NOT give it 5 stars for one simple reason - am I the only one who got sick of, or even noticed, the use of some of the same graphics over and over again!?!?

For the time and care they spent/used correctly identifying the different classes of ships, both USN and IJN, and then generating the different graphics representing each different class of ship/type of plane, it is almost unforgivable that they often used the wrong one when it came time to produce each individual episode!

The most glaring example that comes to mind was the repeated use of the Hornet and Enterprise sailing together during the Doolittle raid sequence. I saw it several more times in later episodes, when every self-respecting Navy and/or military history buff knows that the Enterprise was the ONLY Yorktown class carrier left after Guadalcanal. But there it was in later episodes, those supposedly depicting 1944, another Yorktown class carrier sailing right next to ""The Lucky E"" - big as day!

Almost as bad was, during the battle of Savo island sequence, they showed the correct profile for the Vincennes (Chicago class) but, during the action scenes, they repeatedly used the graphic for the Indianapolis class, with its huge observation tower over the forward superstructure. Another glaring example, also during the first Guadalcanal episode was when they showed the same graphic for the Fleet carrier Shokaku and the Light carrier Ryujo (which didn't even have a super structure)!

I also saw several different sequences where they called, by name, another class of IJN battleship (Nagato, Fuso, etc) but always showed the Kirishima graphic from Guadalcanal, and also confused American battleship classes as well. And there were several instances, American and Japanese where they used the incorrect type of ship (and aircraft) entirely! They would mention a battleship but the graphic would be a heavy cruiser, etc.

I would say all this was simply skimping on the budget except for the fact that all the proper graphics HAD ALREADY BEEN CREATED!! So it was simply a combination of lack of respect for the subject matter and/or the (so-called) technical advisor(s) were asleep at the wheel and did not double check their reference materials before finalizing the visuals. Heck, I'm nothing more than a naval history buff but I can tell the difference between the Akagi and Kaga on sight, to say nothing of the North Carolina and the South Dakota classes!! And even my son knows the difference between a battleship and a heavy cruiser. I would have done a better job for free!!

And how many times did we have to listen to the narrator say ""The Enterprise and her sister ship Saratoga"" or ""The Enterprise and her sister ship Wasp""?!? Every Navy buff knows they were NOT sister ships!

While this may seem nit-picking to some (and don't get me wrong, I still LOVE the series and can't wait to see next season), after the care they took building the graphics in the first place, and hyping up ""the respect and dedication of the men and women of Enterprise rent-a-car"", how hard could it have been to ensure the correct graphic was being used? Once again - where were the so-called ""technical advisors""? Would the extra expense really have broken the budget?

While certainly not as bad as some movies depicting WWII Naval battles (a Korean war era Essex class with angled bow and Jets at Midway with the graphic ""USS Yorktown"", a WWII Essex class with the graphic ""IJN Akagi""?!?!? Yes the movie Midway is pretty awful if you are a history buff), it did lessen my enjoyment of the show a little.

Another thing that really got annoying after 4 or 5 episodes was the narration. After the 300th time hearing ""PULLED THE TRIGGER FILLING HIS COCKPIT WITH 50cal HOT LEAD"" I began to wonder just what it was this narrator thought he was reading for; a serious historical documentary or a videogame?

It was at this moment that I suddenly realized that this program might not even have been produced for Navy and/or history buffs!! While it was assumed we would probably tune in, I think this program was really created for the younger generation of first-person shooter videogame junkies!! The ones who think Pearl Harbor happened during the Civil war and D-Day was on July 4th. The kind that might play ""Medal of honor"" or ""Pacific Theater Of Operations"" or ""Battleship"" and get momentarily distracted by the graphics of this show while flipping through the channels on their way to the latest MTV produced sleaze-fest or wrestling program, and linger for a minute thinking it's an advertisement for a new videogame!

But I must say that these gripes did not significantly diminish my enjoyment of the show, it's still a pretty cool concept and I am looking forward to seeing what they do with the second season. It only diminished it enough to take away one star because, with more respect to the accuracy of the graphics and the narration, this would be a true 5-star product and one of the best shows ever made about the war in the Pacific during WWII.",1222819200,29,5257,4.797790055248619

3396900,5,B0016OCTUI,"U.S.S. Enterprise. The only carrier that was in service before WWII which fought in almost every major carrier battle in the Pacific and survived. She epitomizes the U.S. Navy at war in the Pacific theatre during those years and yet has never really been the focus of any motion picture or docu-drama made about that subject. There have been hundreds of nautical warfare movies made and yet she never has been honored in cinema for her great acheivment.
Sadly, the ship could not even be preserved alongside the greatest hero ships of U.S. history even though some feel it's what she really deserved. But now, thanks to cgi technology, she can live again. This History channel production is one of the most watchable and involving documentaries on the carrier war in the Pacific ever made. Perhaps documentary is not a sufficient discription of this series as it is as enjoyable to view as pretty much any WWII naval action flick I've ever seen. Although it contains many actual clips of the battles it doesn't rely soley on them to tell the story. A good mix of narrative and cg really works to elevate the excitement of the real carrier war in the Pacific and the big E's life.
Of course it's not really about the ship itself as much as it is her soul which is the men who lived and fought within her to preserve our life of freedom in America. To have members of the Enterprise's actual crew on hand to tell their stories makes this series one of the best on the subject. Thank you for telling them.

It's a great idea for a series and I much anticipanted watching it.

However, I found the episodes difficult to watch due to the vast overuse of ""attention grabbing"" film techniques, such as periods of rapid jump cutting between short bits of film (bits of less than 1 second), which often included bits of what looked like transmission interference and those flashed numbers and letters you get when old-time films run out.  Also, the longer duration shots were often polluted with overlays of moving navigational charts.

In my opinion, these sort of techniques show a disrespect for the viewer, as if the producers can't imagine that we have an attention span sufficient to stay with a steady image.

3396902,5,B0016OCTUI,"I am a huge WW II buff, specifically the U.S.S. Enterprise.  I have read all the literature I can get my hands on, seen the shows and build models, so you can imagine my happiness when Battlefield 360 popped up.  I managed to get mine off of iTunes.

While a very well thought out show, it is very melodramatic.  If you know what actually happened during the war, the over-the-top narrator will sometimes make you cringe.  They also have a Marine 1SG on there, who really has no place at all.  He just talks about how tough he is and what it is like to be in combat, something I think the actual WWII vets are better able to describe.

While it is 98% historical accurate (with only some very small discrepancies), they often will gloss over American failures, such as the naval battles in and around Guadalcanal.  In this show, even terrible defeats are made to seem like victories!

The reason movies like Midway, Tora, Tora, Tora and Battle of Britain are so renowned, is they show both sides of the battle.  In 360, the Japanese are relegated to CGI snapshots of burning planes and ships afire.  A little more balance would have been nice.

All in all, if you aren't familiar with WWII, love the Enterprise or just like CGI-based history shows, this is a great buy and I am glad I watched it.  Nothing is perfect and I just thought I'd point out the flaws in an otherwise fantastic production.  5 stars!",1214784000,,1407,4.466666666666667
3396903,5,B0016OCTUI,"I love this show! I knew a little bit about the war but this show brings you through the major battles as if you're there with them. I was surprised how much I cared about what was happening. When you hear a teacher talk about WWII in school, it just isn't the same.
Every time the fleet got hit hard it felt like it was really happening and when we lost the Hornet I kept thinking what a horrible shame it was. I still think they should have tried harder to save Hornet!
My favorite episode is probably Truk Atoll and of course the epic battle of Leyte Gulf. The Heroic charge of the Tin Can destroyers against the Japanese Center Force was nothing less than the stuff of legends. Heroes, all of them.
  I can think of nothing other than the fighter pilots and ship gunners must have been built of courage because they didn't have the technology that we take for granted today. No Satilite survalence, No radar guided missiles, no homing torpedoes. No GPS guided bombs. No Phalanx ship defenses. You have the 5 inch gun and the 20MM and if that's not good enough, then you die.

These men were made of sterner stuff than we see today. Battles like this aren't fought anymore.",1213833600,6,1176,4.385321100917431
3396904,4,B0016OCTUI,"For content, this series has it all.  This ten-episode epic on the history of the USS Enterprise (CV-6) during WWII is an insightful, all-encompassing look at one significant thread of the Pacific campaign.  Like the Forrest Gump character, the Big E seems to be at nearly every famous and significant moment in this bloody conflict.  Of note, each episode is about 55 minutes long, so you really get your money's worth.

As for the production, it is a mixed bag.  The production in all areas is extremely similar to the History Channel's ""Dogfights"".

First, CGI is mixed liberally with historical footage, some of which may not be from the actual event referenced.  If you are not a fan of using copious amounts of CGI to tell a story, you may not enjoy this.  Note, the viewer cannot mistake the CGI for the real thing.

Second, interviews are conducted with both actual participants and modern ""experts"".  The interviews with actual participants are priceless.  The modern personnel are a bit less so.

Third, the sound production is very poor.  An over-emphasis on sound effects constantly drowns out the dialog.  This is especially offensive when it steps over the soft spoken veterans whose tales are so inspiring.  Deafening explosions are interspersed with quiet dialog, making the audio frustrating and, at times, painful.

This series could have been a bit better with a little more attention to production values.

All in all, a worthy tribute to the gallant E and her heroic crews.  I thank you for your service.  May God Bless each and every one of you.",1211932800,26,1567,4.867424242424242
3396905,4,B0016OCTUI,"I just finished watching the Battle 360 series on History HD, and can't recommend this series enough for anyone interested in the Pacific theater of WWII.  Battle 360 follows the exploits of the USS Enterprise and her crew from Pearl Harbor through the Empire's last stand involving Kamikaze attacks on the Big E.  Prior to viewing this, I had not realized that for a period of time the USS Enterprise was the ONLY operational US air craft carrier in the entire Pacific theater.  As the Enterprise was involved in a very high number of the important Pacific naval battles, it makes an excellent vehicle through which to tell the story.

What makes Battle 360 stand out is the battle sequences are depicted using CGI, so we get a view of the action as most of us have never seen before.  The CGI battle scenes are very well done.  In addition, like most History Channel series the action scenes are broken up with clips interviewing WWII survivors that served on the Enterprise as well as military historians.

I imagine I will end up purchasing more than one of these DVD sets to give as gifts to some of my history nerd friends and family members.  The only reason I didn't give this excellent series 5-stars is that after enjoying it on History HD I would have liked to see it released on Blu-ray in addition to DVD.  I doubt the DVD format can really allow the excellent CGI graphics to shine as they do in HD (though the series will undoubtedly still look very good and is very much worth purchasing).",1211760000,2,1505,4.544444444444444
3396906,5,B0016OCTUI,"I am thrilled to have this released so quickly onto DVD. It just ended on the History Channel, and three months is a good turnaround time.

I am a little biased in my anticipation, as my grandfather is one of the veteran ""stars"" of this series. (My last name is the same as his in case you are interested.) He appeared in seven of the ten episodes and, as one of the sailors who served on board Enterprise during the entire war, I couldn't be prouder of him!

Anyway, my intent was not to just review my grandfather's role in the show, as this is really a terrific series. There is a good blend of veterans and current ""field experts"" to give a variety of angles. Some of the heroics outlined truly give you chills, and the story of this amazing ship is phenomenal.

There is a ton of CGI, and this could perhaps be both the strength and weakness of the show. I know my grandfather grew weary of it and felt it was ridiculous, but at the same time it gave us re-enactments of some of the battles that would otherwise not be possible. Overall, the CGI gave a dimension to this series that really blows you out of the water (no pun intended.)

If you are a history buff, Navy buff, or WW2 buff, you should watch this show. You'll get a fantastic snapshot of a fantastic ship whose story is unequaled by any other American ship during WW2.",1210636800,42,1336,4.2896825396825395

Personally I was so moved by this story, listening to the veterans' first hand accounts I was really drawn in right from the beginning where the events at Pearl Harbor were retold and the US Navy's monumental struggle to come to terms with that cowardly attack and the ensuing fight-back to take the war to the enemy and ultimately defeat and destroy them and their  Jap war machine. The computer graphics imagery used in the series is put to good use illustrating battle scenes and close up encounters which may have been impossible to show otherwise due to lack of authentic film.

3396974,5,B0016OCTUI,"If you want to encourage and inspire your attention distracted kids to get interested in history, maybe understand what their grandfathers did in WW II this is the DVD to start with. Battle 360 is high energy story telling all the way. The historic place that the 'Big E' has in American history is recounted accurately, skillfully and suspensefully. This is done in three ways. First, computer generated graphics show us how battles actually unfolded, how close or how far away Japanese warships lurked, how chaotic and deadly the skies over the Big E's decks were. Secondly, we see real footage from the vantage point of our fighter planes and from the deck of the carrier or it's support ships as enemy planes try to send it to the bottom of the Pacific.

Lastly, and most importantly, real sailors and pilots who were on the Enterprise are interviewed. From there own heroic perspective they relate gripping tales of courage under fire. One thing I noticed - despite the fact that there all genuine  certified, 100% grade A heroes they'll mostly talk about the actions of others, not themselves. They'll mention the bravery of a fellow pilot or sailor who performed a selfless act. Each episode breaks down key battles that Enterprise was involved in. One in particular got me hooked - ""Enterprise vs Japan."" Much has been written about the later battles in WW II, like Iwo Jima. But between the time the Navy got hammered at Pearl Harbor and the time we got our arsenal of democracy up to full production it really was Enterprise vs Japan. Wow!

The background sound effects and dramatic music made it difficult to hear the narration. The music is more fitting of a movie than a documentary.

This series has the History Channel style of fast cuts from one angle to another and quick changes of view from close-up to panorama. Snap from image to image. All very dramatic and showy...very annoying.

I agree with other reviewers who gave it 2-stars: One described what they saw as ""attention grabbing"" film techniques. Another described the use of annoying 3-2-1 flashes (like what was used in old movies at the beginning or ending of a film).

And what's with the young first sergeant that does the narratives? That helps throw credibility out the window. They should have gone with someone older...someone with experience...maybe even a WWII veteran.

3396985,5,B0016OCTUI,"I watched the series when it was first broadcast, and enjoyed it so much I decided to buy the collection when it became available. I have watched it over again at least 3 times, because I keep picking up on little facts that I missed before. This is a great product about the 'Greatest Generation' serving on the greatest ship in U.S. Navy history. A must for history buffs, and anyone who has (or had) family who served during that awful conflict, that shaped and transformed our country forever. This series is the best I've seen yet on a technical basis. They have taken the computer technology that I first saw in the 'Dogfights' series and blended it with actual combat footage and pictures from the war. In many cases the footage/pictures are of the actual incident/ships that were involved.
One of the things that was appealing about the show when it was first broadcast was the very limited commercial interruption that took place, so I thought it was appropriate that Enterprise Rental was still mentioned in the leadin of each episode. The fact that the founder of Enterprise served on that ship in the war and named his company after his ship is a perfect example of the spirit of service of those who served on her and in the war in general. It shows why the name 'Greatest Generation' is so well deserved for those men and women who pulled our country through that dark time in our history.

One footnote though, and the reason I would give it four and a half stars is due to the packaging. The steel book itself is neat, but the plastic retainers that hold the dvds in place make it nearly impossible to remove the dvd. I was truly afraid I was going to break one of the dvds getting it out, and didn't notice that one of the plastic pieces broke off for disk 3 and now the disk just sits in place and will fall out when opening the case if you are not aware.

In my humble opinion, this is one of the best documents on World War II ever made. It tells the unique story of an exceptionnal warship - American aircraft carrier USS ""Enterprise"", frequently also called ""The Big E"", ""The Lucky E"" or ""The Grey Ghost"".

Commissioned in 1936 USS ""Enterprise"" was the sixth carrier build by United States (hence her number code, CV-6) and the second of the very succesful ""Yorktown"" class - she was also destined to be the only survivor of the four ships of this type, as the other three (""Yorktown"", ""Hornet"" and ""Wasp"") were all lost in combat during WWII...

She had an exceptionnally eventful and dramatic career from 7 December 1941, when the Japanese started the war to 14 May 1945 when a courageous and gifted kamikaze pilot put her out of line for the remaining months of war. During this time she earned 20 battle stars (one for every battle), the most for any U.S. warship in World War II. Together with XVIII century frigate USS ""Constitution"" she is considered the most glorious and honored ship in the history of the United States Navy.
---
The series consists of 10 episodes:

1. ""Call to duty"". The attack on Pearl Harbor; ""Enterprise"" was absent from the base itself, but was approaching the island of Oahu returning from south; after loosing some planes and pilots to Japanese fighters over Pearl Harbor, ""Enterprise"" opened the score by sinking the first Japanese warship in WWII, the submarine ""I-70""; first American carrier counter-attacks in Marshall Islands, Wake and Marcus Island Raids; the Doolittle Raid - ""Enterprise"" escorted the USS ""Hornet"", which carried on the deck the B-25 bombers to be used in the raid and therefore couldn't defend herself.

2. ""Vengeance at Midway"". Pilots from USS ""Enterprise"", led by Lt. Commander Clarence W. McClusky Jr. (he ended his career as Rear-Admiral), played key role in Japanese crushing defeat; on the first day of battle they sunk Japanese carriers ""Kaga"" and ""Akagi"" (pilots from USS ""Yorktown"" sunk the ""Soryu""); on the second day, together with planes from USS ""Yorktown"", they also sunk the carrier ""Hiryu"". Sadly, this success was dearly paid, as USS ""Yorktown"" was also sunk and dozens of American pilots died in combat - and some of ""Enterprise"" men, captured by the Japanese, were tortured and murdered.

3. ""Jaws of the enemy"". The first part of Guadalcanal campaign. ""Enterprise"" pilots met there the most famous Japanese pilot of all times, the legendary fighter ace Saburo Sakai. American cruisers were mauled at the night battle of Savo Island. In the battle of Eastern Salomons USS ""Enterprise"" and USS ""Saratoga"" met for the first time the terrible Japanese twins, carriers ""Shokaku"" and ""Zuikaku"". The battle ends with American victory, but ""Enterprise"" was hit with three bombs and badly damaged. ""Shokaku"" and ""Zuikaku"" escape unscathed and they will be back.

4. ""Bloody Santa Cruz"". The second part of Guadalcanal campaign. ""Enterprise"" and ""Hornet"" met Japanese carriers again in the battle of Santa Cruz. ""Enterprise"" pilots damaged Japanese light carrier ""Zuiho"", but fighters from this ship inflicted many losses on her planes. Later ""Enterprise"" pilots damaged also heavy cruiser ""Chikuma"". However the ""Shokaku"" and ""Zuikaku"" twins, together with light carrier ""Junyo"" launched planes which destroyed the ""Hornet"" and heavily damaged ""Enterprise"", forcing the whole American force to withdraw

5. ""Enterprise versus Japan"". With ""Hornet"" and ""Wasp"" sunk and ""Saratoga"" badly damaged, USS ""Enterprise"", once repaired, was for a couple of months the ONLY American carrier in the whole Pacific to remain operational. Protected with the greatest care by a heavy screen of battleships, cruisers and destroyers she took part in the third and final part of Guadalcanal campaign.

6. ""The Grey Ghost"". In July 1943, with new aircraft carriers of ""Essex"" class finally available, ""Enterprise"" is refitted and modernized. With new guns, radars and planes she particpated then in the Gilbert Islands and Marshall Islands campaigns. During this time her pilots became the first ones in US Navy to operate and fight at night, in order to ""take the night back from the Japanese"". It was also the time of an extremely painful loss - the death of ""Enterprise"" top fighter pilot, the famous ace ""Butch"" O'Hare (Chicago airport is named after him).

7. ""Hammer of hell"". ""Enterprise"" takes part in the operation ""Hailstone"", a devastating raid of American carriers against Japanese held atoll of Truk, in which scores of Japanese planes were destroyed and about 30 transports, oilers, armed merchant cruisers and destroyers are sunk, which crippled Japanese logistics in South Pacific for months. ""Enterprise"" pilots make first night bombing raids using planes equipped with radars.

8. ""D-Day in the Pacific"". Invasion of Saipan, key position in Japanese outer defense ring. Battle of Philippine Sea, the largest carrier battle in history, ended in a great American victory, but it came with a price. ""Enterprise"" met ""Shokaku"" and ""Zuikaku"" twins again - and this time ""Shokaku"" didn't make it back home, victim of an American submarine...Excellent description of the dramatic and tragic return of American planes to their carriers, at night and with gas running low...

9. ""Battle of Leyte Gulf"". The greatest naval battle of all times, a great American victory and the end of Japanese navy as operationnal fighting force. ""Enterprise"" met ""Zuikaku"" again, as well as the light carrier ""Zuiho"" - and it was the last and final time. First appearance of kamikazes and the shock their attacks caused to Americans.

10. ""The Empire's last stand"". Raids against Japanese held Indochina and the Japanese mainland. Battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. ""Enterprise"" faces massif kamikaze attacks. First damaged by a kamikaze on 11 April, she was back into the fight after two weeks of repairs. On 14 May, near Okinawa, a young Japanese pilot, Lieutenant Shunsuke Tomiyasu, flying a Zero fighter with a 500 kg bomb, crashed into ""Enterprise"" inflicting the most grievous damage she suffered in the whole war, killing 13 and wounding 68 of her crew. Send for repairs to USA, ""Enterprise"" was still not operational when Japan surrendered.

The scenario is excellent and describes very comprehensively the amazing story of USS ""Enterprise"" and her crew. The narration is frequently made by the surviving veterans of ""Enterprise"" crew and their testimony is very very poignant. Military historians and a US Marine Sergeant in active duty provide some comment, but those series are really not much about talk - it is mostly action, action and action!

The CGI effects are very much present and they are of a very honest quality. They are also quite skillfully mixed with archive footage, some of it in colour! Ships, planes and weapons are described in simple but well done presentations. Maps are very much present and it is rather easy to understand and follow the developments.

The general tone is very ""Stars and Stripes"" (patriotic and even jingoistic), but frankly I didn't consider it an issue, as the facts are rigourously true and well presented. Also, the courage and skill of the Japanese are frequently praised with some reluctant admiration - and it is worth mentioning here (it was not included in the series) that on 14 May 1945 Lieutenant Shunsuke Tomiyasu was buried at sea by American sailors from USS ""Enterprise"" with full military ceremonial...

Bottom line, those series are a most excellent thing and I am very happy that I bought it and watched it. And I am keeping it to rewatch it again in a couple of years.",1333324800,,7744,5.091410559495666

For instance, the Battle of Leyte Gulf, in the ""Wall of Fire"" it ""glides over"" Bull Halsey's taking the heavy carriers north, chasing a decoy while, 2,800 brave men were sacrificed in jeep carriers and other light vessels against the giant central Japanese force which saved the US Landing Force at Leyte. This account goes into detail about the brave Commanding Officer E E Evans and the USS Johnson and others for instance. There is so much, for instance, like Twidell's modification of the breathing apparatus that helped save the Enterprise at one point, and that the submarines, like the USS Nautilus (Midway), Albacore, Darter and Dace (Leyte Gulf) and the key roles they played such as in the Battle at Midway.

3397007,4,B0016OCTUI,"There's a lotta history in these DVDs - the use of CGI was really great in helping visualize some of the battle sequences, spliced in with interviews of the vets who served on the Big E as well as actual WW2 footage. 360 starts from the dark days of the Pearl Harbor, the Raid on Tokyo, then Guadalcanal, onto the road to victory.

I agree with one of the reviewers who noted the narrator uses repetitive phrases - ""spewing hot lead"" as an example. I guess there are only so many ways to say strafe or shooting at....A lot of the WW2 clips are the same ones over and over and even some of the CGI clips - I still have an image of a 500 lb bomb falling on a Japanese carrier, which is why I recommend watching this in small doses.

I did enjoy the Marine Sergeants comments - adds a bit of salt and ""hell yeah"" attitude. This is one way to get younger generations hooked on military history - it's eye candy and uses editing techniques more accustomed to video games and MTV than say PBS ""World At War"" series.

Enterprise carrier set against stunning computer generated visual graphics that take you into the heart of the battle. Cleverly choreographed scenes derived from actual living [and deceased] eye witness reports, - true-life accounts of the Enterprise's exploits and the airmen who served and fought aboard this most intrepid of WWII carriers to ever see such distinguished combat service in the Pacific ocean.

The Blu Ray version is excellent in HD, and has 'user friendly' graphics to easily help navigate your way around episodes and/or chapters in the Enterprise's history right up until her painful post-war decommissioning and eventual scrapping.

Soundtrack is only two-channel however, [left and right, - not surround] but most up-to-date HDMI equipped amplifiers will give you listenable 'incremental surround' if that's your liking. Emphasis here would be on actual period news footage, narration, interviews with surviving servicemen, aided by state of the art computer graphics or CGI, with nice textures and realism to the airplanes and ships involved.

Episode one includes stunning CGI re-enactment of a Japanese G4M 'Betty' bomber 'slicing across' Enterprise's rear deck with her stbd wingtip, - slicing off a parked Douglas Dauntless's tailplane as the rear gunner fires undauntedly at the doomed Betty as she scythes/cart-wheels into the see just off of her stern in a huge fountain of water and debris....

What those sailors accomplished was nothing short of amazing. Some of the reviewers have mentioned that the graphics weren't very good. I thought they were fine. I also thought the sound was fine. The explosions were a bit loud, but it didn't hamper the presentation for me. I'm sure the actually explosions were much louder, deafening.

If you want to gain an appreciation for the sailors who fought in the Pacific theater, this DVD set is worth your time, effort and money. Always interesting, details were given by both veterans and modern military experts. The veterans stories are particularly gripping and sometimes so intense that I was moved to tears.

In this series of programs I loved the genius of the computer graphics ...they are awesome. It makes you feel you are there. The producers did their homework by including details we the views may not know. They explain the ships, aircraft, guns, bombs and ammo. They give dimensions, weight and other critical information to put us right there. They intermingle the graphics with still pictures and 8mm film, to give you a real feeling of the experiences.

I knew some about the USS Enterprise before viewing this series, but now I realise she was the war effort in the pacific for the US.

3397026,2,B0016OCTUI,"For the past few months I have noted the numerous accolades written on both The History Channel website and Amazon about this series. Yet in my circle, which is mostly middle aged historian and military types (with a few authors) I have heard only expressed disillusionment and heartfelt disappointment of a failed opportunity. Though it appears I am alone in my views in certain venues, I know for a fact through feedback that I am not. And it needs to be said.

First and foremost, my own criticisms of The History Channel's (THC's) Battle360 and the DVD have nothing whatsoever to do with USS Enterprise (CV-6), her gallant crew, or the campaigns she was involved in. I repeat-I have only the utmost respect and admiration for this ship, her crew and the men who flew from her decks. It is for them (and their families) my heart is heavy.

As a carrier buff with particular interest in USS Enterprise and Solomon Islands campaigns I was excited with the news of THC's Battle360 project on Enterprise. I have studied Guadalcanal and Enterprise for more than forty years. Rarely if ever have I longed for an extensive and thorough series on the carrier war in the Pacific. And what a subject it is. The Big E served in every major campaign in the Pacific Theater. And I myself have interviewed a dozen Ship's Company and Air Group personnel who had served aboard Enterprise during the desperate and savage campaigns off Guadalcanal. What an opportunity to finally portray the history of the Pacific Carrier War as told via the crew of the most decorated ship in naval history. However, within minutes of the first episode I sadly realized Battle360 was merely a lackluster hack production of poor graphics, distorted film techniques, and a badly written script strewn with historical and technical inaccuracies. Ultimately, Battle360 was a missed opportunity for a thorough and honest dissertation of the true history of Enterprise and The Pacific War. In fact, within fifteen to twenty minutes into the first segment I fielded no less than a dozen calls from friends and colleagues complaining of the abysmal production style, thus confirming my own observations. (Like me, they were all looking forward to this.) Moreover, the film was so distorted I found myself standing in the middle of my living room and raving in frustration: ""Why on earth would they do that?"" As the series progressed the callers-to a man-aborted the mission entirely, most having done so by the middle of episode two. Four of these viewers had the persistence to slog through to the end of episode three and then hit the silk all together. I alone was the only one to grind through the series in its entirety. I have since watched the series two more times. And it was never easier to do so.

Admittedly, much of my criticism is based exclusively on my own production taste. The stock footage used of the Pacific War, carrier war, and USS Enterprise was shot initially in standard 4x5 full screen ratio format, which included a substantial amount of carrier footage filmed in beautiful Technicolor. Unfortunately, every single foot in the series was altered by the producers to fit the modern 16x9 widescreen ratio format. The result is a distorted ""fish eye"" or ""squatty"" effect that distorts the historical record. Though this technique is now typical, and perhaps understandable, it is hard to accept nonetheless when viewing actual film history of any given event. This problem could have been corrected simply by using a Japanese ""rising sun"" representation to one side of the screen with a partial configuration of the Stars and Stripes representation opposite. Or perhaps any ship silhouette would have done nicely, i.e. Enterprise to one side and a Japanese carrier (Chiyoda, for instance) to the other. (The Military Channel's ""Air Combat"" series, among others, used the original 4x3 stock frame placed upon a CGI aircraft skin to fill the 16x9 format, thus preventing any alteration of the original recording. It is both simplistic and brilliant.) Ultimately, it would have been better for THC's producers to zoom on the existing frame to reduce the stretched ""fish eye"" effect, even at the expense at a lost percentage of the overall frame than to have the film ruined and altered in its entirety.

Regardless, the time and effort to reduce the fish eye effect is a mute point considering that literally ALL of the film footage used throughout the series-the most accurate (and best) record to reflect the actual VISUAL combat record of USS Enterprise-was utterly made worthless by what appears to be a rotating and hindering grid of the world (hence 360?). Lord only knows what it was. This single bells and whistles affect was the predominant view throughout the entire series. As near as I can determine this was done for the sake of superfluous eye candy only. In addition, it appears much of the actual film stock-unbelievably-was INTENTIONALLY altered with scratches and ""wear lines"" to provide a rustic or worn appearance. As a historian I feel such techniques that deliberately alter the actual film record borders on sacrilege and historical abomination. And it is becoming more and more Standard Operating Procedure with THC. Instead, the visual story of the Big E in Battle360 is based upon substandard computer graphics (now standard for THC); a MAJOR disappointment when one considers actual film footage is sometimes available for specific events. Indeed, nothing can duplicate the true film record. I am not nit-picking such inaccuracies as the lack of nose or tail fuses on a CGI produced 500-pounder as it strikes Yamato. But whether we may agree or disagree with the old adage ""a picture is worth a thousand words,"" it is true. Ask any author, writer or journalist. Accordingly, when film records are available, either stills and motion picture footage it should be used. (I have viewed tons of carrier footage at the National Achieves Records Administration or Washington Navy Yard in Washington. It IS available.) And for the sake of the Enterprise crew-the subject demands it. Instead, THC chose to use poor CGI graphics while much of the history of Enterprise is available on film. Furthermore, the enemy bomb detonating near the island and the number 2 elevator, one of the most famous photographs and combat movie footage of the carrier war recorded, was never used. Not once. (You can view the entire scene on youtube [Air Attack on USS Enterprise].)

Furthermore, some may believe the ""old stock footage"" is perhaps boring and the computer imagery was new and refreshing, especially for the younger audience who know nothing of the Second World War. This indicates the primary focus was not on history or Enterprise and her crew, but the younger generation. Indeed, any objective historian or student of history cannot classify the miles of incredible color footage of USS Franklin blowing to smithereens as boring. Instead THC diminished the sacrifice of the Franklin crew with VERY shoddy and second rate computer graphics. Incredible.

But perhaps worst of all is the production's high degree of music video imagery, -i.e. fast action computer graphics coupled with altered stock footage, spliced together as millisecond film clips. The viewer is disconnected from the action, disoriented from the subject, and distracted from the storyline. While techniques such as this is perhaps accepted as entertainment by the younger music video generation, it is nauseating and overwhelming to the synapses. Neither the eye nor the ear can breathe. Indeed, at times the storyline seemed utter pandemonium; the media equivalent of trying to take a drink from a fire hose. Coincidently, this is without doubt the biggest complaint I've heard about the series from all quarters and age groups, including several Enterprise veterans, and second only to THC's ""repetitive, repetitive, repetitive, repetitive"" and monotonous post commercial break summaries. How many times did we see a CGI created unexploded bomb flying across the flight deck on March 19, 1945 strike? Over and over and over... Again, when one considers that ACTUAL film footage of this event is available and easily accessable (including several fasinating still photos of the bomb lying on the flight deck), the viewers instead were subjected to the historical interpretations of a (young?) computer graphics artist. This is simply unbelievable and would never have passed muster for the higher standards of the old History Channel.

Ultimately, I believe all these techniques were done for dramatic affect only. They provide a measurement of THC's current lack of focus on true military history and its apparent obsession with video techniques. Instead, the actual true history of the Pacific War, and Enterprise in particular, when told in a straightforward manner is dramatic enough.  Indeed, how we long for the days of spectacular, gut wrenching, historically accurate and cutting edge documentaries such as Thames Television's/producer Jeremy Isaac's multi-part series ""World At War"". These true professionals, dedicated students of history, knew that World War II combat (and film footage) was a spectacular event without the need of these rapid fire, visual eye candy, and noisy enhancements. (Ken Burns' influential masterpiece ""The Civil War"" changed the historical landscape of documentries, and he did so with still photos only.)

The interviews with Enterprise veterans, though, were most welcome to see. Any story told by these brave veterans is an addition for the historical record and a joy to watch. Yet while many of the clips were moving several of the men were limited to single and mostly insignificant sound bites owing to the producer's evident focus on useless computer graphics, =more than actual eyewitness accounts=. If for this single reason alone, reflects negatively on THC's focus on CGI. (Or at minimum the interviews were botched.) And while Parshall, Martin Morgan and other historians were informative and accurate (especially Morgan), others come up way short. I say this with all due respect...but instead of modern Marine or Naval aviators explaining the dive characteristics of a SBD Dauntless dive bomber, or the particulars of a Zero fighter, World War II carrier operations, flight operations, combat history of Enterprise or battle campaigns, other Enterprise or Pacific War scholars of the caliber of Richard Franks and Barrett Tillman should (and could) have been used. Ultimately, the best choice to explain the dive-bombing techniques of a SBD bomber were the men flying the aircraft. And quite a few from the Enterprise Air Groups are still available.

Lastly, the overall script was occasionally inaccurate, amateurish, and peppered with weak and flowery adjectives. At times it was downright embarrassing (the narrative would never have passed THC muster ten years ago). I doubt seriously that an actual military/carrier/Pacific Theater/WWII historian wrote the narrative or at minimum, proofed it before the series aired. There is no other explanation for the blatant errors throughout the series. Indeed, even a dedicated high school age student of history could easily have identified the inaccuracies with the script (I saw a 14 yr old tear the script apart before my own eyes).

What we saw in Battle360 was not history but a vast experiment in video and CGI imagery. And it didn't work. I feel for the veterans of Enterprise and the thousands of heroes from the Pacific; those who fought from Pearl Harbor to Tokyo Bay who had longed for this series. To them they are owed our best. And Enterprise/Battle360 definitely ain't it. This series should set the standard on how future documentaries should not be done.",1239148800,13,11742,5.1263707571801564
3397027,5,B0016OCTUI,"The History Channel has done a marvelous job of depicting the World War II exploits of the USS Enterprise in this highly informative and entertaining documentary.

Drawing on interviews from veterans, current military experts, and authors, this great documentary takes the viewer directly into the battle.  Actual World War II footage is combined with excellent computer animation to give this documentary an extremely unique feel.  The viewer gets all of the data on Japanese and American ships and planes, plus detailed accounts of each battle the USS Enterprise participated in.

The story begins with the attack on Pearl Harbor and continues through to the surrender of Japan.  Decisive battles such as Midway and Guadalcanal are brought to life, as are the kamikaze attacks endured by the Big E.  The Enterprise earned 20 battle stars during her illustrious career; 3 more than any other American ship managed to earn.  From the footage and testimonials included in this documentary, its easy to see why the Enterprise was such an important part of the American Big Blue Fleet.

I'm a big fan of documentaries, and this fine series is one of the best I've seen.  The computer graphics are amazing, and the testimonials from experts and survivors really enhance the viewing experience.  Documentaries used to rely on narratives and footage, but, with the aid of computer-generated animation, the viewer gets a totally new perspective on the action.

I give this fine series my highest recommendation.  The stories and footage is excellent, but the viewer will really be reeled in by the computer animation.  Highly recommended.",1232928000,,1631,5.179389312977099

3397029,5,B0016OCTUI,"The Enterprise (CV-6) was one of the three ship Yorktown-class of aircraft carriers which debuted in the late 1930's and were designed from the keel up for this purpose. It is notable that Enterprise was one of only 3 pre-war aircraft carriers that survived WWII (the others being the Saratoga (CV-3) and Ranger (CV-4) while the rest, including Enterprise' two class members (Yorktown (CV-5) and Hornet (CV-8) were sank in various battles throughout the early years of the war. Battle 360 covers the exploits of this remarkable ship, and her even more remarkable crew, and their participation of most of the great moments of the Pacific Theater of WWII.

If you have not experienced this show, then some explanation will definitely be needed. Battle 360 comes in 10 parts, Part 1 beginning with events occurring directly after the Pearl Harbor attack on December 7th, 1941 all the way up to Enterprise's untimely strike by a kamikaze at war's end off of Japan which put her out of the war's waning months. The show relies heavily upon CG animation which recreates the battles Enterprise took part in over her 3 1/2 years in theater. A narrator gives explanations for each sides moves and maneuvers, weapons and aircraft used, and describes life on board the ship. In fact, if you've seen ""Dogfights"" you'll know what to expect when you view ""Battle 360"", albeit with a focus on the ship for it's entire career, rather than with a single pilot.

Interspersed throughout the episodes are clips from surviving sailors and marines who served on board the ship, as well as commentary from current fighter pilots and historians. The show is deeply moving and you'll find yourself start crossing your fingers when you start seeing puffy ack exploding around an incoming Japanese attack. The sight of SBD Dauntlesses diving en masse with their dive brakes extended on the Japanese carriers at Midway is an amazing and thrilling sight. And this is one of the very few places you'll get to see the antiquated and doomed TBD Devastator take flight, be it in CG or archival footage, including George Gay's lone assault on the Kaga at Midway.

This is a wonderful series and I hope that they not only have a Season 2 (which would obviously have to be about either another ship or centered on a particular person) but are able to surpass what they have done here. If I have quibbles it has to do with what others have mentioned before me. Many shots used in the series are re-used repeatedly, and some are obviously pulled from ""Dogfights"" episodes (the Cactus Air Force and F6F Hellcat episodes in particular). I think it's a safe assumption that the folks who made ""Dogfights"" probably had a hand in this show as well, and this makes me glad since we'll probably not see another season of ""Dogfights"" on History Channel again anytime soon. Given that so much footage is reused you'll start to notice the same Japanese supply ship getting bombed by the same SBD every other episode, or the Akagi getting hit by another bomb on her bow every third episode. That may wear thin on some folks, and to be honest, I started to get weary of seeing the same clips over and over again. But I think this was originally mitigated by the fact that the show aired one episode a week and the producers must have gambled on viewers not being able to catch issues like this from week to week, whereas with the DVD set the reused footage is pretty blatant.

The set comes in a nicely detailed metal tin which isn't super-huge like ""Band of Brothers"", or even anywhere near the size of a ""Dogfights"" season. In fact it is only slightly wider than your average DVD case. In addition to the 10 episodes there is a small featurette highlighting certain aspects of the Enterprise, including the different defensive weapons system used on board the ship to interviews with surviving sailors. This part is more like a highlights reel in that the material contained it is already largely covered by the series itself, but more focused on small particulars. While there are no options to enable closed captioning on the DVD's (that I saw) I found that the CC worked with my TV, so if all else fails one can go that route.

This is a fantastic show and most definitely worth the purchase. If you know of any WWII buffs in your family, or have any friends into the subject, this is definitely a ""must"" for a gift. They will not be disappointed!",1231718400,2,4403,4.683462532299742

He had tears in his eyes after the last episode when they scraped ""The Big E"".  He really liked the music, the action, the CGI graphics, but the best part is he retained everything he learned.  We had an opportunity to spend a Saturday afternoon with a local gentleman who was on Enterprise during WWII and he and my son really hit it off - all for the love of a ship.  I just bought two copies of this series, one for my son and one for his new friend - the WWII Vet.  For myself, I grew tired of seeing much of the same CGI and the constant music, but my son learned so much and became interested in other historical accounts of WWII that buying this is well worth the money.",1231027200,,846,4.128048780487805

Unfortunately, the DVD set is seriously flawed.  Amazon lists the aspect ration as 1.33:1 and technically that is correct.  But, just as the History Channel did with the Dogfight series, the DVDs are actually letterboxed 16:9 matted into a 4:3 frame.  Why the History Channel continues to use this outmoded format for their DVD releases is a mystery.  Even cheap direct to video DVD releases are in anamorphic format.  I can author a disc in anamorphic format on my home PC so it can't be that hard or expensive to do.

If you have an older home theater system, this set being letterboxed may not matter to you but if you have a HDTV with your DVD player connected via HDMI, it is likely that you will not be able to watch this in other than letterbox format without lowering the resolution of your system.

3397035,5,B0016OCTUI,"By now, a few of the other reviewers have shared the often held opinion that the story of USS Enterprise CV6 for a modern audience was long overdue. Unless you're a Naval history buff, chances are the story of ""The Big E"" is probably new to you, considering the replayed emphasis of other WWII stories that are so popular these days (retellings of D-Day, etc). Hollywood has somehow ignored this area. Long story short, for a Pacific Fleet reeling in the weeks after Pearl Harbor, Enterprise, her sister carriers, and a handful of cruisers and destroyers were all that stood in the way of Japanese victory. In the months, and years to come, Enterprise and her crew would fight on as a valuable weapon of democracy, and would somehow survive some of the worst battles at sea in the 20th Century.

This program is a fitting tribute to that legacy.

Notable are the dozens of interviews with Enterprise sailors, Naval Aviators, and members of her Marine Detachment, as well as the occasional inclusion of veterans from other vessels such as ""E's"" sister USS Hornet, and cruiser Northampton. Like a documentary ""Band of Brothers"" many of the veteran stories continue as recurring subplots throughout the series, a pleasant departure from other similar programs. The depictions of battles, moments of heroism, and the sadness of burials at sea are still vivid (and at times emotional) some six decades after the fact.

Of course the CGI is a signature of the episodes, at times providing a visual account of moments in battle for which there may be no archival footage. As such, the CGI can be very helpful when the blow by blow of an air attack is underway (particularly in the case of the lesser known engagements).

A great show, and a solid testament to the story of the US Navy in the Pacific War.",1228089600,2,1797,4.731629392971246

3397040,4,B0016OCTUI,"I loved the show and purchased the DVDs as soon as they were released and have thought long and hard about what kind of rating to give this series. I finally decided that, unlike some of the other reviewers, I simply could NOT give it 5 stars for one simple reason - am I the only one who got sick of, or even noticed, the use of some of the same graphics over and over again!?!?

For the time and care they spent/used correctly identifying the different classes of ships, both USN and IJN, and then generating the different graphics representing each different class of ship/type of plane, it is almost unforgivable that they often used the wrong one when it came time to produce each individual episode!

The most glaring example that comes to mind was the repeated use of the Hornet and Enterprise sailing together during the Doolittle raid sequence. I saw it several more times in later episodes, when every self-respecting Navy and/or military history buff knows that the Enterprise was the ONLY Yorktown class carrier left after Guadalcanal. But there it was in later episodes, those supposedly depicting 1944, another Yorktown class carrier sailing right next to ""The Lucky E"" - big as day!

Almost as bad was, during the battle of Savo island sequence, they showed the correct profile for the Vincennes (Chicago class) but, during the action scenes, they repeatedly used the graphic for the Indianapolis class, with its huge observation tower over the forward superstructure. Another glaring example, also during the first Guadalcanal episode was when they showed the same graphic for the Fleet carrier Shokaku and the Light carrier Ryujo (which didn't even have a super structure)!

I also saw several different sequences where they called, by name, another class of IJN battleship (Nagato, Fuso, etc) but always showed the Kirishima graphic from Guadalcanal, and also confused American battleship classes as well. And there were several instances, American and Japanese where they used the incorrect type of ship (and aircraft) entirely! They would mention a battleship but the graphic would be a heavy cruiser, etc.

I would say all this was simply skimping on the budget except for the fact that all the proper graphics HAD ALREADY BEEN CREATED!! So it was simply a combination of lack of respect for the subject matter and/or the (so-called) technical advisor(s) were asleep at the wheel and did not double check their reference materials before finalizing the visuals. Heck, I'm nothing more than a naval history buff but I can tell the difference between the Akagi and Kaga on sight, to say nothing of the North Carolina and the South Dakota classes!! And even my son knows the difference between a battleship and a heavy cruiser. I would have done a better job for free!!

And how many times did we have to listen to the narrator say ""The Enterprise and her sister ship Saratoga"" or ""The Enterprise and her sister ship Wasp""?!? Every Navy buff knows they were NOT sister ships!

While this may seem nit-picking to some (and don't get me wrong, I still LOVE the series and can't wait to see next season), after the care they took building the graphics in the first place, and hyping up ""the respect and dedication of the men and women of Enterprise rent-a-car"", how hard could it have been to ensure the correct graphic was being used? Once again - where were the so-called ""technical advisors""? Would the extra expense really have broken the budget?

While certainly not as bad as some movies depicting WWII Naval battles (a Korean war era Essex class with angled bow and Jets at Midway with the graphic ""USS Yorktown"", a WWII Essex class with the graphic ""IJN Akagi""?!?!? Yes the movie Midway is pretty awful if you are a history buff), it did lessen my enjoyment of the show a little.

Another thing that really got annoying after 4 or 5 episodes was the narration. After the 300th time hearing ""PULLED THE TRIGGER FILLING HIS COCKPIT WITH 50cal HOT LEAD"" I began to wonder just what it was this narrator thought he was reading for; a serious historical documentary or a videogame?

It was at this moment that I suddenly realized that this program might not even have been produced for Navy and/or history buffs!! While it was assumed we would probably tune in, I think this program was really created for the younger generation of first-person shooter videogame junkies!! The ones who think Pearl Harbor happened during the Civil war and D-Day was on July 4th. The kind that might play ""Medal of honor"" or ""Pacific Theater Of Operations"" or ""Battleship"" and get momentarily distracted by the graphics of this show while flipping through the channels on their way to the latest MTV produced sleaze-fest or wrestling program, and linger for a minute thinking it's an advertisement for a new videogame!

But I must say that these gripes did not significantly diminish my enjoyment of the show, it's still a pretty cool concept and I am looking forward to seeing what they do with the second season. It only diminished it enough to take away one star because, with more respect to the accuracy of the graphics and the narration, this would be a true 5-star product and one of the best shows ever made about the war in the Pacific during WWII.",1222819200,29,5257,4.797790055248619
