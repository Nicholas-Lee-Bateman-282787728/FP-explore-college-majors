8508802,3,B0072C51NA,"Power Rangers G.B. (Go-Busters) better come to north American television by 2017 , including that spygirl in pink (buster pink) who is probably the Power Rangers version of Erin Esurance from Esurance ; but , maybe rename her Nire Ancerse for legal reasons . Oh , and ToQger should become the G.B. Rangers 2nd season called Power Rangers T.Q.G.B. , I'm just sayin . This way , when and if Buster Silver/Beat J Stag gets destroyed in the season finale of Power Rangers G.B. , this former insurance agent can replace him as the 5th member and become the T.Q.G.B. Pink Ranger .",1396224000,,574,4.58252427184466
