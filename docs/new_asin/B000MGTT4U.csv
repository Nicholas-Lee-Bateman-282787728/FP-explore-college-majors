2736177,5,B000MGTT4U,"The DVD is indexed so you can easily find the demonstration of whatever technique you need.  You could also do what I do sometimes:  Hit ""play all,"" pick up the needles, and knit while EZ and MS explain it all.  It's like knitting with your Grandma!",1225065600,8,249,4.369565217391305
2736178,1,B000MGTT4U,They go way too fast when showing a type of stitch. I'm not a beginner or an expert but bought this CD to learn differnt types of cast ons ect. Good luck if you can figure out what their doing. Not for beginners.,1213574400,8,212,3.953488372093023
2736179,5,B000MGTT4U,"A knitting Glossary by Elizabeth Zimmermann is a DVD that has clips showing individual techniques catalogued alphabetically. It is the DVD you will want to stick in to watch when you are stuck in a pattern and can't figure out what that pattern stitch is supposed to be. The DVD is user friendly, clear photos of technique(s) are shown that can be watched as often as necessary to learn the stitch. This is NOT a how-to-knit DVD, rather it is wonderful to have in addition to E.

2736180,4,B000MGTT4U,This is great fun for any EZ fan. It is not slick or wonderfully  produced but still great fun. Very down to earth and filled with great tips and help.,1205107200,3,151,4.033333333333333
2736181,5,B000MGTT4U,"This is one of the best of the Schoolhouse Press DVD's featuring Meg Swansen and Elizabeth Zimmermann discussing knitting techniques. The whole format is relaxed and although sometimes it is a little difficult to follow what they are saying - and there are no subtitles (which would benefit me as I am severely hard of hearing) - the close-up filming of the hands working the knitting and demonstrating what to do are excellent.

I particularly love the section demonstrating how to fix a mistake in a cable by dropping stitches and re-knitting the cable instead of taking out several rows of work. I also adore the demonstrations of I-cord techniques and the huge collection of methods of casting on is incredible. The DVD is fully indexed, so it is possible to select any section you wish to watch, or you can just watch it straight through. Either way it's very entertaining and enjoyable.

This is a must for any knitter, particularly if you wish to take the Knitting Masters course.",1202169600,37,987,4.8
2736182,5,B000MGTT4U,"If you don't have time to take classes, you have it all right here alive and in color with Elizabeth and Meg.  You feel as tho' you are right there on their couch learning from two experts.  Elizabeth's demeanor and humor are just so endearing. I adore her and Meg's wit. The beauty of the DVD is you have the ability to pause,go back and search through an expansive and thorough index. If you are knitting and come to a road block, you will find your answer on this DVD. I absolutly love this DVD.  You will not be disappointed.  This is a timeless tool for anyone who knits.",1185408000,41,576,4.256880733944954
2736183,5,B000MGTT4U,"This DVD was extremely helpful to me as a self-taught knitter who began with socks several months ago.  The comfortable format of a mother and daughter sitting on a sofa discussing knitting and demonstrating various techniques was most useful.  It is a joy to watch on so many levels.  I love Elizabeth Zimmermann's spirit and her daughter, Meg Swansen's expertise.  The well organized index allows easy access to the various techniques for later review.  This DVD is jam packed with information as it's very tightly edited and includes a wonderful interview at the end.  I HIGHLY recommend this video to new and experienced knitter's alike.  I also bought the Knitting Workship DVD, but of the two, the Knitting Glossary is the most helpful.",1173484800,73,742,4.983739837398374
2736184,5,B000MGTT4U,This DVD walks you through all of the knitting techniques you will need.  And what a joy to see Elizabeth and Meg knitting together.,1170892800,18,132,4.5
2736185,4,B000MGTT4U,"I have known about Elizabeth Zimmerman for many years, but this is the first item of hers that I have purchased.  I look forward to enjoying each and every one of her items.  They have been on the market for a very long time, so they are very popular.  Glad to add them to my knitting library.",1381449600,,293,4.105263157894737
2736186,5,B000MGTT4U,"I was new to knitting when I ordered this DVD. I'd taught myself the basics and I was looking for something to improve my skills and confidence. This DVD is brilliant, together with other Zimmermann products. I have the confidence now to make my own creations and I often go back to this DVD to check this technique or that...",1371340800,,326,4.45
2736187,5,B000MGTT4U,This DVD is a user friendly teacher for knitting techniques from beginning through experienced knitting.  The background music is lovely and the video technique makes good use of close-up work and highlights two great communicators of knitting artistry.  Each indexed technique is covered concisely and is easy to review instantly.,1363305600,,331,5.6
2736188,5,B000MGTT4U,"Thirty years ago, while studying textiles, my teacher and mentor encouraged me to learn to knit. I found it a difficult challenge as I learn hand skills best visually. Recently, a parishioner with limited English heard that I weave and, thinking that meant that I knit, she approached me to ask her to solve a problem, since she could not follow written English instructions. This lady, from Bosnia, seems to be able to learn anything visually. So I gave her this DVD, which I watched first. It solved some of my old problems. It certainly helped her. A couple of days later she came by with the first part of a layette finished. I think any knitter who is afraid of the unfamiliar will find this useful.",1362960000,2,704,4.551181102362205
2736189,2,B000MGTT4U,I feel that this DVD is definately NOT for newer knitters. The explanations were not clear and the demonstrations were done quickly. I would like to return it.,1362096000,2,159,4.714285714285714
2736190,5,B000MGTT4U,"I bought this DVD for my sister as a gift.  She enjoys it, watches often, and talks about learning something new and valuable each time she watches it.  As the giver of a gift that I hoped would be a wonderful gift, I am fantastically pleased.  I'm not a knitter. I am an admirer of knitters! My sense is that this DVD is an excellent resource for knitters advancing in their art, who want to explore and learn new technique, and apply it to their own styles of knitting.",1310169600,2,471,4.269662921348314
2736191,5,B000MGTT4U,"If you are an EZ fan, you will like having this DVD in your knitting library.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Knitting-Glossary-DVD/dp/B000MGTT4U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Knitting Glossary DVD</a>",1309910400,,239,9.909090909090908
2736192,5,B000MGTT4U,"This DVD is so worth the price because you see the actual technique being knitted.  I personally consider it one of the essentials for a knitting library.  I bought it for myself some time ago and it sat forgotten on my reference shelf until I wanted to review it to see if it would be good for a new knitter friend of mine.  And that's when I found how comprehensive it was.  It even demonstrated Channel Island cast-on that I'd been struggling with from photos in a pattern book.  I bought another one for my friend for a 2009 Winter gift and I'm sure she'll find it just as helpful on those frigid NY winter nights when one nestles into a comfy chair, starts those knitting needles clicking--then comes across a pattern stitch she's never heard of before.  EZ (and Meg) to the rescue once again.",1260230400,10,798,4.431506849315069
2736193,5,B000MGTT4U,An amaizing DVD. I find Elizabeths DVD easier to follow than her knitting books. Great techniques with lots of variety.,1246665600,6,119,5.0
2736194,4,B000MGTT4U,I am late in discovering the value of Elizabeth Zimmerman's teaching.  She has made a wonderful contribution to the art of knitting and this book is just one example.  I am very pleaed to own this book!,1240099200,3,202,4.4324324324324325

8169283,5,B000MGTT4U,"A most helpful knitting video. Well organized so it makes it easy to access that one technique you need, or you can just hit play and let the knitting happen. It's like TechKnitting with your grandmother and favorite aunt. Meg has updated it since the original, adding segments of things she's learned along the way, but it flows smoothly in that wonderfully amateurish way that Schoolhouse Press productions do. Meg has also included an interview of herself about the making of the original, which is adorable. The whole thing from start to finish is not only informative but completely and utterly charming. As watching Meg and Elizabeth knit always is.",1456272000,2,655,4.963636363636364
8169284,5,B000MGTT4U,Tons of info. I enjoy learning this way.,1440979200,,40,4.125
8169285,1,B000MGTT4U,"Dreadfully disappointed with this!  Quality is appalling , the soundtrack is mostly non existent and very amateur editing.  I have seen better quality movies made in the 1920's.  I gave up after an hour of immense concentration and frustration.  Total waste of $40 plus postage.  It should be illegal to sell something like this when it has been grossly misrepresented to buyers.",1433376000,,379,5.048387096774194
8169286,5,B000MGTT4U,"Love this DVD!  It's not professionally shot but contains a wealth of information for any knitter, at any stage in this craft.  Also, its not easy to find on DVD.  A true hidden gem:)!",1425427200,,184,4.352941176470588
