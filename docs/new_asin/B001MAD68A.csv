8320779,5,B001MAD68A,"This is a gem of a documentary.  It is very well told, and tells the beautiful story of healing in a very troubled place.  The central figure, Golden Kilburn, proves the ancient American saying, ""Perfect love casteth out all fear.""  It kills me that Deseret Book removed this gem from its stores simply because it did not sell well. They should have PROMOTED it.",1385424000,,362,4.625
