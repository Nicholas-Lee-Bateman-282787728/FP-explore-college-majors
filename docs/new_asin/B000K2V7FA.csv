8154075,4,B000K2V7FA,"Both LIFE WITH FATHER and FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND have been in the public domain since the beginning of the home video era. Unless they're original studio releases, most DVD manufacturers issue these in unrestored form, often from well-used 16 mm stock or even copies of previous videotapes. If pristine image is not critical, these budget-priced discs are adequate. With rare exception, bonus features are non-existent and in the case of classic era movies, full screen format is the rule.

Michael Curtiz's LIFE WITH FATHER is based on a memoir written by Clarence Day Jr. and on the Lindsay/Crouse stageplay. This fin de si&egrave;cle tale concerns the domestic adventures of a somewhat uptight businessman (Powell), his slightly neurotic wife (Dunne) and their four mischievous children.

Vincente Minnelli's comedy, FATHER'S LITTLE DIVIDEND is the sequel to BRINGING UP FATHER. Here, Stanley Banks (Tracy) has trouble coping with the idea that he'll soon be a grandfather.
