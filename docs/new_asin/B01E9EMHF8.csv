I bought two of the 10 minutes solution workouts and I really like them.",1293926400,4,249,4.020408163265306
7733501,5,B01E9EMHF8,"A fun workout that is challenging and not boring.  As an intermediate level exerciser, doing two workouts back to back makes you develop a light sweat.  All three have a nice 2 minute warmup and 2 minutes cool down.",1292803200,7,215,4.487179487179487
7733502,5,B01E9EMHF8,"Denise Austin's ""SHRINK YOUR FAT ZONES PILATES""  is a wonderful pilates workout dvd.
It consists of 3 workouts broken up in zones for 21 days to trim and slim.
ZONE1 (15 mins);
This workout is for abs & core. It works the abs from every angle and you WILL feel your muscles work.
ZONE2 (15 mins);
This workout is for the upper body. It works the shoulders,chest and arms. You will need Weights for this workout.
ZONE3 (15 mins);
This workout is for the buns and thighs. You will need a towel for this workout.

Denise Austin shows that she knows her stuff in this workout,using her background exercisers to demonstrate correct technique and informs the viewer on the muscles/body parts being exercised.

Don't worry if you are not very flexible,this dvd is for everyone:-)",1292630400,104,772,4.703703703703703

8758098,5,B01E9EMHF8,"Love this workout.  There are 3 ten minute segments.  You can choose any segment or all 3 and once you know the routine you are able to turn off the instructions.  I find the workout is effective...Not too easy, but not too strenuous either. I have to other Pilates DVDs and this is my favorite",1536624000,,294,4.3090909090909095

8758100,4,B01E9EMHF8,"Overall, I like this video.  I have some balance issues that made some of the exercises impossible, but I can still use it.  Denise Austin puts out a good product, and just seems like a nice person.",1527897600,,198,4.324324324324325
8758101,2,B01E9EMHF8,"I'm 47 yrs. old and I would say I'm a little above average for my age in the fitness department.  I bought this dvd based on other reviews but I was pretty disappointed.  I thought it was too easy.  There were a few moves that I really liked a lot, but she doesn't spend enough time on each move.  She only does a particular move a couple times on each side so you don't get a chance to feel the burn.  One reviewer complained about her voice.  I'm not one to criticize something like that, but I have to agree.  It was very ""cheerleader-ish"".  Don't buy if you're in decent shape.",1524441600,,581,4.171171171171171
8758102,5,B01E9EMHF8,"I love Denise Austin and miss not seeing her on her  morning exercise show on TV, as she used to be.  This video is great and a replacement for me and inspiration to exercise with her every morning.  It is a well balanced exercise program, and she clearly presents all the movements and always is inspiring!",1524182400,,307,4.446428571428571
