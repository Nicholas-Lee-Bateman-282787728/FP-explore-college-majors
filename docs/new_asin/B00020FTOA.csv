8019418,1,B00020FTOA,"So you're a fan of vampire movies? Dark castles, lusty, busty wenches with occasional necking, right?
But before you watch this movie, let me offer the following suggestion for your consideration.
Go out to your garage. Open your tool box. Take out a large pair of pliars, preferably channel locks.
Next, go to your bathroom. Turn on the light, and face the mirror. Select any tooth at random. Using the large pliers, remove said tooth.
Trust me, it will be less painful than watching this Movie. And you'll still be smiling!",1505174400,,525,4.78021978021978

8019420,3,B00020FTOA,"I swear. after buying and watching this movie (many, many times) i have come to the conclusion that it is infinitely better than Viagra or Extenze. I literally have never lost my erection since viewing it. Guys. Get it. Your girls will love it.",1346025600,,244,4.568181818181818
8019421,2,B00020FTOA,"This is an awfull movie!!  So much fun to watch, although you'll be shaking your head and yelling ""What????"".",1196380800,,109,4.7368421052631575
8019422,1,B00020FTOA,"I don't know what movie the other reviewers saw, but it can't be the same one?  There are so many editing bloops that it reminds me of Ray Harryhausen's stop motion animation.

Bruce Glover (who played one of the gay killers in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER) tries to inject Leslie Nielsen like humor in his inept Dr. Van Helsing, but it just isn't funny.  It's all bee done before and much better.

Denny Sachen as the studly Stephen has the emotional range of a rutabaga; Kerry Dustin as Carla radiates a quiet sensuality but given the role she plays, it is useless.  The rest of the cast, who also have a lot of no talent, merely add bodies.  Some of the effects are okay, but again been there done that much better.  While the photography is beautiful and captures the atmosphere of Moravia and what-not, this movie is really bad.  The three actors who play Dracula have got to be three of the most repulsive looking things I've seen on screen.

Good idea, horrible execution.",1092355200,3,971,4.5344827586206895
8019423,3,B00020FTOA,An awful attempt at making a modern dracula horror movie. Extremely poor picture and sound quality.  The sound is slightly out of sinc with the mouths of the people and it sounds like the mics were bad anyway.  It is hilarious to watch anyway!  I give it 3 stars because I love B movies and this one will be awsome to show your friends to see their reactions.,1087516800,4,359,4.25
8019424,4,B00020FTOA,"After losing his girlfriend in a terrible accident, Steve Hillerman (Denny Sachen) moves to a small town that happens to have a vampire outbreak. He  teams up with Van Helsing (Bruce Glover)to rid the legendary problem - -  Dracula (Ernest Garcia). But, the best laid plans often play into a very  good comedy horror. Great film for Halloween.",967248000,2,343,4.879310344827586
