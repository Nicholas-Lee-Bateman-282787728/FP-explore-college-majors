1248810,4,B000021Y7H,"''L'&Eacute;cole de la chair"" (School of Flesh), a candidly modern take on the search for intimacy, is the basis for a sensuous, sexy, and painfully passionate love affair between an older woman and a younger man. Dominique (Isabelle Huppert), a career-minded, well-off older woman meets Quentin (Vincent Martinez), a young street hustler with a mysterious background. From the start, and in spite of herself, Dominique responds to Quentin's obvious signs of interest, and they strike up a ''deal'': an affair, with no strings attached. Watch as these two beautifully sad beings duel for control and fight to entrap one another. Do they have a chance at love? I'll never tell!  A subtle yet powerful movie, with characters you'll not soon forget. Quintessentially French in many ways, this is a fabulous dramatization of Yukio Mishima's Japanese novel (roughly translated as ''School of Love''), adapted to modern-day France.  ''The School of Flesh'' will not be liked by everyone, of course, but if you're looking for a quiet, painstaking anatomy of the intricacies of heterosexual love, especially of the May-December variety, this is the movie for you.

This is a difficult DVD to locate, however. For films that explore a similar topic with various settings and characters, check out: Indochine, Un Coeur en hiver (A Heart in Winter), Nettoyage &agrave; sec (Dry Cleaning), Entre nous (also with Isabelle Huppert).",980553600,19,1418,5.265486725663717
1248811,5,B000021Y7H,"Largely ignored during it's theatrical release, Benoit Jacuot's absorbing Paris soap-opera is well worth the watch. Based upon a story by Mishima, this enveloping, frequently erotic, melodrama introduces Dominique, a seemingly aloof Paris fashion executive who falls for the charms of Quentin, a youthful bisexual prostitute who may or may not be playing Huppert for all she's worth.
Always unpredictable, and with a conclusion that's both adult and satisfying, the film is also a prime showcase for actress Isabelle Huppert, who's surely reaching a new and glorious peak. As Dominique, Huppert is remarkably distilled, not a move is wasted; a simple glance, or the casual flick of her wrist, is all it takes to pull you in. Vincent Lindon, as the kickboxing prostitute, surely looks the part, and he plays well against Huppert in several heated and emotionally revealing lovemaking scenes.
In many ways, given it's hushed tones and it's imminent threat of erotic danger, ""School of Flesh"" works even better on the home screen.",971827200,8,1027,5.2303030303030305
1248812,5,B000021Y7H,"Isabelle Huppert and Vincent Martinez are superbly cast as victims of co-dependence.  School of Flesh inverts the older-man young-woman theme and flavors it with contemporary nuances.  Here we have an affluent older woman  who gets off on the power money afford her, and a younger ambitious young  man who prostitutes himself in more ways than one.  This is no doubt a  moral tale, though thankfully the director allows the viewer to make up his  own mind about who abuses and who is abused, who is good and who is bad.  The final scene is devastating, perhaps the best I've seen of films in this  genre.  Also, Isabelle Huppert is stunning--you may fall in love with her.",962668800,17,672,4.7155172413793105
1248813,5,B000021Y7H,"A beautifully crafted film. Isabelle Huppert's acting is stunning. Her tears seem so authentic and she is given a strong, 3-dimensional role in this one. The wonderful story of a relationship between a bisexual  prostitute and a more mature woman. Was it doomed to fail? Probably. But  was it real? Yep. A good film to get lost in.",962496000,11,331,4.689655172413793
1248814,3,B000021Y7H,"I enjoyed this film!  An older woman falls for the passionate eyes of a young bartender.  She becomes a prisoner of her desires for his love. The aloof, yet caring and secretive persona of the young gentleman only adds to  the anquish she experiences as love emotionally tears at their identities.  The plot has interesting twists and turns.  A good departure from  hollywood.",945820800,11,376,4.888888888888889

1248869,5,B000021Y7H,"**Spoiler Alert**

Isabelle Huppert plays Dominique, a rich, educated, career woman. One night she meets Quentin, played by Vincent Martinez. Quentin isn't exactly a hustler-more of a bi-sexual rent boy. Quentin and Dominique get on in a curious way. Dominique is icy cold and seems more than happy with a casual arrangement. Quentin is young and needs entertainments all over town. But as Dominique delves into Quentin's life she discovers she feels both a parental protection and lovers attachment. Quentin courts Dominique's best friend's daughter and announces his intention to wed. Furious, Dominique obtains compromising photographs of Quentin. When Quentin asks ""Aren't I entitled to a normal life?"", Dominique acquieses. Then Quentin decides he doesn't want to walk away if Dominique is willing to let him go. Dominique pushes him out of the nest anyway but years later discovers that Quentin's ""normal"" life wasn't the dream he had anticipated. Their ""unnormal"" love was actually fulfilling in comparison and probably something they should have held on to.

The French are so...inventive when it comes to relationships. Their love stories never cease to intrique me. They're so realistic and cynical when it comes to love that they have no problems with completely letting go and letting love rule their lives. The School of Flesh is based on gay Japanese authour Yukio Mishima's short story by the same name, but the French have aptly adapted it to express their cultural take on love. (The School of Flesh was never translated into english and therefore not available on amazon.)

This is the third film I've seen with Isabelle Huppert and she has grown on me to the point of adoration. Her characters are always icy cold and able to handle eveything and she plays the parts to perfection. I highly recommend watching her in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Story-of-Women/dp/B00026L7N6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Story of Women</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Piano-Teacher-Unrated-Edition/dp/B00006LPER/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Piano Teacher (Unrated Edition)</a>.",1243728000,5,2185,5.996794871794871

At times I was left wondering if I missed some important key to what was happening, but when I backed up and watched closely, there was nothing there.

If there were sex scenes that might explain the title of the movie, they have been edited out in the Amazon Prime version.",1457049600,,483,4.488636363636363
