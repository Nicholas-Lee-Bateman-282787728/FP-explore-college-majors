8324515,5,630159391X,"I first saw this movie on USA, back when the network used often risque ""B"" fodder to fill the late night time slot on Fridays and Saturdays. (Remember ""Up All Night?"") James Davies plays a nerdy teen working in an antiques store who is given three wishes by a scantily clad female genie.  If I recall correctly, he desires true love but is rebuffed by a series of comedically unfit women.  In the end, however, he finds happiness with his equally nerdy coworker.

Given the premise, and the fact that Chuck Vincent (the director) used to be involved in porn, I am not surprised that ""Wildest Dreams"" received no Academy awards, but all the same I found the story charming and romantic in a naive way, as well as very funny.  Just as in ""Nadja"" surrealist poet Andre Breton observed the wonders that abounded in deceivingly second rate plays and serials,  the marvelous is a constant in this unjustly ignored production that is definitely worth a look.",1102204800,5,951,4.6706586826347305
