2372669,3,B000A6T22Q,"Out of all the stars from ""Saturday Night Live"", perhaps the one whose star shined brightest was Gilda Radner. Often regarded as the greatest cast member the show ever had, Gilda proved to be the standout of the cast from the first five years. Her wide range of zany charatcers and a pension for pyschical comedy not seen in any comedienne since Lucille Ball made her one of the most beloved female comics ever. Ever since Broadway Video started releasing best - of dvd's for ""SNL"" cast members for the show's 25th anniversary, many longtime fans begged for a ""Best Of Gilda Rdaner"" dvd to be relased. On Seotember 6th, 2005, those fans finally got their wish. How is it? Read on.

Well, to be honest, I was a little disappointed in this dvd. It's no secret that Gilda did some of the most hilarious sketches in ""SNL"" history, most of the time portraying her own original characters. However, I felt this dvd doesn't do her justice. It is apparent that the compilers aimed this dvd at younger ""SNL"" fans as a sampler of some of Gilda's best work, so a newer generation might embrace her legacy. Great idea, but I honestly think that they should have also kept the hardcore fans who've longed for her best stuff in mind as well when this dvd was made.

To get diehards to buy it, the compilers put most of Gilda's most famous popular recurring characters on the dvd, such as Emily Litella, Roseanne Rosanndanna, Baba Wawa and Lisa Loopner. However, for the most part, I wouldn't say they picked the best editions of these sketches for the dvd. They are all indeed very funny, but I can't help but feeling that they're better appearances of these characters. Other sketches, such as ""Slumber Party"" and ""Candy Slice"", do indeed have many amusing moments, but sooner or later the viewer loses interest. Also, when I finished watching the dvd, I couldn't help but notice that quite a few of her recurring characters were missing, such as Bobbi Farber, Jenny Rocker, Colleen Fernman, Debbie Doody, Connie Carson and many others. There were even a few sketches on this dvd that didn't do anything for me at all. On the plus side, we finally get the ""Dancing In The Dark"" sketch on dvd. Thst skit was woefully missed from ""The Best Of Steve Martin"".

I haven't watched the extras yet, but I'm sure that they'll at least be decent. Udually, the ""SNL"" dvds have great extras. I do recommend this dvd to most Gilda fans but advise them to keep in mind that a lot of her best stuff is indeed missing.",1126224000,53,2489,4.563758389261745
2372670,5,B000A6T22Q,"I've watched a few other SNL ""Best of"" compilations over the years and this is by far the best.  It is presented on a single-sided double-layer disc and features many classic Gilda skits, as well as great extras, making it well worth the long wait.  The quality is pretty good, considering the source material is between 25 and 30 years old.  The TV interviews and the ""Inside Look"" featurette also show excerpts from other skits not presented on this DVD, making one hope there will eventually be a volume 2.

The total running time of the main feature is 1 hour 32 mins. and include the following:
-Disclaimer: Cousteau

-Nerd Prom
-Jewess Jeans
-Not For Ladies Only

But for more casual fans, this DVD is good, but there should have been a few more Roseanne Roseannadanna appearances included. (Her commentary on red meat/fish (April 1979) is probably the best one, also the dentist visit (Feb 1978) is hysterical!)
The VHS video included the funny Harleys Bristol Crme skit with Bill Murray which is not on the DVD now.

Hardly any of her Lisa Loopner, Roseanne Roseannadanna or Emily Litella characters were included.

While Bill Murray and a couple of others have certainly had more distinguished careers overall, she was by far the best *on the show*--and, while Bobbi Farber is certainly missed here, and a few sketches are lame (the Jackie O weight lifting thing? The Nadia Comenici thing? Really?), this disc gives a strong overview--from her almost frighteningly real little girls to Roseanne Roseannadanna...nobody else comes close.",1278892800,,461,5.243243243243243

It was wonderful to see her ""Best of"" - watching how she didn't care about looking ""feminine"" or sexy or anything like that.  She went for the laugh- whatever it took.  One minute she could be dancing with Steve Martin in a serious dance - and in another segment, she can be Roseanne RoseannaDanna - sticking things up her nose and wearing a wild - half-afro.

I found myself wanting to see more and even better segments.  I liked the ""extra"" interview with Tom Snyder.  If you like Gilda, this is worth seeing.",1199145600,,574,4.524271844660194
2373170,5,B000A6T22Q,"Gilda Radner was one of the funniest comediennes of our time. She is listed up there with Lucille Ball and Carol Burnett. Though her life was tragically short, she left us some wonderful and brilliant skits from her time on SNL. This dvd shows just how diverse her comedy abilities were. She could be the biggest nerd ever, or a Brownie Scout trying to keep herself company in her room. Rosanne Rosannadanna always had 'somethin' to say. My one disappontment was that her song, ""Honey"" wasn't included on this dvd, though I recall seeing her do in on SNL. It's great fun to see her once again on the screen and laugh as hard as I did when SNL was in it's infancy. That type of comedy was new to America, and Gilda was a big part of it, Many comics today should thank Gilda for blazing a new trail in how we look and laugh at television comedy.",1196985600,3,843,4.3081761006289305

2373209,2,B000A6T22Q,"I agree with some of the other reviewers that the selection of sketches here is not as good as it could have been.  Gilda Radner was a very talented comedy actress but this DVD does not showcase enough of her best work.  Sure, the dance number with Steve Martin is a classic, as are a couple of the commercials such as ""Hey, You,"" but too many of these sketches show her playing a little girl, Lisa Loopner or the usually gross Roseanne Roseannadanna.  It focuses too much on her as an individual, not the integral part of the SNL ensemble that she was.  One of the major mistakes the producers of this and the other SNL videos I have seen is that when they take the sketches out of context they are much less funny in isolation than in the flow of a regular show.  I was disappointed with this, I didn't chuckle as much as I thought I would and had to skip through many of the sketches because they either rapidly got boring, or gross.  I won't be getting any more of these SNL compilation DVDs because they simply don't know how to produce them so that they are funny.  I noticed a similar problem with an SNL 25th anniversary compilation.  I think perhaps these are written and produced by the same people who write and produce the current SNL show -- which is very rarely even amusing and usually just a waste of time.",1145664000,14,1322,4.323886639676114

I had the VHS version that was released in the late 80's/early 90's and it was spectacular.  I had since lost the tape and have been waiting for the DVD to come out.  I really enjoyed the DVD and the special features that came with it.  There are some slight differences between the older VHS release and the new DVD release.

There are some skits involving ""Emily Litella"" and ""Rosanne Rosannadanna"" that are different.  The performance of ""Gimme Mick"" by ""Candie Slice"" is much better on the older VHS release, however the DVD version shows more of her character and why she is the way she is and it's quite funny.  Overall, I am very pleased with the DVD and am happy it is released.  The only thing missing was the classic ""Harley's Bristol Cream"" commercial.

Now as soon as they come out with the Best of Cheri Oteri, I will be even happier.",1128643200,15,1037,4.331606217616581

8075271,4,B000A6T22Q,Gilda Radner was one of The Original Not Ready For Prime Players when Saturday Night Live first came on.  When it first started I watched it because of Chevy Chase.  But after a few shows Gilda Radner became the standout.  Not blessed with great looks.  Her talent made her beautiful.  Everything she did made me laugh. Although some of her skits worked better then others.  I wasn't crazy about Candy Slice.  But Emily Litella Baba Wawa and especially Roseanne Rosanneadanna killed me.  And one of the funniest things on here is a skit with Candice Bergin.  I also wish they would come out with a dvd of just Roseanne Roseannadanna.
