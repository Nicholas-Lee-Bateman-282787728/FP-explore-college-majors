The first time I saw him on video (and this was the first one), I was horrified!  Let me explain.  Munch died in '68 which was well before my concert-attending years, but I had been collecting his LPs avidly from the late '70s on.  I felt that everything he touched was pure gold, the definitive recording ... his Beethoven 9th, certainly all the French repertoire, Berlioz, Franck etc.  His interpretations were so clean, straightforward, no-nonsense--he was my ultimate model of a musician, although I was training in an entirely different area (classical organ).

I had never seen him on video until now, and, o my, what a shock!  What a clown!  The gentleman I'd thought was so restrained!  How can I say this--he looks like a crazy old man conducting in front of his loudspeakers!  You know these fools who pretend to conduct with absolutely no idea what they're doing.  He waves, jabs, scoops, makes big mixing motions, all in musical contexts that have nothing to do with those gestures!

Well, I still LOVE the sound he makes--clean, serious and dramatic, just as before.  How the heck does he do it?  I still intend to find out :)

My only complaint is to the record company:  give us more!  They put out this Brahms First and Second on DVD, as if there were also gonna be a Third and Fourth.  Don't tease us like this, it's sorta cruel!",1401753600,4,1474,4.6
