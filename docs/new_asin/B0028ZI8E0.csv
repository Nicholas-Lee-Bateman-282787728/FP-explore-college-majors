3875402,5,B0028ZI8E0,"Tom Corbett although a product of its time, was also ahead of its time. In a lot of ways it's a template for Star Trek. Like Star Trek, there exists a space academy, where space cadets are trained. There are ranks of command, alien planets, futuristic devices, etc., all set around the same time frame as Star Trek. True, given it's the 1950s live TV and the budget is almost non-existent, the special effects would be considered crude today, but I find that part of the charm. The episode -Assignment Mercury-reminded me of several Star Trek episode where someone in command uses bad judgement and almost gets the ship destroyed, like the episode-The Doomsday Machine. Anyway, if you're serious about scifi, you'll want to investigate its TV origins, like Tom Corbett.",1241654400,12,769,4.877862595419847
3875403,4,B0028ZI8E0,"When I was a kid, Tom Corbett, Space Cadet, set in the year 2350 A.D. was my favorite show on TV.  Inspired by the adventures of Tom, Astro, and Roger Manning, my friends and I sent away for our Space Cadet membership kits, which I still have, and built our own, full size, Polaris spaceship in my basement. My grandfather made us a circular view port just like Polariss view port and we created spaceship controls out every strange gizmo we could find. We spent hours after school pretending we were Space Cadets.  I guess I still am a Space Cadet, because when I found that Tom Corbett, Space Cadet was available DVD I had to have it.
Tom Corbett, Space Cadet aired live, Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays at 6:30 PM from October 2, 1950 to September  26, 1952 on CBS, then later on ABC. After 1952, it aired on Saturday mornings on NBC until 1955.  The early shows were 15 minutes long. Later episodes were roughly 25-30 minutes each. This single disk contains four episodes, some with commercials for Kraft caramels, transferred from old kinescopes.  Considering how crude black and white kinescopes where, even in the 1950s, these transfers are pretty good. The four episodes are: Assignment Mercury, 23:00, Ambush in Space, 23:00, Fight For Survival, 22:00 (aired April 30, 1955), and Pursuit of the Deep Space Projectile, 28:00 (aired June 4, 1955).  All four shows date from 1954 or 1955.  Jan Merlin, who played cadet Roger Manning, does not appear in any of these episodes. Merlin quit the show twice, first in 1953. Then he came back for another season and quit again in 1954. He was replaced by Jack Grimes.  These four episodes all feature Jack Grimes who played cadet T.J. Thistle for one season, 1954-1955.
While Tom  Corbett was a low-budget show, it was better looking than its rival Space Patrol. It had bigger and more impressive looking sets and many more of them; the characters often went out into space or to a hostile planet wearing their space suits. While the special effects for Tom Corbett were crude and cheap, the show tried things that Space Patrol never did, like floating because of the loss of gravity or drifting off into space. One of the big pluses for Tom Corbett, was that the show employed a science consultant named Willy Ley. Ley, who was a friend and associate of rocket scientist Werner Von Braun, reviewed scripts and advised the producers and actors on how to keep the science in the show real.  Ley and Von Braun collaborated on a book titled: The Conquest of Space, about earths first orbiting space station. Movie producer George Pal (Destination Moon, War of the Worlds) later turned the book into a really bad movie of the same title. Ironically, the trailer for Pals Conquest of Space is also on this disk!
Besides the four episodes of Tom Corbett, this disk also has three BONUS ITEMS: an episode of the animated show Space Angel: The Ghost and The Crystal Mace, 25:00; a Superman cartoon from the 1940s, Superman: The Mechanical Monster, 10:00; and, as noted, the movie trailer for George Pals Conquest of Space, 2:38.  The entire running time of this DVD is 134 minutes.
Unfortunately there is no information in the discs packaging about these shows. There is only the cover sleeve, with a cheap drawing, a copy of the art inside the case, and a release date of the DVD: April 28, 2009.  The manufacture is obviously as cheap as were the Tom Corbett shows.  Spacemans Luck!",1360281600,10,3426,4.699499165275459
3875404,5,B0028ZI8E0,"Watching these episodes brought back early childhood memories of space travel as envisioned in the early 50's post WWII.  I recall when first watching the episodes as a kid that all the rockets shown were German V-2's.  The German rockets only traveled a few hundred miles, but with Tom Corbet flying them, they went to Venus and Mercury.  Very clever these Americans!",1353974400,3,368,4.903225806451613
3875405,4,B0028ZI8E0,"Wish there were more episodes, but the ones there are good.  The sound is weak on a couple, but usable.  I had no problem with cutting off part of the picture like one person here.  The added features are pretty corny, but fun.  Space Angles is one of those with still drawing with human mouths superimposed; sort of like the old Clutch Cargo cartoons.  In all, I'm satisfied with this.  I was 11 or 12 when Tom Corbett was on TV, and its fun to watch again.",1308096000,2,458,4.206896551724138

3875407,5,B0028ZI8E0,"If you grew up in the 50's, you may remember Tom Corbett and the other early science fiction shows. Here's a chance to revisit those days from a simpler time, when we were young and ready for adventure.",1287532800,2,202,4.342105263157895
3875408,5,B0028ZI8E0,"If you remember this show from the early days of TV you will definitely want to add this DVD to your collection.  The quality, considering the age of the broadcast, is quite good. This is definitely ""Early Sci-Fi TV"" as it used to be.  A great thrill to see it again. I highly recommend buying it>",1286755200,5,297,4.285714285714286
3875409,3,B0028ZI8E0,I became a space cadet reading this series when I was ten years old.  I never saw the series or even knew they existed until I stumbled across them on Amazon.  It's amazing how little they invested in those days in TV series vs. what they spent on movies.,1284336000,,255,4.183673469387755
3875410,4,B0028ZI8E0,"I haven't seen these, but Tom Corbett is my favorite of the old space shows. I like the Kellogg's commercials, the Jackson Beck intros and the whole set-up of the show. Frankie Thomas was cool as Tom Corbett, but from reading the reviews here and the item descriptions, it seems that my favorite character, the bad attitude Space Cadet Roger Manning (played by Jan Merlin) who was the coolest character in early TV children's shows, is missing. It seems like these shows are from later in the series after Merlin quit, which is too bad, but they should still be interesting to watch, as I've never seen any of the later shows. I'm giving this 4 stars because you have to give some rating, and I'm basing it on my previous experience with the show.",1281571200,4,747,4.54074074074074
3875411,3,B0028ZI8E0,"Don't expect too much from the infant days of television and you won't be disappointed.

Three space cadets fly the 3-finned, reactor-driven space cruiser Polaris.

Tom Corbett, the senior cadet, begins every episode with a countdown to blast off.

T.J. Thistle is the astrogator.  He is short - an advantage in 'Assignment Mercury.'  Due to heavy cropping, there are several scenes where Tom and Astro can only be seen from their nose down!  Fortunately, T.J. does not suffer their fate.

Astro is not a dog - as many Jetson fans might believe - he is just a man with no last name.  Astro is the engineer.

'Assignment Mercury':  Mercury, the closest planet to the sun, it is sunny-side hot and nightside cold.  They are to land in the twilight zone; they touch down in the wrong spot.

'Ambush in Space':  Convicts escape from a prison asteroid.  They have a score to settle with Tom, T.J., and Astro.

'Flight for Survival':  They are flying a derelict ship to a scrapyard, when the reactor goes haywire, and they must abandon ship before it plows into Venus.

'Pursuit of the Deep Space Projectile':  They fly to the star Sirius to retrieve a data tape from a probe; the mission gets dicey when they discover the probe is being dragged into the star.

There is no information about the series included.  Extras: 2 cartoons and a 'Conquest of Space' trailer.

First three shows:  Picture: poor to fair.  Significant cropping: left, top.  Distortion band: bottom.  Sound: fair.  Volume: low.
Fourth show:  Picture: fair to good.  Slight cropping.  Sound: fair to good.  Volume: normal.

3875412,4,B0028ZI8E0,"Compared to a few of the old TV series, I consider this one of the best.  I had purchased some of the VCR tapes a few years ago but the DVD provides better quality.  There are just a few of the episodes from the series on the DVD but well worth the price if you are into nostalgia sci-fi.",1256601600,17,288,3.864406779661017

8357238,5,B0028ZI8E0,"I loved Tom Corbett, but I was too young to understand the plots when it appeared on tv. Turns out, the plots are great! These episodes are more technically accurate than 90 prrcent of today's tv scifi. The plots are for kids, but the actors get into them. The special effects are completely cheesy. You'll love Franki Thomas reacting to a high g takeoff.",1445558400,,355,4.5625

8357243,5,B0028ZI8E0,"I'm old enough to have watched this when it was on TV.  It was fun watching and simultaneously remembering associated childhood memories.  Is the production corny and amateurish? Probably, but I don't care.  This is a fun watch, period.",1402185600,,236,5.0
8357244,4,B0028ZI8E0,"For those of us of a certain age, there is much to delight in, and a bit to regret, in this DVD.  The delight quotient is obvious: rediscovery of childhood enthusiasms which prove, some 60 years later, to have been not completely misplaced.  Crude as these programs are from a technical point of view - even the deliciously silly smoke sputtering, backfiring rockets that take off in a spiral from mountainous landscapes in the Flash Gordon series are more sophisticated than the rocket ship imagery here -  that very simplicity is one of this program's greatest charms. But more than that, the actors and the writing manage to engage our attention in a way that i find somewhat surprising, considering the subject matter and the time it was written.  These are characters that are still fun to be around.

The regrets, for me are two fold. I clearly remember the music that began each episode: a pseudo martial ode with the words ""From the rocket fields of the academy to the far flung stars of outer space""  Well in these episodes - which apparently date from before that theme song was written -  there is only some trite John Phillip Souza-esque strains to start things off.  More serious, neither Roger Manning,who i remember as a pleasingly acerbic character, nor Captain Strong are much present.  Manning not at all and Captain Strong for only one episode.  This is especially disappointing to me because of an amusing incident that I hope Ed Bryce, the actor who played Captain Strong and who passed away in 1999 would not mind me recounting.

I was about 11 years old when my loving parents arranged as a birthday present a visit to the set  where the show was broadcast.  Although it was a lovely idea it was terribly disillusioning for this eleven year old to discover how shoddy and un-spaceship like the reality of the Tom Corbett set was.  As if to make amends, Frankie Thomas, who played the title role gave me a script for that show and signed it ""Stay in the right orbit says big Tom Corbett.""

Ed Bryce was a warm and admirable presence as Captain Strong.  One trusted him.  No doubt that's why he got the role in the first place.  Well about ten years or more later, I was waiting for the train to New York at the Hartsdale train station and there on the platform in a trench coat was a disconcertingly familiar figure.  I was sure it was Ed Bryce. I approached him and said ""Excuse me but didn't you used to play Captain Strong on Tom Corbett Space Cadet?""  Ed Bryce looked at me. He said nothing but a strange smile came over his face.  His hands went to his coat.  He opened it.  He was wearing the Captain Strong uniform!!!  ""I'm going to a convention"" are the only words he spoke.",1401062400,2,2704,4.527835051546392
8357245,5,B0028ZI8E0,"Wow, space Cadets in barber chairs? Props looked better when I was five years old. The plot didn't make sense then, nor does it now. But I love it!",1389571200,,147,4.103448275862069
8357246,1,B0028ZI8E0,"Please understand, I like a lot of the cheesy old TV series.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flash-Gordon/dp/B00004Y2QO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flash Gordon</a>: I never get tired of it.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buck-Rogers/dp/B002KVSJ6O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buck Rogers</a>: an ageless hero. I love the tubby little spacecraft, wobbling along on their droopy streamers of sparks, the over-the-top costumes, and the clumsy fight scenes. But Tom Corbett just didn't do it for me. Too claustrophobic - the sets consist of about three rooms in the spacecraft interior, apparently decorated with refrigerator boxes. I mean, low budget is one thing, but scavenging props from the curb on pickup day is pretty bad. And the acting (if the word applies) would have been an embarassment to a fifth grade school play, even if the script had given it a chance.

Then there's the filler material. The 1940s Superman cartoon is a classic, I could get along with that. Unfortunately, Space Angel comes just before it on this disk. It's about the worst only-the-lips-move animation ever, except for some miserable 1960s or -70s throw-togethers by Marvel. (Full disclosure: I gave up after about 10 minutes. If there's anything worthwhile after that, I apologize to it. But, at ten minutes, it was not just bad but going downhill fast.)

I really like the cheesy old series. Flash and Buck are finely aged cheese, and have developed a rich and campy flavor with time. Tom Corbett, however, is just stinky cheese.
