8051458,3,B0007TKHVQ,"""Los Vampiros en Coyoacan"" isn't the first title most fans think of when asked to name a Lucha Libre film from the 1970s, which is a shame because in some ways it's better than most of them. One of the unintended benefits of these movies is that they preserve ring footage of many classic luchadores that might otherwise have been lost, and this film opens with a lengthy 2 out of 3 falls match with none other than the great Mil Mascaras himself. This is one of the best-filmed matches I've seen in a lucha film of this era, and it approaches a documentary-style quality.

The rest of the film is technically competent, and doesn't rely on either stock footage or padding with musical numbers unlike many other films from the era. Mil Mascaras not only is a true legend in the ring but definitely has charisma and while the late Superzan isn't as well-remembered as other luchadores, he could definitely deliver his lines well and avoids upstaging Mil. There's also some recognizable Mexican talent onboard including Sasha Montenegro in an early role. On the downside, the story is yet another slow-paced ""Dracula"" rewrite, and the inclusion of dwarf vampires in the second half of the film just doesn't work. Unlike an intentionally campy, comic-book film like ""Champions of Justice,"" ""Los Vampiros"" is actually hurt by having mini-henchmen stomping around.

Based on the opening in-ring action, I expected this to be a classic ala ""Santo in the Wax Museum."" It isn't essential viewing for most casual fans, but if you want to add an excellent filmed match to your collection (or if you are a Mil Mascaras fan), this one is worth your while.

Note: This is a budget release with no subtitles, no dubbing, and no extras except for a slideshow of publicity photos.",1348444800,3,1764,4.777049180327869
8051459,4,B0007TKHVQ,"This movie stars not only Mil Mascaras,argueably the greatest masked wrestler of the 20th century,but also German Robles,Mexico's answer to Christopher Lee. Though since El Vampiro beat Horror of Dracula to the screen by over a year you might want to think of Christopher Lee as England's German Robles. In this film Robles portrays a Van Helsing-like doctor who helps Mascaras and his tag-team partner Superzan take on a vampire king and his army of blood-sucking dwarves. This movie could have been better without the presence of Superzan,who more or less plays Robin to Mascaras' Batman here. Even with Superzan in it this is still a good mexiluchahero movie. It's not as much wacky tongue in cheek fun as Las Vampiras,another Mil Mascaras movie,but it's good solid entertainment.",1257120000,4,783,5.125
