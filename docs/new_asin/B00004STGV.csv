7922082,3,B00004STGV,"Ultimately this is a kind of cautionary tale about embracing excesses to the point of self-destruction and also seeing the true goodness in people. As Americans begin leaving some WWII era barracks empty in post-war Iceland, Icelanders begin occupying them. Coming to terms with their new-found independence, Iceland looks to move forward... Some Icelanders embrace American ways and indeed Americans, even marrying them and moving to the US. In the story, two young men, Baddi and Danni are reared by their grandparents as their mother marries an American and moves to the States. The well-known Icelandic director Baltasar Kormkur plays Baddi, the more gregarious of the two brothers. Danni, played by Sveinn Geirsson, is more reserved but more sensitive. Baddi eventually leaves to go to America, and when he returns with his ""cool American clothes and car"" he brings with him a certain appeal, otherness, likeability. He becomes instantly popular and the object of worship for the not so well off population of the barracks. A certain status is conferred upon him because he has attained a kind of worldliness the others can only dream about. Danni lives in Baddi's shadow, and for all of Baddi's endless talk of moving to America and achieving all these high falutin' dreams, Danni's quiet sensitivity and intensity pay off. Overlooked he might be, but he does achieve his dreams, while Baddi lets the excess he lives in go to his head, and he wastes his life becoming a lazy, violent, intimidating drunk. He also becomes rather jealous of Danni's success, but would never put in the hard work and perseverance Danni invested to make his dreams come true. The story does not have the happiest of endings, but it is nevertheless an interesting period piece with a kind of ""lesson"" and an excellent introduction/overview of Iceland during the inception of its independence.",1111449600,2,1876,5.074433656957929
7922083,4,B00004STGV,"In the years after World War II the American military forces keep a base on an Icelandic island, however, they move it away from Reykjavik.  The abandoned barracks are offered to the homeless of Iceland as they can seek shelter from the biting winters.  The Devil's Island depicts the poor people in this area, where they live, and how they deal with daily struggles where hope of leaving seems like a wishful dream.  Nonetheless, there are always ways of escaping the nagging pain of poverty, and those who escape the social environment are either hated or adored.  Devil's Island is an interesting film about a situation that many never would have known of unless Fridrikkson directed this film, which offers a good cinematic experience.",1082592000,5,739,4.935483870967742
7922084,5,B00004STGV,"I saw this movie ca. 1995 in Oslo with Norwegian subtitles, the only Icelandic movie I know and a shame I haven't had the chance to see others.  The movie depicts the relative wealth and attractiveness of American servicemen from Keflavik in the context of the extreme poverty of Icelanders living in an old quanset hut. The Icelanders can, of course, speak some English and the Americans can, also realistically, speak no Icelandic. Big, loud old American cars, rock and roll, and the desire to escape the crushing poverty. The film is memorable, and for another Icelandic viewpoint on the early drive toward globalization, read ""The Atom Station"" by Haldor Laxness.
Icelandic is a beautiful language, essentially the Norwegian of a thousand years ago, the Viking era. I don't understand it but wish I did!",1077580800,6,807,4.977777777777778
