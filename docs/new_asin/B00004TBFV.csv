1349870,4,B00004TBFV,"If you like movies with weird characters ,this is one of those films. 2 convicts break out of jail. One is a lunatic with a gold map who enjoys killing people and the other a computer crime fellon who is non violent. Along the way they pick up sexy Rose McGowen who is a dumb mute,supposedly. A crazy crooked cop is chasing them to get the gold map. After much gory killing of all the main characters,sexy Rose emerges with a suprise. In the end we get another trick suprise. The movie keeps you guessing what will happen next. It is much better then rose McGowns Doom Generation if your considering both",1243900800,2,604,4.401785714285714
1349871,3,B00004TBFV,This is a cute movie. Kind of a guilty pleasure simple and entertaining. Don't expect much just a few easy laughs. Plus I adore Rose McGowen.,1218067200,,141,4.461538461538462
1349872,1,B00004TBFV,"I wish there was a zero-star rating for this. So far, I've really liked Rose McGowan in almost everything shes done (and she really wasn't bad in this flick either). However the movie as a whole was a different story.

The movies wannabe Tarantino attitude just doesn't work with the sloppy writing and the poorly laid out plot lines. For example:
1) After going on a killing spree, the three protagonists continue to drive around in a pink 60s Caddy (it's set in the 2000s, so this car stands out a bit). When they get to a police roadblock, they just make a 3-point turn in the middle of the road, and the cops don't bat an eye.

2) After escaping from jail they find a series of clues to a gold mine, one of which is a map tattoed on a dogs skin. Now unless the rightful owner was only in jail for a week before the 'heros' broke out, I think the fur would have grown back over. If they shaved the dog (not shown), why was only the spot with the map shaved off.

3) Why would a NBK, poor-impulse-control type guy even be buddys with a white collar computer nerd in jail anyway ?  They swear undying freindship for each other, yet the nerd ditches the killer at the first opourtuinity, resulting in his getting arrested and almost getting hauled back to jail. When the killer catches up, the same guy who slaughters people at random throughout the film utters witty taunts and then forgives all.

Anyway, the gist is that the plot makes no sense, the writing isn't tight enough to make you care for the characters at all (sorry, you too Rose), and it tries way to hard to be a Tarantino film without any of the aspects that make his movies so much more than just gore-fests (oh yeah, BTW, blood is supposed to be dark red or brown-ish, not strawberry pink, all the bodies in this flick look like they has Strawberry Quik dumped on them). Do youself a favor, a quick shot of Roses' nips just aren't worth the pain here.",1212537600,2,1920,4.322222222222222
1349873,5,B00004TBFV,"My spouse and I  both enjoyed this movie--so much so that we have driven through southern new mexico and the quiet little town of Hillsboro!  Admittedly, not everyone will enjoy this movie, but it is one of my all time favorites that I still watch a couple of times every year!!!!  Rose McGown is great!",1168128000,2,303,4.472727272727273
1349874,5,B00004TBFV,"Did you like The Doom Generation? So did I, actually, I like it a bit more than a healthy person probably should. Rose was in that movie constantly, and she was, to put it kindly, quite vocal. I enjoyed this. So I couldn't imagine wanting to watch a movie in which she plays a ""mute"" - why watch a movie without that incredible voice? You know what's even better about Rose McGowan than her voice (hey, get your mind out of the gutter)? Her eyes. Guess how someone who is mute expresses themselves... with their eyes! Wow! The way she uses those eyes to reduce people to insect-status is incredible (guy... ""Can you hear?"" Rose's eyes... ""You are an idiot"" you... ""whoa, those are great eyes""). So what can I say? Love Rose McGowan's eyes, love this movie. Don't love Rose McGowan's eyes, well, I can't comprehend such a thing, so I can't comment in that case.",999820800,12,860,4.484076433121019
1349875,1,B00004TBFV,"An annoying trio of characters, an I'm-so-hip tone, atrocious writing and shooting, and a relentlessly smutty tone...this one, for me, didn't even  quality as ""bad is good"".  Not even worth the rental price.",966211200,9,207,5.242424242424242
1349876,3,B00004TBFV,"This movie is really cool.  It is a cheesy, short movie but it is funny.  Rose McGowan plays a mute girl perfectly and seductively throughout the  movie.  The ending makes the movie come together. It says that you get what  you deserve.",965952000,7,236,4.523809523809524

7922426,4,B00004TBFV,"""Lewis & Clark & George"" is a road movie/crime thriller/black comedy about two scumbags who escape from a New Mexican prison, Lewis (Salvator Xuereb) and Clark (Dan Gunther), the former's a murdering psycho with a charismatic spirit and the latter's a computer geek. The escapees immediately start searching for a gold treasure in a lost mine whereupon they hook up with literal gold-digger George (Rose McGowan), who happens to be mute.

The movie has that quirky, ""hip"" flare of movies of the mid-to-late 90s, like ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Michael,"" ""Mojave Moon,"" ""The Way of the Gun"" and ""American Psycho."" If you have a taste for these types of films you might like ""Lewis & Clark & George,"" which I find better than all of 'em except the first two.

The fact that the two main protagonists are criminal scum and George isn't much nobler works against the movie because it's impossible to root for them, but the film makes up for it in numerous ways. For one, it is consistently amusing and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, like the massacre of a group of annoying vacationers. Once you get the joke, you're able to kick back and enjoy the zaniness despite the characters' moral offensiveness. Secondly, the style of the film is entertaining, including the cool soundtrack (I realize describing it as ""cool"" is lame, but I didn't want to use ""hip"" again; and ""pop"" doesn't quite fit). Thirdly, there are at least two quality females in the cast with the focus on McGowan's character. Although George is an increasingly despicable character, Rose is certainly a uniquely alluring and curvy woman and she's in her prime here. Needless to say, this film's a must for McGowan fans. The other female is Paula Sorge as the lonely and hyper-sexed trailer trash. Fourthly, the climax offers a fitting ending for the ignoble ""protagonists.""

Another comparison would be 1966's ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" as both films take place in the American West, are very stylized, and feature three characters vying for treasure with the inevitable mishaps and double-crosses thereof. The differences being that ""Lewis & Clark & George"" takes place in the modern day and one of the three protagonists is a (hot) woman (there are, incidentally, zero notable women in ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly), not to mention the movie's only half as long at 83 minutes, which is a good thing in my book as ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" is definitely overlong, good (bad and ugly) as it is.

The film was shot in SW New Mexico, specifically Hillsboro, Kingston and Truth or Consequences.

Unless they enjoy a movie with no original ideas. Unless they enjoy a movie with no real surprises. Unless they enjoy a movie in which they could care less about any of the characters.

This is predictable fodder which was not worth the dollar...",1288569600,,416,4.698630136986301
