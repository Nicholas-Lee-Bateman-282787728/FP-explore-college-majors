2873699,1,B000RPD0KK,"Remember in the 90's when a whole bunch of T.V. movie versions of Danielle Steel's books hit the airwaves? How great most of them were, filled with passion, suspense, drama and glitz? Well, after watching this first adaption in ten years, I sure felt nostalgic for THOSE days! Melissa Gilbert, looking like she has had way too much plastic surgery, tries to act and sound (not even close) like a Frenchwoman mourning the loss of her husband and son. All she has left is an annoying daughter named ""Pip"" (no comment) and a dog called Mousse (double no comment). Well, she ends up meeting a bland guy (Brad Johnson) and they fall in love, against all odds. End of story. Really, because the acting, good pacing, spark and emotion are all non-existent. Plot devices thrown in for no good reason. Zero chemistry between any of the actors. And the intro by Danielle Steel was really odd. A huge disappointment, obviously slapped together in about 5 minutes. BRING BACK THE 90's!",1195603200,24,973,4.729411764705882
2873700,5,B000RPD0KK,"Safe Harbour delivers the emotion. Danielle Steel used to be a television staple but hasn't been around for about 10 years. Bravo for the producers who brought it back and did such a fine job of staying true to the source material. If you've read the book, you won't be disappointed by the movie. As A Danielle Steel fan, this is first rate.",1195344000,3,341,4.428571428571429
2873701,3,B000RPD0KK,"Melissa Gilbert is plays a Frenchwoman who lost her husband and son in a devistating plane crash that occurs right in front of her eyes. She is left to raise a daughter alone.
On a remote beach in California, she meets an artist (played by Brad Johnson) who she first mistrusts and then grows to love. Through a series of events, love begins to bloom between the two of them.
This movie was a disappointment to me. Although the idea of the movie is great, the movie almost seems to lack heart. The pace of the movie goes very slowly and there does not seem to be any rhyme nor reason to the plot. The chemistry between Gilbert and Johnson is sketchy at best and their love scenes, while an attempt at passion is tried to be created, seems to be forced and overblown.
The best chemistry of the movie is actually between Liana Liberato, who plays Pip, Gilbert's daughter in the movie, and Brad Johnson. They have some of the finest scenes in the movie, drawing together.
Also while Melissa Gilbert is a fine actress, her attempt at a French accent is second-rate and laughable. I thought it was a joke when I first heard her speaking. It is definitely not her best work.
All in all, I was quite disappointed with this movie.",1194912000,4,1222,4.435555555555555
2873702,5,B000RPD0KK,"I was not disappointed!  Sobbed at times (which is good!)  The movie stayed close to the storyline of the book (which is very good!)  The minor differences did not really matter, though I am a purist and would like to see movies exactly as written.  I agree it was hard to deal with Melissa Gilbert's accent, but she did it well.  Brad Johnson was warm and wonderfully romantic.
Love Steel's books and wish they would make more movies, especially the American historical ones like Thurston House.",1194393600,2,496,4.72093023255814
2873703,3,B000RPD0KK,"This movie would have been alot better if Melissa Gilbert didn't use that phoney accent and all that lipstick. She looked old beyond her years. She looked the best in the one scene with no lipstick. The movie would have carried on fine if she were just an american. And I even thought ""Matt"" felt uncomfortable pronouncing her ""French"" name.  Other than that it was an ok movie.",1194393600,15,378,4.5588235294117645

However, although Melissa Gilbert is one of my favorite actresses, having watched her grow up from little Laura in Little House on the Prairie, I was somewhat disappointed at her attempt at a French accent. In fact, her accent was a bit irritating as there didn't seem to be any difference in her French accent and her Russian accent in Zoya.

2873865,5,B000RPD0KK,I found that this movie stayed very true to the characters in the book. Any differences did not change the story line.,1404777600,,118,4.409090909090909
2873866,5,B000RPD0KK,With the well known performers in this you may feel safe. Brad Johnson & Melissa Gilbert melt together in this story so well. All because of an adorable young girl creating the introduction. He was a painter & the young girl liked creating pictures herself. The recently widowed French mother in time following healing emotions responded favorably so all were happy. Of course there were a number of challenges in the story line for all that had to be resolved to make it very interesting. I review this one every once in a while.,1402099200,,530,4.648936170212766
2873867,3,B000RPD0KK,"Safe Harbour is your typical Danielle Steel love story about two lonely people who find each other's heart and no explanation is given why they fall for each other except that a love story has to be told.

Pip is a once a normal kid with a happy life,But she became very lonely when her father and brother died. Her mother Ophelia has trouble dealing with the loss and becomes depressed as well. While walking on the beach one day, Pip meets Matt,a person who is suffering from a broken heart. She immediately befriends him and together they try to cope up with the difficult situations that they are struggling with. A conflict is needed so there has to be one. One day,Ophelia  sees them together and suspects Matt of being a pedophile. But nevertheless, it doesn't take long before her mother's suspicions are put into rest and eventually Matt wins over Ophelia's heart as well. They get married and becomes officially a father to Pip. Credits roll.

This movie provides scenery as it was shot at San Francisco. Obviously,it was clichd and predictable. Also,it was painful to watch is the performance of Melissa Gilbert as Ophelia due to her poor French accent which became a distraction during the dialogues. But if you like this particular Danielle Steel novel,this adaptation of won't be a disappointment as long as you overlook Gilbert's performance.",1401408000,,1357,4.8405172413793105
2873868,4,B000RPD0KK,"Nice story.  It was interesting to see Melissa Gilbert play a part with a French accent.  Not one of Danielle Steel's best, but still enjoyable.",1398297600,,144,4.72

2873871,5,B000RPD0KK,Anything Daniel Steel writes turns out to be a great movie. I wasn't sure Melissa Gilbert could do French accents but she pulled it off. I am sorry that they cut out some characters but all in all it was good.,1390435200,,209,4.121951219512195

2873895,5,B000RPD0KK,"I loved this movie. I love Danieele Steele. She Is My Favorite Author. To feel loss and to love again is wonderful. Just a wonderful love story and Melissa's characters forgiveness is heartfelt and very touching. Melissa Gilbert is such a wonderful actress (although I didn't care for the french accent). This movie is one of my favorites. Her daughter is such a sweetie too and Brad Johnson I have loved since I first saw him in Midnight Express. He rocks,",1371686400,,457,4.654320987654321

2873900,4,B000RPD0KK,"Without Brad Johnson, this movie would not be worth watching. His inter-action with Gilbert's daughter is definitely the highlight of the movie. Gilbert does not make a sympathetic French widow - she is just pathetic! And those siliconed lips are revolting. Nevertheless, I'd watch Brad Johnson in almost any movie. Gorgeous, lovely man.

2873903,1,B000RPD0KK,"Wow, this was the first time I've seen one of the Danielle Steel movies. What a complete waste of my time. Melissa Gilbert has really overdone the plastic surgery. It was uncomfortable just looking at her, but even more painful listening to her. She delivered such an amateur French accent...atrocious! The leading man was boring and not particularly appealing. His badly dyed hair was rather distracting as well. Nuf said",1326585600,,422,5.042857142857143
2873904,4,B000RPD0KK,"I chose this film because I like Melissa Gilbert's efforts. I have watched it several times and find it continues to hold my interest. I concur with the poor ratings for Melissa's ""French Accent"". Otherwise, it was very pleasant to watch.
 Ophelia McKenzie is a widow still in shock from the death of her husband and son in an airplane crash. She is borderline suicidal and only hanging on to sanity out of concern for her young daughter. Her daughter befriends a lonely neighbor man she encountered while exploring along a nearby beach. The relationship growth between these three strangers covers the course of the film. Eventually, all three find ways to help each other recover from their respective hurts.
 Okay, I know. The whole premise is sappy. But Liana Libertero (daughter Pip) and Brad Johnson (lonely divorced neighbor man) make the premise work. Liana was especially engaging as Pip.
 One other point I got from the film is how horribly some of the women behaved. For once, the men were spared from a portrail as filandering lotharios.
 One of the main sticking points for me was the cheesy CGI explosion of the aircraft carrying the husband and son, shown in a flashback scene. It would require a near nuclear explosion to vaporize an aircraft this way. Aircraft simply don't disappear this way, even if destroyed by a powerful bomb. This plot device seemed an especially weak one to me.
 The other sticking point was the way everyone's lovely home was kept so immaculately without any effort on their part. The house of Ophelia was very large and would require a lot of effort by groundskeepers and household help to maintain in the condition shown. Ophelia and daughter had been gone for a whole summer, but the grounds and house were well-maintained and the house plants well tended. Yet no one was there to greet the owner's return.
 I noticed on the credits that Melissa's real-life son Dakota Brinkman had a bit part as her dead son Chad. He had no speaking part, but Melissa may be trying to break him into the acting game",1321401600,,2044,4.743661971830986

I was so excited to see it was on DVD, but not impressed at it over all. There was so much left out and if you haven't read the book you would have no clue what was going on, the transitions weren't smooth in the story like the book.

2873936,4,B000RPD0KK,This 2007 Danielle Steele film is a winner....One of the best in the film series in my view. The cast is excellent and the plot offers some unexpected twists and turns. At the heart of the film is a touching love story that moves you and emphasizes the triumph of the human spirit.,1200614400,,281,4.320754716981132
2873937,2,B000RPD0KK,"""Half-Pint"" from ""Little House on the Prairie"" dons a cheesy and uneven French accent while mourning the death of her much older husband and son, as she neglects her surviving child. When her daughter befriends a divorced artist, they form an unlikely friendship which turns to romance.

I had a difficult time refraining from wincing from Glbert's atrocious accent, which brings the film down a notch or two. The performances overall are okay, but the story is entirely too predictable. There was more chemistry between the daughter and the love interest - I just didn't get the feel that these two suddenly became soul mates. Gilbert's accent was just so distracting and annoying; the only actress to pull off a worse accent is perhaps Jennifer Love Hewitt in ""The Truth About Love"" which is another must miss.",1200355200,17,812,4.927007299270073
2873938,2,B000RPD0KK,"I am not a particular fan of romance novels in general or of Danielle Steele in particular. Nonetheless, I am always ready to be entertained. But Melissa Gilbert's character in this movie was so dreadful I cringed every time she came on the scene.

First, there is her awful French accent. It is annoying, distracting and completely unnecessary to the story. Second, there is her incessant self-pitying which makes her into one of the most unloveable romantic heroines I ever ever seen. Third, she is one-dimensional. And she is ugly to boot. It is simply not believable that the hunk would fall in love with this wreck.

The best part of the movie is the relationship between the hunk and the daughter ""Pip"". Indeed, Liana Liberato delivers the best acting job in the movie as the lonely daughter of a mopish mother who finds a friendship with Brad Johnson's character. Their relationship is far more deep, believable and meaningful than the so-called romance between between the two adults.

And don't even get me stated on the sappy subplot of Opelia helping the homeless.

Btw, as of this date, Amazon's IMDb site does not show this movie is now on DVD.

2873939,3,B000RPD0KK,"This movie was ok. Not Melissa Gilbert's best and I LOVE her movies! She speaks with a french accent and it threw me off immediately. I had a hard time getting ""into"" the movie because the accent was so unlike Melissa and it took about half of the movie for me to get used to it!  LOVE Brad Johnson and he is as dreamy as ever although I really didn't feel chemistry between the two actors. Overall, not bad, not great.",1198627200,2,419,4.172839506172839

2873942,5,B000RPD0KK,"As always, there's always part of a Danielle Steel movie that will bring tears to my eyes.  Tears of joy, sorrow, passion . . . you get the picture.  It's those special moments of her movies (as well as the books) that take me away from the rat race world we are living in these days. Does it matter that Melissa Gilbert's French accent wasn't perfect?  I've never been to France, so it didn't bother me at all.  Ms. Gilbert was as beautiful as always and the actress who played Pip was so sweet and loving.  She was so cute trying to play matchmaker for her Mom.  I loved every second of the movie and was wishing for more as the credits rolled.

Yes, I admit it! I'm proud to say that I'm one of Danielle Steel's biggest fans.  I've loved every book she's written AND I've watched every movie based on one of her books (many of them over and over again). I just can't get enough.  Please don't make us wait another 10 years for another movie . . .  it would be my wish that at least one new movie, preferably more, would be released every year.  It would certainly be a wonderful gift in my Christmas stocking. Better yet, have you given any thought to having a Danielle Steel Movie Channel?  I'd subscribe.  For the time being,  I'll have to settle for the Lifetime Movie Channel.  They know a good movie when they find one.",1196380800,,1327,4.2730923694779115

2873944,3,B000RPD0KK,Melissa Gilbert is starring as a french woman mourning the death of husband and son. The accent really throughs this character off. I don't know why they couldn't have changed that for the movies' sake. She is so busy trying to get the accent together that she forgets to act. It is in developing and almost stops short of an ending. There are two VERY intimate bedroom scenes so I don't recommend this movie for a younger audience.,1195776000,6,432,4.551282051282051
