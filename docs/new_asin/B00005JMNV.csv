1505366,4,B00005JMNV,I had a copy and someone took my dvd.  I was really happy with my copy.  I would definitely purchase from them again.,1289779200,,117,4.043478260869565
1505367,1,B00005JMNV,"I love Bollywood movies. I have watched and enjoyed at least a hundred of them, some of them in India. I love Hrithik, and I love Abishek. So this movie sounded promising, with both of them starring. Do not be fooled,  is a disaster. It is silly and immature , even for Bollywood, with some very annoying secondary characters. I won't comment on the contrived and simplistic plot, because that is not usually a turnoff for this kind of movie. Here, it is because there are no redeeming features. The overall quality of this film, such as I received it from Amazon, is so deplorable it makes you give up looking for them. The sound is tinny and hardly audible. The music in the songs cannot be heard over the lyrics. The picture is just as bad, hazy and impossible to get to fill the screen. In fact there is no menu, so you can't even skip to the music numbers and watch Hrithik do his thing and dance. Try as I did, I could not keep watching this defective product. I give it a star, but it doesn't even deserve it served as it is. Be warned!",1281916800,5,1043,4.267676767676767
1505368,3,B00005JMNV,"I'm a diehard Hrithik Roshan fan, but this movie was just not his best.  Once you've seen Dhoom 2 and Jodhaa Ackbar there's no comparison.  I would have still purchased the DVD just because I want every movie with him in it.",1281139200,2,224,4.309523809523809
1505369,3,B00005JMNV,"First, I LOVE the movie, very fun and very Bollywood. :) However this DVD made by Amazon on demand is not good quality. It does not have a root menu (can't select scenes) and the picture quality overall is not as good as it should be. The transitions between scenes are choppy and one scene that is completely missing. I've seen this movie on 2 other DVDs so I know how the quality should be and what is generally on the standard DVD. 5 stars for the movie, 2 stars for the DVD.",1269648000,8,478,4.150537634408602
1505370,5,B00005JMNV,"One of the things the Hindi film industry is learning as they market their product to a western audience is that the titles are often too long.  This film was obviously made before that conclusion was drawn.  The title is an interesting play on words, however, since Prem is not only the name of the two male leads, but also a 1960's word for ""love"".  This movie is basically about a love triangle.  However, like most Bollywood films, Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon offers its own take on the familiar story line.  The underlying theme of this movie is sacrifice - not only for the person you are in love with, but for your family and friends as well.

Kareena Kapoor plays Sanjana, a sweet tempered but rather feisty young girl who is determined to marry for love, no matter what other plans her mother may have in mind.  So, when her mother arranges for a rich young businessman named Prem Kapur to come and stay with them and check out their daughter as a potential wife in the process, Sanjana is determined not to cooperate.  The trouble is, the man they bring home from the airport is played by hunky Hindi heartthrob Hrithik Roshan, and before Sanjana can say ""Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai"" he's managed to melt her heart (along with the hearts of her father, her servants, her four best friends, her dog, her cartoon parrot, and at least half of the audience).  Sanjana's mother is thrilled until she learns that the man her daughter has fallen for is not Prem Kapur, the owner of the muti-million dollar company, but his business manager and best friend, Prem Kishen, who was sent ahead when Prem Kapur was detained.  By this time it's too late and Sanjana is hopelessly in love.  While her father supports Snjana's love, her mother shows just how mean-spirited a greedy woman can be.

I do not necessarily recommend this film for your first Bollywood experience, but for those of us who are initiated and accustomed to the inherent silliness and sometimes over-the-top acting in Hindi films, this is a great watch.  The scenic photography is breathtaking and the songs are some of the best I've ever heard in a Bollywood film.  Kareena Kapoor is lovely and, while as an actor she may not possess the wide range of Hrithik Roshan, she is very likable and believable in her role.  By the way, when it comes to Hrithik Roshan, forget about the Adonis body and archangel face.  It's the hypnotic innocence in his devilish green eyes that gets you every time.

If you are new to Bollywood, I recommend ""Krrish"" or ""Dhoom 2"".  After you're hooked, come back and check this one out.",1252540800,3,2570,4.586433260393873
1505371,4,B00005JMNV,"We have girl (Kareena Kapoor)finishing college vowing not to sell out to marriage and only seeing negatives for women in it. She is going to choose for herself.
Her sister sets up a potential proposal with a guy Prem (unbeknown to her). A different Prem (Hrithik Roshan) comes along. The parents encourage the marriage thinking he is the other one. They fall for each other.
Then the expected Prem (Abhishek Bachchan), the first Prem's best friend and  boss, turns up expecting to look over a potential wife.
The girl doesn't know about the setup or the mix-up and treats him well as Prem #1's best friend. She has more in common with Prem #2 but has formerly fallen for Prem #1.
No more spoilers -when all is discovered who will she go for...? So we have the usual Bollywood mixups and complications.
The actors are good to spend time with. Hrithiks character is a bit over the top - doing Krrish-style naive innocent with a love of life. Abhishek does believably shy and Kareena is her usual bubbly or distraught self. However I like them enough to excuse the excesses and appreciate more time with them.
In some 'rush of blood to the head' moment, someone decided a bit of comedy here and there would be fun. Fortunately mostly we have a movie of straight romance. However be ready to be irritated by an animated parrot and a little cocker spaniel morphing into a cartoon dog on some occasions (what were they thinking?????????) Also they could have done with out the requisite characature comedic figure. This time it is an extremely rotund, half-blind man staggering in wrong directions and mistaking people. The Indians seem to like this stuff but it doesn work for me and seems out of place here.
The music is OK but except for one song not particularly memorable and the dancing sparse. So Hrithik doesn't get let off the leash to strut his stuff- though he does get his shirt off a few times so the camera can take in those rippling muscles!
This is overall a nice light-weight offering in the romance genre. It may not be the best Bollywood but OK to spend time with - particularly if you like a bit of romance or these actors.",1232409600,2,2137,4.579634464751958
1505372,5,B00005JMNV,"I love this movie, it's cute and you got to love the respect between boss and employee,two best friends. My favorite song has got to be 'Kasim Ki Kasum"" I just love how Karina Yapoor sings this song. I'm new to Bollywood films, but all the ones I have, have at Hrithik Roshan in them, I'm a serious fan.",1135987200,6,303,4.1525423728813555
1505520,5,B00005JMNV,Must see movie. I can watch this movie over and over again and believe me I have. If you haven't seen this movie you must. Its a must see must buy movie that won't disappoint you. FYI its a love story but a great love story.,1468627200,,224,3.891304347826087
1505521,5,B00005JMNV,"3 of my favorite actors - This movie is a good whole some love story, and if you enjoy love stories you need to watch this one. Very good dancing, music, and great interaction within the characters. Hrithik Roshan, Abhishek Bachchan, and Kareena Kapoor gave a very good performance. If you like love stories, you much watch this movie and add it to your collection.",1468540800,,365,4.630769230769231
1505522,4,B00005JMNV,"Just love Kareena and Hrithik and tho his exuberance was a little over the top, it was still somehow loveable, and she was beautiful as I've ever seen her. Abhishek Bachchan also really likeable and very handsome in this movie. It always hurts my heart how the family, esp. father or mother, but even a sister or brother who should know better, thinks they know who someone should marry for status or their ideas instead of honoring her love or his love with a perfectly good person whom they are deeply in love with, and expect them to go give life and body in a state of sadness, family betrayal which exposes that the child is not really loved, and suffer a lifetime of lost love in which both feel cheated; and not realizing that it's not love that they are giving their child  but sacrificing them to their ego, status, authority instead. Anyway..., that plays out in the second part of the movie, once again as a major theme in Indian love stories. But it was light and lovely in so many places, good music and beautiful scenery and clothing and sets; fun and playful in many ways, and full of heart. Overall I liked it a lot",1465689600,2,1131,4.411483253588517

1505576,3,B00005JMNV,"Okay will give this one a three stars based on the cast managing to act at all  because they are pretty much being held hostage in what looks like a Disney Tweeny movie complete with cartoon and I do mean animated parrot. The cartoon dog pops up on demand and no I'm not making that up.

 This is a mildly cute plot line, emphasis on mildly,  with Two Prems and some mistaken Identity. That much you already know . The story is not a bad one per se just very child like . The only problem for the producer is whether or not he was trying to rope in an older audience . If he was he bombed on that one. If his target audience was young families with children about 10 years to what the heck lets stretch the imagination big time ( consider the parrot) and say 15 max then he was dead on. The only reason I can see watching this one over and over would be for the Hrithik Roshan beefcake even though his character seemed like he had been hitting the cold medications a little hard in the mornings. Perky beyond perky and taking his shirt off alot. Seemed like he was imitating Salu.  Abi's very well understated acting on the shy guy was a good performance. Plus Abi's just plain cute in his own right . Might pop it into the player again sometime soon.

Save this one for the Tweeny's or when you are feeling very nostalgic and instead try ""The Game"" with Abihishek or let's see ""Agneepath"" was to violent for me...hmm try Hrithik in Krish was enjoyable.. Dhoom 2 just for his Dancing in the front and the end of the movie though I did like it except for the lame lines they gave Aish.  Zindagi Nah milegi dobara heard it was good . There's always Desi Boyz much better fun and script but neither one of them is in that one ...sorry was beefcake distracted there for a minute..Side note if you are really strict about any rolling around on the beach scenes then preview it before the kids, no nudity or swearing . Ten and above should enjoy it.",1340496000,3,1943,4.235135135135135
1505577,5,B00005JMNV,"This is one of the better bollywood shows that are available on the American market. I personally watched this film last night and I really liked it a lot! Main Prem has a little bit of all: Music, comedy, beautiful mountain scenes shot in New Zealand and romance. All actors play well and Hrithik Roshan gives a fantastic performance.
A neat little special feature of this film are the two pets, a Cocker Spaniel and a red parrot. No other bollywood movie I have seen so far has pets (with co-starring roles) in them. Whenever them two get excited or do a special task they are drawn like a cartoon, really funny - WATCH IT!

The show itself plays in modern India. Sanjana is a college graduate. Her mother is very keen to get her married to a rich, eligible bachelor, Prem. Sanjana is taken aback by the extreme measures that her mother undertakes to ensure that Prem, who comes and stays with them for a month, likes her daughter. As Prem arrives, Sanjana does not like him at all! His habits and extraordinary hobbies are opposite of hers. But as she gets to know him, they fall for each other. As her Prem is away on business for a few days, comes along another Prem who walks into her life as though he was meant to. What will Sanjana do? Whom will she choose? ENJOY THE SHOW!",1317600000,,1282,4.38655462184874

7940212,5,B00005JMNV,"This is the first Bollywood movie I ever watched.  It got me into the genre.  Its absolutely over-the-top, patriarchal and cheesy (sometimes painfully so) but I freakin love it.  The musical numbers (once you get past the first one) are so much fun and the romance is lavish, plus, Hritik Roshan.  Dance king Demi-god and biggest heartthrob.  Everything that you can criticize this movie for only endears me the more to it.  Some people like B rated horror flicks.  I like B rated Bollywood.  Sue me.  :P",1526256000,,504,4.7011494252873565

7940214,5,B00005JMNV,"Loved Hrithik in this as always with his movies - I fall in love with him all over again!  He was really young,but his sweet, kind delivery in movies hasn't changed to date. I feel like I'm on a journey getting to know Hrithik thru his movies,You tube videos and Face Book posts. He is always so sweet.  I would believe him to be like this in real life.  Maybe some day I'll get to find out - I'd love that!  Continue making cherished memories in your movies.  Did you ever think of directing your own movies.  Kareena was fantastic in this movie.  The character of the movie is so truly honest.  Continue doing movies that let your character shine through, Hrithik!.  Hopefully more of your movies will be carried on Amazon.
