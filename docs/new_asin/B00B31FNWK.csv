8561895,4,B00B31FNWK,This was a funny at time movie I love Hindi so I enjoyed it.  The music was great.,1478736000,,82,3.5555555555555554
8561896,3,B00B31FNWK,"I was amazed at how bland I felt this was. I'm never excited by Ajay Devgn under the best conditions, but here IMO he was more bland and indistinguishable from other generic heroes than usual. I wasn't thrilled by any of the action sequences, nor did any songs affect me. My sister, however, who watched with me, and who adores anything Sikh or Punjabi, found it enjoyable.",1468886400,,373,4.582089552238806
8561897,3,B00B31FNWK,"It was an ok movie. Funny at times but to see Ajay Devgan play a scaredy cat and run from the bad guys was no fun. He needs tough guy roles, not comedy or sissy roles. It's just not him.",1456012800,,186,3.675
8561898,5,B00B31FNWK,"Fun, fun, fun with a GREAT soundtrack. Ajay Devgan is so humorous in this film. It is one of my favorites. Look out for SD too. He is ....",1447804800,,138,3.793103448275862
8561899,4,B00B31FNWK,Enjoyable and entertaining with some nice dance numbers and music.,1438300800,,66,5.7
8561900,4,B00B31FNWK,"I enjoyed this movie and would have given it five stars except it dragged a few times and became a little dialog heavy for my tastes. Admittedly that may be a cultural difference, since I do not speak Hindi, assuming that they are speaking Hindi and the substance did not translate.
The special effects were some of the best I have seen and I like well made wire kung fu, science fiction and fantasy movies. This movie was an unusual mixture of brawls, ensemble musical pieces - not the usual Bollywood, although I am not aware of the genre trends within Indian cinema- and comedy drama.
The characters were interesting and three dimensionally full drawn. My impression is that the actors were top Indian movie stars since I have since seen their faces on other Indian movie posters.
My recommendation is if you want a break from the standard fare take a look at this movie. I thought it entertaining enough to keep and watch again in the future.",1416009600,,946,4.603550295857988
8561901,3,B00B31FNWK,This is one that I felt is so-so. I really like Ajay Devgan as an actor but not in a comedy role. I like him better in a tuff guy role.,1388448000,,135,3.3870967741935485
8561902,4,B00B31FNWK,"I found this movie amusing and funny. The actors, I think, carried this show rather than the script. The ""Po Po"" song was really very cute. I own this film because I like all the actors and I have friends who will enjoy this too.",1363996800,3,229,4.111111111111111
