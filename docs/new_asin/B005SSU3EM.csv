8485416,2,B005SSU3EM,"Stop me if youve heard this one beforea group of friends takes off for the weekend getaway to a secluded cabin in the country.  Along the way they meet a local who warns them to leave the area.  Sounds like just about every slasher film ever made except the one difference this time is that its a UK produced film and set there as well.  On thing will become quite apparent by the end of the filmthe Brits should stick to highbrow dramas and leave the slasher films to the U.S.  After about a half hour of Dont Let Him In, you will be shouting, Please let me out!

Paige (Sophie Linfield) and her husband Calvin, are joined by Calvins sister Mandy and her new boyfriend Tristan for a trip up to a family cottage in the country.  After the prerequisite warning by a creepy local who lives in the woods, they arrive at the quaint cottage.  They receive a visit from a local police officer which underscores just how utterly dumb this film is in every aspect.  The officer talks pleasantly about the great fishing and the huge trout that one of the men from the nearby village caught.  Then, as casually as if he is ordering afternoon tea he warns them that there is a serial killer on the loose called The Tree Surgeon who hangs his victims body parts from trees.  He warns them not to go out after dark before cheerfully wishing them a nice day.  You know if someone warns me that a serial killer is on the loose Im packing up the car and heading back home, regardless of the great fishing.

When Calvin disappears early on, Paige cannot phone the police because of no signal on her cell...yet earlier in the film it was established that the local village was a mere 10 minute walk from their cottage yet no one thinks to head into town for help.  Mucking up the affair is a sub-plot involving Tristans devious business dealings that is never fully fleshed out or resolved.  He spends every moment excusing himself to take an important call on his cellfunny but he never had a problem with his signal.

On top of all this, the film is just weak by any horror standards.  The twist was telegraphed from a mile away and we only actually see the Tree Surgeon kill only one person in the entire film.  So if you are big into gore and body counts, the film is a major disappointment.  We don't even get the usual T&A which is typically a standard in slasher films.  The film only runs around 80 minutes but the height of audacity is that the DVD comes with a making of documentary that itself runs 41 minutes.

8485419,2,B005SSU3EM,"A trip to the English countryside ends terribly for four travelers after they mistakingly take in a hurt stranger, who may turn out to be the notorious serial killer of local legend! Kelly Smith's slow-boiling thriller throws back to classic genre entries like WHEN A STRANGER CALLS, but there is something severely lacking from the very start. We are immediately introduced to four terribly unlikeable characters: a cold and uncaring couple, the lead's lackadaisical sister, and her irate one-night stand, who only goes on the trip to escape the authorities for some unknown crime. The audience is so thoroughly annoyed by the time the four reach the cabin that we pray for some dark hero to come and kill them all, saving us from any further suffering. He does arrive, and they 'let him in' of course, so that things can finally get underway. What follows is a tedious back-and-forth between two potential killers as the women try to decide who to trust, but when Smith plainly tells the audience who the real villain is by depicting the first murder instead of alluding to it off-screen, there can be no mystery or suspense. It is best to heed the film's warning and DON'T LET HIM IN!

8485420,3,B005SSU3EM,"This is a low budget British slasher film, light on British humor. The film opens showing us a scantily clad woman who is escaping from the lair of the slasher and then it flashes back two days. So by the time the credit roll is done, we know the brunette is going to survive, and most likely everyone else will die.

Calvin, (Rhys Meredith) a rather boring chap who we don't get to know in the 76 minutes they allot this film, is going to his family's country home. His brunette girlfriend Paige and top billed actress (Sophie Linfield) is going along with him. She is a nurse. His blond sister Mandy, (Gemma Harvey) who never met a man she didn't like, is coming along as well as her one night stand friend Tristan, a man even Will Rogers wouldn't like.

Tristan has money and a secret. He has lived in the area where they are going. Meanwhile the friendly neighborhood policeman tells us there is a slasher loose known as the tree surgeon because he dismembers his victims and hangs them up in trees, although not like what we see on the DVD cover, but more like fastening them to the tree with barbed wire. Apparently body part props would blow the budget.

In order to set the stage, a Traveler i.e. gypsy reads Tristan's palm and freaks out, telling everyone to turn around and go home. It was a nice touch. The film gives you so many clues about Tristan being the killer you know it isn't him...or is it?

The picture has all the elements of a good slasher. The execution was fine, but the script and characters were boring. I kept waiting for this thing to take off, and finally when we got back to the opening scene I couldn't wait for this flick to end. It needed better humor and a shower scene.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, no sex, no nudity. 2 1/2 stars.",1347667200,,1763,4.362804878048781
8485421,1,B005SSU3EM,"This movie seemed like a compilation of every slasher movie cliche ever made.  You have your requisite rich guy jerk who treats everyone like they're beneath him, your requisite whore, your requisite strong, plucky heroine who finally faces the killer alone, and the killer was one of the worst slasher villains I've ever seen.  He went from being a seemingly sane, normal person to a drooling, giggling
geek in a single scene.
 Like my title says, the cover made me pick it up, but the movie was a total waste.",1337558400,,511,4.655555555555556
8485422,2,B005SSU3EM,"The movie was very slow to get going.  I started cleaning the living room for the first half of it.  Then all of a sudden alot of things happen in the span of about 20 minutes.  The things that happen are a series of one person betraying the other and who to trust and not to trust.  The remaining portion of the movie is a chase seen that has a bleak unsatisfying ending.

The acting was pretty lame especially the blonde girl.  For some reason the writer/director decided to make her character stupid...extremely stupid.  A stupid character ontop of bad acting makes a viewer not care what happens to them.  The other actors weren't much better.  The only plus I can even thing of in this movie is the brunette female lead.  Her character at least shows some throught in the actions and the actress does try to work with the sad script.

I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.  Infact, the only reason for the two stars was the brunette female lead's character does attempt to fight back and figure things out...as opposed to the other characters.",1333411200,2,1053,4.542553191489362
8485423,1,B005SSU3EM,"I've watched slow-starters before, but this movie dragged for the full 10 minutes that I gave it to draw me in.  The scenery & the players were dismal and the script was juvenile:  First, you invite your dysfunctional adult sister to join you & your wife on a quiet getaway out of town?  Then, you cave in on her pushy curbside plea to also allow her new male friend, whom you've never met, to come join you around the campfire?  I mean, really?

I confess to jones-ing for some good bloody gore once in awhile, but this one found my husband, having murmured ""ugh"" minutes before I did, watching me from afar to see how long it would take me to wave a white flag and choose a new film to pop in.

In summary, I ""let him in"" but then I sent him packing (I re-sold him to Amazon).  This one's a waste of time compared to the many frightful heavy-hitters that I've acquired through Amazon.",1330473600,4,886,4.269461077844311
8485424,4,B005SSU3EM,"Picked this movie up due to the way the cover art looked, unfortunately you don't see that tree in the movie itself although there is another tree with body peices hanging on it.  With that aside the movie was decent, some gore, some suspence, a decent body count, and an obnoxious jerk named Tristan who is fun to hate.  Not so twisted of a plot to not see what's coming.  Probably no Academy Awards comming for this one but it was a fun ride for the price.",1326067200,12,458,4.241379310344827
8485425,4,B005SSU3EM,"DON'T LET HIM IN is a tricky thriller with some red herrings.  It is also a compact film clocking in at around 75 minutes.  Calvin and Paige are a thirtysomething couple heading off for a weekend retreat in rural England.  Calvin invites his younger sister Mandy along who in turn asks if she can bring her new boyfriend, Tristan, along.  Calvin reluctantly agrees and the four head off for a relaxing getaway.  Of course, that's not in the cards for the couples.  Tristan is an obnoxious snob; they encounter a hitchhiker who they ignore, a strange woman who lives in the woods and reads palms and finally the local constable who warns them about ""The Tree Surgeon"", a serial killer on the loose.  Later, an injured stranger named Sean ends up on their doorstep who nurse Paige takes in to assist him.
We know from the film's opening that Paige will confront the Tree Surgeon...so just who will the serial killer be?
DON'T LET HIM IN has some clever twists and keeps you guessing.  The cast is pretty good especially Sophie Linfield (Paige), Gordon Alexander (Tristan) and Sam Hazeldine (Sean).  The movie has an unexpectedly dark finale which I didn't see coming.
All in all, a different kind of thriller.",1325980800,8,1207,4.70952380952381
