8319192,2,B001LNOKME,"I love Alex Kingston, but this was pretty strange.  Spoiler ~ Ms. Kingston squats and pees on a tree and a wolf sniffs the tree then follows her.  They end up on a boat and the story is shown from her time on the boat with the crew and a man who inaccurately  relates the story at a Victorian dinner party sometime afterward.  The word sumptuous in the description is just wrong.  It's cheesy and dark and seems like a B movie attempt for a young Ms. Kingston.  It wasn't enjoyable watching her prefer the wolf to men.  It was dreadful actually.",1447286400,,545,4.284313725490196
8319193,3,B001LNOKME,"I bought this because I am a Alex Kingston fan.  To say I had very mixed reactions after viewing it would be a major understatement.  The staging is clever but the story line does not hold water.  Maybe there is a backstory I am not familiar with that would have helped.  I thought my confusion would clear when the movie ended and then started again.  I thought, okay, the first was through the eyes of the lout.  Now I will see the version through her or someone else's eyes.  But no, it was the same movie repeating over and over again.  Too bizarre for me.",1439078400,,560,4.266666666666667
