8456820,4,B0054PSY6I,Good movie,1454112000,,10,4.5
8456821,2,B0054PSY6I,There are many other DVD's you can waste you money on. This one was a waste of my money. Buy something else.,1399852800,,108,3.9545454545454546
8456822,5,B0054PSY6I,"I decided to buy it after I was too tired to watch it. (It was 10 at night and I had school in the morning.) I bought a copy and I do not regret this purchase! Personally, I would not watch this with kids in the room. There are sexual themes in this movie; it's a bit hard to miss with one of her co-workers on top and she is looking shocked.
This movie is good! Just pay attention and it will make sense!",1397433600,,405,3.8333333333333335
8456823,4,B0054PSY6I,"finally that rat of Brandon Routh got what he deserves, the movie was good, kind of violent but good, sometimes it takes black humor to kill someone.",1372204800,,149,4.555555555555555
8456824,5,B0054PSY6I,I viewed the movie Miss Nobody two times to fully understand the movie. It was enjoyable and at times quite humorous. I did not know the stars but I would like the see more movies with the starring actress.,1343260800,2,206,4.3076923076923075
8456825,4,B0054PSY6I,"Leslie Bibb plays Sarah Jane McKinney, a paper-pushing secretary with a terrible haircut.  When she accidentally kills her boss (Brandon Routh), she finds herself zooming up the corporate ladder.  But if she wants to stay on top she's going to have to kill again.  And again.

Despite the premise, Miss Nobody is a frothy confection of a film.  Rarely has murder seemed so light-hearted.  There are a few sequences that veer into satire, but those bits remain quick and shallow.  While I say this, I must admit that there is a delightfully nasty twist at the end.

Many parts of Miss Nobody are predictable.  Of course there's a cop boarding in Sarah Jane's house.  Of course they fall in love.  Of course he's assigned the case.  Of course someone knows what Sarah Jane did.  Of course the person tormenting her is pretty obvious.  But Miss Nobody doesn't really intend to surprise you.  It just wants you to laugh.  And I did.

The casting is terrific.  I'm always happy to see Missi Pyle (Josie and the Pussycats) and a little bit of Vivica A. Fox (Ugly Betty) never goes amiss.  Bibb may be a blonde bombshell, but she plays mousy and browbeaten pretty well.  It's entertaining to see her body language change as she grows more confident through romance and murder.

I don't think I'm going to go out a buy a copy of Miss Nobody - I saw it on satellite - , but I enjoyed finding and watching it.",1340582400,4,1399,4.516
8456826,4,B0054PSY6I,"I happened to catch this one on TV, and it was definitely interesting. Not a typical boring cliche movie. It has a pretty original story line, and Leslie Bibb does a great job playing this character. She comes off as playing a sexy character but still somewhat awkward at the same time, and she makes it work. The only thing I really ""disliked"" about the movie was the apparently rampant amount of perverts and sexual harrassment at her work, and how everyone was in on some big secret plot. Aside from that, it was good and had a good ending.",1322697600,4,543,4.44
8456827,4,B0054PSY6I,"This is a good example of the potential of dark or black comedy. It's actually funny but also has some really twisted moments. The plot was pretty original too. I love the idea of the employee killing off her bosses. The finale is a bit deus ex machina and the scene itself has almost no lighting, but other than that the film has a good mix of comedy and creepiness throughout.",1322697600,3,378,4.338028169014085
8456828,5,B0054PSY6I,"I actually discovered this little gem through Amazon's streaming video competitor, Netflix.  I like Leslie Bibb (she's nice to look at), but she really displayed her comedic acting chops in this little known movie.

The plot is actually light-hearted, despite the dark subject matter (killing the executives to climb to the top) and is probably predictable, but I enjoyed the humor and charm of Bibb.",1320364800,4,400,5.138461538461539
8456829,4,B0054PSY6I,"I very much enjoyed this film; it reminds me of a darker version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amlie-Blu-ray/dp/B004ZG5EYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amlie [Blu-ray</a>].  It's a great ensemble cast (Adam Goldberg, Brandon Routh, Vivica A. Fox) led by the fantastic Leslie Bibb.  Bibb owns this role.  Also, I think the writing and the direction are excellent.  The dialogue is crisp and the direction style is fast paced and energetic.  It's great to see a different kind of movie like this.

I haven't bought the DVD yet, but will update the review when I get a copy.",1313798400,3,617,5.8
