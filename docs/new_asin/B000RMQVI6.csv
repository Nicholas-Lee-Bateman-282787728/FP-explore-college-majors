8454495,5,B000RMQVI6,"After staying away from the keyboard for more than 20 years, I came across this DVD.  It seems like it was made just for me, a 66 year old.  It was slow and easy.  I loved it.  This DVD was a great find, like a treasure.  I highly recommend purchasing this product.  It has 20 lessons in and if you master these easy to follow and do lessons, you will feel comfortable using your keyboard and you will be able to play.  This won't make you a master but you will be able to play.  I don't know if there is a level 2 DVD out there.",1425254400,,529,3.878504672897196
