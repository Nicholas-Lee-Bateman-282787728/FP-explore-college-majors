991262,5,6305183309,"I watched this movie for the first time when I was a child (probably 7 or 8 years old) and I remember even then how much it touched me.  It was so sad, and mad me want to cry.  I've never been very emotional, so that was quite an impression on my little life at that time.  We had taped it off TV and I used to watch it all the time for several years following.  Just recently I remembered about it and set out on a quest to find it!  How great that AMAZON sells it to the public and at a great price, too.  If you are a parent, you should buy this movie if not for yourself, for your child.  It will help them learn about kids who are ""special"" and how a person should treat them.",1005091200,4,681,3.8214285714285716
991263,5,6305183309,I saw this movie in the theaters when I was 8 years old. It was playing as a preface to Mary Poppins. I liked it better than Mary Poppins! I can still remember the feelings it left me with....it was a very emotional film and  the characters are wonderful.

991564,5,6305183309,"I don't remember purchasing it.  Jenny Agutter was in Disney's Ballerina when she was age 12.  She has been in Sci Fi movies.  Other than this, I've forgotten this ancient DVD. I don't even think the format is supported now.",1385510400,,224,4.55

991570,1,6305183309,"THis DVD has no subtitles or coptions. So, though the film deals with the lives and situations of deaf children. Deaf children cannot watch this film. Disney is heartless.",1334448000,21,171,4.931034482758621
991571,4,6305183309,"OK, this is a review of the actual DVD from Amazon... and it's a real disappointment. This film was shown theatrically in a 1.85:1 widescreen ratio (or 1.75:1, depending on whom you ask). This DVD is full-frame, 1.33:1, and worst of all, it is in poor condition - looks like a rip from the original VHS tape. The only thing good about this is that it is the film, and it is available in this authentic, direct-from-Disney effort. It's a real shame.",1314144000,20,448,4.475609756097561
991572,5,6305183309,"it's great to see this fine family film available again and getting some attention. i was always impressed with this Disney classic since i first saw it at the movies thirty years ago. it is a fine film with a heartfelt message and is also one of Disney's most mature family offerings.
this film also features a wonderful performance by hard of hearing actress Nanette Fabray. Fabray had stuggled long and hard for the rights of deaf persons and her efforts in life are much vindicated with this well made and intelligent film.
 this is definitely one of Disney's more intelligent offerings period. as a life long Disney fan who has seen all the classic Disney films from the past, i find this film refreshing in the fact that it uses very little of the conventional Disney formulas. there are no cute animals or children causing trouble and destoying things for slapstick guffaws, and there are no catchy little song tunes or fantasy references. just a lot of honest sentiment and a lot of realism which is suprising for a Disney movie from the past.
 this film is a true winner and fans of old school Disney should check it out if not add this to their collection or a school or public library. this film is a true blessing and will bring you many blessings from the Lord for buying it. God bless.",1310256000,11,1299,4.547008547008547
991573,5,6305183309,I watched this movie with my daughters when they were young.  Such a heart warming story.  I would love to have a copy on DVD.  Please let me know when it becomes available - I know each of my daughters would also like a copy.,1269302400,,226,3.977777777777778
991660,5,6305183309,"AMY is a wonderful family movie. I am absolutely shocked by how difficult it is to find. Disney doesn't even acknowledge it on their own websites. It should really be re-released - shown on the Disney channel, then released on DVD. Every family needs to see it at least once.",1264032000,,275,4.52
991661,4,6305183309,"I didn't really know what to expect from the movie itself. I ordered it mainly for the theme song performed by vocalist/actress Julie Budd. But it did turn out to be a great family movie that teaches some good values.  Video and sound quality was good considering the year this movie was released.

  There were some problems in the purchasing process which I feel Amazon.com could have handled with less hasty judgement and more flexibility. It was very unfair, inconvenient, and time consuming for them to turn my account over to a third party collection agency and make me pay additional fees to restore my account in such a short time window. It was also an insult to my character as a customer of good faith.

  Other than that, I'm satisfied with the product and the timeliness and condition in which it was received.",1251763200,,823,4.673611111111111
991662,5,6305183309,"I have been looking for this movie for a long time, I am glad that I found this movie on VHS today but I am surprised that it's not on DVD yet because it''s such a GOOD movie!!! It's a Disney movie about deaf and blind children and this nice, kind, sweet, and loving lady named ""Amy"" left her home and her mean husband to a new town to teach deaf children at a school for the deaf and blind how to speak after her own deaf kid died. It's a heartwarming, loving and touching movie!!  And Just because it is made by Disney it's a nice and clean movie! So you don't have to worry about kids watching it.",1240704000,2,600,4.0
991663,5,6305183309,This video is hard to find but a favorite of our family. It is a heartwarming story about an neglected wife who leaves her husband and hides as a teacher who successfully tries to teach the deaf to speak. In doing so she discovers her own self worth.,1202601600,,250,4.229166666666667
991664,5,6305183309,"I think Disney did a super job in portraying the plight of Deaf and Blind children at the turn of the century. And I think films like this helped bring about changes in legislation such as IDEA ( individuals with disabilities act). While this story does have some tragedy in it, it was not an easy time for institutionalized children back then. And contrary to what others wrote, the train scene was not gory. The fact that the school did not have the funding it needed to protect the children further speaks of the injustice and maltreatment of disabled children of the past. Kudos to Disney.",1124755200,4,593,4.60377358490566
991665,4,6305183309,"AMY is an altogether wonderful drama from the Disney studios, with Jenny Agutter a glowing presence in the title role.  This was originally intended as a made-for-television feature before the filmmakers decided the film was worthy of a full cinema release.

The story concerns a young woman named Amy Medford who escapes her domineering husband and becomes a speech-teacher in a school for deaf and blind children.  She meets with resistance from head teacher Malvina (Nanette Fabray) though her methods soon earn the approval of the other teachers and the children, who grow to adore her.  Amy forms a particularly-close bond with the deaf Henry Watkins (Otto Rechenberg) before a tragic accident shatters the peace and Amy's husband finally discovers her...

Jenny Agutter offers surprisingly low-key performance and the film is all the better for it.  This is a simple human drama from Disney, one that has been cruelly-neglected and it is such a shame because the movie has so much going for it.  The supporting cast includes Margaret O'Brien, Kathleen Nolan, Lou Fant, Barry Newman, Lance Le Gault, David Hollander and Bumper.  Julie Budd sings the movie's theme song ""The Many Ways to Love"".",1122076800,,1198,5.107692307692307
991666,1,6305183309,"I can't believe Disney ever made this horrible movie.
This movie is singly responsible for my lifelong fear of trains!
Of course the last time I viewed this movie, I was like 4 years old, so I really do hope I have my facts straight.  I ordered this movie to verify my facts.
As I recall...at the end of the movie there was a dance party.
I'm sure the rest of the movie up to this point was dramatically great, but NOT the last part.
I think this is how it happened:  A deaf student ran out of the party because he had a nosebleed.  Another student who was blind (I think), ran after him.  The first student got to some railroad tracks, and walked/ran down one direction.  The other student, not knowing what direction to go, went down the other.
Because the one student was deaf, he was hit by a train, and my brother said ""hey look, his head!""  I don't know if this was true, but if it was...this was by far the scariest movie of my life considering my age.
If I am correct, and the plot is accurate as I describe, Disney should really be ashamed.

7885435,3,6305183309,"I have 3 DVD players and this disc did not work on any of them. Finally, I just used my Amazon firestick account and asked for it to be sent to my TV. That is how I was able to see it. I needed to see it as the boy on the cover, Otto Rechenburg, is my client. I have been too busy to ask for a refund of what I paid for the unplayable DVD, but that would be nice.",1501545600,,363,3.493827160493827

Patients and understanding is what Amy was trying to teach her class and to herself. I recommend this DVD

In the memory of Helen Keller, Amy works with the children using determination & common sense to bring out what they need to say with their voice to compliment their hand signing. Nanette Fabrey plays another teacher who doesn't believe in thinking out of the box, but learns a valuable lesson in a moment when she is asked to help.
