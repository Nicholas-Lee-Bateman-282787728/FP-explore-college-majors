7287683,4,B00ZQ36R4Y,"Here are my thoughts on the movie Max.

After his brother Kyle is killed in war, his loyal companion Max is distraught; not wanting to listen to anyone. Once Max sees Kyle's younger brother Justin, Justin becomes the person that Max warms up to for the moment. Later, Justin and his family begin to ponder the circumstances of what really happened to Kyle, as Kyle's war friend Tyler returns to town.

In terms of acting, I really enjoyed Thomas Haden Church's outing as Kyle's and Justin's dad Ray. Robbie Amell plays Kyle; and though he's not given much screentime, I feel he did a good job. The dog who plays ""Max"" named Carlos is the star of the film; and Max as a movie is at its best when the dog is on-screen. There are some touching moments in the movie, mostly due to Max the dog himself.

Max's pacing as a movie can be uneven at times. Certain scenes in the beginning of the movie would feel rushed and some of the dialogue would have me scratching my head. That too-and Josh Wiggins, who plays Justin Wincott was just not convincing enough as one of the leads. But in spite of its shortcomings, Max still is enjoyable-even if its not great, due to the adventure of the movie, the better and more likable performances coming from Thomas Haden Church and Robbie Amell, and because you can't help but like Max the dog himself. So though it won't please everyone, the movie Max is

7287684,5,B00ZQ36R4Y,"How do you feel about animals? Do you like dogs? I certainly do! And here we have a dog who has not only earned our affection, but our RESPECT! We become acquainted with the Malinois, which is a Belgian version of a German Shepherd, a bit smaller but every bit as smart.

Dogs have had an important role on battlefields since World War I and have been honored for bravery time and time again. There have been over 3,000 war dogs used in Iraq and Afghanistan; at the time of the filming (2014) 26 dogs and 25 handlers have died in Afghanistan.

This wonderful PG-rated movie, written and directed by Boaz Yakin (""Safe"") is about a war dog. We first meet him in Afghanistan with his handler, who has trained him from a puppy. The two are inseparable until a betrayal leads them into a fatal encounter, which leaves the handler dead and the dog with a serious case of PTSD. (We know this from the trailers.) His behavior at his handler's coffin in a small Texas town is goosebumps all the way!

Our cast:
  * Carlos, in his debut performance, is Max, traumatized by events in Afghanistan and sent back to his handler's family in the United States to recuperate. He is grieving and vicious. By the way, can you imagine the impact of the Fourth of July fireworks on a repatriated war dog?
  * Robbie Amell (""The Flash"") is Kyle, Max's beloved Marine handler, too soon dead, so we see him only in flashbacks. His father taught his sons that a hero always tells the truth, even when it hurts.
  * Thomas Hayden Church (""Lucky Them"") is Ray Wincott, father of the dead Marine, led to believe that Max was the cause of his son's death. This former Marine sees no alternative but to put the dog down.
  * Lauren Graham (""Parenthood"") is his wife, Pamela. She has lost her elder son and now is afraid of losing her increasingly defiant younger son. But just wait until this sweet Texas housewife gets angry!
  * Josh Wiggins (""Hellion"") is their younger son Justin. While endlessly playing his video war games, it never occurs to him that his brother might die, and he certainly has no interest in babysitting a DOG. But what a joy it is to see three teenagers jump on their bikes to take on hardened criminals just because it's the right thing to do!

This involving movie has clear-cut characters and situations, so we quickly come to love our hero, his family and his dog; fear and loathe the villains; feel the frustration of being a powerless teenager; and ache to see the truth revealed. This film slipped in under my radar so it was a pleasant surprise, and the screening audience actually applauded. Don't miss this one!",1436400000,3,2617,4.516949152542373
7287685,3,B00ZQ36R4Y,"Both my folks and I have always been avid animal lovers--dogs especially. So as soon as we saw the trailer for this, we wanted to see it. And while we all left the theater having enjoyed it, I can't help but also have some mixed feelings over it (but more on that in a second).

Max is a Malinois Shepherd dog serving in Afghanistan with his handler, Kyle. While on a mission, Kyle is killed in action, and Max, having formed such a strong bond with him, won't respond to any other handler. However, when the dog takes a liking to Kyle's younger brother, Justin, he's sent to live with his family. It then falls on Justin to help Max through the PTSD he's obtained from combat, and in the process, Justin learns the true meaning of responsibility, doing the right thing, and being a hero...especially when it comes to light that some of his late brother's friends and squad members were doing less than honorable things overseas.

The dog, Max, of course, is who we all came to see, and I think anyone, dog lover or not, will like him. His undying loyalty is both moving and a tearjerker, and he conveys plenty of emotion just in his eyes and actions. As for the human cast, they all do a decent to excellent job. Justin starts off as a slacker who doesn't really respect what his brother does, but gradually, learns to be a better person. His dad is an army vet who wants what's best for his kid, and while being tough and no nonsense, he also learns to be more truthful about his feelings. And Justin's two friends are both likeable, and, by extension through Justin and Max, are able to better their lives and distance themselves from shady characters.

The main problem I have with this is the plot and pacing itself. Other reviews have called it a bit ""disjointed"" and ""manipulative"", and I can't help but agree. Certain scenes seem to be set up just to make you cry or feel sorry for the characters...and sad thing is, it kind of worked. It's impossible not to like Max, but I wish that more of the focus stayed on him and his history with Kyle, rather than the plot with Justin trying to expose the arms dealers within his late brother's squad. On that point, I DO give credit to the writers for not painting the military as rosy and perfect, and that there ARE shady dealings going on within our own ranks, and that it's our responsibility to stop these people and do the honorable thing.

None the less, I've seen this plot done before, and done a bit better. The old, ""person learns to do better by befriending an animal"" routine. While Justin IS likeable, I think we actually learn more about his friends than we do him. And while I feel bad for Kyle dying, we know little to nothing about him (which makes it all the stranger why Max would bond with Justin so quickly--another thing I think was rushed a bit--he starts listening to Justin in literally the first scene where they first meet).

I guess what I'm getting at is that I think this is a movie that didn't really need a villain. It could've simply been about Max and Justin bonding with each other. Or even better, it could've focused on Max's bond with Kyle, and their adventures and missions together on the front lines. Drama can come just from life and nature itself, and not a physical ""bad guy"".

But I guess I'm judging by what I would've LIKED to see, versus what I got, and as it stands...it's okay. I DID like it...I just think the focus should've been different. Honestly, the real pictures they showed in the end credits made me cry more than the actual movie. If you're an animal and/or dog lover, then definitely check this out. But if you want to see the ""human bonds with animal"" plot done a bit better, then check out movies like ""Beethoven"", ""K-9"", and ""Dolphin Tale"" (and that one was actually based on a true story).",1435968000,20,3807,4.439198855507868
7287686,5,B00ZQ36R4Y,"My wife and I just got back from the theater where we saw Max. We both left the theater in agreement that it was a wonderful movie. My wife commented that it reminded her of the kind of movies she grew up with, and she meant that it a good way.

The movie centers on Max, a military canine who developed a strong bond with his Marine Corps handler Kyle. When Kyle is killed in action, Max is so traumatized that he is unable to bond with any other handler. But he takes a immediate liking to Justin, Kyles juvenile delinquent younger brother. Kyle is a hacker who makes extra money pirating copies of video games for a local criminal named Emilio. Kyle is withdrawn from his mother and hostile to his father Ray, a former Marine wounded in Operation Desert Storm. When his parents find out that Max is about to be put down because no other handler can work with him, his parents bring the dog home and make him Justins responsibility. The problem is that Justin doesnt want the responsibility.

At the bike park, Justin meets Chuys cousin Carmen, who teaches Justin how to interact with dogs. Justin and Max quickly develop a bond, but is that strong enough to overcome the wartime trauma that Max has endured. Just when it seems like Justin and Max are making progress, Kyles high school/Marine Corps buddy Tyler comes home from Iraqmonths early. He claims that his early release is due to shrapnel injuries. Tyler quickly bonds with Ray, wounded Marine to wounded Marine, and ray gives Tyler a job. But Tyler isn't the wounded hero he portrays himself to be, and he uses his position in Rays business to engage in criminal activity that puts Ray into danger. Its then up to Justin, his friends, and his dog to come to the rescue.

Max is a perfect movie for dog lovers and a nearly perfect movie for everyone else. Most movies that pit teenagers against criminals are farcical, especially if they're not trying to be. Max manages to avoid that pitfall. Its not Air Bud, but a realistically if imaginatively written story. The Script was tightly written by Boaz Yakin (Remember the Titans) and co-written by Sheldon Lattich (Bloodsport and Rambo II). Yakin also directed Max. From what I saw on screen, its clear that they researched the heck out of the subject of military dogs.  Yakin and Lattich managed to create an almost perfect mix of emotion, suspense and action. It was also well acted. Newcomer Josh Wiggins plays Justin Wincott. Thomas Hayden Church (Wings) and Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls) play Justins parents Ray and Pamela. Mia Xitlali plays Carmen.

Not only will I be recommending this movie to my friends, I will probably be buying copies of it when it comes out on DVD to give as gifts to my dog loving friends.",1435622400,45,2732,4.613168724279835
7287687,5,B00ZQ36R4Y,"A Belgian shepherd dog named Max, used in service in the war in Afghanistan, comes home after his master, a member of the Marine Corps, dies in combat.  Maxs masters younger brother Justin is a snide adolescent boy whos becoming more rebellious against his dad.  Reluctantly, Justin takes responsibility for Max, and by circumstances rather than his own choice, gets pushed in the direction of heroism.  This opportunity for Justin to be a hero comes when one of the Marines who served with his brother pursues criminal weapons transactions back home in Angelina County, Texas, in the same neighborhood where Max and Justin and Justins parents live.  (It was filmed in North Carolina, though, the end credits reveal.)  The safety of Justins parents depends on him and Max working together with two of Justins buddies to stop the criminals and save Justins dad.

While its exciting, its also quite creative in how it uses the forests for the action scenes.  The action is very well coordinated, taking advantage of the landscape of the forest to create disasters and getaways in the suspenseful chases.  The movie also exudes a powerful nonverbal bond between Justin and his father which develops through facial reactions and events more than through dialogue, and the movie delays for a long time in revealing information about Justins father:  these are ingredients for a well-developed narrative.  Justin doesnt suddenly choose Im not going to be a jerk anymore but instead is forced by situations to decide what to do.  By the time his PARENTS question his integrity, we the AUDIENCE know why he cant tell them specific details that would endanger their lives.

The dad is cast really well as a don't mess with me Marine vet without much emotional expression and an impenetrable mustache, and Im pleased with the portrayal of the kids also.  They are your typical goof-offs but are clearly decent at heart, all 3 of em.  It also leaves you on the edge of your seat about what will happen to Max.  When I see a suspenseful movie for the first time (which I just did in the theater for this movie), Im scared about whether it will turn out well, and then the second time, Im able to enjoy the suspense more.  This is definitely a movie I will watch again eagerly.",1435536000,140,2264,4.781491002570694

7287732,2,B00ZQ36R4Y,"I must be the only one with any amount of common sense to see this movies flaws as they are. It baffles me immensely how this movie can get this much positive praise.

There is a certain amount of 'suspension of disbelief' that one must enter into when watching any movie, but this is supposed to be a tale that edges closer to reality than a superhero spectacle, and yet we find too much leaning toward the latter. Is it REALLY plausible that high ranking gun runner criminals are also interested in acquiring pirated video games from U.S. adolescents? Is it plausible that the boy's brother's best friend from the Marines just happened to be from the same town, that they enlisted and were assigned to exact same unit and one came home a traitor to our country without any military justice after being expelled from it?  Is it plausible that the dog whose handler is now dead would then be handed off to his family when said dog has been deemed dangerous due to PTSD?

I could go on, but I won't The whole movie is like this, with one completely implausible plot device after another, bad writing. Seriously, did a 9 year old write the screenplay?  Max is also known for the most lackluster acting performance by Josh Wiggins who plays Justin. His delivery and range was about as depth filled as a half inch piece of pine board. Pay attention and you'll see him smirking in scenes where he shouldn't be, offering flat statements during times where he should be showing anger and remorse, and being about as lively emotively as a zombie on prozac. The only reason I have even given the film 2 stars is because the other actors at least tried to do their best to weather this mess. Barely 2 Stars",1512259200,,1696,4.496753246753247

It gives a serious look at the reality of an intelligent & capable protection dog, as well as detection & interaction with threats.  Yes, there are a couple dog fights by the Malinois w/ gangster's Rottweiler guard dog's.  Nobody dies back in home environment, only on battlefield at first of movie.

The movie certainly showed the deep bond between the dogs and their handlers, as well as their adopted families. I enjoyed the training video as well as seeing the dog in protective mode. It was a good tribute to the service dogs of our military. And I am sure glad none of the boys family or the dog died at the end.  I happily give it 5 stars....great movie both for kids and adults to watch, especially for those men who have been in the military.",1504137600,,611,4.117647058823529

7287768,4,B00ZQ36R4Y,"This movie was a big hit with our 10 year-old son.  It's an interesting mix of stories since it deals with the lead character's brother dying in battle, a bit about the dog and then another story line comes back to let them have a bit of action to wrap things up. As a parent I give this high marks for being watchable.  So many of the kid oriented movies (e.g. Diary of a Wimpy Kid) are torture to sit through and this was never like that at all.",1502064000,,447,4.01123595505618

7287770,5,B00ZQ36R4Y,"I love, love, love this movie and recommend it to anyone who enjoys hero movies.  Be warned though, there are some extremely sad moments.  With that said, there is something about this movie that has nothing to do with this story that really bugs me.  The timeline seems to be around summer time with the 4th of July celebration and all the kids out of school (if the date was mentioned, I missed it).  In the summer most states it's HOT in the summer.  So, it bothers me that this dog, a family dog, a hero or even just the actor dog runs around on HOT pavement and sits in a metal cage in the middle of the yard with the sun beaming down on it.  I'm an advocate for animals and I hope people know this is not appropriate care in real life.  I'm sure the dog actor had great care and many breaks from the heat but in real life, protect your dogs' paws.  If it's hot to you then it's hot to them.",1501200000,,896,4.051136363636363

The dog's eyes when all that was going on made me weep uncontrollably, as it reminded me of my husband's eyes the first time we went to see a fireworks show.  So many don't understand what that does to our veterans.  Since then we stay home and keep away from the noise as much as possible.  Please keep this in mind the next time you have a party with a veteran living close by.  The nightmares can go on for weeks, year after year...I love you Jeffrey.",1483833600,,572,4.25

Max is an amazing movie and I love that the actors are not A-list movie stars because it allows the dog to be the A List Movie Star. It is a great movie and I thank God for service animals and our great men and women who train them.,1473638400,2,294,3.7580645161290325

They are smaller than the average size GSD's (80pounds) and much smaller than the large old-fashioned size (120 pounds).  They are very smart dogs used in the military and police force.  They are used to get into tight spaces that the larger GSD's can't get into. Their coloring isn't nearly as pretty as a GSD.  The acting in this movie is mediocre, at best.  Kind of like a Life Time movie.  If I knew that, I wouldn't have wasted my money buying this DVD.  It's the kind of movie you watch once.",1471046400,,617,4.380530973451328

7288080,4,B00ZQ36R4Y,"I've heard enough folks throwing shade on this movie that I went to see it with lowered expectations. I'm no Fancy Dan. I'm a simple guy who loves to watch movies. And I liked Max. When it started out lookin' like a sensitive family drama but then peeled away into action thriller territory, I didn't nit-pick it for its identity crisis, for being a movie that ""didn't know what it wanted to be."" It's because I fell madly in love with that battered war dog. I posit that the dog submitted the best acting performance here.

You look at the premise and the assumption is it's a sad movie, bring the hankie, you. And it is sad, during the early moments. Maybe my biggest knock against the movie is that it doesn't explore the dog's trauma even more. As it were, its weep factor isn't as strong as in Old Yeller or Marley and Me or even Turner and Hooch. That's okay.

Max is a precision-trained military dog, a Malinois breed deployed to track and sniff out hidden caches of munitions. Along with his handler, U.S. Marine Kyle Wincott (Robbie Amell), this four-legged veteran has served two harrowing stints in Afghanistan. But when Kyle falls to an ambush, Max succumbs to post-traumatic stress disorder. Nowadays, Max can't handle sharp noises. Sounds of gunshots and explosions tend to catapult him into coma. He'd bonded so closely with Kyle that he can no longer obey anyone else's commands. Not functional anymore as a service dog, Max is about to be put down when Kyle's family steps in and adopts him and brings him home to Angelina County, Texas. We note right away that Max seems to find some sort of affinity with Kyle's troubled younger brother, Justin (Josh Wiggins). So that's where I anticipated the plot's focus. A family drama about a boy and his dog.

Listen, Josh Wiggins is okay. I'm always impatient with surly kids, and Justin is definitely that. More, he's a borderline hooligan who's flirting with shady dealings with the local gangster, seein' as how Justin has a knack for producing bootleg video games. Thomas Haden Church and Lauren Graham play the Wincott parents, and they're solid in their old hat parts (again, the dog's better). I could've done without Justin's annoying bike pals. I definitely could've done without the re-entry of Kyle's clich-ridden best friend, Tyler (Luke Kleintank). It's Tyler's presence that triggers the action thriller stuff.

Seriously, go see this for the dog. Given, the dramatic content is Disney-vanilla. They could've done a better job, maybe a more searing job, examining the Wincott's fractured family dynamics, with Justin's long-abiding resentment stemming from his dad's favoring the other son, but also with the dad's harboring deep-seated insecurities. Instead, it's the usual tired, by-the-numbers treatment. And the gun-running sub-plot is awkwardly shoehorned in. But I love the dog, I like the girl, and Angelina County up in Texas seems like a great place to live in and grow up in. And, as much as I'd wanted more sensitive treatment of the dog's PTSD, I did feel that surge of gratification when Max got it together enough to spring back into action. And, if nothing else, this movie allows us to appreciate that over 3000 dogs have served in Iraq and Afghanistan, that dogs have been used by the U.S. military since World War One. What have you done for your country?",1470614400,,3347,4.835951134380454

7288161,5,B00ZQ36R4Y,"It had been years--decades, actually--since I'd watched a movie about a ""hero dog"" or ""a boy and his dog""; but this one was worth the wait, and I'm glad I watched it.

Other reviewers have already told you what happens in the plot, so there's no need for me to re-hash the story, and how it ends.

The movie is rated as suitable for ""Family,"" and yes, it is. In fact, I think it's especially suitable for families to watch with their children. There are times when you'll cry, and worry; but it all turns out well in the end.

One more thing: Despite the violence of some scenes, the movie's trailer, at the end of the credits, includes both the names of the animal trainers and handlers, and the screen names and real names of the dogs (including ""Max,"" whose real name is ""Carlos""--!), with the Certification that no animals were hurt in producing it. And that's an important consideration for me!

Buy this movie, or rent it; but either way, watch it, and watch it with your family. It's inspiring.",1465171200,,1001,4.483516483516484

My review has nothing to do with that. My review is on the fact that the movie was extremely child like, and unrealistic. I rented the movie based on the reviews and was shocked that it didn't even come close to living up to the hype. It's nothing close to Marley and me, so don't go in expecting that. It just felt like a hyped up disney show...not movie. I personally don't recommend the movie. There are some great documentaries that cover all that our service dogs, men, and women do for our country if you are interested...but I wouldn't use this movie to educate yourself on that. Really wish we could get our money back...that's how bad it was.",1463184000,,813,4.3202614379084965

7288411,3,B00ZQ36R4Y,"I think movies like this are important in helping people broaden their perspectives on the people and animals that serve us. The story is really good and the actors, for the most part, are amazing. I think that a more believable opportunity to develop the relationship between Max and the boy is lost by not taking advantage of the accessibility of the soldier who trained Max in the first place and instead took a whole lot of really intimate human-master-story possibilities and dumped them on a character who added absolutely NOTHING to the movie (I can't remember what her name is but she's the only person in the film I can't stand). Beyond being pointless, the girl's character diminishes the importance of the character's best friend, but I think the actions of the character are socially inappropriate--she's violent, foul-mouthed, and mean--a complete contradiction, I think, to the person she needed to be for her character to add anything to the film. She SHOULD have been (if they were going to have an outside party be involved in the boy and dog's bonding) someone who embodied the qualities the boy would have to conjure in himself to be what he and Max needed to be for each other.

This is seriously the last thing I'm going to say about the girl's character: Oh, darn, I can't say that or it would spoil something... But I can say this - at the dinner scene when she is over and a soldier is there briefly, I think what she says to him is shamefully presumptive and, by the tone she said what she said to him, could have been really hurtful and offensive. I can't imagine saying what she did to a serviceman who just said he was discharged with injury. I know what the filmmakers were trying to do, but it would have mattered more later if that moment never happened.

Honestly, the only thing that hurts the re-watchability (I know it's not a real word) of this movie is that character - everything else is really, really good. So if you like her, or end up liking her, then you should be happy with this movie.

Oh... one last thing. There are some aspects of this movie that are really formulaic for human-dog-family movies and I just tried to ignore them. If this movie had been made a little less family friendly, I think it could have been an amazing and deeply moving drama.",1457654400,,2299,4.561743341404358

If you are a dog person, you'd quickly notice even the hollywood editing technique cannot enhance the poorly executed story line.
Too obvious play sequence edited as a ""seemingly fight sequence.""
Very disappointed with using ""Rottweiler"" as a stereo-typical attack dog. (why not use the same breed to show if an owner trains them bad, they will be bad no matter what the breed is)
This is a kind of a movie that the trailer looked 100% better.
Several low budget documentary-type movies that are offered by Prime @ Amazon Video section are way better than this one.
I was quite surprised that the actor played father of the main character was skeptical of the boy's performance (in special feature).
Plus, even for the sake of a war hero canine, a military personnel would not give out classified DVD to any relative. (if you want to create a reliable yet movie-ask imagined reality, maybe he would show it to him in the building despite the eyeing of other military members but the boy recorded segments of DVD contents without a permission with his cell phone would have worked the same.

The acting was reasonably good, the dog was terrific, and there was plenty of action and comic stints to interest the kids while also the message of dedication and loyalty throughout that makes this a great pick for older-elementary age kids and beyond. Most importantly, the dog does NOT die in the movie, which would have been a real humdinger for us. Due to the nature of the story line (criminal activity) , violence (action episodes involving guns, punching, dogs fighting, and explosives) I would not recommend this for small children.",1451260800,11,742,4.8046875

7288968,4,B00ZQ36R4Y,"This is one of the better entries into the group of kids and brave dog save the day from bad guy adults and overcome parent obstacles along the way genre of films.  It's a family targeted film so it suffers (or perhaps you might view it as a positive) from the fact it is a bit formulaic and you sort of know how everything will turn out.  But the journey there is a fun one, there's some cool bike action, and the six dogs who played Max (if you get the DVD with the extra Working With Max you can learn more) do a brilliant job using each of their strengths to give us this excellent hero canine character.

Being a family/kids film, the child characters have the most screen time and all do a brilliant job.  Justin (the younger brother of a marine killed in action, who was Max's partner), is a bit of an antihero, before Max returned to the US and is forced upon his responsibility, he's not the most likable kid, he'd rather pirate video games then work for his father for a few dollars an hour.  His mother is played by Gilmore Girls' Lauren Graham, I don't know if she was intentionally supposed to be rather cardboard cutouty, maybe because her son just died and she's withdrawn into herself or something, but really they could have just got a store mannequin to play her part as she's a rather lifeless character who is more of a prop than a mother.  The father is also a bit odd, he's supposed to be this tuff ex marine who puts too much emphasis on his kids being like him, so that Justin feels he is a failure in his father's eyes because he's not like his brother or interested in the same things his father is.  But he's played by Thomas Haden Church who all I can remember him from played light comedy roles on 90's TV sitcoms such as Ned and Stacey.  He's grown a moustache since then and is now supposed to be a bad ass?  Didn't buy it, his character just came across as unlikable and gullible, he seemed to never catch onto the fact that although he lost a son, his other son also lost a brother.",1450915200,,2015,4.240208877284595

7288994,2,B00ZQ36R4Y,"Was there no animal lover or a anyone with common sense on the set, or writing the script?  This could have been a great movie.  Really eager to watch it, and although the beginning was good and a bit of a tear jerker, the rest of the story became more of a joke.  As soon as I saw that Kibbles & Bits was being used to feed a well trained military dog, I knew the story would spiral down.  When the first ingredient is corn in a dog food, that dog will not do well, but I digress.  And for goodness sakes, did anyone ever give the dog water?  Are the new owners of this dog complete idiots?  You would think that a dog that your son loved would garner a bit more respect and attention, but no.  The whole family dynamic of sullen boy and stern dad, with helpless mom was a bit much.  They could have used a cardboard cut out of the mom and just moved her around a bit, she provided no  strength to the story at all.  And I really like Lauren Graham.

Granted, I am a dog lover and expected more out of the story, but it just proved a bit too unrealistic at times. Military giving away a dog they can not control to a family that clearly has no experience with dogs.  Smart move guys.  Next time the studio should get a true dog person there to give it some semblance of reality.  I'm sure others will say that it wasn't about the dog, it was about the boy.  Yes, it was, but when you can do it the right way, or the wrong way, why choose the wrong way most of the time?",1450224000,,1470,3.982876712328767

We own two Belgian dogs so we just had to watch this. Our dogs even liked some of the movie, but then they got bored and went looking for bones. They were more into the barking scenes than the visuals. The plot and dialog are very basic and contrived here and seem mainly aimed at early teen kids.

The family of the killed son decide to save Max who was going to be put down because no one in the military branch in which he served could handle him, yet a teenager is able to handle him with little difficulty later in the story. I don't know how the military handles specially trained war dogs, but I think Max would've represented significant time, effort, training and expense and that alot more work would've been put into rehabilitating him and so I didn't find the film persuasive in that the little we are shown is all that would normally be done to help a traumatized animal. Also didn't like the standard sulky film teenage characterization of the remaining child. Wish he'd been written more interesting. Also wish he hadn't been filmed in closeup as much as he was. I think a lighter touch in terms of less emotional music would've helped me enjoy the film more. Acting is mostly fine. 2 and 1/2 stars.",1449187200,3,976,4.551136363636363
