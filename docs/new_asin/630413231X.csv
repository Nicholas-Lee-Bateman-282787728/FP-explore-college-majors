790287,5,630413231X,"Everyone settles into their characters nicely this season. Quark begins to shine more, Garek develops (but doesn't mature), Dax -is too painful to talk about in any season, Kira is less annoying -she got a lot better over the years, and everyone is somehow shadowed by Avery Brooks (Sisko). To this day, he is probably my favorite actor. After seeing him in an interview, I thought he might be controllably schizophrenic because he acted so crazy (yelling odd, non-rhyme poetry and barking at the host - making those around him look a little uncomfortable), but when he's acting it's as though he believes every word, thought and nuance of his performance. He is a stellar actor. They ALL are. Even O'Brien get's an episode here and there and pulls it off. That's what makes this show so solid, not a weak link in the chain. Production and writing through to performance. It's a great collection of stories for all ages.",1043452800,6,920,4.75625
790288,5,630413231X,"I never realized just how many DS9 fans there were out there.  I thought that I was alone amongst all the TNG fans.  TNG was great, but DS9 had a life to it's own.  It remained true to Trek, but brought new life with a whole new plot concept.
The Galaxy got bigger, but the amount of distance needed to travel for a good storyline got shorter.  If memory serves,  I really got into the show when season 2 started to conclude.  The Dominion was coming and that turned out incredible.
I'm looking forward to starting all over again with season one and then the rest as they come out.  Do yourself a favor and buy these seasons.  Support DS9.  I know I will.",1043366400,8,655,4.217741935483871
790289,4,630413231X,"Star Trek DS9: The Second Season. We're introduced to the Dominion when Quark tries to establish a Ferangi trading aggrement in the Gamma Quadrant and then the Jem'Hadar in the season ending cliffhanger. The episodes were better this year when the series seperated itself and tried to be less like The Next Generation and established its own identity. Although future seasons were better than this, a few of my favorite series episodes: notably Rivals (with The Princess Bride's Chris Sarandon) are in this season.",1043020800,5,514,5.130952380952381
790290,5,630413231X,"Here we are then with DS9 series 2. If you saw the first, and were not that impressed, don't give up. DS9 has so much to offer the viewer. The first series had trouble finding its feet, but with each series it gets better and better. This series begins to introduce elements that will continue through to the conclusion of DS9. When you have finished with this DVD you will be gagging for season 3. The best trek, just got better.",1042761600,3,430,4.320987654320987
790291,5,630413231X,"People will debate this for years to come, but in my opinion, the best Star Trek series ever started here... Deep Space Nine.
Benjamin Sisqo (Avery Brooks) plays the head of a Starfleet delegation sent to bridge relations with the Bajorians. Bajor has been under the enforced rule of the Cardassians for the past 50 years, and after winning their freedom, reluctantly accept the help of the Federation in rebuilding their society. However, the discovery of a wormhole to another sector of the galaxy changes everything.
Over the course of seven seasons, DS9 went from being the afterthought of the Star Trek universe to being the standard bearer. Well thought plotlines, and stories that had consequences made this worth the visit every week. There are weak episodes, and there are great episodes. Make sure you don't miss any.",970963200,,827,5.0
790292,5,630413231X,"The first episode(s) of Deep Space Nine provided us all with an insight into a new, darker, more violent Star Trek, Deep Space Nine. The characters  are all fully fleshed out by the end of this brilliant episode which  concentrates on the newly acquired freedom the Bajoran's now enjoy, the  Enterprise is in orbit of Bajor and protecting the planet, but when Picard  and crew are called away on an urgent mission it is left to a skeleton crew  headed by Commander Benjamin Sisko who must defend the former-Cardassian  space station, Terok Nor, from the old landloards who are on their way back  to retake what they believe to be there's...
Sisko discovers a wormhole  and the strange beings that live in it, with his untested crew on DS9 they  are the only ones who can stop the Cardassian invasion ship! Explosive!",966643200,7,816,4.690140845070423
790293,5,630413231X,"There is no question that Star Trek: Deep Space Nine was and will always be, one of the best sci-fi television shows produced.  No one but Avery Brooks could have such compassion and command for his character.  It was  not his dream to command a Space Station - just his duty.  And no one could  do it better.  Any one else and I would have just tuned-out. I enjoyed all  the characters (alien and human), but Avery's voice is mesmerizing and also  commanding.  I had no choice but to obey! and tune-in each week. (and I  never got my gold-pressed latnum.",953683200,4,555,4.405940594059406

790581,5,630413231X,"Although nearly every episode has a great & unique storyline, the ones that stand out to me are the following episodes of Season 2: ""The Wire"", ""The Jem'Hadar"", ""The Maquis: Parts 1 & 2"".  ""The Wire"" centers around the mysterious Cardassian Garak (my favorite) & a wire implanted in his brain.  This episode helps solve some of Garak's mysterious past life & I really enjoyed this one:)  'The Jem'Hadar"" introduces the militaristic, drug-controlled aliens that are the soldiers of the Dominion from the Gamma Quadrant.  Although I enjoyed this episode, it's strange to see that Vortas have psychokinesis abilities (repelling people away) in this episode, but not in future episodes.  It's still a great show worth watching:)  ""The Maquis"" episodes center around the Bajorans & Cardassians living near/within each others' territories.  The Maquis are a band of Bajorans & others fighting the Cardassians within the DMZ.  This is a great storyline continued from ST:TNG (I think).  They're both worth watching:)",1481241600,4,1009,5.25625

I especially like how the character of Odo is evolving. Even Odo prizes honesty and truth above all else, this season shows a willingness to bend the rules just a little when the cause is right. Yes, I do love the other characters in Deep Space Nine, but Odo has a special place for me and it's not just the ability to shape shift. Odo presents a view of law enforcement that is appealing in many ways; fair and yet also understanding. In addition, Odo knows the secret lives of the other characters, but has the good sense to keep them secret. Of all the Star Trek characters, I often find Odo the most interesting, despite the seeming ill-formed and incomplete characters that the writers would have you believe are present.",1467849600,3,868,4.6797385620915035

791151,3,630413231X,"With the exception of maybe half a dozen episodes in the first TWO seasons, this series has been a little disappointing to me as a big Star Trek fan.  I love the original series.  I love Voyager.  I like a lot of what I've seen of Enterprise, and of Next Generation (there are still episodes of each that I haven't seen).  But for me there's too much ""politics"" in this series so far -- again with the exception of several very good episodes.  I like stories that take advantage of the science fiction medium, at least if you're going to call them science fiction.  By contrast, a number of these episodes could have been done in other genres, as they could have taken place on earth, at any time in history or the present, and without the enjoyable trademark elements of science fiction such as high technology or aliens.  I WANT to see space travel, time travel, gadgets and monsters.  Not all the time, and certainly not without the thoughtful plots for which Star Trek is known.  But more than I've seen here so far.  I've gotten to know the characters by now, and they are not the problem; they're interesting and generally likable people who are becoming increasingly fleshed out over time.  Nor is being stuck on a space station the issue, contrary to my early concerns.  They get around enough by way of the neighborhood worm-hole, and are visited by outsiders via the same method.  It's just that I haven't cared as much about their interactions and pursuits as I would have liked.  Some of the episodes in season two (like season one) are downright tedious to me, which is a criticism I'm not accustomed to using against a Star Trek series.  But I've just finished the season and I'm moving ahead.  I have it on good authority that things get better!",1466812800,2,1760,4.557324840764331

When I saw that Mr. Brooks was to star in this series, I thought good, Hawk in space.  Compared to Hawk, Sisko was a wimp.  Once I became familiar with Sisko, I started to like him more and started to enjoy the series, but it never felt like a Star Trek product.

The show is much more character driven and less techno-babble than the other shows and that's a good thing - you can probably get your wife to watch DS9. The main characters get rotated to the forefront of certain episodes so you really get to see some good acting.

791536,3,630413231X,"Season two continued the upward trajectory of this interesting series. It was not quite Star Trek The Next Generation but it had its own vibe and as a result thrived. The second season started off with a bang. The first three part Star Trek arc that introduced us to Li Nalas, a leader of the Bajoran resistance to the Cardassians was stellar. I only wish they had not killed him off by the end of the season.

The series showed improvement but also it had problems with plausibility. For example, why was Quark not arrested or thrown off the station after betraying the station in the episode titled: Invasive Procedures?  Moreover, why is it that Quark has not hired a bodyguard? He makes enough latinum to hire an army. In the first season episode of Vortex he is threatened by a Miradorn in his own bar! In the second season he is nearly murdered in his bar by a hit man (Necessary Evil). Before that he was threatened with death by Falit Kot (Again In His Own Bar!). Odo drops the ball and does not put a security man on Kot and as a result Quark is kidnapped! In the Season three episode titled: The House of Quark, Quark is again threatened and almost killed by a drunk Klingon. Later that same episode he is kidnapped by Grilka and forced to go to Kling. A few bouncers would have helped greatly to keep the peace in his bar not to mention Quark himself! Too, I believe Quark would have armed himself after all those attempts on his life.

I'm going to list the ten best episodes of Season two. The Homecoming, The Circle, The Siege were great. Melora and Necessary Evil were interesting mysteries. Whispers, Bload Oath and The Maquis were great episodes. Tribunal and Jem Hadar were great clinchers to the second season. Most of the others were so-so episodes.

I would like to add Sanctuary as an interesting episode. However, I did not like the either or solution that the episode exhibited. It's true that Bajor would not have been able to absorb so many refugees at one time. However, they certainly could have accepted a small portion of the Skrreeans and why not more on one of Bajor's moons? It made no sense to send all of those people to Draylon II and even less sense for the Bajorans to fire on the ship. Why not allow it to land and then take the occupants into custody? The extremes were always a weakness of this show in my opinion. Although this changed somewhat as the series continued.

Rivals and Paradise were quite interesting episodes. Check out the place across the hall from Quarks that Martus Mazur opens to compete with Quark! I wish I could have been him! That Probability Device would make a man rich! Paradise was an episode I would always see advertised when I viewed Star Trek: The Next Generation. I was intrigued when I saw it. While interesting, it was not the best nor the worst episode of that season.

All in all I give this season a Three and a Half Star rating. It was better than season one but not as good as season three. I've viewed this DVD package three times and I find the continued Star Trek universe to be enthralling. I'm the 464th person to review this DVD package and the 29th to give it a Three Star review (3.5 Out Of 5 Stars). However, I still do not think DS9 is better than Star Trek: The Next Generation. Nevertheless, I recommend it for fans of Star Trek.",1455926400,,3322,4.437704918032787

791584,5,630413231X,DS9 is the best of all the Star Trek series. The building nature of the story line as opposed to the episode by episode style of the others allows better development of the storys and the characters. There is better contrast in the characters. They are not all under the same command structure makes it more fascinating than the other series and most sci-fi series.,1454716800,,365,4.630769230769231

There is dissension among the crew on occasion and the result is even more interesting and diverse.  I especially enjoy the way the crew melds together when necessary.

791934,4,630413231X,"My experience with DS9 season 1 was not very positive.  The things that bothered me were the hammy performances, inconsistent personalities of the characters, and very silly stories.  With season 2, I felt that the writers had a better handle on the characters, and created more interesting and entertaining stories.  Characters that I found grating (Sisko, Quark, and Odo) became much more likable and characters I found bland (Dax, O'Brien, Bashir) were given more to bring out their personalities and backstories.

My favorite episodes on the season were the ones that focused on character backstories, particularly characters I wasn't fond of in season 1.

-Rules of Acquisition was a great Quark/Ferengi episode
-Necessary Evil was a great Odo and Kira showcase episode
-Tribunal was a fantastic O'Brien episode that also filled in a lot of information about the Cardassians
-The Wire was a great episode that explained much about Garak
-The Jem H'adar was a very good season finale and provided great work for Sisko, Jake, & Quark

By the end of season 2, I was hooked on the series because I really felt attached to the characters and their plight.  The overarching story became more focused and we got good glimpses of the adversaries (Cardassians, The Maquis, and The Jem H'adar).",1440806400,,1289,5.05188679245283

Deep Space Nine gets up to it's full speed in season 2. That's a little faster than The Next Generation which didn't really find it's way until seasons 3 and 4. (Though DS9 aired concurrently with the later seasons of TNG, and witch much of the same production staff. So the crew knew what it was doing from the start. It just took the writers a season to figure out who their characters were)

DS9 has a lot more political inner workings than the other Trek series did. And it stays fresh by making daily life with Cardasians the main plot of the early seasons (and still an integral plot of the later seasons) but keeps it familiar to Trek fans by making political ties with the Klingons an ongoing storyline as well. The whole Klingon empire is much more explored in DS9 than in any other Trek series.

It's just a great Trek series that doesn't burn the viewer out by being the same space battles with the same aliens that Kirk and Picard faced.

Season 2 is particularly fun because it introduces the alternate universe where all the good guys and bad and vice versa. This was originally explored in The Original Series when all the bad guy versions of the Enterprise all have goatees to indicate they were bad. This is the same alternate universe and its' just as much fun. DS9 will do that every now and then, where they just have a fun episode that doesn't advance the main story arc of the series. It breaks up the monotony of the show and it's just a good time.",1430179200,3,1475,4.380952380952381

792280,5,630413231X,"DS9 surprising gritty complex story lines and character development over the seven years.  Being the first Star Trek without Gene Roddenberry at the helm, the show explores the back waters of the Federation, yet still holding true to the Star Trek 'sandbox'  I really liked the deeper exploration of  of faith, as the Federation is viewed as 'God-less', as they do not have a central single religion.  Character development shows initial adversaries becoming the best of buddies, and show us not to judge a book by its cover (and sometimes their mid-deeds <G>)
During my deployments, one of my guilty pleasures was to watch a episodes or two a night after pulling a 12 hour shift to forget the world and explore DS9.  I appreciated the show when it was on, but I caught a lot more nuances watch them night after night.",1429142400,,818,4.6923076923076925

DS9 definitely fleshes out during season two.  The characters, as always, have become far more comfortable in their roles.  The acting doesn't seem forced and the exchanges between ""friends and enemies"" has an authentic feel.

It also tied in nicely with other Trek's as Chief O'Brian and later Worf from The Next Generation were both in it,with occasional visits from the Enterprise and Admiral Janeway(Voyager).The introduction of new character species like Odo and Quark kept things fresh. They also opened up the previously unexplored Delta Quadrant,which brought with it a whole new set of adventures. It seems like you get to know the characters a little better too. For me DS9 was the best of the Trek's!",1404864000,,639,4.871559633027523

It skipped so badly it showed 3 seconds of the second episode and then halted for a two minutes before beginning again somewhere in the third. It was entirely unwatchable. I got a refund, but was told to keep the disks, so I ordered a replacement second season. Which promptly did the same thing. Again, a very nice vendor sent me a replacement, which I am, at this moment, watching skip it's way through the first disk. Three times in a row is too much. I don't think I am going to try again.

Just for the record, the same player shows every other disk I won without problem, while the defective disks show the same behavior on two different DVD players as well as a computer DVD drive. (After the second incident, I was worried that it might be my player, so I went to slightly absurd lengths to make sure it was not.)

I feel bad giving it one star, as the episodes on the other disks were pretty entertaining, but since I am rating the product, not the show itself, have to give it the single star, as I would never have bought it had I known of the headaches involved.",1387756800,,1164,4.286363636363636

Very well written and was more about the characters than warping into danger and then figuring everything out 5 minutes before the hour.

Season one was intense and the intensity grows with this second season.  The characteer developments remain true and Jake is growing up.  Since I am a father, I understand what the commander was going through with raising his son.  Quark is dispicably lovable.  Major Kira let's her hair down (for a shoprt time anyways, lol).

793521,5,630413231X,"OVERALL:  Very well done episode which is analogous to some problems we face in society where people in positions of power may not understand the reasons of certain peoples' actions because they don't understand the circumstances in the lives of those people.  It follows a ""terrorist"" group called the Maquis and how the treaty between the Federation and the Cardassian empire created a desperate situation for those people living in the demilitarized zone between the Federation and Cardassia.  In this episode Sisko must stop the Maquis from escalating violence which may lead to war.  Further drama ensues because Sisko's long time friend Calvin is implicated with the Maquis.

WHAT TO WATCH FOR:  The most memorable part of this episode is near the beginning when Sisko delivers his ""the problem is earth speech.""  Don't miss it!  It carries a lot of meaning.

MEANING FROM THE EPISODE:  Firstly, this is my interpretation and I warn you it may contain spoilers.
This two part episode centers around a group of desperate Federation citizens who are doing whatever it takes to survive.  They feel abandoned by the Federation and the Cardassians are admittedly making their lives a living hell.  So they take matters into their own hands.  Sisco delivers a great speech in this episode calling earth the problem, but analogously for us Americans you could call it rural or comfortable America.  Sisco says they (Earth) have no idea what the people in the demilitarized zone are going through and that they are simply doing what it takes to survive.  You could liken these desperate federation citizens to people who have grown up in gang/drug infested communities, or to situations like what happened in Haiti recently after the earthquake.  Often you will hear people in society pass judgment on people who have grown up in these tough environments or go through a bad situation, but all I can think is that people are people.  And just like is displayed in the classic Twilight Zone episode ""The Shelter"" (Season 3 for those who want to watch it on Amazon Prime) if you place people in a desperate situation, people often do whatever it takes to survive, regardless of how you judge them from the comfortable and protected home you reside in.  There are many accounts of Holocaust survivors which will echo the same kind of sentiment, as an example Elie Weisel does so in his well known book ""Night"".  This episode does so similarly.  It does so by showing the relationship between Sisko and Cal who both lost their wives, both are starfleet officers and both had the same aspirations when they joined starfleet.  So it somewhat establishes them as being the same person with one major difference: Cal is stationed in the demilitarized zone and Sisko is not.  Thus we could potentially conclude that if their roles were switched it might be Cal trying to stop Sisko in this episode.  This episode makes us ponder just how much our environment makes us who we are and contributes to our actions.  Something to consider the next time we go to judge another person.",1328659200,4,3067,4.876447876447877
793522,2,630413231X,"""Emissary"" is kind of a bore. It starts out with some great action sequences with Federation vessels battling the Borg from the Star Trek: Next Generation episode ""The Best of Both Worlds"" where we get to see the death of Commander Sisko's wife, but then the story jumps to the present day and we get into the main plot, and - oh boy, does it get slow from there. The only other action was at the very very end when the station comes under attack by the Cardassians. But the battle only last for a very little while before it's over. There is hardly any action in it what so ever, and most of the story deals with our main characters' past demons. Way too much drama and not enough excitement.

Since the meek progenitor of all subsequent chapters in the Star Trek universe was the ever progressive Gene Roddenberry, some of his politics do occasionally bubble to the surface, and Deep Space Nine is no exception, to the chagrin of more conservative Trekkers like myself who are looking for compelling science fiction without a political science lesson about early 20th century progressive thought. There are misguided, unethical messages that occasionally affect the watchability and entertainment value of certain episodes of this show. You can't enjoy an episode when you can hear your conscience saying ""well I wouldn't have done that...""

The story concerns the rescue of the famous leader of a Bajoran resistance cell, whose deeds are not what they are reputed to be. As a result, the man is understandably reticent about a prominent ceromonial position he has been granted by the provisional Bajoran government. What's worse, however, is Commander Sisko's advice that he keep on living the lie, as though his reputation was a factual representation of his deeds. I would not expect as much from a military officer.

That's a Sorelian myth, and it's the very same reason people like Stalin, Mussolini and even Hitler gained power...the mythos surrounding their personal deeds. A French Syndicalist, Georges Sorel, revolutionized Progressive 'thought.' According to Sorel, myths are important ways of organizing society and encouraging people to busily prepare themselves, thereby disposing people to their appointed tasks. Note the use of the word 'appointed', and not 'chosen.' It didn't matter if the 'myth' in question was a lie or an untruth. According to Sorel, myths are ""artificial combinations invented to give the appearance of reality to hopes that inspire men in their present activity.""

For those of us who are not Syndicalists or Socialists, but objective moral absolutists, following a lie, however well intentioned or beneficial, is a betrayal of good sense, of morality, of ethics, and frankly, of objective reality.

Conservatives be forewarned. DS 9 is for the most part a politcally benign, galactic thrill ride with mostly positive and laudable moral appeals. But there is no questioning the progressive credentials of the eminent Gene Roddenberry. You will occasionally be subjected to philosophies that you find morally and ethically intolerable, though such instances are rare.

I still find a way to enjoy the series, especially the eventual coming of the Dominion, the Federation-Klingon alliance, and the arrival of General Martok!",1325808000,4,2592,5.403465346534653

On the whole, I'd say that there's something worthwhile in every single episode during this season, whether it's a touch of character development or an interesting plot twist.

793774,5,630413231X,"Season 2 of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine is the first full-length season of the series.  The first one contained only 20 hours of screen time, while this one included 26.  And, it began with a three-part story arc, ""The Homecoming,"" ""The Circle"" and ""The Siege,"" in which the rescue of a legendary Bajoran nationalist from an un-liberated Cardassian labor camp coincides with a military coupe by an extremist faction on Bajor, claiming the system just for Bajorans and forcing the Federation to leave Deep Space Nine.  However, the command crew has acquired evidence that the coupe is being supplied by the Cardassians through third parties, and their objective (with the nationalist's help) is to show the proof to the faction.  It's an arc which only helps to draw the diversified crew closer together in the face of adversity.

During this season, there are multiple plot threads introduced.  Among them are the promotion of Vedek Winn to Kai over Kira's lover, Vedek Bariel, Jake Sisko's indifference to joining Starfleet when he needs to find his own path, Odo's persistent search for the origin of his people, which he believes to be on the far side of the wormhole, the Ferengi position that only males can wear clothes or earn profit, the intensity of the training program for Trill symbiosis and most significantly, the first mentioning of the dreaded imperial force of the Gamma Quadrant, the Dominion.  The Dominion is first mentioned during a voyage by Quark and his brother Rom (Max Grodenchik) into the Gamma quadrant on behalf of Grand Nagus Zek to establish business ties.  The Dominion receives mention three more times during Season 2, including a moment during Odo's search for his people.  The season finale features a first skirmish between the Federation and two genetically-engineered Dominion species, the Vorta and the Jem'Hadar, built respectively to be diplomats and fighters.  The season ends with the DS9 command crew beginning to prepare itself for a Dominion invasion.

Another significant story arc appears during this season, one which would set the stage for multiple upcoming events.  It begins with the Next Generation episode, ""Journey's End"" and comes to full fruition on this show with the 2-part episode, ""The Maquis.""  During the events of ""Journey's End,"" the Federation and Cardassians have reached a delicate peace, creating a Demilitarized Zone, redrawing the official border and ceding worlds to both sides.  When confronted with forced relocation, the settlers of former Federation worlds refuse to leave, relinquishing Federation ties and receiving a promise of welcome from the Cardassians.  During this show's 2-parter, it is revealed that the Cardassians are going back on their promise, harassing, poisoning, torturing and even killing the colonists using illegally-acquired weapons.  Having already refused to leave their homes, the colonists choose to fight back, acquiring weapons & ships of their own and eventually christening themselves the Maquis.  Despite their orders to uphold the peace, Sisko's crew doesn't become fully aware of the matter until an old friend of his, Cmdr. Calvin Hudson joins the Maquis, forsaking his Starfleet career.  One explosion, one kidnapping, several murders and a Sisko-Hudson skirmish later, the conflict between the Maquis and Cardassians in the Demilitarized Zone has lapsed into an uncomfortable standoff.  In the intervening weeks, there would be one Maquis-involved altercation for the Next Generation characters and one the DS9 characters.

The 1993-94 viewing season was the last year of Next Generation, and Star Trek: Voyager would begin midway through the following season.  Though the Maquis were created ultimately as a catalyst for the launch of Voyager and a general series plot thread, the writers felt the necessity to establish their existence during this season of Deep Space Nine and Next Generation to provide exposition for the Voyager series pilot, ""Caretaker.""  After Voyager's inception, the Maquis would play a scattered part on DS9, but the general focus would be on the conflict with the Dominion.

Personal reflection: Such a shame, because as easy as the Federation-Dominion conflict was to relate to, I for one was incredibly attracted to the Maquis story arc of the Star Trek cannon.  Though they were created for Voyager, their physical location should've given them greater significance to the Deep Space Nine saga than to Voyager (which took place thousands of light years away).  Though they were featured in such a way that the viewer was meant to frown on them, the Maquis represented an underrated Star Trek story which deserved better attention.",1313452800,,4675,5.259757738896366

793777,5,630413231X,"Bottom-Line: ""ST: DS9 ~The Complete Second Season"" takes me furthers my journey into what is proving to be one of the darkest chapters in Federation's fictional history.

The Star Trek franchise has been alive for over forty-five years and through all of the various incarnations: Star Trek (The Original Series), Star Trek The Next Generation, Star Trek Deep Space Nine, Star Trek Voyager, Star Trek: Enterprise, as well as nine motion pictures, I have been an eager and loyal fan.

When Star Trek Deep Space Nine (ST: DS9) hit the airways in 1993 I was stationed with the U.S. Navy in Hawaii.  Because if my rather unpredictable schedule I was able to see only a few episodes, principally the first season, but overall I missed most of the 7-season run of ST: DS9.  So when I found all seven seasons of the series on Amazon.com, I plotted a course and picked up The Complete First Season and then The Complete Second Season.

The Story-Line

ST: DS9 ~The Complete Second Season is entrenched in Gene Roddenberry's now multifaceted Star Trek universe.  The series was created by Rick Berman and Michael Piller and produced by Paramount Television the owners of the Star Trek franchise.

A spin-off of Star Trek: The Next Generation, ""ST: DS9 ~The Complete Second Season"" opens as the Federation settles into the Cardassian space station Terok Nor in deep space after being invited in by the planet of Bajor.  After the Bajoran people liberate themselves after a long brutal occupation by the Cardassians, the Provincial Government invites the United Federation of Planets in to command the station alongside Bajorans.  The Federation renames the station Deep Space Nine.

The series stars Avery Brooks (Spenser For Hire, A Man Called Hawk, American History X) as Commander Benjamin Sisko, the franchise's first Black commanding officer.  He is joined by the following series regulars:

o Chief Security Officer Odo (Rene Auberjonois ~ Benson, The Pirates of Dark Water, The Patriot);
o First Officer Major Kira (Nana Visitor ~ Ryan's Hope, Dark Angel, Friday the 13th);
o Lt. Bashir (Alexander Siddig ~ Syriana, 24, The Last Legion),
o Lt. Commander Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell ~ Paper Dolls, Deep Core, Becker);
o Quark (Armin Shimerman ~ Beauty and the Beast, Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Boston Legal);
o Operations Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney ~ Last of the Mohicans, Star Trek The Next Generation, Clean Break), and;
o Jake Sisko (Cirroc Lofton) Commander Sisko's son.

""ST: DS9 ~The Complete Second Season"" deals with the further exploration and increasing trade with the still largely unexplored Gamma quadrant through the (stable) artificial wormhole.  DS9 is moved out of Bajor orbit and closer to the wormhole in order to stake a claim to it.  The wormhole quickly becomes a center for exploration, interstellar trade, political maneuvering, between the Federation, the Cardassian Federation, and Bajor.

While the first season concentrated on the Bajoran people and their worship the highly evolved entities they call Prophets who created the wormhole, this season concentrates more on the interstellar intrigue and it's during this season that the word of the Dominion starts to reach Federation space.  And the Maquis, a loose-knit organization of alienated Federation colonists who resort to terrorist methods to provoke a new war between the Federation and the Cardassians are introduced in a two-episode arc towards the end of the season.

Also towards the end of ""ST: DS9 ~The Complete Second Season,"" the show get a trio nasty villains in the guise of the aforementioned Dominion (first whispered about in Rules of Acquisition): the Founders, the Vorta, and the Jem'Hadar.  ST: ""DS9 ~The Complete Second Season"" closing episode The Jem'Hadar is a powerful, intelligently written episode that reveals a lot, yet nothing at all--about the Dominion.

""ST: DS9 ~The Complete Second Season"" brings us an ambitious 26 episodes on 7 DVD discs, they include: The Homecoming, The Circle, The Siege, Invasive Procedures, Cardassians, Melora, Rules of Acquisition, Necessary Evil, Second Sight, Sanctuary, Rivals, The Alternate, Armageddon Game, Whispers, Paradise, Shadowplay, Playing God, Profit and Loss, Blood Oath, The Maquis Part I, The Maquis Part II, The Wire, Crossover, The Collaborator, Tribunal, The Jem'Hadar.

My Thoughts

ST: DS9 ~The Complete Second Season continues to build on the fine start of Season One insofar-as each story build on the other in some way shape or form.  And each episode is well written, well-acted, and this second season builds on the story-lines of the first with intriguing and engaging story-lines and characters.

In the ST: DS9 universe a large cross-section of alien creatures comes through the station, in fact almost every episode introduces us to a new race, most of which come through the wormhole.

Though there are light moments in ST: DS9 ~The Complete Second Season most of the episode explore dark material that more than other Trek series explore contemporary issues in American society at the time, including the separation of Church and State, the role of religion in the classroom, genocide, racism, loyalty, bigotry, and terrorism.  And things are about to get a whole lot dicer as the Dominion finally enters the picture in a big way during the last episode of the season (The Jem'Hadar)

ST: DS9 ~The Complete Second Season takes me furthers my journey into what is proving to be one of the darkest chapters in Federation's fictional history; the Borg aside.  Already in Sean Two the uneasy peace between Cardassia and the Federation is slowly unraveling thanks in no small part to the underhanded nature of the Cardassians and the result is a feeling of general unrest in the Alpha Quadrant.

There is little separation between Star Trek: The Next Generation and ST: DS9; both series take place during the same time period, only ST: DS9 had a bit more dark spice to offer up.  Avery Brooks has come into his own as Commander Sisko during this season and the team of actors work well together with well written story-lines written for them all.

Needless to say I can't wait for season three!",1293580800,,6162,5.094433399602385

793779,4,630413231X,"After Star Trek TOS and the later seasons of Voyager I've always enjoyed DS9 over the other series (TNG and Enterprise) and despite the unavoidable comparisons with that other great sci fi series Babylon 5 I've always thought that DS9 was different enough from JMS' excellent storyline to avoid being an outright plagiarism.
One thing that DS9 had going for it that Babylon 5 didn't was production money and so unlike the Babylon 5 dvd series, this DS9 dvd series has better special effects, a better soundtrack and overall better picture quality as well.  In contrast with the Babylon 5 series where I feel it could definitely benefit from a thorough picture restoration when they finally put it on blu-ray I found this DS9 season 2 dvd set upscales very well to 1080p when I played it on my upscalable blu-ray player. The picture quality is not blu-ray reference quality though as there are many soft and grainy picture frames like for example in the Jem Hadar episodes but the quality does improve from episode to episode and from season to season. The same holds true for the sound quality which is also pretty good unlike the Babylon 5 dvd series which I also hope will undergo intense restoration for the blu-ray release. For this reason, I am happy to stay with these standard dvds of DS9 that I already have rather than to ""upgrade"" to the blu-ray versions should they become available.

While Season 1 was about the series finding its feet, Season 2 is a vast improvement in terms of scriptwriting and storytelling and actually stands out among the better of the seven seasons.  We also get in Bloodoath a Klingon episode which prepares us well for the many more of such episodes in the future especially when Worf becomes involved from season 4 onwards.  The plastic packaging is also very attractive and robust unlike the Babylon 5 one which I actually had to superglue back together again when the disc holder came apart from the cardboard spine. Overall, this dvd set of season 2 of DS9 sports a surprisingly good clean picture and sound transfer which upscales well on blu-ray players.

I'm glad I did. DS9 is gritty and real. In TNG for example, everyone got along and there was no real conflict between the characters. DS9 offers a more realistic look at people. They get angry, fight, and even hate each other at times, but when you get down to brass tacks, they get the job at hand done regardless of how they feel about each other.

793846,3,630413231X,"The second season of STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE 9 is a great improvement over the first. Its two-hour season premiere about a menacing political conspiracy might lack the vast range of later seasons, but it helps establish the new, darker atmosphere that would distinguish this from other Star Trek franchaises. ""Whispers"" seems at first a simple retread of the old Star Trek TNG episode ""The Game"", but ends with a fantastic twist that you'll never see coming. With the finale, we're finally introduced to the stable plot of warfare in the Gamma Quadrant that would be this show's distinctive niche.

While I enjoyed these episodes unquestioningly in childhood, I am aghast at how hammy the acting can be in the case of alien characters -- it's not terribly great television when exotic species seem not only just like humans, but like West Coast Americans of the time. One can accept that Star Trek is basically any other television drama or adventure show set in space, when the acting is good. But when the acting is bad, the entire enterprise seems risible. Still, season two proved much less of a struggle than season one, so my impression of it is rather more positive.",1265328000,2,1171,4.797029702970297
793847,5,630413231X,"In my mind I pair Seasons One and Two and then Seasons Three through Seven.  I enjoyed both the first two seasons and both are thoroughly enjoyable.  The series got a whole lot better after these two seasons, but that isn't at all to suggest that these are not good.  They are and had the next five seasons been only as good as these first two it would have gone down as a very good series, but it was the final seasons that really put the series on the TV SF map and made it, in my opinion, the best of the STAR TREK franchise.

Although it did not develop yet the story arcs that would dominate the show in future seasons, the show nonetheless improved through a deepening of character development and a number of fascinating episodes.  There are a lot of people who feel that the nineties was the finest decade ever for TV SF (and based on sheer numbers I think that may be true, if you include FARSCAPE, which started in 1999, and such non-space SF shows like THE X-FILES).  Certainly among the top SF series of the nineties, DS9 is near the top.  While this decade has seen some great SF -- in particular BATTLESTAR GALACTICA -- one can only hope that we will someday see the sheer quantity that we saw with DS9, FARSCAPE, BABYLON 5, ST:THE NEXT GENERATION, SPACE: ABOVE AND BEYOND, STAGATE SG-1, STAR TREK VOYAGER, THE X-FILES, EARTH 2, and ROSWELL.  There has been a great deal of SF in this decade, but most of it has been of the non-outer space kind.  Unfortunately, with the towering exception of BSG, too much of the outer space SF has either been merely a carry over of nineties shows, spin offs of those shows, tragically cancelled way too soon (FIREFLY), or of unbelievably low quality (how did ANDROMEDA last so long?).  Wouldn't it be wonderful to see a new space opera on TV?  I'm loving STARGATE UNIVERSE, but it is a spin off.  I'd really love to see something something entirely original.  AMC is exploring the possibility of a TV adaptation of Kim Stanley Robinson's great Mars Trilogy.  As it stand right now, however, the only space opera is STARGATE UNIVERSE.  CAPRICA looks like it will be a splendid BSG prequel, but it isn't clear that it isn't going to have any outer space elements at all.

After watching the first two seasons I've moved right into Season Three.  As good as the first two seasons are, it really gets better once, as they say, the plot thickens.  Frankly, I had forgotten how good this was.  It is always great when you remember something as being good, but when you rewatch it, you discover that it is even better than you remembered.",1257465600,,2581,4.464818763326226

I would beg to differ - while the series would continue to get better throughout its run, the 2nd season was excellent and comfortable matches in quality TNG's best.

The first 18 episodes are somewhat erratic - you get some classics like the ""Homecoming/The Circle/The Siege"" opener, ""Necessary Evil"" and ""Whispers""; some high quality semi-filler like ""Cardassians"", ""Invasive Procedures"", ""Armageddon"" and ""Paradise""; and then dull nonsense like ""Melora"".

Then, the last 8 episodes starting with ""Blood Oath"" are an incredibly strong stretch, which really showcases how good the series had become by this point.  ""The Jem'Hadar"" launches the Dominion arc, but many of the show's other threads get their start here.

793937,5,630413231X,"Gone are the good old days of TOS and TNG, where exploration was at the heart of everyone's mind in a somewhat lighthearted felt adventure.  Thus begins Deep Space Nine, an almost controversial series among fans, where the story is taken seriously and politcal events become more important than exploration, set in a remote and dark station.  Despite it all, Deep Space Nine was a huge success and well known as ""The greatest undsicovered series on television"".  Emissary is where it all begins, a wonderful pilot episode that digs a little deeper than any other Star Trek series pilot.

If you can handle the struggling acting (and its not that uncomon for the first season of a new television series), Emissary is just all around wonderful.  The very beginning is gripping, pitting Commander Benjamin Sisko in the middle of Wolf 359 - the horiffic event where Captain Picard was briefly the leader of the Borg cube that destroyed every starship in battle.  Although Sisko and his son escape, Sisko's wife Jennifer was not so lucky. Three years later, the Commander is ordered to take command of a Caradassian station orbiting Bajor, and finds himself again in the presence of Picard.  The memories haunt Sisko, as does his new role as commander of the station, and soon to be Emissary of the Bajoran prophets.

With the exceptions of the beginning and end, this is not an action packed episode, but has a very important story that sets a strong tone for what is yet to come in the series.  We get to meet all the main charcaters as well as their differences, and those differences that will not make it the easiest task of working together.  The Cardassians and Bajorans are both given significant roles, which finally gives Trekkies a chance to learn more about other races than the Klingons and Romulans.  But perhaps the biggest change of all is the absence of a starship in a Trek series, and replaced with a bulky station.  A sad truth at first, but very fitting for the events and story surrounding it.

On a depeer note, I really enjoyed where the story went with Sisko becoming the Emissary.  The story dives into the spirituality of the Bajoran race, and Sisko's explanation to the prophets on what it means to be human and to live in linear time gave me personal insight on the same manner.  It was a nice reminder of who we are and what we live for.

Emissary is a wonderful pilot, unfortunately, to a rather weak season.  Easily the least exciting season of DS9, it will eventually translate into a lot of excitement.  But for now, Emissary is a great opener for what is to come.

793938,4,630413231X,"My initial reaction to Season 2 of DS9 was, ""When are we going get to the Dominion?"" This can make one view Season 2 somewhat impatiently. When you sit back and just enjoy it for what it is, you might learn something. But what is it. Well, it starts off nicely with a three-parter concerning the recovery of a famous Bajoran freedom fighter Li Nalas (who seems bored as hell to be on the show, always seeming tired and crossing his arms) but there are rather interesting episodes that draw a clearer portrait of some of the many colorful characters on the show. Profit and Loss as well as the Rules of Acquisition help you understand Quark and Ferengi better, (not to mention Garak for the former) and The Wire (considered by Andrew Robinson to be his favorite episode) reveals more and confuses viewers about who Garak really was before Exile. Invasive Procedures and Blood Oath shed more light on Dax and Trills. Personally, I really liked Whispers which questions the nature of O'Brien's sanity. It was much better than Tribunal anyway. I was really touched by Odo's relationship with the little girl in Shadowplay which also features an amusing subplot about Kira, Bareil and Quark as well as father-son subplot in which Jake's future starts to take shape. Collaborator is well worth viewing as well. Melora, Rivals, Paradise and Playing God are not recommended.",1195430400,,1366,4.817021276595745
793939,5,630413231X,"The Star Trek Collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series DVD Collections (The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager and Enterprise). At around 880 minutes, it is 4 episodes (1 Disc) less than TNG, and at least 2 Discs less than TOS. However in total, for the definitive, Star Trek collection, we are still looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing. That is 1 month of non-stop Star Trek. No DVD series comes remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years. By the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years. It is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also. Our very planet, Earth, has advanced because of Gene Roddenberry's admirable concept. Roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too. `The Bridge' members are like our family. Watch what they do. Then go and spend your life striving for the same on Earth. What engineer, medic, scientist, teacher, worker can not say that Star Trek has not influenced them? The show is this significant in the development of our species. Even Christians respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why. The DVD case may be the best of the lot. The shadowy design is foreboding of a darker trek inside. The case opens to reveal the 6 discs and a collectors' DVD-ROM of a section of a model graphic of DS9 (collect all complete the computer model). The discs are held in an open (no cardboard covering) plastic flip holder like in the TOS seasons. There are 4 episodes per disc. However the last disc, disc 6 is devoted to Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras...and then some more. The episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed, but in the sequence that they aired, however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in. This means on one disc you have shows 4, 2, 12 and 1, in that order. The sound has also been remastered to 5:1 Dolby Digital! Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.

Star Trek, Deep Space Nine (DS9), Season two bridges the gap between Bajorans and Cardassians by creating more episodes where they both work together in helping the federation to defeat some evil force. The same crew is back. DS9 is commanded by Benjamin Sisko. Jake Sisko is his son. The mysterious Odo, who does not know what species he is, is the station's metamorphosing police constable and a Bajoran operative. Doctor Bashir is the Starfleet doctor and Chief O'Brien is chief engineer. Quark is a Ferengi host who owns a casino and bar. Major Kira is Sisko's first in command, and a Bajoran. Lt. Commander Jadzia Dax is a Trill woman (and a long term friend of Sisko) assigned by Starfleet as technical advisor. Gul Dukat is a leading Cardassian. The new addition is the spy Cardassian Garak.

Season Two of DS9 is mostly about war, terrorism, trills, orphans, gravity, female Ferengis, unsolved murders, phantasms, moving colonies, swindlers, odo's origins, weapons of mass destruction, delusions, holograms, micro-universe, love, revenge, neurological implants, alternative realities, traitors, kangaroo courts and the Jem'hader.

Best episodes are Rules of Acquisition, The Alternate, Paradise, Shadowplay, The Wire and The Jem'Hadar. DS9 Season two may not be the best of the DS9 seasons but it does have some interesting episodes and it is more of a build-up to the new threat of the Dominion and the Jem'hader. By the end of Season two you will be expecting that war looms on the other side of the wormhole but for that you will have to wait for Season three.",1185926400,,3878,4.70839469808542

Firstly, this season starts doing some really interesting things, twist endings, exploration of more interesting cultures in the gamma quadrant, and the introduction of the dominion.  Further, the show starts to show some real development of the characters.  This show is certainly no star trek the next generation, but in many ways that is a very good thing.  Trying to be a more of a poltical show, with religious allegories, and such is something more akin to the original show.  I like the flow of the show.  That being said, there is still more room to grow.  The great episodes for the most part are the non continiuty episodes (those not involving bajor religion or the dominion).  Many of the stand alone episdoes are far better written and acted.  However, the last episode really begins to show that there is more to come, and far more interesting things in store.

793942,5,630413231X,"Season 2 of DS9 opened with Star Trek's first ever 3 episode story, a nicely done story of politics and religion and the clashing of cultures.  One of DS9's arcs overall is Bajor's petition to join the Federation and this 3 episode story is a big hurdle for them to overcome on that process.

The first steps are taken toward the Dominion arc that would carry most of this series.  Cleverly, the first mention of the Dominion comes in a comedic Ferengi themed episode called ""Rules of Acquisition.""  They're then hinted at again in ""Sanctuary"" and ""Shadowplay"" before coming out in full force in the season finale ""The Jem'Hadar.""

The season is not without it's poorer episodes.  ""Second Sight"" is proably my least favorite episode of the series.  ""The Alternate"" and ""Profit and Loss"" are similarly uninteresting.  But there are many more great episodes.  Dax comes into her own in ""Blood Oath"" an episode that also features 3 Klingons from the original Star Trek series.  Bashir and Garak have great development in ""Cardassians"" and even more in ""The Wire.""  ""Necessary Evil"" is one of Kira's (and Odo's) best episodes, on par with season one's masterpiece ""Duet.""  O'Brien is sent through hell and back again in ""Whispers"" and ""Tribunal,"" the later also being my favorite courtroom episode in Star Trek.  ""Crossover"" marks DS9's first journey into the Mirror Universe first seen in the original Star Trek.  ""The Collaborator"" brings the Bajor story to a new level of conflict.  ""The Maquis"" 2 parter helps set up both a great arc for later seasons of DS9 and provides the premise for the upcoming series Star Trek Voyager.  And ""The Jem'Hadar"" provides a fantastic climax to the season promising a very serious conflict in the future.

While Season 1 introduced the characters and the story potential and laid some of the groundwork for what was to come, season 2 refined it and really paved the way and set it on its course.",1179792000,,1929,4.8323170731707314

Bajor in a lot of ways reminds me of Afgan/Iraq.  Just like the Afganistan fighting off the Russians, Bajor has been fighting off the cardasians.  Iraq had been ruled by the strong arm of Sadaam.  Then the Cardassians left Bajor and the Federation moved in.  In these episodes a terrorist groups called The Circle (an extremist group similar to islamic fundamentalist) is trying to come to power.  They paint the federation as invaders wanting to hold control of Bajor.  Without going into much more detail, these three episodes show an amazing amount of depth, intrique, and action.

Characters were more fleshed out, relationships became stronger and more developed, and above all the introduction of Star Trek's best villain since the Borg:  the Jem'Hadar.  I also enjoyed the political and religious sub-plots that wove their way through most of this season.  Of those episodes, The Collaborator was by far the best.  Louise Fletcher as Vedek/Kai Winn and Philip Anglim as Vedek Bareil were excellent in their roles.  I know some did not like this aspect of the show, but I always thought the writers' excellent development of the Bajorans over the life of the show was one of the things that made DS9 so good.

This season also introduced the Maquis, again one of the better creations in the Star Trek universe.  The two episodes featuring the Maquis during this season were not that great, but over time the writers developed them into an interesting group for which you sometimes felt empathy.  And of course we have to mention the Dark Universe episode, Crossover.  The Dark Universe comes from the Classic Star Trek series, but you have to give credit to the DS9 writers and producers.  They took a near 30-year-old idea and developed a much more interesting Universe.  In addition to Crossover, season two featured homage to Classic Trek with the Klingon-centered episode, Blood Oath.  This was a great Jadzia Dax episode and gave viewers the return of three Classic Trek characters and actors:  Michael Ansara as Kang, William Campbell as Koloth, and John Colicos (the original Battlestar Galactica Baltar) as Kor.

794041,5,630413231X,"Nominated for 28 Emmys, including several for Outstanding Visual Effects, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine continues the rich tradition of the original 1960s Star Trek franchise. Created by former L.A. police officer Gene Roddenberry, the Star Trek TV series morphed into a franchise famous for the unprecedented fanatical devotion of its audience. Lasting only three seasons during its original network run, Star Trek struck gold with its syndicated reruns, launching a number of motion pictures featuring the original cast as well as novels, comic books, collectibles, and reams of Star Trek-related memorabilia. Following on the heels of Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987), the first Star Trek series spin-off of the original, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine foreshadowed additional spin-offs - Star Trek: Voyager (1995), and Star Trek: Enterprise (2001). Sporting an entirely new cast and crew from its two predecessors, the show focuses on a particular system administered by the Federation instead of the usual Star Trek mission of ""exploring strange new worlds""...

Star Trek: Deep Space Nine follows the exploits of the Starfleet crew aboard an abandoned and gutted Cardassian space station orbiting the planet of Bajor. In the aftermath of Cardassian occupation, the Bajorian government invited the Starfleet to oversee the reconstruction of the space station. Deep Space Nine quickly transformed into a teeming city of commerce and a hub for travel (similar to Babylon 5) thanks to the discovery of an unknown wormhole nearby. But the wormhole leads to the Gamma Quadrant, realm of the feared Dominion alliance, which views the wormhole travelers as a threat to its totalitarian grip on power. As such, the Dominion launches an attack against the Federation and its Klingon allies. The subsequent and ongoing war is the basis for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine...

Capt. Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) is credited with discovering the wormhole, and he oversees the crew of Deep Space Nine as they wage battle to preserve the Federation. Ironically, his colleague, Constable Odo (Rene Auberjonois), is a Changeling - an alien race of ""shapeshifters"" who lead the Dominion's united front. Together with the rest of the crew aboard Deep Space Nine, they struggle with internal and external conflicts that threaten to destroy their very way of life...

The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (Season 2) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""The Homecoming"" in which, in an attempt to bring peace to the warring factions of the Bajorian people, Miles and Kira make a bold attempt to rescue a revered Bajorian resistance figure from a Cardassian slave labor camp... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""Second Sight"" in which Ben falls in love for the first time since his wife passed away, and ""The Wire"" in which Dr. Bashir attempts to cure Garak of a strange affliction...

794101,4,630413231X,"At the height of Star Trek popularity the producers of the show created a spin off about a man who'd lost his wife, and was assigned to command the recently wrestled from Cardassian control Terok Nor (Renamed Deep Space Nine by the Federation of Planets). His name, Benjamin Sisko... And he didn't want to be there. Regardless, being the good soldier that he is he takes his son and relocates to the station where he meets the moody Kira Nyrese, the shape shifting Odo, the scheming Quark, and a reincarnation (sort of) of his old friend Dax.
 What I love about Deep Space Nine is that it removed the cowboy diplomacy of previous installments. The crew of DS9 was stationary, and had to deal with the consequences of their actions, unlike Kirk and Picard who could just fly off to the next planet, Sisko was stuck dealing with the problems that were created.
 Season 2 does not delve into the Dominion much, but begins to hint at their existence, in introduces us to their minions, the Jem'Haddar. There's a lot to love about this season as the foreshadows of the future that's still somewhat fresh on everyone's mind begins here. We learn a lot of interesting things about the characters, and they continue to develop incredibly well.
 Because DS9 developed its characters so well it is, in my mind, the best of the treks. I am grateful to Paramont for these box sets, though I do feel they are awefully expensive (Fox's 24 in contrast runs about $50-60 a set). A price drop would be nice, but as of now I'm only two seasons short of the collection. Deep Space Nine is TV as it should be. Great stories with great role models for our kids, episodes that are completely inoffensive, and completely entertaining. I wish DS9 had never ended. Of all of the TV shows I love that are now gone I miss DS9 the most.",1105920000,,1808,4.522935779816514
794102,4,630413231X,"Aside from such clunkers as ""Melora"" (with the exception of that beautiful flying love scene but will poor Dr. Bashir ever get a romance that doesn't make us wince?), this is TV a cut above the average, from the introduction of the Dominion all the way back to the beginning and the introduction of The Circle and Bajoran intrigues.  Kira Nerys shines in such episodes as ""The Collaborator"" and ""Necessary Evil,"" also ""Crossover"" in which the evil Intendant (Kira's mirror-twin) is at her best and sexiest.  The standout Bashir episode is ""The Wire,"" which gives Siddig El Fadil (now Alexander Siddig) the chance to flex his acting muscles beyond ""They are the ambassadors of unhappy!""

The three-part opener always deserves to be seen back-to-back (like the six-part war arc opener in Season 6), so thank goodness for DVD.",1098835200,,823,4.949275362318841
794103,4,630413231X,"I should note that I am somewhat biased as I consider DS9 my favorite of the Trek franchise. It's great to see how the characters are developed in Season 2 and how comfortable the actors are in their roles. I especially like the development of Garak. The diverse range of stories ranging from the Maquis to a Klingon blood oath made for great stories, but the most interesting development was in the season finale with the introduction of the Jem Hadar.

I really enjoyed the extras, especially the crew dossier with Terry Farrel.

As a side note, I'm thankful for one of the reviews regarding the Asian import versions. I was sorely tempted to save a few $$$ and go with the imports, but am now glad that I paid for the US version!",1098230400,,732,4.455223880597015
794104,4,630413231X,"The second season of DS9 is much like the first. The exterior box is the same, and the disks sit in the same booklet format. I do have to wonder who chose the accent colours for the seasons. The first box set had red as an accent colour. This time we have a sickly green colour. At least the Next Generation box sets had a rainbow affect.
 The disks for season two are much the same as the first season: 4 episodes per disk, no previews. The chapters are still messed up as well. The episodes themselves are interesting, but each episode deserves it's own review, to touch on them all here would be too time consuming",1081036800,,617,4.273504273504273

MESSAGE SENT BY: INTENDANT KIRA, FIRST OFFICER GARAK, CAPTAINS SISKO AND BASHIR, MISTRESS DAX, SMILEY O'BRIEN AND OVERSEER ODO.
MESSAGE:
Welcome to the second season of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine!. This message was sent to our universe by the Deep Space Nine's Senior Staff counterparts to remind us to watch ""Crossover,"" the 22nd episode of the season, which is the most devastating episode since ""Mirror, Mirror."" The Galactic Empire has collapsed, no longer able to punish and dominate all life in the galaxy. Since Captain Picard and the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise-D were thrown into this universe and defeated the counterpart crew, the Empire's members have been slaves to the evil Klingon-Cardassian Alliance. Plus 25 episodes more!.
The Second Season of Deep Space Nine was starting to warm up, getting better with the storylines and the characters. The six best episodes of the second season of the show are:
""The Homecoming,"" ""The Circle,"" ""The Siege""- The three-part trilogy was basic information of tension on the Bajoran homeworld.
""The Maquis, Part I,"" ""The Maquis, Part II""- the two-part episode had the Federation renegades (last seen in TNG's ""Preemptive Strike"") bent on bringing the Federation and the Cardassians into a war with each other.
""Crossover""-In taking us back to the classic Mirror Universe, ""Crossover"" serves as another skillful tip of the hat to the Original Series. It also ended up working so well on its own that it spawned a multi-season story arc for DS9. As with the Original Series' ""Mirror, Mirror,"" there is much enjoyment to be derived from observing twisted doppelganger versions of our favorite characters. In particular, Nana Visitor has a ball creating Kira's evil, leather-clad double, the Intendant, who takes a decidedly narcissistic interest in our own Kira. Also fascinating: Sisko's flashy, scoundrel of a double, the beaten down ""Smiley"" O'Brien and the sadistic, human-hating version of Odo. That Odo is killed by our Bashir, exploding into a million pieces.",1071273600,3,2089,5.2388059701492535
794108,4,630413231X,"Building on the success of season ones finale, the producers and writers seemed to understand that this show was going to be much different than what came before. And despite some fan irritation that this was bad Trek because everyone came to them instead of the crew going ""where no one has gone before"", they seemed to generally ignore them. So much for the good.
Season two launches with an ambitious 3-part story (""The Homecoming"", ""The Circle"" and ""The Siege""), as Sisko and his team reluctantly become more involved with the politics of Bajor.
It was also the season that the series would begin to lose some of its episodic roots, as the show slowly began to add continuing story lines and recurring characters. It would also introduce us -through a comedic Ferengi episode ""Rules of Acquisition"" - to the concept of The Dominion, a great power in the Gamma Quadrant. They would be mentioned again in ""Sanctuary"" and ""Shadowplay"".
Season two -while still having problems -did shine on several occasions, with episodes like ""Cardassians"", ""Necessary Evil"", ""Armageddon Game"", ""Whispers"", ""Paradise"", ""Blood Oath"", ""The Maquis, parts 1 and 2"", ""Crossover"" (a sequel of sorts the TOS episode ""Mirror, Mirror"") and the ""Jem'Hadar"", which fully introduced the Dominion and there genetically engineered stormtroopers, the Jem'Hadar.

The introduction of Dominion was done subtly, and that's what made their rise to be so much better than the in your face Borg. And while season two struggles to balance the stories so they appealed to everyone, you felt and saw that below the surface, there were stories that were not going to resolved in one hour.
And as the season concluded, we were left with a portentous warning, as Eris warns the crew...""you have no idea what has begun here.""",1068768000,4,1783,5.023648648648648
794109,3,630413231X,"The second season of Deep Space Nine is where things start to get a little bit interesting.  The focus of the stories appeared on first glance to be about the Bajoran/Cardassian situation (when they were about anything at all), but slight mentions of the Dominion also begin to crop up this season.  The show still doesn't quite seem to know where it wants to go yet, although it has a lot of interesting directions it could turn.
We hear small hints during the course of this year that will eventually have great impact upon the development of the series.  A number of the hints are subtle indeed: who would have guessed that the fearsome Dominion would have been first mentioned in an apparently throwaway and goofy Ferengi episode?  I vaguely remember watching the series at the time of original broadcast and those hints went utterly over my head.  I don't remember them at all.  It's very interesting to go back now with the benefit of hindsight and see what the Creators were showing us.  Some of the references and plot lines are so vague as to be almost non-existent.  It would be fascinating to know which strands were placed in the story-arc with a definite plan in mind, and which ones were thrown in there just to see if the audience would react favorably.
Uber-story aside, how are the individual episodes themselves this season?  Well, as with the first season it's a bit of a mixed bag.  The characters are developing nicely (we see the O'Brien and Bashir working relationship moves towards a direction that would be described a season later as O'Brien ""not hating"" Bashir any more), but the stories that they're placed in do not always shine.  There are some gems, of course, and some flops, but overall, I'd describe this season as solid.  Not terrific or horrible, but good.
The DVD extras on this set are geared towards (surprise, surprise) the second season of Deep Space Nine.  As with the previous season's DVD package, we get an in-depth look at the alien creatures' makeup and costuming.  There is also a short feature focusing on the character of Jadzia Dax consisting of interviews with the actress, the writers and producers.  As with the previous season, this DVD set features some ""hidden"" interviews that aren't very well hidden.  The extras are decent, but not extraordinary; I can't imagine anyone buying the whole box-set just for the short documentaries included.
The season closer is particularly strong.  It takes some of the seemingly minor threads that have been running through the course of the year and suddenly throws a curveball at the viewer in the form of the Jem'Hadar, the Dominion's stormtroopers.  The season ends on a particularly chilling note.  Bring on season three!",1068163200,6,2719,4.833693304535637
794190,5,630413231X,"The series started off well in the first season, and continued that slow progression in the second. More or less, there was a seeming station-keeping feel to this season. TNG was coming to an end, and it seemed that the producers were all focusing their energies there. Many good episodes are to be had here, but they were still a season away from hitting their stride.
Again, Paramount has done a nice job of packaging this set. The extras a great. Although why they feel the need for a copyright proclaimation after EVERY SINGLE EXTRA is beyond me. Plus, it would be nice if they would either give the option of continuous play of the episodes, or at least put a chapter stop after the opening credits so that they could be skipped each time.",1064534400,2,744,4.518518518518518
794191,4,630413231X,"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine was groundbreaking in its first season. It was dark, but a good dark and not the negative kind of dark the producers don't take kindly to in interview after interview. To contrast the dark it was also the most cleverly funny and humurous as well. It stretched the Star Trek universe by bending its rules, its atmospheres and its characters. Season 2 did little different in its approach. In some ways, Season 2 is slightly, if just a tad, bit better than season 1 and that is usually expected. There is only one gripe...the extension of the main story. Season 2 seemed to be strecthing down the same road for most of the season except for very intelligent and low-key mentions of the Dominion and the in-your-face-forget-what-Star-Trek-was-before-eat-this-for-a-change-storyline in ""The Jem'Hadar"". The episodes were well produced and acted exceptionally and I can't complain that they were excellent hours of television but half way through the second season I found myself saying, haven't I seen this before. (Maybe Enterprise should pick up on that question!) However, amid some of that a few episodes popped up that made me realize that Deep Space Nine is not just science fiction in the Star Trek realm but science fiction in the realm of our reality. Spaceships and aliens are just background features next to the examinations of our souls as friends and lovers and workers.
  A few episodes stood out for me in the first season and they were Progress, Dramatis Personae, and Duet. Each of these episodes exemplified the human condition when thrown into conflict with moving on (Progress), the absence of control (Dramatis...) and when confronted with the Hitler of our generation (Duet). Though Season 2 trudged some of the path of season 1's less character driven episodes the episodes titled Armageddon Game (my fav of the season), Necessary Evil, The Wire, and the Collaborator all stood out above all the others, even ""The Jem'Hadar"". Each of these episodes show the extent the human condition and character development the show would specialize in later in its run.  The great thing about the The Wire and Collaborator is that the plot is centered around semi-regulars (Garak and Bareil). Deep Space Nine went out of its way to create more than just 7 or 8 solid characters. It created well over 30 that you love to see again and again. Dukat, Rom, Nog, Martok...the list could go on.
  The gripe I have with the DVD is the lack of change from season 1 to 2 (and so on all the way up to 4, so far). The interview with Nana Visitor in the first season set was engaging and interesting and the other special features were intriguing but short. The season 2 special features are at times even shorter and the interview with Terry Farrell was almost unwatchable because of its excessive use of footage from the show and not enough content from the interviewee. Other than that the Section 31 files are always a treat and this is a recommended buy!",1061596800,6,2982,4.81640625
794192,4,630413231X,"It was during the second season where things came into play that would effect the series.  The mention and eventual appearence of the Dominion, the Maquis, Winn becomes Kai, continuing conflicts with the Cardassians.
Highlights:
Rules of Acquisition:  This was a really funny episode with the first look at a female Ferengi, and the first mention of the Dominion.
Rivals:  THis was entertaining even if it was not overly popular.
The Maquis Part I and II:  A two parter about a Terrorist organization working against the Cardassians.  Sisko fights a dear friend and is at loggerheads with Dukat.
The Wire:  A really good Garak Show.  Talks about Garak's back story including his days in the Obsidian order, his relationship to Enabran Tain, and his exile
Crossover:  DS9 revisits the classic parallel universe.  Humans are subservient and Kira is evil.  This was a dark and yet a very entertaining episode.
THe Jem Hadar:  The seeds of conflict are sewn here. Sisko is taken prisoner by the Dominion and the crew has to get him back.  While this is not when the war starts, this is where it is declared.  The fact that the Dominion destroys a Galaxy class ship shows how powerful they are.",1059782400,,1189,4.798029556650246
794193,3,630413231X,"EMISSARY suffers from a lot of the flaws that have plagued Star Trek spin-off pilots, although I think it has so far been the most successful.  This, however, isn't saying much; I've found most of those pilots to be dull, boring, and/or incoherent.  The Deep Space Nine pilot wasn't as bad as all that, though I hated it when I watched the initial airing.  Re-watching it again recently with the benefit of hindsight, I found I appreciated it much more.  It's still not exactly terrific, but it does do everything that one expects from a first episode while still managing to tell a story.
The problems that face Star Trek pilots are usually the same ones that crop up every five years or so (whenever Paramount decides to launch another moneymaker).  ""We need to introduce the characters,"" I imagine the suits saying, ""We need to introduce the setting; we need to introduce the political undertones; we'd like to give the major characters a backstory; we'd like to drop some hints about storylines that we'll be following up on in the future; we'll need to populate the immediate area with some convincing bad guys; we'll want to explore the religious aspects of the indigenous people; we'll want to introduce some amazingly advanced alien creatures that humans are encountering for the first time; and we'll want an extended cameo from a star of the previous series.  Oh, and yeah, we'll want some kind of a story in there too, okay?""
For everything that it's trying to do, I think EMISSARY mostly succeeds.  The story itself is relatively simple, and revolves around introducing Ben Sisko (and the audience) to his new setting, his new command, and the various plot strands that will be cropping up in the future.  The introduction of the characters is mostly handled well, although there are a few clumsy moments, and a lot of the people and their makeup don't appear to be quite in their regular form yet.  I like the fact that the episode neatly subverts itself.  The set up begins with this station being the backwater of the universe (influencing the decisions of more than one character), but by the end this has been completely reversed.
The pilot also contains a few examples of the sort of thing that I really dislike about Star Trek Series That Do Not Star William Shatner.  I am talking about, of course, the reliance on technobabble and the ability of the crew to come up with miraculous solutions to problems in no time at all.  Fortunately, there aren't too many examples of this on display here.  Unfortunately, the two that spring to mind are particularly poor.  The first is that Dax is able to totally redesign the way the laws of physics work, and throws out this observation as if she's giving advice about which wine goes with a particular kind of fish.  In order to make the station's thrusters move the ship faster, she figures a way of lowering the mass of the object, therefore requiring less energy to push it.  The question that immediately comes to mind is: if lowering the mass of something is so easy, why on Earth isn't this standard operating procedure for all forms of transportation?  Do Starfleet care as little for fuel efficiency standards as the U.S. government does?
The other piece of ""instant brilliance"" is the fact that O'Brien manages to boost the power of the station's phasers with almost no effort on his part at all.  Truly amazing.  I can just imagine thousands of Federation scientists working around the clock, trying to think of a way to increase the efficiency of their government's phasers, only to be beaten to the punch by Miles O'Brien after two whole seconds of thought.
There are some nice touches that rescue this episode from being a plodding introduction that one must get through in order to understand the series.  Sisko's discussion and explanations concerning ""linear time"" are quite interesting, although the first time I saw this, I thought that the story violated its own internal logic, and nothing that I saw on my second viewing convinced me that I was wrong (how could he teach the concept of linear time to beings that exist outside of it, when surely they would be stateless creatures and could only either already know of linear time, or could never know of linear time?).  I liked the aliens living in the wormhole, even if they fall prey to many Star Trek stereotypes (alien beings that are so highly advanced that they act and talk like complete idiots).  The characters only have one episode to establish themselves, but in that time I already find them much more interesting than the entirety of the Next Generation crew.  The setting is again more intriguing than that of the previous series, and really makes the show feel that there is a lot of potential for conflict here.  A rough start, but not a bad one.",1059177600,,4795,4.735576923076923

794196,5,630413231X,"DS9 season two turned out many of the series greatest episodes and at the same time started to give ominous signs that portended what was to come with this outstanding and spectacular Star Trek series.  The producers, while entrenched in the final season of Star Trek The Next Generation, preproduction on Star Trek Generations and preproduction on Star Trek Voyager brilliantly were able to write and produce one outstanding episode of Deep Space Nine after another.  The second season is where the producers and everybody involved found their stride with the series resulting in absolutely amazing character interactions where everybody worked well off of one another.  Of the many Star Trek variants, DS9 I believe as a whole is dramatically the most compelling due to its very nature of conflict between the main characters.  It was truly fun watching DS9's first season, STNG's sixth season and then DS9's second season and STNG's seventh season all in the order they were originally aired, just as it was when they were all aired.  It is too bad we won't initially be able to do that with DS9 & Voyager since we won't be seeing those sets until sometime next year.  Of all the series that have passed, this is the one that I miss the most.
A brief synopsis of some of the ""stand out"" episodes of this great season:
The Homecoming, The Circle and The Siege - What can one say when they're treated to such an outstanding, well written and performed trilogy to begin a season of Star Trek, amazing!  The thought process that went into this trilogy is well played out on the screen as our beloved characters find themselves deeply entrenched in the political situation on Bajor after Kira receives evidence of a famous Bajoran freedom fighter named Li Nalas still being held by the Cardassians.  This is where we first meet Vedek Winn and learn of her ambition to become the next Kai and the lengths in which she'll go to attain that goal.
Invasive Procedures - This is a great episode in that it does give us some idea about how Trills end up being joined Trills.
Cardassians - This outstanding episode serves well to give us a slight glimpse into Garak and at the same time raises more questions about this superb character played by Andrew Robinson.
Rules of Acquisition - This is another outstanding Ferengi episode starring Quark, one of the most entertaining characters of the series.  Along with Quark, we're treated to Grand Nagus Zek and several other Ferengi characters.
Necessary Evil - This is one of the most outstanding episodes of the season as it gives us a glimpse into what DS9 was like when it was Terok Nor and under Cardassian rule during their occupation of Bajor.  Rene Auberjonois performs admirably as Odo when Gul Dukat thrusts him into the role of an investigator in order to discover who killed a Bajoran merchant.  This is when Odo and Kira met and also where a huge question between them wasn't answered until the poignant conclusion of this episode.
Blood Oath - In this incredible episode we're treated to three Original Series Klingons all dressed up as ""new"" Klingons and they have a blood oath in which Jadzia Dax is a part of.  This great episode is certainly a great precursor to her later ""Klingon"" episodes and when Worf joins the crew.
The Maquis, Part I & II - As a follow on to STNG's episode, ""Journey's End"" establishing the treaty between the Federation and Cardassia where several colonies end up on the wrong side of the border and the setup of the premise to the beginning of Star Trek Voyager, we're treated to a full blown Maquis episode.  What makes this so intriguing is the fact that Sisko and gang don't necessarily know who to trust due to several Starfleet officers resigning to join the Maquis.
The Wire - Even after seeing a full seven years of DS9, this episode stands out as one of the best featuring the Garak character.  Again, we're treated to a few answers about this rather enigmatic character, such as his first name Elim but we're also left to question whether what was revealed was true or not...
Crossover - After so many years of waiting, we're finally treated to what happened to the Mirror Universe after Kirk left.  Kira and Bashir run into some form of an anomaly and then go through the wormhole only to find they've gone through the looking glass.  This is but the first of several outstanding, humorous and enlightening ""Crossover"" episodes.
Tribunal - In this outstanding and quite poignant episode, we see O'Brien captured and put on trial by the Cardassians.  Colm Meaney performs brilliantly in this episode where his character is tried, convicted and sentenced all prior to his capture.
The Jem'Hadar - In this great season finale, we finally get to find out a little bit of what the rumored Dominion is about along with their fighting force, the Jem'Hadar.  This episode is extremely intriguing as we see a Galaxy class starship easily defeated and we see that Starfleet's defenses are easily defeated by the Jem'Hadar.  This episode is one of the biggest reasons why DS9 is referred to as a 176 hour saga because from here on out a majority of the episodes deal directly or indirectly with the pending war between the Federation and the Dominion and the whole ""epic"" feel of it all.  {ssintrepid}

794197,5,630413231X,"The second season of DS9 ranks not only as one of the best in the seven year history of this series, but also as one of the best in the entire Star Trek legacy.
Things get off to a great start with the opening trilogy (The Homecoming/The Circle/The Siege), and the rest of the season easily lives up to expectations. The Maquis (two-parter), more Nagus (Rules of Acquisition), three legendary Klingons (Blood Oath), Garak (The Wire), the stirring (Cardassians), a mirror universe (Crossover), the underrated (Necessary Evil), and of course the big-ticket season finale (The Jem'Hadar) are just a few of the standout episodes you'll find contained in this DVD set.
I find the political and spiritual themes of DS9 to be extraordinarily entertaining. The brilliant writers and actors really hit their stride here in season two. I've been on vacation this past week, and have been watching episodes almost non-stop, I enjoy it that much.
Top-notch production values enhance this DVD set, making it even a greater value.
Highly recommended....I can't wait for season three.",1050451200,11,1069,5.079545454545454
794198,5,630413231X,"Deep Space Nine was the most thoughtful of all the Star Trek series, and I am delighted to have the first two seasons in my home on DVD! (I plan to buy all of the seasons as time goes by.)
Of all the Star Trek series, DS9 did the best job of presenting ""story arcs"" that allowed them to seriously develop characters and philosophical themes. It is therefore a great pleasure to see the episodes without commercials and in the order they were intended to be seen in. (The last time this series aired on our local L.A. airways at 4 AM, the station scrambled the order of the episodes, perhaps not realizing that each episode builds on the previous one.)
Watching these episodes is like inviting old friends into your home! The DVDs come with lots of special interviews and special goodies, too. This is well worth the money.",1050364800,,822,4.486666666666666
794199,4,630413231X,"Although DS9 was still finding its legs, season two demonstrated that DS9 wasn't going to be a Trek knock off. The writing by co-creator Michael Pillar, Ira Behr and others developed a number of key conflicts that would continue to pay off until the series conclusion 5 years later. Conflict is the essence of drama and Ds9 makes the most of the conflict between the spiritual Bajorans, the secular Federation, the xenophobic Founders and the untrustworthy Cardassians.
Oscar Winner Louise Fletcher returns to the role of an evil Vedick and she makes the most of this role. During the second season her character develops more depth. Guest stars such as Frank Langella, Steve Weber, Stephen Macht and others bring considerable acting muscle to the series. Let's not overlook any of the regulars. DS9 had an acting ensemble comparable to TNG in depth and experience.
Politics plays a much larger role in DS9 than TNG. Part of that is the confined nature of a series set on a space station. But DS9 really was always meant to be Casablanca in space to some degree. The complex story arcs began their development here during the second season.
The boxed set (unlike the first season) contains 26 episodes and about an hour and a half of extras that are enlightening but hardly essential. Once again Paramount missed the boat with the DVD reissue of this series. Commentaries from actors, writers and directors would have been interesting and provided an extra dimension to the DVD. Additionally, Paramount has priced DS9 like Trek at a premium....",1049500800,27,1544,4.919540229885057
794260,5,630413231X,DS9 is the best Trek series ever bar none.  What makes it personally and thematically better is that it deal with interpersonal conflicts as well as eventually war.  The other shows touched on them but then raced away before truly exposing the ramifications of all the actions performed.,1049328000,2,287,4.958333333333333
794261,5,630413231X,"The viewer from California didn't like the series because it dare to be diffrent from established trek formula, where starship travels throughout the galaxy, encountering new races in every episodes.
For me it is a plus, not an disadventage. Because after four series placed on starship, it was welcome change for me. And it was also a plus for me that this series was more drama oriented than the others (but of course there was much action, especially from season 3 onward)
But back on topic. Season 2 was a big improvement from season 1.
I still don't rank it higher than seasons 4-7, but season 2 was already very good. It had many great episodes. I name some of them.
It begins with the first trek 3 parter in history. And very good one I might add, which mix action with political intrigue.
The Cardassians is another very good episode which examine a distrust between Bajoran and Cardassian. Next great episode is Necessary Evil (this rank among the best Trek episodes ever) which shows us DS9 (Terok Nor) during the occupation.
Other great episodes in this season includes Whispers , which offers us an intresting mystery and Blood Oath in which we meet 3 klingons from original series (Kor, Kang and Koloth). The season end on particulary high note with few very good episodes in a row, like The Maquis, which as title suggest introduce us to the Maquis (they appear for the first time on DS9, not on TNG, as someone suggested). Next was fascinating The Wire, in which we get glimpses of Garak past, or we didn't , we can never be sure. Crossover the next very good episode, is where we visit mirror universe, for the first time in 30 years. Season 2 ends on particulary high note, with action packed The Jem'hadar, where we for the first time meet Dominion, or at least a military arm of it.
There are some others good eps which I didn't mention.
Of course there are some weaker episodes, but IMO none of them is downright poor (mostly just avarage) like Melora, Sanctuary or Rivals and few others but not many.
So, this is very good season, well worth watching. So watch it, you won't be dissapointed. And bring already seasons 4-7 which are in my opinon the best trek ever.",1047772800,7,2185,4.576530612244898

794264,5,630413231X,"The second season opens with a 3 part story (a first for Trek) which picks up the ideas that ended season one's ""In the Hands of the Prophets.""  Watch for Steven Weber (NBC's tv series ""Wings"", ABC's mini-series ""The Shining"", ""Jeffrey"") as a Bajoran rebel.  Not his best acting ever, but he gets some great moments of action, and he is so darn handsome!
Many of this season's episodes are launching points into the epic story that runs the length of DS9's seven years: the conflict between the Federation, the Dominion, Bajor, the Klingons, the Cardassians, etc. Plenty of scene-stealing performances by Louise Fletcher as Vedek Winn (no spoilers here!) and Jeffrey Combs as Gul Dukat. They become two of the best 'villians' in Trek history, doing both good and not-so-good things that affect our heroes lives and goals.
In ""Crossover"" get our first trip back to the mirror universe that was the setting of classic Trek's ""Mirror Mirror.""  It's such fun to see our characters take on different personalities.
The last 7 episodes of the season are especially top-notch drama, not to be missed!  ""The Maquis"" parts 1 & 2 contain some of the best space battle effects I have ever seen, and as another reviewer mentioned ""The Wire"" is a classic, where we learn (maybe) much about Garak's past, as well as see how well Trek can handle current day issues in a futuristic setting.
Buy this!",1045180800,8,1384,4.7782426778242675
794265,3,630413231X,"This season included some great episodes. It starts out with a riveting three-part story about Bajoran society and politics (Homecoming, Circle, Siege) which further develops the Bajoran characters on the show. Invasive Procedures delivers suspense, Armageddon Game is an intriguing look at biological weapons with a subtle built-in irony. Profit and Loss has Quark moving profit down on the priority list (for once) and shows another aspect of Quark.
The best of the set, however, has to be Whispers. An artfully constructed conspiracy story is often underrated and forgotten when fans make top-10 lists, Whispers was the most atypical trek episode that had been produced up to this point. Told in flashback with voice-over narration, Chief O'Brien recalls the steps which caused him to suspect a massive conspiracy. The true power of the episode, though, is in the journey and in a truly inspired twist at the end. The use of subjective point of view filtered through O'Brien keeps the viewer unprepared for what awaits. The set should be purchased because of this very episode.
There are also many episodes that begin long-lasting storylines. The Wire is a mind-bending episode dealing with Garak's sordid past. It also set up one of the best story arcs on the show that would blossom in the following season. The arrival of the Maquis was an infinitely important Trek development, for it not only began a storyline which lasted for several seasons, but also contributed storylines to TNG and made Voyager possible. Crossover brought back the mirror universe from the original series and began a storyline that would continue well into the sixth season. The most important, though, has to be contact with the Jem'Hadar, signalling a metamorphosis in the series and beginning the journey to the show's destiny.
Sadly, the season is dragged down by inferior episodes, some of which are generally considered to be the show's worst. Melora is a clunker of a preachy message episode about the handicapped. Similarly, Rivals is a boring episode with the most preposterous science that I have ever heard in an episode of any Trek show. There are a number of filler shows which keep this season from reaching its full potential. Nevertheless, it contains some enjoyment, and is worth the purchase. This season paved the way for the rest of the series.",1044489600,17,2346,5.064599483204135
794266,5,630413231X,"This was the season that won me over to Star Trek: Deep Space Nine! I became a ""Niner"" (subset of Star Trek fans) after I watched the repeat airing of the season finale ""The Jem'Hadar"". I had never seen anything like it on TV before. ""The Jem'Hadar"" featured an intriguing ""who are they?"" story about the fearsome Jem'Hadar - the soldier race of the Dominion, coupled with the grandest space battle (at that time) that I had ever seen on TV. Sure, the space battles would improve in later seasons, as would the characters and writing, but it showed me enough to keep me on board.
Later on I would see the remarkable three-part season opener - commonly referred to as ""The Circle Trilogy"" - along with other gems like ""Blood Oath"" (which brought back three of the original Star Trek's best Klingons: Kor, Kang and Koloth), ""The Maquis, Parts I & II"" (for better or worse, this is where Voyager began), ""The Wire"" (one of the best Garak stories) and ""Crossover"" (DS9's first visit to the classic Mirror Universe).
This was the year that Ira Steven Behr, Peter Allan Fields, Robert Hewitt Wolfe and James Crocker started to fully realize what the Dominion was and what it would later become. This quadrant-spanning empire was first mentioned during the first season, but this is where the ongoing story arc truly started. If you like SF that is daring, vivid and thoroughly complex, DS9 is the series for you.

The 3-part season-opening story arc (The Homecoming, The Circle, and The Siege) shows us the darker side of Bajoran politics.
Invasive Procedures gives us a deeper glimpse into Jadzia Dax.
Shadowplay teaches us about loss and the lengths someone will go to keep memory of loved ones intact, while at the same time giving us a cryptic preview of the Dominion.
Blood Oath gives us a glimpse of the past with Klingons being portrayed by legendary original Trek actors, such as Michael Ansara.
The Maquis two-parter kicks off the storyline regarding ex-Federation members having to go it alone against the Cardassians in the De-Militarized Zone.
Crossover shows us the consequences of James T. Kirk's actions from the original Trek episode ""Mirror, Mirror.""
The Jem'Hadar finally introduces us to the sinister Dominion, in what will turn out to be the dominating storyline for the rest of the series.

794268,5,630413231X,"The powers that be pulled out all the stops for this excellent and very good-looking first show of the Deep Space Nine series.  The infamous and often referred to battle at Wolf 359 is finally seen to some extended length in the beginning of 'Emissary'; the rundown space station is a well-conceived set design; the matte painting of the Bajoran temple on the planet surface is mesmerizing albeit too briefly seen; and all those aliens!  The production design put forth here was the most superior effort by the creative staff in any Trek program to date - heck some of the movies don't look this great!
Also the story is a terrific, hard edged and dyed-in-the-wool science fiction tale that is handled well.  The revelation of the existence of the wormhole; the incorporeal wormhole beings using a variety of people from Sisko's memories to interact with him; the explanation of the mysterious Orbs and their purpose; Sisko using the game of baseball to demonstrate the concept of linear time; his rush of emotions over his admittance of his inability to 'exist beyond the moment his wife died' and that he has been living in non-linear time; many more brilliant touches are present within this well-structured script.
The characters are surprisingly well defined for a first episode.  Normally the main characters undergo a severe change in the shows immediately following; an actor will begin to add their personality to the composite of the person they are playing and these differences are usually noticeable.  That doesn't happen on ST: DS9 though, the character flow from pilot to series inception is practically seamless.  The best character interchange we get to see in 'Emissary' is the scene in Sisko's new office where he has called together Odo and Quark for a meeting.  The tension between Odo and Quark comes into play right away; Quark breaks out in uproarious laughter at Sisko's request for him to remain at DS9 and become a community leader; Odo sarcastically makes the observation that Quark has all the natural qualities of a politician.  The addition of the character of Dax allows the show to continue the familiar Trek theme of the differences between our Earth-centric view of everything in terms of humanity and the point of view from an outsider that adds interesting and conflicting complexities.  Being over three hundred years old and having existed as a variety of alien beings added a great and very unique dimension to this Trek series.  As far as the actors go for this particular show an honorable mention should be made for the young Cirroc Lofton; he stood in for the wormhole aliens in a variety of sequences and did an admirable job.  Also his scenes with Avery Brooks as father and son are believable and convincing.
Best line: Sisko and Gul Dukat's first meeting is quite memorable.  When Gul Dukat makes a point of how uncomfortably close the Federation members are to the formidable Cardassians Sisko remarks sarcastically ""We'll be sure and keep the dog off the lawn.""",1044057600,4,3011,4.9171597633136095
794269,5,630413231X,"Dear Amazon.com Customers,
What could be more exciting than having Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Season One on DVD? Well how about Season Two on DVD? This release is the next series of installments of the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine programs. The first season focused mainly on the environment settles and the foundation elements for the various characters. The second season of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine picks up substantially in themes and plots with greater emphasis on each of the major races and characters and their respective roles in this quadrant of space.
In this release, the commander of the space station Benjamin Sisko played by ""Avery Brooks"" comes to terms with his role as the Emissary for the Bajoran people. Although he still misses his role as the commander of a starship, he becomes more settled as the commander of what later becomes the most important space station in the Federation. The character Major Kira played by ""Nana Visitor"" has accepted the fact that the Bajoran people cannot seek revenge against their enemies the Cardassians without causing more suffering and hardship to their own planet of Bajor. Although Major Kira still has angry feelings toward the Federation for not aiding Bajor in a retaliatory war against the Cardassians, she manages to stage her own personal campaign against the Cardassians throughout this series.
During the second season of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, the audience finally gets to see the inter-workings and politics of the sometimes-complicated race called the Ferengi. The character called Quark played by ""Armin Shimerman"" shows that even though he governs his life by the strict code of conduct, The Ferengi Rules of Acquisition, he has his moments in which passion and family come first before business. Even the character called Odo played by ""Rene Auberjonois"" is surprised at Quark's behavior in his emotional moments. It is in this series that the audience also learns the originals of Odo and that his search for knowing who he really is will lead to the most significant event in this entire section of the galaxy and the series of the show.
The audience also gets to see the return of the most popular race in all of the Star Trek universe series of stories, the Klingons. Although their presents is very short during this season of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, their role as citizens of the galaxy will determine the fate for all races and species in this section of space. Sci-Fi fans in this season of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine will also get to view more insight into the most unusual race of the Federation which are called the Trill. The character Jadzia Dax played by ""Terry Farrell"" finds herself caught between past lives and present ones. This aspect of the series becomes an interesting challenge for the writers of the show Star Trek: Deep Space Nine because the character Jadzia Dax has actually lived many lives. This aspect of the Trill having symbionts to share their life with the Trill host introduces a very high level of complexities to the character development of Jadzia Dax.
I could go on and on but the best thing for you to do is purchase Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Season Two on DVD and see it for yourself. I think that you will find the themes and stories just as intriguing and interesting as most of the Sci-Fi and Trekker fans have come to discovery.

But for the most part you can't help but feel that the series was more about representing unused Next Generation story ideas, when more and more of the stories takes place off the station and at some new planet in the Gamma quadrant. I found myself a few times thinking that the episode could easily be translated to Picard and crew with little if nothing to do with a space station at the furthest reaches of space.
