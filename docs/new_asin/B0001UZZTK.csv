2026136,5,B0001UZZTK,"This movie was a wonderful surprise.  I bought it because it stars Paul Gross, whose work I've appreciated in the Due South television series.  I expected to see an ordinary boy-meets-girl romance, something cute, fluffy, and forgettable with some nice eye candy.

Instead, I found a well-written, beautifully filmed, and very well-acted story that works on a number of levels.  Yes, there's a love story at its heart, though hardly of the traditional sort.  More than that, it's an exploration of the realities and economic necessities of life in a small, remote agricultural community - it takes place in the foothills of Alberta, Canada, but could just as well have taken place in any small farm town in North America - and of the intersection of cultures: Ukrainian and Scottish immigrants, Natives (""Indians""), and city folks learning to make a go of small-town farming life.  Most of all, it's about the interconnected lives of a handful of people and how they and their relationships grow and change as a result of the unorthodox romance between the two central characters.

The cast is uniformly excellent; there are no weak performances.  The beautiful, spare Alberta landscape is an important character in its own right.  The score could perhaps be a bit better, but is at least unobtrusive and is enhanced by three k.d. lang songs.  The only slight fault I found was with the ending, which I felt was perhaps just a bit more abrupt than it might have been, but that's a very small criticism within the greater scope of a movie that I loved and will doubtless watch again and again.

Very much recommended.",1116806400,7,1616,4.861313868613139
2026137,5,B0001UZZTK,"One of my all time favorite love stories - tenderness, gentleness and emotional.

Mama wants her daughter to become a concert pianist [she actually plays in lounges] not settle for the ranch that will drag her down.

She has other ideas, as her father has left the ranch to her, but her mother wants to sell.

She has the land but not much working knowledge when Alex applies as a handyman.

It becomes a very sticky point when she finds out that Alex has a son with a woman he didn't marry.

I loved the line ""When he's gone, he's gone"" ---- how Alex makes it up to his son and finally wins Sophie.

The whole gist of mama trying to undermine Sophie's determination to keep the ranch and her interest in Alex was heart-rending.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED -- definitely a keeper to watch over and over again.",1100736000,20,801,4.408163265306122
2026138,5,B0001UZZTK,"Formerly titled ""Buffalo Jump"", this Canadian romance stars Paul Gross (of Due South fame) and Wendy Crewson (Santa Clause movies.)  Wendy plays a woman rancher in need of a hire hand.  Paul Gross will help on one condition - that they have a platonic business marriage and share the profits from the ranch.  Families from both sides interfere and weigh in on the the issue, and the tension and tenderness between the two leads is believable and heartbreaking.  The scenery is breathtaking, as is the soundtrack featuring many of K.D. Langs first hits.  Whether you rent it or buy it, this is a romance to treasure.",1090022400,36,615,4.764150943396227

2026218,5,B0001UZZTK,"This movie is a delight from beginning to end.  It is well acted, the scenery is stunning, the background music is pleasing and the story line is authentic (a Ukrainian friend who grew up in eastern Alberta attests to this).  Even better, there is a real ""chemistry"" shared by the primary actors, not only in the love story between Wendy Crewson and Paul Gross, but also those who play family and friends.  I suspect that Getting Married In Buffalo Jump is a sleeper in the U.S., so suggest that you give it a try.

The premise was unusual, a marriage based on a business decision, but the characters were lovable and the acting was very good.  I learned that Canada has some beautiful country and that the ""old west cowboy lifestyle"" I previously thought was only found in America extends up into the Canadian province as well.  I would recommend this film for those whose heart is longing for the country even though your feet may be planted in the city.  I like to escape in this way through films and this one did it for me.",1439510400,,646,4.394957983193278

2026269,5,B0001UZZTK,"I've lived closer to Mexico than to Canada (West Texas), and I was not aware of the similarities and differences between the US and Canada.  I've watched more films with Paul Gross since this one, and the narrow field of actors in Canada is much like that in the UK, surrounded by all that water -- We have watched British TV, and found an astonishing re-use of actors/actresses from show to show.  I feel that I know some of these people!!",1439078400,3,440,4.419753086419753
2026270,2,B0001UZZTK,"...And this is why Canadian films rarely win Academy Awards (with all due respect to Canadians.)  Yikes. This wasn't a terrible movie, but certainly not a ""5-star romance"" like some reviewers claim.  It was more like a advertisement for Canadian tourism. The scenery was beautiful and there are some breathtaking cinemagraphic shots, but that alone can't compensate for the other failures of this film. The actors were wooden and lacking depth--a shame considering that the main characters are complicated people with a past. The rest of the characters fall into cheesy stereotypes.
 I agree with another reviewer who points out that this story seems incomplete.  There are so many holes and unanswered questions here that all the scenes just seem fragmented and poorly paced.  The nudity that seems to bother so many negative reviewers is quite tame by contemporary standards (not frontal).  Even the love scene is relatively bland. The nudity is relegated to a skinny dipping scene which honestly seems odd and misplaced in the script. Gratuitous? Maybe. It can't be classified as ""steamy"" but it's probably not a family film unless you want to cover your kid's eyes during that scene.

Basically, this is just a sexed-up Janette Oke plot with a soundtrack that is part ""Urban Cowboy"" and part ""Love Boat.""  Bad music with absolutely no continuity.  I finished watching the movie because hey, I'd already started it and truly, I will watch anything with moving pictures. But no way would I watch it again or recommend it for viewing.",1438819200,,1535,5.0355731225296445

2026359,5,B0001UZZTK,"Complete surprise.  I expected a cute but forgettable romance.  Treated instead to an extremely well-acted, low key and original story with many themes.  The romance, while present is woven seamlessly and in a natural way into the larger story that permits a slow and thoughtful character development.  It does not benefit from but nor does it need slick Hollywood gimmickry such as swelling soundtracks to shore up otherwise sketchy characters and well worn story lines.  Leaves one thinking.

2026483,4,B0001UZZTK,"I'd recommend this movie for anyone who yearns for magnificent wide-open spaces [Alberta, Canada], gorgeous folks, good saddle horses and a Hallmark [Romance/Drama] movie style plot. Granted, it's past its prime now, but there's a certain timeless quality to the romantic conflict that's always enjoyable. I'm still clueless about where Buffalo Jump is, however, missed its mentioning even once.

The eighties-style score -- except for kd lang's great songs -- is outdated, but having said that, hey, it was the [late] eighties!

Don't look for many scenery chewing moments. Paul Gross's strong-but-subtle rendering of ""Alex"" contrasts with every other character I've ever seen him play in his films, but that's partly due to the character's personality of the old-school silent type. I'd hire him to just stand there and exist, at any time in his career.

Wendy Crewson's ""Sophie"" is excellent as well, If you're a Due South TV series fan, you saw her great comic performance as the Bounty Hunter in season three.

Also notable is the supporting cast, especially Marion Gilsenan's standout role as Sophie's mom. She's everybody's Scottish mum. And I know whereof I speak.",1401580800,,1172,5.218085106382978
2026484,3,B0001UZZTK,"Sophie inherits an Alberta prairie ranch, and over the objections of her demanding, childish, wounded, self-absorbed mother, she determines to make a go of it.  Sophie is a university graduate and talented pianist, and her mother believes she should have a more sophisticated, exciting future than what awaits her as a lifetime rancher.

Ranching is hard work and, as with any task, collaboration makes it much less daunting, so Sophie hires Alex, an ambitious, hard-working, local ranch hand, to help with daily operations.  He is at once unassuming and presumptuous, if such a combination is at all possible.

Both Sophie and Alex are young, attractive and likeable characters, and it seems perfectly natural that they would be drawn to each other, but the surprise is how their relationship finds its start; Alex proposes marriage so Sophie can keep her ranch  and so can HE!

The story is a sweet one, actually.  It follows the leading characters as they learn more about themselves and each other, and learn to love and respect the qualities that will help them build a solid partnership. Ultimately, we know they really do love each other, but it takes a long time for both of them to overcome her persistent doubts.  From the start, Alex has no doubts at all.

I didn't give this film the highest rating for a variety of reasons.  Mostly, I thought screenwriters dropped the ball, and the narrative was incomplete.  It contained marvelous, short clips of breathtaking landscapes that must have been directed by the Alberta Tourist Board, but the time should have been devoted to supporting characters' development and exploration.  I noticed that many action scenes, too, were just short clips, generally unconnected to the scenes that preceded or followed.  I also lamented the fact that theres no sense of time in the telling of the story  how long did it take for them to go from Sophies fathers funeral to her wedding?  Was it months, seasons, or years?

Why did Sophies mother, Vera, leave Scotland and settle on a ranch in the middle of nowhere?  We know she came from wealth, so how did she end up on the prairie?  Though she never actually said it in the film, she obviously hated and resented all the years she was consigned to such a simple, humble, challenging life.

And then theres Sophies best friend, Eleanor.  Have they known each other all their lives, or did they grow their friendship in college, or in Big City life after graduation?  We know very little about Eleanor, only that she is a real estate agent, a loyal friend, and shes very brash  to the point of being downright coarse; she shows up to collude with Vera in schemes to push Sophie into selling the ranch  and leave Alex behind, of course.

Wendy Crewson and Paul Gross were well-cast as Sophie and Alex, I think, but some of the ancillary characters simply didn't enjoy the same kind of honest portrayal.  If I want to know more about the characters and events, I suppose Ill have to find the book.",1399852800,,2989,4.757281553398058

More important, the film and its source book present a nuanced, complicated view of what makes the northern plains so culturally fascinating -- a heath & stirring mix of Sottish ""birthright"" hertage, Native peoples' rights, and Eastern European latecomers' desires, bound together in a compelling and difficult land in which to make one's living -- and, as a result (especially for those of us in the US) so wonderfully and quintessentially Canadian in inclusiveness and feel. Some could call this a ""chick flick"" (fine with me) but it is a much larger, more important story riding on a romance.  Apparently originally a CBC-made for broadcast film that never was recognized for its larger possibilites.  Glad to see it's avalable now on DVD.",1290816000,,1052,5.0

2026498,4,B0001UZZTK,"On an isolated ranch on the Alberta prairie where the foothills of the Rockies make for spectacular scenery,  an attractive ranch hand awkwardly proposes a quid pro quo to his boss. He mends fences and squires her to town and cattle auctions. She defends her decision to stay on the ranch she inherited to an ambitious and somewhat bitter widowed mother who would rather see her daughter return to Toronto even if it is only to a career as a lounge singer. The daughter falls for the ranch hand, most would . But the ranch hand has a past and a family only to eager to advocate a lop sided marriage settlement for their son. It's hard to tell what the proposed bridegroom feels.  What should the heroine do ?

Adding texture to the main plot are tidbits of cultural anthropology, Alberta style.
The ambitions of discriminated against Ukrainian farm families, the errors of small town gossip, the disadvantages which accrue to First Nation people in western Canada and the primogeniture strictures of landed families are all explored. Pace unfolds like the kd lang soundtrack , erotic, mellow  and husky.

I have watched this film countless times. It makes a case for trusting the good in others and for the value of  sticking to basics. It argues for integrity, it debunks cuteness, and it makes a case for following one's heart.

Although this buffalo jump is metaphoric there are many real ones on the western plains from Wyoming north. And there is a quintessential Buffalo Jump in southern Alberta which evokes the landscape of this film.

Should you make the pilgrimage to see the locations of this film it is also worth noting the nearby scenery shot for the film Brokeback Mountain. All can be seen north of the Montana border up towards Calagary and then Jasper NP.

It was Canadian as is all of Gross's work.  Thus, this love story is also Canadian, set on a ranch in Alberta. The story is marriage of convenience in plot but that is about all that is borrowed in this fresh and captivating story. The woman inherits her father's ranch and Gross will help her run it (since she doesn't know how) if they get married.  She is fresh from the city, an urbanite.  He has always lived in this Alberta wide open spaces milieu. There is nothing schmaltzy or gimmicky about this film.  It is very realistic and the romance builds believably. Paul Gross is a big discovery for an American audience.  I am still tracking down his other work.

The mountains in the background were breathtaking.  It's not a guy kind of movie, but for the true romantic it's a must have for your video library.  Parts were played well and the characters believable.

There were a couple of real hard to believe scenes.  It's hard to believe that the nude romps in the creek never amounted to more than a brief kiss and the continuation of a ""business"" arrangement.  The male star hunk chomped on his toothpick 24/7 except for that occasional kiss.  It was a sexy touch once, but it could have been dropped from the rest of the movie AND as any well bred cowgirl (or cowboy) knows it isn't a very bright cowboy who breaks from a chute to bulldog a steer with that toothpick in his mouth!!  Loved the movie, but the toothpick thing I found very distracting.",1145232000,2,950,4.4393063583815024
2026506,5,B0001UZZTK,"This movie was a wonderful surprise. I bought it because it stars Paul Gross, whose work I've appreciated in the Due South television series. I expected to see an ordinary boy-meets-girl romance, something cute, fluffy, and forgettable with some nice eye candy.
Instead, I found a well-written, appealingly filmed, and very well-acted story that works on a number of levels. Yes, there's a love story at its heart, though hardly of the traditional sort. More than that, it's an exploration of the realities and economic necessities of life in a small, remote agricultural community - it takes place in the foothills of Alberta, Canada, but could just as well have taken place in any small farm town in North America - and of the intersection of cultures: Ukrainian and Scottish immigrants, Natives (""Indians""), and city folks learning to make a go of small-town farming life. Most of all, it's about the interconnected lives of a handful of people and how they and their relationships grow and change as a result of the unorthodox romance between the two central characters.
The cast is uniformly excellent; there are no weak performances. The beautiful, spare Alberta landscape is an important character in its own right. The score could perhaps be a bit better, but is at least unobtrusive and is enhanced by three k.d. lang songs. The only slight fault I found was with the ending, which I felt was perhaps just a bit more abrupt than it might have been, but that's a very small criticism within the greater scope of a movie that I loved and will doubtless watch again and again.

I've seen movies set in the great windswept regions of the American West. We Americans forget that Canada has all of this - in spades. I've seen movies where life takes place in little towns where a lot of the gossip is exchanged over beers at the popular bar and diner. We Americans forget that Canada has all of this - in spaces.

The plot follows a trajectory, with predictable subplots. But this is Canada. They are the nice guys, right? So when you see someone from a character's past turn up, an American film would have a challenging sexy twist to the story. Let's just say: this is more Hallmark in the way those things are handled - or not - as the case may be. I was most impressed by the interaction of the generations in this movie. So refreshing, so different from what even Hallmark would offer up.
