8302822,4,B001FWVKU6,"I want to thank Cinema Epoch for releasing this film in a nice widescreen-letterboxed transfer. It's a whole different experience than Something Weird Video's full screen, 4:3 picture. I was very surprised. This looks more like an arthouse film with a stunning black and white photography, excellent direction and music. It is very similar to the japanese pink films of the 60's and 70's. Lee Frost is probably the best director-cinematographer of this period. With a better script-plot, this would be a masterpiece. A must for fans of sixties exploitation films.",1360972800,,563,5.197802197802198
8302823,4,B001FWVKU6,"If you grew up in that era as I did, you probably have voyeuristic tendencies, especially if you grew up in an urban area where an assortment of ladies, both young and middle-aged (pre-MILF era), were engaged in  fashionable competetion with one another for the delight and attention of local boys and men. This flick is like peering through the blinds of a neighbor's window and getting lucky enough to catch a young woman getting undressed. And another. And another. Ocassionally, we're treated to being inside the apartment of nubile nymphs engaged in sapphic seductions, or at a 60's party where, once the booze flowed profusely enough, some comely babe got bold enough to jump up on a cocktail table and strip for the partiers, to the encougagement and delight of both men and ladies alike. The nudity flows like water from a spiget, and if you're ok with it being in B+W, it's amusing. That's pretty much it, except that the moody, self-absorbed protagonist overdoses at the end of the flick, as we all sigh in relief knowing society's better off without him. Yes, 'Love Is A Four Letter Word' is back after all these years, for better or worse, for peeping toms to 'leer' at, another four letter word.",1276387200,2,1208,4.725118483412322
8302824,4,B001FWVKU6,"The title has for some reason been changed, because this is the infamous ""Love Is a Four-Letter Word"" from Lee Frost and Bob Cresse. I had looked in vain for this film ever since I saw color stills from it in Playboy magazine circa 1968. (Playboy had a ""sex in cinema"" section back when, believe it or not, even a little nudity on the screen was a big deal.) Years ago, an expert in the grindhouse field informed me that LIAFLW had undoubtedly been lost forever, but a print has at last turned up. It has obviously been restored, too, since a film that spent 43 years in some cardboard box couldn't possibly look as good as this one does.

The film itself shows the real title as well as the correct production date of 1966 (not 1964 as is commonly found). For people who didn't experience that decade, there was an enormous difference between the early and the late 1960s in terms of what could be shown in a theater. This picture could not have been made in 1964: what you're seeing here is how far Frost and Cresse dared stretch the limits in 1966. Compare this movie, though, to what they were making two years later, such as ""Love Camp 7,"" and it's obvious that the rules were changing fast in what have accurately been called the ""sick, sick sixties."" Oddly, though LIAFLW depicts nothing close to explicit sex, it could not be made in 2009, either. It is among the first wave of a particular genre of underground sleaze that existed from the mid-1960s through the ""Ginger"" movies of the early 1970s.

Viewers who didn't experience that era will watch this picture and think, ""So what?"" But it's a classic to those who remember another age. It was worth the long wait, so thanks to whatever grindhouse archeologist scrounged through that abandoned old theater on the seamy side of town and dug it out!",1242950400,8,1807,4.522935779816514
8302825,3,B001FWVKU6,"Not what I expected. More like Holden Caulfield goes to Cali looking for sex in the 1960's.
It was okay, but unless I fell asleep the product description lied.
There was no ""orgiastic satanic voodoo ritual snake worship etc...""
Just some guy exploring himself, watching sex acts, and naked chicks.",1238889600,,297,4.96
