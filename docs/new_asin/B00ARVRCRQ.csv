8557036,2,B00ARVRCRQ,"I DVR'd this and watched it last night. I had not seen it before.

I am not sure what the point of the movie was.

It is supposed to be a Korean War POW film, and nominally it is, but it is so far off the mark as far as anything that really happened in any North Korean POW camp that it might as well be Hogan's Heros.

Brian Keith plays a secondary role.

The main character is a US sgt who becomes a collaborator. Eventually he gets the wife of a Russian commissar played by an actor (E.G. Marshall) who did not even remotely look or sound Russian.

Apparently, he and the character played by Brian Keith are US agents sent into the prison camp to spy on NK atrocities and report back in some kind of bizarre attempt to influence the peace negotiations.

The movie and its premise seemed so absurd that in places I laughed at it, but mostly I just shook my head.

I am not even sure why I watched the whole thing, but I did so in my personal rating system that gets it a minimum of two stars.",1379116800,6,994,4.066666666666666
