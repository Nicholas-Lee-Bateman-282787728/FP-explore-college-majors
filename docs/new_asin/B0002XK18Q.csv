2135843,5,B0002XK18Q,"These two movies are the newer versions of the spiderman movies and are excellent. The storyline is good and the special effects will just blow you away. I will explain a little about the two movies.

Spider-man:

This is the first movie where you can see how peter parker turned into this ""human spider"". The story is well-thought-out with a great plot. This movie is loaded with action and will keep you entertained throughout the whole movie without one boring minute. The ending is great and Peter will definitely be shocked when he finds out who the villian is. But will he defeat his villian? This movie leads you into the next movie. Definitely a classic!

Spider-man 2:

As for this movie it's just as good as the first, if not better. This one has more action and really pulls you in fast, even if you haven't seen the first movie. It also has some funny (actually silly) jokes that will make you laugh. But it can be frightening at times, especially for kids. The ending is very, very good and reveals a huge secret to.....well, can't tell you which characters, you'll have to watch it first.

Now, the only reason I didn't write much about what happens throughout the movie, is because I didn't want to spoil anything. These movies are full of surprises that can't be spoiled and will make you wanna watch them again and again.

Overall, Spider-man and Spider-man 2 are pure classics and everybody must own these superhero movies. Trust me, you won't regret it.

Highly recommended!",1147564800,4,1493,4.675572519083969
2135844,5,B0002XK18Q,"$hit... if you are gonna get one or the other, go with this double pack. Need I say more?",1146787200,,89,3.736842105263158
2135845,5,B0002XK18Q,"I really enjoyed the special edition versions of both Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2. Both movies are great adaptations of the comic. The villians are great and Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina both give inspired performances. Tobey Maguire was a great choice for Spider-Man and he plays a convincing Peter Parker as well. I can't wait for Spider-Man 3, especially because Sam Raimi is again going to be the director. He has really grown as a filmaker. And I hope Bruce Campbell makes a cameo in Part 3, too.",1142467200,,503,4.7272727272727275
2135846,5,B0002XK18Q,"I loved the first movie!  And the second one was even better (in my opinion)!  I owned the first movie in VHS and wanted it on DVD so I when the second one came out I got this double set.  And I am pleased with it!

Spiderman fights with The Green Goblin in the first movie.  Spiderman has to also deal with moral issues and the Green Goblin is related to one of Spiderman's close friends.  Also you start the story of Peter and Mary Jane.  In one you also see that Peter's Uncle dies.  All of this gives a great plot and keeps your interest!  There is more in the movie but that is your main plot themes.  Spiderman is very heavy in morals and life lessons.  It is also great as a story!

Spiderman 2 was even better than the first in my opinion.  Why?  I think that the characters had grown and the acting was better I also liked the fact that Mary Jane finds out Peter's secret!  Doc Ock was also a strong role.  It was great at portraying demons and the hardships of life and loss.  There is so much in Spiderman 2.  Peter has to tell his Aunt May a secret that will tear him and his Aunt apart.  He also struggles with being Spiderman and even toys with the thought of giving it up (let you watch to figure out if he does).  Mary Jane gets engaged and struggles with her friendship/love for Peter.  And James Franco discovers secrets in his own life and in Peter's life.  Makes for a great movie!

I can't wait until the third movie!  I know this will be a series I will enjoy!",1107648000,11,1482,4.101398601398602
2135847,5,B0002XK18Q,"Spider-Man 2 is what sequels should be! Sequeles are rarely even close to being as good as the first movie. But this is the best sequel ever! Infact, most movies should be this good. It may even be better than spider-man? Since they did not have to focus so much on introducing the charicters, they where able to write and produce a very good movie. It continues Peter Parkers dual identity and the problems he has with it. It introduces the next bad guy in the series. Doc Oc (Dr. octopus) whos evilness spins from his most recent scientific falure. Rent it, buy it, or get if for a gift today! - from [...]  movie reviews by a fan, not a critic.",1103155200,5,647,4.30327868852459
2135848,5,B0002XK18Q,"I got this the other day, And it is GREAT! I won't get too much into the plot, since most everyone knows it. For a movie ""based on"" the comic book, it stays pretty faithful to the books. And the small changes and/or tweaks were just put in to bring the ""Spidy-joy"" to this generation. (remember Spider-man came out in the mid-sixties.)

The extras on this dvd (the ones I've experienced so far) are excellent to say the LEAST!

The ""pop up"" feature (where it puts out bits of trivia as the movie goes on)gives you excuse (as if you need one!) to watch it yet again!

short biographies of the comic Spidey's villians,and girlfriends.

The list goes on and on and on!!

Long story short, Get this 2-pack as soon as you can!!!",1102032000,5,723,4.365671641791045
2135849,5,B0002XK18Q,"Sam Rami needs to be congratulated on making a film that totally outdoes its predecessor.  Tobey McGuire is great and is one of the most likeable characters (re: Peter Parker) that I have seen in a film in a long time.  Alfred Molina is great as one of the more charismatic villains that have ever been portrayed on the screen.  I found myself cheering several times throughout the movie.

Peter Parker can't seem to hold a job (he's killing a pizza business that promises on-time delivery or it's free), his grades are stumbling (his extra-curricular activities as Spiderman keep him from being prepared for Dr. Connors class) and he keeps disappointing the woman he loves (he can't even show up to her Broadway performance).  He lives in a squalid one-room apartment and the landlord is constantly screaming at him for his rent while the landlord's daughter keeps staring longingly at him.  Everything comes to a head when Mary Jane announces that she is getting married to J. Jonah Jameson's son.

Peter starts blaming Spiderman for all his woes and as a result his powers seem to slowly ebb from him.  He makes a decision to go against the promise he made to his dead Uncle Ben and decides to toss out his Spiderman suit and try to lead a normal life.

He seems to be doing better in school and during a very hilarious sequence he struts around to the tune of Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head (reminiscent of a famous old movie).

Meanwhile, Dr. Octavius has been turned into a supervillain (thanks to some computer controlled mechanical arms that have attached themselves to him and taken over his mind because of an accident during a scientific experiment).  Octavius, now Dr. Octopus, is on a crime wave to get the materials he needs to crate a nuclear reactor that could wipe out the city.

A heart-to-heart talk with Aunt May and an attack by Dr. Octopus on the woman he loves, makes Peter realize that he must honor his motto (with great power, comes great responsibility) and become Spiderman once more.",1095379200,7,2015,4.693181818181818
