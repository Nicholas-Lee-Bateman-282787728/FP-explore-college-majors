7900833,3,7885881105,"Anyone interested in the work of one of Japan's greatest director should see this beautifully crafted 1941 film. The question is whether it is worth purchasing this particular DVD version. I am not in a position to know what other prints exist or the quality of what's available in DVD in other versions (the BFI has put out a version which may be worth exploring), but if this is the best available it is sad indeed. The picture and sound quality are poor and the image is considerably cropped. The English subtitles, for those who do not speak Japanese, are often inaccurate. For these reasons I could only give this product 3 stars, even though the film itself is worth a full house.",1390521600,5,686,4.585365853658536
