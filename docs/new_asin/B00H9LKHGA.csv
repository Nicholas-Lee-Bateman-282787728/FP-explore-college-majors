6149038,5,B00H9LKHGA,"With ""True Blood"" on hiatus, ""Treme"" in its final season and ""RuPaul's Drag Race"" on season break, ""Masters of Sex"" came along at the right time. Lizzy Caplan's huge beautiful and sensitive eyes makes her immediately intriguing. I think Michael Sheen and Ms. Caplan create an exciting team. Knowing that somewhere down the line, the two real life characters, do fall in love and marry so I found myself looking for clues for their romantic inter loping to transpire and sure enough it was quite easy to detect.
The way they handled the possibility of interracial intimacy was part sensual and part tasteful.

Much like my addiction to ""True Blood"", I waited anxiously for Sunday night after viewing each episode 2 or 3 times immediately.

The script was very well written far beyond the performances, the writers wrote very compelling dialogue and situations.

The producers also handled various aspects of same sex love with respect and no prejudice. For even though it was set in the late 50s/early 60s, the first scenes are set on the edges of the sexual revolution.

Its great to hear that Showtime is finally renewing the series. However, the fact that they still haven't schedule a DVD release, is most definitely a mystery.",1390176000,9,1230,4.899038461538462
6149039,5,B00H9LKHGA,"Masters of Sex is my favorite show of 2013. It's eye opening to be shown a time when women had very few rights and almost no one had a clue about their sexuality or their own bodies for that matter. Michael Sheen and Lizzy Caplan are fantastic. Their chemistry is so palpable and their acting is top notch.

  Speaking of top notch Allison Janney is absolutely heart breaking in her role as the provost's wife. She makes you ache for her. The sadness of her situation is deeply felt thanks to her incredible acting. She moved me to tears more then once. I loved her performance.

This show despite it's time frame is so relevant today. We owe a lot to the brave research of Masters and Johnson. Master's of Sex brings their lives and struggles to life in such a well done manner. I absolutely cannot wait for Season Two to begin!",1389052800,54,829,4.398692810457517
6149040,5,B00H9LKHGA,"Dr. William Masters wants to know what happens to the body during sex. To find out, he and his assistant, Virginia Johnson begin to observe anonymous couples and singles as they engage in various kinds of sex. But things get complicated when Masters and Johnson decide to participate in their own study.

Michael Sheen is dead on as the coldly serious William Masters. He deserves his Golden Globe nomination and if there is any justice should win. Lizzy Caplan as Virginia Johnson exhibits a warmth unknown to her counterpart. They are opposites driven by a common goal. Caplan should have been nominated for a Golden Globe and should have won. How could she have been overlooked? For me, the Golden Globes have lost all credibility. Masters of Sex is easily the best dramatic series on television.",1388880000,52,799,4.875

6149042,4,B00H9LKHGA,"Having watched this series on Showtime, my take is that it has several near-perfect characters--""Johnson"" is absolutely fabulous, ""Masters"" is right up there, and a good number of the subsidiary characters such as Beau Bridges' provost, his wife, the young doctor who almost marries their daughter, etc. are also superb.  But it is marred by a few over-the-top cartoon characterizations: Dr. Masters' mother, the airhead-blonde nurse who loves being part of the sex study, the provost's daughter.  They all play valuable roles and communicate good information, but they are lazy cliches.  But never mind, Lizzy Caplan (Johnson) is so talented that she can carry this series on her own.",1388707200,3,685,5.26605504587156
6149043,5,B00H9LKHGA,"A very entertaining,well written,well acted, and beautifully photographed TV series. It's interesting historically and shows what mores existed in the 50's and how people's lives were affected by them.",1387756800,4,201,5.9655172413793105

6149066,2,B00H9LKHGA,"Masters of Sex is Entertaining and a enjoyable show. Every actor and
actress except one was captivating and did an excellent job. Which
leads me to my next point....... The downfall is: every scene with
Virginia Johnson-Lizzy Caplan was very boring, very monotone. I
couldn't pay attention no matter how hard I tried to her scenes. They
where so bland and boring, she lost me after 5 seconds of talking. There
is no start quality or entertainment there. Every scene was her just rambling on and on with no emotion or change of tone in her voice at all, very very boring, enough to snooze on the spot. I forwarded it through many of her scenes  Sorry I am just telling the
truth. Caitlin FitzGerald would have did a much better job in that
role, she is very captivating, entertaining and a wonderful actress.

That was the biggest downfall for me about this show. Due to that ii
wouldn't be able to rewatch it like I would Mad Men or Boardwalk
Empire. Due to what is mentioned above I had to rate it at a 4 otherwise
I would have rated it at a 8, its just too many scenes are bland, as
she plays one of the main characters, which is sad, the right actress
in that role would have made this series a smash hit!",1506902400,,1208,4.317180616740088

6149069,3,B00H9LKHGA,"Masters of Sex is very much like other box set series taking place in the 1950's. Entertainment values compete with historical accuracy. The temptation to rewrite the 1950's to match feminist and civil rights agendas must be overwhelming.
St Louis Mo. was a very conservative, Catholic city in that era. To keep such a study under the radar required deft social and political connections. The lead characters are likeable but the petty infighting portrayed seems like soap opera.
Overall, the series is quite good but lacking historical consistency.",1500768000,,549,5.25
6149070,1,B00H9LKHGA,"Not sure I watched the same series as most of the other reviewers.  I never bonded with this one, although maybe it could have been a really good one.  Slow and except for Mrs. Johnson, wasn't interested in any of the characters.  They used modern language, too.  Many colloquialisms were not in use then, which is a pet peeve of mine and shows bad research or trying too hard to capture the 18-25yr old market.  I am not sure how you could create a whole series about M&J.  A movie, yes, but a series was forced.  If they were trying to do a Mad Men in the 50s they failed, plus the 50s were just not interesting.  I was a young kid but even I knew it was a boring, conformist decade!  They did show that it was repressed, but went overboard with that. Sex was not as mysterious as they portray here; the pill's sexual revolution didn't come out of nowhere.  And even my parents shared a bed.  The twin bed thing was for TV and movie censors, not reflective of real life, so hard to take this seriously as a period piece, which it clearly must be.",1499212800,2,1048,4.21608040201005

6149160,5,B00H9LKHGA,"I love shows that are complex but not pretentious, and I'd say that is exactly how I'd describe Masters of Sex. It explores history and social issues but not in a stuffy or uptight way, especially given that the story details the lives of Dr. William Masters and Virginia Johnson and their research of human sexuality. The biographical nature of the show doesn't take away from the drama or make it boring. The characters are portrayed by great actors and they are multi-dimensional. The writing is sharp. I'd recommend it.",1485043200,,523,4.822222222222222

6149163,5,B00H9LKHGA,I have only seen Season 1 to date.  Masters (Michael Sheen) with his scientific research on sex - drives the plot - however it is assistant Virginia (Lizzy Caplan) and wife Libby (Caitlin Fitzgerald) that make the story endlessly interesting and engaging.  Virginia is like a 21st century woman trapped in the stuffshirt 1950s - she holds our hand while we wince at the ideals that were so revered at the time.  And thank god for Martinis - when wife Libby cuts loose and gets to act.  Season 1 has 12 episodes in four 3 hour discs - it's hard to stop before you've finished one of the discs.,1484352000,,592,4.4036697247706424

I only saw a few commercials and of course by the name, i felt it was basically going to be just filled with endless soap opera drama/sex. But I was surprisingly astonished by the comical wit and just all around good story that it holds. I could see how some would not want to take a step in but this is bar far better than shows like Sex in the City. The actors are great and some of the scenarios they are put in brings so much laughter out of me. It is an emotional roller coaster though more laughs that unfortunate situations. You will fall in love with some of the characters, or at least I have. They are all very very good. I honestly love this show and I am hooked.

6149863,3,B00H9LKHGA,"Where to start? OK, going in I'd knew it'd more about the clinical aspects of sex given the series is about Masters and Johnson. Even so, the sex in this series is all very much bland and completely unsexy even away from the odd hook-up-the-electrodes sex table at the university. Also, were all white women in St. Louis in the '50s not exactly (forget even adding the adjective well-) endowed? I'm sorry, but what was up with the topless scenes-a-go-go given that fact?

Anyway, if you watched ""Mad Men"" you know all about the social mores of the '50s and '60s so this series is not really giving you new insight. There's even a gay-in-the-closet storyline that tells us not much more than we already knew from the gay adman who used to work for Sterling Cooper in ""Mad Men."" If it wasn't for the excellent acting performances, this thing would die on the vine. I found the storylines and script just so hackneyed. There are instances where things seem far too out of context and rushed (witness Allison Janney's character just up and having sex in the backseat with a doctor she meets outside a movie theater like it's the thing she'd do given the background and behavior of her up to that point). The whole engaged to a Jewish doctor candystriper encountering Hasidic Jews at a temple and having a meltdown afterwards was off the unintentional hilarity scale.

I get it, the '50s were different, but it's almost as if the creators wanted to stick every single stereotype in there for effect. All of these sidebar stories could have been handled far better than some sort of in-your-face out-of-the-blue events. I did muddle through to the end but I think I'm out on Season Two onwards. Just did not do much for me as you can pretty much see where this series is going. It's basically about relationships and the sex research is just secondary. That's fine but none of the relationships really grabbed me at all.

Note the extras on each DVDs you should skip till you watch the whole series as they give away bits of upcoming episodes.",1452211200,3,2037,4.621546961325967

6149892,5,B00H9LKHGA,"Welcome to the 1950s:  the utopia of the Republican party.  It was back when ""standard"" social mores were accepted, before the mass marketing of porn, and back when homosexuality was treated with electro-shock therapy.  Ah, yes, those were the days.  In the 1960s, the genie got out of the bottle in the form of the sexual revolution.  Ever since then, Conservatives have tried desperately to put the genie back in the bottle ~ to no avail.

When I 1st hear about this series, I assumed it would be a biographical docudrama of Alfred Kinsey.  Kinsey's pioneering research on sex related topics occured during the same time period;  he founded the Kinsey Institute @ the university of Indiana.  Instead. the main character is a fellow named Bill Masters (Mike Sheen) who seems to be based on Kinsey to some degree.

People who assume this series is thrown together as an excuse for lots of nudity are sure to be surprised by the depth of issues that the show delves into, such as cancer, women's health issues, the demonization of homosexuality, problems with efforts to conceive a child and the tragedy of infant mortality.  To be sure, there is a good amount of naked bodies (THANK YOU Lizzy Caplan!) but there are also entire episodes w/out any nudity whatsoever.  On the whole, the SPARTACUS series actually had a lot more scintillating scenes than MASTERS OF SEX.

The acting is impeccable.  Mike Sheen delivers a fine performance as a ""mad scientist"" type of OB/GYN who is both eccentric & stoic.  Bill Masters has a gorgeous wife, and yet he has little else but apathy for her physically.  He is obsessed with studying sex, and yet he is disinterested in having intercourse with his beautiful bride.  That's odd.  Lizzy Caplan is wonderful as his trusted assistant, Virginia.  Lizzy has an all-American girl-next-door beauty & she's built like a cheerleader, which makes her PERFECT for this part!

If you are looking for a series that is daring and has both beauty & brains, then this is a series that is worth looking into!  If you want to see the 1950s as depicted in LEAVE IT TO BEAVER then it's best to leave this series alone as you're not gonna like what you see.",1443657600,,2176,4.703703703703703
6149893,5,B00H9LKHGA,"I had to binge watch this season as well as the 2nd season! So good! For anyone scared away by the title, yes, there is sex in the show and lots of nudity, but I feel the series does a good job of balancing the sensual with the scientific and making the show have a point other than trying to be sexy (and not every episode is full of naked bodies). The characters explore every topic of sex that society is afraid to be open about--for many people even today! It is so funny what misconceptions people had about sex and how the male and female bodies operate--that is before studies began like those by Dr. Masters and Virginia Johnson. I'm inspired by the strong female lead and all the social difficulties she confronts. The show is great about going into depth in not just the female psyche, but the male psyche as well. Several male characters struggle with what it means to be a man in the 1950s and 1960s. Virginia herself struggles with who she is and wants to be and what society tells her she should be. Both Dr. Masters and Virginia also pave the way for people to talk about sex openly. They show that sex and sexuality is part of being human. It's part of science and psychology. Take a chance on this show! You'll be hooked!",1443225600,3,1238,4.3405172413793105

6149897,5,B00H9LKHGA,"""Masters of Sex"" - Season 1 is more than just sex. This great show based on real-life Midwestern sex researchers, William Masters and Virginia Johnson also has a brain. Of course there are a lot of sex scenes, but I like how the dark and complex the writing is. My favorite episode from Season 1 is ""Catherine"". Such a heartbreaking episode. The scene at the end where Bill breaks down and cries is gut-wrenching. Bill is played brilliantly by English actor, Michael Sheen. His American accent is flawless. Prior to ""Masters of Sex"", I've seen Sheen in various movies and I always thought there was something intriguing about his acting style. And let's not leave out the equally brilliant, Lizzy Caplan who plays Virginia. She's got incredible acting chops. She's a beautiful, fearless actress. The chemistry between Michael and Lizzy is electric. One of the best shows on t.v. Season 2 is just as good. I highly recommend it! Enjoy.",1441843200,,934,4.84375

Their growing intimacy is very powerful--I particularly loved the episode ""Fight,"" which had Masters teaching Caplan how to box. Such a complex story--and the total ignorance of the subject such a few short decades ago is staggering. Also, the lack of interest in ""women's"" cancers. Some of the episodes are hilarious and some are hard to watch, for their cruel truths--like the father who could not handle is son's ambiguous genitalia, and just wanted the child's ""thing"" cut off.

The series is based on the ground-breaking research on human sexuality by William Masters (Michael Sheen) and Virginia Johnson (Lizzy Caplan). Season One focuses on the beginning of the research and how Virginia came to be part of this project. As the research progresses, the on-screen chemistry between the two begins to ignite. Period-specific details are impressive as well as the zeitgeist of the 50s regarding sex. Michael Sheen (Far From the Madding Crowd) captures Dr. Masters brilliantly as a researcher, a husband, and man with all the internal and external conflicts that go with his research. Lizzy Kaplan captures Virginia Johnson as an emerging woman in her own right and her smoldering sexuality erupts while she remains compellingly feminine.

6150232,5,B00H9LKHGA,"1956. William Masters is a doctor working at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. Masters is a brilliant researcher in the field of fertility but is also working on a more pioneering project: the first-ever detailed study of the biology of human sexuality. With his superiors scandalised by the project, Masters recruits singer-turned-secretary Virginia Johnson to assist him.

Masters of Sex is a show based around an interesting, but surely limited, premise: what happened when the first American doctor tried to investigate the real biological processes involved during sex? Given this was the mid-1950s when homosexuality was still illegal, censors had a big problem with Elvis Presley's hips and society was dumbfounded when a woman expressed a desire to have a career, the answer is scandal, outrage and secrecy. It took a full decade for Masters and Johnson to finally publish their findings in the more liberal and free-swingin' 1960s, as they waited for society to catch up to the point where it could handle the facts their study revealed.

As the show starts that's a far bit off in the future. Instead, it initially comes across as a sexier version of Mad Men, with the furnishings, fashions and cars of the 1950s recreated with impeccable precision and the mores and limitations of society of the time evoked and then cast down thanks to the freedom of cable television, namely nudity and sex. You may have gathered from the premise that there's a lot flesh on display in this series and this is the case, although probably nowhere near as much as some were expecting. Masters of Sex is a show about sex and desire, but it's even more about the impact it has on people, its use as a motivation or goal and the hypocrisises of a society that is both defined by it but also likes to pretend it doesn't exist.

These complexities are realised fully by the actors. We already knew that Michael Sheen was one of the best actors of his generation, but just in case there was any doubt he completely knocks it out of the park in his portrayal of Masters. Masters is a buttoned-up figure who is a lot more complex and conflicted than it first appears. He proclaims his belief that sex is a purely biological process with scientific processes behind it and that love and emotion does not necessarily play a role, but he then expresses disgust with the notion of homosexuality (something the triggers some later self-analysis) and develops problems separating his own feelings from the work. He has a difficult relationship with his wife Libby (a soulful performance by Caitlin Fitzgerald), being cold and distant despite her warmth and attentiveness, but develops an interest in Virgina when she earns his respect through applying herself to the study in a serious manner. Sheen does sterling work throughout the series, making Masters constantly sympathetic and understandable even when he's acting like an insensitive fool (which is about two-thirds of the time).

Playing against him and more than holding her own is Lizzy Caplan. Caplan has been building up a good body of work in supporting roles in various projects over the last decade or so, but Masters of Sex is finally the big break-out role she was waiting for. Virginia Johnson is a modern woman trapped in the wrong time period: a young woman forced by circumstance (separating from her boorish, unreliable boyfriend and the father of her two children) and will into developing a career of her own at a time when this was extremely rare. Johnson's role is contrasted against that of Dr. DePaul (Julianne Nicholson), a woman who has made it in the male-dominated world of medicine but only at the expense of having any kind of family life and still struggles to get respect or her projects funded. Initially the two women develop an adversarial relationship, but later on find themselves joining forces, united in their exasperation of the world.

A galaxy of fine supporting actors prop up the central cast. Beau Bridges is the sort of actor you call on to appear as an avuncular authority figure, which he does well here as the university provost and Masters's mentor, but the writers then make him a closeted gay man struggling with his identity and with his relationship with his wife and daughter. It's a more angsty role than it first appears and Bridges plays it to the hilt, seemingly enjoying stretching his range. Allison Janney gives a terrific performance as his wife, who is initially horrified at discovering her husband's infidelity but then feels liberated by it to pursue her own life.

Masters of Sex (*****) is a clever show, exploring gender issues, social mores and how people are defined by their desires through the central premise. It's deftly-characterised and filmed with real attention to period detail. It's also extremely funny at times, gut-wrenchingly tragic at others and always fascinating to watch. It also ties with Game of Thrones for the best title sequence currently on television.",1420502400,2,4995,4.933412604042807

6150240,5,B00H9LKHGA,"Masters of Sex is a show about the famous 1950s study on human sexuality by Dr William Masters (played by Michael Sheen) and Virginia Johnson (played by Lizzy Caplan).  It is a fictionalized version of the events surrounding the study, with true elements woven into the story.  Like most of the cable shows the season is relatively short, just 12 episodes, but it packs a lot of story lines into the season.  Some of them get resolved, some are left open and some are even cliffhangers leading into season 2.

What makes the show work is the quality writing and acting.  Sheen is great as the sometimes distant, sometimes off-putting  often times arrogant and sometimes very emotional Masters.  He plays the character very buttoned up, but in the moments where he has to let loose with any kind of emotion he does it very well.  Likewise, Caplan is great as Johnson a mother of two, who has no qualifications to assist in a medical study yet, in part because of the controversial nature of the work, manages to get herself a position first as Master's secretary, then as an assistant.  The two have seemingly great chemistry and portray the ups and downs of the relationship between Masters and Johnson extremely well.  Aside from the two leads all the ancillary characters and the actors playing them are done almost perfectly.

The show does a great job of capturing the backdrop of the 1950s, from the absurdity of the duck and cover nuclear drills, to women's role in society vs men's roles, a hint of the racial divide that existed then (and still does in some way today) and so on.  The show even explores the issue of homosexuality involving one of the main characters and his effort to ""cure"" himself.  It also explored the science vs society debate that is still raging today.

The show does have a lot of sex and nudity in it, obviously, but it is not there just for the sake of having sex in the show.  But for some that will make them just as uncomfortable as it did back in the 50's so if you are one you probably will want to skip this.  While there certainly are some soap opera like elements to parts of the stories, that part is toned down quite a bit, so if you hate soap opera like shows, be they daytime or prime time, don't worry about this one.

For those who get the blu ray set, the show looks and sounds great.  For extras there are deleted scenes for select episodes, and making of and behind the scenes material spread across the three discs.  Probably about an hours worth of extras all totaled.  Enough to keep those who like going through the bonus material happy.  If you have heard great things about the show but have not yet checked it out, I would definitely recommend it.",1420070400,,2707,4.506147540983607

It's amazing how little people understood about sex, masturbation and women's bodies back then! OMG, I could never have lived in that time period, I would have been as unconventional as Virginia Johnson because otherwise I might kill myself. So much oppression and ignorance around the clitoris, female orgasm and chemistry. Makes me so sad for my parents and grandparents generations. It's like women's pleasure and sexuality didn't even exist to anyone back then. It kills me how many story lines were around women faking orgasm and/or men assuming they just don't have them and women assuming they can't. I have so much respect for Masters and Johnson for pushing this study against all support from their peers, exploring, pioneering this topic and educating people of something so important! This is your body and so many people back then, and today I suspect, know so little about it. If men watched this show they would realize that whatever they think they know about women's bodies from their lame online porn habit is leading them down a sad and ignorant path.

I do have one complaint: It kills me that in a show about sex and orgasms, we never see penis. Why? Why!? Why!? Come on! Lots of breasts and women masturbating, but no penis. I don't get it. Maybe that's coming up in future episodes!?!?

If you are a super prude, uncomfortable with your body or the idea of people getting off either with others or by themselves, then you will not enjoy this show. Which is a shame, because you need it the most. This is history, it's real and a well written ,well acted story.",1417824000,,1797,4.753205128205129

Between the overacted faux-gasms in the brothel to the decidedly skewed top-heavy nudity favoring only young attractive women, the whole point of the experiments that are the crux of this show is lost.

The acting is equally yawn-worthy for the most part, often not especially convincing or interesting. Overall, I only gave this 2 stars rather than 1 because it was too boring to hate.",1415750400,5,645,4.908256880733945

It seemed lackluster if one is to appreciate a fully rich experience however if you could get past that they did demonstrate how a lack of inhibition and enthusiasm between people certainly improves the mechanics. Additionally they seem to demonstrate the mechanics of sex regardless of the attachments of the parties involved to the point of suggesting encouragement.

Like Mad Men, it successfully weaves contemporary issues and attitudes of a bygone era into the narrative. MoS surpasses Mad Men in that it is based on two pioneers from American history. Some may say that telling a story incorrectly is worse than not telling it at all, but at least the screenwriters know how to make a story come to life. Unfortunately there are many aspects in this portrayal of Johnson and Masters that had to be invented (history has its gaps, especially when covering subjects that were taboo at the time).

Not just sex but everything. I'm 73 and grew up during that time period and the show brings back painful memories of what it was like growing up female in a time when men completely ruled women and what they did with their bodies.

A enjoyable theatrical education on the secrets of the time.

P.S. As a clinician working with traumas and their individual and social consequences, I am recommending this series, and Season Two in particular as an excellent teaching tool for the intricacies of trauma, sex, social change and the inhibitions we and our society suffer in our efforts to live and do better.

6150736,4,B00H9LKHGA,"Masters of Sex is a well-written, engaging, and fascinating story of the groundbreaking researchers in human sexuality well-known to most of us by their surnames Masters and Johnson. Masters, played with cool and detached precision by Michael Sheen, is written as a brilliant ob-gyn, albeit arrogant, controlling, and manipulative when it comes to his career and his relationships. There are hints at dark areas in his upbringing, but otherwise, he walks a line between despicable and admirable.  This is a tough sell for a lead character, but HBO did it with Al Swearengen in Deadwood, so I'm hoping for a similar character arc. Over the final few episodes of Season One, the writers thankfully fleshed Masters out beyond the rather unsavory and emotionally undeveloped person he'd been through the initial eight-to-ten episodes. If the show is to truly achieve greatness, they'll need to continue giving the audience a reason to emotionally invest in him.

Virginia Johnson, as played to perfection by Lizzy Caplan, is the more complete character; a free-thinking, sexually liberated, hard-working, single mother who moves quickly from the secretarial pool to Master's indispensable research partner. Johnson is far more open-minded than her female peers and a woman who eschews traditional female roles of the period. She leaves her children in a baby sitter's care most of the time, and is career-driven in a manner that won't become commonplace for at least another decade. Indeed, she serves as an ideal vehicle to address feminism; one of the social causes the show takes on (race relations and sexual preference being others). Taking full advantage of the period (the 1960s), the show rightfully places Masters & Johnsons' work alongside other powerful forces that made this era such a turbulent and transformative one in American history.

Veteran actors Beau Bridges and Allison Janney play the university provost husband and his wife, the former possessing a secret and the latter struggling with the consequences, and in the process shedding her innocence. They are both played brilliantly and provide the most fully-realized characters.

The downside is that the secondary characters aren't nearly as strong as the abovementioned quartet. Johnson's ne'er do well musician ex-husband and the young doctor who falls for her are both silly clich&eacute;s (particularly the ex-husband), as are the quirky secretary/research volunteer, the embittered, man-hating doctor with a chip on her shoulder, the sex-crazed doctor who seems to get together with just about everyone on the show, and the AV geek who arrives near the season's midpoint. To be fair, in a twelve episode premier season, one can only adequately develop a few characters, so I look forward to seeing these others achieve their potential. An oddity is Masters' wife, played well by Caitlin Fitzgerald, but written with frustrating inconsistency. She is tentative and uncertain about what she wants out of life, and even an overly-simplistic moment of candor with her mother-in-law (another stock character) sheds little light on what's in her heart and soul. There are moments when I think a big revelation is coming, but it never materializes. Perhaps this is intentional, but either way, I find her lightweight and uninteresting.

Like another recent Showtime drama Penny Dreadful, they share the problem of two-dimensional characters and unnecessary clich&eacute;s. Yet both shows have enough strength and a huge upside to make me very excited about season two. Many great series take a season or two to fully blossom and I'm confident Masters of Sex (and Penny Dreadful) will only get better.",1406592000,,3670,5.309810671256455
6150737,5,B00H9LKHGA,"I am on season 3, STILL looking forward to each episode.  The writing has not lost steam--and it is getting better!  This show evolves into the most poignant, touching, interesting, and romantic masterpiece.  You have to do yourself a favor and see it all.  Every character is played by a masterful actor or actress--even the extras.  Masters and Virginia's relationship grows suspenseful, complex and meaningful.  The chemistry between these two actors is amazing.

If you enjoy learning about sex as it was once viewed, following multifaceted characters who manifest both flaws and heroic traits, and witnessing a plot that wraps you in gentle twists every episode, WATCH MASTERS OF SEX.

6150740,5,B00H9LKHGA,"I was really surprised to learn that the career of Masters and Johnson was made into a Showtime original series. The writers, producers and actors have provided the audience with an incredibly high caliber show.

It's not an easy task to take such a sensitive subject, especially one that involves the lives of real people, and make it into a successful and highly regarded TV series. If an attempt was made just a few years ago to come out with a series like this, I'm sure that those promoting it would have been called crazy.

The fact that it deals with real life explicit sexual situations is reason enough for a TV network to say no to a proposal such as this. After all, the FCC wouldn't allow it to be broadcast over the regular airways. Thank goodness that Showtime stood up to the plate, as the actors in this series make for an extremely compelling and entertaining show.

From the pilot, right through all of the episodes of season one, my wife and I have been captivated and mesmerized by the nature of this series. This is as real as it gets. I can guarantee that you'll be hooked after watching the very first episode(pilot) of this incredible series. It's first rate throughout.",1406332800,4,1194,4.570093457943925

All of the discs have different pictures of the two main characters rather than any of the other ones, and the menus are plain, still, and don't even have any music.

As far as the show goes, it's ingenious. A bit heavy handed at times, but through and through a gripping drama that remains faithful to its characters. I don't think I could put it over Getting On or Rectify in terms of best new show of 2013. But it's close.",1406160000,,566,4.339622641509434

6150744,5,B00H9LKHGA,"At times, I look at Yahoo news online and my free local newspaper for ideas on what might be good to watch (in ways of television and/or movies).  However, I have to credit finding out about Masters Of (starring Martin Sheen and Lizzy Caplan) through Entertainment Weekly magazine around 3-4 weeks ago. I was looking through Entertainment Weekly magazine during one of my scheduled lunch breaks during my overnight shift at work when I spotted an article about the Masters Of  television show (starring Martin Sheen and Lizzy Caplan) and pictures of scenes from the show. The author of the article wrote it in a way that persuaded me to know more about the show and eventually purchased the dvd on July 3, 2014. The twelve episodes keep one at suspense and the dvd has a jacket that features a brief summary of what each of the 12 episodes are about. Please know that I only have the intent of respect for their real-life partners. However, the scenes of some of the research work going on between Martin Sheens character of Dr. Masters and Lizzy Caplans character of Virginia Johnson highlight strong chemistry and an off the chart dose of intense passion/ steam. Beau Bridges, Caitlin Fitzgerald, Teddy Sears, and Nicholas DAgosto are listed on the back of the dvd as some of the actors and actresses on Masters Of(the third word is left out due the fact that Im concerned that writing the third word may clash with Amazons terms of profanity in written words) .  The back of the dvd also features pictures of the various actors and actresses that are featured in the show. The front of the dvd shows the picture of Martin Sheen as Dr. Masters and Lizzy Caplan as Virginia Johnson. There is a quoted text of the Rolling Stone magazine review of the Masters Of dvd calling this television show The Best New Show while the TV guide review on the back says stimulating and satisfying. Disc one contains the first three episodes, disco two features episodes 4-6, disc three has episodes 7-9, and the fourth disc has the last three episodes.  The following are the special features included within the four dvds for the Masters Of television show:

I had vaguely heard of the show but I guess I dismissed it because it sounded like a boring docudrama.  When Showtime ran a S1 marathon the weekend before the S2 premiere, I watched an episode out of idle curiosity and was immediately sucked in (heh).  One episode turned into seven or eight but I had started my binge-watching too late so I had to get caught up on Amazon Prime.  To give you an idea of just how good this show is, I don't pay $1.99 per episode unless I am well and truly hooked!

Masters of Sex reminds me a little of Mad Men (which is probably my favorite show of all time) in that it's a glimpse into the not-too-distant past.  If you're a fan of Mad Men, you will definitely like this show.  Masters of Sex is Mad Men on steroids!",1405296000,,839,4.173913043478261

The screen play is superb. The dialogue is so natural, compelling and smart. Of course in their lives these were all remarkable men and women living and working together.

A slice of life and a homage to the late fifties and the views regarding sex that were prevalent at that time in our country, the USA, and the world. Men and women who are younger than forty will find it difficult to believe how ignorant people were regarding sexual response in men and women.

Masters and Johnson's work woke America up, if one only took the time to read the findings of the original study that was eventually published in a format that non-medical professionals were able to read and understand.

Looking forward to season two of Masters of Sex.

6150864,5,B00H9LKHGA,"As soon as I heard about this show, and saw a commercial, I couldn't wait for the moment it posted on Amazon Instant Video (since I don't have Showtime), and it was worth the wait. Every episode is exhilarating to watch, the characters have such a deep, rich story surrounding them (which I hope just reaches deeper as the seasons progress), and I enjoy every character. Every. single. one. Which is very rare for any show to convince me to like every character.

As an educated women, I still have learned vast amounts of information (especially about sex) while watching this show, and I now feel that my commitment will lead to reading all of the writings of Masters & Johnson. It is never to late to improve an already vibrant sex life, and this show really commits to the data of too much information about sexual intercourse is still not enough. The more, the better, and the better the information the more incredible the progress.

I have not enjoyed any show (and I watch many) as much as this one, and feel that it was worth every penny to watch instantly, and I am already prepared to order the dvd to share with as many family members and friends possible who I hope enjoy this as much as I have. Since I am only in episode 8 at this moment, I will end my review at this time. But, if in doubt about this show, I have found everything sexual to be presented very tastefully, and seemingly pro-woman throughout. It is well scripted, excellently filmed, and has such a strong female lead (actress playing Johnson) that I feel even more connected to watching this series than any other favorite show with a strong female character (ex. The Good Wife, Gilmore Girls, Sex & the City, Game of Thrones, etc.).",1404000000,3,1714,4.525806451612903
6150865,5,B00H9LKHGA,"Sex.

Let's just think about that word for a moment and what it means. To the world of today, sex seems to be just another word, because it pervades every part of our life; our literature, our news, our culture. in the world of this show though, set in the 1950's, sex was something that married people did merely to conceive a child, and no one EVER talked about it, much less studied it. However, when William Masters and Virginia Johnson started their pioneering work at Washington University, they were on the edge of a revolution that would change the way that couples all over the country regarded sex. And while this is the basis for Showtime's brilliant new drama MASTERS OF SEX, it's only part of what the show is actually about, which is one of the things that makes it so good.

Masters (the brilliant Michael Sheen) is one of the country's leading obstetricians, celebrated to his abilities to help couples conceive. He won't deny anyone his care. His brilliance also has led him to become incredibly arrogant and dismissive. His wife Libby (Caitlin Fitzgerald) is an intelligent, beautiful, and somewhat antiseptic woman who is proud of her husband but ashamed of herself in her inability to conceive for him, believing she's incapable of pregancy. Masters' young protege, Dr. Ethan Haas (Nicholas D'Agosto) is a amazing young surgeon who is looking for the right woman. Due to the nature of his work, Masters wants to begin an official study of sex and all its aspects with funding from the university, which goes right up against the grain of the medical school's provost, Barton Scully (Beau Bridges, in his best role in years). Enter Virginia Johnson (a phenomenal Lizzy Caplan), a former lounge singer with a deadbeat ex-husband and two young children who works in the secretarial pool at the university. She catches the eye of Haas with her beauty and modern attitudes and catches Masters with her out-of-the-box thinking in regards to his study. Suddenly, Masters has subjects that he can observe in the study, and Johnson is right there beside him, helping him gather more subjects and moving the research further. However, as their study intensifies, the other parts of their lives become more perfunctory.

Showrunner Michele Ashford, whose only previous recognizable work is being on the writing and producing staff of the HBO series THE PACIFIC, shows that she is more than capable of handling the multitude of characters and plotlines while making sure that all of them get their due. If the show were run with a different sensibility, though, it would be far easier to sell the show merely based on the steamier side of the premise, but while the show does have a steamy side, the sex of the show never seems gratuitous. MASTERS OF SEX prefers to stick with the characters, and leaving the characters propelling the plot forward instead of the other way around. And the performers playing these characters are all pretty much perfect. Sheen and Caplan are amazing as Masters and Johnson, and their chemistry together is so incredibly unforced that it seems like they've been working together for ages. Fitzgerald is another shining star of this show as Libby. The show never forces her character into a cliche, and she plays her with gravitas and melancholy. Another great supporting performance is Julianne Nicholson as Dr. Lillian DePaul, another obstetrician who is trying to make the same strides that Masters is in regards to female health, but being a woman in the 50's wasn't easy, and Nicholson again takes a character that could have been cliched and gives her a fully realized and three-dimensional performance. The brightest supporting stars of the show, though, turn out to be Bridges and Allison Janney, who plays his wife Vivian. The arc these characters have is possibly the most moving and honest of the show so far.

What also makes the show so unique and so great is how the female characters are so fully fleshed-out, which sadly is something that you don't see often in most forms of entertainment. It also marks another show in Showtime's repetoire with an incredible female lead, like Claire Danes in HOMELAND and Eva Green in PENNY DREADFUL. Caplan's performance deserves to be spoken of alongside the likes of Danes, Green, and ORPHAN BLACK's brilliant Tatiana Maslany.

From a writing and directing standpoint, the show fires on all cylinders. They never go for cheap and sleazy, but rather for introspection and examination. To be sure, there is a lot of sex on this show, but some of it is almost clinical in its observation when necessary, or is highly erotic and sensuous. There's also a good degree of humor to the show, but when the characters suffer and are at odds, you feel it as keenly as any great drama.

MASTERS OF SEX is easily one of the best new shows on television this year, and might even have been the very best, if this had also not been the year of TRUE DETECTIVE.",1403654400,37,4938,4.8240850059031875

6150870,5,B00H9LKHGA,"I watched the first episode of this show thinking that the scientific sex studies of Masters & Johnson was not likely to be riveting fare.  The main reason I tuned in was that I have loved Michael Sheen in absolutely everything he's ever done. Why he wanted to play Bill Masters was beyond me but as an actor, he is first rate. Within five minutes, I knew I was seeing the best new series of the year. Bill Masters, the leading star OB-GYN at his hospital in Missouri, is a frustrated guy.  This is because he has never wanted to be just a super successful doctor. No, for years he has been solidifying his position because he wants to do research into human sexuality. Everyone in medicine and research, however, is dead set against him.  He has the absolutely wrong personality to try and get subjects to loosen up potential recruits.  He is stiff, pedantic, arrogant and wholly lacking in magnetism. Enter Virginia Johnson, who becomes his secretary. He is no dummy.  He can see that Johnson is probably as smart as he plus she is wonderful with people and is charismatic as can be.  Plus she is wildly sexy. With that we are off and running as Masters and Johnson becomes every kind of story you could wish for, about sex, medicine, love, romance, family and all the nastier emotions which run alongside those things. Lizzie Kaplan is every bit as wonderful as Sheen. Really, drop everything you are doing and get this series.  What a windfall!

Maybe it doesn't completely capture the zeitgeist of 1950's, but it's hard to imagine any real context for what they achieved, even 60+ years later.

It's takes place on the cusp of the sexual revolution and the nascent women's movement, as regards to parity in sexuality, academia, and science.

8631258,3,B00H9LKHGA,"I was very much looking forward to this series. I liked the film Kinsey, about another pioneering figure in sexuality research. There are many interesting parts to it, like how the research was started in that time period, the shenanigans they had to go through to keep it going. The downside is the excessive focus on cheating, deception, and infidelity. Not just Masters & Johnson but other characters too. Infidelity is a part of human sexual behavior--I get it. And it's important that they include that and emphasize this in the show. But by the second season, I found myself getting disgusted with M&J, in a kind of poop-or-get-off-the-pot way. So if you want to watch people wallow in their own emotional sleaze, then I recommend this for you. Otherwise, you may find yourself getting a little tired of this. It's unfortunate since Michael Sheen's performance is really good, as is that of the other actors. This would have worked much better as a movie or a short series (~5-6 episodes). But that's just my personal opinion.",1518566400,,1032,4.836158192090395
