7984250,3,B00008G97U,"I bought this because it features Maria Ford, and because it's a stripping movie, and because it's Maria Ford featured in a stripping movie (in the lead as ""Shady""). I mean come on...this is Maria's genre.

However, this isnt' one of her better offerings. She spends most of the movie whining and running around with that dumb open-mouthed expression on her face. You know the one if you're a Maria Ford fan. Only this time around she has red hair.

Unfortunately we never get the chance to find out if the carpet matches the drapes, and that's my biggest gripe. Full frontal has been the hallmark of Maria's best work. And if we don't get that, we nearly always get her amazing on-screen fake climaxes, which in the '90s were the best in the biz.

Doing a little research I found out why we dont' see that stuff in this movie, and that's because it actually is Maria's FIRST credited movie role, from way back in 1988. So she hadn't yet had time to develop her acting chops, and the genre hadn't become what it did later under her leadership.

All of that stated, it isn't a bad little movie for what it is. What really makes it a solid three stars is the relationship of the law-enforcement officers. The writing for them is witty and the delivery is funny.

The stripping scenes never make it above moderate on the sliding scale, so don't expect much out of that...although all of the actresses look good and NONE of them have breast implants (as you would expect from a movie released in the late '80s). That's wonderful as far as I'm concerned.

Considering that you'll find this one in the bargain bin, it's worth a buy, particularly if you're a Maria Ford kind of guy.",1256342400,7,1675,4.493421052631579
7984251,4,B00008G97U,Exotic dancers are being murdered and it's up to a cop (Eb Lottimer) to track down the killer. His prime suspect is a beautiful dancer named Shady (Maria Ford pre-boob job) whom he is also lusting after. Shady is caught up in the investigation as well as trying to hold off the sexual advances of some of her female coworkers. So the question is: is Shady killing these girls? There are a lot of topless scenes. This movie also features B-movie queen Debra Lamb doing a fire breathing act. Pretty good.,1072137600,22,502,4.527472527472527
