8597560,1,B00DTG4VK2,"I was very disappointed.  I understood that the disk would basically be raw combat cameraman footage, but I assumed it would cover a much greater portion of the timeframe during which the unit was in combat.  The disk for the 104th only contains a smattering of footage shot during about 2 months in the fall of 1944.  Given the short duration of the coverage that should be noted to the buyer.  Also, while I appreciate the effort that went into gathering the archival footage, the disk contains merely a smattering.  $25 is a bit much for what was provided.",1389398400,2,559,4.606060606060606
