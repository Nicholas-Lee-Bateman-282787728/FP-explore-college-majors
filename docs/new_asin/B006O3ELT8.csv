The young protagonist is attracted to his aunt's eccentricities and overall careless attitude toward life, and, as he emerges from his shell, she sinks further into alcoholism and self-destructiveness, in general.

The director frames the film with beauty and symmetry. This movie is yet another example of the ability of French directors to capture alienation, ennui, and taboo subjects such as this aunt-and-nephew dynamic. It has a very anti-bourgeois tone throughout, adding to its quirky charm.

I will always remember the nephew's and aunt's walks through the park, as the leaves fall about their path.",1373155200,3,690,5.4392523364485985
