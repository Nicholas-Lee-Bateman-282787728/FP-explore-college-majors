I guess it was showing his range, but it was harder to get interested in the two leads in this one. I guess he's supposed to be playing a simple guy that has been damaged. Gardening seemed to save him. And the girl lead was self-serving, which she changes during the story. But the acting was a little farcical, reminding me of sitcom acting like from the 70s and 80s in the States. Three's Company came to mind, where it seems a little unrealistic by their interactions. But overall, it was nice to get through. But I really like No Min Woo in characters that suits his talents, singing and exploits his good looks.",1485734400,,778,4.335616438356165
