7822033,4,6302142342,"This takes me WAY WAY Back and I loved going to Reba concerts. I only wish it was on DVD or Blu-ray so I could keep it for years to come and enjoy it.

She is the queen of country music for sure. Not just because of her awesome un-mistakable vocals, but also because of the shows she put on, TV, Broadway, and the awesome music videos that she produced. I remember watching CMT for hours just to see one of her videos before the internet ;) haha

I got this to hopefully transfer to a DVD to keep.",1363219200,,497,4.01010101010101
7822034,5,6302142342,"Great concert... the picture is a bit fuzzy, but it's also on VHS! No complaints here - glad to have it to add to my collection! Only disappointment was that she doesn't wear the dress on the VHS cover in the actual concert that's on the video. Greatest part is that she talks and doesn't just sing!",1223424000,2,299,4.2631578947368425
7822035,4,6302142342,"This video, filmed in Texas, features Reba and her back-up band that died in a 1991 plane crash. She dedicates this performance to their memory. It is not ""big production Reba"", but rather just lights a band and three costume changes - but this was quite a show for 1990! She sings a few hits from the just-then released ""Rumor Has It"" album, as well as all of her great hits up to that time. It's a must have for any Reba fan!",1088035200,5,427,4.156626506024097
