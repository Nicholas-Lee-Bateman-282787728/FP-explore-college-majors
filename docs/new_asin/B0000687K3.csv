Its so ""lol"" hilarious you have to see it to believe it. Watch Nino, with one good eye, take some quality time to discern whether an item picked up off the ground is his lost shoe or a rat.
I'm still working on my old vhs to dvd, which is watchable, but Its a shame this hasn't been released on dvd in the US. When it is, i'll be the first to buy it.",1323648000,3,494,3.8058252427184467
7964059,5,B0000687K3,"Down and Dirty is a better title for this DVD.  A somewhat crude look at life in the slums of Rome.  Very funny in its way.  You should know Italian and maybe Portuguese, since the dialog is in Italian and the subtitles are in Portuguese.",1226793600,,238,4.2444444444444445
7964060,5,B0000687K3,"You may consider a bit exaggerate this statement but with just only six notable exceptions in all the story's cinema I had not ever seen such portrait which showed with dramatic precision the real essence of the human misery.

Thanks to an admirable cast and an overwhelming and realistic, you will feel since the first shots the portentous camera work and the sordidness of this underworld in the same heart of the sacred Rome.

This movie is supported by smart Fellinian devices  the black humor and the unfinished irony in this unusual family where the fight for surviving will seal its own codes.

Nino Manfredi made one of his best performances ever.

Watch this powerful movie to realize how far can the reality surpass the fiction.

One of the top Italian films ever made!",1106956800,4,779,4.776119402985074
