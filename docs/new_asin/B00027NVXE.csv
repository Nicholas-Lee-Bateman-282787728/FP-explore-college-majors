2065509,3,B00027NVXE,"Gerald Butler is one of my favorite actors thus I was very excited about the re-release of this movie. However, the reviews I read about the movie did not paint an accurate picture about this movie. First, I do want to say that the movie was well done, the acting was excellent, it had soothing music, and the scenery was breathtaking. As for the story itself, it was depressing and I did not get sentimental at the end of the movie. Instead I was disgusted. I found the character Sarah an extremely self centered individual. In fact Charlotte summed up my take on things during the argument in the restaurant scene.

Sarah leaves Scotland to pursue her personal dreams in New York City. She leaves behind Sam, someone who has loved her since childhood. without so much as a thought. She returns to Scotland seven years later because she finds out she has an inoperable brain tumor. While she is healthy in New York she does not contact Sam or concern herself with his heartache. Upon returning, she seeks out Sam so that she will have someone in which to spend her last days. She brings with her ""a list"" of things she wants to do. She doesn't care that Sam is married and she expects the wife to just move over and let her have Sam to do ""the list"" of things with her.

While Sam may have once believed that Sarah was his ""perfect match"" that perfect match walked out on him. He chose to move on and make a committment to someone else. Charlotte adores her husband. What bothers me is the fact no one seems to care about her dreams. Charlotte has focused her life around Sam. (I guess that is her misfortune.)

Other reviews talk about how wonderful it is that Sam realizes what is important and he chooses to walk out on a wife he made a committment to and devote all his time to Sarah until she dies. Am I missing something here? All I could think of during this movie was what if I was the wife and not the long lost girlfriend? And I also kept thinking when Sam acted as if the wife was totally unreasonable, what if the situation was reversed? He would not have happily let her spend massive quality time with an exboyfriend! What I found really upsetting was when Charlotte bought the opera tickets for Sam's birthday because opera was a favorite of Sam's and she goes ahead to the theatre to wait for his arrival. The last she hears is that Sam WILL BE THERE. Sarah comes by the restaurant, sees that Sam is dressed to go out, but somehows manuevers him into staying at the restaurant and making a desert with her. Later he meets Sarah at a cottage where they have their ""one last kiss"". As for the wife, she is left at the opera by herself.

For Gerry fans, he does a wonderful job. But guys, he is playing a role and the guy he plays here broke his wife's heart. If Sam truly could not get over Sarah, he had no right involving Charlotte. How is it fair to her to just be there for Sam when Sarah is not around? And I guess I have a different concept of love than Sarah. I believe if she loved him more than herself, she would not have left him to begin with but once she did, she certainly would not have expected him to walk away from his marriage and spent all his time with her until she was no longer alive.",1150156800,14,3223,4.278688524590164
2065510,5,B00027NVXE,This is right up there with Love Story with a slightly different twist. I can't wait for the U.S. release because I can't watch my Region 2 anymore (technical difficulties) and I'm going through withdrawls. It will make you cry.,1146441600,7,228,4.725
2065511,2,B00027NVXE,"Girl learns that she is dying of a brain tumor so she decides to return to her home town after being away for years. Once home, she lifts her father out of his self induced torpor (commendable), joins a support group (understandable), and wrecks her old boyfriend's marriage (wha...?).

Slightly stupid but studly Sam has a nice business and a solid marriage with a wife who is also his business partner. He seems happy and successful until his old girlfriend reappears in his life. Amazingly, although she has a short time to live, she looks fit and healthy. (She must have had one of those Hollywood cancers, where the victim just gets more beautiful the sicker she becomes - think Ali McGraw in ""Love Story."") This vibrant, dying girl has a list of ""to do"" items, all of which seem to include Sam, never mind his restaurant or his wife.

A personal note here - my brother was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor when he was 48. He did not spend his last year skydiving or trying to reconnect with his old girlfriends, single or married. Instead, he did what he could to make sure that his affairs were in order and that his family was provided for. He did his best to create memories of a solid, sweet guy who thought more of those around him than of himself. And his body was ravaged by chemotherapy, radiation and gamma knife treatments. Only his courage made him beautiful. He died at 49.

But this dearly dying damsel is so wrapped up in her wants that she ignores the wreck of Sam's marriage and the shattered wife he abandons. And Sam! Sam needs a good swift kick. Maybe his marriage wasn't to his ""one twu wuv."" but his wife trusted and depended on him. As a result, she is made out to be the villain of the piece and actually spits on darling dying Dora. (In her place, I'd have given the nearly departed a knuckle sandwich.)

On the plus side, the movie showcases some lovely scenery, not the least of which is Gerard Butler. The man is smokin'! But the moral of the story? ""Take whatever you can get and damn the consequences,"" are not exactly words to live (or die) by.",1146355200,62,2088,4.443864229765013
2065512,4,B00027NVXE,"For all you Gerry Butler fans, and for those who enjoy drama with a cut of depressing humor this is not only the movie for you but a MUST BUY!  I'm serious buy it... buy it right now! Especially since you can now get it region 1 (you lucky sods).  This is a love story for any one, and any one who has ever or will ever be in love.  It's about chances, questions, and all the ""what ifs"" in the book about how love can go, and how one more kiss can set you free.  Not to mention for you Gerry fans you can get a small preview to his singing talents in one of the more uplifting moments of the film.  It does start out a little slow but the end is all worth the while.  You'll leave with the end credits rolling smiling, maybe through a couple happy tears, thinking to yourself that you have just engaged in some moral enlightenment you weren't even aware was missing.  Entertaining, dramatic, and chopped full with a few really happy moments.  What can I say this movie is life, and depicts it beautifully with all its ups and downs.  If you loved the Phantom of the Opera you will defiantly like this movie.  So don't wait until you can only get in region 2. (I was to hasty in my purchasing.)  Stupid Region Codes.  (Shakes fist.)  ggrrrr aaarrrgggg.  Enjoy!",1143244800,30,1259,4.2133891213389125
2065513,5,B00027NVXE,"I had the pleasure of watching this movie once recently; it was the UK version.  I am excited to find that I can now order a version that will play in my US DVD player!

Being a fan of Gerard Butler, it is hard to dislike the characters he plays, and in watching this film I was torn between whether I could forgive Sam as well as his old lover.  I can not write much because I do not want to ruin the film for anyone who has not seen it, but... it does make one think about how fragile love really can be.  It shines light on the idea of having a soul mate- that one person who, even after many years have passed and a life has been created with a new love, has the ability to tear apart everything a person has built with his/her lover.  This film made my heart hurt, and that, in my opinion, makes for an awesome film.  I am happy to add it to my collection.",1142726400,39,861,3.9195402298850577
2065514,5,B00027NVXE,"Sarah left her father and Scotland behind when she moved to America to pursue her career. She also left behind Sam, her first love. Now Sarah -- dying of a brain tumor -- must return home and face her biggest challenge: to die with dignity knowing you've made peace with your past. But things have never been easy for Sarah -- her father vegetates in his chair withdrawn from life, Sam is married, and the other cancer victims in Sarah's support group sometimes help her and sometimes scare her.

How do you go back and make amends before you die? Does your need to set the past right take precedence over the lives of people living in the present? This movie doesn't supply easy answers but will make you think about love, life and death.

All the actors are wonderful but I want to single out a youthful Gerard Butler as Sam. His confusion and complicated situation regarding his past with Sarah and his present with his wife is played with heart-breaking sincerity. Warning -- tears may flow...

Butler and the director Vadim Jean are planning to work together again on a movie about Scottish poet Robert Burns and I am looking forward to their reteaming on what should be another heartfelt production.",1139097600,105,1205,4.647887323943662

Ending the Movie.  Gerard Butler and the rest of the crew were very good in this movie, But I don't blame the wife for her anger towards the ex GF who after 7 yrs comes back into his life only after she finds she's dying of cancer and realizes Sam(Gerard Butler) was the only man she ever loved. To me she was selfish to stroll back into his life and not care about what it would do to his marriage.  I mean she could have asked Sam if he was interested in coming to New York with her when she was leaving, instead of just leaving and wham! or when she got settled in NY given him her address and asked him to come.

2065532,1,B00027NVXE,"Never even finished watching it! So boring I found myself thinking of what I should clean. Not even artsy, nothing good to say except Gerry is a babe, as always.",1357516800,,161,4.4
2065533,3,B00027NVXE,"""One More Kiss"" makes one wonder why sensitive, intelligent Gerard Butler gave up a promising dramatic and comic career for one of crassly commercial ass-kicking gut-busters.  Oh, that's right - if one caters to the lowest common denominator, one will make more money.  But this movie serves to remind that beneath the muscular exterior is a talented actor with a great sense of humor, and one can only hope he'll eventually be able to make the transition back to his more believable roots.

All that said, Butler, at his youthfully, physically most appealing best, is merely a backdrop to Valerie Edmond's character, who is dying of Cancer.  Unfortunately, she is so selfishly self-indulgent throughout the movie that I found it impossible to give a rat's ass whether she died or not.  She barged into former boyfriend Butler's life, destroyed his marriage, and never seemed to feel a whit of responsibility.  Whereas the viewer is supposed to love her because she's the lead character and is a tragic one to boot, instead I found myself to be impatiently awaiting her personal reckoning and reformation, to see her regret the mess she made of the life of a man who was guilty of nothing worse than timelessly loving her.

Because she plays a hand in salvaging the life of her lonely father, the viewer is supposed to exonerate her for the destructive role she plays in her ex-boyfriend's.  At the end of the movie, it's clear her father will begin a new and better life, while poor Butler will probably pine away for her for the rest of his.  Ms. Edmond's performance is excellent; but plain and simply, I didn't like her character and will not mourn her.

I believe the problem with ""One More Kiss"" lies with the script, which is too superficial for the subject.  But if you're addicted to dying person love stories, you may embrace this one; perhaps I'm too addicted to seeing characters change for the better, particularly before they part this world forever.",1354147200,4,1964,4.798219584569733

2065549,5,B00027NVXE,"A young woman who lives in NY returns to her homeland in Scotland. Her most urgent wish: to visit her father and see again her former boyfriend. She's seriously ill.

This British movie shows us how real life is. Sarah, as a character, comes naturally to Valerie Edmond. She's not a heroine. She's a human being. There's no need and time to be nice. She's suffering, she needs support from the most important people in her life.

Sam, nicely played by a younger Gerard Butler, is married and runs a restarant with his wife Charlotte. Surprised to see Sarah after so many years, as she asks him to spare some of his time to be together for old times sake, he agrees despite her wife disapproval.

Sarah's father Frank, touchingly played by James Cosmo doesn't easily show his feelings. However, we can see the love she feels for his doomed daughter. Sarah is a kind of tough girl even though there are moments she cannot stand her situation.

Watch the movie, even if you think it runs differently from other movies of the same kind you have already watched. Sarah wants everyone to go on with their lives in case she doesn't overcome her illness. Life must continue with or without her!",1235347200,,1186,4.580188679245283

2065553,5,B00027NVXE,"Any Gerry Butler fan should love this movie.  It has everything: romance, sadness, humor, and a real message.

That message is: Cancer doesn't just affect the person with the cancer; it affects everyone who cares about that person.  We own our lives and we should take charge of our lives.  In the end all we can do is follow our hearts.

Director Vadim Jean levels the sad moments with wonderful humor, delicious sights and sounds from the beginning to the end.  Such a unique opening with Sarah on top of the Empire State Building in New York and the crossing of the ocean with sounds of waves and birds calling when nearing Scotland.  The reflection of Sarah on the train window while crossing the countryside is reminiscent of movies filmed in the 40s and sets the mood.

The introduction of Sam (Gerard Butler) playing his beloved classical music with a conductor's touch, Sam meeting with Frank in his restaurant, Sam explaining his helplessness with sandcastles and typewriter keys, Frank and Sam discussing a treatment for Sarah and her funeral, and Charlotte confronting Sam in service are such precious pieces of acting.

Another delightful bit of performance is Sarah and Sam making custard to the tune of Hey Boy Hey Girl, intertwined with scenes of Charlotte dressing for the opera.  The love scenes at the Opera, and Sam and Sarah in their cottage come together in a romantic blend, ending with an empty seat at the Opera.  It tells the story in a unique and lovely way.  The heartwarming ending in New York with Frank doing what Sarah wanted him to do, take charge of his life, is appropriately set to the romantic tune of How About You.

There could be no better actors in the parts of Frank (James Cosmo) and Sam (Gerard Butler).

2065585,4,B00027NVXE,"This was a very good movie that makes a person realize how fragile, short, and precious life really is.
This is the story of Sarah (Valerie Edmond). Sarah moved from Scotland to New York to persue a business career, leaving behind her father and boyfriend. Years later, Sarah is informed that she has a brain tumor and only has a short amount of time to live. Sarah begins to think back in her life to when she was happiest and decides to return to Scotland. When she returns she reunites with her father, Frank (James Cosmo), and discovers that her childhood boyfriend, Sam (Gerard Butler), is married. Despite this fact, Sarah tells Sam's wife, Charlotte (Valerie Gogan), that she wants to spend the time she has left with her husband. This begins the journey into Sarah's final months where she plans her funeral arrangments (with excitement!), Developes a strong relationship with her father, and falls back in love with Sam.
While I understand the nature of Sarah's intentions of spending time with her childhood friend, I found her to be very selfish and inconsiderate to Charlotte and Sam. There is nothing wrong with her wanting to spend time with Sam, but when things took a turn towards adultry, she should have set boundaries. Sarah consumed Sam's time and did whatever she wanted with him without thinking of Charlotte and her feelings. She also showed lack of care for Sam by becoming so involved with him. By starting a relationship with Sam, she caused Charlotte to leave him and when Sarah dies it leaves Sam with no one.
This was a beautiful movie about life, but I found the victim in the movie to be the antagonist. I felt sorry for both Sam and Charlotte having their relationship shattered by the selfishness of a dying woman. If Sarah wanted to be with Sam so bad, she should have grabbed him up ten years ago when she has the chance. I think Sam was worth a little more than just ""The time she had left"".",1158537600,9,1927,4.6209912536443145

2065588,4,B00027NVXE,"I liked this film very much. It's a very intense little drama which will provoke reflection, indignation and much post-viewing discussion, as evidenced by the postings here. What happens when as a fairly successful young woman, you are diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour and given just months to live. What happens when as a happily married man, the first ""true love"" of your life turns up at the door and tells you she's dying and wants to spend her last days with you? What happens when as a happily married woman, your husband's first love turns up and asks to ""borrow"" your husband for the last weeks of her life? How these people respond is the story of the film and it is gripping from first to last.

The actions of these characters are far from exemplary but they are believable. These are human beings, not saints. Personally I thought the dying young woman's actions were extremely self-centered, insensitive and selfish. She must have known perfectly well that her actions would wreak havoc on her ""true love's"" marriage. One's imminent death is not a license to ruin other people's lives. The man's response to her proposition is equally disappointing. When your wife makes it crystal clear that she doesn't want you spending time with your ex-lover, irrespective of whether she's dying or not, you do not blissfully ignore her pleas because you coveniently assume you have a ""higher"" obligation to a dying friend. It may be old fashioned to point out, but a man's first loyalty should be to his spouse, not his ""first love."" The wife's reponse was to be expected. My sympathies lay with her from the start. She could and should have tried to be more understanding but how understanding can you be with someone who felt every right to take your spouse away and did not look the least bit sickly to boot. Perhaps if her husband had been more trustworthy she could have exhibited more compassion.

The script is good. The acting is equally good. This is an ensemble movie with an excellent all round cast. Gerard Butler's charm and charisma alone saves his character. I vouch that many ladies who defend the husband's actions do so because they see it as defending Gerard Butler. If a lesser actor had taken on the role, they would have been scathing in their condemnations. Valerie Edmund as the dying woman, Sarah, is just as good in winning our affections while at the same time repelling us with her behaviour. Despite my misgivings over her actions, I found her defiant attitude towards impending death heartening, even heroic. I was moved by her final exhortation, ""Don't sleepwalk through life..."" ending with its famous Dylan Thomas quotation, ""Rage, rage against the dying of the light."" Many of the poor ratings for this film come from viewers who are unhappy with the characters' actions. But judging the characters' behaviour and judging the film should be two separate things. I found the characters' conduct less than salutary but I found the film exceptionally good because it was topical, thought-provoking, involving and moving. There are far too few such films being made these days.

Curiously, the film was shot in 2.35:1 widescreen - a very wide aspect ratio usually reserved for Hollywood epics and blockbusters, not for an intimate drama like this. Perhaps the director wanted to showcase the beauty of the Borderland (Scottish Borders). With such a widescreen aspect, Hen's Tooth should have provided an anamorphic transfer (widescreen TV enhancement). Instead they have letterboxed this ultra-widescreen into the standard 4:3 frame leaving viewers with a thin sliver of a ribbon of film to watch. Playback on a newer widescreen TV is less than ideal because it has to be manually magnified resulting in loss of image detail. For a relatively recent film (1998), there is an inordinate amount of white specks appearing on the print. Not enough to mar your enjoyment but irritating nonetheless. Picture quality is as good as you can expect of a non-anamorphic picture (less detail than in an anamorphic transfer). Colours are sufficiently rich and true. Black levels are OK. The Scots accent may be a challenge to some viewers. Unfortunately no subtitles are provided. Aside from the trailer, there are no extras.",1154476800,49,4253,4.937150837988827
2065589,3,B00027NVXE,"One More Kiss has beautiful cinematography, a lovely score, an interesting premise, and a badly cast role - Sarah (Valerie Edmund).

From our first shot of her on the rooftop with arms outstretched, no matter what the cameraman and director do, they cannot make this into a woman who looks like she is sick, let alone dying.  She is too big, strong and healthy.  So I cannot feel her pain, sorrow and desparation.  In fact, I feel nothing, and that is bad for the role and the movie.

On the other hand, the actress playing the wife, Charlotte (Valerie Gogan) is perfect at showing the panic, resentment and eventual hatred of this interloper in her life.  From the very first time she sets eyes on Sarah - in her husband Sams' (Gerard Butler) embrace, even just a friendly one - she is threatened.  (As I would have been; confess would YOU come into a room and see your husband with his arms around another woman as just another day at the office?)  When Sam introduces them, he even hesitates before he says ""my wife.""  What a slap in the face.

Maybe I'm not seeing the romance in this situation.  When Sarah announces she is dying, Sam is nonplused; Charlotte sees trouble.  In the real world, right then I would have said, ""sorry to hear that and WE will help if WE can.  But that's not this movie.

So we have THE LIST for Sam it get through.  Which is just a device to be able for Sarah to manipulate Sam into kindling a romance again.  And all the singing together, skydiving and kite-flying and lush background music doesn't make it anything but what it is - seduction of another womans husband.  Leading to predictable harsh words, fights and tears.  But Charlotte loves this man; she hugs his jacket and breathes in his smell; and cries in pain.

Meanwhile, we have brave (?) Sarah planning her funeral down to what will be served at the afterparty!  I know this is to show her bravery, but I wanted to tell Sam to run out of that house - he is being manipulated.  As is her father.  Sarah may not be around much longer, but by God, everyone will remember her!  Too harsh?  Why does she show up at the restaurant just before Sam is to go meet his wife?  Didn't know about the concert?  Cummon.  His birthday! - she knew.  And she didn't care.  It was all about her - what she wanted.

And that brings us to the most emotionally satisfying scenes in the film with the most beautiful music - Charlotte in her lovely dress, hair just right, sitting and waiting, waiting, waiting for her love and he never comes.  I DO feel HER pain.

Where is Sam?  Why getting it on with his other love.  Sorry I'm underwhelmed.

The last scenes in the hospital are done well, and Gerry is at his most beautiful and touching.  He almost redeems the whole film right there.  But not quite, for me at least.

Sarah's father, played by James Cosmo, is very good and the part is to underscore the theme of the film - choices we make that alter life.

Try as I might I just cannot see that the choice to break up your marriage (even if not perfect) for a few weeks of what? bliss? great sex? is worth ruining anothers life and possible your own.  The only one who ends satisfied is the interloper who we are to feel sorry for, and I just can't do it.

And, of course, she is gone and I suppose, rests in peace.

Rated 6/10.

2065590,3,B00027NVXE,"Having decided to start a Gerald Butler shelf of DVDs, I thought this would be a good movie to share with my girl/lady friends.  Since I personally experienced a cancer scare, and having a life change because of it, I understood why Sarah (the film's heroine) looked up her old flame as her death approached.  What surprised me was the anger and condemnation towards Sarah that my friends (married and single) handed me as feedback after viewing this movie.

I liked the film, and encourage gals to buy it and have their female buddies over to view it and check out their reactions. One observation is that this is the only Gerry Butler movie I have seen where he is gently romantic but not sizzling sexy. (In other flicks he reminds this sweet old gray-haired lady of a young Paul Newman.)

 What would you do if you were happily married and adored your NICE-GUY husband and one night his terminally ill, first love knocks on the your door and wants to ""spend time"" with said hubby before she meets the grim reaper?",1153267200,7,1016,4.56043956043956
2065591,5,B00027NVXE,"This was not a big budget film but they did a great job with what they had. The plot line is thought provoking and even if you don't like the characters, you do feel for them.

There are a lot of visually arresting elements in this film. The coloring of the indoor shots evokes the proper mood. The outdoor shots are breathtaking! The use of music to advance the story was well done. I particularly like the use of 'Ave Maria' during the sky diving scene. I'd be praying too if I had just jumped out of a plane! The acting was well done all around even when a few of the lines were rather corny. Their accents are to die for! That alone would make it a must have for Anglophiles like myself. I could (and did) listen to it all day. As much as I liked this move, just seeing Sam's lip quiver when he cried made this movie worth every penny I paid for it!",1152921600,4,853,4.0773809523809526

2065593,4,B00027NVXE,"I thoroughly expected to hate this movie because of previous reviews, but the opposite was true.  I loved it.  As a fan of Gerry Butler I was once again impressed by his performance, but it's the writing and the subject matter of the film that grabbed me most.  This woman was an inspiration for any person looking to see life from a new and precious perspective.  As for those who slammed Gerry's character Sam for spending the last few weeks with a dying woman and leaving his poor suffering wife I have this to say.  If Sam's wife had any sense of compassion like Sam says in the movie, she would have been more understanding and wanted him to make this woman's last days here wonderful.  He would have loved her more for that. How can a woman be jealous of someone who's dying?  I thought she was horrible and was glad to see Sam dog her.

The end of this movie was great as well.  It really choked me up and I was thinking if something were to happen to me I would hope I would handle it with the same courage and humor that this woman did.",1151366400,4,1045,4.211055276381909
2065594,2,B00027NVXE,"I just watched this movie...and sad to say...was very dissapointed.  I didn't even find it heart wrenching...as I heard it was.  This wasn't the best role for Gerry Butler.

His acting methods are MUCH more improved nowadays.  I'm sorry....I just didn't feel sorry for this girl. I did like her father Frank in it.  Also the ending seemed chopped...one moment she's lying in the hospital bed after her surgery talking to Sam...and then she was gone????? I thought the surgery was supposed to help extend her life?  Being a huge fan of Mr. Butler...I won't be keeping this movie in my GB collection. I didn't think this was worth the money I paid for it.",1150934400,3,653,4.6347826086956525
