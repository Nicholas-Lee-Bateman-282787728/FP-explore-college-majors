4220047,4,B003Y5H5BA,"Yes, this film surprised me. It was very entertaining and funny too. I thought I would just give my usual 2 or 3 stars going into this film. But no, it's definitely not that. It's a 4! It wasn't a 5, but it was close. It just needed to be a little bit longer and have a more detailed story line. It's still a good movie though.

I liked how they made a lot of jokes and the actors didn't try to hard to make it funny. I like how there were twisted to how kids today are somewhat different than kids in the 90 let say. Example from the movie was that acting smart or being smart wasn't very cool back then. But, now it's seen as okay. Also, there was a part in the movie where Channing Tatum said he was wearing skinny jenes. Yes, today that is what the cool kids wear. ha ha But, back then, you probably just get beat up for that. Back then it was all about the baggy style jenes. The more baggy the better. I remember there was even a filing system like baggy, baggier, and baggiest! Very comfortable comparable to skinny jenes. ha ha

I would had like the film to show more of what could had been and what else that happened. I would had liked to see Channing Tatum character develop more with the chemistry teacher. Also with Joah Hill character, I'd like to know if Hill could had keep on seeing the H.S. girl after graduating. Then, there was the situation with the H.S. boy that was friends with Hill character. What happened to him after he got caught? He just goes to jail and that's it? Shouldn't he got off a bit easier? He was lower level dealer and was con into selling the stuff by the supplier. Also he was friends with Hill character too.

The movies gives off a open ended endding for the audience, where there could be a sequel or not. It works both ways and I'm find with it. Great movie. Watch it!",1333238400,8,1816,4.153409090909091
4220048,1,B003Y5H5BA,"if they had titles it anything but 21 jump street maybe I could give it a better rating. However the casting was poor as well as the writing. Jonah hill is not a lead, he was fine in small roles like Grandmas Boy, 40 yr old virgin etc... But he can not carry a film, even one as bad as this. Waste of time. Dont buy a ticket or copy of the dvd.",1332806400,5,344,3.7260273972602738
4220049,4,B003Y5H5BA,"MOVIE REVIEW #27: "" 21 Jump Street ""

Talk about a pleasant surprise. I honestly wasn't expecting much from this film, but I can see why the reviews have been generally positive. Directors Phil Lord (Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs) and Chris Miller (Again Cloudy...) to a old TV show popular with teens and gave it a modern twist..... story by it's Executive Producer and Star Jonah Hill (Moneyball, Knocked Up) and Michael Bacall (Scott Pilgram Vs. The World) and its screenplay by Bacall it basically tell of stud and a nerd and everything that comes with each working against each other to eventually being best friends.

Not taking itself too seriously it shows two police academy graduates being assigned a special undercover operation involving a high school. Jonah is partnered with Channing Tatum (Dear John, G.I. Joe, The Dilema) and they eventually realized they complement each other with their own personal special abilities.

In the process they go through hilarious scenes involving ""accidental"" use of drugs, some wonderful high school tuxedos of the eighties and a running joke involving a series of questionable bikers that have one of the biggest TWISTS at the end of the film. (Spoilers!)

Rob Riggle (The Hangover, The Other Guys) gives an over-the-top performance as a High School coach with `issues' and a phony front to students Dave France (Superbad, Fight Night) and Brie Larson (13 Going On 30, Scott Pilgram Vs. The World) who believe he is what he is.

Meanwhile Channing and Jonah are guided by a over-zealous Police Captain played by Ice Cube (Fridays, First Sunday, Barber Shop) who thinks that this is a mission only they can handle because of the youthful looks - but will fail because - even together they are not so smart.

The film has lots of comedy, action, adventure, close-calls and some very clever dialogue.....not to mention that `Spoiler' - I mentioned earlier....do you wanna know? Then read on. If not STOP HERE!

Two original series regulars make an appearance in this reinvention of an 80's TV series (that by the way, makes fun of itself by commenting that all sargents do now is try and reboot old things from the 80's) - the real' 21 Jump Street' stars of the ORIGINAL series Johnny Depp (21 Jump Street, Pirates of the Caribbean 1, 2 and 3), Richard Grieco (21 Jump Street ,Point Doom ) and Peter DeLouise (Seaquest, 21 Jump Street) have an amazingly funny came...that borders on `black comedy' because of what happens to them. I'll say no more.

21 Jump Street is a funny film with a big heart. I enjoyed this very much and I think if you want legitimate comedy with a fantastic premise...this is your movie. Yes it's another rehash - but it was fresh!",1332720000,6,2708,4.796137339055794
4220050,5,B003Y5H5BA,"Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum rule in this politically incorrect comedy that had me laughing out loud. Jonah Hill shouting at a suspect running away, ""I'm going to shoot you if you don't slow down."" They go undercover to find the drug dealers at a high school. Having been out of high school for 7 years they find it hard to adopt to 2012. Ice Cube was great as the stereotypical angry black police captain who tells people to embrace their stereotypes. Jake M. Johnson is the principle. His first words are ""I am just one more gay black kid being punched in the face from a nervous break down."" The drama teacher tells his students, ""I remember being in upstate New York doing cocaine with Willie Nelson's horse...""

The great one liners are seemingly endless. Jonah Hill tries out for the role of Peter Pan while Channing's chemistry teacher comes on to him. The guys forgot who they were and end up with each other identities. Jonah Hill is in drama and a ""track star"" while meat head Tatum is in the AP classes. The cops are bumbling in their roles but manage to get the job done. There are some social issues mentioned in the movie in a comedic fashion. One is the difference on how people view a black kid who dies from drugs as from a white kid. Another is the commercialization of education. Highly recommended comedy.

Frequent F-bombs, sexual humor, no nudity",1332633600,5,1369,4.538461538461538
4220051,4,B003Y5H5BA,"No, wait, that isn't it. There is something comendable when stupid dialogue is well-written. Few can do it but when they can, look out. I generally don't like vulgarity in my art but when it's done right, it's fantastic (see Kingpin). These two cops are more Felix and Oscar than they are Starsky and Hutch. Or Hansen and Hoffs, in this case. The whole movie is a joke, from its' premise, to being a recycled idea to obvious adults posing as teens and the screenwriters know it and keep it as running gags throughout.

Channing Tatum. I like Tatum and always have. I know I'm not getting Olivier when I watch his movies but he has a nice, easy-going charm that I find appealing. Hill, on the other hand, I've never cared for. I have yet to see Moneyball so perhaps that will be the film that turns me.

It's funny, it's vulgar, it's absurd.",1332288000,4,840,4.412903225806452
4220052,4,B003Y5H5BA,"Be real. When you first heard that Jonah Hill was planning to remake 1980s era, Stephen Cannell produced cop series, 21 Jump Street, you probably scoffed and wrote it off immediately. You wouldn't be alone, and the reaction isn't without justification. Helping to launch the career of Johnny Depp and being the highlight for others like Holly Robinson and Richard Grieco, the show was ridiculous on its face, centered on a special crime unit of youthful looking adults infiltrating colleges and high schools.  Frankly, the show was more cool than good, and neither by the final season. Fortunately, Jonah Hill and writer Michael Bacall knew there was no reason to revere the source material, deciding to go for something akin to Superbad meets Police Academy. It was a gamble, but a gamble that paid off as 21 Jump Street isn't just hilarious, it's a modern day comedy classic.

Achieving the heights of hilarity that 21 Jump Street does couldn't have been accomplished by simply bringing the same old tired idea and plopping it onto the big screen. Too many other attempted remakes have made that mistake, thinking adding a few modern wrinkles will suffice. High school is nothing like it was twenty years ago. The social dynamics are different, the students are different, and the idea of who should be popular has experienced quite a shift. Setting up the change beautifully, we are first introduced to Morton Schmidt(Hill) and Greg Jenko(Channing Tatum) in high school, where Morton is an nerd doing his best Eminem impression, while Greg is the prototypical popular jock stud.

Fast forward a few years and both are enrolling in the police training program, and both are terrible for reasons the other can compensate for.  Greg becomes the brawn, and Morton the  brains. After proving they don't have what it takes to handle the rough 'n tumble beat as bike cops, they are unceremoniously dumped into a rehashed program to use young looking cops as undercover agents in high schools. Wearing a sense of self awareness on its sleeve, the film takes a few jabs at itself for being a warmed over rehash as well, up to and including the use of Ice Cube as the token angry, African-American police captain. Cube, who has become an expert at playing off his old N.W.A. persona, is in rare form here, snarling and sneering at every opportunity. If there's a scene stealer, it's him.

When it comes to comedy, it's the little details that matter the most are often the funniest. Greg is hyped for an opportunity to go back to high school and be the popular guy again, while Morton is justifiably terrified of reliving those traumatic years. What they discover upon arrival is that the entire culture is different. Greg's bullying antics make him a loner, while Morton's brains and gentle nature earn him cred with the cool kids, which he uses to try and infiltrate their drug ring.  In a lot of ways, 21 Jump Street has smarter insights into the ways teens think than some documentaries dedicated to the subject. You know from the start that Greg is going to get drunk off his new found popularity, and while it plays out like something out of Can't Buy Me Love, it works.

Insightful thought it may be, there's plenty of room for gross out gags, penis jokes, and toilet humor. Hill is old hat at this type of thing by now, although it's unfair to say he's playing the same role here. His character is a little less self confident than usual, and not at all the miscreant he played in Superbad. Tatum, a better actor than many want to give him credit for, shows an affinity for physical comedy we haven't seen from him before. It's hilarious to watch his blank, clearly confused face as the world he thought he knew is flipped upside down. Even more so, he's a ball to watch leaping over cars and beating up rowdy teenagers. The jokes at his expense, since he clearly has the body of a thirty year old man and towers over everybody, are some the film's best. Tatum seems more than willing to roll with the punches and cut loose. For the most part, the supporting cast shines as well. Bridesmaids co-star Ellie Kemper is equal parts sweet and filthy as a teacher with a Mary Kay Leternou style obsession with Tatum. Dave Franco doesn't have much to do, but Brie Larson gives a winning performance as Molly, the girl who falls for Hill's charms.

With so much attention focused on Hill, Tatum, and Bacall, it's easy to forget that the glue holding this madcap adventure together are directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller. Their only gig up to this point was the animated Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, and you can see they brought some of the comic madness of that film into 21 Jump Street. The action sequences, of which there are plenty, are fast paced and splashed with a little bit of Looney Tunes wackiness.

You don't have to have been a fan of the show to appreciate this 21 Jump Street, but if you were then the film will feel even more special. Cameos are sprinkled throughout, including one especially brilliant appearance special for 'Jump Street' die-hards. There's practically nothing this film gets wrong. Even the closing credits rock. If there's one thing that they can do to screw this up it's making us wait too long for a sequel.",1332288000,24,5246,4.686210640608035
4220053,5,B003Y5H5BA,"I recently started watching the original series, because I absolutely loved this movie. This movie is more of a continuation of the series, and reboots the franchise. It was hilarious from beginning to end. I cannot stress enough how epicly awesome this movie is. It's filled with dirty jokes, car-chases, gun-play and action. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum play Schmidt and Jenko. Schmidt was a nerd in high school, and Jenko was a dim-witted jock. Seven years later, they meet up again at the police academy. They become partners and assigned to park patrol. When they screw up, they are  reassigned to a revived specialty division on 21 Jump Street. They must go undercover as high school students and  stop a new synthetic drug from spreading to other campuses by finding the supplier. They get stuck in tons of hilarious situations. If you want the perfect buddy-cop comedy action film, you'll definitely love 21 JUMP STREET!!!",1332201600,,931,4.961538461538462
4220054,5,B003Y5H5BA,"I've never been a fan of Channing Tatum for an assorted number of reasons. My principle reason for my disliking Channing Tatum is his lack of acting talent. His deficiencies as an actor were made apparent in every genre of film. Ever since he broke onto the scene with ""Step Up"",he has delivered his signature one-note performance in every movie in which he has been cast. And it seemed as if he would never get any better. I was ready to give up on him until I read the reviews for ""21 Jump Street"". Not only was the movie supposed to be well done, but Mr. One Note Channing Tatum was supposed to have turned in one of his best performances as well. Out of a morbid sense of curiosity, I had to see the movie for myself; and after nearly two hours of continuous guffawing, I left the theatre with a new sense of hope. Channing Tatum may have found his niche as a movie actor:he can be a funny man. Channing Tatum is......funny.

I remember watching 21 Jump Street as a youngster in the 1980's. I loved it when it was on network television.  The premise: a bunch of young looking 20 something detectives pose as high school students as they attempt to curb the criminal activity that is perpetrated by high school students. This show became a career launching pad for many of the principle characters, including the venerable and legendary Johnny Depp. However, the show has become pretty dated, and I doubt that I could watch it with the same enthusiasm now that I'm in my thirties. And when I heard that they were remaking this television show for the big screen, I nearly gagged. But after seeing the movie remake with Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, I have to say that I am so happy that I went against my instincts and saw this film.  It is the funniest movie that I have seen in a long time. I actually laughed out loud while watching this movie, and it has been a long time since I have laughed out loud during any film.

The plot of the movie is not difficult to follow. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are enemies in high school; with Channing Tatum being the popular high school jock(Jenko), while Jonah Hill is the socially awkward and geeky Eminem look-a-like(Schmidt). A few years after they graduate from high school, they enroll in the police academy. While at the academy, they discover that Schmidt is able to master the academic part of the training and Jenko is able to master the physical aspect of the police training. Jenko and Schmidt soon realize that if they are to make it past their respective exams, they are going to have to help one another. Their decision to cooperate with each other leads to a special friendship, and after graduating from the academy they are able to secure assignments in the same police unit.

Jenko and Schmidt prove to be inept as police officers in the bike unit, but they are given a second chance as undercover police officers. Their mission: infiltrate a drug operation in a high school that is run by a smarmy high school senior played by David Franco(James Franco's brother). Here the roles of Jenk and Schmidt are reversed. It is Jenko who is the social outcast while Schmidt is the cool insider. Turns out that in the year 2012 it is okay to be openly gay, carry your backpack using both straps, openly campaign for the preservation of the environment, and do well in school-which are all of the traits that Jenko used to hate about Schmidt. While they are trying to infiltrate the drug operation, Schmidt's popularity causes a rift in their friendship; and as their relationship collapses, so does their work as undercover officers. Eventually their antagonistic supervisor(played by Ice Cube!!!) has to fire them, and all hope seems to be lost for the two former friends. It does not take long for Jenko and Schmidt to become friends again; and with their friendship repaired they are able to prove their worth as officers through their special form of vigilantism.

As I've said before, Channing Tatum is really funny in this film. Jonah Hill and Ice Cube also deliver some really good liners as well. Although a remake, the film is original in its execution of the conventional screenplay. I highly recommend this film. And I have to say that if you choose to see this movie, you will be greeted with a really nice surprise near the end.",1332028800,96,4301,4.579220779220779
4220055,4,B003Y5H5BA,"I had a bad feeling going into 21 Jump Street. I never watched the original series and I'm not a fan of Channing Tatum (nobody really seems to be who isn't a woman). I also really disliked the last comedy Jonah Hill was in (The Sitter) since it just felt like a rehash of everything he did before it without offering much of anything new. With all the trailers, clips, and red band media from the movie hitting the web, it felt like I had seen the majority of the movie going into it anyway. Then there was the co-worker who went to an even earlier screening and swore on its massive hilarity. How often does that work out in a positive light? ""Some guy I sort of know said this was really funny!"" Then you go see it with high expectations and anticipation dripping from your armpits and it turns out to be about as amusing as a moldy loaf of bread. That invisible type of mold that looks fine until you sit down to eat it in a sandwich or as toast or something and then it just tastes like you're licking fresh algae off of a wet rock. Fortunately, this didn't go down quite like that.

The first thirty to forty five minutes are pretty much ruined and spoiled by the trailers. The F-word is thrown around quite a bit and random people are dry humped to bridge the gap between the clips you have seen, but things don't begin to look up and feel fresh until Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) take the HFS drug. Maybe Channing Tatum has just been type casted into the wrong genres his entire career because he was downright hysterical. His ""F--- science!"" and band practice scenes while on HFS will have you in tears. Jonah Hill delivers exactly the type of humor you've come to expect from the recent Oscar nominee and is pretty funny, but it feels like Tatum has made this huge breakthrough in comparison.

The chemistry between Hill and Tatum is also a pretty big selling point. The movie relies on the two of them to work together as a team or at least create classic moments together and it works in ways you can't even begin to imagine. Their past, their assignment, their fights with one another, and the way they both seem to get in too deep make their friendship all the more believable and extremely entertaining to watch. The scene when they're trying to make each other throw up not only shows how close they are but illustrates how hilarious they can be together.

21 Jump Street has this element of unexpected; laugh out loud hilarity buried underneath all of the clips you've seen in the trailers. While the known rule of ""the less familiar you are with everything the better"" would work in spades here, 21 Jump Street still offers quite a few surprises and really funny antics. Their take on explosions for example is brilliant. By now you probably know Johnny Depp has a cameo in the movie since he had a recurring role in the original series. The crazy part is that this is the most enjoyable live-action Johnny Depp role in years. I'd even venture to say it's his best since his performance as Sir James Matthew Barrie in Finding Neverland since it's short, sweet, vulgar, and straight to the humorous point.

21 Jump Street is one of the funniest R-rated films of the past few years and quite possibly the funniest since the original Hangover. This movie might end up with more people liking Channing Tatum or at least being able to tolerate him a bit more. Nobody could have guessed he'd tap into some comedic brilliance here. 21 Jump Street is a big-time comedy hit packed with loads of laughs to make it feel like the summer blockbuster season is already upon us.",1331942400,4,3584,4.467175572519084
4220056,5,B003Y5H5BA,"While 21 Jump Street is based on the popular '80s TV series it isn't a straight remake - rather it presents a modern day take on the concept of police officers infiltrating crime rings by going undercover within places like high schools. The film takes a much more comedic angle, while mixing some action in, and it all really works.

Two inept cops - played by Jonah Hill (who also co-wrote the script) and Channing Tatum - get reassigned to the 21 Jump Street program and are tasked with finding and bringing down the supplier of a new synthetic drug.

While they have become friends on the force in the past Jenko (Tatum) was the popular kid in high school while Schmidt (Hill) was the one who got picked on. Amusingly what represented ""popularity"" years before has changed and that throws a wrench into their expectations.

Though their friendship is never completely established or entirely credible (maybe the only gripe I would have but ultimately an unnecessary one) there is a sense that the two genuinely like each other. How they play off one another, as they go through various experiences and challenges throughout the film, is flat out fun to watch. Basing their investigation on a fictional drug makes it especially hilarious as the characters and audience go along for the ride together learning about its effects and influence on events.

Never having considered myself a fan of Channing Tatum he impressed with some great comedic timing - the movie was so good that it actually made me really like him. Meanwhile Jonah Hill brought exactly what one would expect out of him, Brie Larson was endearing as a love interest, and Ice Cube and Rob Riggle flat out stole some scenes. There are also some big payoffs in the way of cameos.

21 Jump Street did a fantastic job of playing against expectations and cliches while providing some truly hilarious moments throughout. It's the funniest film I've seen since The Hangover - not only did it deliver all the laughs but it was more clever and simply a more complete movie. There isn't much more anyone could ask for out of 21 Jump Street and hopefully it's just the start of a franchise that would actually be deserving of one.",1331078400,15,2189,4.719895287958115

4221088,5,B003Y5H5BA,"This is an *extremely* funny movie, although it has some very crude humour in it - so if you're easily offended, it is not the movie for you.  Also not idea for children - under, I'd say, the age of at least 16 - there's a (brief) scene of a naked threesome, and a lot of penis stuff.

All that said, I generally do *not* like crude humour, or nudity, in a movie, and I think this movie is hysterical.  You do not have to have watched 21 Jump Street (the series) to find this movie easy to follow, and very funny (in fact, I've never seen the series).",1449100800,,551,4.036697247706422

There are some disgusting moments, and more profanity than I've ever heard before in a film, but also lots of really fun, really hilarious stuff.  I made a legal copy of this which I edited with Corel ""Video Studio Pro"" to remove the nastiest bits and much of the profanity.  I ended up cutting only five minutes from the film (snipping tiny bits here and there and overdubbing the soundtrack from the network television broadcast, as necessary), but the result is largely curse-free and much more enjoyable.  If you don't have the patience or ability to edit ""21 Jump Street"", then I only recommend it to adults with strong stomachs.  It's a real pity they didn't make this a PG or PG-13, because it really is a very funny, well-constructed action film.",1438214400,2,814,4.664335664335664

It turns out that Jonah Hill was remaking the 21 Jump Street in the 1980s, and I would say that he did a good job.

There are also sex scenes and scenes of drug-taking featured in parts of the movie, so it's best to shy this movie away from children. Moreover, there are also scenes of violence and spewing of vulgarities that seem to be a unique part of this movie.",1424563200,,621,4.4

4222664,5,B003Y5H5BA,"Until the year 2012, I was not too big a fan of Channing Tatum. While I am a fan of the GI Joe movies, I never could quite understand what the deal was with the guy. That was until I finally saw the movie 21 Jump Street.

Our movie introduces the audience to Morton Schmidt who is still in high school. He proceeds to ask a girl to prom when Greg Jenko(who is a popular kid at the time) playfully tells Morton why the girl won't go with him to prom. No one could have predicted that seven years later,  Greg and Morton would meet each other at a police academy.

Everyone loves to have a good laugh. And when I saw 21 Jump Street for the first time, I laughed and laughed(and still do to this day) and laughed. Not too often is a movie so consistently funny and still able to be a considerably good movie but 21 Jump Street  proves just as much. I should definitely start first with the duo of Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill. They are awesome! And my dislike of Channing Tatum went out the window after seeing 21 Jump Street after the first time. He has a very likable knack for being funny, but even with that his performance was great. Jonah Hill was just as good as Schmidt alongside Channing's character Jenko. Ice Cube brings a lot of humor as Captain Dickson, and Dave Franco's character Eric is well utilized.

One other likable aspect is the even tone-or rather, the balanced feel to the movie's plot. What I mean by that is how the movie is able to be comedic but have occasional serious moments. And that is one main reason why 21 Jump Street is able to work so exceptionally well as a movie.

21 Jump Street was not a movie I expected to love as much as I do, but it amazes me to this day how much fun I have whenever I view the movie. 21 Jump Street is uproariously funny and indeed one of the better comedies I have seen which is why I rate 21 Jump Street

A Great Experience

4223084,2,B003Y5H5BA,"What I found most bothersome about ""21 Jump Street"" is that it could have been really good. The idea itself, of two recently-graduated, young-looking police undercover officers in high school trying to uncover a drug supplier, had exceptional potential as either a thriller or a comedy. Add to that an interesting character dynamic: two guys who knew and hated each other in high school, being on the opposite ends of the social spectrum, join the police force together and become best friends as they help each other using their respective strengths to help each other graduate from the police academy. Add to that a unique twist: that the definition of high school ""cool"" had changed significantly from the time they graduated. ""Cool"" was no longer the disinterested bully but rather the environmentalist with a social conscience. Add to that a mix-up that occurred through the characters' own incompetence: that the neither of the characters knew their own cover names and so each's cover identity was assumed by the other. The possibility for a comedy, which is the direction the producers took, was endless.

Schmidt and Jenko were classmates together. Jenko was cool. He was athletic, good looking, admired by girls, and a bully--which apparently was cool in their school. Schmidt was a nerd. He was slightly overweight, had a whiney voice, and was laughed at when he asked an attractive girl to the prom.

Several years later, they meet again, this time in line to register to become police officers. Given that Schmidt had no athletic ability and Jenko no academic intelligence, they needed each other to pass the tests needed to become officers and became friends, and partners. However, unlike the life of excitement they expected when joining the force, they were put on bicycle park duty where after being taunted and disregarded by a school aged boy, what they thought would be a drug bust that would propel them off park duty turned into an inept failure that landed them into the Jump Street undercover unit under the management of self-proclaimed ""angry black man"" Captain Dickson, played by Ice Cube, whose performance in my opinion was worthy of an Oscar. Dickson explained their assignment: to pose as two high school brothers and find out who is supplying the school with a new recreational drug. As their covers, Jenko, regarded as athletic but not particularly bright, was given easy classes--photography and drama--but also a bio that assured him a spot on the track team; and Schmidt, regarded as academically proficient but socially awkward, was given difficult courses such as Advanced Placement Chemistry. On their first day of school, Jenko, trying to be cool, slaps a black, gay kid to, along with Schmidt, earn a trip the principal's office, where both realize that neither could remember their cover first names and took the wrong ones, and the idiot Jenko was put in Chemistry while the athletically inept Schmidt was put on the track team.

This perfect comic setup was wasted as the movie devolved in what I found a pretty unlikeable movie. Upon thinking about why I disliked it so much, I came up with a number of reasons:

1) The Protagonists. For me to enjoy a movie, I have to somehow like the protagonist. On their first day of school, Jenko decided to strike a kid who told them he was trying to study while mocking him for caring about school, a symbol of what used to be cool. As one who is now a legal adult and a trained police officer, there should have been no reason for him to strike a student, regardless of whether he was playing a cover. It was at that point that I ceased to like the character and therefore didn't care all that much whether he was successful or no.

2) Language. I understand that a realistic portrayal of undercover police officers in a modern day high school is not going to sound like a Jane Austen novel, and I know that the correct use of an expletive can add emotion, shock, or even humor to a situation. However, there is a point at which we all begin to feel numb to it, and when that happens it says less ""hip speech"" and more ""lazy writing.""

3) Violence. I love the concept of the action/comedy. ""Rush Hour"" comes to mind, where fighting and action is mixed with glib humor. And they are funny as long as the violence isn't too real. Jackie Chan's scenes are almost cartoon-like, to the extent that watching them actually makes you laugh. Not so with ""Jump Street."" The violence was so real, that it ceased to be funny. Bullets hit, blood flowed, and men died.

4) Vomiting. I have to admit, I hate watching people vomit. I will endure it when someone is suffering and I need to help them, but I do not consider it entertainment and avoid seeing it where possible. ""Jump Street"" had two such scenes, the first of which was beyond tolerable, where the two protagonist try to make each other vomit by sticking their fingers down each other's throats.

5) Cheap gimmicks. There is a scene where one of the antagonists it shot in the groin, only to remark that his genital has been separated from his body. He proceeds to point it out lying on the street and since he was handcuffed picks it up in his mouth. I didn't need to see that.

Ultimately, there are those who will find such antics a riot. Unfortunately, I found them to ruin what could have been a really good movie.",1419724800,,5353,4.698294243070363

One of the best movies I have seen in a long time, comedy genre, that is. I liked it so much that I bought it on Amazon and couldn't wait to watch it. That is where everything changed. I couldn't believe the amount of cussing in this movie. I don't mind some here and there but there is literally a cuss word like every 20 seconds or less with the bulk being the f-words. Maybe this seemed cool when I was a teenager but now that I have a family, it sounds like a air horn going off in my ear every time they cuss. Check it out and see what you think.",1414368000,,685,3.797202797202797

With that being sad, I did not realize that cameos where made by the original stars of the Series. Johnny Depp was in this movie as an undercover DA agent. Can you find him in the film before the big reveal?

Movie was funny. I really enjoyed it. If you are a big fan I would think you would like the film, if you have never seen the film and like a good action comedy movie I highly recommend this film. I can't wait to see the next film now.

Your going to get gun fights, fist fights,yes blood too, groaner jokes and laugh out loud jokes. Great cast line up. Ever a few I did not see that coming twists.",1414195200,,713,3.9444444444444446

It was weird in that, it was pretty bad for the first 10 minutes, and then it really, really picked up. Dave Franco is hysterical, and the writing by Michael Bacall is brilliant. Channing Tatum doesn't really have a feel for drama, comedy, or anything really, but the script is so strong here that everyone in the movie is hysterical. The standout performance is probably Chris Parnell, wow, dead on! Some of the other supporting roles are really great, like Ellie Kemper. I took off a star because it was pretty vulgar, especially the ending. Also, some of the movie is not shot right, with the lighting, and some of the acting is just barely supported by the script (Tatum). However, we  need more hysterical movies like this one out there.

4224899,4,B003Y5H5BA,"Yes, you read correctly. Dont ask me why I did it. There was a convergence of factors that night! I was
surfing the web, saw some good reviewseverything else just looked like junk! I had a couple hours to
kill, and and well the time at the theater fit into my schedule.

Okay, okay, I saw 21 Jump Street! What got into me? I cant say. Maybe its because the movie starred
Jonah Hill. Wait, I don't even like Jonah Hill movies! Didnt like Superbad (2007), Cyrus (2010) was
awkward at best, and I didn't even see most of the other films hes been in. Oh right, I did like him in
Moneyball (2011). Maybe that was it! Geez, I see the guy in one film I like andboom! Im sitting in a
packed theater (opening weekend, no less!) to see to see

Please don't tell anyone I actually went to the theater to see 21 Jump Street. Please! And whatever you
do, don't tell anyone that I might have liked it! If I pan this movie then everything new in theaters this
week would have to be listed as complete (say it with my Oscar party goers) losers! So, I send you to 21
Jump Street with a few conditions: don't expect clever storytelling, check any sense of reality at the
door, don't go if you are squeamish about foul language and overall lewdness, and be prepared to laugh
(possibly out loud at times) at childish humor.

Its like Dinner for Schmucks (2010) all over again! I laughed at that movie exclusively because of mob
mentality, so see 21 Jump Street only with a good-sized audience. Their laughing will help get you
goingand ease the painful fact that you're actually in a theater watching... okay you get it.
This is one 80s television show whose re-imagining on film makes you scratch your head. What was so
good about the TV show that made it worth adapting to film? How many of you even watched the
show? I never saw one episode, and barely knew that it was arguably the break through role for Johnny
Depp. But can you make a whole movie out of it? Not a good movieno. But a fairly entertaining one
with lots of drunk scenes, things blowing up, and people getting shot. So its mind candynot bad if you
got a sweet tooth.",1407974400,,2115,4.309045226130653

And I wouldn't watch it again, because I didn't love it enough for that, thus the three stars. Definitely worth the watch at home though. Also, I had never watched the 21 Jump Street TV series when it was on. I knew about it and all the actors in it (nice to see some cameos here), but it just wasn't my thing.

4225413,1,B003Y5H5BA,"I always try to find a redeeming quality in movies I watch, but there was nothing redeeming about this.

I'm an eighteen-year-old guy by the way, and this represents every aspect of my culture that I despise. There's not a single thing I can hold onto, no character I can sympathize with from a moral standpoint. You could claim that the characters are supposed to represent the scum of society or some crap like that, but if that was the case, they failed to contrast the character to anything wholesome! It's just scum on top of scum on top of scum.

My morals aside, it's a poor comedy. The drug trip and a few other things got a chuckle out of me, but the rest is forced and painful to watch, not to mention more dependent on profanity than actual words. The writer's drew from a brilliantly extensive vocabulary, drawing from almost five whole words, including ****, ****, and my personal favorite, ****. Bravo, you're giving Tolkien a run for his money. Cussing and dicks don't make a movie mature, but childish, and a lot of movie critics would back me up on that.

Well, I suppose this movie does have one redeeming quality: it teaches us that teenage stereotypes, idiocy, and moral depravity do not constitute a good movie.",1404518400,4,1232,4.590909090909091
4225414,1,B003Y5H5BA,"I didn't even get 10 minutes into the movie before I quit watching.  After a few minutes, it became apparent that the makers of the movie had mistaken profanity for humor.  When they began talking about body parts in a way that was supposed to be funny, I knew I was done watching.  Yes, it's rated R, but that rating doesn't convert vulgarity into humor.",1404518400,2,355,4.430769230769231

Dumb and self deprecating humor.

Better than the sequel (as most ""firsts"" in the series are).

It's a comedy; it's on blu-ray.  The picture quality is good?",1404518400,,175,4.931034482758621
4225457,4,B003Y5H5BA,"This is not normally my type of movie. However, I needed something comedic and escapist and this does a good job achieving both. I doubt this could have worked with most actors attempting these roles but Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum brought a lot of talent to it and were also very good comedic foils for one another. They play undercover cops who infiltrate a high school by posing as high school students. This was based on an earlier tv show which I never saw so I cannot compare the two. This was a good, cute funny entertainment and helped really solidify these two actors' careers leading to a lot more opportunities for both of them.

4225920,4,B003Y5H5BA,"It's not that I'm hard to please when it comes to comedy movies, it's just that I rarely find anything that makes me genuinely laugh. I was talking about this with a friend not that long ago, and the only two movies I could think of from the last 10 years that made me laugh much were Shaun of the Dead and Fantastic Mr. Fox. I stayed away from 21 Jump Street when it first came out for mostly dumb reasons. One being that I never saw the original show when it aired, and the other being that I'm not a big fan of Jonah Hill given that he's already suffering from Adam Sandler/Seth Rogen syndrome- playing the same character in every movie. Leave it to free passes to the sequel, 22 Jump Street, to get me slightly interested, along with having someone leave their copy of 21 Jump Street at my home and never taking it back. Last night I put the disc in and took a chance, figuring I'd end up turning it off after 20 minutes or so.

I'm happy to say that didn't happen.

We start out with our two main characters in high school. Schmidt is a short, chubby kid who's about to ask a girl that he's known for a long time to prom. Things don't go well, as the girl becomes alarmed, asking if he's asking her to prom, and a couple of guys are watching him, laughing the whole time. One of them, Jenko, is your typical jock guy, who shortly after making fun of Schmidt, finds out from the principal that he's not going to prom because of his poor grades. Cut to a few years later where they both end up training to be police officers, and start to help each other- Schmidt helps Jenko with the knowledge, Jenko helps push Schmidt through the physical tests. They graduate, become officers, and are ready for their first job. Unfortunately, things go wrong here too. After a lengthy drug bust in a public park, Jenko forgets to read the drug user his Miranda rights, and both he and Schimdt get put on an undercover assignment instead. Their job? Find out who the source is of a new drug that's become wildly popular in high schools, and put an end to it. Things aren't what either man expects when it turns out that what's ""cool"" now is what was considered lame just a couple of years ago. Two straps while wearing your backpack? Being environmentally friendly? What is this place???

First things first, the movie is aware of its doing, and never takes itself that seriously. Several of the big jokes here come from scenes where characters point out things like how people run out of ideas and remake something old, thinking no one will notice. Another was towards the end from someone who mentions that he just wanted to be cool and for people to like him, so he puts on tons of stupid outfits hoping for the best. When you find out who it is, it's hilarious. At the same time, the movie doesn't rely on jokes like these. It had me laughing a couple of times because of how real the humor is. Hill and Tatum have excellent chemistry, and remind me of how well Pegg and Frost worked together in Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. It's just plain good writing and delivery that gets the job done here. No obnoxious sounds or over the top facial expressions, just good humor. It was great having a jock character feel like a fish out of water at a school where everyone's so mellow and doesn't seem to care about much. Usually in movies the athletic characters are written as being annoying and dumb. Here, Tatum's character does exactly what a lot of us -want- to do to people who do nothing but mope about x hurting the environment (you know what I mean, so don't get huffy over that), or getting too offended by a simple remark.

Along with the great comedy, there's plenty of action here, including some fun chase sequences. Just like the plot, the action rarely takes itself that seriously, especially when it comes to explosions. Even in the middle of some big chase that's key to helping the heroes out, Jenko will compliment a woman on how fine she looks before taking her pink VW Bug to chase drug dealing bikers. The movie gets its R rating mostly from language, drug use, and the situations going on...and there's a tiny bit of nudity, though nothing's really seen. Rarely do I mention how well a movie is edited, but here, I took note. When the party really gets started, the movie turns into a kind of music video, and it's awesome. It even continues into the closing credits.

21 Jump Street is the ultimate buddy-cop movie. Both of these guys did a great job, and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't looking forward to 22 Jump Street. The only negative thing I can say about it is that it runs a bit long at 109 minutes, though it never really gets boring. The movie moves at a fast pace, and is a hell of a ride.

Most recent remakes of 80s movies are ugly roadkills so you can't actually blame me for thinking so, alright? Remember 'The A Team'? Anyway, the laughs here come hard and fast which is just the way I like my comedy. And my women. Hah. Just a little joke there. Awkward? Okay I'll move right along. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill play two police officers who fumble more than they rumble. They are taken off the streets and sent to a high school where they are tasked with infiltrating a drug dealing gang. The humor when these two become students is priceless, with plenty of laugh-out-loud hijinks and slapstick. It helps that the two leads are charming too. The story has very little to do with the 80s TV series and the leads are never as cool here as Johnny Depp was when he did the series. In fact, Tatum and Hill are downright silly which I think probably helped the movie considerably because it is hard to top Depp's coolness in the series (back then he was the bomb. Well at least he wasn't wearing pink like Don Johnson in 'Miami Vice'!). Enjoy.",1400544000,,1180,4.368181818181818

4226231,5,B003Y5H5BA,"21 Jump Street was a gem of a comedy movie. I came into this movie expecting something great as the directors Phil and Chris have worked on some great movies in the past (and future? I saw The Lego Movie before this one) and it didn't disappoint. It was very funny but also had a heart to boot. Channing Tatum stole the whole movie. I had never seen anything this guy was in, I only knew him as the hot guy for the ladies but his prowess with the material was unmatched. Jonah Hill also pulled a great performance as well. But what really makes this comedy a gem (remember I said that?) is the chemistry between Hill and Tatum. They both worked so well together. They're friendship felt incredibly real. There's is a duo that I was emotionally invested in. For example, I really was upset when Tatum overheard Hill slamming him at the little get together just to be cool. And I was genuinely happy when they made amends before the final showdown. Yes, this subplot is nothing new, and possibly even a clich at this point but they made it work so incredibly well. You can guarantee that I was as excited as they were at the end when they finally got the Miranda Rights correct. The music and energy and jubilance of the two characters was too perfect.

That being said, there were times a little past midway through the movie where it did kind of slow down a bit but it picked right back up the farther along we went.

If for some reason you've never seen this movie then do yourself a favor a at least rent it. $4 for HD is a damn good price to pay for this movie. I'd even say buy it too. It's worth it.

4226294,5,B003Y5H5BA,"For some reason, not many people saw this movie, but for the ones that did, they seem to love it.  I personally love it and would flip it on whenever it would show up on the Starz channel.  So eventually, I ended up buying this to keep in my stash.  Great to see an actor like Channing Tatum to be able to laugh at himself instead of doing action and romantic dramas all the time.  Ice Cube is great in it and Jonah Hill back at his comedic roots.  Very entertaining movie.  Fans of the original TV show will pick up on some great things too.",1392249600,,542,4.066037735849057
4226295,5,B003Y5H5BA,Witty and hysterical writing with cameos from the original television show. I've seen it multiple times and the jokes still haven't gotten old. The execution is priceless. I feel that anyone who has been out of high school for at least a couple of years (or has a high school student) can easily related to this movie about two adults who have the chance to go back and do it again.,1391731200,,382,4.394366197183099

4226325,5,B003Y5H5BA,"This is a great film. It's raunchy, but at the same time has a sweetness to it. I credit that to directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller ( Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Clone High). They have a unique sense of humor, but also care about their characters. An added bonus is that this actually is cannon with the 21 Jump Street TV show. This film also has a high rewatchability factor. The bluray also includes decent special features, the standout being an entertaining/informative commentary track. Bring on 22 Jump Street!",1389744000,,525,4.717391304347826

4226376,2,B003Y5H5BA,I loved the old series.  Seems like that have to take all the old shows and ruin them with language.  I don't need to hear the F word every other sentence or word to get the idea of a story.  If it didn't have that it would have been a good movie.  I have 4 kids 8 and under and don't need them to hear that.,1388534400,,308,3.621212121212121

Well I am glad to see this movie didn't fall into that typical hollywood comedy.  Channing steals the film.  The role he plays is believable and funny.  I think he is a much better comedic actor than an action one.  Unfortunately, Jonah's character is not that likable and his scenes to be not that funny.  The supporting cast in this movie is great and the overall film has a nice throw back fun to it.",1388102400,,580,4.415094339622642

4226408,5,B003Y5H5BA,"One of my favorite reboots of recent memory. Typically I find Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum to be quite a chore to take in films but this comedic take on 21 Jump Street really worked well for their acting and personalities. We're able to laugh at their idiosyncrasies and annoying character traits alongside them while also experiencing a well-paced action comedy with well-written jokes and surprise cameos.

Aoki on the TV was great btw.",1387152000,,439,4.9324324324324325

Whether it's his natural chemistry with Jonah Hill, the script, the director(s), or something they had on the craft service table during the shoot, he turns in a very likable and funny performance that goofs on his hunky looks... pretty much continuously.  I don't consider this one for the time capsule (like ""Animal House"" or ""MASH""), but it's laugh-out-loud R-rated modern comedy that makes you look forward to the sequel.",1385164800,2,511,4.850574712643678

A great switch in ""who's cool"" today vs in the 80's. Only wish they had cut down the swearing as it didn't add much but makes it much less desirable for parents who have younger teens viewing. This is a PG13+ movie for sex, drugs, language. Highly entertaining to teens and mostly set in High School.",1381363200,2,443,4.349397590361446

Both lead characters transform by the end of the story, and do it in a way that represents some of the better changes that have happened in US culture recently.",1380067200,,473,4.974683544303797

4226515,5,B003Y5H5BA,"Loved it. Thought it was very funny. Usually not a big fan of remaking classic movies but they did a good job with 21 Jump Street. I know its not a strict remake but more of a sequel in that the characters are fresh and new but it will always be compared to the original. I do think the original is the better of the two but watching both provides good entertainment. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill do a great job. The two actors worked well together and really fed off each other to make a very funny movie. The supporting case was great. Rob Riggle was hilarious as usual. Dave Franco was great as well. Ice Cube was probably my favorite character, aside from ""Korean Jesus"" (you will get it once you watch it). The one lacking part of the movie I thought was the love story. Obviously you have to tone it down considering the main characters pretend to go back to high school but it felt a little forced. Ellie Kemper as the teacher swooning over Tatum's character was pretty funny. But Jonah Hill and Brie Larson did not click for me on screen.

Overall I would recommend that you go and check it out. It was worth the price tag for me at least to buy but you should at least rent it and watch it if you are not into buying.",1377648000,,1227,4.1991525423728815

4226521,5,B003Y5H5BA,"Seth Rogan is just so funny. Every movie he makes is gold. Except for ""The Green Hornet."" Jeez Louise. I had forgotten about that one, fortunately. Well, I suppose unfortunately, since I just remembered it. Now, I'll probably be unable to forget it for the rest of the day. Just thinking about him in that awful mask. Did he really think that was going to be a worthwhile endeavor? He plays a guy who is high 90 percent of the time in most of his movies. Which is great for those movies. But it was just too much of a jump for him to play the Hornet. I mean, maybe if the ""Green"" element was marijuana. Then it would have been right in his wheelhouse. Something like ""Pineapple Express."" But, you know, that's Hollywood. He's got kids to feed. Probably all over the place. I have some insiders who have told me he makes at least six child support payments each month. Not sure how that hasn't gotten as much traction in the media. Seems like perfect fodder for TMZ or Perez, as terrible as that sounds.

The Rock is also great in this movie.",1376611200,,1041,4.338461538461538

4226556,4,B003Y5H5BA,"Okay,I will be the first to admit,I did not want to see this movie. I hate remakes or movies based on Tv Show. They always screw it up. They take everything you remember from the original and destroy. Perfect example was the Miami Vice movie. I rarely watch movies based on TV shows.

When I saw the preview for this movie,I was like no way. It was like it had nothing to do with the original and in fact,was going to mock it. I have not seen the show in years but I know it was not a comedy. And this might seem lame,I hate movies with a lot of cussing. No,I am not a religious freak or anything. I just don't believe you have to say the F word 500 times to be funny. So i had no interest in this movie.

Well,the last girl I was seeing told me to give it a fair try and I might like it. So one night off from work,I saw the Starz channel had it. I don't have Starz but did have Showtime and since Showtime and Time Warner are having contract issues,I got Starz for free. So since I was off work and neeed something to watch,I would give it a try.

I will admit,I am the type that is not wrong with my first impression most of the time and not wrong often. But I was totally wrong about this movie. Yes,it has lots of foul language. But other then that,I laughed my tail off.

I honestly think it would have been better if it was not called 21 Jump Street. Cause it didn't remind me of what 21 Jump Street was. It was a serious Tv Show. Not a comedy. But it was nice to see Holly Robinson Peete and Johnny Depp and that other guy,that Dom Delouise guy's son. Sorry 21 Jump Street fans,have not seen the show in years.

That being said,I hope they make a part 2 and I am wanting to by the TV series on DVD.

So I was wrong about this movie. Just for the record,it does have lots of foul language and not a movie for children. Other then that,great movie.",1376179200,,1854,3.997297297297297
4226557,4,B003Y5H5BA,"Surprisingly funny and heartfelt, 21 Jump Street was as good as I'd heard, and way better than one would expect from a cheap remake. The script by Michael Bacall, from a story by Bacall and co-star Jonah Hill, deftly punches every passing cliche in the face. (One character's meta-monologue about the stupidity of rehashing old ideas for nostalgia's sake is particularly hilarious.) Directors Lord and Miller, of MTV's Clone High and the similarly way-better-than-you'd-expect Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, mix clear storytelling, energetic camerawork, and a sure grasp of both comedy and character beats. Hill and Tatum have great chemistry together, and Tatum in particular finally sheds the marble-mouthed stolidity of his earlier films to have some long-overdue fun. Bonus points to their costar, the awesome Brie Larson, for actually GAINING weight to look more like a real (and lovely) high schooler, instead of some plasticized Hollywood ideal. Expect to laugh long and heartily throughout, and feel glad you saw it afterward.",1376092800,3,1038,5.374233128834356

4226560,4,B003Y5H5BA,"I used to watch the TV show 21 Jump Street, and while it was clever, I didn't think it was anything special. When I heard they were making a movie, it peeked my interest, but the previews made it look like it would be God awful, in one of the worst marketing campaigns for a film I've ever seen. After hearing some good things from friends and being that it had a good cast, I decided to give the film a shot and it far exceeded my expectations. Two of the dumbest and most immature cops on the force are sent on an undercover mission to infiltrate a local High School and find out where a new designer drug is coming from. Right from the start you could tell the film would lean more to the comedic side as opposed to the show, which was more dramatic. Going the comedic way, especially with the cast they had, was the right way to go, but much of the film was still unbelievable. Anyone who believes that either Jonah Hill or Channing Tatum could even come close to passing for High School student are completely out of their minds. Also, the speed in which these two idiots went from being the worst cops on the force to celebrated heroes was ridiculous. It would have been far more enjoyable if these guys just sorta stumbled into solving the crime, rather than all of a sudden becoming great cops. As for the cast, Jonah Hill continues to be the most underrated comedic actor in Hollywood. I have yet to see this guy do a bad movie. Channing Tatum was pretty good too, he's known more for his looks than his talent, but he fit his role extremely well. It was probably written specifically for his persona, similar to his role in Magic Mike, but he still is very good. Finally, the cast is rounded out by Dave Franco, the younger and better looking brother of James Franco, who for the very first time shows that he is more than just a kid, getting work because of his brother. He was very solid and perhaps the most believable and likeable character in this film. 21 Jump Street is nothing new, it's another cop movie that blends comedy and action, like almost every other Lethal Weapon wannabe. The story isn't better than the rest, but it is funnier than most of the other films and it has some terrific cameos.",1375056000,2,2218,4.359903381642512

4226616,4,B003Y5H5BA,"Yes, I know, I am one of the old-timers who used to watch the series 20 years ago. Therefore, I was pretty interested to see how they were going to connect this movies to the precursor. The creators definitely deviated drastically from the original, but this does not mean that we got a film that is undeserving of praise. On the contrary, I found myself watching a production that had me laughing out loud and causing others in the plane to look my way to check if I was unstable.

When Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum return to high school as undercover agents, things had changed from the times when they were students. Jonah used to be the nerd and Channing the stud, but the new environment has turned things on their head. This of course provides with plenty of opportunities to create hilarious situations, and those opportunities are not wasted. The fact that the two main actors can deliver comedy at the highest level definitely helps in this regard.

Besides the fine humor, I thoroughly enjoyed Ice Cube's performance. He plays the role of supervisor of the undercover group and his over the top acting goes well with that role. But maybe one of the finest ""jokes"" in the movie has to do with the link to the old series. When Johnny Depp and Peter DeLuise made their brief, but memorable, appearance, things went from good to pretty great.

4226644,5,B003Y5H5BA,"From my site [...]

Based on the 1987 TV show that launched Johnny Depp this self aware comedy was one of the freshest movies of 2012. Channing Tatum really showing off his comedic chops and Jonah Hills own brand of comedy worked so well together that 21 Jump Street was absolutely the funniest movie of 2012.

Despite a rocky personal history Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) bond in policy academy and become fast friends. After graduating from the academy, being sub-par cops land the two in a strange undercover program that puts cops into local high schools. Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) does a great job of setting up the concept of the movie while at the same time berating Schmidt, Jenko, the plot of the movie itself, and the overall lack of creativity in recent Hollywood projects. Were reviving a canceled undercover project from the 80s and revamping it for modern times. The people behind this lack creativity and theyve run out of ideas, so what they do now is just recycle s*** from the past and hope that nobody will notice. Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) is the man in charge of running Jump Street. He was the first to admit he is the stereo-typical angry black man. Almost all of Dicksons lines are shouted, but they are also all hysterical. Dickson puts Schmidt and Jenko on the case of finding a new synthetic drug called HFS (look the acronym up yourself) after a kid at the school dies from the drug, a fact no one at the school seems to care at all about. Schmidt and Jenko find the dealer in with ease but the supplier proves to be a much harder task. Eric Molson (Dave Franco) is the environmentalist popular guy at school and the popular click takes a liking to Schmidt immediately where Jenko gets stuck with the nerdy kids because their identities get switched. The role reversal was a brilliant comedic move and the bizarre situations are knowingly over-the-top but the comedy all ramps up and actually does contribute to the plot of the movie.

Channing Tatum didn't start his film career with the best movies and only dabbled in comedies. 21 Jump Street shows that Tatum can handle more than strutting with his shirt off and second rate action movies. Only a few of Tatums gags are physical and his willingness to look stupid and put himself out there conflicts with his past film resume but sell the comedy on Jump Street so solidly. Jonah Hill comes from the complete opposite side of the industry than his co-star. Hill has been known for his comedies and most of them are quite funny. In 21 Jump Street Hill doesnt get to stretch his acting as far as Tatum appeared to but he is still very funny and his on-screen personality gets to clash nicely with the action in the movie. The supporting cast is equally as funny as the lead actors despite their somewhat limited screen time. Dave Franco (yep, the brother of the amazing James Franco) plays the popular drug dealing Eric Molson. Franco has done some very funny material. Along with smaller roles in movies he also did a great series with his older brother for Funny or Die. After 21 Jump Street he should be getting some more substantial comedic roles. The absolutely adorable Brie Larson plays the closest thing to a love interest this movie gets. Schmidt falls for her the second he arrives back at school and she fell in line properly with the popular crowd. Larson is really the only character in the movie who got to show some range of emotion. She is funny with the rest of the cast the majority of the time but she also plays the heart-broken school girl very well. Ice Cube doesnt really strain himself as an actor but the man is very funny and embraces his stereo-typical role well.

For a movie based off of an 80s TV show its safe to say expectations weren't high. Screen Writer Michael Bacall (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Manic, Project X) took a silly idea and ran with it. Admitting that the movie was goofy and having the lead actors be just as goofy as the core concept let the audience sit back and really enjoy themselves. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller don't have extensive amounts of directorial experience but they certainly did due diligence to a fantastic script.

If you haven't give 21 Jump Street a change. It is funny from the opening shot to the end. The story is told along with the jokes, it doesnt suffer from switching tracks because it can only handle one thing at a time. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill make a brilliant comedic team. 21 Jump Street is a mockery and pays homage to the serious show it was based on.",1368489600,,4554,4.569155446756426

I never saw the show, so there is no nostalgic factor here and while I'm a fan of both the actors (despite not generally thinking they are all that talented) I just am so over the whole `High School Comedy'.  This, however, from the very first scene, was a pure delight.  It just never stopped being funny, and the cleverness of the script was impressive to me; the way they contrasted what is `cool' now and then to perfect effect.  Tatum struggling to be cool in a school where jocks are demoted for their shallowness and being smart and health conscious and `tolerant' is cool was hilarious.

I blame `Glee'.

The plot is full of holes and isn't really all that interesting, but it doesn't matter much.  The concept of them stopping some new drug from escaping a singular school is rather ridiculous since it would have spread far before it was noticed by the feds.  Hill and Tatum are a perfect pair though, and they juggle their dual roles (incompetent cops and incompetent students) really well.  The supporting cast is also at the top of their game, with Ice Cube spouting profanities left and right and Dave Franco completely making the most of his unfortunate face (that's just the way he looks).

I also want to say that Jack Johnson, between this and `Safety Not Guaranteed', is like my new favorite thing about movies.

Just go and watch the film and you will rolling with laughter with teary eyes for a long long time as the movie is full of these moments....
21 jump Street is a mish mash and reboot of every cop movie that you have watched and enjoyed and raised a notch higher.
21 Jump Street echoes the series of the same name and we get Channing Tatum ( the dumb guy) and Jenko as Schmidt ( the nerd) as park officers who nab a few drug users and are then sent back to get the suppliers who happen to be high school students. Things start becoming increasingly funny when their identities are mixed up at high school and the result is excruciating pain and tears from laughter.

I just didn't find it funny, plausible, well-written or anywhere close to interesting. If you like Jonah Hill and the current strain of raunchy humor, this movie is for you.

I am all for funny, but every other word was F and all the jokes were about male genetalia. Why did these producers ruin such a memorable show of my teen years? The original show dealt with real high school issues, they may have made it light-hearted occasionally, but this movie version was vile and a slap in the face to real teen issues.

4227007,5,B003Y5H5BA,"Could not BELIEVE how much I enjoyed this action comedy, but they really got it right. An homage to the classic '80s TV series as opposed to a crass update (though yeah, the film is pretty crass), Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are PERFECT as a pair of failed cops who - as a last resort to save their jobs - are sent back to high school undercover, to break up a new drug ring supplying a fresh new high to young kids. Equal parts comedy and action, the film is awesome, even to featuring cameo appearances from most of the actors from the original show (yeah, including Depp). Funny, foul-mouthed, and a truly terrific ride.",1356998400,,625,4.396551724137931

Plot
In high school, Schmidt (Jonah Hill) was a dork and Jenko (Channing Tatum) was the popular jock. After graduation, both of them joined the police force and ended up as partners riding bicycles in the city park. Since they are young and look like high school students, they are assigned to an undercover unit to infiltrate a drug ring that is supplying high school students synthetic drugs.

In 2005, Schmidt and Jenko are high school students, one an honor roll geek, the other a cool, athletic underachiever. By 2012, they are rookie cops, paired together, on bike patrol yearning to make arrests. After a screw up, they're sent undercover back to high school to find the source of a dangerous synthetic drug. They mix up their names, and Schmidt gets the no-brainer classes where he auditions for Peter Pan and falls in love with Wendy; Jenko gets AP classes where he falls in with high-achieving dweebs. This second chance at high school gives Schmidt delusions of grandeur, which threaten the operation.",1356652800,,1196,4.7729468599033815
4227037,4,B003Y5H5BA,This movie is hilarious! I love Channing Tatum and seeing the cameos by the actors from the original TV series.,1356652800,,111,4.6
4227038,5,B003Y5H5BA,"The late-eighties TV series is rebooted with jolts of sentiment, personal discovery, and wild comedy.
21 Jump Street gets the remake job done with tongue-in-cheek style & plenty of outrageous moments.",1356652800,,200,5.483870967741935
4227039,5,B003Y5H5BA,A laugh a minuet. Never watched the orginal show. Watched this on plane trip and laughed the whole trip away.,1356652800,,109,4.5
4227040,5,B003Y5H5BA,"This movie was SO not what I was expecting. I am old enough to remember the TV show this movie was based on, so I was afraid that they were trying to do a serious take on the show, but by replacing the leads with Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill. Had they done that, this movie would have been absolutely terrible. But they didn't. What they did instead was take a more tongue in cheek approach to the remake, one where they weren't afraid to poke fun at themselves. The result is one riotous good time! Seriously!

I won't go into my favorite jokes because they might not be as funny out of context, or worse, they might ruin something for you, but if you're looking for a good time, then you should definitely check this out! It's action, it's adventure, it's fun, it's friendship, and it's worth it!",1356566400,,799,4.3624161073825505
4227041,5,B003Y5H5BA,This movie kept me laughing the entire time! Everyone should own a copy of this movie! Definitely recommend seeing it.,1356566400,,118,4.95
4227042,5,B003Y5H5BA,this movie is incredibly funny and a great movie that everybody should own.  I recommend getting one with the UltraViolet digital copy because you can redeem it online and download it to pretty much any device and multiple users can have access to the movie (like everybody in a family),1356566400,,286,4.72
4227043,4,B003Y5H5BA,"They didn't try to remake the show, they used it as a base to create a hilarious, sophomoric look at under cover cops. Don't go in expecting your usual buddy cop, comedy action either. This is pure douchebaggery in comedic form. Worth a watch.",1356566400,,243,4.545454545454546
4227044,4,B003Y5H5BA,Very funny. They did everyhig right. They didn't drag out the back story. Jokes were quick and frequent. Not stupid funny like most comedies these days.,1356566400,,152,4.884615384615385

4227057,5,B003Y5H5BA,"This was a funny movie. I like both actors in other movies and the pair make a great combo. Extra's on the blu-ray disc are ok, nothing great.  Good movie quality and good sound quality.",1356480000,,186,4.314285714285714
4227058,5,B003Y5H5BA,"I bought this movie for my adult sons. It has great humor and they both enjoyed it. I even enjoyed it, but then again I really like the two main actors in this movie.",1356393600,,166,3.911764705882353
4227059,4,B003Y5H5BA,"Pooh-pooh-ers of the Generation X persuasion may rake me over the coals, but I'll shout it from the rooftops anyway: The 2012 big screen remake of 21 JUMP STREET is better than the original. And maybe it's the low expectation... I never anticipated this movie to be this entertaining and this funny. The rumor mill indicates a sequel is in the offing. I'm so down with that.

Whereas the Fox television series was a straight-up undercover police drama with teen angst thrown in, the film lifts the original premise but then veers off into different territory. The modern-day 21 JUMP STREET tilts heavily towards raunchy comedy, with the teen angst spun for laughs. It's a clever and affectionate spoofing of 1980s nostalgia and of familiar teen movie clichs.

Seven years after high school, former pudgy nerd Schmidt and dim bulb ex-jock Jenko (Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum) are reacquainted in the police academy. Despite inhabiting opposite ends of the social spectrum, Schmidt and Jenko become pals. Something about one's reach not exceeding one's grasp, and the pair while on bike patrol ef up royally during a drug bust. They're reassigned to an undercover unit in which youthful-appearing cops pass themselves off as high school students to investigate crimes. Schmidt and Jenko are tasked with infiltrating a high school and smoking out the main supplier of a new synthetic drug. But Schmidt and Jenko take the ""smoking out"" bit too literally.

Schmidt and Jenko are in for a culture shock. Things have switched up since their time in school seven years ago. Comic books and being environmentally responsible are now cool. Suddenly Schmidt is the cool kid on the block and Jenko, the dumb loser. Jenko's response: ""Fudge you, Glee!"" (Except he didn't really say ""Fudge."")

No cow is too sacred to slay in this movie. Tropes from buddy cop cinema are exposed and poked fun at. Even Channing's age is brought up more than once, how he looks more like a 40 year old than a teenager. I love how the action scenes would play out in typically thunderous fashion but then suddenly get undermined by either the switching of camera perspectives or the sudden muting of the score. 21 JUMP STREET will have you laughing end to end. Several satisfying cameos are guaranteed to stretch that grin. Just keep in mind that there are copious moments of profanity and drug use.

Jonah Hill, who co-wrote the screenplay, and Channing Tatum are pitch perfect. Tatum, especially, is a revelation, proving here that he can do comedy. He submits one of the most hilarious deadpan performances of the past few years. 21 JUMP STREET had no right to be this funny and sweet. I don't want to neglect Ice Cube's awesome turn as the unit's sullen head honcho. Sodapop came out my nose over his line about Korean Jesus.

Also a lot of crude sexual suggestiveness. It definitely earned it's R rating. After watching previews I liked the story line of two ""bumbling"" cops being assigned to undercover duties at a high school. I anticipated a lot of chase, crash scenes (which it has) and humor (of which much was off-color). So if that's your preference in comedy, you'll love this movie.

4227159,4,B003Y5H5BA,"For many people who grew up in the '80s, ""21 Jump Street"" was the ultimate ensemble cop show.

Aimed at a younger generation, the crime drama series was part of the beginning of the FOX network, which fascinated many people for its youthful or politically incorrect television series and in the case of ""21 Jump Street"", many were fascinated by its stars.

Created by Patrick Hasburgh and Stephen J. Cannel, ""21 Jump Street"" would star young talents Johnny Depp, Holly Robinson, Peter DeLuise, Dustin Nguyen, Frederic Forrest, Steven Williams, Richard Grieco and many more. The concept of the series would be about police officers with youthful appearances and thus, would allow them to be undercover cops in high schools and colleges to investigate drug trafficking and abuse.

The series would air in 1987 through 1991 with a total of  103 episodes.  Fast forward to 2008, Columbia Pictures would have the rights to the film adaptation of the series and actors Jonah Hill (""Superbad"", ""Moneyball"", ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") and Michael Bacall (""Inglourious Basterds"", ""Grindhouse"", ""Pumpkin"") would be responsible for writing the story.  And in Hill's words, his goal was to create an ""R-rated, insane, ""Bad Boys"" meets John Hughes type movie"".

Tapped to direct the film were writing duo Phil Lord and Chris Miller (""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"", ""Clone High"" and co-executive producers of the TV sitcom ""How I Met Your Mother"").

The film would be a departure from the original TV series which was created as a drama series with a moral message.  The film adaptation would be more of an action comedy film and instead of featuring a group, it would focus on two police officers played by Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum (""The Vow"", ""Dear John"", ""Step Up"").

And the film which was budgeted at $42 million would become a success for Columbia Pictures/MGM/Original Film as it would earn over $192 million in the box office and also receive positive reviews from film critics.

VIDEO:

""21 Jump Street"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  For video quality, it appears that there was an intentional decision by cinematographer Barry Peterson (""Jumper"", ""Zoolander"", ""Starsky & Hutch"") to shoot the film with more subdued colors.  So, the creative decision to go that direction leads to a warmer, subdued, dare I say a little softer look at times.  But there are also scenes that look brighter and darker and if anything, it works for the film.  Black levels are nice and deep, details are good but the film is not vibrant as one may hope for it to be.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""21 Jump Street"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and French, Spanish, Thai, English-Audio Description Track 5.1 Dolby Digital.  As one would expect from a film with plenty of action, the lossless soundtrack for ""21 Jump Street"" is fantastic.  From gun shots, explosions, crunching metal to you name it...there is wonderful use of the surround channels and LFE.  Dialogue is crisp and clear and even the music sounds fantastic!  Overall, listeners will enjoy the immersive soundscape of those action sequences during their viewing of the film.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Chinese Mandarin (Traditional and Simplified), Indonesian/Bahasa, Korean and Thai.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Prior to ""21 Jump Street"" being released to theaters, I was dreading the film.

Why?  Because I was one of those teenagers in the '80s who loved ""21 Jump Street"" on television.  I wanted to dress like Officer Tom Hanson (Johnny Depp) and Officer Harry Truman Ioki (Dustin Nguyen) and the show was a big part of my teenage life.  When Depp sported the '70s vintage watch strap with no watch, I did the same.  When, Nguyen sported a certain hairstyle, I did the same. I would listen to the ""21 Jump Street"" soundtrack over and over and would have VHS tape of TV recordings of the series.

So, suffice to say, when you hear Jonah Hill will be writing ""21 Jump Street"", I kept asking ""Why?"".

And now, having watched ""21 Jump Street"", I have to say that I really enjoyed this hilarious film.  Yes, it deviates from the TV series that it is more comedy-driven, a lot of crude and sexual content and humor, but it works.  And instead of the ensemble cast, it becomes more of the police buddy movie that has been done before, but with even more crazy comedy and humor that overshadows similar police buddy comedy films such as ""Rush Hour"", ""Starsky & Hutch"" or ""The Other Guys"".

And of course, it's written by Jonah Hill and Michael Bacall, two men who know crude comedy that works for today's generation.  For example, in one scene, both men were forced to take the synthetic drug and in order to make themselves to vomit it out, both subject themselves to fingering each other's mouths. Or another scene where the drug reaches its height with the character of Schmidt, and during a track meet run, uses the baton and pretends it's his own penis.  There are so many crazy, gut-busting scenes that made me laugh out loud and the comedy works.  Especially one hilarious, gross out scene at the end of the film involving actor Rob Riggle, which you don't see coming.

And ""21 Jump Street"" is a film that allows Ice Cube to get back to the character with so many F-bombs, it's so crazy!

But what lends to the film's efficacy is the unknown.  Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are the unlikely police duo, similar to how Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg were in ""The Other Guys"" but not as annoying and much more funnier.  ""21 Jump Street"" taps into the opposites attract and with this unlikely bromance, Hill and Tatum played their characters wonderfully.  And considering the film has made so much money, there is no doubt that we will see a sequel.

As for the old ""21 Jump Street"" TV series, fans also get to see Johnny Depp, Peter DeLuise and Holly Robinson Peete play their original characters.  While some talents are shown on a TV screen, this small homage to the TV series also made me wonder if the character Greg Jenko (Tatum) had any relation to the short-lived ""21 Jump Street"" character Captain Richard Jenko from the TV series.

So, while the ""21 Jump Street"" film adaptation was much different from the TV series, as a fan of the original TV series, I'm glad there were major differences but also managed to interject some of the show into the film, especially showcasing the bromance between original characters Officer Tom Hanson (Depp) and Officer Doug Penhall (DeLuise) and with Schmidt and Jenko.  More or less, the passing of the baton of one era to another.

As for the Blu-ray release, while video quality was good, I wish it was more vibrant but I understand the more dimmer look of the film was possibly a creative decision.  As for the audio, the lossless soundtrack is fantastic.  And there are also many short special features included on the Blu-ray release.

Overall, ""21 Jump Street"" was a gut-busting, piss in your pants type of action comedy film.  I was dreading the film as a die-hard fan of the original TV series but by the end of the film, I enjoyed it so much that I can't wait for the sequel!  For those who want to laugh and are in the mood for a crazy, hilarious film...""21 Jump Street"" is definitely recommended!",1354147200,,8443,4.782999308914997

I thought the overall plot was well written, and funny. I don't think that the original generation would like this new movie, but I could be wrong. There is a decent amount of profanity, and I would not watch this with young children. Overall, I'm glad to have added it to my collection.",1354147200,,421,4.341772151898734

4227179,5,B003Y5H5BA,"This movie is very loosely based on the original TV series 21 Jump Street from the 80's. The movie is about two cops that get a second chance by going undercover and stopping crime in schools. We got this movie thinking it would be okay. We soon found out it was so funny. I love the two characters - they played their parts well. Also Ice Cube was really funny as well. I'm old enough to have watched 21 jump street but I never did. I'm sure they have similarities in them but not the same. I wouldn't watch this movie expecting it to be like the show in from so long ago.

Some people don't like Channing Tatum - I haven't seen him in much so I can't say for what he has done in other movies. He was great in this one. He was funny and played his part well. Jonah Hill was also great but he is good in all the movies I have seen in him.

I have seen that they are coming out with a second 21 jump street (the end also eluded to that as well). I'm quite excited and can't wait to see it.

I would recommend this movie to anyone. It really funny and you will definitely enjoy it.",1353369600,,1079,3.9631336405529956

4227203,4,B003Y5H5BA,"What's it about?

A pair of underachieving cops are sent back to a local high school to blend in and bring down a synthetic drug ring.

Is it any good?

`We're reviving a cancelled undercover project from the '80s and revamping it for modern times. The people behind this lack creativity and they've run out of ideas, so what they do now is just recycle shit from the past and hope that nobody will notice.' 21 Jump Street essentially begins with this hilarious quote from one of the characters, and is a perfect representation of what's to come, in that it doesn't take itself too seriously. Honestly, I had my doubts about the acting talents of Channing Tatum, based on previous films; but he was a fantastic pairing for Jonah Hill, who struts his comedy talents yet again. Action/ comedy films often find it difficult to balance, but this one is played to perfection. Watch it immediately!

Best bit?

The duo are forced to consume the drugs they are trying to bust, resulting in hilarity! `[expletive] you, science!'

Did you know?

Channing Tatum passed on the movie twice before he was convinced by Jonah Hill to take the role.",1351987200,,1133,4.663316582914573

4227246,3,B003Y5H5BA,"It was entertaining and funny. I would recommend it if you don't have high expectations, which hopefully you wouldn't have for this type of movie.",1350777600,,146,4.88
4227247,5,B003Y5H5BA,"Existing reviews already do a good job of pointing out the merits of this movie, but I had so much fun watching that I had to throw in my five stars. I knew Jonah Hill would deliver the laughs, but I wasn't so sure about Channing Tatum. That said, if I'd bet against Tatum I'd be paying out. He was perfect for the role and a great partner for Hill.

Between work and school, a daily commute, family and friends and a thousand other things, I don't watch too many movies in a single sitting anymore--tend to break them up into two or three viewings. And I could never get through an entire single episode of the original Jump Street, always losing interest. Not only did I finish the movie, I watched a few of my favorite scenes twice, then popped it into the player again the next day to show someone else--someone I was sure would never watch the movie--the one cameo that everyone should see at least once. (And he got the kick out of it that I thought he would.)

Glowing review aside, I do want to add that the film deserves its R rating. I had a blast, and I don't have to worry about little ears, but I realized more than once while watching that some of my best friends would have to wait for the kids to fall asleep before they could think about starting this film. It is obscenely funny in every respect, meaning a child walking in on the film at just about any moment is probably going to hear or see something--if not both--that isn't appropriate.",1350691200,,1459,4.301818181818182

4227254,3,B003Y5H5BA,"From all the hype, I was expecting a sidesplitting laugh-a-thon.  Instead, what I watched was a fairly standard spoof that veered uncontrollably from the awkward and humiliating aspects of high school to the maudlin and lame antics of supposed friends/partners.  I didn't see anything fresh or new.  There were no blinding insights.  The humor was sophomoric at best and doled out in spurts and dribbles (I will admit I chuckled a few times).  The dynamic between the two main characters was totally predictable, the outcome was no surprise, and the very special guest star was absolutely unnecessary and didn't add a thing to this movie.  Eh.

I was less than impressed and so glad I didn't buy it.  It's the next day and I've forgotten most of it already.",1349913600,,757,4.813953488372093

To me it seemed that the writers may have been going for a record of how many F-bombs they could put in a movie. The cussing was really unecessary.

I never thought I'd see that side to Tatum. He was awesome in this movie.

After screwing up a bust on park patrol, Jenko and Schmidt are sent to '21 Jump Street', where they are tasked by their hard-ass captain (Ice Cube) to go undercover, as high school students, to break a drug dealing ring operating out of a local high school, cue hijinks.

'21 Jump Street' pretty much follows the same structure you've seen in other police action-comedies like `Cop Out' or `Big Momma's House'; our lead characters are mismatched partners, given a relatively simple case, whereby they spend maybe thirty percent of the movie investigating and solving the case and filling the other seventy percent with gags. Whether you'll enjoy this film or not really boils down to if you're in the mood for close to two hours of stupid, immature and gross-out comedy, usually involving Jonah and Channing acting like teenagers. It can be a riot if you're in the right frame of mind, or a complete dud if not. As much as I enjoyed it, I wouldn't recommend purchasing this as it is better served as a rental.

You never hear about the high school ones. Well the wait is over! You can finally hear one about the hilarious story behind it in 21 Jump Street.
By now you would have probably realized this was a TV show back in 1987-1991, but the directors did a great job ""modernizing"" this film according to People Magazine and The Washington Post magazine. Directors, Phil Lord and Chris Miller are extremely good at what they do and make the entire world burst out with laughter. Together, these men created and write for the hit TV ""friends"" and the hit kids movie, ""cloudy with a chance of meatballs.""
This movie contains the story about how two high school opposites join the force and become best friends to help each other pass the police academy. They stink at being regular cops so they are appointed to a secret division called ""21 Jump Street."" Together they face hilarious situations, violent gangs, and party-loving teenagers.
This top selling box office film has been on the top for four weeks! According to rottontomates.com, 98.6 percent of people loved and laughed a lot during this movie. Fans on Fandango.com said this is a ""must-see"" movie. That's the highest rating a movie can have. In addition to all of these good words, Everyone loves this movie on yelp.com. Everyone is going to be talking about so don't you want to be able to contribute to the conversation.
The actors in this movie are brilliantly chosen because they truly look like the characters they playing, many say they were born to play these roles. These well known actors are Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum and Ice Cube. Yes, all of these actors have been in hilarious movies such as Superbad and Kick A**, . If you liked the movies Superbad, The Dictator, Borat, ted, and 17 again, you will love this movie.
This movie is very easy to find, it is in every theater, in redbox, in blockbuster, and in the top five movies on the iTunes store. This movie is also always running on the movie channels such as FX, Starz, and Cinamax. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone who likes a good comedy.
21 Jump Street is the hit movie sweeping the nation and racing up the box office charts, basically everyone loves this movie and there is a pretty good chance you'll love it too. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone who likes to laugh, enjoys comedies, and loves a good time.",1349049600,,2518,4.647982062780269
4227328,4,B003Y5H5BA,"I'm too young to have seen the original 21 Jump Street on television, but I saw the first season on DVD way back in high school.  (What can I say?  I've been a Johnny Depp fan since Edward Scissorhands.)  I was excited for the new movie, and even went to see it in theaters as a birthday present to myself.  I saw it again this Sunday, with my sister, renting it from the local Redbox.

And I still liked it!  The kids were asleep, we had fresh pumpkin brownies, and it was so nice to watch something that wasn't Spongebob Squarepants.  (Nickelodeon, why do you play the same episodes over and over again?)

21 Jump Street is a pretty straightforward action-comedy.  Janko (Channing Tatum) and Schmitt (Jonah Hill) weren't friends in high school, but they became buds in the police academy.  Janko was good at the physical stuff; Schmitt at the mental.  Now, after a failed drug bust, they're back in high school trying to stop a drug ring from spreading.

Not all of the humor is to my taste, but 21 Jump Street made me laugh a lot.  Tatum and Hill have great timing and chemistry.  In addition to pretty funny - and self-aware - dialogue, there are lots of physical gags.  Keep an eye out for the guys maneuvering around a couch in the climatic shoot-out.  Moving away from drama for comedy in the reboot was a good choice.

I'm not so big on the romantic storyline.  Schmitt ends up having a bit of a thing with Molly (Brie Larson), although it's more flirting on the phone than anything physical.  It's still a grown guy hitting on an underage girl under false pretenses.  It's skeevy.

4227330,5,B003Y5H5BA,"As I'm sure you've heard, this movie doesn't have much to do with the original 21 Jump Street. It's more of a high school action/comedy, which I think is actually a good thing. At one point they even mock the premise of rehashing another 80s show because Hollywood has no originality. Ice cube plays an angry black man while acknowledging the trope of the ABM in one of his angry rants. One of the funniest parts for me were the over-the-top setups for massive explosions which didn't go off. I understand that it is counter-intuitive that there wouldn't be huge explosions in an action movie but just watch it and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. Clearly the writers new that they were just cashing in on name recognition and managed to use that to make an action comedy that is far more fun than anything that has come out in a long time.",1349049600,,851,4.496774193548387

I must say that this movie is preatty good considering the fact that channing tatum was more likely to be a male stud than a akward fellow that is basicly trying to make a bust as a cop.

I wasn't too sure about it at first, so I gave it a bit of a watch before deciding to buy it or pass.  Now I can say this is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a good while.  Everything from the actors to the lines and the way they're delivered...  It all seemed to flow nicely.  There aren't so many laughs that you'll find it hard to have time to breathe, yet there aren't too few that leave you wondering if you're actually watching a comedy.  It sits perfectly in the middle all wrapped around a rather interesting and entertaining story.  There is an abundance of cussing, so be forewarned about that if it turns you away.  This movie sits very close to one of the few I'd recommend buying immediately.  However I do know that there will be some people out there who don't get much enjoyment from it.  Either way, you need to at least give it a chance by renting it or watching it in some way shape or form.

By not taking itself too seriously and poking fun at the very fact that it is a ""re-imagining"", it keeps younger audiences interested and laughing as well as the older crowd that actually remembers the show.  Hill and Tatum work well together comedically, I think Tatum should drop the relationship crap that he's been involved in in the past and focus more on comedies...his lunk head, entitled jock was spot on and even a sympathetic character to Hill's sarcastic witty poser.

I go to more movies than most and plenty without redeeming value and this is still the funniest movie I've seen this year.  Yes, even ahead of Ted, the Dictator, 5 Year Engagement, The Campaign, et al.",1346889600,,863,4.771812080536913
4227590,3,B003Y5H5BA,This was a comedic retake on the TV police drama 21 Jump Street that launched the careers of Johnny  Depp and Holly Robinson (Peet).  Those who were fans of the original will find little resemblance to that show beyond some cameo appearances from some of the original stars.  Jonah Hill put in his usual fine comedic performance as the nerd and Channing Tatum did an adequate job as the muscle.  I'm giving this one 3 1/2 stars.,1346889600,,428,4.51948051948052

4227613,5,B003Y5H5BA,"I really like this movie. I bought this because of some of my friends excellent reviews. I have to say i am glad i did. 21 jump street has humor, action, a plot, and good actors!

It's about two cops that used to go to school together. One kid was a ""nerd"" one kid was a ""jock"". Well, when they reunite at the police academy they realize they can help each-other. They get hired as park cops until they bust some druggies. Then they get reassigned as undercover high school students, so they can investigate the new drug trafficking fad. While undercover they accidently switch roles, so the nerd become the jock and vice versa. It's pretty funny!

Yes, it has drugs but unlike all the other comedies its not all about getting high. If you are into comedy & action, this is defiantly the movie you should see/buy. Honestly, it could be a younger generation thing... my mom fell asleep as i was enjoying every moment of it... So, if your an old geezer you might not get the humor (not saying my moms an old geezer, she just not into high school movies)But, honestly i think if your 10-35 your going to laugh an enjoy this movie! In my opinion this is a definite NEED for you Movie collection!",1345507200,,1191,4.384615384615385

The nods to the tv show have a few good bits, especially Depp's scenes and [spoiler, look away!] ridiculously Tom Cruise-flick-like demise. And there are a few chuckles, no doubt. But all in all it just felt kinda flat too often. If you liked the show, you'll get some laughs. If you like Hill, you'll like him here.

There were some hilarious one liners throughout the movie, and the chase scenes where nothing blows up were great, but other parts just seemed unrealistic or slow. I personally was not a fan of Ice Cubes over the top character and that was one of the low points of the movie for me. If you are looking for a movie to rent and waste a couple of hours with some popcorn then its worth it, but it fails to be consistent from beginning to end.

Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have great chemistry and are very funny throughout; honestly, Channing Tatum was the most surprising and it was the little things he said that got me, like the Frisbee scenes and Bakugan lines. Jonah Hill also had a couple of funny scenes. The acting was fine and it has a surprising twist towards the end for fans of the original 21 Jump Street.

But, I thought it moved to fast in the beginning, causing it to lose some of its steam towards the end. By the 15 minute mark, they were already going undercover, which leaves only 15 minutes to show the high school scenes and police academy scenes.

Overall, definitely worth the 99 rental and I am even considering a purchase in the near future. It is a great comedy film to kill time.

I cannot believe the former actors from the tv series agreed to have spots in the movie.

While nothing in the movie is even a bit tethered to reality, the chemistry and interactions among the actors works quite well within the parameters set by the movie. Often when an actor plays is a dumb character, the temptation is to play it with exaggerated mannerisms. Channing Tatum is magnificent in pulling off the character with restraint and dead pan humor that rings true. Jonah Hill also is adept in his part and is laugh out loud funny in his  audition for the school play of Peter Pan.

4227703,4,B003Y5H5BA,"I had low expectations for ""21 Jump Street"" and wondered to myself why you would make a 1980s Fox drama into a movie, as the television series was something of a stretch to begin with.  There've been so many terrible remakes/reworkings of old TV shows that I wondered why you'd bother, but ""21 Jump Street"" does take some liberties with the original and toys with the formula a bit.  It's the combination of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum that drives the movie as the two really click and do so masterfully right from the start and maintain it throughout.  The script is also hilarious with many in-jokes that poke fun at the obviously ridiculous premise of these two twenty-somethings trying to pass themselves off as high school students.  The choice of Ice Cube to play Captain Dickson was similarly brilliant as he brings a manic intensity to the role.  Hill and Tatum are transferred to Jump Street to try and infiltrate a high school drug ring and what unfolds is often hilarious and never dull, with a lively mix of humor and action.  There's no ridiculous overuse of CGI here, just Hill and Tatum going through a series of false starts, mishaps, and mistakes.  I won't give away how the movie concludes, but there's a wonderful homage to the original cast in a cameo that was a mix of gruesome and hilarious.  There wasn't a second of this movie that dragged and it was probably one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen all year.  I can only hope that the team that put this together decides to leave well enough alone as far as sequels go as you'd be hard pressed to do better than this!",1343001600,3,1597,4.536585365853658

4227710,3,B003Y5H5BA,"Back in the 80s there was a TV series that helped kick off the new network known as FOX. It starred a bunch of new actors just getting noticed and featured them as policemen who went undercover in high school to fight crime among the younger generation. Among these actors was a guy named Johnny Depp who you may have heard of. Depp eventually left and the show finally finished but has developed a cult following. Enough of one that they apparently decided a remake in feature length format was warranted. But don't go in thinking this is the same old 21 JUMP STREET.

Jonah Hill plays Schmidt, the smart, nerdy kid who wants to be liked so much so that he dies his hair blonde and cuts it to look like Eminem. Jenko (Channing Tatum) is his high school nemesis, the jock that doesn't think much and picks on the nerd. For one reason or another both find themselves unable to go to prom.

Fast forward to find both of them applying to become policemen at the academy. They become friends and each uses their strengths to help the other one graduate. Thinking they'll be hitting the streets and stopping crime they're stunned to find themselves on bicycle duty. When they see a biker gang involved in a drug deal they think that will all change. It does but not the way they hoped. Having failed to read the criminals their Miranda rights, the only way to avoid being kicked out is to work in a special outfit.

The Jump Street program is headed by tough as nails Capt. Dickson (Ice Cube). It takes youthful looking police officers and places them in high schools to fight crime. In this particular incident they're trying to find the supplier of a new drug in schools that's already resulted in one teen death. Now the two cops who didn't fare well in high school are going back.

But things aren't like they were. The things that made Jenko popular are now frowned upon by the cool kids. And the nerdy things that Schmidt did are now making him popular. It gets even more twisted up when the duo get their undercover identities mixed up and Jenko is supposed to be the smart one while Schmidt is the jock! Couple that with the fact that the kids think Jenko looks much older than his ""age"" and you can see where this is going.

What you end up with is a bit of a twist on the Odd Couple tossed in with an attempt by two twenty somethings trying to fit in. They must also find the dealers of the drugs and then follow up to see who their supplier is. Along the way they each have the chance to walk in the other's shoes from the past and with any luck will appreciate each other more after doing so.

The movie is filled with the gross out or inappropriate humor Hill is becoming known for but not to the extent that it distracts from the story or hinders it (like happened with THE SITTER). The bonding between these two characters and the chance that it will unwind makes for an interesting film as does the chance for Schmidt to finally get the chance to have a decent high school experience. Except that he isn't a student and almost falls into the trap of getting too involved in his undercover identity.

There are plenty of laughs and a few decent action sequences. My favorite laugh involved a chase scene where things that would normally explode in any other movie don't. In addition to the story laced with humor we get some decent cameos by members of the original series including Holly Peete Robinson, Peter DeLuise and Depp himself (though you'll never recognize him until he wants you to). It's not a bad movie and one I can actually see myself watching again down the line. Entertaining and light fare, this is a movie that will give you just what you expect.",1342569600,9,3675,4.419497784342688

Aside from my reservations about a remake (although, you could argue against this being technically a remake and more of a reboot), I was concerned that this movie seemed to focus on two characters instead of the ensemble that I remember from the TV show. I was also maybe a little concerned that this was more of a comedy, which is not really how the original was done.

The movie gets through its exposition pretty quickly and, at the same time, makes a couple of comedic nods to its own unoriginality and the general unbelievability of the premise. After that, all of this sinks into the background and you're allowed to have a pretty enjoyable movie experience. This isn't the Jump Street of 25 years ago, but that would look pretty stupid today. The original premise was a fun one and if you just translate that into the present day, this is kind of what you get. It was a really fun movie.",1342224000,,961,4.4602272727272725

4227725,3,B003Y5H5BA,"It's summer so it must be time to rehash an old TV series and bring it up to date.  This time the producers take a popular show from the mid '80's that was a launching pad for Johnny Depp, who played a cop who goes undercover at a high school.  I never watched the show but it is my understanding it was played as a straight-ahead police drama but with teens in lead roles.  Smart for ratings.

This time, while the overall plot is the same, it's played for laughs.  And it partially succeeds.  We're used to seeing Jonah Hill in comedic roles and he's always good.  Hunky co-star Channing Tatum has pretty much been in dance oriented flicks, dramas or action films so this is a step up (pun intended) in a new direction.  The two rookie cops were high school classmates 7 years earlier.  Jenko (Tatum) was a stud, but dumb.  Schmidt (Hill) was a geek and very smart.  In their new assignments, the principal gets their aliases confused (our cops also can't seem to remember what their undercover names are) and so they get the wrong schedule.  Oh yeah.  They're supposed to be brothers.

With only 30 days left in the school year you would think these two could assimilate into the school and catch the drug dealers.  But even the supposedly smart one (Schmidt) manages to get in over his head.  I realize that each character is to have a second chance at finishing high school the right way, but really?  The film ends tidily and there are enough good laughs to give the film a modest recommendation.

The Blu ray disc is just fine if not very colorful or explosive.  It has a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  The audio is excellent in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is very immersive.  A shoot out at the end of the film will get you dodging bullets from all angles.",1342137600,,1755,4.404984423676012

There are a couple - maybe 4-5 cheap, kneejerk laughs sprinkled throughout, but the rest of the story is so unplausible, beyond ridiculous, heavy handed, bogged down, and uncreative as to wonder why the producers couldn't have nixed this one before it got out of the gate. It belongs in a septic tank or sewer. It is THAT bad. Blu ray looks and sounds great,...just wish the movie did too. P.S. I love both actors especially Jona. I like Ice Cube,...but I did not like this movie. The 3 people that also had 1.3 hrs of their life irrevocably taken with nothing in return also didn't ahem - ""like"" the movie.

This movie is moderately crude and has a lot of curse words flying around. It feels very real, which is the vibe that comes across. All the modern day trends are pointed out in a really funny way, showing the way high school is today. It was brilliant the way they took two guys who haven't been out of high school too long, but long enough to not understand what has happened with the cliques they grew up with. This is not an exact remake of the original and I feel that those who absolutely hated it do not realize this.

4227734,4,B003Y5H5BA,"""21 Jump Street"" shares little in common with the 80's TV series of the same name that helped launch both Johnny Depp's career and the Fox network. Although the film's two main characters Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) both enter into the same undercover police program that has its officers posing as high school students, ""21 Jump Street"" the film is really a raunch-with-a-heart-of-gold romp from the Judd Apatow school of moviemaking, with a little bit of classic ""Lethal Weapon"" style action-comedy-calamity thrown in for good measure.

Surprise! The film actually works, and manages to be funny, entertaining and endearing throughout. Much of this has to do with the chemistry of the film's leads. Hill's Schmidt is book smart, but awkward, and Jenko is brawny but oafish. The two originally meet in high school, with Jenko's popular kid bullying Schmidt's nerd, but when they meet again years later in the police academy, they find that their differences actually make for a great friendship.

When the two return to high school in the Jump Street program to infiltrate a drug ring, they realize that much has changed over the years. The ""cool kids"" are now politically correct, sensitive, and eco-conscious, and they surprisingly accept sensitive Schmidt and reject apathetic Jenko. Jenko instead finds his niche with the science nerds, finding their mastery of technology appealing. In this way, the film makes a skin-deep commentary about how subjective and fleeting things like popularity and acceptance can be.

But mostly the whole thing is just played up for lots of laughs, with Hill and Tatum showing that they're up for just about anything; including singing showtunes, dressing up like Peter Pan, reciting poems about chemistry, and, in the film's funniest sequence, getting stoned out of their minds on an illegal designer drug while at school. Two supporting actors also shine in the film, Brie Larson (""United States of Tara"") as the popular theatre aficionado who Schmidt falls for, and David Franco as the film's politically correct high school drug kingpin. Johnny Depp also makes a brief but pivotal and hilarious cameo in the film's manic climax.",1341792000,2,2189,5.16056338028169

To be honest though, it's not bad, delivering some fairly solid laughs amid some really ludicrous setups and pretty much everything you see in Act One is a setup for a punch line in the finale.

As usual, all the high schools kids look way too old to be in high school which gets around the potential creepiness of these guys going on prom dates with teenagers. And if vulgarity turns you off, this may not be the movie for you since it's on par with The Hangover for the inevitable stream of juvenile sex jokes.

4227757,5,B003Y5H5BA,"The idea of seeing a movie version of 21 JUMP STREET didn't catch my interest but I was surprised at how many of my friends said it was funny and good.
The odd thing is the film is raunchy yet good-natured and above all, funny. There is a twist to the narc cops go back to high school as students story. Schmidt (Jonah Hill) was the studious, nerdy guy in high school. His nemisis Jenko (Channing Tatum) was the good looking, not so bright jock type. Years later, they end up fairly useless police officers send undercover to expose a high school drug ring.
Though it hasnn't been that many years since high school for Schmidt and Jenko, the rules have changed. Today's high school kids are socially conscious vegetarians worried about the mileage their cars get. Brainless jocks are out. Nerdy intelligent guys are now popular. The rules have changed except for one thing. Someone is suppling the high school kids with a new ""feel good"" drug that quickly turns bad and potentially fatal.
Although the dialogue can get rather ""colorful"" and there are a lot of references to the male ""organ,"" 21 JUMP STREET is actually a coming of age story between two opposites who learn to love and respect each other. Despite the raunchy humor and drug use, there is a gentle nature to the story. Hill and Tatum work together well and there is a genuine friendly chemistry between them. One of the funniest scenes is when the two have to take the drug to prove they are not cops and the hallucinations are hilarious. Don't miss the small but very noticeable cameos by an original 21 JUMP STREET TV star and current top movie star.
We all need a funny movie at times and for once this is not a mindless rauchy comedy. There is a message and a story. It's clear why Jonah Hill was nominated for an Academy Award for another role last year. This guy is going places.",1341187200,,1850,4.508928571428571

4227761,4,B003Y5H5BA,"I'm going to be totally honest. When I first heard about the movie, I mentally groaned. Why does Hollywood want to remake everything? And out of everything that can be remade they picked 21 Jump Street? :S. However I watched the trailer when it came out more out of morbid curiosity than anything else and was surprised at how funny it looked. My best friend also expressed interest so off we went to the theater.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was funny and a bit over the top but it worked. And while Channing Tatum isn't the best actor on the planet, his awkward and somewhat stiff acting style worked for this particular movie because that's exactly as you would imagine the character to act. I thought the idea that high school had changed so much from when the two leads had gone was kind of funny though not necessarily true but it worked for the film.

I generally prefer to own blu-rays with itunes digital copies and have quite an extensive collection but I instead went directly to Itunes on this particular movie because of the ultraviolet digital copy. Ultraviolet lets you stream the movie for a year before, at the retailer's discretion, they may start charging you streaming fees. It actually says that in the UV website's fine print under the 'Streaming' section. It's just another way for the consumer to re-buy what they've already bought.

I can't take more than a few minutes of this total piece of garbage before I just have to shut it off - I wish I could give it 0 stars (or less).
1. The two main actors are NOT funny (actually, they're irritating).
2. If you watch the trailer, it appears you've already seen all the humorous parts in this film?
3. Someone apparently decided stringing together long / numerous obscenities, childish sexual references, and unfunny slapstick passes as humor - I (along with a lot of other reviewers) do not.
4. Even though it's obviously not for adults, since young kids shouldn't watch it based on point 3 above, exactly who is this film's target audience?

At this point, it's only 33 minutes of my life I'll never get back - I keep telling myself to give it a few more minutes, but at this point I don't know if I can stomach any more.

4227765,4,B003Y5H5BA,"A pleasant surprise with plenty of laughs and a good performance by Ice Cube to boot.

This film never took itself seriously and kept the action flowing. Not the stuff of legend, just a movie that served up funny scene after funny scene and was first-class entertainment.

Jonah Hill is a recognized and extremely competent comedic actor but Channing Tatum - who knew? I guess he did because he is first-rate funny throughout.

Ice Cube's take on the classic cranky chief from 70's and 80's flicks was great - over the top, but still in control. Rob Riggle follows up his performance in ""The Other Guys"" with another great role as the arrogant jerk whom makes you laugh until you want to beat the junk out of him.

The film fell a little bit short in some of the details and some of the other supporting characters are two-dimensional but those issues are small potatoes within the feast of yuks you get along the way.

**SPOILER ALERT**

The non-explosions during the car chase are small bits of genius and setup the big bang that comes up later perfectly.

4227769,5,B003Y5H5BA,"NOTE: I did NOT watch the original TV series, and was not even born yet. However, I'm not so dumb as to miss references to the original and since I did not watch the show (whether that means it was a good thing or a bad thing), they were still funny to me.

It's a great movie, though. Jonah Hill is always funny. Channing Tatum not so much. However, in this movie he really steps up for once and you can see he's a pretty good actor. Newly found respect for the guy. Maybe he's got a limit on his emotions, but it all fits with his character here and it's not his usual performance. After seeing this, I could imagine he would be a pretty good fit in some other comedies down the road.

As far as plotline, it shares little with the original. If you watch it, you'll see it's more of a modern sequel to the original rather than a remake, so don't be upset that they're just taking the title from it. Which, essentially they are, but it's not frustrating. The story itself is not too incredible, but it's not what makes the movie. It's the way things happen, how people say things, and the characters who progress this story so well. The one-liners are some of the best I've ever seen, very much like Pineapple Express- a great one-liner movie.

Another thing about this movie is it's just not a story with characters, but it's basically a parody of, well, society these days. Specifically high school. Between the cool kids being eco-obsessed, studying, tolerant, yet popular shows how kids these days have changed. It mocks the ""good-old days"" when cool kids gave wedgies and laughed at losers. With the two main characters seeing the changes first-hand, you can really understand them and the school they go to. Secondly, it mocks cliches in a big way. I won't spoil things, but it puts jokes on car chases, lack of originality in movies, and especially the angry, black police captain. Again, it's not a cliche in the movie, but rather it knows damn well what it's doing and offers a straight-up parody of it.

I hear few complaints about it, especially how someone I know (who thinks he's a professional movie critic, by the way) explain how it's just ""depending on laughs by sticking in the f word between a sentence."" Sure, it has some of that. But not in a distracting manner. In fact, I'd say some of the funniest lines are things you don't even notice the first time, like a line in the background or a reference to something earlier in the movie you may have missed. It's written well, and may take more than one viewing to fully understand.

Give it a chance. You'll like it. If you don't have an open mind and are not looking for fun or are angry about how it gives 21 Jump Street a bad name, you won't enjoy it. But put it aside for 2 hours and just enjoy the movie for what it is. It's great.",1340928000,,2807,4.380038387715931

4227776,4,B003Y5H5BA,"Surprisingly, this movie was hilarious. The previews looked really lame, but it succeeds in being funny, clever, self-deprecating.

The tipoff is when Ice Cube tells the two officers they're ""reviving an old program from the 80's"" because the powers-that-be can't think of anything original.

The first funny theme is their expectations of what's ""cool"" in school is somewhat outdated since the days they were in school. Today it's all about eco-sensitivity instead of beating up classmates. The second is when things get really messed up when they forget their identities and thereafter have to reverse roles (track star jock vs. geek).

There is a love interest or two, complications arising from the initial drug bust and a run-in with a chatty family friend, and subplots involving Peter Pan and nerdiness.

So it's really funny, and actually kind of sweet as well, as the two get to gel more as the plot progresses.

Be warned, there is constant vulgarity, especially regarding sex acts; there is a brief depiction of a high school student three-way; and slight vomiting. Oh, and someone gets his, ah, junk shot off, and has to grab it with his mouth.

The spoofs of action and chase films were nicely scripted e.g. which trucks are going to catch fire or explode and is turns out it's the truck with the chickens; the apartment drug exchange shoot out with the customary unlimited ammo. Acting was pretty much just act stupid and read your line with exception of Ice Cube who gave his character a bit of personality. A favorite foil for Hollywood script writers are school personnel and they didn't hold back for this fictitious school and to their credit created a couple of interesting portrayals but also had the usual stereotypes.

It kind of disturbed me that the main characters actually end up taking drugs to appease the drug dealer in the movie and end up tripping something fierce and then they throw a party serving alcohol and drugs to minors.  Through the whole movie, I was thinking...yeah, right these guys are supposed to be cops!  These guys are supposed to be solving a crime and they are getting involved in the crime? It would have been more inventive if the writer of the script found ways for the characters to get out of the situations.

2) Deleted Scenes
3) Gag reel
4) Cube-o-Rama - Ice Cube's outtakes

4227796,4,B003Y5H5BA,"In high school, Schmidt and Jenko were polar opposites: the nerd and the jock, natural rivals.  Fast forward a few years, and they become fast friends while going through police academy.  The only problem is, they're lousy cops.  But they're young looking, which makes them perfect candidates for the departmental revival of an 80's undercover program, headquartered at 21 Jump Street.  Their job: infiltrate a local high school, disguised as students, and stop a drug smuggling operation.  However, they both find that high school is not what it used to be.  Hijinks ensue.

Surprisingly, 21 JUMP STREET is funny.  In spots, it's absolutely hilarious.  It slowly comes apart in its third act (one particular gag goes a little too far, though it's funny at first), but the first two-thirds are genuinely amusing and occasionally thoughtful.  As Schmidt, Jonah Hill tones down his usual schtick (and his body mass); as Jenko, Channing Tatum is actually hilarious (who knew he could act?!).  The actors' chemistry is undeniable (they're real-life buddies), and helps carry the film.  The supporting cast is equally strong: Dave Franco, Brie Larson, Robb Riggle, and Ice Cube stand out.  And a pair of hilarious cameos helps cap things off.

As good as the acting talent is, the real star here is the script.  There's obviously a lot of imrpov, but the script manages to flip high school cliches on their head.  Part of the fun of the film is watching Schmidt and Jenko react to this new high school world; throw in a few high-octane scenes perfectly parodying action films, and you come up with a film that may not be brilliant, but it's at least pretty smart.  If you like hard-R comedies that have some brains behind them, 21 JUMP STREET is right up your dark alley.",1340582400,,1766,4.852842809364549

A shame really, because I do think the premise was promising as a farcical comedy and it had it's moments.

The story opens with Jenko (Tatum), a jock, and Schmidt (Hill), a nerd, in high school where they don't get along.  They come together as they go through the police academy to share their strengths.  Unfortunately, they suck at being bike cops and get reassigned as undercover cops who will go back to high school to expose a drug ring.  Jenko again screws up and gets their cover identity backwards once in the school.  This might have been a problem, but it turns out that things are much different in high school a decade later.  What was once cool is now verboten and being a tree-hugging hipster is mucho cool.

This movie was a riot.  Jonah Hill is always excellent at physical humor but Channing Tatum is able to hold his own.  When they take the new designer drug and proceed to freak out, I laughed so hard I almost cried.  The physical humor is also balanced with some witty dialogue and sarcastic humor.  Add in Ice T and David Franco (James Franco's adorable younger brother) and you have a great cast you connect with.

This movie will keep you satisfied whether or not you saw the TV show.  It gives an appropriate nod toward the show without relying too heavily on inside jokes or old storyline.  I truly enjoyed having a good laugh.",1339372800,,1491,4.383211678832117

4227807,5,B003Y5H5BA,"Okay, first things first.  I LOVE the 21 Jump Street series.  At first when I heard it was announced, I thought to myself, 'A comedy?  And the cast includes Channing Tatum and Rob Riggle?  THIS MUST BE STOPPED!'.  And so I was against it for months.
Then, the first trailer came out.  Had some funny-looking scenes, but what really got me was the red-band trailer.  I guess it's an acquired taste, but I love the vulgar humor style of Jonah Hill, and I was cracking up at the trailer.  At that point I went from being totally  against the movie to counting down the days til it came out.
When the good reviews came rolling in, I got a bit worried.  Only because, I usually hate movies that everyone says ""Oh, it's so great, you must see it!"".  Case in point: Anchorman, Avatar, the Hangover.  All got rave reviews, and I hated them all.
But opening day came, and when I left the theater afterward, I was not disappointed.  Actually, I was sure it was the most fun I'd had at the movies since I can't remember when.  The laughs started early and never let up.  And though the main focus is comedy, the action scenes don't disappoint, though it never stops making you laugh.  And, surprisingly, Channing Tatum was actually really funny.  At one point you even start to feel bad for his character -  something I never thought I would find myself saying.  I loved it so much that I went back and saw it three times in theaters.

Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum take their roles about as seriously as the film does itself (read: not at all) but still manage to develop a weird sort of chemistry as a helplessly stupid, modernized odd couple. It's to be expected that they'll stumble and bumble their way to the head of a major criminal organization. But rather than trying in vain to avoid the cliches inherent with such a familiar premise, Jump Street completely embraces them and actually dictates its decision to do so. Maybe the best example of this is in Nick Offerman's all-too-brief cameo, as he stares down the lens and deadpans a monologue about recycling thin gimmicks from the past. For storyline purposes, he's talking about the department resuscitating the Jump Street undercover program, but it doesn't take a grin or a wink to know what he's really on about. He grins and winks anyway. As a parody of everything from its genre to its audience, this is pointedly effective stuff.

I'm a fan of Channing Tatum, and he is usually very good in whatever role he is in, but he could only do so much with this script.

The humor would only appeal to people who love raunchy jokes that take no creativity or imagination.  There must have been at least a hundred references to a certain part of the male anatomy throughout the film, and I'm being conservative there.

These guys are supposed to go back to high school as undercover narcs, and you you would think that would be cool and funny, but this is like dumber and dumbest in high school, minus the laughs. Anyway, I believe the joke is on you if you watch this movie, but go see it if you don't believe me.

4227815,3,B003Y5H5BA,"There is a moment in 21 Jump Street when Tatum and Hill's adult cops posing as kids arrive at the high school for the first time where you know things are shortly going to go very, very bad for them.  The surprise isn't that it goes bad but how it goes bad: Tatum's character, ""Jenko"", is the typical dumb cool kid jock who seemingly had everything that all the nerds wanted in HS while Hill's character, ""Schmidt"", was the smart fat loser kid.  As the two get out of their car and re-enter the world of HS almost 7 years afterward, posing as brothers, Jenko rides Schmidt for wearing his backpack using both straps instead of just one slung over the side a la the cool kids.  ""I don't want to be seen with you, man, you don't wear your bag like that!""  But as they walk along the camera shows you all of the cool kids, the jocks and preppies and rich kids and clubbers, are all wearing their backpacks with both straps on.  Jenko, bewildered, scratches his head, ""What is this, man?""  As they walk past more groups that aren't cool (the goths, the stoners, and even a small chirp of Japanese girls dressed in cosplay whom Jenko acknowledges, ""I don't even know what they are!"") Jenko drops his jaw as they are all single-slinging it.  Schmidt, with a big grin, is avenged.  As with much of this movie everything for the partners is turned inside-out, upside down.

It is moments like this that make this film an enjoyable comedy.  It is the updated, fish-out-of-water notions that are well and wisely played here that offer up the biggest laughs.  The preoccupation with jokes concerning male genitalia and some of the more routine odd-couple buddy cop comedies are nicely played if nothing new.  The cameos of our heroes from the original television series (but where was Aoki? and Fuller?) are fun and even surprising (DeLuise is almost unrecognizable and I completely missed Richard Grieco) and will only add to the enjoyment of those of us who remember the original series with some fondness.

  Morton Schmidt (played by Jonah Hill) had dyed-blonde hair and braces in the twelfth grade so, naturally, when he attempted to ask out his high school crush, he choked and was shot down anyway. While this was devastating to him, Greg Jenko (played by Channing Tatum) found it hysterical and made no effort to hide it. The shoe was eventually on the other foot, however, when the principal revealed that Jenko (Tatum) would not be allowed to graduate. Years later, in the police academy, Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko meet again, they decide to help each other overcome their respective shortcomings and, in so doing, graduate. But a screw-up results in their first arrest being invalidated and, as punishment, they're reassigned to a program that was discontinued in the 80's and brought back because ""the guys upstairs ran out of ideas years ago"". Their new headquarters: 21 Jump Street. Under the direction of their captain (Ice Cube), they're sent undercover as high school students to find the supplier of a new drug that recently caused the death of a white high school student after he'd posted a video of himself under the influence of said drug and posted it on YouTube.

  The inside jokes about the basis for this movie being a television program from the 80's and cameo appearances from two former cast members are hilarious. Also entertaining is the sharp contrast in youth culture between today and ten years ago. Hill is basically playing a role he's played several times before, ditto for Tatum, and Ice Cube, playing a role that even the cast admits is clich, is fantastic.

So they're not trying to be the tv show.

Consequently, they are assigned to an angry sergeant who is stuck in a Korean Church (at 21 Jump Street) and sent undercover to a local high school to find the distributor of a lethal drug that is making its way into the teenage culture. Unfortunately, this means they have to live at home again.

Part of the joke is that former jock Tatum is mistakenly assigned to the brainy classes, while poor pudgy Hill is sent to the track team. Another joke is several setups for blowie uppie stuff that simply do NOT explode. Our heroes are confused because they were counting on explosions. Of course the party when the parents leave town is predictably lewd and destructive. Even Mom's Kokopelli jug from Sedona bit the dust!

These guys gave it their all:
  * Channing Tatum (""The Vow""), demonstrating hitherto unknown comedy chops. Who knew? (He's the jock.)
  * Jonah Hill (""Moneyball""), more slender now than he has ever been, his character has a real problem shooting a gun. (He's NOT the jock.)
  * Ice Cube (""Rampart""), is the astonishingly profane (and furious) sergeant.
  * Dave Franco (""Fright Night""), is a politically correct environmentalist who is scared to death of going to prison. (""Do you know how they treat handsome guys like me in there?!"")

Even thought this wasn't my cup of tea, I tip my hat to the folks that targeted their audience and scored a bullseye! Amazon.com will tell me when it's available on DVD.",1333843200,4,1915,4.858461538461539

Despite all the hype, I'm sad to report that 21 Jump Street, the new action comedy based on the 1987 TV series, just isn't very funny. My problem with it, is that Jonah Hill's 'Morton Schmidt' and Channing Tatum's 'Greg Jenko' are so over the top as cops, that you cannot take most of it very seriously at all.

For example, when Jenko can't remember his Miranda warnings, or even worse, when Jenko fires his gun in the park, after tackling a bad guy, these type of things would probably lead to immediate dismissal from the force in real life. And what about, after being expressly prohibited from serving alcohol to minors, the bumbling duo go ahead and serve up drinks at the 'undercover' party, anyway?; not to mention the confiscated marijuana they take from the police property room place, without authorization.

The joke is supposed to be that in reality Schmidt and Jenko are really glorified fraternity members, who just happen to have jobs as police officers. Where I could definitely buy a bunch of 'loose cannon' fraternity members in a film like 'Animal House', where one demented group is pitted against a 'straight' one, it doesn't really work in the police setting, since as stated above, improprieties are simply not tolerated.

While a good deal of the humor of '21 Jump Street' is juvenile in nature, on one occasion it veers into the area of being quite vile. This is near film's end when the bad guy is castrated and somehow, we're ask to laugh when viewing the scene of his detached member. No it's not funny and I hope word gets around that this is the kind of gross 'humor', Hill and his fellow scenarists are trying to peddle.

No need to recount all the details of the plot. Suffice it to say, that Schmidt and Jenko are on a mission to take down assorted bad guys who have been selling a new 'designer drug' in the school. It's your typical buddy movie where Schmidt is the nerd with a brain who can help the intellectually challenged Jenko, and Jenko is the jock with a powerhouse punch who can bring the socially inept Schmidt, out of his shell.

Actually, it's the bad guys, who really keep the story moving along. There's 'Eric', the eco-friendly big man on campus who moonlights as a drug dealer, and his supplier, Mr. Walters, a physical education teacher, whose goofy demeanor masks a huge anger management problem. To top it off, an assorted bunch of nasties, consisting of bikers and gang members, led by the menacing 'Domingo', lend an air of verisimilitude, not found in the antics of the principals, Jenko and Schmidt.

Occasionally, there are a few amusing bits in '21 Jump' including trucks filled with gasoline that fail to explode as well as some funny hallucinations which we get to see, when the protagonists are forced to take drugs in order not to blow their cover. But on the whole, Jonah Hill and co-writer Michael Bacall's frat-boy humor, lacks subtlety and relies on low-level slapstick routines, to get by. At this point, America is so desperate for something humorous in the movies these days, that a mediocre exercise such as this, is hailed as a comic masterpiece!",1333497600,3,3162,4.696750902527076
4227824,4,B003Y5H5BA,"""21 Jump Street"" is only loosely based on the original television show that starred mega star Johnny Depp. The only real reason for comparison is the premise of police officers given orders to return to high school and pose as teenagers. They are instructed to infiltrate and bring down a synthetic drug manufacturing and distribution ring. Jonah Hill (Moneyball) plays Schmidt, a former high school nerd and current police officer newbie with skills of the brain, but no physical skills. Channing Tatum (The Vow) plays Jenko, who is just the opposite. Together, they are a perfect fit and a disaster waiting to happen.

""21 Jump Street"" is a lot of fun and always entertaining. The movie introduces you to the characters and their personalities. You know them and you relate to them. The story is even fairly intriguing, which isn't always the case in movies like these. As Schmidt finds himself getting over all the things that plagued him in high school, you find yourself rooting for him.

There are constant jokes and laughs throughout the movie. Although, I did notice that many of the best laughs were spoiled by previously released promotional materials. Thankfully there are plenty of laughs to go around. The movie never lets up and is always interesting, funny and strangely endearing. It is also hilarious watching the two cops return to high school and finding the ways of the past to be just that. Jenko blames the phenomenon simply on the television show, ""Glee"".

Sure the movie is offensive at times, but the chemistry between Tatum and Hill is authentic and fun to watch. You get invested in their characters personalities early on and you are with them to the end.",1333324800,21,1683,4.8776223776223775
8408754,3,B003Y5H5BA,"It was amusing enough for what it was. I was actually pleasantly surprised as to how well Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum worked together; that was really the driving force behind the movie's appeal, in my opinion. I also liked that Channing Tatum came across as vulnerable -- he has a reasonable amount of acting range. I wouldn't watch this movie again but I would be comfortable casually suggesting it to another person (if they asked about it, of course...I wouldn't just automatically leap to suggesting it. It wasn't that memorable, lol.)",1528243200,,542,4.9021739130434785
