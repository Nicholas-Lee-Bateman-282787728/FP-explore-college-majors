8484332,4,B005RT5M2U,"I think this film saw only very limited distribution outside of Australia. It is a tiny step removed from a student film - blown up from a 16mm original, but, given the limitations of the source material, this DVD looks pretty decent. The film is a rather free adaptation of a play by David Williamson, especially in the inclusion of a lot of sophomoric humor (crude but funny). A few moments are truly classic (you will probably never look at an oyster on a canape tray without smiling, after seeing what Bruce Spence does with one). It's too adult to be a teenage comedy, and too anarchic to be an adult story. There's nudity (Jacki Weaver at her most spectacular) but not enough to qualify as any kind of sex comedy. In short, it doesn't have much of a niche to occupy. It does, however, feature some actors who became staples of the Aussie film industry, such as Spence, Weaver and Blundell. All in all, it's a rather engaging and free-spirited look at young adults in early 1970s urban Australia. Perhaps a bit of unintentional anthropology.
