6358602,4,B00JHH1ZUQ,"This is another teacher saves the underprivileged kid movie. Dino  (Christina Ricci) is an American teacher working in Australia. She is engaged to Simon (Daniel Henshall) and has issues with him and PLOT SPOILER her sexual identity. She teaches 11th grade drama at a predominant  Aboriginal school, ""kids at risk."" She plans on saving Liam Wood (Hunter Page-Lochard) by having him perform Hamlet.

Liam has his own issues. His father (Matt Nable) is in jail. His brother Steve (Mark Coles Smith) is a hooligan. He has a love interest that doesn't develop. His uncle was killed and Steve wants Liam to help him perform an honor killing, something Liam is clearly not cut out for. The film also attempts to show that Hamlet has universal themes that transcend cultures.

This is an okay film, but clearly not the best in the genre. It has one or two light scenes, but could of had some more. The girl/girl action could have been deleted. That was a WTF scene that didn't bode well with the rest of the film.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Brief FF sex scene. Brief nudity. 3 1/2 STARS",1407628800,4,1077,4.677248677248677
6358603,3,B00JHH1ZUQ,"I don't recall seeing Christina Riccis face since when she was on The Good Wife and Pan Am back in 2012, so its nice to see, two years later, she is still working. Though with this being your usual white Savior type film, it does make you wonder if this was really that good of a choice for her. Well, read below to find out.

Characters & Story
Dino (Christina Ricci) has just recently returned to Austrailia, after going to college there, due to her boyfriend Simon (Daniel Henshall). But, just because she may have moved to a different country for a man, don't think she doesnt have aspirations. Dino seems very into videography, and has a background just right for a local school, which mostly caters to indigenous kids, that is on its last leg.

Enter Liam (Hunter Page-Lochard) who plays the poor, unfortunate student of which Dino focuses on. Liam lives with his mother and brother Steve (Mark Coles Smith), and his father is in jail. Though with how Steve is steering his life, and tries to steer Liams, it seems eventually his mother maybe living in their home alone. But Dino tries to prevent this by getting Liam involved in her Hamlet production. However, with Steve wanting to pursue revenge for his uncles death, and wanting Liam to help, will Dino get to save this one kid or will he fall through the cracks?

Praise
Honestly, when I was writing this I placed what is in the criticism as praise. But, thinking about it, honestly with every bit of praise I can fathom comes some form of disappointment. So while it is nice that Liam and Dino got some slightly developed stories, at the end of the day the film sort of ignores what would make two great movies on their own and sadly combines them.

Criticism
For those of you who watch Orange is the New Black, like that show this movie has characters which are, for a lack of a better term, people of color who are far more interesting than the white lead. Liam, for example, has quite a rich story that I wish was more focused on. For between the relationship he has with his family; his friendships, which are sadly unexplored; and this romance he has with Williemai (Madeline Madden), you can see a lot of what could have made the story a bit more compelling was traded in so that Riccis character maintained dominance.

And while it may sound like Im implying Dino wasn't interesting, the truth of the matter is that I just felt that with the potential Dino and Liams story had, mixing the two was just a waste for both of them. For Dino has had quite a life herself. Between her dads suicide, lesbian affairs, and her being closeted, I feel like neither Liam nor Dino got justice for their stories for it was watered down into a white savior film.

Overall: TV Viewing
This is the type of film which simply has wasted potential. It has two perfectly good stories, both which warrant their own film, but in order to fit the mold of a white savior film both stories get diluted and end up ultimately disappointing. But, even with that said, the pieces we are given are interesting enough to warranting seeing this. So, this is being labeled as TV Viewing.",1407024000,6,3122,4.507067137809187

6358620,2,B00JHH1ZUQ,"So much wasted potential here.  I didn't take issue with the acting or casting here... but this script was just awful.

Set in Australia during the 2004 Redfern riots,  Dino Chalmers (Ricci) is a young American Drama teacher who returns to Sydney to be with her boyfriend.  Here she works with inner city youth and believes she will save them via Shakespeare.  The story attempts to focus on her developing relationship with a 16 yr old Aboriginal student who gets the lead in her production of Hamlet. One poorly developed subplot barely revolving around this theme is Dino coming to terms with her repressed sexual orientation (she prefers women yet abandoned a f/f relationship here 5 yrs ago that she never really got over).

Loved the Australian setting and I'm definitely a Christina Ricci fan, but this story was DULL DULL DULL!!!  Ricci doesn't get enough screen time and all these different drama threads felt like a messy, imbalanced hodgepodge of good intentions gone awry. The result is a slow-moving film with shallow, undeveloped relationships and people you don't much know or care about.

The Hamlet in the Hood thread (as another reviewer put it) cracked me up.  Apparently, the Idiots Guide to Saving Inner City Youth via Shakespeare merely involves ordering a box of Hamlet books.  Pass them out to ""disadvantaged"" students and voil!... they are quoting Shakespeare the next day, lol.  That's pretty much how it looked in the film. Because Shakespeare is soooo easy...

And don't come here for the lesbian subplot.  These guys had the lovely Christina Ricci... a cameo by one hot hot hot Ruby Rose... and another cameo of the girl-next-door delicious Andrea Demetriades... and to what end???  Nada.  This subplot is given maybe 5 minutes of the whole movie.  There is one brief and non-graphic sex scene between Ricci and Rose.  I recommend googling that scene instead of watching this whole movie. Or better yet, google Ruby Rose's breathtaking little short called Break Free (on YT) and enjoy some of that awesome eye candy by those who know what to do with a camera and a hot dyke...",1414627200,3,2105,4.884507042253521

8650972,4,B00JHH1ZUQ,"The assessment of ""Around the Block"", for Amazon-U.S. and Amazon-Canada, that Navy veteran, ""Movie Guy"" made is on the mark. The film is enjoyable, for the most part, but not a first-class effort or production. It is one of those ""life parallels"" films to a Shakespeare play, this one to ""Hamlet"", rather than, as so often, to ""Macbeth"", ""King Lear"", or ""Romeo and Juliet"", and so on. The parallels are just a tad too heavy-handed and obvious to be considered as artistically satisfying. So are the social, sexual (including lesbian), poverty, and other issues that the film tackles, with varying success. I certainly can vouch that the movie's editing was wise to exclude the deleted scenes which one sees among the DVD's bonuses; those bits of the film, had they been included, only would have weighted it down with even clumsier didacticism and with yet heavier doses of the sentiments which, in already too great supply, flaw so much of that which appears elsewhere in the movie.

For the most part, the mainly Australian cast speaks understandably enough for a Canadian or American audience to understand easily. Nonetheless, in an edition aimed at the North American market, subtitles definitely would have been helpful, the more so for those, like myself, who are somewhat hard-of-hearing, but, at least on the edition viewed (Ramdom Media RM-4400), they were not provided. It helped me, as compensation for that, to read the reviews, which reveal much of the synopsis of the movie, that I found readily enough on the Web, done by Joe Leydon for ""Variety"" magasine's site and another written up for ""The Hollywood Reporter"" by David Rooney. What one finds about the film on the IMDb (Internet Movie Database) and on Wikipedia simply, in each case, is too skimpy to offer much help. The reviews referred to both were quite negative, too much so in my view, especially for a film showcasing so well the extraordinary talents of Hunter Page-Lochard, the young Australian Aborigine actor who depicts Liam Wood's character, the one who is in the school production cast of ""Hamlet"" in the title role of Shakespeare's play.

I first saw Hunter Page-Lochard in ""The Sapphires"", an Australian musical film in which he played a bit part. Even in that context, it was clear to my eyes that this cutely attractive young dude is very gifted as a film actor. Here, in ""Around the Block"", the script gives him magnificent opportunities to shine; his dramatic intensity and boundless involvement in the film make the best of even the most over-the-top excesses or uncomfortably smarmy sentiment in the script of his scenes. Page-Lochard acts all of his part, the good and the tawdry alike which writer-director Sarah Spillane provided for the motion picture, so well, with such magnificent screen presence, that he raises an otherwise mediocre film to a cinematic work of genuine and gripping interest. For comment on the contributions of the other actors in the cast, what the clutch of good reviews on Amazon, on its U.S. and other national Web sites, have to say suffices, therefore I shall not prolong my own comments on the movie to deal with their contributions. For Hunter Page-Lochard's sake, this movie definitely is worth viewing!",1438560000,,3231,4.970425138632162
