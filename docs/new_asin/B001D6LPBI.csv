8291933,5,B001D6LPBI,"Right, we are from the UK, so we already have a PAL format DVD. Funny how people here seem to think there is only one region for dvd...
I remember seeing this film on television. It is a charming and beautiful story. We have enjoyed this film every year for Halloween.",1379548800,,268,4.2745098039215685
8291934,5,B001D6LPBI,"I saw this on a kids' TV station yeas ago and wished I had recorded it. It had an old-fashioned feel to it and very appropriate for young viewers: charming is how I would describe it. I was thrilled when I found it, however, it was not set up to play on U.S. television. My son figured out how to transfer it so I could re-record it and play it on my dvd player, but I couldn't tell you how. I would recommend this to anyone. I enjoyed it myself and am happy to have it in my collection or kid's movies.",1370390400,,503,3.9411764705882355

8291937,3,B001D6LPBI,"My son saw this on Cartoon Network a year or two ago and just loved it. I tried to find the DVD on many occasions, only to be disappointed in my inability to find it from a seller in the US. When I found it on Amazon through a seller in California, I was ecstatic...especially since my son's birthday was fast approaching. It took about 1 month to arrive, so it did miss the big day, but we were thrilled when it arrived. Unfortunately, once we got it we found that it would not work in our DVD player as it was a ""Region 2"" DVD. Apparently, ""DVD region codes are a digital-rights management technique designed to allow film distributors to control aspects of a release, including content, release date, and price, according to the region. DVD video discs may be encoded with a region code restricting the area of the world in which they can be played."" (Wikipedia)

The title on the listing said ""Spooky Bats & Scaredy Cats [Region 2]"". I didn't know what the ""Region 2"" meant and to be honest, I didn't even pay attention to it. I knew nothing of DVD Regions prior to making this purchase. As a consumer, I should have done the research  before I purchased the DVD, so I take full responsibility for the confusion and ultimate disappointment that arose after we discovered that we were not, after all, going to be able to enjoy the DVD. I will not make the same mistake again.

Though I do take responsibility, I wonder why Amazon does not require there to be a brief explanation of such codes within a seller's listing; a disclaimer of sorts, that gives the consumer a ""heads-up"" about the purchase they are about to make. Why didn't the seller feel it necessary to provide that information in the listing? Maybe something as simple as ""Please be aware that Region 2 DVDs can only be played in the following countries..."" or perhaps a asterisk and a chart listing the different regions and their corresponding countries.

I did discover that certain DVD players are capable of having their settings changed in order to play DVDs from other regions. Unfortunately, I do not have one of those types of DVD players. I was also told that the DVD may work in an XBOX 360 or other gaming system. I only have a Wii, which does not play DVDs at all. I am not about to go out and buy a new DVD player or gaming system in order to play a $2.50, used DVD. If you have one of these types of players or gaming systems and are frustrated with a Region 2 DVD, give it a shot.

Though Spooky Bats & Scaredy Cats is a great movie for kids and Halloween enthusiasts, be careful when purchasing it.  Watch out for Region Codes (try to stick to Region 1), do your research and be prepared to ask the seller to explain anything that looks ambiguous.",1317600000,3,2731,4.408730158730159
8291938,3,B001D6LPBI,"I paid for 2 day shipping on this however it didn't get shipped out by the company til after a week after I ordered it, and I can only play it on one dvd player in my house!",1288569600,,173,3.5789473684210527
