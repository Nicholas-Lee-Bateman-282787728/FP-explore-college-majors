6998098,3,B00SZLEL2Y,"That's where I first saw CONVOY, at the drive-in theater, and it's certainly a classic of it's type, long on comedy, action, red-necks and trucks. Sort of SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT meets WHITE LIGHTNING meets VIGILANTE FORCE meets CANNONBALL. Perfect drive-in fodder. However, after RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY, THE WILD BUNCH, THE GETAWAY and even ALFREDO GARCIA this film about Rubber Duck and his pals was a huge disappointment for me. Not that it's bad, it's really not, it's just that it's not really very good either. I've since heard that Peckinpah was so whacked out on drugs and booze while shooting CONVOY that friends had to step in and take over for him, including actor James Coburn. In this respect I'm really looking forward to the commentary offered here by true Peckinpah experts Paul Seydor, Nick Redman and Garner Simmons on the making of this interesting yet confusing Peckinpah film. And Convoy truly does warrant the classy release that Kino will give it, after all, it was Peckinpah's highest grossing film ever. All those drive-ins really made a bundle off of this one!",1426636800,11,1083,4.891304347826087

6998126,5,B00SZLEL2Y,"Long considered a ""troubled"" Sam Peckinpah film, that general opinion was compounded by the fact that there wasn't a decent DVD edition of Convoy to make it any easier for us regular and irregular folk to make a judgemental decision either way.

All that has changed now that Kino has remastered it and slathered on more special features than I would have ever thought possible (the well-produced & exclusive retrospective documentary about the feature alone is nearly as long as the movie itself).

So make sure that your DVD is the Kino edition (ordered mine directly from Amazon) and you will be grateful that you did.

But is it a good movie?

I had never seen it before, so watching it with unblemished expectations, I have to admit I enjoyed the living highway out of it. As a drive-in-type feature film, it entertained and had enough great acting, action, and impressive cinematography to fill the void I was nursing that evening.

Afterwards I watched the documetary and then immediately rewatched the main feature with the running commentary selected, and it wasn't until then that I realized why it wasn't very highly regarded by Peckinpah fanatics, but that made it even more enjoyable due to the feeling that I was being educated in the process (plus it did not change the fact that it is one fun piece of cinema).

I've come to the decision that a ""troubled"" Sam Peckinpah film can beat up most other director's ""untroubled"" films.

And that? That'll be that.",1517270400,2,1472,4.794466403162056

6998153,4,B00SZLEL2Y,"I recall watching this movie when I was a young kid on TV. I liked it and I liked the song, which was a hit back in the day. It's more nostalgia now, but if you like trucker movies of the era, you may like this one as well. Don't expect it to look brand new, it was made in '77/'78. I think Kino Lorber, the newest distributor of the movie, did a great job here on this edition. It's not only widescreen format, but has some good special features as well.
Look around for some good deals, however, because I found a brand new copy for 5 bucks at a local retailer.
Kris Kristofferson was in a huge movie with Barbara Streisand in 1976, I believe, called ""When A Star Is Born"". A remake of the Judy Garland movie.
Ernest Borgnine was in ""The Poseidon Adventure"" in '77 with an all star cast and was a prominent actor in the decade. Also starring in ""Willard"", the one with the Rats.
I'm not familiar with Ali MacGraw, but this movie could be one of her earliest, if not her first.
One of the DJ's in the radio station is that of John Amos, who would play the Father in the TV Series ""Good Times"" for a few seasons.",1496620800,,1112,4.105504587155964

6998155,5,B00SZLEL2Y,Love the movie,1496448000,,14,4.0
6998156,3,B00SZLEL2Y,"Here's a trucker movie from the 1970s; sort of in a similar vein as Hal Needham's ""Smokey and the Bandit"" and ""Cannonball Run"". Though I was just a kid when this movie first came out, I never watched it all the way through until now. Although, I do remember that the theme song to ""Convoy"" was once tremendously popular and played frequently on the radio.

Unlike Needham's car crash movies, ""Convoy"" director Sam Peckinpah attempts to capture a more artistic conception that redefines the Western genre. Even so, you still have the renegade hero (Kris Kristofferson) and the woman who pops up out of nowhere (Ali McGraw) as well as the crooked sheriff (Ernest Borgnine). In this regard, I'd say that while a good many supporting characters seem to add flavor to the movie (including the rustic Burt Young as ""Love Machine/Pig Pen"", Franklyn Ajaye as ""Spider Mike"", Madge Sinclair as ""Black Widow"" and most of all, the legendary Ernest Borgnine as the antagonist, ""Dirty Lyle""); the two main characters (Kris Kristofferson as ""Rubber Duck"" and Ali McGraw as ""Melissa) failed to the generate the appropriate chemistry and I didn't think that Kristofferson's presence was particularly compelling.

All-in-all I'd say that ""Convoy"", though entertaining, lacks the air of profoundness that it seems to want to attain, and parts of it now seem corny and camp.

While kids and preteens might like the car and truck crashes, and an impressive fight scene; parents should be cautioned that there is some foul language as well as suggestive (though technically not nude) scene early in the movie where the main character (""Rubber Duck"") attempts to have a quick ""dalliance"" with a truck stop waitress in the back of his cab. Other than that, the only other thing that may be questionable is when a trucker moons a government employee.",1496361600,2,1825,4.957516339869281

6998164,4,B00SZLEL2Y,"My husband and I spent some time talking about this movie one night and decided we'd get it and see if it stood the test of time for us.
What we found out was that it didn't stand the test of time. It did not reflect our memories of this (more on this later)

Having said that though, we enjoyed watching this movie. The CB Talk brought back memories for both of us. We both recalled a time back in the 70's when truckers were seemingly faster and at odds with the cops. We also enjoyed watching the driving of the truck drivers in this show. As a former truck driver this was a fun rollick.

So, how did it not stand the test of time? We both commented on the fact that this movie 'moves slower' than we remembered. We remembered this movie as a rollicking,  fast moving movie, full of excitement and heart thumping car/truck chases. It wasn't that. It moved slower and instead what we remembered were the few chase scenes. We also didn't remember some of the characters that added to the fun of the movie.

One of the things we enjoyed was that this was set in our homestate mostly. We were able to watch it and see parts of our city or surrounding towns. However, the scenes jumped from one place to another with no continuity for us because we knew the scenery which made it a bit disconcerting to watch. We'd see them driving down one road in one city and then another road in another town and then down a dirt road in yet another area of our state. Once we stopped paying attention to where they were in reality (vs movie land) it was more enjoyable.

One of our favorite parts was the pastor that joined the group. Him and his group were always singing and their singing was terrible and off key. There was not so much of it to be annoying but enough of it to add to the humor. And as a bit of trivia, I believe that the pastor used to be Kris Kristofferson's drummer.

We agreed it is a four star movie because it is a some what slow paced movie. Otherwise we really had a fun time watching this show and we'll probably watch it a few more times in the next few months.

Enjoy.",1493078400,,2085,4.1975

6998202,4,B00SZLEL2Y,"Finally!!! The version of CONVOY I've been waiting for!

I bought that crappy ""CHEESY FLICKS"" release a couple of years ago and was disgusted. The picture quality was lousy with a weird ""Stretch Screen"" effect rather than a true Widescreen. Sound was awful. And more importantly, they cut out about 3mins from a semi-important scene with regards to character and plot development. Additionally, they put their dumb ""CHEESY FLICKS"" logo over the old EMI Productions logo.  So if you want to make sure you're getting a true, honest-to-God release of this classic action film, make sure you buy this version from KL Productions (distributed by MGM and 20th Century).

The picture and sound quality are great. The extras are a nice added package as well as the DVD Commentary by the same group of Sam Peckinpah historians who commented on The Wild Bunch, Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid, The Getaway, etc. So you're getting an interesting commentary. It's even more interesting when the commentators stop talking because there is little to talk about although they do have some interesting bits to say. For instance: Did you know that the waitress that Rubber Duck (Kris Kristofferson) has an encounter with at the truck stop is Sherriff ""Dirty"" Lyle Wallace's wife???? I didn't know that and you can't really tell from the finished film but apparently it's in the script.

But the crown jewel to this version of the release (in my opinion) is the restored 3mins of footage cut out from the Cheesy Flicks release and subsequent TV and Streaming versions. It centers around the moment when the press agent, Chuck Renaldi is on the flatbed truck talking to Rubber Duck. When he asks RD what the purpose of the convoy was, RD basically tells him to ask the other truckers. The part where Renaldi talks to the other truckers is cut out. The only part that remained is when he speaks to the preacher in the hippie bus. But what was missing when they cut the scene down was important to the plot and the character of Rubber Duck. As far as RD is concerned, he is simply a fugitive truck driver trying to escape Dirty Lyle (Ernest Borgnine). But when he hears the other truckers talking to Renaldi over the CB about their own thoughts about the convoy, he becomes uneasy because the other truckers view him as sort of a cult or protest leader to a cause. He doesn't want to be a symbol or a martyr. And it's important because it plays into the scenes later in the film when he abandons most of the truckers following him. Now that the scene is fully restored, the guts of the character has been restored. For me, that's the most important thing.

So if you are a fan of the film or have seen bits of it on TV, this is the version to buy. It's worth the money.",1473897600,,2744,4.580448065173116

6998221,5,B00SZLEL2Y,"First off - I am not one to go gaga over audio and video - But I have to say - being this movie is as old as it is, it really REALLY stands out what a good job they did with the transfer - if you watch this blu ray - you will think this movie could have been made a year ago with how good it looks - there is nothing to indicate it is an older movie - it looks and sounds like a movie made in 2015.

That said - out of the 70s road chase/ car crash movies, this may be the best.  Just a REALLY cool movie.  Kris Kristofferson is great in it and really cool, Ali McGraw is HOT, and the supporting cast is great - Borgnine had fun with this role, you can tell.

And as much story as there can be in a movie like this, it is pretty darn good - the movie goes fast, because it is entertaining.  This is definitely a good movie to have in your collection.  A classic 70s genre movie.  I can't wait to watch it again. And I LOVE that song!",1460937600,,933,3.7055837563451774

Worth the money, and seems like the movie was longer this time, like the original.  once in a while, you can see where the crew didn't clean up a scene or two, but that is due to the original film quality which is not so good.  If you want to see Convoy like you saw it as a kid, this is a bargain.  Also, the acting in the movie comes off better in this version.  On a smaller tv, you can't see all the subtleties, but here, the acting really comes through, and the music fits the scenes better too.",1456963200,,543,4.037383177570093

Although there is no subtitles,th movie comes with great artwork for the case(No Slipcase however).The Bonus features alone are worth buying the New Release(2015) DVD and Blu-Ray. There is a Convoy fan in Germany who owns A Rubber Duck Mack RL700L which sounds so beautiful and looks beautiful. The color and sounds are great, Movie Lobby cards are shown in the special features along with a Documentary on Peckinpah(I am not a Fan of His at all but I always loved Convoy,which unfortunately a lot of movie snobs and Peckinpah fanboys dismiss such as the so-called scholars on the audio commentary of this edition.)There are three Deleted scenes which are more like snapshots since the scenes were lost forever. The Movie is a Classic and perhaps the Trucker Movie of all trucker Movies, it is a fun film and Ernest Borgnine and Burt Young are my favorite characters in the movie. If you are into Trucker Movies/Culture/Rigs like me and Into Convoy you have to get the New 2015 Dvd and Blu-Ray(Sadly sold separate).",1442275200,5,1267,4.953051643192488
6998253,5,B00SZLEL2Y,"This is/was the first trucker movie that I ever got to see back in the 1980s when it was released in VHS form.  I loved it then and I still love it now so many years later after the filming.

There is one ""blooper"" that can be seen in the movie:  It's where The Duck's Mack truck gets blown off of the bridge (you can see Kris getting down on the floor of the cab of the truck a few times during this sequence) and if you watch closely, when it goes back to the scene before the truck hits the water, you can definitely see ""someone"" steering the truck!  There are a couple of other little fun bloopers (except for ""The Widow Woman's"" crash around that sharp turn - that was TOTALLY real and unscripted - thankfully, she wasn't hurt).

I'm gonna watch this movie again on DVD tomorrow for the first time in a while - and I can't wait!!!  I love the opening theme and scene of R.D. driving along the highway until he meets up with, who else?  Ali McGraw - and she's supposedly got nothing on except for the top she's wearing!

The transfer is very good with a bit of graininess now and then, but remember, the movie is 37 years old and Hollywood didn't know it would become a cult classic.

Instead it's actually a really fun road movie with some cool stunts, I love it, I think it gets the shaft because it's a Peckinpah film and maybe it gets compared a little too much to his bonafide classic films. This isn't an all time film classic, but it's an incredibly fun movie where the characters and action are a little more important than the story. Think of this as kind of like a lesser ""Smokey and the Bandit"", the story isn't as strong as that film, but they're both the same kind of fun.",1432166400,12,657,4.306451612903226

6998284,4,B00SZLEL2Y,"Great transfer - easily the best Region 1 release of CONVOY to date.  A nice snapshot of the American Southwest in the mid-late 1970s.

The bonus documentary was quite good.  The commentary was OK,  but the constant derision of the movie by the commentators got a bit old.  While their knowledge of Peckinpah was nice, a lot of what they talked about was also covered in the documentary.  I would have rather liked having someone who was involved with the production or was a enthusiastic fan of the movie in commentary.

One nitpick - why did no one interview Chip Davis regarding the music, for the bonus materials here?  Granted, there wasn't a lot of original music in the movie, but after hearing about all the troubles of production, I'd have liked to have heard Chip's perspective regarding the scoring.  (I'm glad that EMI hired him, effectively getting C.W. McCall's backing band to do the music - and it's worth noting that those guys were also the people behind Mannheim Steamroller)

Too bad no copy of the director's cut has survived though, that would have been interesting.  Still, I'm very glad this movie has finally gotten a quality USA release - I pre-ordered it the instant I heard about it coming up.",1431388800,2,1221,4.712264150943396

6998286,5,B00SZLEL2Y,This movie is worth the upgrade to Blu-ray. The picture and sound have both been remastered in HD.  And this movie definitely definitely looks better on Blu-ray sounds better on Blu-ray then it did with my old DVD copy.,1430265600,13,219,4.615384615384615
6998287,5,B00SZLEL2Y,"It's been quite some time since I've seen this movie.  I was five years old when the movie came out but I remember watching it on TV with my father some years later.  We might of owned a VHS copy of it too.  The film looks great in this Blu-ray release and it is definitely the cleanest version I've ever seen.  I'm no Convoy movie expert, but it appears to be an unedited version as well.  I've read some reviews where people complain that certain scenes are missing from earlier versions (such as the DVD release) and I was looking for those particular scenes and they are in this release.  The movie runs 110 minutes while some of the other releases only ran for 106 minutes.

The movie, as stated before, certainly looks nice on my HDTV and the sound quality is great too.  The film isn't perfect looking and it still shows some age in certain scenes but I personally haven't seen anything better when I compare it to the TV and VHS versions that I've watched before.  It was great watching it again and brings me back to the days of being a kid and watching Smokey and the Bandit, Dukes of Hazzard, and Cannonball Run.  As a kid, Convoy (and movies like it) was just comic cool silliness with big trucks (or fast cars) ""taking it to the man"".  Watching it now, I even see an attempt at some sort of heroic message here but the real draw to the film is basically a western using big rigs.  The soundtrack for the movie is just great and I can remember just loving (and singing) the original Convoy song which was the inspiration for the film.  It great fun to see this picture again and it brings back some great memories.

This release comes with some great special features too.  The 73 minute documentary entitled ""Passion & Poetry - Sam's Trucker Movie"" is really interesting.  It goes through all of the trials and tribulations all involved went through during the production.  The actors, producers, and techies speak about director Sam Peckinpah's downfall with cocaine and all of the problems it caused during the production.  It's amazing that the film was ever even released.  The documentary shows the eventual success of the film not only in the US but around the world.  They even show a guy in Germany who was so obsessed with the film that he had a replica of Duck's truck made for himself!  The movie turned out to be very profitable but unfortunately marked the end of Sam Peckinpah's career.  It's a great documentary and fans of the film will surely find it very interesting.  Another 3 minute featurette entitled ""Trucker Notes From Norway"" has a fan (from Norway) give us a history of the truck(s) used in the film.  This movie sure has a big following overseas!  The 5 minute feature entitled ""Injokes, Friends & Cameos"" was especially interesting because it contains some great ""fun facts"" that I didn't know about.  I didn't know that Sam Peckinpah was in the film.  You can see him riding in the back of the truck with the TV guy interviewing ""The Duck"".  Also, the names of the companies on the trucks are little salutes to the actor's (driving the trucks) previous roles in other films.  Some of you Convoy fans probably knew all of this but I sure didn't.  There are three deleted scenes, but we can only see production stills and images of the script for these because the original footage was destroyed.  The special features are really great and I enjoyed watching all of these after viewing the film.

Kino Lorber has done a great job putting this together.  The movie looks great and the special features are awesome.  Convoy fans should pick this one up for sure.",1430179200,31,3601,4.548989113530326

So if you don't have a Blu-ray player like me......you will have to buy the DVD version separate anyway. So either buy the DVD or Blu-ray....but NOT the multi-format....as its just the Blu-ray version.",1533513600,,359,5.428571428571429

8699951,5,B00SZLEL2Y,And all time favorite Trucking movie,1533254400,,36,5.166666666666667
8699952,1,B00SZLEL2Y,"This is a dog of a movie - with apologies to K9s around the world. The scenes were put on and what could have been cinematic brilliance - replete with scenery from the western US - instead follows a cheesy narrative throughout.

The acting was forced. The only believable actor was Ernest Borgnine, who appears to be struggling to buoy up the entire cast.

The first minute or so is the best part - the scenery, music and truck rolling down the lonesome highway, and it goes downhill from there. A struggle to watch, and huge disappointment.",1532995200,,541,4.56701030927835

8699955,5,B00SZLEL2Y,"I love this movie and have wanted to own it for years. Ever since childhood I have had a soft spot for truck drivers, have loved the song Convoy by C.W. McCall and have openly enjoyed this admittedly cheesy 70's movie. Now I own it and am beyond thrilled.",1529193600,,255,4.224489795918367
