8216834,5,B000V6LTBC,"Mike Freeman who wrote Memphis Elvis Style is your guide for this trip around Memphis. He takes you to many of Elvis's favorite sites, as well as places that were important to Elvis. There are several interviews with people who knew and worked with Elvis. You will hear things that you have not heard in other DVD's. One of the highlights is a trip to Lauderdale Courts, now called Union Square, where we get to tour the inside of the real Presley apartment, which is now decorated as it would have been when they lived there. It is a true find for the price and you will feel like you have had a wonderful tour of Elvis's Memphis.",1209859200,5,631,4.3559322033898304
