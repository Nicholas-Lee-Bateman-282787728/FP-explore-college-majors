2553713,5,B000F6ZCHK,"This DVD is of a quality one would expect from the History Channel.
It features a lot of original Studebaker footage, some I have not seen before, it also covers the basic history of Studebaker, which all adds weight to the importance that was placed on the Avanti to try and save Stude, as did the Lark in its day.
Overall, this DVD is a must for any Stude fan.",1275436800,,362,4.185714285714286
2553714,4,B000F6ZCHK,"Good video typical quality of the History Channel.  Complete documentary of the car, the company and the men that made it happen.  The Avanti is the Corvette made by Studebaker and later by thoes that took over its manufacturing on a small scale basis.  This is a very interesting story if you have not heard it.  The Avanti is a hot collector car like the vet.  It broke records in its day and still has a very interesting character.  The Avanti was a top line (expensive & fast) rare car.",1185926400,,490,4.388888888888889

8118420,5,B000F6ZCHK,"I have enjoyed a number of the History Channel's ""Automobiles"" series and this one was no exception. I was both surprised and pleased that the Sudebaker Avanti was a subject of one of their episodes.

The DVD (this is a DVD-R, by the way) sets the stage, as it were, by giving a brief history of Studebaker as a company with its roots as a ""horse and buggy"" era maker of wagons. It continues the brief summary of Studebaker as a maker of small, practical and affordable cars. The DVD covers the business climate in which Studebaker was one of the small auto companies in post-WWII America with all the disadvantages of being the ""little guy"" with less access to financing and less able to sustain mistakes. It also covers the changes in management and design philosophy over the years leading up to the Avanti.

The video does a pretty good job showing how Raymond Loewy's design team took up the challenge to create a new car that would be ahead of its time in styling and image. It covers the mechanical's of the car - basically a Lark underneath the beautiful body. It covers all the promotional and marketing angles of the car's introduction as well as the attempts to tie it to high performance.

The Avanti generated a great deal of interest for Studebaker but, alas, it was an interest that couldn't be satisfied. The fact of the matter was that Studebaker had trouble actually making them! By the time they had worked out the bugs with the fiberglass bodies and other production issues, the interest had already waned for the Avanti. It was the last gasp for Studebaker and with the Avanti's fall, Studebaker ceased being a maker of autos.

Not the end, though, since a former Studebaker salesman bought the tooling and the Avanti lived on for several decades more as a low-volume car made by the tiny Avanti Motors. They'd make a couple hundred a year for people who wanted something different looking (the Avanti certainly was that!) and had the money to pay for it. Eventually, even Avanti Motors failed and the Avanti is now just a footnote in automotive design.

If you are interested in the Avanti, this is a good video with lots of period film footage, current video of surviving models and interviews with members of Loewy's design team. There's a lot of information packed in this 50-minute video and I recommend it with 5 stars!",1379203200,2,2346,4.643373493975903
8118421,5,B000F6ZCHK,This is a must for Avanti owners.  The History Channel always does a great job covering collector cars.  Recommended for your collection.,1354147200,,137,5.181818181818182
8118422,5,B000F6ZCHK,"This DVD has a running time of about 45 minutes, and it is a transcription of the Automobiles episode that originally aired on History Channel in the early 2000s.

In the short time alloted, the disc does a pretty good job of setting up the storied history of the Studebaker Corporation that began with building wagons for pioneers moving to the western US and culminating with last gasp of the Avanti in the early 1960s.  Amazingly, the Avanti lived on into the 21st century as a limited production car through a litany of fits and sarts.  The disc does a balanced job of displaying the fascinating industrial design process that spawned the Avanti and why Studebaker felt it necessary.  One wonders what might have been if Studebaker had not had to endure the financial missteps of Russel Erskine in the 1930s and sudden loss of its visionary leader Sherwood Egbert in the 1960s.  Studebaker is the Charlie Brown of the US car companies, seemingly always getting its kite caught in the tree just when the wind is good.  The Avanti story is the quintessential could've, would've, should've story and this disc does a nice job of answering some burning questions and asking others.

This disc is a must-have for your library if you are an Avanti owner.",1290816000,,1252,4.741935483870968
