3945710,5,B002LE8MP8,"There have been alot of movies made about soccer through the years, most of them have been awful, Escape to victory and A shot at glory are two that that spring to mind, this is the first great movie on the sport. It is set in the 70's around Brian Clough's short spell as the Leeds manager and his confrontations with the players, the previous manager and the board. It is certainly not as glamours as todays game and the producers really capture the spirit of the 70's,with Dodgy stadiums, rubbish playing surfaces, bad haircuts and terrible fashion. This story may not be 100% accurate and some of the footballer's don't look like athletes, but you can over look this because you get a gripping story and some excellent perfomances from some of britains best actors. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has an interest in British football.",1257206400,6,850,4.673333333333333

3945723,5,B002LE8MP8,"This film is an embarrassment of riches: great true story, fantastic screenplay, amazing cast of actors, and an absolutely brilliant production design. Designer Eve Stewart is keen to capture the textures of the periodwood board construction, brick walls, chipping paint, solid wood furniture, wood paneling, busy wallpaper, wool tweed, and so much more. Did I mention wood. The viewer begins to look forward to Stewart's rich design walking into each scene, like a favorite cast character, and giving a warm embrace. DP Ben Smithard never passes up an opportunity to showcase England's famous natural environmentgray skies, cumulous clouds back-lit by the sun, the ubiquitous green foliage. The filmmakers want to transport you to that time and place, and they succeed mightily. This is a true story from the world of professional soccer in the 1960s and 70s, and there are a lot of elements that naturally propel a captivating tale like this. One of Tom Hooper's jobs is to stay out of the story's way.  But his biggest challenge is portraying the relationship between Clough and Taylor.  And this is where The Damned United doesn't fall into the usual trap whereby sports films tryand usually failto impart to the viewer the feelings of loyalty and affection that an entire team of players has towards a beloved coach. Hooper and screenwriter Morgan instead focus on the loyalty and affection between two men, and Sheen and Spall are flawless capturing the professional collaboration, the resonating emotions, and the personal imperfections as the two weather storms together.  It's never cheesy, never sappy--always genuine, and very convincing. The production design's textures beautifully (intentionally?) compliment the textures of this relationship between two fascinating individuals. As one watches the relationship unfold, you feel you've been given a front row seat to the intimacies between two very close friends. And that's a very good seat to be in. Check out Morgan's excellent Frost/Nixon as well, also with Sheen.",1442793600,,2032,5.32398753894081

3945726,5,B002LE8MP8,"This is a great movie.  It has a lot more to do with human nature than sports.  All the actors are excellent.  Brian was a man who had much to be proud of in his accomplishments.  He had a job doing what he loved in the game he loved:  football (soccer).  He had a great friend working by his side.  His undoing came because he could not keep his ego in check.  It cost him the job he loved and what should have been a life-long friendship.  He was too aware of his own capabilities and not aware enough of the people around him.  Although this story is a tragedy between what was and what could have been, it is presented with humor and grace.  It brings a lesson that we all should learn.  To recognize the value of what we have and appreciate those who have helped us along the way and not to take things too seriously.",1435449600,,822,4.10062893081761

3945729,5,B002LE8MP8,"In 1974 Leeds United, the reigning English champions, have a vacancy for a football manager (i.e., head coach). They pick Brian Clough who had recently resigned as manager of Derby County. Clough had fallen out with the team's owner. The film is primarily about the 44 days Clough spent in charge of Leeds. Clough replaced Don Revie who had turned Leeds into one of the best teams in Europe. Revie's popularity with the Leeds players created a problem for the insecure Clough. Clough won only one of his first six League matches and was fired.

Damned United is very entertaining. Michael Sheen is brilliant as Clough. Peter Morgan (The Queen, Rush) wrote a clever script. The film is superbly directed by Oscar winner Tom Hooper (John Adams, The King's Speech, Les Misrables). The film is fun to watch, but it is  very loosely based on fact.

The film makes Clough seem more sympathetic than he appeared in the 1970s. Many people found Clough rude and arrogant. He also had an amazing ability to alienate people. The real Clough also had a long battle with alcohol. Clough's methods were unique. He was essentially an autocrat, and not always a benevolent one, sometimes punching or slapping his players. His bullying did not work at Leeds with experienced players. The film also explores his relationship with Peter Taylor (played by Timothy Spall). Taylor was his number two. He discovered little known players that nobody else seemed to rate and would mould them into top-class players.

Most of the Leeds players who lived through Clough's 44 days have complained that the film does not portray the events fairly or accurately. Clough tells the Leeds players they are cheats and the film implies that Clough was right. Three Leeds players: Billy Bremner, Norman Hunter and Johnny Giles, are shown as boorish thugs. All three have been inducted into English football's Hall of Fame. They were tough, but they were also skillful footballers. Bremner is now dead, and some Leeds players were particularly incensed at the way he was portrayed. Peter Lorimer, a Leeds player who played at the 1974 World Cup has described Clough as a childish lunatic. He claimed that Clough hated Don Revie. What is strange is that both managers had a lot in common. They came from the same Yorkshire town and both were English internationals. Lorimer has claimed that Clough seemed jealous of Revie.

Clough's record, after he left Leeds, was remarkable. He won the European Cup (now called the Champions League) twice with Nottingham Forest, an English provincial side. Forest no longer play in the Premier League. After Clough's 44 days, Leeds had a successful season and reached the final of the European Cup, only to lose in controversial circumstances to the German side Bayern Munich. Overall, I enjoyed the movie.",1426896000,,2805,4.946921443736731

When I saw most of this movie on Starz I was intrigued I read up on the real life story it was based and I knew I had to see the whole thing. Brian Clough was correct what he said about where he and Don Revie would be in 5 years from where the movie ended. Clough took Nottingham Forrest to the European Cup (now UEFA Champions League) twice, something Revie couldn't do with Leeds United. And Revie pretty tainted his legacy after coaching in the UAE.

Today Derby County and Leeds United aren't the huge powerhouses they were back than.

3945743,4,B002LE8MP8,"Only complaint with this is that we see Clough's (towering) ego, but not his brilliance as a manager.

3945746,5,B002LE8MP8,"These were the days of terraces, muddy pitches, cups of tea in the dressing room and a brutal honesty - the kind of honesty that made you play for a club because you wanted to and supported a team rather than the output of a marketing department. If you only know of the EPL, follow Manchester United, Chelsea and now Man. City because of the glamour, then you will never understand what drove Brian Clough, played brilliantly by Michael Sheen. Clough is a football purist - the kind that sees beauty in a great pass and movement as well as a well taken goal. His failing is that it's these same qualities that he hides behind in his personal battle with the legacy of Don Revie.

Clough's definition of success is not the same as Revie's, nor are his personnel skills. It's this constant battle to impose a new culture that follows a winning culture that has challenged many a managers - the results are never the same, some often leading to total capitulation.

Fantastic acting, realistic, meticulous care in ensuring the players look like the 70s legends. So enjoyable I had to watch it twice.",1390435200,,1097,4.591836734693878

3945753,4,B002LE8MP8,"If you grew up in England in the 70s or 80s, you'll understand that Brian Clough was something of a legend. His career as a footballer saw him score goals at a higher ratio than any other player in England, before an ACL injury forced him to retire. At the age of 30, he started a job in football management.

Clough's career began to take off when he became manager of Derby County in 1967. He brought in Peter Taylor as his assistant and the two turned the club into a successful team, gaining promotion to the top division in 1969. The title refers to Clough's hatred of Leeds United, after being snubbed by Leeds manager Don Revie during an FA Cup tie.

As unlikely as it may seem, Clough eventually went on to manage Leeds United in 1974, but he was sacked after 44 days.

The movie jumps between Clough's time at Leeds, and earlier in his career, showing events that led to his hatred of the team, and the reasons he became manager.

Director Tom Hooper treats Clough like the hero he was, but doesn't ignore the many mistakes he made during his long management career. Having grown up in the era myself, I feel that the movie does a great job creating the look and feel of the 70s. I remember many of the events, and always smile when I think of Brian Clough. He was outspoken and regarded himself as the best manager in the game. He wasn't afraid to criticize his employers, opposing managers, players, or the media. As a result, his interviews were always entertaining as he apparently didn't care what people thought of him.

Michael Sheen perfectly captures the spirit of the man, as well as the voice and the gestures. It's like watching a good impressionist with excellent acting ability. Sheen also worked with writer Peter Morgan on Frost/Nixon and The Queen, playing David Frost and Tony Blair. All three performances are noteworthy and worth your time.

Timothy Spall was a good choice for the role of Peter Taylor, and Hooper manages to convince us that the two were close friends for much of the time they worked together. Their relationship was more important than the relationships with their wives in some ways. Other notable performances come from Colm Meaney as Don Revie and Jim Broadbent as Derby County chairman, Sam Longson.

The story focuses on the effect Clough on those around him, and ends with a brief summary of what he went on to achieve. Although football is the reason all of this happened, the movie doesn't spend much time showing the players in action. It's more about management and the relationships that Clough formed with employers, colleagues, players and fans.

I can't imagine American audiences being very interested in the subject matter, but anyone who was a fan of English football in the 70s will love the nostalgic feel and the accuracy of Sheen's portrayal. It's not hard to see why Tom Hooper has been successful in recent years with The King's Speech and Les Misrables. It's clear that the man knows how to make entertaining movies.",1365897600,,2989,4.658444022770398

The movie is a triumph of soccer history (some of it may have been dramatized) and on a greater scale, the human condition. The Damned United stands up to multiple viewings, and Michael Sheen's acting is so fine in the first 10 minutes that it completely sucks you in.

Brian Clough is Britain's most celebrated soccer coach, because he worked magic with lowly teams repeatedly. Except one. Sheen channels what I imagine Clough would be like with incredible chops.

Can't say enough about it, even if you're not a fan of soccer.

For those of you non-british folk, there are a couple of weird things that took me a bit to figure out:

1) ""Darby county"" is spelled Derby County. ""Darby"" is how the british pronounce ""Derby"". You'll hear it on any modern soccer broadcast between Man U and Man City for instance.

2) Majorca (pronounced in the movie ""me-york-a"") is a vacation getaway popular with Britons. Think of it like Bermuda for Americans.",1356566400,,1025,4.730337078651686

3945759,4,B002LE8MP8,"Original review with 16 votesw deleted by Amazon. I was overseas I heard about this movie, based on a true story about controversial soccer manager Brian Clough.

When I went to see the movie, in San Francisco, I wondered what other people in the theater might think, if they would get it.

Sure enough, non soccer followers, who probably had no clue about Clough or Revie were sucked into the drama of the legendary confrontation, between these two rivals, which surpassed my expectations.

Someone more outpoken and more controversial than Brian Clough would be difficult to imagine, someone destined to become one of the most outstanding managers in the history of English soccer. Don Revie managed League Champions Leeds United. Clough managed Derby County previous years League Champions. Don Revie leaves Leeds to manage England, and Leeds made the bonehead decision to appoint the outspoken Clough in his place, outspoken because of his criticism and dislike of both Revie and the style of play under his management. This outspokenness led to clashes with the players whose successful, although rough style, had led them to incredible success.

As you get further into the movie, I suspect you will get drawn into its surprising twists and turns.

I was particularly impressed with Colm Meaney's portrayal of Revie. At one point I wondered if was actually Revie or Meaney I was watching, if it was actual footage of Revie. Michael Sheen who played Prime Minister Tony Blair in The Queen, nails Clough's distinct accent and outspokenness to a tee. Some of these Leeds players were greats, but the character development is very thin here. I understand that some of these players threatened to sue, as did Clough's family, which might explain this.

I wish they had shown more of the Keegan and Bremner sendings off in Clough's first match. One wonders though, why focus on this particular piece of an outstanding career. Clough went on take Nottingham Forest to win both the League Chamionship, and the European Cup, and at one point went 42 league games consecutively without defeat, which I don't think any other manager has ever done. Hope this was helpful, and think you'll enjoy the movie.",1332374400,,2199,4.994535519125683

But I've heard it better described as the game incorporating fine footwork and short passes to move the ball up the field.  I don't believe that definition describes British football in the Brian Clough era.  The british game was much more rough & tumble with long clearing kicks to move the ball downfield than teamwork between players.  Brian Clough's comment in the movie that went something like ""the beautiful game should be played beautifully"" sums up his issues with Leeds.

The movie is cracking good with keen insight into the backroom workings of professional football of that era.  Michael Sheen is brilliant, as always, and the supporting cast is marvelous as well.",1316995200,,782,5.023255813953488

3945765,5,B002LE8MP8,"Before giving us Best Picture THE KING'S SPEECH (2010), Tom Hooper made the glorious, British ""football"" biopic, THE DAMNED UNITED.

You needn't know of Leeds United, 1970's-era English football, or even manager Brian Clough to adore this film. Morgan's screenplay (based on David Peace's novel) creates a most compelling triangulation of adult male friendships and rivalries.

Clough (played to perfection by Michael Sheen) adores his dutiful right-hand man, Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall), while despising his rival Don Revie (Colm Meaney). When he takes over for Revie (who leaves Leeds to coach the English national team), Clough's on-the-field failures lead to a falling out with his friend.

UNITED is a joyride of a sports film. There is the thrill of competition and the agony of defeat, of course...made all the more so by the inner turmoil that drives the talented Clough, who is haunted by father-figures from opposite ends of the spectrum.

Sheen's performance here could have been just brash and cold, yet it is his portrayal of Clough's desperation and vulnerability that gives this film a beating heart and a loving soul.

THE DAMED UNITED is classic Tom Hooper in that way; damnable famous men resized to next-door neighbor scale.",1303689600,2,1244,5.2

Of course this didn't happen in reality, and unfortunately, on film, it's a glaring mistake! As the audience, we are sitting home like, wtf is this guy in the locker room, when his team is out there playing?

It primarily concerns the sin of pride and the glory of redemption. Timeless subjects as important today as they were 1000 years ago. I would have loved to have seen Clough's time at Nottingham Forrest in contrast to what transpires here. As an American, Brian Clough was previously unknown to me but this bio-pic tells much more than his story alone. It depicts life on aggregate.

In the process, we are left with the turmoil that results from pursuing these emotions to their fullest. We are left with failure and agony.

3945772,5,B002LE8MP8,"The Damned United looks and smells and sounds like a sports film, but it is ultimately a Shakespearean tragedy imbued with deep romance. That the tragic hero at its center, Brian Clough (Michael Sheen, brilliant), is wearing soccer shorts instead of a crown doesn't minimize the grandeur and pathos, indeed, the epic quality of his fall from grace. That the similarly epic love is between two middle-aged men likewise doesn't diminish it. This is one of the sweetest, most heart-breaking stories of hubris and, ultimately, the redemption of love we have seen in a long while. (Really!)

The setting is 1970s England, where - much as it remains today - soccer rivalries are fierce, and matches are cause for national celebration or mourning. In this heady world of winners and losers, of glamour and legends, a young, cocky manager, Brian Clough, is newly promoted to Leeds United. Leeds United was, in 1974, the top English team, and Clough has big shoes to fill - Leeds' former manager, the beloved Don Revie (Colm Meaney), has left to manage the national English team, and he leaves behind him a wake of trophies and a team of fiercely loyal players. Clough, odiously arrogant, swoops in on the very wrong foot, with complaints about Leeds' weather (""Wish I was still back in Majorca!"" he exclaims obnoxiously) and radical rules - such as that former manager Revie's name must never be mentioned - quickly alienating the players, the owners, and the fans. Clough's tenure at Leeds, indeed, was a complete failure: under him, Leeds lost games, fell to the bottom of the division, and he was quickly sacked after 44 days.

The film underpins this tale of torturous disaster with a flashback to when Brian Clough, together with his partner, Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall), managed the unknown Division II team, Derby United, to unknown heights of glory. Spurred on by insatiable ambition, as well as his hurt pride at losing to Leeds without even an acknowledgement of a handshake by Revie, Clough drags the team up from the Division II nether regions, eventually catapulting it to the top of the Division I. It is here that England begins to take notice, and Clough's ego begins to swell.

The story is beautifully told. It manages to project this classical weight of tragic flaws and doomed anti-heroes without ever becoming bogged down by it. Some sequences - such as Derby United's rematch against Leeds, as experienced privately by Clough, locked in his office - are incredibly sweeping. Indeed, it is in scenes like this - as well as the media interview Clough gives with Revie - where typically ""British"" filmmaking is used to great effect. That is, by opting for subtlety and the quiet roar, i.e. less is more, the power of these moments in Clough's life is greatly felt. Michael Sheen's acting is likewise brilliant; the look on his face when Revie, on live television, explains why he failed with Leeds was gut-wrenching.

Similarly, the love between Clough and Peter Taylor is palpable from the beginning - their shared joy, boyish tackles and Taylor's loyalty and unacknowledged importance are obvious to the viewer, if not to Clough himself. Indeed, as Clough powers ahead on - per Taylor's words, and per the usual classical drama - his doomed, misguided quest, it becomes more and more obvious how important Taylor is to Clough. There's a great scene when Taylor chastises Clough for being too ambitious, describing it like a sleeping monster that, when awoken, manages to swallow everything up - even the beautiful. The later falling out between Clough and Taylor on the sunny shores of Majorca underscores this wonderfully.

By the end of the movie, we were dying to see the two men, the ""damned united"" of Derby, finally reconciled, and the film - for all its wallowing in defeat and destruction and vengeance and tragic flaws - does have a slightly more upbeat coda. Overall, an absolute joy.

Previously I've seen him play David Frost in FROST AND NIXON and Tony Blair in THE QUEEN. Sheen is an outstanding actor and he has aced all three of these biographical roles. I'd give him five stars in the other two films because those were stories which interested me greatly.  However, for this film I can only go four stars simply because I am not a sports fan of any sort, British or American.  So although the human elements of this story appealed to me, the athletic ones didn't do much for me.  If you are a sports fan, then this will probably be a five star experience for you. Sheen really shines in capturing all the nuances of a character. At the end of the movie you see footage of the real person and it took me several glances to make sure I wasn't looking at Sheen, even though the two don't look much alike.

Michael Sheen is nothing less than brilliant in his (largely ficionalized) portrayal of the flamboyant and arrogant football manager Brian Clough.  Timothy Spall also deserves kudos for his terrific performance as Clough's right-hand man, Pete Taylor.

The Damned United is very much a traditional epic, in that we watch our protagonist (however self-destructive) go from greatness to a fall from grace, only to rise from the ashes once again.  What makes this sports story different, is that his ascent to greatness is only mentioned as a brief note after the film's conclusion, which ends on a relative down note.  So rather than your typical feel-good sports flick that ends with the team bringing home the championship, the real victory is Clough finding humility.

3945782,5,B002LE8MP8,"The Damned United is not your typical sports film. It's much more than that. It's a study of contrasting personalities. Set during the 60s and 70s, the movie details the conflict of two very different managers of rival football (soccer) clubs i.e. Brian Clough and Don Revie. Don Revie (played by Colm Meaney) is the manager of the top ranked and virtually unbeatable, Leeds United. They are the Damned United of the title. Brian Clough (played by Michael Sheen) is the very outspoken, but extremely talented manager of a second tier team, Derby County.

At the start of the film, Revie has accepted the position of manager for Team England. That leaves the position of Leeds United manager open and the job is offered to Brian Clough. The film traces Brian Clough's rise as Derby County manager and fall as Leeds. Of course, he finds much more success after his tenure at Leeds United. But, that's another movie. Most Americans might ignore a film about English football thinking the subject boring. This is not the case. It's a marvelous character study and a fantastic movie. Michael Sheen's performance as Brian Clough is absolutely riveting.  He's a very talented and versatile actor with roles as diverse as David Frost, Tony Blair and even Lucien from Underworld. I found myself fascinated by Clough's obsession with Revie. That obsession is what drives the plot. The adapted script is extremely well done by Peter Morgan. He also wrote the screenplays for Frost/Nixon and the Queen. It's an extremely literate script with sharp dialog.

One thing I will mention is that while Colm Meaney did not have as much screen time as Michael Sheen, he makes his presence felt as Revie. He's a marvelous character actor who has big shoes to fill with this role. All the characters in this film are larger than life. Now, what makes this story interesting is that you eventually learn that Brian Clough's obsession with Revie arose from a perceived slight at a match. Clough says that Revie refused to shake his hand at the end of a game. Is that what has been driving this man ? That obsession is what keeps you glued to your seat. Michael Sheen is just that good at playing Clough. He's a foul mouthed ball of energy.

And this movie isn't just about the conflict between Clough and Revie. It's also a very good portrait of the friendship between Clough and his co-manager, Peter Taylor played by Timothy Spall. These two are also contrasting personalities. Peter Taylor was Brian Clough's anchor. He kept all of Clough's eccentricities in check. He's the sensible one. They were a team and when they had a fall out, that left Clough foundering.

One small detail I found interesting was the accents of the performers. Most Americans are used to hearing the polished accents of BBC English. There's none of that here. The movie is filled with rough Northern accents that may seem jarring at first, but eventually grow on a person.

This is a movie I hope more people will watch because it really is a fascinating subject. Is it true to life ? I'm sure it's a dramatization of the facts. However, that does not detract from the movie. You expect movies to take a certain amount of poetic license. Make time to see this movie, you won't regret it.",1269129600,13,3243,4.730973451327434

I could even reel off the names of the players in Leeds United and some of the other teams, to the amazement of my American wife.
The central character is Brian Clough, the manager of lowly second division Derby County, who is brash, outspoken, brilliant but hopelessly insecure. He relies on his low-key partner Peter Taylor to keep his wilder excesses in check and make sure he says balanced. Together, they are an unbeatable team.
Just up the motorway are mighty Leeds United coached by Don Revie, a tough disciplinarian adored by his players but hated by the rest of the country because of their brutal playing style.
Clough is snubbed by Revie at their first encounter and develops an obsession to beat him. And he succeeds. Derby win the second division, gain promotion to the first and amazingly win the championship in their first season in the top flight.
Then Revie is appointed coach of the England national team and Clough gets the chance to replace him at Leeds, where he hopes to eradicate his predecessor's brutal regime and impose a more attractive style of football. Except the players don't go along -- and Clough has lost his anchor because Taylor has refused to follow him to Leeds.
After 44 days Clough is sacked -- and has to put his life back in balance.
The performances in this movie are amazing. Michael Sheen as Clough is like a reincarnation. He has that distinctive voice -- the north-eastern accent and the long drawn-out whine exactly right. Colm Meaney is Revie brought back to life.

Brian Clough, a very successful manager with an explosive personality is hired to direct the best team in England of its time, Leeds United. What the story unfolds is what takes place before and current that period.  Brian played by Michael Sheen (in a brilliant way) will shock you to know how inconceivably bigheaded and proud this man was, but in the end you realize it was just because he simply knew he was radiant.

3945786,4,B002LE8MP8,"""The Damned United"" has been adapted by Peter Morgan from David Pearce's popular novel ""The Damned Utd."", a fictionalized account of Brian Clough's controversial 44 days as manager of the Leeds United football (soccer) club in 1974. Having had great success in managing the Derby County football club from the bottom of the Second Division to the top of the First, Clough was hired to replace Leeds' outgoing coach Don Revie, who had managed the team through its golden age and was very popular with the players. But Clough was without his righthand man, assistant manager Peter Taylor, at Leeds, and he had always been outspoken against Leeds' style of play. So he came in with the wrong attitude, got off on the wrong foot, and was very publicly sacked in short order.

That much is true, but a lot of the other material in ""The Damned United"" is fiction, as is the case in Pearce's novel. Peter Morgan's screenplay shifts the emphasis to make a longstanding rivalry and perceived snub from Don Revie (Colm Meaney) into Clough's primary motivation. So the film isn't faithful to the novel either. Perhaps the most significant fiction is in Brian Clough's (Michael Sheen) relationship with Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall), who was, indeed, essential to him, but much has been fabricated. Pains seem to have been taken to write Clough's character accurately, including his use of the media, and Michael Sheen actually looks like Clough. But the same cannot be said for Peter Taylor's character, whom Timothy Spall does not resemble in appearance or manner.

""The Damned United"" shifts back and forth between Clough's successes with Derby County in the late 1960s and early 1970s and his doomed tenure at Leeds United in 1974. Clough went on to more success with Nottingham Forest, but focusing on the period 1968-1974 presents Clough's triumphs and failures and the different sides to his personality that account for both. Judging by what I've seen of interviews with former Leeds players, the film has gotten the sources of Clough's difficulties at Leeds right. Despite the dramatic license with motivations, chronologies, conversations, etc, director Tom Hooper has been impressively faithful to the football culture and facilities of the 1970s, which makes this a fine period film as well as something to see for Michael Sheen's superb performance, which captures the comic and dramatic aspects of Clough's bluster.

The DVD (Sony 2010): There are 5 featurettes, 9 deleted scenes with optional commentary by director Tom Hooper, and an audio commentary. ""Cloughisms"" (9 min, optional commentary) are 4 omitted interviews of Michael Sheen as Clough, based on real interviews.

""Remembering Brian"" (10 min) interviews former footballers about Clough's career. ""The Changing Game: Football in the Seventies"" (19 min) talks to former Leeds players and a historian about the differences between football then and now.  Recommended for viewers who don't know much about British football. The audio commentary (optional English subtitles) by director Tom Hooper, Michael Sheen, and producer Andy Harries discusses what the film left out and why, locations, recreating the `60s and'70s, the fictions, and more.

3945787,5,B002LE8MP8,"A compelling rewarding movie, destined to become a classic.

The book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Damned-Utd/dp/0571224334/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Damned Utd</a>&nbsp;which anyone should read that finds this movie interesting along with a number of others on the subject uses a lot of creative license as well but the big difference is that in this movie, Clough is basically a hero as well as being the sport icon he was in the seventies. In the book and surely there is some truth to it since Clough surely suffered from alcoholism in his life, Clough somewhat self-destructs especially in the second half of the book.

First off, we need to remember that the movie and the book ""The Damned United"" are both works of fiction, the movie loosely based on the book and the book loosely based on the truth and to go one further, there also exists an additional book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/We-Are-the-Damned-United-The-Real-Story-of-Brian-Clough-at-Leeds-United/dp/1845964454/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">We Are the Damned United: The Real Story of Brian Clough at Leeds United</a>, as indicated an indeed realistic portrayal of Clough's brief rule at Leeds United. This movie though seems to reach out at portraying much of the essence of the story of the 'Damned United' and scores points for doing so. Clough wanted a clean, talented and honest soccer game, he in fact, discouraged his players from lively 'hotdog' types of celebrations in real life as just one example of his coaching. Clough's philosophy towards the game can be analyzed in some of his famous quotes such as upon arriving at Leeds, he told the players ""You can all throw your medals in the bin because they were not won fairly"" used in the movie.

What I do enjoy in the movie is that in the book whereas some essentials might become lost or obscured was how in fact, Cloughie's success truly was in large part to his co-partnership in managment with Peter Taylor, a teammate of Clough going back to his playing days in Sunderland and/or Middlesbrough, Taylor who was a goalkeeper sounded out Clough way back then on ideas and would say things to him to give him confidence. Another famous quote by BC was his saying and yes, it is in the movie, ""I wouldn't say I was the best manager in the business. But I was in the top one."" Now, what does this mean? To me, it dawned on me that he probably means that he was ""in the top one"" in being mindful of his collaboration with Peter Taylor, the two of them as one. Events did not exactly transpire as indicated in the movie but the depiction is nonetheless, basically accurate in the 'big picture' of how things were.

The story goes on from here as books on Brian Clough are now a virtual cottage industry with even a sub-category of the ol' Leeds team as well, Leeds, traditional enemy of the Monarchy in English history as well of all things I've heard. One should probably start out with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Provided-You-Don-t-Kiss-Me-20-Years-with-Brian-Clough/dp/B0035IID6M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Provided You Don't Kiss Me: 20 Years with Brian Clough</a>&nbsp;as required reading on Clough, penned by the journalist  Duncan Hamilton who spent close to 20 years with the 'Gaffer' (manager, coach) at the Nottingham Forest club and was the William Hill sport book of the year. Questions some viewers have about this movie are answered in the books which though I have gone on about and this is the movie, the books give us an idea of whether we are seeing a truthful representation. There are also a number of videos around one can watch of the actual interviews presented in this movie. Brian Clough surely had his downside as well but for the most part, in this movie, he is a hero and it's a fair place to start studying the man. In light of the recent incident so well reported on over the past week involving the mishap with the Wales and Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey, something you might not know if you only see the movie is that in fact, around 1959, Brian Clough's brilliant career as a player came to an end as the result of his leg being broken. He does allude to his career in the movie by stating something like ""I scored 251 goals in 274 games"", a phenomenal record. His being denied a further career as a player and it coming to such a sudden end, probably added an impetus to him to coach as well as he did. Yes, he was probably ""the best manager England never had"" but being as outspoken as he was, he also enjoyed a sprite career as a TV pundit while still managing and Clough derided the then-manager for England, Sir Alf Ramsey, criticisms Clough later felt some regrets over making when England were eventually eliminated from making the 1974 World Cup and Sir Alf Ramsey was dismissed. That's why that although Clough is a coaching legend and often highly likeable, there's definitely 2 sides to the story and at times, he could be a polarizing figure, as reflected also during his tenure at Leeds and as the reason for his departure from Derby County and not being selected as manager for the England team. Sir Alf Ramsey by the way, was in charge of England's triumph in 1966. Still, polarizing or not, to be a manager anywhere, you are bound to encounter difficulties, if it be in Bob Bradley's position with the USA National soccer team or any other.

Of course, anyone who sees the movie 'Queen' is probably struck by Michael Sheen's close resemblance to Tony Blair, so I was skeptical at first on how well he could do Brian Clough. After reading about Clough in a number of books and magazines and watching actual video footage of the man, Sheen does in fact, do a convincing job. The cinematography additionally is quite fantastic in this movie. ""Goal"", ""A shot at glory"" and ""(Escape to) Victory"" may have a bit more soccer action but this movie has the action combined with the managerial duties of Taylor and Clough and that makes this a real winner.

The extra features are outstanding and tell one a lot more about this movie including a segment giving a contrarian view of Leeds United versus being the 'dirty team' that they are portrayed to be in the view of Brian Clough. It is worth evaluating to be even-handed in viewing these past events because, yes, this is a point of debate even until today. I'd give it additional high marks for authenticity, the special features point out the stadium used in the movie is from Chesterfield who still retain the same old time stadium with terraces at least for now, add in a pouring rain at some of the matches as one can still see at a number of Premier League games being played nowadays and the setting is very realistic. The only thing I wonder about is if the gold of the Derby County Team would have seen their original stadium painted in the green color scheme (the name of the original stadium the Derby County Rams played in was called of all the things, the Baseball Grounds).

We see so many movies where songs from that period are added on to add to the feel of the time. Interestingly, the producers pulled out Deep Purple's 'flight of the rat' and it actually works exceedingly well in a 'soccer' movie, I had to listen to it again a few times. The whole soundtrack is good but I'm not sure if it has come out on CD.",1267833600,3,7401,4.849683544303797
3945788,5,B002LE8MP8,"""The Damned United"" has turned out to be an impulse buy that is paying me back dividends. Michael Sheen plays Derby county/ Leeds United manager Brian Clough, A straight talking egotistical man who, along with this partner Perter Taylor(Timothy Spall), had an uncanny talent for taking sub par teams and turning them into champions. The film bounces around his time line by telling how he became a successful coach by leading Derby County, took over the reins of Leeds United from his arch enemy Don Revey(Clom Meaney)and eventually failed and fell into disgrace. Michael Sheen really shines in his roll as Clough and it was a joy to see him return to a roll that seems tailor suited for him. He had a bad run with this rolls in those lame Vampire/Werewolf flicks. He and Spall are the glue that hold the film together and had great chemistry. I didn't know about Clough's story before I watched this film and it's a truly remarkable one. What he did was like talking the Detroit Lions and making them Super Bowl champions. A virtually impossible task. Clough was one of those iconic ""love him or hate him"" type of characters that pop up in sports every once in a while. I liked him right away and his cocky way of telling his bosses off, keeping his players in line and his consuming hatred for that bloody Don Revey are a true joy to witness.

3945789,5,B002LE8MP8,"This is a brilliantly filmed, original movie. Based on David Peace's spare, gritty novel, it brings alive the ill fated 44 day managership of Brian Clough at Leeds United, explaining why he was such a controversial choice to manage the club given the long acrimonious history between Leeds and Derby when Don Revie was the manager of football's champions Leeds and Clough was at the helm of young pretenders Derby.

Michael Sheen shows off his brilliant skills in conveying real life characters (he has given similar treatment to Tony Blair, David Frost and Kenneth Williams); and recreates Brian Clough in his own image, a slightly camp, antagonistic manager frequently undermining his own chairman.

The filming recreates many of the tropes of the 1970s - ashtrays laid out with half time oranges in the dressing room, Wizard boys comics, psychedelic wallpaper - and makes the film a hugely enjoyable piece of ersatz period drama.",1261785600,7,932,5.084967320261438
3945790,4,B002LE8MP8,"A few months ago when I was overseas I heard about this movie, based on a true story about controversial soccer manager Brian Clough.

A few days ago, I went to see the movie, in San Francisco.  I wondered what other people in the theater might think, if they would get it.

Sure enough, non soccer followers, who probably  had no clue about Clough or Revie were sucked into the drama of the legendary confrontation, between these two rivals, which surpassed my expectations.

Someone more outpoken and more controversial than Brian Clough would be difficult to imagine, someone destined to become one of the most outstanding managers in the history of English soccer.  Don Revie managed League Champions Leeds United.  Clough managed Derby County previous years League Champions.  Don Revie leaves Leeds to manage England, and Leeds made the bonehead decision to appoint the outspoken Clough in his place, outspoken because of his criticism and dislike of both Revie and the style of play under his management.  This outspokenness led to clashes with the players whose successful, although rough style, had led them to incredible success.

As you get further into the movie, I suspect you will get drawn into its surprising twists and turns.

I was particularly impressed with Colm Meaney's portrayal of Revie.  At one point I wondered if was actually Revie or Meaney I was watching, if it was actual footage of Revie.  Michael Sheen who played Prime Minister Tony Blair in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Queen/dp/B00005JPAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Queen</a>, nails Clough's distinct accent and outspokenness to a tee.  Some of these Leeds players were greats, but the character development is very thin here.  I understand that some of these players threatened to sue, as did Clough's family, which might explain this.

I wish they had shown more of the Keegan and Bremner sendings off in Clough's first match. One wonders though, why focus on this particular piece of an outstanding career. Clough went on take Nottingham Forest to win both the League Chamionship,  and the European Cup, and at one point went 42 league games consecutively without defeat, which I don't think any other manager has ever done. Hope this was helpful, and think you'll enjoy the movie.",1257552000,22,2323,5.269021739130435
8372526,5,B002LE8MP8,"A real fun and uplifting movie to watch, even if you don't know much /care about soccer! The plot is centralized around the true friendship between two main characters: what it looks like in real life (this is based on a true story), what it takes to have one, and what it takes to win it back if one loses it. (Side Note: As Michael Sheen reminds me and my husband strongly of a friend we know, it triples the fun of watching the movie!)",1514246400,,438,4.1647058823529415
8372527,4,B002LE8MP8,"Football non-American style remains one of the best team sports to watch, partly because of its intensive working class roots and the local amateur clubs on which it's based.  But I'm not a die-hard fan.  I don't follow any club and had never heard of Brian Clough.  So when I say that this movie is worth watching for all the reasons a good movie is always worth watching - from screenplay to acting to direction - I hope you'll watch it yourself and agree: it's a fine development of the political dimension of all interpersonal relations.  Michael Sheen beautifully renders a difficult personality, used to winning by bully tactics, beginning to recognize how essential others are to his own success; Timothy Spall delivers an outstanding performance as Clough's assistant manager (the ""goods in the back""); and Colm Meaney gives us the complex rival who excels at  strategy but eventually fails by way of tactics.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Damned-United/dp/B003BB2LUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Damned United</a>",1509580800,,1073,5.723270440251572

8372530,5,B002LE8MP8,"I think this is the best footballing film I have ever seen. The acting is brilliant, and Michael Sheen's take on Cloughie is superb. So far as I can remember, the plot is true to the events that happened. The thing that really stunned me, considering that I can recall these times, is just how brutal football was in those days. The film is interspersed with clips from some of the actual games, perhaps most notably the Charity Shield game between Leeds and Liverpool. Seeing how brutal football could be then, you wonder how it could have produced players with the skills of Stan Bowles, Kevin Keegan and others, not to mention George Best.",1498003200,,642,4.640350877192983

Clough was such a larger than life character in real life - the Ali mouth of English soccer and, like Ali he could back up the comments with results. But this movie goes beyond a documentary exposing the complexities of Clough's character. It shows the humanity and frailty of his emotions whether it's risking everything in challenging his nemesis or realizing, almost too late, how the beautiful game requires a team not just an individual
Highly recommended.",1481414400,,565,4.895833333333333

Michael Sheen and Timothy Spall shine as best friends and fellow coaches. And you will love to hate Colm Meaney",1474588800,,263,4.717391304347826
