7904913,5,B000006QJD,"I have a real interest in the Romanov family and their end. This DVD is a bit misleading in its title. There is more spent on Anna Anderson then on Anastasia herself which I think makes the title a bit misleading. But it is very good to watch if you are doing about the fall of the Romanovs and the rise of Lenin as gives a good insight to it.
Overall I thought it was very good and I think that anyone who likes or is interested in the Romonavs or Anastasia will enjoy it",1291420800,,472,3.9789473684210526
7904914,5,B000006QJD,"I have been very intersting in the Romanoffs since I read Nicholas and Alexandra.  Their sad story really touched me and turned me into a Romanoff Buff.  I still think that Anna Anderson was Anastasia and the DNA was fudged,but that is another tale. The story of the Grand Duchess was well made on the DVD.",1273968000,,306,4.446428571428571
7904915,5,B000006QJD,"""Anastasia"" was a gift for my granddaughter who absolutely loved the DVD. ""Anastasia"" puts a human face on a very inhuman era of Russian history.",1269129600,,145,4.84
7904916,3,B000006QJD,"$22 for a 50-minute documentary from A&E is unreasonable...it certainly isn't worth $15, much less $25...  If you buy the movie Anastasia (1956) with Ingrid Bergman  (for $11.99) you get this documentary for free in the special features, plus a decent movie.

Why the documentary television networks think they need to overprice their stuff above the cost of full length feature-film DVDs is beyond me, but until they learn, do yourself a favor and buy this video as part of the Anastasia movie DVD.

Like the other commenters have said, this documentary is less on Anastasia Romanov and more on the controversy of Anna Anderson and the controversy.",1265500800,,649,4.981481481481482
7904917,5,B000006QJD,"I found this biography very interesting.  One of the main reasons for this was that the story of Anna Anderson was put forward from an American, and not solely a Russian or European perspective.  By this I mean that it wasn't troubled with the European slant, i.e. the hidden agenda of both parties on either side of the argument.  However, I would urge any interested viewer not to stop their research with this biography alone.  I found many interesting articles on the internet based on the arguments discussed in this biography.  If there was one flaw, it was the attempt to close the case based on the DNA evidance alone. In my opinion, the mystery which they claimed to solve, seemed only to deepend on further examination. I felt the story leaned towards a definite conclusion, whereas further research myself showed that this is far from the case.  All in all, it is an excellent production, the only flaw for me being that the production guided the viewer towards a particularly conclusion. Having said that, it's a great addition to any video library.",1162512000,6,1061,4.770491803278689
7904918,3,B000006QJD,"The young female who was really Anastasia is dead one-third of the way into this documentary.  What follows is how she inspired a film and a cartoon and how her controversy lives on.  I also learned that her last name is pronounced ro-MAN-ov, not RO-man-ov.

This film discusses similarities between the real and alleged Anastasia, but it never asserts where the two were the same or not.  This leads me to believe that they want viewers to come to their own conclusions and that the jury may still be out.

Still, the documentary suggests that ""Anastasia's mystery lives on because her life seemed like such a fairy tale.""  Leave it to A&E's Biography to water down things.  Maybe people want Anastasia to have lived because she may have fought Lenin and his progeny.  Maybe people want her to be alive due to anti-Communist sentiments.  This documentary, like many in the series, dances around or directly avoids leftist matters.

This was the first time in the Biography series that a woman was covered yet no other women are interviewed about her.  All the interviewees were male, for no explained reason.",1154736000,8,1109,4.814814814814815
7904919,4,B000006QJD,"People are making commentaries that this is the ANIMATED MOVIE put out by 20th Century Fox.  This is actually a biography on the youngest grand duchess, about her pretenders and her actual short life of barely 17 years.",1015372800,4,219,4.7631578947368425
