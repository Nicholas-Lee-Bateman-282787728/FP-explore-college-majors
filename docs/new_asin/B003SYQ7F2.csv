4189864,2,B003SYQ7F2,You can't duplicate what once was. I remember seeing stomp the yard at the movies and was blown away. Did not get the same feeling with this one. The lead Chance I don't feel he was right for that part the casting seems off. The talent was ok. Even with the return of DJ didn't do it for me it seemed forced. I appreciate the effort of part 2 but now i see why it was release on DVD. Not even the ending performance was good or impressive. Again can't duplicate what once was it's rear when you can duplicate and get the reaction you did the first time around.,1285286400,7,560,4.1
4189865,3,B003SYQ7F2,"In 2007, ""Stomp the Yard""  took America by storm by showcasing life of college students from a Black university who are part of a Greek fraternity and how many of these frats and sororities compete against each other in Stepping competitions.  The first film featured Columbus Short as the character DJ Williams, pop star Ne-Yo and helped establish pop star Chris Brown as an actor.

The film which was budgeted for $13 million, went on to make $75 million in the box office and was a major success.

A new sequel (via direct-to-video) was created in 2010 titled ""Stomp the Yard: Homecoming"" and is directed by Rob Hardy (""The Gospel"", ""Trois"" and worked on episodes of ""Criminal Minds"" and ""Heroes: The Recruit""), who co-produced the first film with Will Packer (who returns as producer for the sequel) and a screenplay by Albert Leon (""Feel the Noise"") and Meena Payne.

""Stomp the Yard: Homecoming"" focuses on dancer Chance Harris (played by Collins Pennie, ""HawthoRNe"", ""Fame"", ""Prom Night"") who has lost a major street dance competition and because he was dealing with a group of thugs (who had bet against him and winning), the thugs want to exploit Chance and make him think that he owes them $5,000.  Unfortunately, Chance doesn't have the money and during a shootout, Chance manages to escape the thugs but because they know he's in the area, the thugs will be on his tail.

We then get to see how Chance's life is in the meantime.  Chance returns back to his home in Atlanta (after leaving for awhile after his mother died) and now due to family obligation, Chance works at his father's (played by Keith David, ""Death at a Funeral"", ""Chronicles of Riddick"", ""Spawn"") Crispy Catfish restaurant, while attending Truth University in Atlanta and is a member of the fraternity Theta Nu Theta.

Chance's father thinks his son's dedication to the fraternity is a waste of time and wants his son to take responsibility.  His father feels that he did so much for him, that while Chance is now back home...the least he can do is help him out at the store and show that he can take on responsibility.  But with the next Stepping competition coming up at school, Chance's Theta brothers are expecting nothing but the best from their members and also hoping they can win this year against their rivals, the Mu Gamma Xi.

Meanwhile, Chance is dating a stepper and sorority member Nikki (played by Tika Sumpter, ""One Life To Live"") and she knows that Chance has a major rivalry with Mu Gamma Xi leader Taz (played by Stephen ""Twitch"" Boss, ""So You Think You Can Dance?) because his ex-girlfriend Brenda (played by The Cheetah Girls Kiely Williams) left him and is now dating Taz.

But Taz and the Mu Gamma Xi love to get under the Theta's skin, especially as the current champions of previous stepping competitions at school.  But no matter how Taz tries to tick the Theta's off,  Theta leader Dane (played by Pooch Hall) tries to keep things cool within the Theta's and make sure they don't get involved in any trouble.  If anything, he tries to remind his fellow Theta's that they are family and they think and work as a family not as individuals.

The only problem is Chance has a hot temper and doesn't like to be dissed by anyone including Taz and the Mu's and thus, tends to walk on the beat of his own drum.  But he knows, the only way to show them up is by winning the Step competition but their current routine is old.

Chance wants to win the Step Up competition because it guarantees him winning $5,000 and a scholarship and knows that their current Step Up routine is not good enough to beat the Mu's, so he comes up with an innovative dance routine for his brothers that he hopes will beat their rivals in competition.

But with his increasing friction with his father who is demanding for Chance to become more responsible and to be there for him at the restaurant (especially during homecoming), Chance finds his life spiraling downhill when the thugs who are wanting their money end up beating up his childhood friend and brothers at the fraternity.  Life becomes more problematic for Chance and when he starts thinking for himself instead of his brothers, he starts to distance himself away from them including his girlfriend.

With Chance facing more problems in his life, will he ever be able to recover?

VIDEO:

""Stomp the Yard: Homecoming"" is presented in 1:78:1 Anamorphic Widescreen.  Director Rob Hardy did a great job in working with a large number of people (especially the volunteers for the crowds who participated for long hours for the making of this film). Cinematographer Maz Makani did a great job in filming the dance battles, stepping battles, the dance training but working with a large crowd.  Some scenes seem as if they were handheld and there are some unbalanced shots with shaking but by no means did I feel it was anything majorly distracting.  I also have to give Paul Millspaugh some props of taking a lot of the dance footage and taking many cuts, editing those scenes and making the battles feel realistic and definitely bringing energy to the film.  Picture quality for the DVD was good, I didn't see any major compression artifacts on the DVD release or any major video anomalies.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Stomp the Yard: Homecoming"" is presented in English and French 5.1 Dolby Digital.  For the most part, this is a dialogue-driven film that has a pretty cool soundtrack.  In a film like this, you're not going to get much surround usage since there aren't any major action sequences (with the exception of a fight and tables and chairs being knocked over) but you do get crowd ambiance and if anything, it's music that tends to utilize the bass.  For the most part, dialogue is clear and understandable.

Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Stomp the Yard: Homecoming"" comes with the following special features:

  * Commentary with Director Rob Hardy, Producer Will Packer, Collins Pennie and Stephen ""tWitch"" Boss - (12:30) A hilarious commentary  as Rob Hardy breaks the film down and how certain scenes were shot, Will Packer brings some humor to the commentary scenes and good in-depth background info. from the dancing portions of the film to the acting by Collins Pennie (Chance) and Stephen ""tWitch"" Boss (Taz).  Interesting commentary in regards to Collins Pennie's kissing scene.
  * Deleted Scenes- (11:11) A total of eight deleted scenes.  Overall, good cuts were made for pacing purposes and focuses a lot on the diner scenes featuring Collins Pennie and Keith David, Jasmine Guy.
  * Stomp the Yard: Choreography - (10:13) A featurette on the choreography  of ""Stomp the Yard: Homecoming"" and taking stepping into the next level.  Featuring choreographer Chuck Maldonado training the cast with their routine and director Rob Hardy, Producer Will Packer and the cast talk about the choreography of the film.
  * Previews - Trailers for upcoming Sony Pictures Home Entertainment titles.

JUDGMENT CALL:

In the tradition of the original ""Stomp the Yard"", I enjoyed the sequel.  It keeps the theme going between the rivalry between the Theta's and the Mu's and features new students facing problems in their personal life and needing to get things together with themselves, especially at college and their obligations to their fraternity.

It's kind of hard for a sequel, especially for ""Stomp the Yard: Homecoming"" when the original had star power with two major pop stars Ne-Yo and Chris Brown involved with the project but if anything, what I enjoyed about this film is that director Rob Hardy and producer Will Packer know how life is in the fraternity and are able to really fine-tune the character of Chance Harris but also not bring the story down by introducing anything that is too unrealistic.  They keep the story real and most of all, trying to incorporate something new, innovative into the world of Step dancing through this film.

The first film was wonderful when it came to choreography but this time around, they really brought an even more physical and intense style of choreography to the routines and the fact that these guys had to learn within two weeks and nail it down, was pretty cool.

For the most part, Collins Pennie does a good job in playing the character of Chance Harris and also to see him and Keith David interact with each other onscreen.  ""Stomp the Yard: Homecoming"" also features a cameo by the first film's main character DJ Williams (played by Columbus Short) who comes to give encouragement to his Theta brothers and also stars Jasmine Guy (""A Different World"") as Janice, an employee at the Harris restaurant.  You also get Stephen ""Twitch"" Boss (for those who enjoyed his dancing in ""So You Think You Can Dance?""), playing the character Taz,  ""One Life to Live"" actress Tika Sumpter playing Chance's current girlfriend, Nikki and Cheetah Girls member Kiely Williams playing Chance's ex girlfriend Brenda.

As for the DVD, you get a few special features with a hilarious and really cool audio commentary, deleted scenes and also learning how much work went into the talent learning how to prepare for their dance scenes for the film.  Choreographer Chuck Maldonado did a very good job in training them and also bringing something new (and challenging) to step dancing.

Overall, ""Stomp the Yard: Homecoming"" is a film that stays true to the roots of the original film.  It's an enjoyable story, with solid performances by the cast and I enjoy the choreography for this film as well. The film plays it safe with its storyline and although there is a fight scene, there are no deaths or any repeat of what happened in the last film.  And it's probably a good thing of not having to repeat the same kind of tragedy for this sequel.  If anything, I liked how the story focused on Chance having to deal with his obligations to his father and the restaurant, being a good boyfriend for Nikki and most of all, having his brothers at the frat depending on him to get them ready for the competition and to add that there are a group of thugs who wouldn't hesitate killing him if Chance doesn't produce the money.

""Stomp the Yard: Homecoming"" features a good balance of drama and dance and if anything, fans of the original film should find this sequel enjoyable.",1285286400,5,10307,4.798980747451869

It is the same story line, the same beginning. It's almost like the Karate Kid part 2/Breakin'. The same moves,same lines everything. I don't even know when Columbus Short comes in the picture because we skipped through the entire movie till the end. And even that was just ""OKAY"". I promise you, this is movie sucked big time.

4189892,3,B003SYQ7F2,"I purchased this for my wife an I, as I did not know they made a second movie in the series.  I was kind of excited that ""Twitch"" (Stephen Boss) was in the film.

The actual movie was alright but pretty underwhelming overall.  They had some great dancers in the movie but it seemed as though there was very little feature of the skill that those dancers have and what they can actually accomplish.  The ""Battles"" where not really anywhere near the level that I perceived on the original movie.  I wish they would have either let the dancers have more freedom with some of their moves, or if that was the freedom that they gave them then maybe I was wishing for more/better choreography.  The overall story-line was not as captivating as the last one was, and I did not get immersed or engrossed in the story line and did not feel any connection to it.  It seemed to be a very shallow story-line that was more focused on the sub par dancing that happened in the movie, instead of building both collectively.  Overall just okay or just under okay.",1365724800,,1045,4.43455497382199

4189896,5,B003SYQ7F2,"Well i must say this was ok still I really expected a little more than a flash back from the first Stomp the Yard.  Typical plot about relationships at school, frat life.

4189899,2,B003SYQ7F2,"You won't find incredible scenes here because they're all chopped to chit in the editing room.  The story is predictable and banal but I did like how the guys, even the one's from a different frat, stood up for each other to the gangstas.  This movie would have improved by one star if we only could have seen the main character's father, played by the imposing Keith David, kick the crappeezee out of the main hood.  Otherwise, derivative.  Watch the first one or any number of other dance-off type movies.",1347235200,,507,4.6

It wasn't true to life. It was awful to me. I gave this DVD to my elder brother. So that's why I'm not giving this a very good view. Certainly after watching it, it wasn't something I wanted to see again and again. But this is my opinion.

Why was the plot the same? And the lead was lame..Its been a long time since I've really been disappointed in a film but this one did it for sure. The first Stomp the Yard set the bar too high. They shouldn't have released this at all. I watched the movie online for free, and I want to warn others don't dare spend ANY money to rent this, and don't even bother using your time to watch it..because that's an hour of your life you can't get back.

Pooch Hall did his thing, and Teyana Taylor did a nice job too, but a few good performers couldn't save this sinking ship of a movie. I wish I had an extra pair of hands just so I could give it four thumbs down.",1309132800,,839,4.2375

4189915,4,B003SYQ7F2,"I guess this is one of the few reviews from a pure perspective since I never saw the 1st Stomp the Yard. I just wasn't interested because Darren from ""Darren's Dance Move's"" fame was in his 40's and I just thought a lot of the cast did not look college age and was not believable.

I picked this up because the cast was younger and looked more believable. I really liked the dancing of everyone else besides the main character. The thing is the Collins Pennie can dance really well in real life, but the way they cut the moves and slowed them down and sped up certain moves really did not work for his style of dance & it made him look wack.

The girlfriend was pretty, but the lines they gave her felt contrived and that made it pretty wack and unbelievable. I rented this and will be buying it because of Stephen ""tWitch"" Boss and I was really inspired by their passion as actors and dancers. I also liked the story line and the main characters development from a selfish young man to somebody who began to take responsibility for his actions. Hopefully I don't regret this review after I see the 1st Stomp the Yard- I don't think I will(I'm renting the 1st one tonight) but even so, nothing can beat the Gamma's last performance (the 1 performance of the movie that bumped the rating from 3 to 4 stars), I don't care what anybody says!!!!!!!",1290988800,,1344,4.372

4189920,1,B003SYQ7F2,"Unfortunately, I prepurchased this DVD thinking it would at least have some great dance scenes.  I knew it would not be as great as the first one.  The dancing could have been done by any teenager walking down the street.  I did love Twitch in this movie and I wish he could have appeared in a better written movie.  The story was like a weak, copycat version of the first one.  The main character was not charismatic and he had too many issues that did not get resolved at the end of the movie.  This movie could have gotten at least three stars from me if Columbus Short had at least danced for a minute to show them how it shoud be done.  He was the only bright spot in the entire movie.  Whoever did the casting must have been inexperienced.  Anyway, the movie was TERRIBLE-TERRIBLE-TERRIBLE!!!!!  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND WAIT UNTIL IT COMES ON TELEVISION FOR FREE AND MAYBE SAVE YOURSELF AND DON'T WATCH IT THEN.  AWWWWWWWFUL!!!!!!",1287360000,,932,4.488095238095238
4189921,2,B003SYQ7F2,"No need for a long review here. Every dance movie I've seen so far has had a juvenile plot, and this one is no exception. To make matters worse, this style of dancing (stepping) does almost nothing for me. Last but not least, the movie  doesn't cast historically black colleges in a favorable light either. The only reason I'm not giving this movie one star is that I can still imagine that it could be even worse. Nevertheless, I can't recommend this movie for any purpose.",1286755200,,474,4.511627906976744
4189922,1,B003SYQ7F2,"There is nothing like wasting your money on a rental. Thank the Lord I did not purchase this DVD because it was horrible. I just finished watching Stomp the Yard II. Unfortunately, I can only rate this movie with 1-star, if I could give it a lower rating, I would. The dancing was pathetic, the acting was weak.... I could not connect with any of the characters it was just blah! I loved seeing Stephen Boss - Twitch (so you think you can dance) and Columbus Short, however it was not enough to make this movie good! Without a doubt the first movie was so much better. In the first movie the acting, dancing and story-line was really good. I like to support black movies and I am not sure who the writer, director and producer was on this movie. But clearly they need to go back to the drawing board. Huge flop!",1286755200,,811,4.30718954248366
4189923,4,B003SYQ7F2,"I liked this movie. I didn't think I would since it was straight to DVD, but I thought it was a good movie. I only watched it because of Columbus Short. He isn't in very many scenes. My only complaints are that the movie was somewhat predictable, it wasn't long enough and would love to see more of what happened between the main character and those women.",1286668800,,356,4.3283582089552235

4189925,1,B003SYQ7F2,"I was very disappointed.  The story was very weak, I would have like to see more actors & actresses from the first one return.  After all, the title was ""homecoming""...It's definitely not as good as the first one.  Don't rent or buy, keep the memories of the first one!!!",1285545600,5,271,4.489795918367347
4189926,1,B003SYQ7F2,This was a waste of money! Columbus short was in the last 15 minutes. The story line is the same except it is just horrible and corney. A waste of money and time! The dance steps are simple and lack creativy. It's like watching a bootleg version of the original. I am soooo disappointed.,1285372800,5,287,4.333333333333333
