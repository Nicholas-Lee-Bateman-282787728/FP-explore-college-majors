7901021,3,8379453700,I loved the first movie...Lity do M2 was not the same as the first one. It could recreate the magic of the previous story lines. Perhaps they tried to hard to replicate the first product. Still a fan but won't be watching this movie over and over like the first in the series.,1474761600,,276,4.226415094339623
