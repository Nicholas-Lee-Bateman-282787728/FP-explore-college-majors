2897297,3,B000TGCRC4,"On a lovely day in Hampstead Heath, seven couples explore their relationships, find love, break up, and come to a crossroads. Most of the seven stories are not intertwined, except for a few parting glances here or there, and one man who is desperately looking to couple up with a woman for the day.

The good: I loved the story between Pete and Sara, who I thought were a lovely as husband and wife, and then realized that they were there to share the joint custody of their child, each clutching their divorce papers in hand. It appears that they still love each other, but something is not...right.

I also enjoyed the scenes between Brian and Billy (played by Ewan McGregor) a couple who are grappling with the decision to adopt a child, when Billy is having a hard time growing up.

Ludo and Esther also gave good performances. If I hadn't read the blurb on the back of the DVD cover, I would have thought that this duo had been together for years and very happy, but this one had a little shock and surprise at the end.

The bad: Eddie and Iris's story had captured me at first. Two old friends meeting 40-50 years later, on the same bench they frequented when they were 17, as they were once in love. Something lost me in the middle when it could have been very romantic.

Molly and Jamie were featured in the first story, a happily married unit, whose relaxing day is ruined when Jamie spends a little too much time staring a French girl, whose underwear is showing. He then makes up this convoluted story about how he once read the same book she's reading and tells his wife what it's about, etc. She then sees through the falsehood, then goes to the French girl to catch her husband in a lie. I guess it could have been a good story, but something felt a little too contrived about it.

The story with Julia and Gerry starts out well as a couple on a clumsy and awkward blind date. As they misunderstand each other less, and start to like each other more, one silly glance at someone else, sends the other into a flurry. It just didn't seem finished and it was a little too abrupt.

The strange: Anna and Noel meet after she's had a fight with her boyfriend, and they break up. What occurs then is a back and forth conversation about what is going to happen next. One of them seems crazy, and the other desperate.

As in many movies or books that have several different stories with many characters, you can't always expect to connect with all of them. Unfortunately, the number that I connected with was smaller than those that I did. This would be a good film to watch if you do not need a lot of action, but want to be reminded of the interconnectedness of people, and view all of their idiosyncracies. Also, you can never go wrong with London.",1228003200,7,2756,4.390196078431373
2897298,4,B000TGCRC4,"An enjoyable, thought-provoking set of stories that flow at a brisk pace, ""Scenes of a Sexual Nature"" sports a nifty set of windowpanes to the human condition, in particular what drives romantic relationships.

Set entirely within London's pristine Hampstead Heath, a vast, pristine forest and parkland, this edgy collaboration between first-time writer Aschlin Ditta and producer/director Ed Blum has a distinct, raw flavor. With above-average actors and Ditta's candid dialogue, the film feels consistently fresh and rarely forced with a wry, witty classical soundtrack by Dominik Scherrer to underscore the proceedings.

An accent or two sounds a little shaky, and the PC card may be pushed a tad too self-consciously (three mixed-race and one gay couple are involved), but this pays no ultimate disserve to the film's overall effect. Whether it is an awkward blind date, the prospect of adoption or a newly divorced couple happy to be simply acquaintances, each situation is treated with equal attention, poetically weaving into the next. Some elements veer toward the unrealistic (the divorced couple walking in arm in arm, for one), providing only a minor drawback.

The most enjoyable pairing is that of illustrious actors Benjamin Whitrow and Eileen Akins as a long-separated couple reunited by chance, both with the same bench, with its glorious view of the London skyline, as their destination. Since 50 years have passed since lighter days when they were 17, both initially fail to recognize each other but soon gasp in wonderment. Both married and loved their partners, but always wondered what became of each other. Together, they scale the rolling hill off in the distance, something they've both longed for but never attempted.

""After finally climbing this infernal hill after all those years of thinking about it, what you're saying is, `the view is better from where we were?'"" she asks him once they've reached the top.

""Well, on reflection, yes,"" he replies.

""I think you're right,"" she agrees.  It may not be as high, but it did seem clearer.""

Moments like these give the film a lyrical panache. Similar impact occurs when Billy, the philandering half of a gay couple played by Ewan McGregor, vows to change his ways should his partner Brian, played by Douglas Hodge, consent to adopt.

""There's still a problem,"" says Brian, clearly desperate for Billy's commitment. ""I don't want kids. I just want you.""

Mark Strong and Polly Walker also resonate deeply as a couple with an unconventional means of attraction, as do Hugh Bonneville and Gina McKee as a socially inept duo set up on a date by a mutual friend. Oscar-nominee Sophie Okonedo also shines in her brief but colorful part as a young woman with unbelievable mood swings who hands her pursuer, played by Tom Hardy, more than he bargained for.

An ideal date film, atypical in that it can speak equally to both men and women, ""Scenes From a Sexual Nature"" is a picturesque, stimulating flick as well as the cinematic debut of a screenwriting talent with loads of potential.",1209600000,3,3055,5.0536779324055665
2897299,5,B000TGCRC4,"The British have done it again - successfully shown how talent, ensemble attitude, prudent production values, and esprit de corps can result in a first class thoughtful comedy of life.  A first outing for writer Aschlin Ditta and director Ed Blum, this entertaining, intelligent and beautifully wrought film is a veritable showcase of some of Britain's finest actors.

The concept is a simple one: one sunny afternoon on Hampstead Heath overlooking London the camera moves among seven couples acting out the sexual overtones of relationships.  No, there is no graphic action here: it is absolutely unnecessary, so candid and intelligent is the script.  The couples we meet are 1) Eileen Atkins and Benjamin Whitrow, two alone, aging characters whose proclivity for weekly visits to the same bench result in a courtship dance of sorts; 2) Andrew Lincoln and Holly Aird discussing their rather dry state of marriage as Andrew's eyes understandably caress the beautiful Eglantine Rembauville-Nicolle reading Camus nearby, causing a crack in the couple's marriage; 3) Sophie Okenedo distraught at a breakup is consoled then seduced by flippant Tom Hardy; 4) Adrian Lester and Catherine Tate are in the final paper stages of divorce, trying to overcome their feelings for their frolicking little daughter; 5) Ewan McGregor and Douglas Hodge are a gay couple contemplating adoption despite McGregor's character's wandering eye; 6) Hugh Bonneville and Catherine Tate banter the fragility of a first date over lunch and wine and distrust; and Polly Walker 'sells' her time and attentions to willing buyer Mark Strong.

The phrase on the cover of the very well made DVD states it well: 'Sex and love. Some seek it, some need it, some spurn it and some pay for it, but we're all involved in it'. In addition to the pleasure of watching these superb actors ply  their trade in these small vignettes the cinematography, editing, and musical score underline the spontaneous feeling of Ditta and Blum's concept.  It is a pure joy to watch - even the informative dialog in the added features that accompany this delightful DVD.  Grady Harp, January 08",1200614400,7,2136,5.117816091954023
2897300,2,B000TGCRC4,It has its moments but it's more suitable to be a TV show that is one hour long. Some of the dialogues are humourous and witty. It's obvious some scenes were dragged to make the movie 90 minutes long.,1196899200,5,200,4.153846153846154

2897305,2,B000TGCRC4,"To tell you the truth, I was not a big fan of this movie. It was really slow and I ended up fast forwarding through most of it. Only bought it for a few dollars, but ended up giving it to a used movie store after I'd watched it. Not worth more than a few dollars, but that's up to you.",1362441600,,285,3.6885245901639343

2897308,3,B000TGCRC4,"Certain scenes are good, and certain scenes could have been cut out. I would probably watch this movie again because there are some interesting lines (here and there). There wasn't a problem with the acting. OFr the most part, the actors did great. However, the story lines were just not that interesting in some cases. Most people have seen films like this by now where viewers are looking in on different people revolving around the same theme, and I just think that I have seen this type of movie done better.

If anyone has read some of my other reviews, then they would know that I working my way through Tom Hardy's films. I thought that he was hilarious as Noel when I could hear him.",1317600000,2,691,4.484126984126984
2897309,5,B000TGCRC4,"Shame on the reviewer for not writing Spoiler Alert in one review! Most others are solid critique.
I am only adding this bit because I have seen the film twice and now find I want it in my collection. In the second viewing I found subtlties I missed on first viewing. I appreciated the depth of the characters. I noted that the ""strange"" exchange between Anna and Noel was made much more comprehensible when I  figured out the final scene, which is run through the credits, so don't turn it off too soon! Tom Hardy -- does he do anything poorly? -- and his canine pal made me burst out laughing.
I loved the way the vignettes are unpredictable -- and unforgettable. This is a delightful film appreciable on many levels. Got to have it in my collection. BTW, does anyone know if the film earned any awards?",1248048000,4,805,4.4391891891891895
