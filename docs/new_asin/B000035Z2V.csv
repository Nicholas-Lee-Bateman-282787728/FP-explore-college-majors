1258632,2,B000035Z2V,"I gave this movie a look mostly out of nostalgic memories of Saturday  mornings including the likes of Bugs Bunny, Rocky and Bullwinkle, and, yes,  Dudley Do-Right and crew.
I have to admit that I didn't have high  expectations going into the viewing, but even my low expectations were not  met.  Fraser, who I thought did a passable job as ""George of the  Jungle,"" didn't come across as a very good Dudley for me.  It's like  he never hit his character's stride during the entire movie.
I wonder if  Fraser watched Dudley Do-Right cartoons as a kid.  They were highly  melodramatic, but this movie didn't even reach the low plateau of a formula  melodrama.  Dudley's character was not appropriately naive and likeable, he  came across instead as simple, even idiotic.  I was also disappointed in  that the setting for the movie was much more modern than Dudley's cartoons  were.  In addition, the villain was not especially villianous, he was,  rather just greedy and slimy.
The movie was also only barely watchable  for the elementary school crowd at our house.
2 stars, not quite making  it to 3 stars...
...there were also too few scenes involving Dudley's  horse, and Nell.
Good luck out there.

Brendan  Fraser is totally convincing as the Goody-two-shoes Dudley, and Alfred  Molina is a scream as Snidley Whiplash.  Eric Idle as the Teacher is goofy  as usual.  The Kumquat (sp?) Indians are also a riot. (Riverdance?)  The  only problem I really have is Sarah Jessica Parker.  To me, she didn't seem  to really pass of as a believable Nell Fenwick, Dudley's Love Interest.

The expression on his face for the most part was ""do I really want to be  here?"". Sarah Jessica Parker would have been my 10th choice of ladies  to play the part of Nell (I guess Sex & the City is where she belongs).  Also being a Python fan, the inclusion of Eric Idle originally got my  interest up....but sadly the role given him was a complete misuse of his  comic genius....he would have been better suited as Snidley.

It incorporates great acting talent into a comedic structure that spells out quality but does not take itself seriously.  Everything is very well done including the actualization of the characters.

1258680,1,B000035Z2V,"There had been a fad in Hollywood decades ago for making live-action versions of old television cartoons. None really worked, but this one has done more badly than the others. Of course, it didn't help that Dudley Do-Right cartoons were invariably shorts, rather ones that beget complicated situations.

The cartoon had the premise of a strong and handsome but dense hero doing battle against the villain Snidely Whiplash, succeeding in the end when he finally uses his head. (One episode has him fooling Snidely into thinking some dynamite exploded when it didn't because he tricked him using a recording of an explosion-but Dudley had failed to defuse the real dynamite.) So what happens here? Snidely starts a fake gold rush, and Dudley eventually foils his plans. This could have been the basis of something good, but a confusing and unfunny story, ethnic stereotypes, and performers who don't correspond very well to their cartoon equivalents make this a bad movie. Even Dudley Do-Right completists should stay away.",1433289600,,1021,5.150602409638554

1258682,2,B000035Z2V,"Released in 1999, Dudley Do-Right is a live-action version of the 60s cartoon with Brendan Fraser in the title role, Alfred Molina as Snidely Whiplash, Sarah Jessica Parker as Nell and Eric Idle as Dudleys master.

The movie was advertised as brought to you by the producers of George of the Jungle, which of course implies that it might be in the same ballpark in quality. Unfortunately, thats not the case at all. While the two movies share a couple of the same producers they don't share directors or writers. Dudley Do-Right was directed and written by Hugh Wilson who directed/wrote the amusing Blast from the Past, which came out six months before Do Right. As such, you would think Do-Right would be a decent goofy comedy, but its not. Its starts off with an overlong, irrelevant and pointless cartoon and never recovers. The zany jokes fall flat except for a couple and this is from someone who enjoys stoo-pid humor.

Whats utterly amazing is that Do-Right cost a whopping $70 million in 1999 dollars. Blast from the Past only cost half that much and George of the Jungle (1997) $15 million less (than ""Do-Right"")! Whered all the money go? You certainly don't see it on the screen or in the writing. Of course, Fraser is likable and fitting as Dudley and Molina eats up the role of Whiplash, but their jokes are lame and unfunny. Parker might have worked, but shes underutilized. Really, the only sequences that perked my attention are the Native American theater scenes and, in the third act, when Dudley morphs into a bad dude to beat Whiplash, but even these scenes aren't anything to write home about.

Simply put, Dudley Do-Right is a DUD.

The film runs 77 minutes and was shot in British Columbia and Santa Clarita, CA.

1258709,4,B000035Z2V,"What worked for Brendan Fraser in both this live-action version of an animated satire and George of the Jungle is what distinguishes him from other actors. Fraser is a good-looking man by any estimation who willingly puts himself into awkward, ridiculous and largely funny situations in movies. If one stops to think, there are not many so-called studs in Hollywood who project that same willingness in comedies - it is often done with some noticed reluctance. Therefore you can always expect that gung-ho attuitude from Fraser which in the end invariably gets rewarded. In the case of &
Dudley Do-Right"" it makes the change Dudley experiences from a totallly straight arrow to a some rules are there to be broken attitude toward life in order to bedevil Snidley Whiplash. Alfred Molina plays the villain gone semi-legit with great bravado yet losing the bad-guy voice from time to time (whether that was by design or not I don't know). A scene stealer is Jack Kehler as Whiplash's disheveled chief henchman Homer (in the cartoons Homer was the equivalent of a troll). The ""Ninja"" scenes between Fraser and Eric Idle are hilarious to be balanced by a good-bye scene that was in no way maudlin in its emotion (good writing!). The one aspect from the original cartoons that was not touched by this movie was that while Dudley was in love with Nell Fenwick Neil was more in love with Dudley's Horse. Given that ""Dudley Do-Right"" was geared toward as general an audience as possible it is understandable why this element was cut out of the screenplay. The irony was that an actress who would become forever associated with the raw eroticism of ""Sex and the City"" would play Nell in this movie. How much Sarah Jessica Parker was utilized is up for debate by viewers. Happily they do give a nod to Miss Sarah's Broadway background by providing a dance number done to ""Did You Ever Have To Make Up Your Mind"" which pairs her at times with Fraser and Molina plus a brief turn with Robert Prosky as her father the Inspector. From the dance scene on ""Dudley Do-Right"" is especially good! A must for fans of Fraser and Molina.",1375142400,,2115,4.718918918918919

Brendan Fraser, usually at home in this type of broad farce, amazingly falls flat on his face in this one (and no pun intended).  Likewise, Sarah Jessica Parker is given too little to do and what she does isn't broad enough (like her role in MARS ATTACKS).  Alfred Molina's villainous turn as Snidely Whiplash is the strongest point of the movie, but even he has some low moments.

I saw George of the Jungle but was offended by it in certain parts. I came to this movie really expecting a better George of the Jungle (as promised in the trailer gag (no, I'm not kidding.) ""From the STAR of George of the Jungle and the PRODUCER of George of the Jungle and the NARRATOR of George, etc."" and lastly, I came to the movie with a clean mind (this isn't gonna be PC, but if you see everything in sexual or homosexual overtones, you're gonna see everything in this movie under those tones. If you're not, you won't.).
That said, I got a blast out of this movie. This is not an intelligent movie, this is a fun movie. I love it's randomness: From miniature golf to indians with New York accents, you're never sure where the laughs are going to strike next. I nearly died during the ""training"" scene.

1258736,1,B000035Z2V,"I picked this movie up fresh after watching George of the Jungle, expecting to find another unpolished gem.  Boy was I wrong.  This movie is unpolished alright, but there is no gem hiding underneath.  After this and Monkeybone, I lost a lot of respect for Brendan Fraser as an actor.  He's made a lot of quality films, but at the same time he makes some real dogs which makes me wonder if he even bothers to read a script before the signs on to do a project.  This was a movie that has the potential to be great, but instead winds up being horrible.
If you are looking for a good movie that is fun for the whole family, skip this one and pick up George of the Jungle.  Better yet, pick up a book to read together with the family.  There are some absolutely fantastic books out there that will appeal to every member of the family no matter how young or old.  Everyone knows about the Harry Potter books, and more and more people are beginning to discover King Fortis the Brave, another ""young adult"" book that fantasy and adventure fans of all ages are finding they just can't put down.  Whatever you do, stay away from this movie.",1037836800,4,1131,4.322274881516588
1258737,2,B000035Z2V,"A Score of 2 is a Little Harsh, Its Really more of a 2 1/2, but be Warned, when Considering Seeing, Hiring or Buying ""Dudley Do-Right"", Ask yourself these 3 Questions. 1: Do you Enjoy seeing people Fall Over? 2: Do you Enjoy Funny Sound Effects (eg. Boooiiinnnggg, Tweety Bird Noises). 3: Do you Enjoy seeing Horses blow Raspberry's at people and Pass Gas? If you said No to all three, run away from this film as Fast as you Can. If you said Yes to One, See it when it hits Cable. If you said Yes to Two, Hire it. If you said Yes to All Three... Buy It Now; It Is Your Dream Film.
When I asked Myself these questions, I fell Somewhere in the Middle, I was never Hysterically Laughing at Do-Right's Antics, but I was a Little Won over by his (and the films) Childish Charm and Endless Energy. In the end, though, most of the laughs come from Pity.. or Stupidity.
Like the Somewhat Superior ""George of the Jungle"", Brendan makes a Fool of himself for an Hour and Twenty minutes for the kids, while also proving that Slapstick Isn't Dead for the Adults. (it mightn't be Dead, but it Certainly isn't Thriving)
Brendan doesn't have as much to do Physically as he did in ""George"", but he still makes a Fool of himself. The Real star of this film is Alfred Molina as Snidely Whiplash, Do-Rights Arch Nemesis. His Comically Evil Expressions and Hilarious Laugh had me laughing Every time. Sarah Jessica Parker and Eric Idle share what is left of the Screen time, (which isn't much) Neither make much of an Impression.
The Storyline is more Clever than I Imagined it would be, Every time I considered turning the film off in Embarrassment, A Clever Twist, Satirical Comment or Whiplash Laugh would force me to Stick with it, and it Is worth it, as it Does get better as it goes along. So Stick with it, even through it's Darkest moments, even the most Critical Reviewers should find a few laughs here and there.",988848000,19,1902,4.421652421652421
1258738,5,B000035Z2V,"This is a very entertaining film. It is a very funny comedy.  However much care has been was taken to depict a positive image of Native Americans.  Having a Native American background, this issue is very important.  The native American costumes & Dance numbers are most authentic  & fun to watch. .
I  am happy to see a comedy film portraying Native Americans with such respect.
Brendan Fraser looks great in costume & gives an ""over the top"" performance.
Filming locations are lush & print is pristine.
This is a nice family film to see, especially on ""Thanksgiving""!",981763200,,568,4.755102040816326

7916795,2,B000035Z2V,"Allegedly this flick was released, or unleashed if you will, in 1999.  I don't remember it.  Probably died a quick and deserved death at the box office.  What can you say about this one?  Unfunny.  Mundane.  Negligible.  Forgettable.  I will acknowledge that they do make an earnest attempt to resuscitate the absurdist satire of the original cartoons.  Unfortunately the majority of the jokes crash and burn.  A big mistake is trying to contemporize the flick.  Probably should have stuck with the ambiguous time period of the animated shorts.  The casting with the exception of Alfred Molina as Snidely Whiplash and Alex Rocco as an Indian Chief from Brooklyn make any impact.  Sarah Jessica Parker as Nell Fenwick?  No.  Brendan Fraser is clueless as to how to play the clueless Dudley.  Shocking when you consider that Fraser and director Hugh Wilson previously collaborated on the brilliant ""Blast From the Past"".  About the best you can say is this enterprise has a running time under 90 minutes as to not waste too much of your time and energy.  When are they going to stop taking beloved TV properties for butchering on the big screen?",1520121600,,1143,4.864583333333333
