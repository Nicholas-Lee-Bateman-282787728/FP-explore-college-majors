8573089,4,B00BRI9618,"It's amazing how hateful people can be when reviewing movies, even good ones.  I love this movie, I laugh most the way through.
The dvd I have plays fine. I didn't buy it from Amazon so I don't know if that makes a difference. The sound is fine, the video is fine and so are the girls.  No Academy award here it's just Softcore porn at it's best.  Similar if not one of, the movies you see on HBO late night.
It is not like some of the trash that, in all respects, has the quality of having been made in my trashy garage with my old cell phone.

If you like sexy, silly, funny movies you will like this one.",1388016000,,607,3.9917355371900825

8573091,3,B00BRI9618,Same as I saw on cable. Quality of video not as good seams as though its just dubed from original over and over but good enough for price.,1371168000,2,138,3.9642857142857144
8573092,2,B00BRI9618,"This B flick is 2005's Bikini Roundup with a new name.  It was filmed at the same time as Bikini Roundup and with the same cast.  The latter movie is the better of the two.

Kylie Wyote (now known as Belinda Gavin) is the ghost Calamity Kate that haunts a small town inherited by Stacy (the beautiful and ubiquitous Beverly Lynne) and coveted by J.R. Masterson (Jay Richardson).  J.R.'s men, played by Evan Stone and Alexandre Boisvert (now known as Voodoo), try to scare off Stacy and her friend Annie (the surgically enhanced and Barbie Doll-esque Nicole Sheridan) by pretending to be ghosts, dressing in sheets and running around outside moaning.

All the usual suspects get naked, but there is a very low nudity-to-running-time ratio.  There are very long scenes (unnecessarily so) that just drag on.  There are only three naked starlets (the two ranch girls are only for one scene and their clothes stay on).  More sex - or at least gratuitous nudity - would really have helped this film, since there is virtually no plot, and the acting is horrible (mostly Stone and Boisvert).

There is, however, a wonderfully sexy scene in which Stacy and Annie service Calamity Kate, not knowing that she's a ghost.

You'll definitely want to keep the remote handy to fast forward through much of this movie.  Or you could get one of a dozen others with the same cast.",1367798400,10,1361,4.72457627118644
