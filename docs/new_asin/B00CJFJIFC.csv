8582508,5,B00CJFJIFC,"""In Search Of"" is a classic series about unexplained phenomenon.  Season two has a few stand out episodes that I particularly enjoyed.  ""Mayan Mysteries"" and ""Pyramid Secrets"" were good ancient mysteries episodes.  The ""Michael Rockefeller"" episode was a story that I was unfamiliar with before watching the episode, and it is a very interesting mission persons case.",1430265600,,367,5.4035087719298245

8582511,5,B00CJFJIFC,"I liked this show from the mid to late 1970's and was delighted to find I could buy them by season, instead of a box set. I great walk down memory lane with the late Leonard Nimoy , of Star Trek fame. The topics are interesting and informative. There is something for everyone covered in the series.",1426377600,,299,4.2631578947368425

8582513,4,B00CJFJIFC,"This three-disc set contains 24 episodes from the second season of ""In Search Of"", a series on unexplained mysteries and the paranormal that was syndicated across the United States in the mid- to late-1970s.  Although I am relying on memory, these episodes do not appear to have been modified or edited from their initial broadcast:  Leonard Nimoy hosts and narrates each episode and the original musical score is included.  These are not the edited versions broadcast on the A&E Network in the early 1990s.  No special features are included with this set and the audio and video reflects a 35 year-old television show.

""In Search Of"" is not a reliable resource for a modern viewer to get a comprehensive overview of the current status of the topics covered.  There are much better resources available on DVD and various cable and YouTube channels to learn about the phenomena reviewed.  However, the episodes provide great insight to how these topics were considered by experts at the time.  ""In Search Of"" is a time capsule to the thoughts of the mid 1970s and it's interesting to see how views have changed in 35 years.  A great example of this transition is the episode, ""The Coming Ice Age"" (Episode 7 on Disc 3): Experts warn about growing arctic glaciers, cooling temperatures across North America and a quickly-approaching ice age.  Nimoy comments that freezing temperatures will radically change our world and could lead to global instability.  The contrast to current investigations and warnings of global warming and climate change are fascinating.

Below are the episodes included on the three discs.

Disc 1 - The Lost Dutchman Mine/Mother Lode, The Man Who Would Not Die, Firewalkers. Mayan Mysteries, Astrology, Michael Rockefeller, Hurricanes, The Ogopogo Monster
Disc 2 - Pyramid Secrets, The Dead Sea Scrolls, Reincarnation, The Shark Worshippers, Anastasia, The Secrets of Life, Immortality, The Swamp Monster
Disc 3 - Hypnosis, Troy, Witch Doctors, Haunted Castles, Butch Cassidy, Deadly Ants, The Coming Ice Age, The Garden of Eden",1388534400,4,2053,5.147590361445783
8582514,5,B00CJFJIFC,"With the second season, In Search of... really hits its stride. I didn't realize how many episodes I had missed in this series. And what I like about this second season is the diversity. There are so many topics I normally wouldn't want to learn about and yet I found myself immersed in each.

Highlights for me?
Disc 1 - Firewalkers, Flying Dutchman, The Ogopogo Monster, Hurricanes and a fascinating episode on Michael Rockefeller.

Disc 2 - Pyramid Secrets, Dead Sea Scrolls, Reincarnation, Anastasia, The Swamp Monster, Secrets of Life and Immortality

Disc 3 - Hypnosis, Troy, Deadly Ants, The Garden of Eden, Haunted Castles and the Coming Ice Age

I was happy to find the episode I remembered from my childhood in Haunted Castles. That episode has stuck with me and although much of it is pushing the envelopes of speculation (which is the purpose of this show) I was kinda struck by how it set off some old memories of watching it the first time. Yes, nostalgia plays a part in this series but it's impossible to ignore.

I was also interested in the episode Coming Ice Age. How that sharply contrasts now, just over 30 years later (which is not even the blink of an eye in terms of climate) with global warming.

If you enjoy speculation, if you enjoy ghosts, mysteries, monsters, strange phenomena, this series is for you.

I am looking forward to getting season three.",1385596800,2,1379,4.6970954356846475
