3738774,1,B001P5YIR0,This product turned out to be Kudilini yoga!  Not what I purchased.  The box was correct.  The dvd had the step/aerobic logo on it.  But the program when I put the dvd on was a bunch of people in various sitting and laying positions with East Indian music playing.,1461542400,,264,4.326530612244898

As for Nekea, she must not be a dancer because her footwork is so sloppy and she only knows one motion with the arms--stick out your elbows and pump your fists.  Maybe there is more later in the video.",1460851200,3,370,3.972972972972973

3738779,2,B001P5YIR0,She's kind of boring.  I wish she had better music and a couple of friends to workout with. Sometimes it seems like she's making the workout up as she goes along.,1459123200,,162,4.225806451612903
3738780,5,B001P5YIR0,"We've using this every week since I bought it.

3738794,1,B001P5YIR0,Had to replace the first time because you can only hear the music and not what she is telling you to do. Received a replacement copy and it did the same thing.,1455494400,2,159,4.0
3738795,2,B001P5YIR0,Not really designed for true beginners.  Too fast paced.  The only good thing is that she does show you steps before starting the routine.,1454544000,,138,4.708333333333333

3738822,1,B001P5YIR0,"This has got to be the most ridiculous dance workout I have seen in a long time.  I love to dance and have for a long time used dance and/or aerobics as part of my workout.  She only uses about three dance steps, not done correctly, to be repeated ad nauseum, as fast as you can do them.  She seems to think that flinging yourself around like a chicken will give you a good workout.  The outfit she is wearing makes it difficult to tell what exactly she is trying to do most of the time...she seems to think she is cool though, too bad she is showing off rather than working you out.  This is only about the dance portion, not the step, for after about 6 weeks the dvd seemed to be stuck on the music only setting...never had a dvd do that before.  So, this dvd hit the trash can and it is no great loss...",1449187200,,806,4.037735849056604

3738830,5,B001P5YIR0,Enjoyed video and the video is slow enough to teach you step by step. After a couple of views you should be able to get the basic steps down and head straight to the gym for the next step class.,1441152000,6,194,3.875

3738880,1,B001P5YIR0,"The workouts are exactly what I wanted, but the audio on the Dance portion is poor, and on the Step portion it's totally unavailable. There is an option for ""Full Mix"" or ""Music Only"", but even after changing the setting, I still got zero voice audio on the Step portion. That said, the Step section is easy enough to follow without voice.",1423872000,3,339,4.483870967741935

3738895,5,B001P5YIR0,"I purchased this many years ago when I had no dance experience, was very out of shape and well over 300lbs.

It's perfect for absolute beginners--just as the title says. She walks you through every step in slow-mo before actually doing it at a regular speed. Loved it. Had she not done this I would not have ""gotten into"" dance videos.

If you have any dance experience or are somewhat in shape, you probably don't want this video. It will be too basic for you.

Other reviews commented on her technique, etc... I cannot. All I can say is this video does exactly what it's supposed to do--teach beginners. And, her voice isn't super perky and annoying which is a bonus.

It's a few years later and I'm not fat anymore. I attribute this to her videos.",1420329600,65,750,4.452554744525547

3738919,3,B001P5YIR0,it appears to be an old tape moved to DVD.  while the tutorial is fine... the actual moves are beyond my skill level and it frustrates me.  it does however get my heart rate up.,1404691200,,177,4.0285714285714285
3738920,3,B001P5YIR0,What you would expect,1404518400,,21,4.5
3738921,1,B001P5YIR0,This is a very slow dvd. I couldn't get into it because I the Cathe Friedrich beginner basic step dvd moved me up to an intermediate level. I felt that this dvd is for an elderly class. It was a complete waste of $ because I will never use it.,1404518400,,243,3.88
3738932,2,B001P5YIR0,no upper body work out just legs,1403740800,2,32,3.7142857142857144
3738933,3,B001P5YIR0,I got a video that didn't include any sound after the introduction there was silience. I think I would've enjoyed the video a whole lot better if there was sound. It's hard to know when to change step if you can't hear her tell you. I have to find a video with better volume quality.,1403481600,,283,4.163636363636364
3738934,5,B001P5YIR0,I love step aerobics!!! I love how she explains every move step by step allowing you to learn the moves before taking off. It's a great work out... Especially for mommies!!,1403222400,3,172,4.580645161290323
3738935,3,B001P5YIR0,This DVD is designed for the younger crowd (or very fit older person) as it is a medium to high level cardio workout. The instructions are clear but they move quickly throughout both the step and dance sections.  I have put this video on the shelf and God willing will use it when I get stronger & faster.,1401667200,,305,4.258620689655173
3738936,2,B001P5YIR0,This DVD is very basic and not for me.  I was looking for something a little more advanced.  I haven't been a step in a long time but never forgot how to Step.  I am sure it would be perfect for someone who has never done Step Aerobics.,1400457600,,236,3.875
3738937,3,B001P5YIR0,"THIS DVD IS BORING, WATCH IT IF YOU DON'T OWN ANOTHER ONE. SHE IS A LITTLE UMM UNINTERESTING. IF YOU LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SLOW TO GET YOU STARTED, THIS IS IT. NOT!",1398211200,,164,4.15625
3738938,3,B001P5YIR0,"This was ok, but I don't like not having the movement of simple exercises.  I think she look great but it wasn't for me.",1398038400,2,120,4.0
3738939,5,B001P5YIR0,This is my personal view that this Step and Dance Aerobics by Nekea Brown was too good for  me  as a beginner. These aerobic exercise keeps me active and healthy. I recommend to my friends and readers to buy this DVD by Nekea Brown.,1394928000,3,232,4.25
3738940,5,B001P5YIR0,Have done stepping in the past & was looking for something not to hard or easy & this fit right in there. Haven't been using it much lately but hope to pick it up again soon,1394323200,3,173,3.8333333333333335
3738941,4,B001P5YIR0,"Its a good video but you should first learn the steps at the beginning, because if you just watch the video its a little confusing to follow. But its a good begginers video",1393718400,4,172,4.242424242424242
3738942,3,B001P5YIR0,"This one is pretty good. Needs better music, but otherwise good. This one will definitely help burn some calories. Yay!",1392163200,2,119,5.0
3738943,5,B001P5YIR0,"I have purchased many ""beginner"" workout DVDs, but this one finally has an approach that I like.  Even though the other workout videos were for ""beginners,"" they went through the movements way too fast.  Nekea does a really good job of showing you the routine at a slower pace.  I will still need time to get up to speed to match Nekea, but I know I will stick to this one as the pace is more suited for me.",1388966400,5,407,4.1265822784810124
3738944,3,B001P5YIR0,This did not seem like an absolute beginners dvd especially since I had several older people in my aerobics class. She didn't speak very loud and it was hard to follow. Other than that after watching it a while one could probably get used to it but my people weren't willing to go on.,1388620800,,284,4.277777777777778
3738945,4,B001P5YIR0,"I've been out of sync with my aerobics for some time and have looked around for a dvd that would get me back in the swing. This helped a lot. I was familiar with the moves. Some new ones weren't hard to grasp, but during the actual execution of the steps I'd discovered that the instructor had some mishaps on which foot you should be working with.  I've used it a couple of times now to know when the misguidance is coming up so I won't stumble. But  other than that....it's not bad for the price. There's a dance routine for getting in shape that I don't use, but I guess it's would benefit those who want to do Dancing with the starts for beginners. Good video with a small error on guidance for those who want to sweat and get the heart in shape.",1387756800,7,750,4.165517241379311

There is a choice on the main menu for ""full mix"" and ""music only"" but there is no full mix. She's talking, but there is no sound. Another reviewer thought that the music drowned out her voice, but I don't think that's the issue. I don't think it was ever included. I'll probably keep the disc because the learning portion has voice and her cueing for both the cardio and step portions is physical as well as verbal, so I think I'll be able to manage. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who is not very familiar w/ aerobic and/or step choreography, because I think it would be difficult to follow.",1380758400,11,728,4.313868613138686

I still practice with the tutorial, and I still can't do the dance steps after about a month of workouts.  Oh, well.  I'm still not ready to give up on myself.

I have been using it regularly for about a month and have found the instructions are clear and consistent, the routine makes me sweat every time, and is easily adaptable for use with a bosu.
Update:
This is still one of my favorite videos but for the avid stepper I can see how it could get boring quickly. The routine is simple enough to master, and it definitely does the job. After about 2 months using this and Debra Mazda's Shapely girl I find myself liking shapely girl more and more, it just seems to have more to it.

I cranked up my tv volume hoping I could hear her quietly but it was no avail.  Its like the mic wasn't working at all, and they said hey what the heck no one likes the talking anyway and made the video without it.  Since I haven't done step aerobics in 10 years, I was looking forward to a beginning video but without knowing what she's doing or having any cues, I was very disappointed.  I'll try it a few more times (hey, I've got it for 3 weeks) but I would return this if I had paid for it.
