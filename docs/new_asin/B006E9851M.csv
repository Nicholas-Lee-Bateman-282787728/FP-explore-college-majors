8496823,5,B006E9851M,"I love ballet. I never got to take classes as a child, so as an adult I get the best instructors right in my own home by way of DVDs! I like this particular one because Zena explains how to execute the moves. In other DVDs of hers it is just assumed you would already know how to squeeze your legs together etc.. I know that sounds trivial, but it truly makes a difference in the workout. She has you work everything. From your toes to your head. She even has you do a back bend at the end. (More of a bridge from the floor up.) The workout will give you ballet tone and challenge you, but you have to give it your all. If you don't, you will miss the point of floor barre. By the way, just because you are on the floor doesn't mean this is easy. If you are engaging your muscles and your mind through the whole class you will feel very worked-out!!!!",1402444800,6,851,4.041420118343195
8496824,2,B006E9851M,"In all honesty I have only completed half of this workout, but I just have to say that the production value is terrible. They obviously didn't practice much before rolling video, because the guy doesn't know what he's doing. A lady actually has to walk on screen and correct him. The lady seems more practiced but still unsure of what she's doing at times. This video would be of no value to me if I hadn't already done the technique with a former ballet teacher, so I have some clue of how you are supposed to tighten and contract during the exercises. Otherwise this would be a very, very light workout of laying on your back and lifting your legs occasionally. Can't believe they sell this for $25!!!",1331251200,6,703,4.5
