4689672,5,B005G7WGP4,I love cute Christmas movies. This one has been entertaining my mom and me for quite some time. Love it,1369180800,,103,4.2
4689673,3,B005G7WGP4,"I guess it was only a matter of time - what with today's heightened awareness of foreign threats - before jolly old St. Nick's sleigh is targeted by our U.S. air defenses. Hurtling at incomprehensible speeds this unidentified bogie is still vulnerable to missile bombardment from Homeland Security. And when Santa falls off the sleigh and crashes onto the docks, it's up to a pair of kids to save him - and Christmas - from an obsessed FBI agent.

In Special Agent Erickson's (Greg Germann) defense, he thinks he's doing the world a solid. He's brushed up on extraterrestrial conspiracies. For years he's been tracking what he believes to be ""the human element in the intruder network."" But Special Agent Erickson is in the wrong film genre. This 2010 holiday flick, THE SANTA INCIDENT, is fantasy, not science-fiction. There may be folks onscreen with pointy ears, but they're not Vulcans. They're little helpers. Or, to be even more specific, they're the North Pole Search & Rescue party.

Santa Claus (James Cosmo) ends up in the local hospital, being monitored by Nurse Joanna Johnson (Ione Skye) who also happens to be those two kids' mother. Stranded and with less than a week to go before Christmas and still needing to make the toys, Santa is taken in by the Johnsons. And, no, we won't question the soundness of a mother's inviting an absolute stranger over to one's home. It's Christmastime. Let's all buy into that whole ""good will toward men"" approach.

THE SANTA INCIDENT is cute and silly and over-the-top. Above all, it's intended for kids, many of whom should get a kick out of the film's moments of mild skullduggery and Santa's collecting discarded scraps and shaping toys out of them. The grown-ups may find themselves raising their eyebrows some at Greg Germann's exaggerated bluster. I did chuckle a bit at his comic interactions with his inexperienced FBI partner. For the grown-ups, there's a smidge of romance as well. Fair warning, Ione Skye doesn't get wooed in near an epic fashion as she did in SAY ANYTHING. But, to reiterate, this movie isn't for the love birds. It's for the kids. 3 out of 5 stars.",1355270400,,2129,4.811475409836065
4689674,4,B005G7WGP4,"This is a dare I say ""cute"" little movie. I like the way Santa makes the toys in seconds! I watched with my grandkids and they loved it. It's a good kids movie without that much for the adults. But I will watch it again this year since I'm buying it right now!",1351728000,,260,3.9245283018867925
4689675,1,B005G7WGP4,"I am providing this review as a much needed reality check for people, (like me), who might read the first three reviews of this film and order it on the srength of those reviews.  That's what I did and boy, am I sorry.  Most people who watch a lot of family movies have seen those horrible movies where the antics of the ""brain dead"" bad guys is so exaggerated and overdone that it ruins the film.  The only film I can remember where the silly antics of the ignorant bad guys actually worked was in the original version of ""Home Alone"".  Unfortunately, I've seen more than my share of movies where the foolishness and overacting of the ignorant bad guys ruined the film, but the antics of the foolish bad guys in this movie wins the all time prize for scriptwriting and acting that is worse than bad.  In my opinion, for what its worth, the best word I can think of to describe this movie is IDIOTIC"".",1340841600,3,901,4.339285714285714
4689676,5,B005G7WGP4,"I enjoyed this movie the first time I had the chance to watch it, and now will enjoy it every time the Holiday Season nears, without having to wait for it to air on TV.  The story line is non traditional in a traditional sort of way.  Heart warming and delightful.",1334188800,,264,4.1568627450980395
4689677,5,B005G7WGP4,"This was a Christmas present for my Mom, she loves to watch Christmas movies. I haven't watched any of the movies that I've bought off Amazon yet, but she hasn't complained about the quality of them yet so all is good in the world!",1326585600,,231,4.2727272727272725
4689678,4,B005G7WGP4,"Though not the most well-done movie I've ever seen, it is very entertaining.  If you're looking for a holiday movie that you can just sit back and enjoy without a lot of ""thought power,"" this is it.  Good, clean fun for the whole family!",1323648000,4,237,4.363636363636363
4689679,5,B005G7WGP4,"This movie was pretty good, except that some of the actors and actresses were't very good.  The child actors seemed to play their parts much better than the adults, but I don't know if the problem was with the director or the cast.  The end result made the adults look more like this was their first role and they weren't comfortable in front of a camera.",1322438400,3,355,4.363636363636363

4689688,5,B005G7WGP4,"This movie presents the age old story of Santa and Christmas in a very creative manner.  To give you some idea, think of this.  The movie starts with a U.S. Air National Guard F-16 fighter jet on patrol.  Ground control directs its pilot to intercept a UFO that is not responding to attempts to communicate.  The F-16 zeroes in on the unknown aircraft, fires an air-to-air missile at it, and ends up shooting down Santa Claus.  Wow!  How's that for an opening to a Christmastime movie?",1389139200,,485,4.5813953488372094
