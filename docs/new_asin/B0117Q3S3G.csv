7328950,5,B0117Q3S3G,"I always wondered why fox did great transfers on Land of the Giants, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea and the Time Tunnel, but neglected Lost in Space with those horrible over digitized dvd transfers. This show has hundereds of thousands of fans and was a big slap in the face for those who bought them and expected the same quality as the others show have been. I am really excited about this new set the colors of Lost in Space should look awesome in high definition. We the fans have kept this show alive deserve it after buying and paying over 1000 thousand dollars for the
VHS columbia house versions and spending money on the bad dvd transfers. I can't wait to save shelf space and put my old vhs and dvds in storage for this new set which won't take up the same space. It's unfortunate Guy Williams and Jonathan Harris and Bob May and Dick Tufeld did not live long enough to see this set and how much joy they have given each and every one of us for doing this show. They will be missed on the dvd extras I would have loved to hear what Guy Williams views would have been for playing John Robinson. I will finally have to get my first blue ray player which I have taken my time to get since most shows I collect are on the regular dvd format. I can't wait to get it makes me feel like a little kid again even though I am 53 now and have seen the episodes at least a zillion times each. Lost in Space forever!  UPDATE YES HORRIBLE PACKAGING AND A FIGHT TO GET THE DISC OUT OF THERE SLEEVES AND LOTS OF FINGER PRINTS ON YOUR DISCS FROM THE RESULT.HOWEVER MOST LIS FANS HAVE THE INFERIOR ORIGINAL DVD SET. I SIMPLY SWITCHED MY BLUE RAYS DISCS WITH THE DISC CASES OF THE ORIGINAL DVD SET.AT LEAST THIS WAY YOU CAN TAKE THEM OUT CAREFULLY AND RETRIEVE THEM EASIER WHEN YOU WANT TO WATCH THEM.",1438819200,11,1793,4.182080924855492
7328951,5,B0117Q3S3G,"Update 9-20-15 Re:  Packaging.  The packaging is not very good.  The box is made of a very thin paper which is not made to last with extensive handling.  Each season has an accordian style disc holder insert inside a box cover which holds 6 discs (3 on each side).  Remove the discs with care.  Some are easier to to remove than others.  The disc holder inserts are very glossy so it is not diffiicult to remove the disc.  I did so without damage to any disc...no scratches nor fingerprints.  Just do it slowly and carefully and then put the discs into alternate storage cases.

7328952,5,B0117Q3S3G,Very good,1527120000,,9,4.0
7328953,5,B0117Q3S3G,The packaging on this is very poor. It is so bad that the discs risk getting damaged. I have rated it 5 stars because in all others respects this product is great.,1526774400,,163,4.125
7328954,3,B0117Q3S3G,"The picture quality was awesome. But as with other people who have reviewed this series, I have had the same issues... defective disks. Season one played fine, as did season two. Season three played fine until dusk 4. Only brand spanking new 4K Blu-ray player the disk wouldnt load and a graphic came up stating I needed some sort of a software upgrade. Really? On my a new 4K player? I put the same disk in a 2 year old model and it loaded. It played the first three episodes. When it got to the fourth episode freezing and skipping happened. The following disk... same deal.
Bottom line... what good are vibrant colors and pristine picture if it becomes Russian roulette with the disks? A bit disappointed. So why all the defective disks? Fox was probably trying to keep a certain street date for release and quality control was sacrificed. Its like everything else... you rush through a job and things fall through the cracks and mistakes happen.",1526774400,,949,4.654761904761905
7328955,1,B0117Q3S3G,"the discs are unreadable, after two separate sets iv'e lost all hope that any of these sets actually work...what a waste/disappointment.",1526601600,,136,5.523809523809524
7328956,1,B0117Q3S3G,I liked the series in general. I gave it a one star for the simple fact that about 1/3 of the episodes were defective. Either they wouldnt play at all or the recording was screwed up midway through the episode. I got the impression that it was not recorded at a professional facility. I can bot see how something like this could have been sold with that many deffects.,1526515200,,368,4.3478260869565215
7328957,4,B0117Q3S3G,"I enjoyed watching these shows, memories of the 1960s classic TV.  But the first DVD did not work and I had to get a refund.  Doesn't mean you should not buy them, I just got a lemon.  Oh well, better luck next time.  I've met the actress who plays Judy and the Robinson Mother, June Lockhart.  Billy Mumy is next on my list.

These are remastered and better than when I first watched them.  Recommended.",1526342400,,404,4.306666666666667
7328958,4,B0117Q3S3G,"My Son got this for me for my birthday (blu-ray version) - And while I've only watched about a dozen episodes so far, I must say that I am enjoying them greatly.  This is one of the shows I grew up with and it's just awesome to see it with the high resolution possible today.  It looks great.  I did have to deduct down to 4 stars for only 1 reason.  As others have stated - the packaging is just plain horrible.  I own 100's (possibly in the thousands by now) movies and TV shows on DVD and Blu-Ray and this is easily the worst packaging I've ever seen.  The disks are in a fold out - you MUST double finger (thumb and finger pinch) to get them out - horrible.
Ok.  That said - I still highly recommend these to anyone of ""my generation"".  Very enjoyable to re-watch this series in much higher quality than ""in the old days"".

7328959,5,B0117Q3S3G,Great series. Packaged nicely. Very entertaining.,1525996800,,49,7.333333333333333
7328960,5,B0117Q3S3G,Fantastic product - delivered 100% as advertised. Don't be put off by the people complaining about the packaging.,1525392000,,113,5.333333333333333
7328961,5,B0117Q3S3G,It's a great blast from the past!,1525046400,,33,3.857142857142857
7328962,5,B0117Q3S3G,Loved this show growing up.  The blu ray disks are perfect. Currently watching season 1 and no issues,1524700800,,101,4.611111111111111
7328963,5,B0117Q3S3G,"A major caveat applies here. I ordered the ""Multi-Format"" version and received a Blu Ray version. Fortunately, I have a Blu Ray player so I can enjoy this show.  But these DVDs will NOT play on a standard DVD player - you must have a Blu Ray player. If you have a Blu Ray player, then do NOT order the very expensive ""Blu Ray"" version. Buy the ""Multi Format"" version (which is, in reality, the Blu Ray version) and save $120.00. And just a comment, I can't see why an old black and white TV show should need a Blu Ray, high definition treatment. I did file a complaint with Amazon regarding the incorrect product information that does not note that this DVD set is in the Blu Ray format.

And, as virtually every other reviewer has noted, the packaging is beyond horrible. It is impossible to get the disks out of the sleeves without getting your fingers all over the playing surface. We were tempted to get out the scissors and start cutting away the heavy cardboard imprisonments, but I like to have the original packaging for my movie library. So we spent a frustrating hour at the table attempting to carefully remove each disk, cleaning same disk with a lint free cloth and then putting the disks in standard plastic DVD storage cases.

I give 5 stars because the transfer of this old show to DVD has worked very well here.  The video is crystal clear and a pleasure to watch.

Followup Edit: after playing with the packaging, we ended up putting all the DVDs in standard paper DVD envelopes which will slide right back into the original packaging. Since the paper sleeve won't quite go all the way in, you can easily grab the edge of the sleeve to remove the DVD the next time you remove it. Enter ""dvd envelopes sleeves"" into the Amazon Search box which will bring up a variety of appropriate envelopes.",1524528000,2,1810,4.48936170212766
7328964,5,B0117Q3S3G,I just played an episode on my 4k tv which I guess upscales it. I had owned the prior dvd releases years back and they were awful. Plus for all the trashing of the packaging - I don't find it all that terrible. Not the best packaging but very easy to live with,1524441600,,260,3.9245283018867925
7328965,5,B0117Q3S3G,"Despite terrible packaging, this is still an excellent Blu-Ray presentation of one of the more enduringly and indeed endearingly weird original 60s golden age of TV show classics",1524441600,,178,5.392857142857143
7328966,3,B0117Q3S3G,"As other reviewers suggest, this is a classic boxed set.  The story-lines and artificial props are so bad that they give the series its own interesting character.  Of course the packaging leaves something to be desired but this problem is easily solved by using paper sleeves for individual disc storage.  I have the Blu-ray edition.  The video remastering is excellent with crisp black-and-white images (I've not yet gotten to the color portion of the set).  In my opinion the two stars of this series are Dr. Smith and the robot.  Smith's verbal presentation leads me to believe he has a classical Shakespearean background.  The liner notes suggest that he actually improvised some lines on the spot.

Unfortunately the absolutely terrible feature of this set (and the reason for only three stars) is the audio.  The mixing of the music background is pathetic.  Music crescendos and background are grossly over-recorded relative to the voice recordings.  This problem is not what I remember occurring on the original TV series.  If I turn up the volume for reasonable voice playback I must be ready to turn down the volume for the music.  This should not happen and could have been avoided with proper mixing.  It's a real fly in the ointment so to speak.  Otherwise a great set.",1524268800,,1281,4.8930232558139535
7328967,5,B0117Q3S3G,"This Blu-ray collection is fantastic! Ive had no issues with playback and the picture and sound quality is far superior to the DVDs. I don't understand all the negative reviews on the packaging. Its colorful and easy to remove the disks. You simply hold the packing and tap from either side to remove the wanted discs. Theres no need to try and reach into the jackets. The chosen style of packaging greatly reduces the space needed for storage while insuring the discs remain protected. This entire 3 season collection takes up less space on the self than 1 season of the DVD set. With the blueprint poster, second revised shootings script of The Reluctant Stowaway and cast cards with LIS facts make this a must have for any Lost in Space fan. I believe this set earns the 5 star rating.",1524096000,,788,4.595744680851064
7328968,5,B0117Q3S3G,THANKS,1523404800,,6,6.0
7328969,5,B0117Q3S3G,"I received the Lost in Space Blu Ray disks. I am really enjoying them (considering I saw them when they were first broadcast in the 60). The problem with the cardboard disks mentioned in other reviews is negligible; however, I removed the disks carefully from the packaging and put them in 3 multi disk Blu Ray cases from Caseopiaproblems averted.",1523404800,,347,4.8
7328970,5,B0117Q3S3G,"This series is a wonderful sci fi show from the sixties and the blu rays look great. The packaging is horrible though. It's hard to get the discs out.  But the show delivers on it's promise of fun here.  The first season was the more serious one. Season two decends into fun camp and the third has many great episodes with the family once again in space and meeting strange aliens and such.  It's well worth owning and the show is one of my faves from the past.  Warning , fun to be had here and now there's a new non campy ""lost in space"" on netflix!  how cool is that?",1523232000,,570,4.099099099099099

7328972,5,B0117Q3S3G,"If you're a fan from childhood, YOU MUST GET THIS! And don't cheap out on the ""multi format"" version, you want the more expensive ""blu-ray (only)""  - even though ""all formats"" includes blu-ray - the more pricey version has exciting extras I am SO glad I opted for!! WOW! THIS IS A MAJORLY nice piece of memorabilia.  ...And the picture quality is exciting! (you can see SO much detail you never knew was there) A MUST HAVE for a fan.  ...........As to the packaging - which people say is ""horrid"" because you have to put one fingertip on a disc to get it out of its sleeve - you do have to do that BUT the packaging is actually a thing of beauty other than that. IT'S GREAT!! So I suggest either be ok with a finger tip touching the play surface, OR just cut the cardboard sleeves a little. Either way: GET THIS!!!! ....I am as excited now as the 6 year old I was, seeing it first run in the 60's.",1522972800,,897,4.173410404624278
7328973,5,B0117Q3S3G,"A fun, if a little campy, '60s television series.  The episodes look very good on BluRay Discs, and all of the audio is in the original mono mixes.  With this box set you have all three seasons in one spot, what is not to love?  Well, the cardboard pockets the discs fit in are a little stiff and some awkward shuffling is needed to remove and replace the discs into their respective places.  I would hope future issues of this box will have re-thought packaging.

After all of that, I want to mention the bonus features are quite well worth investigating.  There's a table read of a script written by Bill Mumy, that involves many of the original cast members.  A Biography of Jonathan Harris's life and career, and hours of more well worth it extras.",1521676800,,752,4.485294117647059

7328981,4,B0117Q3S3G,"First, when this blue ray set plays the quality is outstanding.  But, and there is a huge BUT, the quality of the disk is questionable.  When I got the set in, I immediately wanted to begin watching.  I loaded the first disk into my Samsung Blue Ray player and to my surprise, it stalled and froze.  I figured that it had to be the player (although its only a few years old and a top quality model) so I went out and bought another player, this one a Sony brand.  I put the disk in a it played.  Halfway through the second episode it froze again.  So I stopped the playback, sat through the introduction again and went on to episode three.  It played fine.  Im now at episode nine and the variety of disk have continued to freeze on screen three more times.
I question the quality of the disk press.  For the price of this set, it should play flawlessly.  Just a heads up to anyone who may have an older player.  But of course its doing it my new player too......
On the other hand, when it plays as it should, its like watching the series for the first time,  Im old enough to have been one of those kids who watched it during its Wednesday night 7:30 showtimes.  It was my favorite show as a kid.
Would I buy it again, yes, (my four star rating is for the content not the disk quality).",1519948800,,1288,4.141129032258065

They all had a weird wavy bunch of colored lines when you looked at the playing side, none of which shows on any other DVDs I own.

The only negative I can mention is that because of the packaging, the discs themselves are very hard to slide out of their card board sleeves. There is very little of the disc exposed to grab at. They are in so snugly that you can scratch them with the tips of your fingers trying to  get a hold of them while pulling them out.

Honestly, it was a terribly written show when I was a kid, and it's no better today. Only the look of the sets and equipment is really worth watching. The stories are (the lone exception being the unaired pilot - which was still beset by little if any real science, would it have hurt to crack open an astronomy text? and the only two-parter, the Keeper). Other than the technical aspects of the show - the effects are brilliant, this is really only for the true Lost In Space diehard, which I'm obviously not.",1514505600,,629,4.431034482758621

7329009,5,B0117Q3S3G,"This is better than the BD job I seen dome on Star Trek TOS. It's also nice to hear the whole living crew (absent June Lockhart) in commentary. Too bad, like the old Dr Who series, they didn't offer commentary for every episode.

Now the main reason I write. I only got into interest in captioning, because my mother was totally deaf and depended on captioning or subtitles to enjoy her video watching. Mom died over four months ago, but CC still has interest for me, and it really should for a lot of us, even if we think we'll never go deaf and don't care about those that do. The selfish reason one should consider CC (or subtitles) in a product is because it can be used at times to clear up dialogue you cannot hear, even if your hearing is excellent, or dialogue that is drowned in other sounds on the video. I will say, that fairly often CC and subtitles are pretty poor or completely wrong, so commenting on CC type media can be quite important to some.

So I will mention here that after perusing an episode using the subtitles, it really is excellent, though I did see one mistake. It is excellent because it often will put the name of the speaker on the line given, should the speaker be off camera. It also will jump the text around, to often show directly who is doing the speaking of the lines. It's not limited to two lines at a time, and it isn't limited to the bottom of the screen. Having seen a lot of CC material in my life with Mom, it's interesting to see the text, because though it usually will slide underneath whom is currently speaking, it will at times go to their chest or face, which in comparison to the usual method of CC, is almost hypnotic; sort of like following a ball at a tennis match. It's not as maddening as following a tennis ball, but it is almost entertaining, as though it's alive.

The one mistake I saw for the 3-4 minutes I watched it with subtitles, is it at one point went to Major West's face when Robinson was actually speaking, but otherwise it was flawless and it didn't misspell or even leave one word out. When it showed the robot say WARNING 8 times, that's precisely how many times he said it; quite excellent. It also has the habit of showing an entire sentence at a time, all at once, which to me makes it easier to read. It also seems to only disappear when the next sound occurs, although it doesn't display forever if there is silence. LIS can be pretty fast paced dialogue at times, but at least there's always the rewind and then pause to pick up the missed bits.

 Don't think that there aren't foreign films you wouldn't want CC or subtitles for. I have found them fairly indispensable when watching british shows on disc. Incidentally, each season has a different menu to go through, and season three may be the best one. I think the BD treatment of S3 may be the best too, unless it's all the same and I'm just imagining it.",1504656000,,2893,4.330258302583026

7329029,5,B0117Q3S3G,"One of the best TV sci-fi's. At the time, I actually liked this better than Star Trek and Batman, but I still liked Bewitched and Walt Disney's World of Color just as well. This is a great series boosted by the swell score. The first season is pure awesome and it sort of tapers down into the color seasons but the dramatic intro to the third season, I believe, with the countdown is a great update to the score. The first season plays like a movie with dramatic episodes and for some reason it falls into a comedy with color episodes. The comedy is excelled by the continuing Dr. Smith antics and his involvement with space aliens all the way down to the carrot man. I really, really do like this series quite a bit, and it has fond memories for my family as we gathered for each episode with it's cliffhangers. Excellent cast and some very solid memorable episodes such as the space hillbillies, the keeper, trip back to Earth, and the android and floating green woman in space.

7329033,4,B0117Q3S3G,"A positive review and I give my discoveries into the faulty disc issue. I think LIS is probably my favourite tv series of all time. I remember seeing some episodes in the original run, Australia was about 6 months or more later than in the US. I watched it in re-runs.  I rented as many as I could find on VHS, I bought the DVD set, which wasn't very good in the 3rd season, you could see what might be called horizontal combing lines in it. Now this.

I've seen a few discs and the picture and sound quality are very good. Even the sound is exceptional. I've seen extras like 'The Ballad of Will Robinson' on disc 4, which Billy Mumy recorded in 1997 and there was a fan made video. I had a look at the beginning of 'Lost In Space: Epilogue' on the final Season 3 disc of bonuses, which shows remaining cast members in 2015 with replacements for deceased ones. I've looked at many of the discs in testing, and the menu for Season 2 is quite stunning. But some things required investigating.  Added by edit: This set has resume and bookmarks on them, which is something very much needed on bluray discs of a tv series, but lacking on many (eg. Batman, The Monkees).

What am I looking at? For a 4:3 TV show, this is wider than usual. I started wondering if the picture had been stretched at all. I quite hate this type of thing. I keep wondering if people's faces are wider than they originally are. Dr. Smith and John Robinson naturally have quite squarish faces. I can accept that no widening has occurred, so maybe it was cropped. The commentaries really are quite interesting to listen to because they include surviving cast members. But the TV expert kept saying we were seeing more now with the bluray version, but I couldn't see what they were referring to, so I wonder if cropping has occurred and they saw something different (on a huge screen). I will leave for now whether more is actually being shown.  Added by an edit: Possibly the wide face issue is worse in the very early episodes, I'm just saying that because I think I'm noticing it less by disc 5.

The discs issue. Before buying this I read reviews that discussed the issues with packaging and faulty discs. I had already discovered that blurays have an unusual property where contact with the data surface can cause temporary playback faults.  So I've been posting about it. After getting the discs I thought this was less important, but it is so. Season 1 Disc 1 had freezing and skipping about 17:55 minutes in to the 3rd episode on the disc. I visually inspected a number of discs and found scratches near the edge of Season 1 Disc 1 and Disc 2. On Disc 2 the 5th episode had worse freezing and skipping from about 19 minutes in. I saw a tiny mark on the number of Season 2 discs. So I tested every one of the 18 discs in a computer drive. I only found fault with the 2 discs I mentioned. So I concluded that scratches were the reason for the faults and thought less of the unique bluray issue of pressure on the data surface. I don't believe the packaging caused the scratches, but they come from earlier, maybe when the discs were put in the packaging, I don't know. As for getting the discs out, I have little trouble. I had read someone else's review about this. You put a finger into the space, pushing out the cardboard a bit if necessary, then find the hole, on the label side, and pull out like that. Maybe holding the cardboard away a bit from the data side with the finger, and putting the packaging upside down.

Outcome of disc issue tests: This is the important discovery I made. I had put the 2 Seasons 1 discs in thin jewel cases, which keep the data surface away from touching anything. I tried the discs again after they had been in these cases for 7 days, and there were no playback issues at all. So the problem with the discs is a combination of scratches and pressure in the packaging. Granted some people may encounter worse scratches that won't right themselves. I don't know. It can be difficult to see scratches on blurays. Certainly wipe them so tiny hairs are removed that might look like scratches. Scratches seem disproportionately worse on blurays than dvds. I have a Sony bluray player which is very good with scratches, unlike the DVD players from over ten years ago which were the opposite.",1494460800,9,4298,4.431645569620253

7329046,5,B0117Q3S3G,"Growing up in the 60's there were so many TV shows that I have vivid memories of. Lost in Space was certainly part of my childhood and revisiting it on Blu Ray was well wroth my investment of time and money.

Lost In Space had already been released on DVD a while back, I had the individual seasons and they looked very good. They also took up a lot of shelf space so when I had the opportunity to sell my DVD sets for a good price and upgrade to a much more compact Blu Ray set I was very happy to do so.

First the great news, the episodes look amazing! Blemish free for the most part and so clear you can see the cheese oozing out of the cheaply constructed sets and costumes. I love looking for repurposed creature costumes in this series. The head piece from the Metaluna Mutant from This Island Earth, Creature from the Black Lagoon's  hands, even a Planet of the Apes type mask shows up in one of the last episodes. They also reused several creatures during the series. The giant cyclops shows up a number of times.

Campiness aside, the series holds up fairly well, though but watching the entire series in a short span, I found Dr Smith a bit irritating during long binge watches. I prefer the first season over the second and third seasons because it seemed a little more dramatic the later episodes were much more comedic and campy, though I do have several favorites in the later part of the series.

The bonus material is plentiful and well done. Commentaries, feature-ettes with the cast,  TV spots, promos, behind the scene footage, it's all here. The packaging is very attraction and while some really hate these types of sleeves, I have never found them to damage my discs. They are laminated, have nice graphics and they will serve me well for many years I'm sure. I would have preferred  spindle type holders, but they have their own quirks. The fold out style of the holder is a little irritating but certainly not anything to down grade my rating for. Once you get used to it, it is perfectly acceptable.

I did have a couple of discs slur for a moment or two, but when I wiped them off and actually did a software upgrade on my player they worked perfectly so I don't think there were any defects on my discs. Overall this is a fan of the series's dream come true, except for the attractive, but irritating packaging, this is an A+ effort. I enjoyed watching the series again, but after watching every episode over the course of a few weeks , it will be some time before I return to it again.",1490918400,,2514,4.379828326180258

I watched my first one last night from Season 1 (B&W, ""All that Glitters"") and the level of detail is amazing.  Dr. Smith looks like he had been through the ringer when he had to stay out all night outside of the spaceship.  The up close shots of his face really showed a worn out man, far more detailed than anything we'd seen before in this series.  That's to be expected, this is Blu-ray, but they did one heck of a job on the restoration.  My old DVDs of this series looks so tired and dated now.  I took a couple of peaks at some of the Colored episodes from Season 2 and the colors are really vibrant, but not over done.  Now that this set has dropped down in price, it is easily worth the money for the upgrade, IMO.

To be fair, there is a sprinkling of serious insights, reflections, or cool trivia, but otherwise hours and hours of banal comments as if a group of non-cast members are watching these shows for the first time Oh, look!  Whats That?  Whats going on?  Whats this one about?  And hearing these icons from my past sit around and giggle with juvenile sexual innuendoes about a classic family show was a real downer.  There is one where they are in such hysterics over thinking some set pieces look phallic, that they completely abandoned the commentary.

Cleaned both sets multiple times with both soft cloth as well as mild soap and water then drying with a soft cloth but nothing helps.

7329106,3,B0117Q3S3G,"First off, I have to agree with so many of the reviewers here that the packaging is awful. In addition, some of the discs have issues in that they show up as ""BD-ROM"" discs and I have had to turn my Blu-Ray player off an on again to get them to play properly. Plus the fact that it is a top of the line Sony multi-region deck which plays literally everything with no problems, except these pups. And it is particularly irksome in that I am also in the process of finally burning portions of my vast VHS collection to DVDs and I am not experiencing any problems with that so it seems ludicrous in this day and age that a professional outfit would produce such a shoddy product.

As to the show itself, I loved it as a child but when I tried to rewatch it when USA Network had it in rerun circulation I realized for me a lot of it was unwatchable due to my present sensibilities. However, I've always though season 1 (B/W) was decent and that the show had started out on good direction, and then later went astray. And indeed I am enjoying watching the earlier episodes, particularly ones like ""My Friend Mr. Nobody"" which I hadn't seen for a long, long time. It has such a wonderful magical quality and although fanciful really stands up as a showcase for Penny's character. And actually it is sort of inferred that the millions (or even billions) year old cosmic entity that is ""Mr. Nobody"" is controlling the far-out manifestations such as the magical fountain and bowing tree, and unlike a lot of modern TV shows and movies doesn't belabor the point with tedious over-explanations. Likewise, although some people have complained about scientific inaccuracies such as the LIS depictions of comets as being giant flaming balls instead of ""dirty snowballs"" (to quote from Carl Sagan), honestly most of the 60s TV audience probably thought of them the same way. Now it is true that, although OK in tone, ""The Oasis"" does suffer from the ludicrous notion that Dr. Smith's pituitary gland going awry could cause him to grow to enormous size without explaining the colossal increase in his mass as well as his clothes growing as well! But I am looking forward to rewatching ""The Keeper,"" which I remember as being very good. I don't know how far I'll get through the season 2 & 3 fare, although I had rewatched ""Condemned of Space"" during the USA LOST IN SPACE syndication and it didn't seem too bad.

Of course as Bill Mumy has said, the LIS writers tried to compete with BATMAN, with dubious results. And it is true that Jonathan Harris was writing all his own dialog by that time and pushing himself into the forefront of the show to the detriment of some of the other cast with of course Guy Williams being turned from the star into a bit player. And it's also true that sometimes TV shows shift in their tone and direction and actually are improved by it, an example being THE AVENGERS which started out as being a totally serious crime drama show then by the time of Diana Rigg had morphed into a different, whimsical show. But THE AVENGERS, and THE WILD WILD WEST for that matter, were witty and clever while a lot of the later LIS became just silly and idiotic. But I suppose a counter argument could be that LIS did and still does entertain children, which was definitely was its core audience, and that's fine.

And I'm actually looking forward to the new Netflix version of LIS because I think it does have a chance of being very good, if it adopts a more season 1 sensibility. And what would be really cool is if they try to recreate a genuine LIS look to the new show, and even maybe having some of the planets at least look like they exist in the LIS universe.",1472688000,6,3669,4.473134328358209

The extras are also pretty extensive too with a good assortment to keep any LIS fan amused for several hours.

The packaging however (for me at least) was a big disappointment. The artwork and photographs used are fine... nice and sharp with good colours and are in keeping with the style of the show. The discs themselves however are virtually impossible to slide out without bending the cardboard sleeves and putting fingerprints on the discs. I would not want to repeatedly go through this every time I wanted to watch an episode. I have invested in some regular Amaray cases but now  need to sort out some artwork to put inside.

In conclusion then I would recommend this Blu-ray set for disc quality as it really is superb... but the packaging is (for me) something I can't live with so would suggest re-housing the discs for better longevity.",1471996800,,1098,4.7631578947368425

Plenty has been said regarding the show itself elsewhere, so I won't waste time with that here.  Like old-school Doctor Who, Lost in Space is an acquired taste.  If you're willing to spend the money on this set, you're probably already a fan.  The video transfer is excellent, allowing one to see details previously undetectable (this may or may not be a good thing depending on your tastes).  The audio is clear, though seems a bit loud, so you may want to dial the volume back a bit to avoid annoying your neighbors.  This set includes a nice assortment of extras, including commentary on select episodes.  There's even an option to watch certain episodes complete with the original bumpers and advertisements for those who desire a trip down memory lane.

I have exactly two complaints with this set, which prevents me from giving it a 5-star rating.  The first has been mentioned by other reviewers, that being abysmal packaging.  The three seasons are kept in separate cardboard cases and the disks in slick paper/cardboard holders inside these.  Getting the disks out without touching the surface is a true challenge.  The studio could have done much better in my opinion.

My second complaint (and mind you I'm still watching the season one disks) is that there may be a manufacturing defect with some of the disks.  My player has locked up on certain episodes on disks 4 and 5 (more specifically ""The Keeper pt 1"", ""Ghost in Space"", ""The Challenge"" and ""The Space Trader"").  On these, I had to time-skip past the point where the player locked up (missing out on upwards of 10 minutes run time) to continue the episode.  I use an Oppo Digital BDP-103 for a player, so I'm fairly sure it's not the equipment.  Blu-ray disks are extra sensitive to fingerprints, dust and scratches due to the large amount of data compressed into them.  I was pretty careful to avoid touching the disks, but the packaging makes that hard to avoid.  Your mileage may vary.

Apart from the above concerns, I'd recommend this set to any Lost in Space fan.",1471478400,2,2141,4.704301075268817
7329118,5,B0117Q3S3G,"I don't know what all the fuss regarding the packaging is all about, it was just fine.  The trick is to push the disc out from the other side to the open lip, then ""carefully"" (with your finger tips) remove the disc without smudging it with your fingers.  Smudging is what may have cause some disc not to play when they are dirty with finger prints.

Any way, this edition of the series is an absolute MUST-BUY for ALL ""Lost In Space"" Fans.  The special features are second to none with ""invaluable"" insight and information on the series, it's producers, and the cast.  The picture quality (goes-without-saying) is superlative as well.

This is a collection of the ages, and WILL BE ENJOYED to it's fullest extent.  You will see and experience just how much hard work went into the making of this show, and how the network really put it's full support behind it's success (even though it only ran for 3 years).

You will learn that a 4th season was in-fact planned, but I think the ""Junk-man"" episode (in season 3) is what changed the minds of the suits. ""Lost In Space"" would have ran much longer if the network had brought in better writers.

It is my personal belief that they (the network) had spent so much money on the talent and crew, that there was not much money left for some of the better writers in Hollywood who were working on other shows like ""Mission Impossible"", ""Hawaii 5-0"" and others.

You will learn some very crucial insights about the show's creator (Irwin Allen) that will convince you that he was way ahead of his time.

WITHOUT QUESTION, YOU WILL ENJOY THIS COLLECTION!!!  BUY IT TODAY!!!!!",1471478400,3,1616,4.572916666666667

7329124,3,B0117Q3S3G,"I loved ""Lost in Space"" when I was a kid in the 1970's. I would rush home from school and tune in the local UHF kids show which played the re-runs daily. I have fond memories of the creepy plant monsters or the growling monster aliens, in particular there was a plaster-like monster that scared the hell out of me...and I loved it.

I've revisited the odd episode here and there, but never actually watched the series. I saw that it was streaming on HULU and decided to watch the show from beginning to end. I will say that there are some really great episodes of the series, some that hold up pretty well almost 50 years later, for the most part though, the show hasn't aged well, and by the end of the third season it's plain to see why the show's legacy is more about the Robot and Dr. Smith.

The first season contains most of the best episodes, and I think that's because they take the show seriously (well most of the time anyway), and you care about the Robinsons and their predicament. The F/X are pretty solid too for a weekly mid-60's TV show. It's the second and third seasons where things go off the rails, and the focus of the show shifts from the family to Dr. Smith, and his over-the-top comedy. Smith whines and cries in buffoonish style through most of the episodes, all of which seem to fall into a similar pattern:
1 - Dr. Smith unwittingly puts himself and the Robinsons in danger by doing something foolish or greedy.
2 - The alien of the week (interchange space Vikings - space cavemen - space carnival) wants something or someone from the Robinson party.
3 - Dr. Smith agrees to the aliens' demands and hands over either a piece of equipment or one of the crew, in hopes of returning to Earth.
4 - The remainder of the Robinsons find out what has happened and mount a rescue or retrieval mission.
5 - The Robinsons successfully retrieve their property or person, and reprimand Smith who acts ashamed and apologizes.
6 - Preview of next week where Smith once again jeopardizes the crew or ship.
Each show follows the same basic premise of every ""Gilligan's Island"" episode, but padded out to fill an hour long show, with Smith in bumbling Gilligan role.

Might be worth it for the nostalgia factor if you grew up watching the show, but I can't imagine this will find a new audience.",1470096000,,2304,4.442080378250591

7329127,5,B0117Q3S3G,"As a major fan of this show, I already had the DVD set from a few years back, but when I saw this Blu-Ray set I had to give it a try. The improved quality alone made it worthwhile, but the commentaries delivered by the 4 youngest cast members was a really cool bonus. My hat's also off to Kevin Burns who was largely responsible for the restoration being sold to Irwin Allen's widow, and to Mike Clark who adds a tremendous amount of insight to every aspect of the show (I thought I was the show's biggest fan- he's THE MAN when it comes to Lost in Space Trivia) during the commentaries.

I've also read some of the other reviews about difficulty in getting the discs out without damaging them- while I understand what they were talking about, I didn't really have any problem with them (and none of it resulted in scratched discs). In fact, I prefer the sleeve as a pocket, over the press-in type because those are either too tight (and some of the 'teeth' break), or they're loose & the discs end up bouncing around in the box- and are definitely scratched by then. So it's not quite the big deal I though it would be- just take your time & slide them out smoothly.

Consider sharing this series with friends, family or anybody who might appreciate the values presented in TV series' from that era- it's so hard for kids to get the same positive messages delivered in content today- makes a great Christmas present.",1469318400,4,1417,4.425287356321839
7329128,1,B0117Q3S3G,"No matter how sharp and clear the restored picture is supposed to be or how great the special additions are, if the Blu-ray disc doesn't play, its worthless.  Seriously, I have NEVER had a disc not play in my Samsung Blu-ray player before.  What is weird is that the 20th Century Fox intro plays and then - nothing.  I tried 4 different discs from this set before I just gave up. Sad.  Very sad. (And it's not like Blu-ray is a new technology or anything.)",1469232000,4,456,4.329411764705882
7329129,5,B0117Q3S3G,"Buying this Blu-Ray set is a no-brainer of you loved growing up on the show. The table read of Bill Mumy's script is worth the price alone. All of the extras are so fantastic...this a just such a wonderful buy as everything from the extras to the original programs are crystal clear and the sound is beyond cool. I recommend 100% buying this as you will NOT be disappointed.

I was so pleased after watching the table read of Bill Mumy's script and Kevin Burns, the producer behind the Time Tunnel reboot (did not sell) and many other great programs, voices Dr. Smith as Jonathan Harris has passed, on the table read and he nails Dr. Smith's voice perfectly. Guy Williams Jr. steps into his father's position as John Robinson and Veronica Cartwright voices Mrs. Maureen Robinson as June Lockhart is 91 and is unable to contribute. Guy Williams daughter also participates but I will not spoil her role in the table read.

The packaging:

This is what I did after reading the reviews about the very poor packaging, which is spot on. I used latex gloves and carefully removed each disc. I then purchased  double DVD cases from Amazon...50 for 18.99 and each season fits in three DVD cases for a total of 9 cases for all the episodes and extras. Done and easy!

7329142,1,B0117Q3S3G,"The low star rating is not at all about content. I love Lost In Space and Amazon's return procedure was very customer friendly. The problem was with the quality of the disks. When the first two disks of the first set gave me problems (skipping, freezing, not loading) I tried to play them on another player which worked in most cases; or, I would just persist in trying to get a disk to load and meet with some success. However, when the last episode on disk two of the first season would not play through without freezing and skipping on two different players I decided to send the set back. Of course, there was also the inch long scratch I found on disk two of the first season. I do not see how I could have scratched the disk even with the horrible packaging. I do not believe card board containers are a bad way to store a DVD, but it is probably not as good as plastic. I have to agree with other customers: there appears to have been some problems with quality control when this blu ray set was produced. Despite all of this, I am going to buy another set just as soon as my refund comes through. I cannot just buy a new set right based upon this experience. When you are expecting a joyful experience and get something like this it makes you cautious. Anyway, the first thing I will do when I receive my replacement set of LIS will be to check all of the disks to make sure they at least load.

Pity only one episode was done in surround sound and took advantage of the extra data from original filming in wide screen.  They did dabble a bit in some CG work like removing the wires from cast floating around in J2 in Reluctant Stowaway.  However they did not give it the Star Trek treatment of CG enhancement.  No I wouldn't want them to mess with the great scenes of the J2 in the early episodes like the crash in Island in The Sky.  But they could have added new effects for episodes like Target Earth and Visit to A Hostile Planet where we see the J2 land in that exact same yellow circle seen in season 2.  Irwin Allen cost saving recycling that could have been made magnificent with a little work.  Imagine seeing the Jupiter landing in that alien city in Target Earth, or coming to land in that town in Visit to A Hostile Planet.

7329147,5,B0117Q3S3G,"This series I watched when I was a child is well worth buying on Blu-Ray, especially if you find it on sale.  50 years after I first watched these shows on TV, I am seeing details I hadn't imagined were even there.  I started watching from the beginning, and so far I'm on disc-5 (of 18 total) and still watching season-1.  Some episodes have audio commentaries by cast members.  Bill Mumy's comments are particularly insightful. For those who haven't seen the series, or watched it in a long time, season-1 is the best and is a nice family adventure with some consideration of reality.  In season-2 the show was filmed in color and the focus shifted to Will and Doctor Smith, and stories got silly.  In season-3, the cliff-hanger endings were dispensed with, and the the silliness level was usually over-the-top.

I'm giving this set 5-stars for the content.  If I rated the packaging, I'd only give it 1 or maybe 2 stars.

The discs are housed in 3 folding cardboard sleeves with slots for discs on both sides.  These don't protect the discs very well, and it is almost impossible to get the discs out of the slots without tearing the sleeve and getting fingerprints on the discs.

The 1:37 picture allowing us to see more of the image on the left and right sides than ever before makes for a perfect viewing experience.  All of the extras are incredible.  There are some minor audio inconsistencies in some episodes that are hardly worth mentioning, because the overall quality is simply amazing.

7329173,5,B0117Q3S3G,"Wow, I had been reading so much about the horrible packaging that I almost didn't buy this set.  I'm so glad I did.  And I got it for $20 USD cheaper ($70) from a guy in Massachusetts on Ebay, so I figure I'm pretty lucky.  The packaging wasn't THAT horrible.  I've seen worse.  X-Files DVD set from Germany with all the extras (250.-- more than the new set without the Extras disc per season) was a horrible cardboard book that didn't at all protect the discs.  With the LIS set, I was able to simply bend down the other side of the accordion thingy, get my finger in and slide the disc out.  It wasn't that hard, but in any case, I put them in some separate Blu-ray holders and I cataloged them in my software and slipped them side-by-side  with the original packaging in a cabinet.  Not really a big deal, folks.  No matter what you've been hearing.  I thought the extra little things in the box were so cool:  the cards, the shooting script copy of ""The Reluctant Stowaway"", and the plans for the robot.  Lots of fun.  But the neatest thing is the extras.  10x more than many other sets.  The thing I loved and felt was more priceless than anything else was watching the episodes with the cast commenting, sometimes along with a couple other good commentors.  But Mark Goddard, Marta Kristen, Bill Mumy, and Angela Cartwright had such fond memories and said such wonderful things about the show.  It was so heart-warming just to listen to all their memories.  It really was something special, LIS.  The Trekkies (of which I'm also an avid one) often don't quite get it. Yes, LIS got a bit campy, and that was hard for me, too, but still what can compare to a second season episode like ""Trip Through the Robot"" or a third season ep like ""The Anti-Matter Man""?  My personal favorite is the 1st season however.  Angela gives such a sensitive performance in ""The Magic Mirror"" and Bill is so wonderful in ""Return From Outer Space"", my favorite ep.  These are priceless.  Can any other series hold a candle to episodes like these?  Well, at least I don't think so.  LIS is about family and love, as the cast says in ""Return"" if you watch the cast commentary version of the ep.  I couldn't agree more.  Forget the mediocre and remember the best.  There really is something special about this series.  I love all scifi, but I have to admit at the end of the day that this is my favorite.  I'll take the bad with the good.

UPDATE:  I have just found something wonderful!  Not available on amazon, but here on E-bay and will take care of us 99.9% who want to get rid of the horrid disc packaging.  It is a kit, which consists of high-quality standard Blu-ray disc holders (ca. 1 cm. thick, will hold 6 Blu-rays), high-quality scans or copies of the front and back of the accordion thing for front and back covers for the disc holders.  Also included is a booklet for each season, scans or copies of the pages in the accordion packaging containing the lists of which episodes are on which disc.  This is wonderful.  I've already bought 3 of them for myself and family members.  You can find it on E-bay here:  [...].  If this address ceases, try looking for ""Lost in Space Blu ray Series *NEW* Diskless E-Z Disk Access Packaging BUDGET KIT"" and costs currently about $32.00 USD including postage.  It is put out by ""rcavcrguy"" (E-bay user name).  Hope this helps y'all!  It surely has helped me and is a perfect solution for the most complained about packaging I've ever heard about.  So definitely buy the LIS Blu-rays and then get this kit off E-bay.  Happy watching!",1456185600,7,3565,4.482866043613707
7329174,5,B0117Q3S3G,"The Lost in Space Blu-Ray set is phenomenal !! The picture quality is amazing. I own the entire series on dvd from many years ago. I compared the difference between it and the blu-ray, and previous black and white scenes (Season 1)that were very dark with murky details are now crystal clear with sharp details revealing all actual tones of black, white, and grey. The color (Season 2 & 3) is brilliant and pops right out of the screen. There are tons of great extras in this set too which have never been previously released. I recommend buying the version with the special 3D robot packaging because it is more sturdy than the basic version which has a very thin case. IMPORTANT TIP: The discs are in envelope pages and are very difficult to remove. My method was to gently lift envelope edge (spreading it apart carefully) just enough to slide a piece of masking tape far enough in to reach disc. I then pressed down on envelope so masking tape contacted disc. Then, you can easily slide the disc out without tearing the envelope page. Afterwards, just insert the disc back in to the edge only, and you can remove it easier in the future. The masking tape works well for this and doesn't leave any residue on the disc. In conclusion, get this set and enjoy the show at a quality level you've never see before.",1456185600,,1312,4.516806722689076

The quality of the episodes is brilliant and slightly larger than the normal 4:3 aspect ratio we're used to. The special features are absolutely excellent, no stone has been left unturned to bring the viewer the ultimate ""Lost In Space"" experience. My only complaint is the packaging and the accordion style cardboard season sleeves that hold the discs. Extremely difficult to remove the discs without touching the playing surfaces or tearing the inner packaging, no matter how hard you try. I remedied this by purchasing 18 individual CD jewel cases and a box designed to hold the said discs and cases to make life easier. For anyone who is a fan of ""Lost In Space"" this is the version to get. Highly recommended and the included extras such as the photos and the reproduction script of the first episode ""The Reluctant Stowaway"" are worth it.

I read about the issues with the packaging and was expecting to deal with them upon arrival.  I have to say that it really is not as big a problem as others have stated.  The discs were fairly easy to remove from the Season 1 and 3 holders; however, I think whoever designed the Season 2 holder must have been on some 60s psychotropic drugs (bubble-headed booby).  If it was the same as Season 1 and 3, it would have been better, but why design it where you have the openings facing each other in the fold of the holder (it does not compute)?  They are really difficult to remove.

I love the extras that were included.  I can't wait to sit down and really immerse myself in them.  I'm looking forward to the commentaries on the various episodes as well as the ""epilogue"".",1448236800,,1001,4.253968253968254
7329210,3,B0117Q3S3G,"I'm surprised the price dropped below 75 dollars so I purchased it. This Blu Ray is excellent quality.  The picture is so sharp!  You will not be disappointed with the quality of the transfer.  But, the packaging....... I'm finding it hard to believe that someone at 20th Century Fox can be that incompetent to produce or accept this kind of packaging for this product.  Therefore, I've come to the conclusion that it must be someone's high school dropout kid that came up with this packaging (summer job). How else can you explain for this heronious packaging.  You have an accordion style packaging where the discs slide in between the cardboard sides (slots).  I'm trying to figure out how they got them in there without scratches. When I was finally able to get the discs out (very gently) , my fingerprints were on them. I've decided to store the discs in a 6 disc case for each season.  I had to come up with 3 of these cases.  No way was I going to put the discs back into the tight fit-cardboard slots.

The first disc of the first season wouldn't even play. My Blu Ray player wouldn't even acknowledge the disc.  I had a few more discs that would freeze up. I was not going to watch the episodes out of order nor, did I want to ship this back to Amazon.  So, what I did was I cleaned those discs with a soft cloth.  Bare in mind the discs were spotless-except for my fingerprint in getting the discs out of the slots.  I still cleaned them, rubbing gently.  Finally, all discs including the one that wouldn't play, started to play and without freezing up.  You may want to try this if you have discs that freeze up.

Would I have paid over 100 dollars for this?  Absolutely NOT!!  The packaging sucks. I suggest you get a 6 disc case holder for each season and have them ready before this item arrives at your home...if you purchase it.  If you buy this as a gift for someone you may want to supply the 6 disc cases with your gift too. Or, your friend/family member might be irritated with you.  :-)

The extra's were fun to watch.  I'd rather have a holder that held the discs in place though. The pictures that are on this accordion style packaging are very good. I'd rather have a booklet which included all those pictures instead of this accordion style package.  My head is still shaking on this packaging.",1448150400,26,2320,4.419811320754717

My main point is the packaging.  My goodness!! We're not in the 20th century anymore! Surely by now, we've learned that people don't like to touch the playing surface of an investment. Why, oh why then, on a BluRay to boot, is this horrid packaging allowed?  You are FORCED to touch the playing surface.  There is no other way to get the discs out short of cutting the cardboard holders. What are you thinking people?? For a $100+, you could use a better holder than that!

7329223,5,B0117Q3S3G,"While I agree that the packaging sucks--it's very cardboard and you have to be SUPER careful in removing discs so you won't rip the packaging, so KEEP SMALL LITTLE FINGERS AWAY--the transfers themselves are gorgeous.  They are so clear that you can see the wires holding the Jupiter 2 as in flys around the derelect in the 2nd episode--something that would never be seen in the old NTSC format--and you can actually read all the controls!  It's kind of funny because now you can see that the ""Cosmic Sequencer"" or whatever really says ""AC FAN OFF/ON"" !  It's just a hoot to see things so absolutely clearly.  I have the first 5 episodes virtually memorized but this time I could see the fuse wire wrapped around the consoles prior to their shorting out and things like that.  The bonus disc has an episode in 5.1 stereo and 16x9 framing which is also a revelation.  I know there are those who are adamant about the original aspect ratio if 4x3, but seeing this episode (with it's potentially problematic extreme closeups) in 16x9 shows that the show can be presented in this format with virtually nothing lost.  The top and bottom cropping are what used to be called ""title safe"" in 4x3, so anything that had to be seen on the original broadcasts had to be within that parameter, and 16x9 fits ""title safe"" on the top and bottom.  I would love to have seen the 3rd episode, ""Island in the Sky"" with the crash sequence in 16x9!

Considering the show is 50 years old, and the transfers were from interpositives or CRI color internegatives made by Deluxe at the time the show was aired, the color is outstanding.  (I used to work at Fox, and we used to call it ""Pink by Deluxe"" because Deluxe color ALWAYS faded to pink after a few years.  They had to do huge restoration on STAR WARS because the negative was fading!)  So to see the colors on Lost In Space, especially the pastel uniforms, is another delight.  I never remember such a wild and bold color palate before, and it was truly trend-making at the time.  These transfers truly do justice to the color plotting of the show.  LIS went to the bold colors due to the success of another Fox show, BATMAN, and it was sort of a game of one-upmanship in the color department.

In all, KUDOS to all involved in this project.  They really did their research and dug up a ton of material.  The only thing they missed (which I have heard!) is a stereo alternate version of the season 1 main title.  But literally, that's about it.

Another wonderful addition are the original rushes from the Lydecker Effects Unit.  Many of the first season effects shots were actually shot in color, and to see the camera slates (and realize that the Jupiter 2 shots were shot anywhere from 80 to 160 frames per second (sound speed is 24 frames per second) lets you know some of the tricks involved--including shooting sideways!  It's remarkable that so much was done ""in camera"" and the results--especially the Jupiter 2 crash--have become iconic.  And now you can see the wires--not that that is a fault, but it just shows how incredibly GOOD these guys were at doing effects quickly and efficiently.

My only complaint is the packaging.  Something more than corn-flake box packaging would be better.",1445472000,55,3231,4.596858638743456
7329224,5,B0117Q3S3G,"I am not going to gloss over the picture and sound quality. This was done very well. What sucks are the cardboard box and the tri-folding disc insert cases that make getting the discs out damn to near impossible. The FOX people really screwed us with this horrible box and packaging. When it actually arrived, after months of anticipation, it came in a cardboard box by UPS that was not even shipping protected. If you used a knife or a blade to open the box, then you were cutting directly into the black box with The Robot on it. There was no bubble wrap of any kind. Just a brown cardboard box lying right against the box set itself. I am giving this five stars for the picture and sound only. One star for the cheap attempt of packaging the box set. The paper outer carton sucks. Mine was dinged up and the corners crushed upon opening. The BATTLESTAR GALACTICA card cardboard box set cases are how these should have been made. Each season could have had a regular blue case with extra plastic holders for each disc like the BATTLESTAR GALACTICA sets. This is piss-poor packaging at it's absolute worst! FOX CONNECT has lost a customer. I will never buy anything from them directly again. And this terrible box, the tri-folding sleeves, and the impossibility of getting the discs out -- I would have been better off buying this at BEST BUY to keep from having the outer box damaged. At least on the shelf at Best Buy it looks decent and damage-free on the outside. And, you may want to use rubber gloves to pull the discs out of the cases. The cardboard sleeves hang onto the discs like grim death. At least the rubber gloves will prevent severe fingerprinting on the surface of them. TERRIBLE PACKAGING!

7329226,5,B0117Q3S3G,"A big ""Thank You"" to all that were involved in putting this package together! Especially because of all of the ownership issues, legalities and such which I never knew of. This set was really done right. First off, the HD re-mastering is beyond anything I've ever expected to see. The details are incredible, and the vivid colors from the velour uniforms really are outstanding. As a kid, I always wanted Professor Robinson's 3rd season dirty pink/purple colored velour shirt. It is still a cool looking shirt. I wonder why they never made any velour shirts to sell to us fans like all of the other collectibles that are available?
Another great thing is the cast's commentaries on some of the episodes. They point out things that were happening during the filming and remember things that they even forgot about.
I haven't finished watching the episodes yet, nor have I finished with all of the extras, but so far, it is all pretty impressive!
Any Negatives? Well, like most other reviews, the packaging is ok. The graphics and extras are fine, but it is difficult to handle the Blu Ray discs. They are really tightly fitted into their cardboard slots. I had to get my daughter to remove them. All I did was buy some DVD cases and put all of the discs in them so they won't get scratched. Also, I was really hoping that the team would have picked maybe one episode from the 1st season and colorize it as an extra feature. ""Wish Upon a Star"", ""The Sky is Falling"" or ""War of the Robots"" would have been great. Sure would be interesting to see what those 1st season uniforms would look like in color, and even the planet set too.

The restoration process is virtually perfect, the picture is clear and rich enough for today's HDTVs, the sound is crisp and clear as well.
The two reasons I did not give this collection 5 stars was the far-from-cheap price and the inclusion of only an excerpt from ""Lost In Space Forever"" instead of the whole program.
It is truly unfortunate that people are down-rating this set based on the packaging. The box set is packaged in a space-saving, more environmentally-friendly manner as opposed to plastic library boxing, which would have made the set huge and ungainly to store.

7329250,5,B0117Q3S3G,"Lost In Space: The Complete Adventures is a massive, 18-Disc set of all 83 episodes of the science-fiction series that ran on CBS from 1965 to 1968. The spaceship Jupiter II was supposed to take the Robinson family on a five-year exploratory voyage to a planet in the Alpha Centauri star system. Dr. Zachary Smith (Jonathan Harris)  in the employ of an unnamed foreign government  sabotaged the control system but was then trapped aboard the ship when it took off. Smith was originally written as a thoroughly evil villain but evolved into an irksome, conceited foil who caused most of the episodes conflicts and provided comic relief. For the duration of the series, the Robinsons, Dr. Smith, and pilot Don West (Mark Goddard) were destined to wander through space, stopping on assorted planets in an attempt to find their way home.

The family were played by Guy Williams as Prof. John Robinson, June Lockhart as his wife, Maureen, and Billy Mumy (Will), Angela Cartwright (Penny), and Marta Kristen (Judy) as their children. The stories never tackled heavy themes or examined fully the shows dramatic potential, settling instead on simple tales laced with humor, monsters, and cliff- hanger endings in the style of old movie serials. A main attraction was Robot B-9, designed by the same man who designed Robby the Robot for the feature film Forbidden Planet (1956). Robot B-9, endowed with great strength and futuristic weaponry, displayed human characteristics and was often Dr. Smiths sidekick and partner in mischief.

Based loosely on Swiss Family Robinson, Lost In Space was produced in black and white during Season 1 and color in Seasons 2 and 3. In January, 1966, ABC programmed Batman opposite Lost In Space. To compete, Lost in Space adopted a campy style, with bright outfits, exaggerated action, and wild bad guys such as space cowboys, pirates, knights, vikings, wooden dragons, and Amazons introduced in ever more fantastic stories.

Bonus features in the Blu-ray set include new on-camera original cast interviews; original cast audio commentaries; Lost In Space: The Epilogue, a cast reunion performance of Billy Mumys unproduced 1980 script; two versions of the shows unaired pilot; Guy Williams screen test; CBS promo featuring Dick Van Dyke; TV spots; outtakes; 1973 Lost In Space animated special; 20th anniversary interview with producer Irwin Allen; the feature The Fantasy Worlds of Irwin Allen; and 1966 promotional interviews with Guy Williams, June Lockhart, and Jonathan Harris.",1442707200,,2509,5.2004950495049505
7329251,4,B0117Q3S3G,"Overall:

Lost in Space is one of my favorite shows of all times. I originally wrote this as a 3 Star but didn't have the heart to leave it there and after some deliberation upgraded the rating to a 4. Let me start by saying that the video quality and the audio are beautiful, an easy 5 star plus rating. You will be amazed at the clarity and detail and see so many things you've never been able to see before. The menus and navigation on the discs are quite attractive as well and cleverly borrow graphic elements from the opening credits combined with exciting scenes from the show that showcase the season... I really must say its one of the nicer menus I've seen on any set to date, but I may be a bit prejudiced due to my extreme fondness for the content.

Packaging:

The packaging is ""a complete disaster area"" which is a shame as the graphics are great. Getting discs in and out of the accordion-style cardboard foldout sleeve is actually a bit frightening at times. For example, I spent well over 5 minutes trying to safely coax disc 2 of season 1 out of the package. I was positive I was going to either wreck the disc or the tear the sleeve but after rotating the tiny edge I could get ahold of back and forth over and over it finally released.

Extras:

I haven't been through the entire set yet of course, but so far from what I've seen on Disc 1 the extras are a let down. Probably the thing I was most excited about was getting to see the premier again as originally broadcast. And while it was fun to see the bumpers that have been in mothballs all these decades, only two (TWO!) commercials were included and zero (ZERO!) CBS station identifications. There are more (but far from all of the) commercials for episode 2 but still no CBS station identifications which I find amazing. ""Seven Wonderful Nights"" hosted by Dick Van Dyke only being an except containing the intro and the Lost in Space portion seemed a bit stingy to me. It would have been much more meaningful (not to mention fun) to see how Lost in Space was presented in context with the other shows, did it get as much time as other shows, more, less, etc.

Overall:

Overall I recommend this set highly. The video/audio quality is spectacular. Just keep in mind the packaging is going to drive you crazy and the Extras may be not be all you hoped for.

Note: If you've been on the edge about upgrading to a 4K TV and a nice soundbar, now is the time. You'll really be able to appreciate both watching the remastered Lost in Space.",1442620800,5,2510,4.359743040685225
7329252,3,B0117Q3S3G,"I'm giving this set three for the content.  The packaging overall is terrible.  From what I have seen so far the entire set seems to have been rushed.  The Blu-rays themself seem very cheap.  Do not touch them cause they are horrible to clean.  When I first looked at them I thought they were cheap DVDs.  I compared them to other Blu-rays and they are not the quality you might expect from Blu-ray.  Also some of the discs take forever to load.  The edges of the discs are a bit.  I paid $129 for the set and in my opinion based on quality...$29 would have been the right price.  If you are not really careful, the cheap cardboard will tear.  Amazon offers Blu-ray cases that can hold six discs.  I recommend getting those cases and using the cardboard one for display.  I waited a long time for this set and find myself disappointed.  Rumor has it tho that there may be a set released where the episodes are in 1:78 widescreen.  I hope if they are released they will reconsider packaging.

7329255,5,B0117Q3S3G,"This set looks and sounds terrific. The audio pops from the speakers, the black and white episodes are clear and sharp, and the color episodes have a nice filmic grain.
Many people have complained about the packaging and shipping conditions. I received my set (standard version) from Amazon Canada via UPS. There was no damage to the packaging whatsoever. The outer box is thin, but no thinner than other sets in my collection. The contents flyer is attached to the box with spirit gum that removes easily and leaves no residue. The accordion, disk sleeves are difficult to negotiate, but I found that by using a soft cloth (like the kind used to clean eyeglasses), I was able to grasp both sides of the discs and remove them without leaving any finger marks or scratches. I found no other scratches or marks on the disks themselves.
Obviously I haven't had time to watch the full set, but I loaded every disk, played parts of episodes at random and fast-forwarded through the rest. No noticeable glitches or playback problems at all.
My two complaints are that the extra features are not subtitled and only a 5-minute segment of, Lost In Space Forever, is included.
In case you're wondering, the title of this review comes from the dialogue of an episode in Season 2. Ill let the true fans tell which one.",1442448000,6,1306,4.682608695652174
7329256,3,B0117Q3S3G,"I won't elaborate on the incredible picture upgrade and the multitude of bonus features - they are spectacular, and largely worth the investment.

My chief gripe is with the incredibly un-friendly, unusable packaging.  HOW and WHY did anybody at FOX think this was a good idea?  Sure, it's pretty, but it's flimsy.  Worse yet, it's damned near IMPOSSIBLE to get the Blu's out of these glossy nightmare-accordions on the first, second or even THIRD attempt without severe fingerprinting, possibly scratching the disc or ripping the pretty ultra-thin cardboard.  (Please resist the urge to break out the needle-nose pliers, as much as you'll want to.)

You've read it here before, and I will emphasize: The very FIRST thing you'll want to do is transplant these Blu's into some (any) other secure DVD/Blu storage cases.  For the moment, mine are living in 9 slim-line double DVD-cases, but this is only temporarily until I decide on a better alternative.  I don't expect FOX to admit any kind of fault here and re-issue far SUPERIOR packaging to those who want it (who WOULDN'T?), but I'd love to see them reimburse us for the thousands of alternate cases we'll be using.

ALSO: Check your Blu's CAREFULLY under a strong light while transplanting.  Sure, Blu's have a tough-ish scratch-proof coating (and Blu-Ray players have much-advanced error-correction compared to DVD units) but it's still possible for a damaged Blu to screw up your day.  Out of 18 Blu's, I considered myself lucky to find only 1 suspect disc, which I'll have to watch end-to-end tonight to satisfy my piece of mind.  I'm not screaming ""RETURN"" just yet - who knows if a replacement set would be in any better condition?

But, I did find many discs covered in somebody else's fingerprints (FOX, buy your Blu production employees some fecking gloves, and make them WEAR them!)  Fortunately, these wiped off easily with a lightly daubed microfiber.

And to Amazon's credit (BTW, I pre-ordered in August and got the $129 price), they actually got the set here using sturdier-than-usual packaging materials,  with NO exterior UPS-induced damage or crushing, which has been the rule rather than the exception for me lately.

FINAL NOTE TO ANY SUITS AT FOX WHO MAY BE TUNING IN:  I can't speak for everyone, but personally... I would have GLADLY traded the replica script, the postcards and the art-deco robot blueprint for USABLE, FINGER FRIENDLY packaging.  This fancy, glossy flimsy packaging fiasco is a complete fail... FOX should be ASHAMED of treating this landmark series in such a dismal fashion... and both the packaging designers and the suits who signed off on this one should be fired.  You screwed up.  And most of us are far from happy about it, especially at the price we paid.",1442448000,32,2758,4.952173913043478
7329257,5,B0117Q3S3G,"Yeah the box it comes in is cheap but they probably had to look for some way to save money on making this thing -- otherwise it's pretty stupendous and they certainly spared no expenses in giving us this gift. Seeing Lost in Space in it's best possible quality is mind-blowing. Of course the show doesn't do for me what it did when I was a kid - I definitely find myself at my current age wanting to see more depth to the show but for nostalgia's sake of re-living a classic 60's sci-fi show, this box set is all that you could want and more. Kevin Burns is the man who made all of this happen and although I have never met Mr. Burns I've been hearing people talk about him in fan circles for 25 years. How a Lost in Space fan ended up working at 20th Century Fox is beyond serendipity. I was really impressed by Mr. Burns' commentary track on ""Reluctant Stowaway"" - he's a passionate fan but also a brilliant producer.",1442448000,3,919,4.2272727272727275
7329258,3,B0117Q3S3G,"Much as I love this series, I'm so VERY disappointed that this new blu ray collection is not 16:9 resolution. I have to stare at black bars on the left and right sides. Yes, I know this is a 50-year old series. But since they call it ""HD"" it should fill up a modern HD TV screen. At least give me the option to toggle back and forth and choose my resolution. If that's not possible, they could easily have made two versions, one a 4:3 and one a 16:9, and let the buyer choose.

The video itself is very clear and the sound is great too. The packaging is squirrely though, it's hard to get each disc out of the cardboard wrapper. All in all it's a nice purchase, better than the DVD set since it takes up half as many discs and shelf space, but I just can't get excited about having to watch a blu ray with black bars on the sides.",1442448000,,830,4.03030303030303
7329259,4,B0117Q3S3G,"The show looks perfect on Blu-ray, no complaints whatsoever with that. The packaging on the other hand is ridiculous! The discs are in cardboard sleeves that are so tight, you will absolutely rip them trying to remove the discs. You will also scratch the discs as well as getting your fingerprints all over them. I've experienced this with a number of boxed Blu-ray sets over the last few years. Maybe it's for environmental reasons, or maybe it's because it costs less to make them, the bottom line is - they don't put plastic DVD holders in most of the box-sets anymore. It really sucks because people that buy boxed-sets, especially when it's an entire series, are collectors and they like to keep their collections pristine and perfect. There's no way to do that with this type of packaging and this Lost In Space set is by far the worst of them all.",1442361600,12,854,4.625
7329260,1,B0117Q3S3G,"The LIS series, transfers and extras are top notch.  However, the packaging is abysmal. Trying to get the discs out from their accordion cardboard sleeves is a chore and the discs wind up with fingerprints. Over time these cardboard sleeves will surely rip.  On top of that, the box itself is super thin cardboard with a flip top.  Not sure why Fox would design anything like this.  I hope they will offer new replacement packaging soon that is more consumer friendly.  This was the perfect set marred by poor packaging and no digital downloads.  The new Ultimate James Bond Collection Blu Ray Amazon Exclusive got the packaging right. Why not do something like that?

Just to be clear.  This is a fantastic set worth every penny.  It's simply the clunky packaging that I am writing about.",1442361600,31,789,4.742647058823529

7329264,3,B0117Q3S3G,"First off I must be honest, I am not an avid LOST IN SPACE fan, but a fan nonetheless.  I watched reruns as a kid and possibly even saw some during their original air when I was a wee toddler. Hearing the countdown and theme always sent a thrill through me as a kid and all those colors and odd things to take in.  What kid could not like a series with a robot?  So, I never bought the DVD sets, rented some, but never purchased.  I decided with the new BluRay box set of the complete series through FoxDirect for $99, good deal, I'll bite.  Now I just received my box set from FoxDirect, and it was dinged on the corners of the box itself. :(  The outside box is made of cheap cardboard (you know the thickness of cereal boxes? That's the stuff. Awful).  So already it looked like a used set out of the shipping box.  Each season is housed in a fold out accordion style cardboard sleeves where the discs are tucked in (this makes many folks angry as the discs can get easily scratched when pulling them in and out of the cardboard). The set of oversized full color character cards are.. large and kinda cool.  There is a foldout blueprint of the Robot, mkay. Above all the extras listed are plentiful and if the show looks better than the DVD sets (and they looked good!) then it was all worth it. Just wanted those that care to know what the box and materials themselves were like, physically.",1442275200,58,1395,4.273764258555133

7329266,5,B0117Q3S3G,"In the fall of 1976 I first laid eyes on the Sony Betamax. When I did there was only one thought in my mind ""I need this machine to record Lost in Space for my very own!"" Two years passed till I had enough money to purchase a Betamax (SL-8200) but by then my local channel had stoped showing it. Three more years passed til I found it on TBS. The broadcast quality was poor but after another year and a half of recording Sunday broadcasts, I had it. The poor quality of the episodes combined with the loss of resolution from the vcr started a compulsive quest to obtain better quality recordings. After re-recording in Beta-HiFi, then ED Beta (from much improved copies shown on USA), then imported Laserdiscs, followed by those horrible DVDs, Last nights arrival of the BluRay set has ended that quest. Not because I am finally broke but because finally, I have the entire series in crystal clear pristine quality, oh the joy, the joy!
Yes they are that good and must have been transferred from some of the most original material available. My first test episodes were ""Collision of Planets"", ""The Anti-Matter Man"" and ""Condemed of Space"" from the third season. All I can say is PERFECT, PERFECT, PERFECT! It brought a tear to my eye to realize that I have not ever seen these episodes in such clarity, not even when originally broadcast. Sad that many of the cast members are gone and will never be able to see the show in it's new glory. A tip of the hat to all those involved in putting together shows during that period of such high quality, then filming it on 35mm where full appreciation of the films true resolution would not be realized for half a century! True work and dedication from all involved for something that most must have presumed would fade away after five or ten years at most. thanks to us very loyal fans, the cast, Sheila Mattews Allen and others this little gem of a series that meant so much to us children of the space age has now been preserved in all it's glory.
To any and all sitting on the fence worried about another poor transfer, forget it! Leap off that fence and order immediately, you will not regret it!",1442275200,9,2144,4.471938775510204

7329269,5,B0117Q3S3G,"First let me say this not so much a review of the Blu-Ray disc set ( I have not seen it yet) but my feelings about ""Lost In Space"" the TV series in general and the fact that this fully restored version is finally going to be released. I have been waiting for this for about 2 years. Every since I first heard about this project and then the teaser they put on YouTube a while back, I was there!!! They had me the first second of the video. As of the writing of this review I am 60 years young. I remember fondly watching the teaser trailer they ran for a month or two before the show aired. I was so there. I was about 10 years old. I was already into Sci-Fi. I loved Fireball XL5, Thunderbirds and any 50's Sci-Fi movie reruns on TV. Lost in Space was the first TV show of it's kind that pushed all my buttons. Now that is one layer of my love for this series. Then I did not get to see it again until the Sci-Fi channel started showing reruns, I guess it was sometime in the 90's. I set my VHS recorder to watch it 2 times all the way through.
It was then that I started seeing another layer of the show that as a kid I did not pickup on. I know the show by todays standards is considered cheesy, with the ultimate happening with ""The Great Vegetable Rebellion"" which I absolutely love. One of the things I love is how the show morphed from one thing to another. After about the 3 or 4 episodes the producers and writers started to see there just was not any chemistry between the husband and wife, older daughter, and the navigator/pilot. So they started to write more for Dr. Smith (Jonathan Harris) Will Robinson (Billy Mumy) and the Robot. Jonathan Harris being the seasoned actor that he was, could see that his part was going to be killed off, decided to make the part his own. Ignoring input from Irwin Allen, he made the part more lovable than villain. Mainly because he wanted a steady pay check. Talk about surviving in the cut throat world of Hollywood. I literally could give a 2 hour lecture on all the behind the scenes stuff that went on, but there are already several books written and interviews about all that stuff.
If you have a 4k TV with surround sound home theater set up this will be the ultimate experience. We finally will be able to see it as the producers would have wanted us to see it if the technology for the delivery to your house had been there. (I am not one of the purist people who believe that it is sacrilegious to show it any other way than 4.3 aspect ratio). I want to see the fully restored 35mm film elements in all of it's almost widescreen glory, the way God intended. I know a lot of work has gone into making this and it is worth every penny.
Lets face it, no one has yet seen Lost In Space restored to this level of detail. I have the DVD box set which was made from the 1 inch video tape, and it looks pretty good but just will not compare to this version.
I hope more and more TV show from the sixties and seventies could have this same treatment. I have seen Hogan's Heroes done this same way and it is just like watching something that was made yesterday, it is that good. I believe they were showing it on HDNET some time back.
It just goes to show you that when they were making these TV shows using 35mm film they sure knew what they were doing, it was the HD of it's day. It's a shame no one was able to watch it that way back then. I guess it gives people like me something to live for...",1441584000,,3447,4.123328380386329
7329270,4,B0117Q3S3G,"The 60's had a moment where a whole mess of science fiction shows came out. Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, Land of the Giants, The Time Tunnel and Lost in Space were part of that pseudo-renaissance and Irwin Allen was the brainchild behind them. Of these the show that had the most lasting impression was Lost in Space. It was pure science fiction candy for the whole family. You had a flying saucer, a cool robot, a whole rogue's gallery of aliens. What's there not to like as a kid? While the show isn't exactly high brow like The Twilight Zone it did serve to fill that sense of wonderment and adventure. There have been lots of video releases for Lost in Space, but this one can be considered the best of the best.

Lost in Space is about the Robinson family suffering sabotage on their mission to get to Alpha Centauri. The saboteur, Dr. Smith, becomes a stowaway on the mission and both caused and saved the Robinson family a whole heap of trouble. On the first season they crash land on a planet, and while they fix their spaceship lots of adventures pop up. This first season is widely regarded the best of the series as it had a more serious tone. The second season has the spaceship repaired, but eventually crash lands again on another planet (it seems planet-side adventures meant cheaper sets). This season brought the show from black and white to color, and Irwin Allen decided to add more humor and camp to the series in an attempt to replicate the success from the new Batman series. Dr. Smith has become a bumbling comic relief and the shows focus turns to him and his interactions with the robot and young Will Robinson. The third season finally got everybody off a planet and into space with regular visits to different planets. The campy stylings stayed with the show along with nods to current fashion trends.

You are getting a completely digitally remastered copy of every Lost in Space episode along with a massive score of extra content that equates to more than seven hours of bonus material. The original 35mm film elements were remastered to HDCamSR (a high definition digital medium that has film stored at a full 1080p) and the audio was restored from the original magnetic sound elements into an English 1.0 Mono DTS-HD Master Audio (I'm glad they didn't try to simulate surround sound). That means you finally get to see the show in high definition with the best quality sound possible.

When I say you get a ton of extras I mean it. Some exclusive extras were produced by Bill Mumy. Here is a list:

Commentaries - Bill Mumy, Mark Goddard, Angela Cartwright, Marta Kristen and Mike Clark provide commentaries on eight episodes.

On-Camera Interviews - Interviews with original cast members Bill Mumy, Mark Goddard, Angela Cartwright, Marta Kristen, Guy Williams Jr. & Toni Williams

20th Anniversary Interview with Irwin Allen - This was shot back in 1985, and was never released to the public... until now.

""No Place to Hide"" - This is the original un-aired pilot episode used to pitch the show to CBS. Fans will notice a few changes from the series premier (notably the absence of Dr. Smith and the robot). You get both the long version and short version (I believe the short version is what was broadcast in 1997 with time condensed in the opening and closing sequences/credits).

Original CBS Network Versions of Original Episodes - These episodes are The Reluctant Stowaway, The Derelict, The Magic Mirror, Follow the Leader, Blast off into Space and Target Earth

The Fantasy Worlds of Irwin Allen - This full length documentary was made in 1996 and is a tribute to Irwin Allen and his contributions to film and television. Running at about 90 minutes this feature covers much more than just Lost in Space. It is loaded with show footage and archival footage with Allen as well as interviews with Jonathan Harris, Bob May, Harry Harris, Ernest Borgnine, Faye Dunaway, Barbara Eden, Al Lewis, Roddy McDowell and much more. Hosted by Bill Mumy and June Lockhart.

Lost in Space Memories - These are program interstitials for The Fantasy Worlds of Irwin Allen. Interstitials are small programs used to fill in space in case the scheduled program runs short of its time slot.

Lost in Space Forever - This isn't the full television special that aired in 1998. Just the portion with Dr. Smith, Robot and Will Robinson in that last five minutes. It's a shame the entire special isn't in here, however this is the very last time you see a performance with these three actors together.

Lost in Space: The Epilogue - Bill Mumy wrote a script in 1980 that was never produced. Now you get to see it performed by Bill Mumy, Mark Goddard, Marta Kristen, Angela Cartwright, Veronica Cartwright, Guy Williams Jr., Toni Williams, Kevin Burns and Robot B9.

Guy Williams Screen Test - Original test footage of Guy's Lost in Space audition from 1964.

Bob May's Home Movies - Bob was the actor that played the robot, but didn't voice the robot. These are film recordings he took back in 1965.

Original Dick Strout Fox Promotional Interviews - Interviews with Jonathan Harris, June Lockhart and Guy Williams from 1966.

Interview with Jonathan Harris and Al Lewis - This was from the Chicago radio show MANCOW

Lost in Space Animated Series Pilot - A Hanna-Barbera production that was proposed for the 1973 television season. It's very different from the original series, and only Jonathan Harris and his character, Dr. Smith (along with the robot, now called Robon in a different configuration) were in this series. Obviously it never got picked up. This is the first time the animation has been released.

Johnathan Harris: Never Fear, Smith is Here - An A&E Biography special that aired in 2002 that cover's Harris' acting career pre and post Lost In Space. This is a hard to find special and it's great to see it on this collection.

""Lost in Space"" Animated Series Pitch - There was a second attempt at an animated series presented by Scott O'Brien back in 2003. It's a fan-made test film that tried to generate new interest in reviving the series. The use of the original series soundtrack was a nice touch.

Outtakes - These are special effects outtakes taken throughout the entire series. Some rare music outtakes as well.

Season Two Main Title - This is with theme music scored by Warren Barker. Barker was originally signed on to do the music, but was later replaced. Here is what you would have heard if that didn't happen.

Promotional footage - Presentations for advertisers, promotional plugs (including one with Dick Van Dyke and bumper promos with Jonathan Harris and the Robot), commercials for original series and syndication, and radio promotions from the 90's.

The Ballad of William Robinson - This is a music video by Bill Mumy, who has had experience in the medium with his involvement with experimental group Barnes and Barnes.

Photo Gallery - Extensive collection of publicity stills, episode stills, behind-the-scenes stills, images of vintage merchandise, props, and various artwork.

The box set has 18 disks stored in three separate cases (one for each season). Each season has a foldout loaded with images and flashy 60's sci-fi style graphics that tells you what episodes are on each disc along with a quick story synopsis. You also get a mini-blueprint of the robot and a mini-reproduction of the shooting script for the episode The Reluctant Stowaway. There are two versions of this collection, and both have the exact same features on the inside. The only real difference is this case is a regular bookshelf style box while the other has a three dimensional molding of the robot on the front that sticks out more. This release is $10 cheaper, which seems like a good buy for me (I prefer my box sets to fit with the rest of my movie collection shelf anyway). Lost in space is a classic, and this collection is the absolute best way to enjoy it.",1440547200,16,7905,4.756756756756757
7329271,4,B0117Q3S3G,"Irwin Allen made a number of memorable science fiction television shows in the 60's. However none of them have stood the test of time or influenced the genre as much as Lost in Space. The Complete Adventures is exactly as it's advertised you get all three seasons in this collection as well as both the long and short version of the un-aired pilot, all six CBS network episode variants, and tons of other extras. The original 35mm film elements were remastered to HDCamSR (a high definition digital medium that has film stored at a full 1080p) and the audio was restored from the original magnetic sound elements into an English 1.0 Mono DTS-HD Master Audio. All 83 episodes and over seven hours of bonus material all on 18 disks. There is a massive amount of extras on this collection. Almost everything that can be found related to the show.

Lost in Space is about the Robinson family embarking on a historic space colonization mission when they are sabotaged by Dr. Zachary Smith, who inadvertently became a stow away on the ship, the Jupiter 2. As luck would have it he ends up saving the Robinson family to save his own skin, but the ship is now damaged and (you guessed it...) lost in space. The first season has the ship stranded on a planet while the Robinson family have various adventures and Dr. Smith ends up becoming comic foil as opposed to villain. The second season the Jupiter 2 is repaired, but eventually crash lands on a second planet with even crazier adventures focusing more on Dr. Smith's antics with young Will Robinson and the famously quoted (""Danger Will Robinson!"") B-9 robot. The third season has the ship finally visit other worlds and added new vehicles to the show's canon.

All in all many people prefer the first season over the rest of the series as it's the season that focused more on action, adventure and held a slightly more serious tone that captivated the entire family. The second and third season changed the focus to make the show more endearing towards the kids, but not the adults. While the series had a very high production budget compared to other shows in that time the special effects, and props do become Still this series captured the imaginations of many, and did help spawn such science fiction genre stereotypes like a robot comic relief, funny aliens, and brave, gifted child heroes.

7329277,5,B0117Q3S3G,"As a lifelong fan of Irwin Allen's ""LOST IN SPACE"" TV series,i can truly say that it's finally about time,that a special BluRay DVD set,commemorating
the show's 50th anniversary,is coming out-finally!! for true,die hard fans of the 1965-68 CBS series,""LOST IN SPACE"" continues to thrill and entertain
another new generation of fans and viewers,since debuting on Wednesday night,Sept. 15,1965 on CBS,following ""THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES""-and from there,it's been an amazing adventure! i know that the show had very comedic and comical qualities,that have made it a target,mostly by that,of the ""START TREK"" crowd,and it's also understandable,since CBS rejected ""STAR TREK"" over ""LOST IN SPACE"",after Gene Roddenberry had tried to pitch and sell ""The Cage"" TV pilot to them,,but obviously they (CBS) favored Irwin Allen's pilot,and what a pilot,indeed! but in actuality,both of these great shows are still classics,although they were rivals from other networks-that's show business! but LOST IN SPACE fans will NOT be disappointed by this collector's set,which many of us,have waited for decades to come out! even included in this collection,is the ABC ""SATURDAY SUPERSTAR MOVIE""
second season opener,""LOST IN SPACE"",which Hanna-Barbera Productions made in Australia,and using Jonathan Harris' likeness and voice,as ""Dr Smith""-if many back then remembered,Fall 1973 on Saturday morning TV was unique,because most of the cartoon line-up that Fall on the networks,were animated shows,based on popular TV shows of the 60s,begining with ""STAR TREK"",that went on to win an Emmy Award for Best Children's program! but the success of ""LOST IN SPACE"" was not diminished,as it continued it's thriving run in syndication over the 50 years it's been on the air! this set also includes RARE CBS promos,along with actual episodes,as they were broadcast,while on CBS-TV,during those fantastic Wednesday nights,,making this collection,worth it's weight in gold! this collector's set,is only for THE most serious and committed LIS fans out there,and it certainly won't be a disappointment! now if Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment can also put the remaining Irwin Allen shows onto BluRay sets like this,,then it would indeed be worth all the money! their previous releases of the other three Irwin Allen shows in 2006-2009,was highly disappointing,because they put these
shows onto the extremely CHEAP MultiDisc formats,which made all of them looked burned! i have complained about that,with little resolve,,but the release of the ""LOST IN SPACE"" BluRay Box set will certainly make-up for previous disappointments! BUY THIS SET,,it'll be worth the money!!",1439078400,4,2642,5.64070351758794
7329278,5,B0117Q3S3G,"It is almost funny that we are all reviewing this before the release but we KNOW what we are going to get.  From the mouth of the makers we know about all the great bonus features and extras, we know the episodes are all wonderful and entertaining and we also know that the quality in Blu-ray is going to be far superior to the old VHS tapes and even the regular DVD's we already have.  I cannot wait for September 15.  Thank you...powers that be...for deciding to make these available to the public! I did not mean to imply that we are reviewing without knowledge.  We already know about the special features...the commentaries on some of the episodes and the  new material.  The extra material is almost reason enough to want this.  I cannot wait to receive but I do already know a lot about what i am getting.",1438905600,2,812,4.409395973154362

8723739,5,B0117Q3S3G,"Fantastic video restoration! Youve never seen so much detail or boldness of color in LiS before. Great black depth and shadow detail. I just cant overstate how good this looks, even on a 65 OLED that exposes every flaw. Infinately better than on TV in the 70sIm tempted to say it looks too good for 60s syndicated television, its such a shocking difference from what I remember growing up. This restoration is every bit as good as what was done the the original Star Trek and Batman TV series.

Lots of bonus videos round out the series and actors, and the included paraphanelia are nice touches. The packaging is very attractive. Well worth the purchase and I would buy again.

One detraction that I just don't have the heart to take a full star away for (even though I probably should), I do agree with others that its tricky getting the discs out of the cardboard slipcase. Have to be very careful not to tear the cardboard. Otherwise a wonderful blast back to the past!",1533168000,,973,4.554285714285714

8723744,2,B0117Q3S3G,"no doubt, the serie itself is worth 5 stars. But I asked myself what kind of bubblehead designed the packing. It is all in glazed board, all seems very heartly made. But unfortunately little practical. It is almost impossible to remove the disks from the cover without damaging either the disc or the packing itself. In order to make things worse, none of the discs of season 1 did play. I tried 3 players, 2 code free and one region A/1. No chance, the playing stoped during the episode and did not play further. I requested replacement. If everythings works, I will give 4 stars for the product, One I must maintain subtracted because of the unfunctional packing.",1528243200,,665,4.6440677966101696
8723745,5,B0117Q3S3G,"This series [TV-Series 1965-1968] is formulated on the old serial cliff-hangers. The stages are cardboard and Styrofoam. The props look like anything lying around in the ware house. From the dialog you would not realize that the actors can and are acting. As the programs progress the stories get weirder to holds your attention. There are also several notable guests including Robbie the Robot that always outsmarts ""The Robot"" (Bob May) The Robot's voice is Dick Tufeld.

We all know the basic story of a saboteur Dr. Zachary Smith (Jonathan Harris) is too smart for his own good and his sabotage backfires from the start throwing the spaceship into who knows where with him trapped inside. What is worse is he never learns from episode to episode. Prof. John Robinson (Guy Williams) is the good guy father that is always giving one hope of being found or getting back. Maureen Robinson (June Lockhart) is the stereotypical motherly type and is caught occasionally stopping John from beating Zackary's brains out. We have mischievous kids always wandering off to discover the new trouble. And a watered down love interest between daughter Judy (Marta Kristen) and Major Don West (Mark Goddard).

How will they survive?
What strange creature or disaster will befall them this week?

Some one may have modified the media somewhat. ""Oh, the pain, the pain."" However we buy what we can.",1527465600,,1384,4.982683982683983
