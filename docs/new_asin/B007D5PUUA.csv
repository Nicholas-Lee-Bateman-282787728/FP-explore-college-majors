8514894,5,B007D5PUUA,"Sifu Ken Gullette reveals the secrets behind the powerfully devastating Hsing-I Animal Style Forms.

It's very rare to find a DVD that teaches the 12 Animal Hsing-I forms, and it's even rarer to find one
that actually breaks down each and every move.

The 12 Animals DVD builds on the skills learned in the Hsing-I Five Fist Postures and
Linking Fist DVDs.

The great thing about this DVD and all American Tao videos is that they are designed as the ultimate learning tool. It's like having a Master Sifu right in the room with you teaching you the forms.

To the naysayers who say you can't learn from a DVD, I would say you haven't studied from
an American Tao Video.

Granted, it is great to have personal instruction, in certain areas it is very hard to come across
schools that teach Hsing-I.

When you are ready to learn the 12 Animal Forms, buy this DVD!",1373068800,6,861,4.487179487179487
