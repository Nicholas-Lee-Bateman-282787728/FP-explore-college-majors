8449902,2,B004ZJ9VUC,"I have to agree with the other reviewers concerning this dvd collection. I am a true Mill Creek fan (America's 60 Greatest Unsolved Mysteries/Crimes being my favorite) but this one was a bit disappointing. The first installment of Disc #1 (the Lloyd Pye lecture) was way too long, and quite frankly, (being supported by only a slide show) was very boring. I kept expecting to have to take a test at the end. The remaining 6 documentaries are more like lengthy interviews rather than in-depth explorations prepared by Mill Creek. Some of the reenactments and opinions are interesting but on the whole, this collection did not live up to expectation. All of these programs seem to contain a lot of unnecessary information and filler (the 2 most guilty of this are the Billy Meier segment and the Crop Circle piece).They also tend to be way, way too long and stray into tangents unrelated to the documentary. The only saving grace was that the price was very reasonable.",1521417600,,967,4.796407185628743
8449903,1,B004ZJ9VUC,If you collect everything ufo then get this. I for one was disappointed in this offering. Lots of lecturing and a travel or two with a man in a cowboy hat and oilcoat and cowboy boots (in England) that turns out to be...well...inconclusive. Ill never get those few hours back. Sad production overall.,1455580800,2,300,4.679245283018868
8449904,2,B004ZJ9VUC,"this starts out much the same as another mill creek title: aliens, abductions &  extraordinary sightings. disc 1 title 1 starts out with a poor quality recording of a Lloyd Pye lecture for auforn. two hours of him talking will challenge your sleep avoidance. many dubious claims made. other titles are older TV style produced documentaries. some are recordings of interviews. have to dig a little to find something compelling here amongst the titles",1448582400,2,449,5.0675675675675675

8449906,3,B004ZJ9VUC,"This is a comprehensive collection of 7 documentaries, each a little different, but all exploring unexplained encounters.  It's a heavy dose, not to be administered in one sitting, I think.  If you're interested in the subject, there's a great deal of raw material here and a lot to think about, some of it disturbing.  I like the authenticity of much of this.

Ancient Aliens is a lecture by Lloyd Pye which postulates that we in fact did not evolve from the apes, nor did God create us, but rather, we are in fact, aliens.  Tough to prove, but Pye tries.

Messages from Outer Space - This is about Billy Meier, who claims he's been having close encounters since 1942.  Believe it or don't, it's fascinating stuff.

Crop Circles Revealed -  This one's worth it for the aerial shots of crop circles alone--like a tour through the museum of crop circles.  What they are, I still don't know.

UFO Enigma - Maybe the weakest of the set, mostly speculation, kind of a ""thought-piece"" on UFOs, occultism, etc.

Alien Contact is an extended interview with Terry Le Riche Walters, a reluctant victim of alien abductions.

UFO Crashes UK is a reminder that not all alien sightings are in the desert Southwest of the USA.

Crop Circles, UFOs and the Paranormal is exactly what it says.",1321056000,4,1276,4.663677130044843
8449907,2,B004ZJ9VUC,"I respect Mill Creek Entertainment. They have produced one of the best documentary I have ever seen ( America's 60 greatest Unsolved mysteries and crimes ) and other very good documentaries ( America's Serial Killers Portraits in Evil, Las Vegas: The City the Mob Made ). They don't have a big budget but they still know how to produce good DVDs....well, most of the time.

This DVD was a huge disappointment. Some of the documentaries included in this DVD are good but nothing really stand out as being a ""must-own"" documentary. Basically it's people being interviewed for 9 Hours. There's some alleged UFOs footages and pictures here and there but most of the time you'll watch a bunch of people ( some of them well known and credible like Nick Pope and Timothy Good, some you may have never seen before ) talking about their theories about UFOs and talking about their favorite cases, etc. This DVD is better that Mill Creek's previous DVD about UFOs, ""Aliens, Abductions and Extraordinary Sightings"" but I was expecting a lot more.

If you want to buy a very good DVD set about UFOs buy the Unsolved Mysteries: UFOs set or the History Channel's UFOs and Aliens set. This DVD set is not horrible, it's ok, but most UFO buff will be disappointed by it. Just don't expect to learn something new, all the topics discussed in this set have been available on the web for a long time. But if you want to buy it just to have one more set about UFOs and Aliens then go for it, at least the DVD is affordable ( less than 10$ ).",1312848000,6,1521,4.487364620938628
