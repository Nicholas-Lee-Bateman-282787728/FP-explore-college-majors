The techniques are as compellingly powerful as they appear, creating a mute internal snapping sound referred to as ""thunder power"" by Sifu. It is unfortunate that the application section in the video does not show more of Liu sifu's many techniques and combinations, which are at once dizzyingly fast and terminal. There is no chin-na in Feeding Crane, just brutal dislocation and/or breakage of joints (wrists, elbow, shoulder, neck, knee, etc). I can vouch for Liu sifu's amazing power and internal control.",1283558400,,638,4.97196261682243
7889420,5,6305434174,"""For secrets are edged tools ,
And must be kept from children and from fools""
John Dryden 1631-1700
As the editor of the second largest martial arts magazine in North America (Dragon Times) I am always amused by  ""experts"" (in this case an anonymous viewer from California) who criticize subjects beyond their comprehension and in doing so reveal the depth of their ignorance for the amusement of us all.
Clearly our ""expert"" was unaware that ""White Crane"" is a term that covers a numbers of  boxing styles from Southern China based on the movements of the crane of which Feeding Crane is the most sophisticated. As far as ""not looking like the White Crane Style style than Yang Jwing Ming promotes"" this is hardly surprising as it is a completely different art. The name really should have been a clue.
This video program received the highest ratings from The Library Journal and Dragon Times. Author Liu Chang I is the Chairman of the Feeding Crane Assn. of Taiwan and the Grandson of Liu Guo, one of the most respected Chinese boxers of the 20th century. The Liu family are so highly regarded that they have been commissioned by the Government of mainland China to reintroduce Feeding Crane boxing into Fuchow province, its birthplace.
Clearly our anonymous critic was not knowledgeable enough to understand what he saw and heard in the video. This is fortunate for secrets are edged tools and really should be kept from fools.

7889421,5,6305434174,"If you practice Okinawan Karate, or southern White Crane Gung Fu, this video belongs in your collection!  Liu Chang I does an incredible job of demonstrating the many applications of individual moves.  The influence of  White Crane Gung Fu on Okinawan Karate is obvious.  I have studied this  video on countless viewings, and am amazed that I can still get something  new out of it every time.  Now if we can only get Tsunami Productions to  put out Volumes 2,3,4...etc.!!!",924998400,3,473,4.825
