6934169,1,B00RPOPPPY,The DVD freezes up and at times it will also skip I tried other dvds to see if maybe there was a problem with the player but that was the only DVD that I had a problem with,1458432000,3,172,3.5526315789473686
6934170,4,B00RPOPPPY,Not as good as the first one but still highly recommended,1445904000,2,57,4.2727272727272725
6934171,4,B00RPOPPPY,"If you're interested in this for the same reason that I took note of it, I hope you'll find this a helpful review.  Basically this movie is as explicit as you could hope for, but there seem to be some edits sooner than I would like and while the picture is acceptable (and letterboxed), it's not great even for DVD.  I'm not sure what ""digitally remastered"" on the cover really means in terms of improved experience.  Still, even with the slight pixelization it didn't look too bad on a 39"" screen... and I even played with my 2x and 3x zoom a bit.

As for the graphic content, this is easily as graphic as the original Caligula including fully visible fellatio and cunnilingus, fully visible penetration (both from full-body distance and from close-up), and fully visible ejaculation, particularly in the orgy scene in the middle.  There's even a bit of horse play, a big babe manually works it and that is graphically depicted, although the full bestial part is only implied.  I got the impression that there was even more to the orgy scene that they didn't show - it's as if that could have gone on another 5 minutes with two more couples going at it but they decided to cut it... which was a bit of a letdown.  Still, in some ways it felt like they were mirroring the first movie but going just a bit further, which was nice to see.

I haven't watched the full movie for the storyline and acting yet, but my impression is that at least the sets and costumes were interesting and of course there is plenty of the other kinds of awful stuff that Caligula got up to (violence and whatnot).  Admittedly this isn't a true sequel and lacks the powerhouse of real actors (such as Helen Mirren and Malcolm McDowell) from the first movie... but it's at least somewhat congruent for what it is.",1442793600,56,1788,4.493827160493828
6934172,4,B00RPOPPPY,I love it,1436832000,,9,2.3333333333333335
6934173,5,B00RPOPPPY,Possibly more rude and graphic that Pt. 1....uh.,1491782400,5,48,5.125
6934174,3,B00RPOPPPY,A tacky low budget  sexcapade with no it and the actors constantly  slipping,1487808000,,76,4.769230769230769
6934175,5,B00RPOPPPY,"Highly recommended. Incredible imagery and kept me to the end. Definitely loved the orgy scenes although they omitted the lesbian pool. Some blood and gore but just what you would expect from a movie called Caligula. I didn't think Laura Gemser was the main character in this, so if it's her you want to see, you'd be disappointed. Overall, it fulfills every depraved thought. The filming was decent quality also.",1486425600,10,413,4.914285714285715
6934176,5,B00RPOPPPY,"I am thoroughly enjoying this video, and I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in what proved to be Rome's worst and most diabolical emperor.",1485216000,5,160,4.75
6934177,2,B00RPOPPPY,The director wasted Laura Gemser's good looks and talent. I wouldn't recommend it to my friends - even if they liked 1980's cable tv.,1482969600,,133,4.583333333333333
6934178,1,B00RPOPPPY,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME. Not even the sex scenes were worth it.,1475193600,,70,4.071428571428571
6934179,5,B00RPOPPPY,"Made in the wake of the big-budget Tinto Brass film, CALIGULA, this isn't a sequel so much as another retelling of the famed emperor. Made on a fraction of the budget that CALIGULA had, CALIGULA 2 is almost as entertaining, but just as compelling! The DVD available from Mutant Sorority is the complete and uncut version clocking in at 125 minutes! Presented in wide-screen with dubbed English (with some scenes in Italian with subtitles) soundtrack, this transfer is quite clear and probably the best we'll ever see. All of the sex and violence intact, this is as explicit as you've always heard it to be!",1473552000,19,606,4.780952380952381
6934180,4,B00RPOPPPY,"This is, to my surprise, a hard core movie.  Transfer is not good enough.  Laura Gemser becomes the Queen and she is stabbed to death on bed unexpectedly.
This movie has scenes combining group sex as in Caligula 1, underwater playing and horse masturbation in Emmanuelle in America.
Those two movies are also X rated.",1468627200,4,317,4.745454545454545
6934181,1,B00RPOPPPY,The 'plot' is disjointed and makes little sense.  The acting is poor.  Laura Geyser doesn't even try to act.  Then the mish-mash of sub-mediocrity takes a time out for pure XXX porn.  That isn't very well done either.,1463529600,4,217,4.631578947368421
6934182,5,B00RPOPPPY,Another interesting movie about the notorious emperor but the first one w/ Hellen Mirren was much better. I highly recommend you buy both films. Truly a collectors' item and you won't regret it.,1462147200,6,194,4.909090909090909
8695701,1,B00RPOPPPY,Horrible in every sense of the word. Not a good story nor it is erotic.  Just a complete waste of money.,1531180800,,104,3.9523809523809526
