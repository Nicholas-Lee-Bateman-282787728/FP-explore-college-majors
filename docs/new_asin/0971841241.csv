7794423,5,0971841241,"This film may be too smart for some.  Avoiding sentimentality, it takes a hard-eyed look at the complexities of a sleazy trade.  Starting with a humorous look at Western myths about Asia, it moves to an extraordinary look into the Thai sex industry.  This is not the tame tourist bars of Patpong, but the hidden brothels that tourists never see.  Brothel owners and workers talk openly about their work.  The filmmakers also went secretly into Burma, showing the relationship of opium to the trafficking of women.
There is both humor (very funny bit of Hillary Clinton) and very moving personal stories (there was a 19yr old Bumese girl that had my wife in tears).  Trafficking is 'flavor of the month' -- This film shows how it really works.  Shorter version was on PBS.",1081382400,,771,4.7518796992481205
7794424,3,0971841241,"Despite the interesting (prurient-sounding) subject matter, at 77 minutes this film somehow gets to feeling repetitive and somewhat poorly organized.  There are a limited number of ""talking heads"" that keep reappearing but eventually seem to have run out of notable things to add.  This film could be a solid documentary with a running time of an hour.  As it is, you will get lots of good information, but not in as concise a format as you could have.  Yet, now, the film is technically feature length.  The choice of over-dubbing many of the interviews into English does not help matters, as it makes the narration sound almost non-stop.  More on-scene footage would have helped greatly, as well as hearing more from the women themselves in their own voices.",1079913600,,760,4.8984375
