8592390,5,B000E3UFWG,"The Rink, was fun. Roller skating humor. The ups and downs of skating and some romance.  The Immigrant movement made me lite headed for the motion back and forth, as they were on a boat headed for America. Shady guys and pretty ladies and landing on shore, after passing the Statue of Liberty. The Vagabond was Gypsy life and saving a young girl who finally found her Mother, thanks to Charlie. The main Feature is Tillie's Punctured Romance. Charlie marries for money, ends up in trouble and in jail,  He was sent on his way when all learned of the plot Charlie had with a girlfriend. This was interesting to see the inside of a 1914 movie Theatre. My parents had a ticket for two at the local theatre but never got there because a tornado did total damage as it tore through Austin, Mn  USA  the day before.  I still have the unused ticket to the Park Theatre. Admission was $.35 for Two Adults. This was back in 1927 and ticket was for Aug 15-16. It was a joy to watch movies that my parents were watching while they were dating.",1342656000,2,1032,4.354166666666667

As with most purveyors of such unrestored material, transfer quality is dependent on source material. VINA is about average in this regard.

Running times may be an issue with all of these Chaplin films. Recent restorations of the three shorts are several minutes longer than the 20 minutes here. This may be an indication that the longer German editions are dubbed at correct (i.e. slower) projection speeds. TILLIE'S PUNCTURED ROMANCE however is one of the half-length versions that have been floating around the home video market for decades. Flown-in music tracks do not match screen action; best to play these at low volume.

In THE RINK, Charlie demonstrates remarkable roller skating skill. THE VAGABOND was an early change of pace for the Little Tramp. After a bit of early tomfoolery it becomes a  small melodrama. ""Tillie's"" was the first-ever comedy feature film, as well as Chaplin's first full-length movie. It's based on the stageplay ""Tillie's Nightmare, which also starred Marie Dressler. THE IMMIGRANT was used by the US government to illustrate an inherent disrespect for Chaplin's adopted country. Such bits of cinematic social commentary plus Charlie's pro-Russia WWII activities and a long-standing refusal to apply for U.S. citizenship led to his being denied a re-entry visa after a 1952 England visit.

The three shorts in CHARLIE CHAPLIN FILM FESTIVAL are worth seeing. ""Tillie's Romance"" is far too truncated and should be ignored.
