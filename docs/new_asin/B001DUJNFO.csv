8294969,4,B001DUJNFO,"I'm a Railfan and I have been collecting material on the various railroads and locomotives around the world. There is a void in India where these kinds of products are few and far between. This DVD set is remarkable. I enjoyed the railroading action.

However it is not entirely flawless as the winter photo charter is bereft of commentary and there are 2 dvds covering the winter season on the same routes.

Now for the good part, the coverage of the 'Durango and Silverton' and the 'Cumbres and Toltec' is fantastic. I literally ""travelled"" on those lines. The section on the Illinois railway museum was very informative and I liked the exhaustive  coverage of BNSF's Stevens Pass. Other wonderful presentations include the coverage of the Belen region of the BNSF (esp. the Yard), the now rarely used Tennesse Pass, the scenic train rides in and around Colorado and a few DVDs dedicated to special steam locos. A special feature of this product is the informative commentary on the routes and the locos.",1260748800,2,1006,4.837209302325581
