6637713,4,B00NBIH060,"Someone (don't remember who) once said in regard to writing a screenplay: You should stay away from what people would expect. Write what's unexpected. Well....This writer/director took those words to heart.

Here's the scoop. Helen (Carla Juri) is a beautiful, precocious teenager from a broken home. Mom's a bit off her rocker and flows with the wind. Dad is almost totally clueless in how he interfaces with most anything around him. Helen has chronic hemorrhoids and adds insult to injury when she cuts herself while shaving her anus. Now she's in the hospital getting it taken care of which leads to an amount of self examination.

This is an all out assault on the viewer's sensibilities. It deals with all sorts of bodily fluids, bodily functions, hygiene, and a general amount of sex and sex related gooiness. There are scatalogical passages, blood soaked passages, filthy toilets and just about everything else that will make you squirm. Helen doesn't feel the need to be liked. She's usually in someone's face. Not necessarily in a confrontative way, but to put that person on their heels. But maybe she's doing this to see who can withstand the confrontation and thus be someone she can truly love. A real turning point in her life stemmed with the divorce of her folks. This is at the root of just about everything in her life now. And much of what she goes through in ""now"" time sends her back to recount various times in her childhood. All the good and bad things that brought her to this point in her life.

The characters, for the most part, are drawn well. All the acting and other production values are as good as they need to be. The soundtrack/score is very interesting.

This will not be everyone's cup of tea. I'm no prude but even I had turn my head a couple of times. But there is a certain humorous and whimsical element that lends an undeniable charm. As gross as this might be, it's also very sweet at its heart.

If left of center (way left of center) flicks are your poison, have at it. It's a one of a kind experience.

Thanks to Soft Machine for my title of this review.",1421971200,13,2100,4.586666666666667
6637714,4,B00NBIH060,"this movie had potential. it does ok, and by that i mean it jogs along with her while she explores her sexuality and scatology, but it's poorly done. we only get a brief glimpse into her psychology, a smattering of depth and then we get exposition which covers some oddness in her behavior. it drags a bit in the middle and were it not for some of the titillation of brief nudity it would lose all interest.
they worked hard at creating a character out of the male nurse. and there was a moment when it could have built on that, instead it lays there like a sad cold half eaten potato.",1421539200,5,585,4.232142857142857

6637717,4,B00NBIH060,"""Man, people were gagging in the aisle."" Those are the kind of words one expects to hear about a horror film from Eli Roth, not a generally good-natured romantic comedy. However much of the buzz surrounding David Wnendt's Wetlands has centered on its controversial aspects and it's easy to see why. The weak of stomach will want to steer far away but those made of sterner stuff will find this to be the sweetest comedy about an anal fissure they've ever seen.

That's right, Wetlands has as a crucial plot point the disgusting anal fissure suffered by Helen (Carla Juri), the flame-haired heroine out there looking for love. At first glance, Helen looks like a rebellious refugee from a teen comedy. She's tall, beautiful, blazing a trail on her skateboard with a mischievous gleam in her eyes. In short, Helen is very easy to love right away. But then the first thing you learn is that she's always had hemorrhoids. And that she isn't especially fond of bathing. Uh, where is this going exactly? Why, it's headed straight to the most disgusting, heinous toilet ever, where Helen enthusiastically drops trou and plops right down on the filthy commode. For most people that scene alone will be enough to send them screaming to the exits, but trust that it gets more disgusting from there.

The trick faced by Wnendt in adapting Charlotte Roche's grotesque novel is how to make the shocking and vomit-inducing aspects seem kind of normal, and he does that by taking them at face value. No easy task when Helen, who narrates frequently through voice-over, talks about her way of attracting men, of which she apparently has many suitors. She attracts them with her unwashed scent, essentially, made all the more foul by rubbing her genitals (the phrase ""pussy mucus"" is used) on places that desperately need a good cleaning. So it's no surprise that Helen is also somewhat obsessed with every type of body fluid. After one sexual encounter with a guy she keeps his crusty, gnarly semen on her hands, enjoying the scent. Forging a friendship with the shy but easily converted Corinna (Marlen Kruse), the two do things with dirty tampons that are nowhere on the instructions.

So how in the world can a film like this possibly be anything other than a complete circus? The various relationships in Helen's life are given just as much attention as her bizarre actions, and go a long way informing us how she ended up the way she is. Her divorced parents and a desire to see them reunited play a part, but also some cruel life lessons imparted by her mom clearly had an impact. After a gut-churning razor accident causes a nasty anal fissure, Helen is sent to the hospital where she flirts with a handsome nurse (Christoph Letkowski) who can't resist her brazen dislike of societal norms. As the love story develops and Helen's past is explored Wnendt wisely tones down the barf bag material, but not before it starts to get overwhelming. A dream Helen has about a pizza and a group of guys serves no purpose other than to raise the upchuck factor. But the few quiet moments found in-between the energetic editing and direction are genuinely heartfelt, and the flashbacks to Helen's childhood insightful.

A perfectly scored, electric soundtrack featuring Peaches and Canned Heat keeps up the blistering pace. Carla Juri also proves to be a live wire as Helen, in a challenging performance that most won't see and many will misunderstand. Wetlands is empowering in its way, chronicling one confident woman's sexual journey set completely on her own terms. Too gross for most people but definitely a fertile conversation starter, Wetlands is one of the year's most unique romantic comedies.",1410307200,98,3682,4.848966613672496

This is one hilarious, well filmed, well acted movie with some great twists and turns. Somewhat graphic....in a Train-spotting kind of way but much more gooey and humerous. It has some very dark humor. It also touches on the wetter parts of the human body and its orifices. While some may find it gross, I found it very sweet and innocent.

6637746,1,B00NBIH060,"Hands down the absolute worst, most repulsive movie I have seen...  If you're into bodily fluids and sex - this is your movie!  If you're like the majority of people in society and the idea of consuming pizza that's been ejaculated on by five men is not your 'cup of tea' - avoid this movie like the plague.

The movie (in Deutsch gesprochen) follows a German teen, Helen, and her escapades concerning every oriphus and bodily fluid you can imagine.  One scene *spoiler* involves her bare handed playing with her surgically removed anal fissure ... Yeah, you just read that correctly.  There's plenty more antics, but I don't want to write an x-rated review.  Pardon the pun, but the bottom line is that this movie is absolutely the worst movie Netflix has EVER recommended to me. I continue to wonder why oh why would Netflix recommend such a repulsive movie?  It was my understanding their algorithm recommended movies/tv shows similar to what you like to watch... I can assure you this would NEVER make the list.

So, if you're into bizarre fetishes with body fluids...this one is for you.  If you're the type of person who would prefer not to watch someone play with an anal fissure or constantly inserting a finger into their vagina and taste it, or rub their genitals on a urine and public hair covered public toilet seat, while standing barefoot in an inch of fecal water - avoid this movie at all costs.",1470268800,,1411,4.657258064516129

6637759,1,B00NBIH060,"I'm only posting this to thank those who wrote reviews about this movie and their personal thoughts about the apparently insanely graphic nature of this movie which a few said was a MILD version of the book it's based on. I also wish to say that my one star rating is for all those who think that anyone male/female enjoys all the disgusting and depraved things I've read about from most of the reviews that explained the movie. I'm very saddened as someone old enough to remember the days before NC-17, before male frontal nudity on cable TV shows, and long before the totally apathetic attitude those who liked this movie have regarding things that may not be new to the history of the world, but all things described are somehow accepted as ""just what this female lead character is obsessed about"". I'm sorry everyone, but I've got many health problems and one being Crones Disease which causes severe and near constant painful diarrhea. The very last thing I might find remotely entertaining is a movie about feces, urine, hemorrhoids, etc. Based solely on the reviews, I think this movie should be rated X and not allowed to be sold to anyone under 18. My conclusion...this movie PROVES that this country and the world has no chance in hell of ever reverting back to a place worth living in. I'm far from a prude, but this crosses a line I feel should never been crossed in the world of cinema. History proves that EVERY great civilization from the dawn of human history once reaching its pinnacle, always crashes and vanishes from the face of the earth once sick and aberrant behavior is accepted as ""okay"".",1452643200,3,1613,4.663157894736842

6637767,4,B00NBIH060,"Definitely a movie to watch a few times, regardless of ones perverted nature. It's very well done, and the acting is superb. But the sex is distracting from the deeper layers of this dysfunctional girl and her dysfunctional family. Much like A Clockwork Orange, I think this movie is saying that vulgarity can lead to purity, and that over purification may lead to vulgarity. It challenges every moral fabric one may have on sex, religion, family and institutional care. It literally tears it off the bed of our minds and exposes what's under the sheets. Yet, like a strip show on the dark side of town, the nudity, lap dances, drugs and alcohol, businessmen and bikers, and undercover police nearby. A sane person will eventually ask themselves 'How did these people get like this? How long has it been going on, and how long will it last? Are the good that bad, and are the bad ever to be good?' And this movie puts it all and more right in front of the viewer without apology. The perverted and kinky that expect a floor show will get it. But will hopefully come away asking themselves was it too much? And the sensitive and queasy may come away thinking there could've been more. All in all it's enough to be an interesting and thought provoking movie.",1432166400,,1256,4.586666666666667
6637768,2,B00NBIH060,"After its opening shot of what appear to be a set of buttocks, which when the camera pans out are revealed to be nothing more innocuous than the side of a bent knee, we are introduced to teenage Helen and her hemorrhoids, along with her disinterest in ""hygiene.""  This isn't merely hinted at; we are treated to the spectacle of Helen thoroughly rubbing her crotch around what may be the filthiest toilet seat in Europe, in a restroom ankle-deep in crapulous water (she happens to be barefoot in this scene).  In short, nothing that anyone who sat through&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Human-Centipede/dp/B004KAQV2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Human Centipede</a>&nbsp;will have any trouble with.

All of this is in service of essentially the same plot as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Parent-Trap/dp/B003QSPTAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Parent Trap</a>, only without the twin sister or the stunning natural settings.  Helen decides to take the opportunity of her hospitalization for a self-inflicted anal fissure to try and get her divorced parents back together; why she would want to do this is never addressed.  The father is a clueless dolt who can't seem to pay close enough attention to Helen to avoid hurting her, first by slamming her hand in a car door, and later in the hospital, giving her a hemorrhoid cushion that the doctor advises Helen not to use as it will reopen her surgical site.  The mother is even worse, almost sub-human in her viciousness - she teaches the eight-year-old Helen to ""not trust anyone, not even your parents"" by inviting her to jump off a ledge into her arms, then stepping aside to let Helen hit the ground.  ""A skinned knee now is better than a skinned heart later.""  Whatever you say, Mom.  Later, the mother kills a pet rat that Helen rescued from a toilet (of course) by placing it in a plastic shopping bag and slamming it against the wall.

The film concludes with Helen's best friend (who shares her fascination with bodily fluids, especially blood) having a baby with her jailed drug-dealer boyfriend, while Helen finds true love with the hospital orderly who cared for her during her stay.  I can't think of too many other films where so much was brought to the service of so little.  No doubt others will see a depth here that is an insightful comment on the human condition, but in the end it's only Scheie.",1430956800,4,2463,5.255102040816326

Warning: gross out factor here is pretty damn high. If you can make it beyond the first 10-15 minutes or so then you can probably get through the whole movie. But why would you want to if you're not into the exploration of scat and other bodily fluids?? LOL... well, for what it is, it's actually pretty well-done. And it's even darkly funny and has a quirky charm... and it's just soooooo outrageous.

It's not showing a rating, but this should definitely be at least an NC-17 rating. Some scenes are very pornographic (oral sex, multiple instances of male/female frontal nudity, including 4 males graphically touching themselves, rubbing herself on a dirty gas station toilet, getting shaved all over by an older/nude co-worker). The non-stop intention to shock is pretty clear.

I actually found this one under Amazon's LGBT genre shelf, but I'm going to insist this is an error. This is NOT an LGBT-themed story at all. There is some sexually explicit stuff here, as I said, which includes one f/f scene with a prostitute and some very graphic oral sex... but it's more about the lead's recklessly adventurous sexuality than the lead's specific sexual orientation. I would even hesitate to call her bisexual. She just seemed to have major mommy issues. And daddy issues. It really tried to be a character study... of sorts.

It's the story about an attractive teenager (18?) obsessed and turned on by all play involving bodily fluids (including, feces, urine, blood, arousal fluids, saliva, snot, etc etc). And she's got an issue with chronic hemorrhoids to boot. When a shaving accident plagues her with a nasty anal fissure, she takes her bloody rear to the hospital. During her extended stay, she develops a connection with an intrigued male medical staff member.

Aside from her obsession with the icky antics, Helen is also obsessed with getting her divorced parents back together. The film is threaded with ongoing flashbacks of her childhood and reveals much about her relationship with her parents. The story is pretty comedic overall, but still... I think the emotional abuse/neglect she experienced from her parents was far more disturbing for me than any of her graphic explorations.

Just a weird and weirdly engaging story, lol. Not recommended for the faint of heart. And definitely no lesbians to be found here. Nope. I watched it on Netflix where THEY wisely did not shelve it as LGBT. I could not rate it higher than 3 stars because this isn't my thing and it made me squeamish (I instinctively covered my eyes more than once)... but if it was, it probably deserves 4 stars. I also want to add that this lead was physically attractive in a very... wholesome? way... it somehow managed to tone down a lot of the ickiness for me and gave Helen quite a bit of quirky charm.",1422662400,26,2835,4.835051546391752

8677198,5,B00NBIH060,I enjoyed the movie because of its gentle sensuality.  Actions of the woman involved in the current time are supported by childhood and coming of age flash backs.  There is humor and a very likable heroine.  I have watched it twice and will watch it again in the future.,1520640000,,270,4.469387755102041
8677199,3,B00NBIH060,"Well, Helen certainly has some weird approaches to hygiene, but as far as being extremely gross, perhaps my level is set too high, but that tampon scene certainly wasn't 'normal'.
