8574494,1,B00BVEF8HE,"The parade of the samba schools at Carnival in Rio makes Pasadena's Rose Parade look like a procession of Carmelites. There is excitement, creativity to burn, energy, beauty, sex, color, light, noise, and joy. The dancers, costumes, floats, people, and singing are beyond compare. Would that we could have seen all this on this video. The cameraman, who evidently is new to the taking of moving pictures, produced a work that reminds me of my Uncle Otto's home movies. Beside the wonderful parade, there were 4,302 various hangers-on walking along each side of the street: monitors, supervisors, flunkies, other photographers, assistants, interns, and members of the general public looking for a place to find a bathroom. This photographer was able to capture each of them,giving long shots of backs of heads, backs, bottoms, sides, and even a few shots into the cameras of what other people were shooting. It didn't occur to him to point his camera elsewhere when a flunky was standing in front of him. There was virtually no editing of the tape to remove any of these errors. So, get this tape if you want to see a world-class event covered very poorly.",1390262400,,1155,4.8979591836734695
