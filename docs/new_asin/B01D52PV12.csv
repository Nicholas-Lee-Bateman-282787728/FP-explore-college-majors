7697031,2,B01D52PV12,"""We pray at the same alter."" In this town cops and criminals are the same people. When a gang is caught and blackmailed by the Russian mob they only have one option other then death. They are to break into a special forces safe house and steal classified government files. Without any real choice the crew realizes that the only way to pull this off is to set up a 999 call. When criminals, good cops, and bad cops all become involved something is bound to go wrong. I was actually looking forward to watching this. The cast is incredible, the idea sounded very interesting and I was hoping for a movie along the lines of Smoking Aces, but a little more serious. I wondered why it came and went in the theaters so fast but I was still excited. I watch and review every movie I order for the store and because of that 99% of the time I review my first impression of the movie. I did something I never do with this one. I watched it twice because I figured it couldn't have been as bad as my first impression was. After the second viewing I came to the conclusion that this was one of the most disappointing movies I have seen. I'm not sure how a movie with an idea this interesting and a cast this great can drop the ball so badly but they did. They movie was flat and uninteresting, hard to follow at times and just overall nothing I was hoping for. Overall, even having watched it twice before writing this I have a hard time finding something good to say about the movie. Very disappointing. I give this a C.",1460937600,,1510,4.246527777777778

Under a citys dark underbelly, the Russian mob extort a crew of ex-military into an impossible bank heist. Everything goes right until everything goes wrong.

What did I think?

Even with 90 minutes of jaw-clenching unnervingness and 25 minutes of smoldering acting, theres just one small problem: Theres no actual ending. Theres a plot, some twists, but no resolution. You leave the theater with a feeling of dread.

If you're happy to watch a movie filled to the brim with tension but no resolution, go see it. Otherwise, steer clear.",1458604800,,553,4.913978494623656
7697034,3,B01D52PV12,"This police-crime potboiler is so loaded with talented actors, they cant help but get in the way of each other.  Were never quite sure who the central character is.  In addition, except for Casey Afflecks Chris Allen, every character is despicable or at the very least, unlikeable.  Michael Atwood (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a former army vet and mercenary who free lances for a Jewish-Russian crime boss, nicely played by Kate Winslet.  Shes a stand in for her husband who is in an Israeli prison.  His ticket out is locked inside a Homeland Security vault in Atlanta.

Atwood heads a gang of criminals whose day job is working for the Atlanta police department.  They include Anthony Mackie as Marcus, Norman Reedus as Russell, his brother Gabe (Aaron Paul) and Franco (Clifton Collins, Jr.).  Atwoods last job was to be his last but sister-in-law Irina (Winslet) insists that he pull off this one last, nearly impossible job.  If Atwood wants to see his wife (Gal Gadot) and son again he must comply.  Irina isn't threatening their lives but has them sequestered in another country.  Atwood and his cop buddies conclude that they need to distract the police long enough to get in the building and past security long enough to get the items needed.  They come up with the idea of a triple 9 which is a police code for officer down.  They plan on killing one of their own.  I told you these guys were creeps.

When Chris Allen is transferred into the unit and becomes Marcuss partner, he seems like the logical victim.  Of course logic doesnt always work, especially in the movies.  Woody Harrelson is another cop.  Not a bad guy, just constantly high.  Oh, and hes also Chriss uncle.  I will admit to getting caught up in some of the action sequences including a terrific sequence shot with hand-held cameras.  Chris leads a squad of cops into a squalid high rise searching for a drug lord.  It is very scary and very effective.

John Hillcoats (Lawless and The Road) direction isn't really the problem.  I found the technical aspects of the film very good and the acting is convincing if at times distracting (Afflecks constant gum chewing).  I had a concern as to what the focus should be or perhaps more precisely, on whom it should be.  At the end of the day, everyone gets what they deserve but I felt a little unclean walking out.",1458432000,2,2333,4.6568627450980395
7697035,3,B01D52PV12,"A group of former special ops lead by a crooked cop work for the ""Russian Kosher-nostra"" the Russian Jewish mafia in Atlanta. After pulling one heist, they are tasked with a second one where they would need a lot of time. They opt to create a diversion by killing a cop, creating a 999 call. This would give them the time.

While we get that plan early, it isn't executed until late in the film. What the bad guys are up against is a salty Woody Harrelson detective with paid informants and quite the wordsmith. Outside of the Harrelson character, the film was a run of the mill crime drama/thriller.

7697036,2,B01D52PV12,"""999"" is law enforcement code for ""Officer Down."" I learned that about halfway through this darkly intense heist film. I enjoy a good heist film every now and then; but this one is TOO intense and TOO dark. Most of the characters need a bath; their hair is greasy and filthy. The intense moments are spent in equally filthy hallways of public housing tenements where we expect gunmen to open fire at any moment.

Director John Hillcoat (""Lawless"") working with scriptwriter Matt Cook (""By Way of Helena"") brings us a terrific cast and a plot where the Russian mob is blackmailing a crew of criminals and dirty cops into an impossible heist. The cops know their best hope for success is to kill a rookie and with the ""999"" code, divert the city police to the scene of that crime. Then they will pull their heist while there are no other police available to call.

Here is part of the cast:
  * Anthony Mackie (""The Avengers"") Marcus Belmont always looks the part. He's well-groomed, neat, and understands the people on the street. He is a highly respected police officer who has the task of breaking in the rookie.
  * Casey Affleck (""The Finest Hours"") Rookie Chris Allen never thought it would be this challenging to ""make a difference.""
  * Woody Harrelson (""Hunger Games"") Sergeant Detective Jeffrey Allen has substance abuse problems but he also has the instincts and the ""nose"" of a cop. He is our rookie's mentor.
  * Michael Kenneth Williams (""Boardwalk Empire"") Sweet Pea knows exactly what is going down. It's just a bit of a challenge to get him to share....
  * Chiwetel Ejiofor (""Secret in Their Eyes"") Michael Atwood is the brains of the gang, inventive, skilled with explosives and human behavior; also, he will do anything to protect his little boy.
  * Aaron Paul (""Breaking Bad"") Gabe Welch is the loose cannon; I hated to see him come on screen.
  * Clifton Collins Jr. (""Westworld"") Jorge Rodriguez shows us what a really bad guy looks like!
  * Kate Winslet (""Steve Jobs"") is amazing! She disappears into the character of Irina Vlaslov, who will stop at nothing to get her Russian mobster husband out of jail. I knew Winslet was part of the cast, but had to keep studying Irina's face to be sure. Winslet's demeanor, her makeup, her accent, her clothes, everything about her was so unlike anything I've ever seen her do before. Kudos!

This R-rated thriller became so involving the jaded screening audience actually cheered one of the (many) explosions. We let numerous F-bombs roll off our backs and sat through endless double crosses, gun fights, beheadings and yelling matches, but ultimately discovered we actually had one person to root for.  Yikes!",1458345600,3,2674,4.784313725490196

This, as shown in the film, makes no sense. I hope that it is not a true procedure.
The plot in the film is about a white Russian mob that forced black men, including some who are cops, to first rob a bank, and later to rob Homeland Security. Fearing that an attack on Homeland Security will bring many police to the scene. the crooks decide to divert the police by killing a cop signaling 999 and causing the police to leave all other activities, even an attack on Homeland Security, to give them time to take from the government office what the Russian mob wants them to take.
The film is filled with action and bad cops and double crosses. But there was something wrong with it that I could not identify, something bothered me, something that stopped me from enjoying the action, and that is why I gave the film only three stars.",1505692800,2,1104,4.3125

7697083,4,B01D52PV12,"""Triple 9"" is a taut drama with a dream cast. However, its complex storyline that feels as if it were crushed into a steel press to run just less than 2 hours. With at least eight subplots, lightly sketched characters, and a cast that includes Chiwetel Ejiofor, Anthony Mackey, Woody Harrelson, Casey Affleck, Aaron Paul, Norman Reedus, and Clifton Collins Jr. I wanted this to be a 5-star film. If the film kept the pace of the first half hour, it would have been.

A heist crew of cops and robbers, most or all apparently former military, engages in high-stakes bank robberies and other precision thefts with the patronage of a Russian mobster, played by an unrecognizable, glammed out Kate Winslet. She's flanked by the two scarier henchmen ever on screen, more so because of the blood puddles always being washed off of the floor and trucks from their meat packing front company.

The precision of the film's small details are telling. The use of military tactics, down to radio communications, not seen on film since Michael Mann's ""Heat"" (1995), the carefully rendered battle scars on faces and heads, the recognizable Blackwater bear paw tattoo on Reedus' hand ... details lazily omitted from lesser dramas.

I'm not going to rehash the plot. Enjoy the film for yourself. I believe my complaint is common across all reviews: So many great characters and stories, thrown together with what may have been a series of brisk final edits. Imagine a fantastic feature article with no transitions and so little exposition you need a mind map diagram to connect key points. One character is related to another key character, transferred from lighter duty elsewhere; part of the robbery crew isn't in law enforcement; other members have expertise in explosives and familial relationships with the Russian mobster. It all unfolds in fast speed.

What follows is something like ""Heat,"" something like ""The Shield,"" and something unique and original. Everything occurs in such a compressed time allotment that the scheming and double-crosses and cool ""Triple 9"" (officer down) strategy to pull off a major heist feel rushed.

That said, you can't beat this cast. It's rare to find this many guys on modern celluloid who look like they could deal damage in real life. They're not preening fitness magazine cover types. You have to reind to to ""The Shield,"" then ""Heat,"" and then back to 1987's ""Extreme Prejudice"" by the inimitable Walter Hill. Ejiofor and Mackey are underused, underappreciated talents. Shame on Hollywood. I've typically seen both in too many supporting roles when either could carry a film. Mackey was the most sympathetic character in ""The Hurt Locker."" He played the insecure, impotent and fragile bodybuilder in Michael Bay's ""Pain and Gain"" (2013).  Ejiofor has sufficient screen presence he made David Mamet's ""Redbelt"" (2008) work, as a military veteran and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu expert reluctant to fight. Ejiofor pulled it together, despite Mamet's convoluted story and lazy plot development. Casey Affleck, the more talented brother, was the serial killer sheriff in ""The Killer Inside Me"" (2010), carried some cool indie flicks, and saw some acclaim as the investigator in ""Gone Baby Gone.""

All in all, its a worthwhile 115 minutes that could have been a masterpiece had a longer cut had emerged. Another half hour or so could have pushed ""Triple 9"" to five stars. If you look to ""Heat,"" it actually was less ambitious by focusing on two pillar characters, with balanced sub-plots (the dishwasher-driver, Waingro, stepdaughter...) that fed the parallel story arcs. Its 2 hour and 52 minute running time offered a complete view, with plenty of time for sweeping views of Los Angeles and epic gun battles coordinated by former British SAS soldiers.",1481500800,,3769,5.079159935379645

Australian director John Hillcoat made one of the most depressing movies Ive ever witnessed, THE ROAD. While it was well made and took a serious look at what it would be like to survive the end of the world as we know it, it was indeed a movie not to allow anyone on a death watch view. Then he made LAWLESS which was quite different, the true story of a family who made their money via moonshine in the depression era Virginia. So when I heard he had a new movie coming out I was interested to see what it would be like.

TRIPLE 9 tells the story of bad cops gone worse. Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as Mike, the leader of a crew of thieves, among which are two police detectives, Marcus (Anthony Mackie) and Franco (Clifton Collins Jr.). Mike owes the Russian mob another score and the job they have him scheduled for is a seemingly impossible task. As the gang plots out a method to accomplish their goal the only thing they can come up with is to create a situation that calls for a triple 9 distress call, officer down. The call will result in all officers in the area being required to lend assistance thereby leaving their intended target unguarded for a short period.

But to do this there is one hitch. They must actually kill a fellow officer. While Marcus wrestles with this issue Franco is all about taking it on. The difference in characters makes for some interesting interaction between the pair. The decision is made and now they need to focus on just who they plan to set up.

Around this same time Marcus has been assigned a new partner, Chris Allen (Casey Affleck). Chris has been on the force for a while and is the nephew of Jeffrey Allen (Woody Harrelson) a name to be reckoned with on the force. While Casey knows his way around police work he doesnt know the streets hes been assigned to like Marcus does. While partners they don't see eye to eye on how to handle things. When the crew decides to choose Chris as their target its less difficult for Marcus due to the nature of their partnership.

Problems come not from Marcus but from fellow crew member Gabe (Aaron Paul), an addicted criminal who thinks this is going too far. As the film progresses Gabe tries to be the voice of reason and get them to refuse the job. What he isn't aware of is that Mike has no option but to follow through. Failure to do so will result in not only retribution from the Russians but the loss of his son as well.

The movie works on some levels and not on others. As a well-conceived story you can tell that a lot of thought went into this one. Like an onion layers are peeled away getting to what is really going on and its never quite what it seems. That being said there is also not enough solid clues for viewers to pick up on the end result.

The acting here is some of the best youll find on screen, from the more well-known stars to those that are familiar faces yet not quite so familiar names. Collins is superbly slimy here as a cop who doesnt care who he kills and has no morals whatsoever. Mackie does a great job showing that he can do more than don wings for superhero movies. Affleck proves that he has no reason to hide in his brothers shadow. And Harrelson displays an ability that many would not have seen coming back when he played Woody on TVs CHEERS.

The end result is a movie thats not bad but not necessarily good either. At just under 2 hours there are moments that shine while others simply feel like the pace plods along. Had those scenes been trimmed down, left out or just written differently that might not have been the case but as is they offer moments where I found myself yawning and dozing occasionally. Do the good sequences make up for the bad? I would say yes they do but know going in that the movie will not be a slam bang shoot em up that the trailer might have you believe. Realize that not everyone is going to walk away in the end and that the true story of what is going on here is deeper than you realize. If you do so you just might enjoy this one.",1470700800,,4054,4.276401564537157

7697132,2,B01D52PV12,"Triple 9 starts off well, but once the initial heist is over, it becomes a boring, jumbled film with not a lot happening for most of it other than people talking in a worried voice and stressing.  The DVD case and marketing of the film promotes a lot of big names, but most of these are barely in the film.  If you are a Breaking Bad or Walking Dead fan and wanted to see Aaron Paul or Norman Reedus, well don't get up and go to the bathroom or make something in the kitchen as you might miss them. Likewise Teresa Palmer.  Obviously they must either have had commitments elsewhere or had committed before reading the script, tried to back out, and the small amount of screen time was the compromise.  Teresa Palmer actually looked a bit like she had the flu or something and not the hot actress she normally is on screen. She has a couple of lines supporting her husband character and encouraging him to go back to work while she stays in their house, but that's it.

The film isn't confusing or anything, it makes sense, it's just not that interesting.  None are the characters are likable, I can't say I'd recommend it.  Maybe wait for it to be on TV down the track but don't waste any money on it.",1467417600,,1201,4.311111111111111

7697150,4,B01D52PV12,"Triple 9 is, on the surface, a B movie with familiar trappings  a robbery, betrayal, a femme fatale. An unusually impressive roster of actors, however, elevates what otherwise might be a mediocre picture to one that demands attention.

A methodically planned Atlanta bank robbery starts Triple 9 with excitement. Before we know anything about the perpetrators, we witness their precision of execution, knowledge of the banks layout, rigid time schedule, and token gunfire to terrify employees and customers.

Eventually, we learn that the team is a mix of bad cops and former military special ops. Marcus Belmont (Anthony Mackie) and Franco Rodriguez (Clifton Collins, Jr.) are the police officers and Gabe Welch (Aaron Paul) a former cop. Michael Atwood (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is the former brother-in-law of Irina Vlasov (Kate Winslet), head of the Russian-Jewish mob. Using his son as a pawn, Irina manipulates Atwood into doing her nefarious bidding.

When the team delivers the stolen cash and demands payment, Irina stalls them with the promise of a huge payday if they postpone taking their cut until they do one more job for her. Feeling double-crossed, they finally agree to the second job after Irina incorporates lethal muscle.
The requisite good guy is police officer Chris Allen (Casey Affleck) who is new to the precinct and is partnered with Belmont. Hard-drinking detective Jeffrey Allen (Woody Harrelson) is Chriss uncle.

The plot is all over the place yet keeps us glued through a combination of confusion and awe. Director John Hillcoat has no problem setting up intricate relationships, but less success developing them with clarity. Though the good guys don't recognize the bad guys, we know the relationships. It would probably have increased suspense if this information were doled out gradually and more dramatically. The characters, with one exception, are generic types weve encountered before.

The exception is Irina, a cold-blooded woman who runs the criminal enterprise while her husband sits in a Russian prison. Sporting a bouffant hairdo and a huge Star of David, Irina coolly dispatches her yarmulka-wearing thugs to carry out her bidding. Confident in her power to get what she wants through intimidation and worse, she is right up there with such screen crime icons as Don Corleone (The Godfather), Tony Montana (Scarface), and Frank Costello (The Departed). With a convincing Russian accent, Ms. Winslet adds both class and raised eyebrows to the proceedings.

Hillcoat portrays the mean streets of Atlanta like a war zone, with automatic weapons, gangs, and drugs an everyday way of life. This environment has both hardened the robber cops and given them the knowhow to enrich themselves under the guise of protecting the community. When the second heist requires a major distraction to draw cops away from the scene, they figure that the shooting of a cop  in coptalk, a triple 9  will draw nearly every police officer in the vicinity.

The film earns its R rating with considerable violence, much of it unexpected. In this movie, human life is only as valuable as a cog in a well-oiled mechanism. When any member of the team threatens to expose the others, he becomes expendable.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray edition include deleted scenes, the cast offering an in-depth look at the films characters and plot twists, and a discussion with director John Hillcoat and cast about how their approach to filmmaking helped to highlight the movies gritty, authentic look and feel.",1464652800,3,3512,5.165492957746479
7697151,3,B01D52PV12,"Like other reviews, the cast excited me as well as the director.  It is a slick looking movie but the story just seemed jumbled to me or a bit rushed.

For me, watching Woody Harrelson play another half twisted character made the film more than worthwhile.  Superb acting all around with an unfortunate blah script.",1464393600,3,448,4.426829268292683

7697153,3,B01D52PV12,"Alexander Pope once said, Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed. Expectations are a funny thing, and run in concert with ambition. The greater a filmmaker's ambition, generally expectations are raised right along with it. The problems arise when a film has all of the necessary ingredients to achieve greatness, and yet the ambition is shockingly weak. Such is the case with ""Triple 9"", a decent-sized cop thriller from an accomplished director whose three prior features; ""The Proposition"", ""The Road"", and ""Lawless"", were muscular, machismo-laden dramas that should make him perfect for a story on corrupt cops. With a cast that any director would sell off their kids for, the film should truly be something special, and yet the end result is merely a serviceable thriller with few memorable qualities.

""Triple 9"" is a good film, but it should have been great. Matt Cooke's screenplay drew acclaim as part of the Black List, the best unproduced screenplays going around Hollywood. It teases some interesting, unexpected twists that unfortunately never pan out into anything remotely surprising. What it does with fairly rote material is still entertaining, largely due to the novelty of the A-list cast and Hillcoat's slow-burn pacing. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Michael, a bank robber with Special Forces training who pulls off jobs with his military pal, Russell (""The Walking Dead""'s Norman Reedus), a pair of corrupt cops in Marcus (Anthony Mackie) and Jorge (Clifton Collins Jr.), and Russell's drug addict brother, Gabe (Aaron Paul). The opening crime, while simple in design, is nonetheless a barnburner given energy and street-level grit by DP Nicholas Karakatsanis, who does tremendous work throughout.

None of these guys are what you would call saints, but even they are being manipulated by a more devious power, Irina (Kate Winslet, sporting big hair and bigger Russian accent), a mobster's wife who neglects payment and demands they take on another, near-impossible job. Michael, the de facto leader of the crew, refuses, but he's forced into it by Irina's violent tendencies. Plus, Irina's sister (Wonder Woman herself, Gal Gadot) is the mother of his son, and he doesn't want them to take him away for good. To pull off this unlikely crime, they'll need to buy some extra time. One way to do it is to cause a ""triple 9"", police code for an officer down, by killing Marcus' new partner, Chris Allen (Casey Affleck).

Chris is pretty much the only redeemable character in the entire film, and that includes Chris' uncle (Woody Harrelson, playing a less racist version of his Rampart character), who happens to be investigating the robberies by Michael's crew. But Chris is also barely a part of the narrative thrust for much of the film, as it focuses mostly on Michael's crumbling group and their various bouts of conscience. There isn't a single turn the film takes that you haven't seen before in any film directed by David Ayer (""End of Watch"", ""Sabotage""). There's no honor among thieves or dirty cops, and that's especially true when you combine both. Betrayals are set up a mile in advance and play out exactly as anyone could easily predict.

While certainly familiar, the cast makes up for much of it, even though only a few of the starry bunch get well-rounded characters to portray. Mackie gets the meatiest role by far, as Marcus is conflicted over being asked to kill one of his brothers in blue. Affleck is perfectly solid as Chris, but the character is too thinly-drawn and mostly out of the action until the final stretch. Ejiofor brings his usual commanding presence, and he's particularly good when paired up with Winslet, although she probably could have turned the hamminess up a few notches. Think what Jessica Chastain was able to do in ""A Most Violent Year"" and that's where Winslet should have gone, but she's disappointingly straight-laced. On the complete opposite end of the spectrum is an appearance by ""The Wire""'s Michael K. Williams, and let's just say you'll never look at Omar Little the same way again.

""Triple 9"" should scratch the itch for fans of the genre, but those who look at the incredible level of talent and expect a shotgun blast of raw power; you're only going to get a .22.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Triple-9/dp/B01D52PWLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Triple 9</a>",1463788800,,4398,5.119777158774373

7697155,2,B01D52PV12,"Gritty but thoroughly uninvolving heist film wastes a stellar cast (Chewitel Ejiofor, Casey Affleck, Anthony Mackie, Woody Harrelson and many more) in a surprisingly muddled tale of crooked cops and ex-military types working for the Russian Jewish mafia on the side.  They pull off an exciting heist that opens the film, but then the plot kicks in and you realize that this movie gives you nobody to care about or root for and the tension level drops to zero quickly.  The crew is forced to do a second job--stealing some evidence from a vault at Homeland Security.  Triple 9 means officer down, which is how they plan to pull off the job--kill a cop as a diversion so the police force mobilizes in response, then do the heist while the police are otherwise occupied.

It's actually a pretty stupid idea.  There are any number of things the robbers could do besides kill a cop to create a diversion--blow something up, for instance.  Since half the crew are actually on the job police officers you would think they might have a problem with killing one of their own for no reason other than to make it easier to pull off a robbery--but I guess that's meant to show how morally bankrupt the characters are.

Triple 9 really needed a stronger story and more suspense.  We don't feel the heat as Woody Harrelson closes in on the gang or any tension as the movie slowly moves towards the climactic heist.  We don't care if the criminals pull it off or get caught.  We don't care if the police officer who is set up to be shot for the triple 9 call lives or dies.  The movie is just simply a lot of tough-guy gruff that seems to take forever to go nowhere.

The only positive thing I can really say about Triple 9 is that the cast is first-rate, even if the movie never quite seems to know what to do with everybody.  I suppose if you've worn out your copies of Street Kings, Training Day, Dark Blue, End of Watch, Harsh Times, Rampart, Brooklyn's Finest and Sabotage maybe this will fill the bill as a single viewing time-waster, but that's probably an absolute best case scenario for Triple 9 which squanders a ton of talent while providing virtually no entertainment or thrills.  .",1462233600,12,2179,4.525510204081633
