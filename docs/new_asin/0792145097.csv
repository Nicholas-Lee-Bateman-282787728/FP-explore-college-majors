138412,5,0792145097,"Rocko is planning to have a Christmas party. A bunch of Little Elves had moved in across the street to Rocko. While Rocko is Christmas shopping, he notices one of them following him, he talks to it and brings it back to it's house.
He invites the elves to come to his Christmas Party. It is overheard by a neighbor. He spreads it and the word gets out & nobody wants to go to the party because they are afraid to catch diseases by the ""Swarm of Diseased Trolls"" (this is what the story ended up as, as it was spread, [the ELVES are not really diseased]).
The Elves find out and.... The Rest you'll have to see in the episode to find out :)
It's wonderful, Recommended for all ages! Someone else's review said not recommended for younger children, but I don't see why not,
Great For all Ages!!!",1017878400,3,793,4.293333333333333
138413,5,0792145097,"I personally started watching Rocko's Modern Life when it first came on... I was about 7 at the time.  I didn't fully start to love the show until I was about 13, and began understanding the jokes that the writers cleverly added to amuse people over the age of 10.  Rocko is an awesome cartoon(my all-time favorite) , so if you get a chance, watch it!",1010275200,2,351,4.303030303030303

138415,5,0792145097,"I remember when this show ran. It was sometime in the great era of Ren And Stimpy and other great shows like Doug. Not the ABC garbage but the original Doug on Nickelodeon. This show came out and after watching the very first episode, I fell in love with Roco and all of the other characters in this show. Watching Roco became a routine thing of mine after school days. Roco ultimitely became my hero. But not only does Roco provide humor that children can enjoy, it also has many jokes that slip past kids and make the parents laugh to. Roco is a show that after a hard day you can sit down and watch and just relate to how his days go. And the troubles he has then you think that you aren't so bad off anyway. Roco's Modern life is a parody on life that everyone form all ages can enjoy.",992304000,3,789,4.12987012987013

138420,5,0792145097,"I absolutely agree that John Kricfalusi revolutionized all things animation with Ren and Stimpy. The thing that clenches that proof is how terribly his imitators have messed up cartoons. But there is another oft-overlooked pioneer who is also widely imitated, Joe Murray. Rocko's Modern Life revolutionized cartoons by cleaning up animation. You need only watch a Rocko episode to see the beautiful visual art, the unique camera angle shots, the changes in pace, the potshots at popular culture and Americana so familiar from The Simpsons, the witty, but not overdone dialog. Joe Murray can have Rocko get a cold, yak, and then the spew jump out of the throne, dance around and nurse him back to health. His imitators think you can make a cartoon funny by throwing in fart jokes. They don't write for the characters, the story doesn't proceed from the characters, and their characters don't do what those particular characters would do. Hence the ruination of not only cartoons but live action comedies as the same bad writers go from studio to studio ""fixing"" things by writing in fart jokes. But every animator I've ever read has said, ""go to Joe Murray and learn from the Master,"" and cartoon fans are instinctively drawn to the adventures of Rocko. Rocko exemplifies Chesterton's adage that extraordinary things only happen to ordinary people, and the wallaby's holiday episode is one of the few cartoons that make the cut for repeated annual viewing. So where's Rocko on DVD?",1089590400,,1480,4.995951417004049
138421,4,0792145097,"For Rocko's Modern Life, it has always remained as one of my favorite cartoons in the history of Nickelodeon. Still, many people still think of the wallaby as a memory. Nevertheless, the cartoon still is something I always tune towards on video for a little taste of joy and humor. Joe Murray created one of the zaniest characters ever in animation, and this video shows no lies what so ever.
The video: Machine Madness, consists of three cartoons from the 1993 debut season of Rocko's Modern Life. There is just so much joy and humor within each and every single cartoon. The first episode, Suck-O-Matic, Rocko buys a new vacumm from an ad he saw on television. Unfortunately, it isn't as easily good-looking as it seems, nor is it nice. Soon as he'd expect it, the machine would have a mind of its own.
Unbalanced Load is the second cartoon. In this one, Rocko and his dog Spunky go to the laundromat to clean a whole lot of clothes. Ironically, while he is doing his clothes, a strange group of characters try to get his lucky shirt, and destroy it. That isn't all, Rocko also has to deal with a washer that actually hops away with his clothes.
The final cartoon Trash-O-Madness, showcases Rocko and Spunky trying to gather up all the garbage they can actually find, without trying to get near a bully dog. Unfortunately, Rocko doesn't realize that he actually puts Spunky within the trash comapctor, and when he notices, the bully dog tries to swallow Spunky whole. Thankfully, he got Spunky out. Either that, or there wouldn't be anymore cartoons.
It is just a shame that they don't make any newer episodes of this zany cartoon, or have any of them hit the video department. Still, it is just an amazing display of joy and heartache. I laughed pretty hard, that I almost snorted milk out of my nose when I first saw this cartoon. Still, Rocko's Modern Life will always remain a hit in my book.",1051574400,14,1898,4.5852941176470585

7792047,5,0792145097,"Usually I don't write about kids' TV shows, leaving such matters to my betters, ten year olds, but this dropped and unavailable show about a transplanted wallaby named Rocko living in American suburbia deserves more of a chance. Everyone who likes Rocko's show wonders why it's not available on DVD. (The same purgatory seems in place for Dexter's Lab.) The Cartoon powers apparently have decided thumbs down on poor Rocko, and obstinately refuse to release a DVD of Rocko and friends. Whatever their excuse it's a shame. Few TV cartoons can match Rocko's Modern Life for pure unadulterated over the top zaniness. The sense for Southern California living is remarkable, as is the oddly accurate buddy world Rocko inhabits. Trashy in Rocko is somehow magically converted into high chic.

Anyway, here on a good VCR tape are four of the wilder shows, with three tied to the 'out of control machine' theme, and a fourth when Spunky loses his brain. If you've already seen the ""Suck-o-Matic"" episode look no further, you'll want this. The other episodes on this Video are; ""Unbalanced Load"", ""Trash-O-Madness"", and ""How to Tell if Your Dog is Brainless"". If you think I'm nuts to be recommending this, you may be partly right - you have to be a little crazy to get Rocko.

Yes, Rocko is undeniably a show designed for young boys, or young males who have not graduated to something beyond cartoons, but it has a brilliance which at times far surpasses the run of the mill stuff pushed out as cutting edge, but which in time inevitably comes across as just trashy and sick. Rocko's different, and more importantly - hilarious! Many people don't realize this, but Rocko's best episodes have even been used as the basis for modern opera productions. (Only Rocko is ever so much better, as well as infinitely funnier.)

Amyway, don't hold your breath for more Rocko from the establishment. Such great episodes as ""Wacky Deli"" lanquish while the trite but apparently in demand girls shows are popping up on glossy DVDs with entire seasons. The more wily Rocko fans, disgusted by this censorship, have collected the entire series through tv copies. Just a hint.",1211846400,2,2150,4.868852459016393

Just take 5 minutes to sign in and sign the petition!!! I'm not sure how far this is going, but the more signatures, the better the chance that a DVD set will come out!!! Better than sitting here and commenting on how Nick has yet to put Rocko out on DVD.

For all the people simply stumbling onto this great 90s show, you should be wanting a DVD set as well, because after watching these episodes, you'll be loving it. Even though I personally think these aren't the best episodes, it's the best Nick can do, which isn't very good.

I don't care if Nick thought that Rocko had too many suggestive things in it, that's what made it so appealing to a wide range of viewers. I miss Rocko, I NEED Rocko!",1153267200,3,863,4.282208588957055
7792049,5,0792145097,"Sitting here reading all these comments of love & praise about this classic, light years ahead of it's time cartoon, Only makes me wonder more as to why there still isn't a DVD box set out there or here ? available ? Is there some sort of artistic issue or more likely a $ issue holding things up in some nasty court battle ??? If so... Get over it !!!

Rocko is one of my all time favorite cartoons too and seeing that there are so many others like myself out there covering a vast range of ages, Proves our point ! that this ""Real Marsupial Wonder"" from down under, deserves to be immortalized in a long over due manner befitting him and his many friends and from what I can see, the two lonesome foes #1: the kid that ranked on this video. Mostly because the theme song was to wimpy and irritating for his tastes... Blah Blah Blah. And #2: Ed Bighead who never liked Rocko or Heffer or anyone for that matter !!! So I'm thinking

I should copy all of these reviews and send them to Nickelodeon ??? Most of these were writen around the early 2000's and it's now three years since the last posting perhaps less for other videos of witch there are only six and two of them are the same video only relesed four years after the original without any bonus material to speak of !!! Whew... this soapbox writing is tiering stuff !!! So I will wrap up my sermon on the ibook with these immortal words spoken by Philbert Shelldon with some help from Heffer Wolf and edited for the occasion by myself (I hope I don't get sued, I hope I don't get sued)...
