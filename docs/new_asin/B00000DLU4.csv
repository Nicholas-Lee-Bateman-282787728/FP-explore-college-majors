8205697,5,B00000DLU4,"Dear Amazon,
I actually taped this video back in the 1980's when it first came out.  The funniest amateur comedy show I have ever seen.  I wish HBO would release this on DVD as a special edition or just put it back on the shelves.  I would definitely be willing to start or sign a petition to get it re-released.  It is a classic.",1324080000,3,330,4.109375
8205698,5,B00000DLU4,"I had been looking for the very rare 'Rodney Dangerfield's Ninth Annual Young Comedians Special' for a long, long time, the product was in excellent shape and the packaging was very nice. It even had bonus features not on my original version, long since lost who knows where.

I love the early performances of the likes of a young Sam Kinison, Louie Anderson and the classic Bob Nelson football routine, I almost wet myself the first time I saw it! It includes several other very funny young comedians.

Thanks for replacing a lost treasure!

8205699,5,B00000DLU4,"I recently got this video last year.  I've seen almost every single one of the young comedians specials.  This is by far the funniest.  Every single person on this tape keeps you laughing, it ranges from impressions, to one-liners, to Sam Kinisons hilarious screaming, and Yakov Smirnoffs views of America.  Bob Saget is the funniest I've seen him on this tape.  His material is great.  Be looking at Bob Nelson with a hilarious act.  I recommend this video to anyone looking for a great laugh.",987724800,12,494,4.741176470588235
