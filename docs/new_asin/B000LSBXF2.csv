2713328,3,B000LSBXF2,"I have quite a few Firm workouts.  Although this one may be good for the beginning exerciser (they do show a modifier) or intermediate level, it is not challenging for the advanced exerciser.  Additionally, the camera work is questionable; when there is a change to a power move, the camera is focused on the beginner modifier, so it takes a few steps to catch up to the main instructor when the camera shifts.  It does require minimal equipment, 3, 5, 7 for the intermediate, and 5, 8, 10 for the advanced.  The workout is broken into 3 sections, which are then broken up into two, 1 plyometric which includes minimal sculpting, and one companion cardio.  I found the dip presses challenging due to the speed in which they are performed, and did enjoy the ab work which includes standing twisting (the latest rage for abs), but for the most part, I found myself watching the clock next to my television waiting for it to be over. I will not be working this into my regular rotation but it might be good for a once a month workout.  The instructor is the same one who shows the beginning modifiers on the TransFirmer series.  While not overly perky, I did not find her to be encouraging or motivating.  If you are seeking a challenging workout with a good all-round instructor, choose the Jari Love DVDs.",1175472000,7,1304,4.5665236051502145
2713329,5,B000LSBXF2,Great workout.  This is more of the Firm that we are used to.  No equipment needed except for light dumbells.  An excellent Cardio video to add to your Firm collection.  Alison has a voice that is easy to follow.  You won't be disappointed.,1175385600,4,240,4.488372093023256
2713330,5,B000LSBXF2,"This is one of the best workouts that the Firm has put out in a very long, long time.

Even if you never have used The Firm before or don't have the Firm TransFIRMer or Fanny lifter step you can use this work. It only requires weights.

I LOVE this workout. There is a reason why the word ""Burn"" is in the title. My legs/buns were burning for a couple of days after the workout.

Good thing about this workout is that even a beginner can do this as their is a girl doing the workout who is showing modifications for beginners. Also, even more advanced people will get a great workout out of this one!!!",1174435200,3,602,4.172413793103448
2713331,5,B000LSBXF2,"I absolutely love this workout.  It was nice to have a high-energy workout that does not incorporate the Fanny Lifter or the TransFirmer.  Don't get me wrong.  I love doing leg presses since they really work, but there are times when I've been working out all week, and I want to get a total body workout but don't want to do the leg presses that day.  This is the video for all those who love sports drills, power moves and breaking a good sweat.  I also like that the beginner moves will still get a beginner a good workout.  I am crazy about the Firm, but there are some videos that I would never introduce to a beginner, even with the beginner modifications like Total Aerobic Body Shaping or Advanced Cardio Blast.  They are just too much for someone who has never worked out before or who has not worked out in a long time.  This video is completely doable by people of all fitness levels and is quickly going to become one of my favorites.  I can't wait for the other one that is supposed to be coming out soon, Power Sculpt Workout Kit, but I can't find any information on it on the net at all!!!  So we will see.",1173916800,35,1121,4.245283018867925
2713332,5,B000LSBXF2,"To be honest, The Firm isn't one of my favourite series.  Often, there are instructors not giving clear cuing and they can be out of time.  For some reason, I decided to give this a go and I'm glad I did because it's one of the better workouts of theirs.

There is lots of variations in movements and music so it's kept fresh and interesting.  For once I found the cuing very very precise and right on time.  The instructor, Alison Davis, not only cues well to let you know what's coming up, but also tells you all the time about proper form and technique.  The mix of toning and aerobics is perfect and I've found results already.  It's a little over 50 minutes all up, and all you need is two sets of dumbbells.  It's using basic choreography but the level is probably not for complete beginners - more of an intermediate to advanced level.

It's fun and I like to do this once or twice a week along with my other routines and dvds.  I thoroughly recommend this.",1173916800,63,964,4.305555555555555
2713333,4,B000LSBXF2,"I consider myself an advanced exerciser and this had me sweating buckets!  It's a great overall cardio and weight workout and the ab section at the end is wonderful.  The cueing is great, and so is the music.  It's also very easy to follow the beginner moves if you're new to working out or the FIRM style.  Previewing it before you actually do it is helpful since some of the moves are very quick paced.  I highly recommend it!",1173830400,11,428,4.367088607594937
2713334,4,B000LSBXF2,"I am a dedicated Firm Fan.  I have been working out with them for years.  This newest workout is pretty good.  I like it a lot more than I did the ones that they released last fall.  It has chapters, which means you can shorten the workout if needed.  I did the entire workout the first time and it made me sweat.

That being said, I don't really feel like this workout is the Cardio+Sculpt that it being billed as.  It felt like more cardio than sculpt to me.  I had to follow the beginner modification for plyometrics because I have problems with my knees.  Otherwise, I used the weights that they recommended.  It didn't feel like a good, muscle-burning workout.  Many of the older Firm Cardio+Sculpt workouts left your muscles feeling like jello!  This one just didn't give me that same feeling.  That's the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I do like this workout and plan to do it again.  I may increase the weights to get more of a sculpting workout.  That could be a recommendation to any intermediate/advanced exercisers that want to do this workout.",1173312000,69,1065,4.46875

2713391,5,B000LSBXF2,"This DVD lives up to the Firm reputation. You will work up a sweat. The DVD starts out a little slow after the warm up, but soon enough the pace picks up nicely! It is a longer workout, but if you are short on time, you can shorten the workout on your own-- there is no abbreviated workout option. I enjoyed this workout. I would recommend it.",1399507200,4,343,4.134328358208955
2713392,2,B000LSBXF2,Something about this workout is a bit different than the 10 or so other FIRM DVDs I have and love.  The music and performers seem to lack their normal energy level but I'll still include it in the rotation for something different.,1399420800,,230,4.476190476190476

You won't regret this purchase! Good for intermediates and advanced and makes you sweat!",1397088000,2,390,4.342465753424658

2713408,5,B000LSBXF2,The time flies while doing this workout!  I love it and feel great afterwards.  The instructor is fantastic and very easy to follow.  It is broken up into segments which can be done all at once (easily) or if you are short on time you can do only cardio or weights.,1391472000,2,265,4.1568627450980395
2713409,4,B000LSBXF2,"Definitely a good workout.  One of the more challenging cardio Firm workouts I have.  While it isn't a P90X or Insantiy video, it wasn't intended to be.  It has some flexibility to make moves more intense if desired and to back off when one gets tired or needs a little break.  Had many Firm videos for years, VHS no less, and was looking to increase my collection.  Happened to find a day where nearly all the videos were well under $10 each.  Great investments at that price and when used regularly!",1384819200,2,501,4.450549450549451
2713410,5,B000LSBXF2,"Not sure what to expect when purchasing this but for $4.50 I thought what the heck.  I've done other The Firm workouts.  This is awesome and a must buy.  Of course I really like Allison, the instructor. It is a strenous workout but after it is done you're like - Wow that went by fast and I feel great!.  Purchase it - you won't be disappointed.",1384732800,3,345,4.181818181818182
2713411,5,B000LSBXF2,"I'm a long-time FIRMIE and have been disappointed with several of the ""pinks""-  but was happily surprised with this one.  Allison is fairly new to me- but I think she is a good instructor.  She must have some dance experience- but her routines have a dance ""feel"" to them.  This keeps the moves from getting boring and adds an element of grace to a hard, sweaty workout.
This work out is about 50+ minutes- and I am sucking wind through most of it.  It starts off a little slower- but definitely amps up throughout the workout.
I like the mix of cardio, strength and plymometrics-  a signature of the FIRM and muscle confusion.

I have about 20 FIRM videos- and this is easily one my favorites.  Highly recommend this one.",1383523200,4,722,4.5
2713412,3,B000LSBXF2,"The Firm Bootcamp is a good workout DVD that will have you sweating and hurting the next day. You will burn a lot of calories, if done properly. I love  the instructor. Alison does a great job explaining the different routines and giving cues before the next exercise. However, I give this DVD three stars because the music and lighting are awful. I really hate it, but I've learned to tune it out by focusing on Alison and the routines. The effects aren't very good either. For some reason, they (director, editor, and/or producers) thought it was a good idea to blur the girls' arms when they circle them about. I know they must have thought it would look cool, but it doesn't. Between that and the weird tinted lights, it is very distracting and hard on my eyes. Also, at some point in the video, you can see a camera sneak into the shot on the left. If you're not looking for it, you just see this black thing pop in and out, leaving you to wonder what the heck it was until you stop and rewind to find out. All of these tidbits make the video appear cheap and unprofessional. The only thing that seems good and professional is the instructor and the workout itself. I wish they had stuck with the layout of the Firm Ultimate Fat Burning Workout with Alison. That one was really great!",1376524800,,1289,4.393305439330544
2713413,4,B000LSBXF2,"I love the Firm workouts and this one did not disappoint.  This workout has a nice mix of cardio and plyometric exercises with light to medium weights. Alison is leading 2 other trainers through the moves; with one of them showing the low impact version. The only thing I didn't like was the camera stayed focused too long on the trainer performing the low impact moves; so when Alison changes to the high impact move the camera is still on the trainer performing the low impact moves. Therefore I gave it 4 stars.

I would recommend this workout.",1374537600,,547,4.571428571428571

2713425,4,B000LSBXF2,"I like the friendly instructor and her instructions are pretty good. This workout uses only one set of light weights, and I miss the use of heavier weights.  I get a little confused with some of the footwork combined with the arm movements.  I am nearly 64 and in pretty good shape for my age, but this workout includes some squat thrusts, which are a little difficult at my age. I can't quite keep up with her during the thrusts, and I am cautious of my back during these moves.  Otherwise, it is another good Firm workout which is a little more modern than their originals (which I love).",1366243200,,590,4.394495412844036
2713426,5,B000LSBXF2,"This is a great workout.  It's not easy but it's worth it!  Not too dancy like some of The Firm workouts.  All you need are dumbbells, water, and a fan.  You're going to sweat your butt off!",1365552000,,190,4.054054054054054

2713428,5,B000LSBXF2,"Allison Davis is quickly becoming my favorite Firm instructor.  I have done this workout several times and I like it more and more each time.  Of course, I am also able to keep up better and better each time too.  It's a tough, but fun workout.  Lots of cardio and some work with weights too.  I'd recommend this one for sure!  I do agree with some other commenters about the weird camera work, though.  I can remember at least once when a new move is being introduced, the camera isn't even on Allison and so you don't really know what to do.  Other than that, I have nothing negative to say about this one.

I did this one again this morning and I'm adding a star.  Like I said, I like it more and more each time I do it!",1352678400,,723,4.1
2713429,1,B000LSBXF2,"I have some of the older Firm workouts and really enjoy them. More recently I have been doing local bootcamps and P90x, based on the good reviews I purchased the Firm Get Chisel'd and the Bootcamp Maximum Calorie Burn for a change of pace. I felt like some of the exercises were unsafe and really did not get a good workout. Depending on what you are looking for these might be good workouts but they are not for me and I will be taking them to Goodwill!",1352332800,3,454,4.2298850574712645
2713430,5,B000LSBXF2,"As I stated in another Firm workout review, reviews are relative based on your exercise preferences and levels, and what you are looking for in a workout. I run 30-55 miles per week and have done workouts for decades. I like serious, efficient workouts. I don't expect to dislike them or for them to be monotonous, but I don't expect to be entertained. I get and use different ones for different purposes and variety. To get the best results, buy the right one for your level and outcome preferences. This workout is for cardio with sculpting - and that's what it does.  You'll get a mix of cardio and sculpting. As your level increases, increase the weights and your effort (squat and lunge lower, jump and kick higher).
I have used The Firm and Tony Horton workouts (P90x guy) for decades. They are the best for a home workout. Allison (this workout's Instructor), Rebekah and Allie (other Firm Instructors) are great no-nonsense instructors. They are like personal trainers. They are not like cheerleaders. If you need a lot of distractions and entertainment, those home workouts exist. These, though, deliver results.",1337731200,4,1121,4.9

The format of this workout is broken up into two types of segments--cardio and plyometrics.  Overall, it's a good workout and does get you sweating quite a bit.  However, the instructor is the reason that I only give this video 2 stars.  Although, I don't care for peppy instructors, this one was quite the opposite extreme.  She had no energy whatsoever and the most annoying part was that she referred to Sue Mi, the lady doing the modified moves a thousand times!!!  The only reason that I can think of why she would refer to Sue Mi so many times is because she was nervous and was looking for fillers.  It really deters me from wanting to work out to this DVD.",1320278400,,750,4.35251798561151

I agree with a previous comment that the camera work is little to be desired (which is why I am rating it a 4).

I added this one to my rotation 2 days a week and I have noticed a huge difference in the inches I have lost and my muscle definition.  This dvd is not for beginners or people who are not familiar with the Firm's terminology.  That being said, with practice and persistence you can still get the hang of this if you are new to the Firm but work out regularly.

Allison is my favorite instructor because she gives great cues and explains the correct form.  The girl is in serious shape!  Anybody that can do this dvd and still verbally guide you through this tough work out w/o being out of breath is in great shape!!  People have complained about having to pick up weights and put them down frequently to go through the segments in this dvd.  If I am not mistaken, that is what circuit training is.

With any new exercise dvd I get, I always watch it through once to get a feel for what I will be doing.  After having completed the dvd twice, I had the moves down pat.  It is easy to follow, but it works you out hard.  You will be dripping in sweat by the end and you will feel totally energized.",1311033600,4,1159,4.147982062780269

Alison has become one of my favorite instructors because she explains the moves, has fairly good cueing, and keeps me motivated during the workout.  That being said, you can definitely tell this is one of her earlier DVDs as she seems a little nervous and wooden during the transitions.  The workout itself is nicely divided up between sculpting/plyometric segments and cardio segments.  Each plyometric move is repeated twice during sculpting and is just long enough to make your muscles burn without making you want to quit.  The sculpting and cardio exercises are pretty basic Firm moves, with variations for beginners and advanced exercisers.

2713452,4,B000LSBXF2,"I've been trying to convince myself to try the Firm for a long time but haven't mustered the courage.  I don't know; something about the pink cases with Barbie-doll instructors made me think it wasn't going to be a real workout.  So when I finally took the plunge and picked this one up, I was ambivalent.
Sigh of relief-this workout is a lot of fun!  I enjoyed myself the whole way through and felt great afterwords.  There were a few places where I didn't understand the motion, but I actually liked that because I just substituted some of my favorite cardio moves that were not featured in the video.  The sequencing is great to keep you interested and prevent injury, boredom, or just getting worn out.
I agree with some of the posts that the instruction sounds uncomfortable and a bit robotic, but this didn't really bother me since I was having so much fun doing the moves.",1296259200,,879,4.537974683544304

If you read the back of the DVD, the purpose of this workout is to burn fat with bootcamp training and cardio drills, and that's exactly what it is. I wanted a good hour long workout to get my heart rate up and burn some serious calories, and this DVD delivered!  Alison is one of the BEST instructors as far as cuing and counting out the moves precisely. The plyometrics can be intense, but the modifications are great if you have bad knees or hips!  I highly recommend this DVD!  I also purchased the 500 Calorie Burn DVD, and didn't really like it.  The cuing was WAY off to the beat of the music and hard to follow.  This DVD, however, is a great calorie burning workout!!!",1295222400,2,908,4.337278106508876
2713454,5,B000LSBXF2,"I've been doing the Firm since the late 90's, and I love the original tapes as well as most of the permutations in between.  I think this new series with Allison (and the ones with Allie!) is just terrific, giving a great cardio workout in about 50 minutes.  I especially love the ""diagonal"" moves, across the body, which none of the early Firm workouts really has.  If you want ""jelly"" muscles, you probably need to do Tough Tape, Tough Tape Two, Total Body Workout, Aerobic Body Shaping or Cardio Sculpt with Allie, and/or Body Sculpt with Jen Carmen or Stephanie.  But for an all-over fast workout that will tap some new muscles, increase your flexibility, wring out a nice sweat, and won't make your downstairs neighbors want to kill you, this workout is excellent.  Ultimate Fat Burning Workout has a slightly different emphasis (and even more across the body moves) and is also a great workout.  On days when I don't want any weights, I adore Cardio Dance Fusion, but beware, it's exactly the same as Cardio Dance Express, so don't waste your money, and write the Firm a nasty note about that.",1295049600,3,1099,4.668393782383419
2713465,5,B000LSBXF2,"This is the only DVD I've been consistently able to workout with for over 3 years.  I discovered this workout about 3 years ago when I was training for a marathon and I was surprised to see that my body transformed more with this video and a little bit of running than just running alone.  I don't like dancing or crazy moves, I just want a good workout, and this was very easy to follow.  There is a small learning curve at first, like all workout videos, but it didn't take but 2 or 3 tries before I had it down.  She is great because the moves don't get too repetitious (all within about 8 reps each) and she gives tips on how to make it easier and harder.  I like that she will slow things down and speed things up for a nice interval training.  There are a few times where she goes a little fast, but the point is to keep moving.  This is the only Firm video I have liked, and I think it is the easiest to follow.  You will see results if you stick with this, just like the DVD guarantees.",1290902400,3,994,4.035714285714286

Usually when I do weight segments, my heart rate stays relatively steady, but not with this one!  I was sweating buckets, and my muscles were burning...that is my definition of a workout!  I love the circuit training style of FIRM workouts, because my body doesn't get tired of doing the same thing.  I also save money on gym memberships, and I don't have to worry about people watching me.  This was actually the first FIRM DVD I purchased back in 2008...and I couldn't finish it the first two times, but I kept at it and needless to say, my cardio strength has improved tremendously!",1268006400,,703,4.629032258064516

Definitely recommend for intermediate to advanced exercisers....Love The Firm workouts! They are tough, but effective! LOVE IT!!",1264723200,,421,4.943661971830986
2713468,3,B000LSBXF2,"This workout is fun to do. It is a mixture of cardio, plyometrics, and sculpting.  It moves quickly and hits most of the major muscle groups.  The workout is targeted for intermediates.  Sue Mi shows beginner modifications but there really is not enough instruction given for a beginner to execute the exercises properly.

The only equipment that is required is hand weights (light, medium, and heavy).

The cardio was relatively easy to pick up and follow.  This is not a dance style cardio workout and the moves are not very complex.  That said, the routines do raise the heart rate.  The plyometrics was pretty disappointing.  The instructor slowly builds up to the full move.  This is really unecessary because, really, how difficult is it to learn mountain climbers?  That time spent building up to the real move is time that could have been spent burning more calories. Once I did the routine once, I just did the full move from the beginning.

A major problem with this video is that the camera work is pretty terrible. The instructor will explain a new leg exercise but the camera will remain focused on the upper body.  Or the instructor will explain a beginners or advanced modification and the camera will not be focused on the appropriate person.  This happens many many times during the video.

Another problem I had with this video is a lack of instruction on proper form or sufficient camera angling to show the move from different sides.  In my opinion, this renders this video inappropriate for beginners.

I really wish I could give this video a higher rating because it is a lot of fun to do but unfortunately, there are too many major short comings.",1264464000,12,1669,4.739583333333333

I don't workout on a regular basis at all; if it's nice outside I'll go running maybe 2-3 x's per month. I was looking for a workout I could do in my small apartment, that would give me the best results.

I've only had this for a few days now, but I can say that it's one of the best workouts I've ever had! From start to finish, my heart rate is up and I'm sweating/working like crazy, but it's still fun somehow! I know previous reviews mentioned that they don't like having to pick up the weights, put them down, pick them up again, etc. but I think that mixing up the different kinds of exercise makes it easier to keep up.

I would not recommend this for someone who is an absolute beginner to exercise, as it's a lot of (fast paced) jumps, squats, lunges, and weights. If you're looking for something inexpensive that will really whip you into shape (this guarantees visible results after 10 workouts!) then definitely give this dvd a try!",1263254400,,1043,4.343589743589743

This workout alternates three sections of plyometric moves (weight training plus some power moves without weights like jumped scissors or jumps combined with push-ups) and three cardio units.
The cardio units are mostly typical aerobic moves with some nice modifications (hooks, kicks and in the last one a jump called ""shooting the basket""). Before the last cardio section you're almost ready to give up, but the music is so motivating and funny, that you put all your energy you have at this moment into it for this last part.
The cool down (with core training) is very good choreographed and is one flow. No hurry, no standing up, lying down and so on, just one flow.
The cuing is very good, but sometimes they're showing the beginner exercises a little bit to often.

The total length is about 50 minutes.

As equipment, you need three pairs of dumbbells.

I wouldn't recommend this one to a beginner. I consider myself a very solid intermediate and I struggled at times.

In fact, I would tell anyone starting this video to start out with only very light weights (or none at all).  I'm in very good shape (I work out 1-2 hours every day), and this video is a challenge.  When I first started it, it would leave me so sore that I'd have to avoid working out for 2-3 days after (I was using weights heavier than I should have used).  Since I've started using lighter weights, it doesn't leave me crazy-sore the next day, but I can definitely feel it in my muscles.  The combination of weights and cardio bursts is great- my heart rate stays up the whole time, and I sweat like nuts!  I think this is especially good for toning lower body problem areas- the hips, [...], and inner and outer thighs.  But there is a lot of upper body work too, so just up the weight if you're looking to tone more of your upper body.

Again- I can't recommend this enough!  Perfect for when you can't make it to the gym or the weather isn't good enough to go for a run.",1216166400,3,1143,4.25

2713517,4,B000LSBXF2,"""The Firm Bootcamp: Maximum Calorie Burn"" is a challenging, total body workout that pretty much hits the ground running and doesn't let up until it's over! From warmup to cooldown, it is about 50 minutes.
The long-ish warmup (I think it is about 9 minutes) wastes no time in heating you up quickly using squats, bob-and-weaves, push-ups and some active stretching.
The program itself is a rotation of Plyometrics (short, strong jumping alternated with fast-paced weight toning) followed by straight, undiluted Cardio.  This is repeated 3 times.  (The only thing about the Plyo sections is that there is a lot of picking up and putting down the weights.  This is one of the reasons that I actually prefer The Firm's ""Ultimate Fat Burning Workout"" lead by the same insructor, Alison Davis.  Much less picking up and putting down!) Each segment is about 5 minutes (i.e. Plyometrics for 5 min., followed by Cardio for 5 min., etc.).
The Cardio sections are not dance-y at all;  very athletic-drill/bootcamp oriented (if you're not panting and dripping sweat after the first rotation, you're either an American Gladiator or an alien!). You will do  tire drills, punches, front kicks, side kicks, lunges and squats with fun variations and jumping of all kinds. (That dip-press-dip-hop in the 2nd Plymetric section is STILL a killer after 3 months of using this workout...though my legs are on fire at the END now as opposed to the beginning!)
In true Firm fashion, even the 10 minute cooldown is active, so even though your heartrate is slowly coming down, you are still working muscles and still burning fat all the way to the end.  This particular cooldown provides an excellent waist/upper abs/lower abs workout.
The insructor, Alison Davis, is calm and encouraging with a slight southern twang. (I believe that The Firm is based out of South Carolina, so a lot of their instructors have this.) This is a highly recommended workout that will leave you with a sculpted, sexy body quickly!

When you first start this video out, you might think that this won't get you sweating, but after about 5-10 min. you'll feel the burn and your heart will be pumping. I use a Polar Heart Rate monitor w/a built in calorie counter that does the calculatoins based on the actual heart rate and just in this video alone, I burn approximately 700 calories. Some may burn more or less, based on individual abilities and physical conditions, but the point is... you just burn a lot and your sports bra will be soaked with sweat.

I decided to go with Beachbody DVDs instead (with Debbie Siebers). They are challenging, yet easy to follow with lots of repetition (not changing moves too quickly, unlike the Firm). I'm a seasoned exerciser, but my body was too used to the treadmill. I needed a change. Beachbody has given me great results and people compliment me all the time on my body (I'm 36 and a mother of 2 boys).

I am very athletic and in good shape, but I needed something to boost my energy and tone up by muscles at home.

I also could barely walk the next day because my [...] was so sore...but all worth it for the results! My arms are also starting to look more defined. The cardio is also great. I wasn't looking to lose any weight, just tone up, but it looks like I might drop a few pounds as well.

I found this to be more cardio based but the weight work you do helps to elevate your heart rate and keep it pumped through the entire workout.  I found the moves easy to follow the first time through, not for beginners just starting out, you would want to do the beginner segment for the first few runs through to get your moves down.  I found the instructor fun and very motivating.  This workout lasts 52 minutes and was a real sweaty experience.

However, the pace was too fast and the moves changed too often to be giving a good workout to a beginner like myself.  Plus, the camera angles, as some other reviews mentioned, made it even harder to follow.  If they had not advertised this as easy to follow, I wouldn't be so disappointed.  I recently started following another dvd, Ultimate Fat Burn by Women's Health&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Women-s-Health-Ultimate-Fat-Burn/dp/B000SM6FIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Women's Health: Ultimate Fat Burn!</a>, and that was a much better example of a good workout for beginners.

This video will get your heart pumping and leave you sweating after the work-out.  I agree with most reviewers in that the camera work is not very good, when it should be on the trainer it's on the modifier (Sue Mi).  Oh, and it gets very annoying after the 15th time when the instructor tells you: ""for all you beginners follow:Sue Mi""  I guess she doesn't have much to say.....

The plyometrics and cardio segments are super charged and even though it is lacking in upper body moves, this tape alternated with other Firm sculpting tapes is the total package.  I must admit the production is cheap and the music is strange at the beginning, but Allison is very personable just like Allie so I think this will be one I will be doing for a while!!!!",1197331200,,542,4.635416666666667

I found that the transitions between the cardio and strength training segments were weak.  It was aggravating having to do cardio, then pick up the weights, then drop the weights, then do more cardio, then pick up the weights every two minutes. It was quiet annoying after a while.

Also, while I love most of the instructors I've seen with The FIRM, Alison Davis just seemed so stiff and robotic for me.  When she mentioned how our ""guns"" were going to look, I couldn't help but crack up at the absurdity of her comment.  It's one thing to hear my thirteen year old students (I'm a teacher) mention that, but it just seemed so foreign coming out of her mouth.

On a positive note, I loved how the workout was divided up into chapters, and I did work up quiet a sweat, but overall, it's not a keeper for me.",1197072000,4,899,4.321428571428571

I am 60 and work out for about 1 hour each AM before going to work and this fits perfectly in my schedule.  I have a lot of the earlier firm videos but was beginning to get bored and actually like these very new ones better with the new moves and mix of cardio and weights.

I have to admit I was really surprised at how tough this workout is, especially since the weights used are pretty light.  But the moves are also fairly basic, Alison cues really well, and the beginner class member does a great job, making it pretty easy to follow the workout and to take it down a notch or two if necessary.

I love the fact that the weight training segments are broken up with power moves because my heart rate stays higher than it otherwise would and I can feel my muscles being worked in different ways.  My thighs are on fire every time I do that dip press/hop series!  I also think the cardio is tough but a lot of fun, especially the kickboxing and the song with the tire runs and the shoot the basket move.  The standing and floor ab routines at the end were great too!",1192406400,,865,4.2439024390243905

Allison gives exellent cueing, and even though the steps are easy to follow, the workout is pretty intermediate. Perfect for those who want good cardio, with light toning. But you can always heavy up the weights if you want a more challanging workout! The workout does have ""plyo"" sections, however, fun toning is incorporated into the workout as well. And the plyos are broken down into small sections, and they have new plyp moves as well-like the ski and slope move! I give this workout a grade A and all you need is a pair of light, and medium or heavy dumbells!

However, I had trouble keeping my balance and keeping up with the pace of parts of the video at the same time. Other than this, it is a very good workout. I love how there is plenty of variety, and it's nice that they have a ""beginner's version"" for those that have not done certain types of exercise in awhile. Most workout videos leave me extremely sore because I don't know much about ""warming up"", but this one seemed to incorporate everything. I worked up a great sweat and on top of that, I was only very slightly sore the next day. I'm going to keep doing this video and see if it really burns calories. Franky, for a 52 minute video that incorporates ab toning exercises as well as cardio, and plyos, I can't imagine how I could not be burning calories.",1188604800,,882,4.287425149700598
2713577,2,B000LSBXF2,"This title has so many problems I really marvel at it.  The Firm usually puts out very high quality videos, but what were they thinking with this one?  The first thing you will notice is that the instructor is actually nervous.  Her introduction is awkward and stiff, and she maintains that for most of the video.  Second, why oh why does the camera not just stay in front of the group so that you can see what everyone is doing the whole time??!!  You will see the beginner modifier so often you'll want to throw a shoe at your tv.  And the camera will cut away from the instructor at the WORST times...she'll say (for the nth time) ""Beginners follow Sue Mi"", the camera will cut to the other girl, and then the instructor will call out a modifier for the advanced folks.  Guess where the camera stays!  On Sue Mi.  And there are many times that moves are switched up and they are only showing the top half of the instructor.  Very frustrating.  Also, the workout is divided into sections in a way that is just dumb.  The sections are labeled ""Cardio"" or ""Plyo"", etc. but it is essentially the same stuff over and over again.  I mean, when you see a title ""Plyometrics 1"" you expect to do some heart pumping jumping around.  But no.  And the music?  It couldn't get more uninspiring.  Even given all of that, I would keep this workout if it were even remotely fun.  But it isn't.  It's boring.  I couldn't get all the way through it.

So I purchased this one for something a little different--frankly, although I do recognize the value of leg presses on the Step or Fanny Lifter, sometimes I'd rather not climb on that thing one more time!
And I wanted to ratchet it up a bit. And this does. It isn't too hard to follow, if you are already familiar with the basic moves, although the cueing could be a bit better in places. That doesn't really detract from the routine however. The camera work, which is problematic at times in many of the videos, has the same issues here. When transitioning steps or amping up to the power step, it really doesn't help to focus on the gal doing the beginner steps, or hip up when my feet are doing something new.
This is only in a few places though, and isn't hard to figure out, just a bit confusing.
I did get what I paid for, and am excited to learn the routine and get through the entire thing without pyramiding down here and there.
Definitely worth the effort and the money.",1183680000,8,1065,4.325

Although I felt like I got a good workout and it was a nice change from the other 20 Firms that I've done, the camera work was just too amateur.  At times, it focused on the girl with the easy moves so you could not follow along with the regular instructors.  Also, there were times you could not see the leg work because it focused only on the upper half of the instructors.  Whoever shot this video needs to learn from the original Firm camera people, who really knew how to shoot a workout video.  However, I liked the plyometrics and speed moves because I felt I was going at different paces throughout the video and that is supposed to give you results faster.

The next day soreness was tolerable less than it would be if I took a run, but my legs and butt felt taunt and tone the rest of the week.

It is 52 minutes total, and it FLIES.  The combination of cardio, plyo and weight work is great.  (Warning though.. if you have bad knees, there is alot of squatting involved).  I have done this workout about eight times and it keeps getting better.. you know you have a great workout on your hands if you feel that workout ""buzz"" several hours after you have performed it, and sleep like a baby at night.

I agree that if you want more of an upper body burn you may want to bump up the weights.  I didn't have any problems following the moves.  The instructor gives great cues.

2713628,2,B000LSBXF2,"It's a lot more difficult following moves in a video than in a live class. A good video addresses this issue by either offering an introductory segment outlining the moves that will be used during the exercise or showing the moves slowly before launching into the exercise. With ""The Firm Bootcamp"", it would be best to offer a section that goes through the various arm and leg movements in slow motion so we can get those down first rather than try to learn them while keeping our heart rate up...which I find impossible. I am not the most coordinated person in the world, especially when it comes to doing different things with my arms and legs at the same time and I know there are a lot of folks like me out there. It is extremely frustrating when the instructor (Alison Davis) is going through the moves at a lightning pace and just as I get one batch down, she adds more and more. I do not understand why such a large number of combinations need to be used at once when simple power moves would work just as well if not better because the person isn't stumbling trying to figure out what to do next. This is the third The firm video I've tried and I'm quite disgusted. I thought perhaps it was the step in the trans-firmer series that was tripping me up (literally), but I've found I'm stumbling around even without the step. They simply add way too many moves at too quick of a pace for someone new to this type of work-out to learn and follow properly.

I find the Tae Bo and Get Ripped videos to be much easier to follow and I get just as good of a workout if not more so. If I put Billy Blanks on mute and turn my own music on, I have no problems because the moves are SIMPLE and straight forward. I've never owned a video that played good music in the background and every instructor's voice gets old to listen to after awhile, so it is nice to be able to mute it and put on my own workout music. I can't do this with The Firm, because the moves change too much and I'm forced to listen to that god awful excuse for electronica in the background. One thing I love about the Ripped and Tae Bo videos is they drop the cliche girly aerobic moves and add some real ""punch"" to the workout. The Firm chooses to use overly complex boring combinations that I do not find motivating or empowering.  Not all females want to be dancers.

Also, there is a lot of emphasis on squats and lunges (the lower body), but not enough on the upper body or the abs. The abs section was decent, but I really didn't feel the burn.

I gave it 2 stars because it is a decent workout if you are familiar with the moves and can follow along.",1177804800,7,2624,4.221115537848606

For example, in the amount of time that it would take to do four deep reverse lunges safely, she instead has you do eight quick shallow ones. Traditionally, The Firm has three categories of workouts: Sculpting (primarily weights and little to no cardio), Cardio+Sculpting (a balance of weights and cardio), and Cardio (which can include some light weights but used only to increase the heart rate as opposed to building muscle). This workout seems to be a blend that doesn't quite work--it's like ""We're going to classify this as Cardio+Sculpting by throwing in some sculpting moves with medium weights, but then we're going to go too fast for you to actually use a full range of motion or to do the moves safely.""",1499126400,,937,4.684848484848485
