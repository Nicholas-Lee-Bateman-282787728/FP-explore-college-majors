7970595,3,B00006JSOJ,"This is a good VHS tape with some common sense psychological principles about improving relationships.  One can learn not to take things personally if the other partner is not always happy.  Your partner may not be angry with you.  John Gray's advise to be supportive and not always the problem solver is on the money. Men need to realize women need empathy.  And a lot of I Love You's too. Another good point for women is not to change a man.  Except him for who he is or move on.
Other points to share feelings and not to intimidate each other stand strong.  Even more important, don't embarrass a man if he does not do everything you want him to do.  You will scare him away.  Receive each call with a smile.
The drawbacks are that John Gray just talks on and on with barely any interaction with the audience or the lady host.  His speaking manner is a bit neurotic at times and hard to deal with if you are not in the mood.  Also the cinematography is hard to look at.  A blurry appearance indeed with little color in the background.  Even the camera man cuts off John Gray's head on a few occasions.
Good advise but be patient with the visuals and the general audio.  They may be a little hard to endure.",1046476800,,1209,4.29646017699115
