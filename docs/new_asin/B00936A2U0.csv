5253846,5,B00936A2U0,"This a beautifully crafted film. The two stars shine, Standwyck in particular, is amazing in her role as  a wise and empathetic  adoption caregiver. The basic plot is centered around Cagney's character (now a millionaire) searching for his lost son. Yet, what  made this film powerful is the poignant emerging subplot that has it's climax toward the end of the film. A brief but powerful scene.which shows Cagney at his best: emotional and beautifully vulnerable.",1406073600,3,463,5.1466666666666665
5253847,5,B00936A2U0,Love this movie. Standwyck is so believable in this roll. Cagney was too. It is a no 1 picture for me.,1406073600,2,102,3.9047619047619047
5253848,5,B00936A2U0,Cagney and Stanwyck at their very best; this film should be far more widely-known than it is.  May I give away the fact that there is the obligatory happy ending under a Christmas tree?,1393804800,2,185,4.4411764705882355
5253849,5,B00936A2U0,"I have to say I am a fan of both James Cagney and Barbara Stanwyck. When I happened to see that they made a movie together, I figure how could I go wrong? Well I was right. this movie was fantastic. The plot was well thought of and well written. Then put two power houses like Cagney and Stanwyck together and you have a great entertainment for sure. Cagney plays a wealthy man who has almost everything. the one thing he lacks is the child he fathered when he was in high school that was given up for adoption. Now that he has all the money in the world, he decides he wants to track down his long lost child. He meets up with Ms Stanwyck who plays the head of the adoption agency and the battle begins. A great story with a wonderful ending.......",1392508800,2,749,4.172413793103448
5253850,4,B00936A2U0,"It's unusual to find tough actor star Cagney in soap opera type tale..why would he make such a vehicle especially since months prior it was announced to be filmed by different actors. Cagney rose to stardom at warner's but left it being one of the top stars, to start his own production company, but those films never seemed to make their way, and he returned to warner's in films like White Heat and Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye(banned in Ohio the stated reason"" a sordid
sadistic presentation of brutality and an extreme presentation of crime..explicit steps in commission)..and he left the studio again in the mid 50's and in 1956 saw hinself in this film. It was meant to focus I believe on young persons and was announced to star Debbie Reynolds called All our Tomorrows..then recalled Somewhere I'll Find Him..then released under a different name with different stars. Miss Reynolds was unavailable when filming started and here we have Cagney a business tycoon, who finds himself alone and reflects on his past life, and recalls a young girl with whom he has a child and a lost son and seeks them out. At an orphanage. He is tough in ways and dislikes the dreamy sentiment of the orphanage director played by Stanwyck(her role is minor here) and whatever the film was in its minor stages, here the tale focuson Cagney and his psychology, the modern courts and even Superior courts, and what drives this man to seek out young girls and children, and why the system in this case refuses to knuckle in to him. The courts really took over jurisdiction and care over children, from religious establishments..and here's a character who laces judgements all around and is always referred to as Mr..and younger girls are well disposed toward him and he meets a 16 year old with child who ends up in a crash...eventually he loses his case in courts, but the orphanage allows him to meet his child, and although the state system he's not much happy with, he's used to dealing with life he feels in a fair way, he returns to give thanks, he's a person who expresses gratitude, and ther are christmas scenes, him buying presents, and the film ends at christmas with him helping a young girl, while trying to help his kid, by the force of his own personality. These were wilder years..in many ways he's a throwback to the past..his center..disposed toward youger girls and children...in a modern world. Perhaps he was attracted to this subject, a character who states in the film his friends were perhaps before the world was ever made..but he's mr. ...the ancient mind in the modern world...wanting to make all good..Stanwyck doesnt have that much to do does it irk her that the film is written with Cagney in mind,..his nest films on his agenda were Short cut to hell, man of a thousand faces, Never steal anything small and Shake hands with the Devil...but he made room for this soap opera type tale...of the spirit of christmas in someone",1351209600,,2929,4.72265625
5253851,5,B00936A2U0,"My husband usually gripes about watching old movies; ""They are boring or sappy.""

This movie deals with a contemporary issue - teenage pregnancy and adoption. It packs a punch without throwing in sex scenes and loud cursing-out fights.

Instead, the story is told with great acting - facial movements, speaking with the eyes and body language. James Cagney is one of my favourite actors - he is such a versatile actor and I love his vulnerability in this film.

The entire film is well cast and after reading some reviews, it was interesting to catch Tom Laughlin (would never have recognised him); still haven't seen Michael Landon - just gives me another reason to watch it again.",1435881600,,682,4.811965811965812

5253857,4,B00936A2U0,"THESE WILDER YEARS (1956) is an MGM drama with Jimmy Cagney, Barbara Stanwyck, Walter Pidgeon and Edward Andrews
(if you don't know the name he's a familiar character actor). Dean Jones has a hardware store clerk cameo.

The most interesting uncrediteds are (in his movie debut) Michael Landon (poolhall boy)
also Tom Laughlin (football player), better known to us as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BILLY-JACK/dp/B0029Z8K7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BILLY JACK</a>.

The plot's fairly straightforward.
Cagney's a very successful industrialist who regrets something he did 20 years earlier: not accepting responsibility for a girlfriend's pregnancy. He walked away, she gave their son up for adoption, and now all these years later Jimmy wants to finally meet his only child. Preventing this reunion is Stanwyck, a social worker who's determined that the lives of the son and his foster parents will not be disrupted by Cagney.

An important subplot (one that we can see the denouement of well in advance) involves a young
lady, an unwed mother-to-be, who will soon give birth and turn her child over to the State.

There's a hearing before a judge that turns nasty and an anticipated sad finale.
It's a really good late career film for Jimmy.

Currently rated 6.8 at IMDb.",1412899200,,1317,5.565
5253858,5,B00936A2U0,Amazing movie it's about James Cagney he plays a man who looking for his son that was adopted over 20years ago and want him to get to know him. He's a rich man and wanted to leave to his son but the place were he finds that adoption he makes friends with a young girl that was going to give up her baby up cause she was 16 years old that's not the only reason the girl really wanted to keep her child but she felt that she had no means to take care the baby. James really care for the girl and got to know the girl and knew that she didn't really want to have to give her child up. While he was going to court to find out that he would get what he wanted. He lives the court he walked to a place and his son walks in to meet him. He talked to him. And felt James goes to the place where he was staying to find out the girl was hit by a car accident but she was asking for him the doctor told her that she would die if she wouldn't have the operation James talk her into it. Everything was fine after. She had a boy named it after him. He took her with him. Happy ending.,1411171200,,1070,3.76
5253859,5,B00936A2U0,Decided to watch just for Cagney & Stanwyck but glad I did. Beautiful movie. Well done all around. LOVED IT.,1409097600,,108,4.45
5253860,5,B00936A2U0,"When something works well, sometimes it's hard to point out exactly why.  In this case, of course,  we have two famous  stars at the top of their form, and an exceptional  supporting cast that is given much deserved close-up photography of their wonderful character work. Such as the lawyers, the doctors, the cabdrivers, and the sister played by Dorothy Adams. Except for actor  Dean Jones whose
excellent  work  was filmed from across the room, bless him, and whose profile thus  isn't recognizable but will be in other films. Walter Pidgeon as the heavyweight lawyer in a very impressive pinstripe suit is a joy to listen to, with that heavyweight voice.

Issues in the story are clearly stated.

The story is suspenseful in its own way, and I for one am glad to see Mr. Cagney portray, not  a gangster, but  someone who deliberately  missed an opportunity to be a dad. Some subtle stuff here

 Nice photography of the young lady, Betty Lou Keim, who makes her film debut in this one, nice graceful work on her part, so believable.  What happened to this actress ?  Other films?

Miss Stanwyck  is a classic star.  She  tells the story oftentimes with ""just one look."" She has a classically mesmerizing face,if one may say so,  very mobile. She gives us ""portraits"" of the character she portrays. Also, lots of skill in moving in front of the camera. Regarding ""is the story written to show off Mr. Cagney"" , often a story pivots on excellence in a role that is small or smaller than.  As here.

So, fix yourself a nice cup of tea and settle back for some value, strength, strong character, and lots of  art.

Great art is the art that conceals how it's done.  Enjoy this one.",1408492800,10,1679,4.58445945945946
8535029,5,B00936A2U0,"Absolutely one of James Cagneys best roles!! Always great at putting his heart and soul into his roles, he doesn't disappoint. He goes from hard steely ""I'm going to get what I want"" to teddy bear in seamlessly. Wish there were more great actors like him, but mostly wish we still had him.",1502150400,,289,4.471698113207547

8535031,4,B00936A2U0,Put within the context of the time it was filmed I found it to be a good morality play type of movie and found myself yearning for the days when things like adoption (the young pregnant teenage girl) could be that simple.,1468454400,,221,4.285714285714286

8535035,3,B00936A2U0,Cagney is good as well the rest of the cast but the story is very sappy and predictable. It could have been a Lifetime movie for it's time. Stanwick and Cagney were way more fun in the 30's.,1440028800,,190,4.026315789473684
