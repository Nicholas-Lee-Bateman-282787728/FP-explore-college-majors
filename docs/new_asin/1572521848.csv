7797716,5,1572521848,"In preparation for a trip to Bhutan, I have read all that is available (just about) on the Bhutanese form of the religion, but this gorgeous video brought it to life in an instant. I highly recommend it--my only complaint is that the Bhutan segment is only 25 minutes long--but it's worth every penny!",998352000,,301,4.592592592592593
7797717,5,1572521848,"Mystic Lands--as respects the first part on Bhutan--is a great addition to the Living Eden tape, also about Bhutan.  They both compliment each other since Living Eden is more about the land and nature.  With this tape you  get more focus on the actual Bhutanese peope.  You see their faces,  clothing, children and get a good glimpse of their colorful festivals.  These are things I look forward to seeing when I visit next month for the  first time.  It will also probably be a nice synopsis of my trip to be able  to review again with others on my return.  Highly recommended by me AND my  travel agent who viewed this as well.",934502400,9,629,4.477876106194691
