7759115,5,B01G9CFRPU,"Good TV Show. DVD Case not doing what it should, holding DVD in its place. DVD all over the place maybe the reason why scratched
DVD No. 1 Pilot Movie and 2nd Movie freezing. DVD No. 2-4 working fine. That is why only 3 stars otherwise I would give 5 Stars

Did get a replacement free of charge from amazon, the Cd's are ok now. very happy with show and service of Amazon. Thank You",1469577600,,382,4.093333333333334

7759120,5,B01G9CFRPU,Excellent.  Never knew this existed - but great.  Should have been a long term series.,1484697600,,86,4.666666666666667
7759121,3,B01G9CFRPU,"Three stars for James Arness.  He is still a presence on the screen.  The other actors all need improvement.  We stopped watching when the show increased its sleaze factor with Markie Post doing some sort of Hooker/undercover function. If that does not bother you and you will watch almost anything to see Marshal Dillon again, go for it.",1482105600,2,338,4.793103448275862
7759122,5,B01G9CFRPU,Fair fare. Marshall Dillon still looks like he just rode in from the range. Go Jim !,1482019200,,84,4.0

7759127,5,B01G9CFRPU,As a long time fan of James Arness I was thrilled to find this on Amazon.  As retired/newly hired lawman Jim McClain there is so much of Marshall Dillon in the character.  Always fighting for justice.  After watching him play Marshall Dillon on Gunsmoke for 20 years it's a little weird watching him in a different role but he's still wonderful to watch.,1473897600,7,354,4.587301587301587

7759136,5,B01G9CFRPU,"You can't go wrong, watching any TV series in which James Arness is the lead.  However, it is indeed ""strange"" to watch him riding a car, instead of a horse...",1470787200,,159,4.3
7759137,3,B01G9CFRPU,"It was interesting to see James Arness play a modern role.  We are all so used to him being Marshall Matt Dillon for 20 years.  The series was fun to watch and I enjoyed his performance as a tough detective with  compassion and concern for others.  Sounds familiar, doesn't it?  The storylines were just ""OK"" and I can see how it wasn't renewed for additional years.  Enjoyed watching it and I'm glad I purchased it.",1470441600,3,416,4.48

8762672,5,B01G9CFRPU,"Arness is great.  I wonder if it was his idea to stop this series because he was obviously having difficulty with his leg.  For those who don't know Arness was machine gunned by the Nazis in WWII.  I can't be unbiased about this super guy.  What a career he had.  See ""The Thing from Another World"" (he was the thing).  See ""Big Jim McClain"" (he was John Wayne's sidekick).  He fought giant ants in ""Them"".  I can watch Arness in anything!!!",1488844800,5,441,4.3580246913580245

8762674,5,B01G9CFRPU,"This is a well acted police series with a talented cast of actors and great storylines. So, why was it canceled after a single season and a mere 15 episodes? Well, if I had to guess, it's competition on rival network CBS, was just too much! The Dukes of Hazzard was in the top ten that season!  I blame it on stuff competition and NOT on the quality of this series. It had all the elements of a hit series!",1486857600,,406,4.075
