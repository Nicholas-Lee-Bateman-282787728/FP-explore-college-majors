2998197,3,B000X418V8,"Maybe it's a Kiwi thing.

The story of gawky Lilly and misfit Jarrod is not enough to pull along this thin tale. If you find ""Flight of the Conchords"" funny, you may enjoy this movie. If you don't get it, the film may not appear to you. The dude from Conchords is just flat-out . . . not funny. Delivering his lines in a flat monotone, he conveys the emotional range of an Intel microprocessor.

The New Zealand accents are so thick that, at time, American viewers would appreciate English subtitles (which I later learned are actually available with the DVD - consider activating).  I don't think I laughed (or even chuckled) once the whole 90 minutes. The scenes of Jarrod training for his upcoming confrontation are pathetic - more like a gay Rocky...  The notion that this guy would fight his way out of a paper bag is ludicrous.  He is as intimidating as a poodle with a spiked collar, or Barry Manilow brandishing a man-purse.  I could have done without the scene where the hapless Jarrod beats a wheelchair-bound rival - a fat Samoan -- with nunchuk sticks.

Funny? Not ...

I've seen worse but I have definitely seen better, and YOU deserve better!

Eagle vs. Shark?

It's more like the old quip, ""What's the difference between ignorance and apathy?""

Answer:  ""I don't know and I don't care.""

Which pretty much sums up my feeling toward ""Eagle Versus Shark.""",1201392000,2,1368,4.626556016597511

Eagle vs Shark doesn't follow the traditional narrative beats and instead follows its own unique rhythm. Director Taika Waititi gives his film all kinds of personal touches that separate it from other motion pictures. It helps that the film is set in a specific locale with actors who don't try to mask their accents and this adds to the motion picture's exotic appeal. Eagle vs Shark has a hand-made feel and employs old school stop-motion animation in a way that evokes the work of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Director-s-Series-Vol-3-The-Work-of-Director-Michel-Gondry/dp/B0000DBJ9J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Director's Series, Vol. 3 - The Work of Director Michel Gondry</a>. It is one of the many joys of watching a film so obviously made outside of the studio system with no perfect looking movie stars.

There is a collection of deleted scenes with an optional commentary by writer/director Taika Waititi. A lot of this footage showcases more of Jarrod's relationship with his family. There is also more of Jarrod getting ready for his showdown with a bully. We also see more of Lily interacting with Jarrod's family.

Also included is an ""Outtakes"" reel featuring the cast blowing their lines as they crack each other up.

The music video for ""Going Fishing"" by the Phoenix Foundation is a catchy indie song featuring lots of clips from the film.

Finally, there is an audio commentary by Waititi. Early on he gets Loren Horsley on the phone and they talk about an alternate opening credits animation that they ultimately rejected. They also point out all of their friends that populate the backgrounds of various scenes. Waititi recounts several filming anecdotes, delivering a very personable commentary for a very personal film.",1201046400,5,2515,6.87460815047022
2998199,5,B000X418V8,"Lilly (Loren Horsley) works in a fast food restaurant and garners the respect of no one. But she takes it on the chin and remains curiously sweet. She's got a crush on Jarrod, a narcissist geek with a horrible mullet played by Jemaine Clement of Flight of the Conchords fame. Jarrod and Lilly hook up at a party one night. (Do you want to have sex? OK.) Jarrod has a mission-to crush a samoan lad who tortured him in school. He returns home to fight his nemesis. I won't give it away, but the ending to this movie had me laughing hysterically.  This is a completely original script absent banal comedy and full of emotional depth. You won't see films like this coming out of Hollywood these days. Thank you Taika and the NZ Film Commission.

Many people have compared Eagle to Napoleon Dynamite, but I find the comparison lacking. Yes, Lily and Jarrod are geeks, but the similarities with Napoleon end there. This isn't a geek revenge movie though the plot may seem like that on the face of it. The movie is titled Eagle vs. Shark but it could be titled man vs. woman. Neither Lily or Jarrod run to each other as solace from the outside world. Lily has a warm home life with her brother and Jarrod is pretty solidly convinced of his stature and his ability with women until the end of the movie. It's interesting to see how Lily turns Jarod around. This film is about the balance of power between Lily and Jarod, not geeks vs the world.

There are a lot of good minor characters in this film including Jarrod's sister and her husband and Lily's brother. Jarrod's daughter is played brilliantly by an eccentric little girl whose name I can't find on the DVD. She's cute to watch. I liked Lorena's performance. She brings strength to her role as Lily but doesn't come off aggressive. It must have been a difficult role to play right.

Good extras on the film including some nice deleted scenes. The commentary with Taika was a little off putting. He seems a bit over it. His girlfriend, Lorena Horsely who plays Lily calls from NZ and they talk a bit about the film, but neither one of them seem very into it. It seems like the commentary was added a long long time after the film was made and maybe thrown in because of the success of Conchords. The most interesting commentary comes from the guy that plays Jarrod's brother in law. Taika says things like ""that scene comes from the Sundance film workshop"" but doesn't explain what that is or why he was there. Flight of the Conchords fans don't buy Eagle to hear any interviews or commentary with Jemaine. He is curiously absent from all the extras here as he was with Conchords. Jemaine seems more over it all these days than anyone. I doubt HBO will get a season 3 out of him unless they throw him mad mad money.

There are a lot of great views of NZ in this film. Loved the camera shot on the playground with Lily running in the mouse wheel with the bay out the back. Gorgeous.  Good music from the Phoenix Foundation&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horsepower/dp/B000MM1FU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horsepower</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pegasus/dp/B000KLQD0U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pegasus</a>&nbsp;that works well with the film. The soundtrack wasn't chosen for marketing purposes, it actually works with what's going on in the film.

When I see a good film like this, completed for under a million dollars, you wonder what is going on in Hollywood these days that more films like this aren't made.  Hollywood is good at throwing money into a lot of dumb scripts with hot actors, but it takes someone like Taika to come along and demonstrate how a good movie is really about a good script, not special effects and pretty people.",1200096000,17,3779,4.829984544049459
2998200,5,B000X418V8,"Being a torturously huge fan of Flight of the Conchords, and Jemaine Clement, I looked forward to this film with a jubilant anticipation I haven't felt since high school. Since my love is full-on, I didn't give much thought to the actual content of Eagle vs. Shark before sitting down to view it. I was deeply surprised at the emotional depth of the story and the pronounced portrayal of the characters. Lily's yearning angst and Jarrod's tenderly obnoxious pain was palatable. I still feel the lump of wax in my chest (perhaps Jarrod, using his noble skills, could create a candle with it!). The hilarity here is fulfilling, as well. Taika Waititi doesn't take you on the predictable path of the lonely losers attempting to find solace in their absurd-yet-natural, brutal world. These twists and unexpected subtleties bring out some eye-bugging, ankle-hugging laughter. This film can hold it's own in any venue, with men and women, chicks and dudes, whether or not you've any knowledge of Clement's other pursuits. If you've ever been wronged, if you've ever felt like an outsider, if you've ever cried out, silently, for attention, you'll be able to identify with this story. If not, and you've lived a glorious life, check it out anyway. You'll love it, if only for the stop-action animation and the be-atching soundtrack.

2998201,4,B000X418V8,"This is a sweet little movie starring JEMAINE CLEMENT (of Flight of the Conchords fame) and LOREN HORSLEY (of...being Taika Waititi's girlfriend fame?). Not sure why Amazon doesn't have them listed anywhere as the stars...

The film follows Jarrod (Clement) and Lily's (Horsley) budding romance, from her crush on him as she works at a fast food restaurant he frequents, to their hook-up at a dress-as-your-favorite animal party, to visiting his hometown as he takes revenge on someone who bullied him in  school. They are unlikely soul mates, bonded by similar facial moles.

The film includes beautiful shots of the New Zealand coast, a little stop-action animation, and Clement sporting a really choice mullet! Like a lot of stuff that has been coming out of New Zealand lately, it is heavy on the quirk but also has some funny and heartfelt moments. And fans of Clement will enjoy a scene in which he is wearing a Speedo.

Her love interest is basically Napoleon Dynamite, it's true, but the movie has a lot more to offer.

The story is about a girl (Lily)who lives with her brother and who has a crush on a guy(Jarrod) that comes into the fast food restaurant where she work around 12 o clock everyday. He's not really interested in her and likes another girl who also works there. When Jarrod invites her co worker to a party and she rejects the invitation, Lily takes the opportunity to get to know Jarrod better and then it takes off from there. It's a really cute movie and laughed out loud several times. I liked the pace of the movie and there are some really beautiful scenery shots throughout. There's no nudity that I can remember (except when Lily is running off in the woods and takes her shirt off, but you can't see anything),and maybe a couple of short scenes that may me inappropriate for young viewers.

2998242,5,B000X418V8,"This has become one of my favorite movies!  Several reviewers have compared it to Napoleon Dynamite, and while there is a similar style of humor, this film stands on its own.  The situations are at times exaggerated, but are very honest and true to life.
Lily, a mousy fast food worker, doesn't get any respect from her coworkers and tries way too hard to get Jared's attention when he comes in.  Jared is overcompensating for his need for dad's approval by turning the machismo on blast.
The story takes us back to Jared's hometown, where he and Lily (the best female Fight Man player he's ever met) are driven by her brother (a remarkable celebrity impressionist- NOT) and dropped off so Jared can get revenge on the Samoan who made his life hell.  We meet Jared's pal (the best computer hacker he's ever met!  On a dial-up 1980's apple!), and his family who don't think highly of him.  The early banter between Jared and his sister is classic!  Details unfold shedding light on Jared's family background, and as Lily builds a bond with them it drives Jared to try harder to impress them and further from Lily.  Things build as Jared invites his rival to attend a fight, and after being verbally berated and annoyed, the Samoan accepts.  Life lessons are learned, bonds restored, etc., I won't give away the plotlines or ending!  It was very funny and enjoyable through and through!  I've seen Jermaine Clement in a couple of films now, and he's always hilarious.  This has to be my favorite, mainly because it's just a slight exaggeration of real people and real life.  The truth is always funny!
Blu-ray has great picture and sound, there are some decent indie songs on the soundtrack as well (the best one from Zane's band- but the dance moves really make it cool!).  It costs quite a bit more, but it's region free and can be played in the States.",1372204800,4,1853,4.609756097560975

2998246,4,B000X418V8,"This is an Indy flick to the nines. Micro budget. Small cast. No frou frou. Just a nifty script and the right people pulling the right levers.

Here's the scoop. Lily works at a franchise burger joint in a mall. Across from her, at a movie store, works Jarrod. Both are major dweebs. He has serious issues with self esteem and she's not far behind, but she's warm for his form. She gets sacked and, through a minor fluke, ends up at a party he's throwing. Now she's in his radar. She travels with him to his family's home where he figures to settle an age old score with a bully. Revelations abound.

Yup. Underdog nerds wallpaper the entire film. You've never witnessed such a huge number of misfits at one time in your entire life. These folk have not a clue. This is a short putt from ""Napoleon Dynamite"" in both content and form, but I didn't care. These people are a stitch. Watching Jarrod train for his major bout, or watching his sister and brother in law try to sell unsellable stuff, has to be seen to be believed. And Jarrod's young daughter must be in line for a nerd-cutie award. She's a doll who adds that little something to the proceedings. Other than Lily seeing Jarrod's dark side, and wondering if she can maintain a lifelong relationship with him, there really isn't a story or character arc here. But to see these people search for their place in the world is satisfying.

Loren Horsley as Lily (who also helped write the script) seems quite lovely, but did a great job dumbing herself down. Jermaine Clement plays Jarrod and, likewise, does a good job. All the second tier actors are well worth the price of admission. This is simply fun, Indy fare.

Jemaine Clement never really disappoints in my opinion and his general grossness throughout the film (because there's really no other way to describe it) ends up being oddly endearing. It's all just wacky and strange and definitely one I'll be buying for my movie collection. If you like movies like this... check out Gentleman Broncos which is in the same thread. In an age where we seem to be inundated with action and horror movies or even the trademark romantic comedy it's so refreshing to see a film that takes you in a completely different direction.,1347148800,,721,4.869918699186992
2998255,4,B000X418V8,"I'm even now, a week after screening the film, still trying to process it.

This has the look and feel of a very low budget independent. But despite the simple stages and unfinished facade, I can discern a much more polished and sophisticated hand in the craftsmanship. The depth of story presented in this movie is difficult to categorize. And that particular kind of difficulty, to me, speaks of a visionary talent.

Tells the tale of two very offbeat people and their circle of equally odd family and friends. Although these characters seem much more than the usual motley group of shy wallflowers and social outcasts. My understanding of high-functioning autistics is limited - but many of the characters, especially the principals, seem to exhibit behaviors that I associate with such individuals.

Lily is a wonderfully sweet and unassuming young woman who works the counter at a burger joint. A pariah among her fellow workers, she's constantly dismissed, disrespected and generally treated very poorly. Her only perk - the daily lunch visit by a video sales clerk in a neighboring business. He's the male Yin to her Yang. Not just emotionally, but physically, as she feels connected by virtue of a shared facial beauty mark. She's obviously smitten, but the object of her affection is unaware; completely oblivious to the signals being sent. We soon find out why.

The bespectacled video store employee is Jarrod, a strange young man who only makes intermitent eye contact and communicates in terse, brittle statements of fact. No inflection, pitch or verse - just a monotone drone of transmitted information. Unless he's upset, which is often. And importantly, doesn't seem to appreciate the rather intense amorous attention being pointed in his direction.

Sadly, Lily's odd behavior and inability to socialize with her fellow co-workers has created tension perceived too difficult to manage, and a staged bogus reduction-in-force is enacted; essentially firing her under a false pretext. But this cowardly act is actually a blessing in disguise, freeing her to take action on her feelings. She picks up a tossed invitation from the garbage, originally intended for a co-worker, to a costume party being thrown by Jarrod and his friends. So begins the tale of The Eagle and The Shark, as Lily discovers that her new beau is a man on a very unusual, almost quixotic, mission.

These two misfits somehow, almost magically, manage to find one another along the rough back roads of life. In exploring this fascinating mating dance, the cast reveals a completely oblique love story that's both tender and uncomfortable.

Very reminiscent of the documentary '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crumb/dp/B000ELL1RG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crumb</a>', though thankfully benign and less tragic.

Movie Note:

- What I mean by visionary: The intensely subtle nuance crafted by Director Taika Waititi. If you look closely at Jarrod's bedroom, every single item is a powerful description of just who and what he is. The obsessive/compulsive need to outline tools on a work board, fastidiously detailed model airplanes, superhero figurines, crude drawings of himself as a 'man/bear' and warrior, mounted martial arts weapons on the wall, and a puma lion drawing over his bedboard - taken collectively scream volumes that he's only an adult by virtue of chronological date, a boy in a man's body. Yet that scene is less than 30 seconds of the film; you actually have to freeze-frame it in order to grasp the amazing attention to detail.

And later, we learn that his creativity is born less from a desire for personal expression and more a reflection of his jealousy - a dead older brother that had accomplished all the feats that he cannot quite grasp. Where Jarrod puts up martial art posters and hangs asian weapons on the wall - his brother earned a black belt in karate. Sketches that Jarrod attempts are a pale reflection of his late brother's ability to paint. And so on.

It's a profound moment when Lily enters both bedrooms and grasps the source of Jarrod's conflicted passions and sense of impotence.

Again, to me, speaks volumes of a sublime filmmaker and his craft.",1339200000,,4213,5.161290322580645

Both have geeky, anti-social leads, but Eagle Vs. Shark is about a real family, real problems, real life.

There's also this darling little girl Vinny (played by Morag Hills), who says very little, but given her situation, your heart just goes out to her.

2998260,3,B000X418V8,"I enjoyed this movie, and if I could, I would given it a 3.5 star review.

However, many people dislike this movie, and this may be why.

This movie is less a comedy, as it is sometimes marketed, and more of a character driven 'dromedy.' People need to be able to relate to the characters in the movie if a character driven plot is going to work. The problem is that these characters, for the most part, are not very identifiable.

Also, people like to see growth in the main characters. They like to see a flaw, a realization, growth, and flaw overcome. After watching the movie, I question what, if anthing, did these characters learn and grow from.

That being said. None of that matters to me. This film stepped out of the old movie formulas, and into more of a real life feel, although it is still ultimately unrealistic. However, some people in this world are as disturbed as Clement's character, and not everyone learns the lesson that is presented to them.

I think a good test for a movie is if you feel strongly about the plight of the hero or heroine, and in this movie, I want so badly for Lily to be happy.

I enjoyed the stop-motion side story. I won't ruin the movie for you, but there is a strong, somewhat obvious metaphor presented in those very creative scenes. Also, I thought the soundtrack added depth to this movie, which cannot be said of most soundtracks.",1257465600,3,1380,4.4563492063492065

2998267,1,B000X418V8,"This film is a major disappointment. Major. I am a huge fan of Flight of the Conchords, which is witty, clever, beautifully photographed, well acted, and wildly funny. This is none of those things. The main characters are not very interesting at best, or, in the case of Jarrod, massively irritating. A selfish jerk, a self-absorbed fool, an inarticulate bore, an utterly un-self aware misogynist, and a lying, grubby phony, he offers not one reason to care about him. Tossing aside everyone and everything, he is a one-man wrecking crew, destroying and punishing all around him. For a man so desperate for his father's approval, you would think he would offer some fathering to his daughter, but no, he never cares about her in any way. Jarrod is a miserable jerk, the kind of person you'd run from in a heartbeat. I was repelled by every aspect of him.

No need to go on at length. I cannot imagine how this got the accolades it did. If you enjoy laughing at the downtrodden and lonely, if you think the incompetent and confused are worthy subjects of your supercilious derision, if sad people make you chuckle, then this film may be for you. If you feel any empathy for the lost and lonely Lily, you will sit open mouthed as she is subject to endless humiliation, only to find herself while wildly drunk.

This film is a bit sad - not in the ""tragic"" sense - but in the ""people  have difficulties"" sense. Which does not diminish its charm.

The heroine, Lily, is adorable, lovable and memorable; the picture of forgiveness and patience. I particularly loved the relationship between she and Damon, her brother.

Jarrod, the other main character,  is a bit funny and more than a bit weird, which is where the quirk comes in.

Part of the charm is the ""not in America"" feel of the film.  You know, where the characters are the main focus, plot is something to work on and the snapshots of another country.

Jarrod is a doof and resembles an angrier, oafish, Napoleon Dynamite.

The differences between the two characters are age, nationality...New Zealand and a revengeful spirit.

Jarrod is a complex character (unlike the flat Dynamite). He lives in the shadow of his dead brother-- whose ribbons, trophies and awards festoon his father's home (a little reminder to Jarrod of the man he can never become). His desperation to please his stoic father leads him to hurtful decisions. Frequently, the viewer is alienated from Jarrod, disdaining his selfish cruelty. Still, director/writer Taika Cohen allows Jarrod great sympathy. The viewer hopes for a transformation ... if only for Lily's sake.

Loren Horsley's character, Lily, shares a quiet life with her brother. The relationship is sweet and nurturing ... unlike Jarrod's relationship with his family which revolves around vulgar name-calling (underscoring the arrested development of the family). Lily is opened hearted, but not a fool ... as Jarrod will soon learn.

The film's mise en scene is gorgeous ... the opening sequence (alone) stole my breath. I very much enjoyed the playfulness of the cinematography ... I wish we would see more this risk-taking in American film. Furthermore, the stop-motion animation is initially jarring, but becomes crucial to the over-all message. Surprisingly cute and oddly compelling.

Yes, some elements of this work are predictable, but that's true of most films. And entirely forgivable.

If you're into swishy jogging suits and off-beat romance, give this film a chance. But, a note of caution, rent this work before buying it. (It's quirkiness will not appeal to all).",1206403200,6,2649,6.966867469879518

I loved the relationship between Lily and her brother Damon, which was the complete opposite of how Jarrod and his verbally abusive sister treat each other. Lily returns with Jarrod on a visit to his hometown to help him bring closure to a couple past events haunting Jarrod; a bully and the death of Jarrod's older brother. The fight scene between Jarrod and the bully was completely unexpected, but I loved the writer's 'shock treatment' on his audience. When Jarrod finally realizes that Lily is perfect for him it is a wonderful moment. We also get the sense that he's come to terms with his struggle to please his dad and the futile attempts to get out of his big brother's haunting shadow. A sort of 'coming-of-age' story in the adult years, mixed with a bit of a bizarre love story. Excellent!

The story of gawky Lilly and misfit Jarrod is not enough to pull along this thin tale. If you find ""Flight of the Conchords"" funny, you may enjoy this movie. If you don't get it, the film may not appear to you. The dude from Conchords is just flat-out . . . not funny. Delivering his lines in a flat monotone, he conveys the emotional range of an Intel microprocessor.

The New Zealand accents are so thick that, at time, American viewers would appreciate English subtitles (which I later learned are actually available with the DVD - consider activating).  I don't think I laughed (or even chuckled) once the whole 90 minutes. The scenes of Jarrod training for his upcoming confrontation are pathetic - more like a gay Rocky...  The notion that this guy would fight his way out of a paper bag is ludicrous.  He is as intimidating as a poodle with a spiked collar, or Barry Manilow brandishing a man-purse.  I could have done without the scene where the hapless Jarrod beats a wheelchair-bound rival - a fat Samoan -- with nunchuk sticks.

Eagle vs Shark doesn't follow the traditional narrative beats and instead follows its own unique rhythm. Director Taika Waititi gives his film all kinds of personal touches that separate it from other motion pictures. It helps that the film is set in a specific locale with actors who don't try to mask their accents and this adds to the motion picture's exotic appeal. Eagle vs Shark has a hand-made feel and employs old school stop-motion animation in a way that evokes the work of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Director-s-Series-Vol-3-The-Work-of-Director-Michel-Gondry/dp/B0000DBJ9J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Director's Series, Vol. 3 - The Work of Director Michel Gondry</a>. It is one of the many joys of watching a film so obviously made outside of the studio system with no perfect looking movie stars.

There is a collection of deleted scenes with an optional commentary by writer/director Taika Waititi. A lot of this footage showcases more of Jarrod's relationship with his family. There is also more of Jarrod getting ready for his showdown with a bully. We also see more of Lily interacting with Jarrod's family.

Also included is an ""Outtakes"" reel featuring the cast blowing their lines as they crack each other up.

The music video for ""Going Fishing"" by the Phoenix Foundation is a catchy indie song featuring lots of clips from the film.

Finally, there is an audio commentary by Waititi. Early on he gets Loren Horsley on the phone and they talk about an alternate opening credits animation that they ultimately rejected. They also point out all of their friends that populate the backgrounds of various scenes. Waititi recounts several filming anecdotes, delivering a very personable commentary for a very personal film.",1201046400,5,2515,6.87460815047022
3232696,5,B000X418V8,"Lilly (Loren Horsley) works in a fast food restaurant and garners the respect of no one. But she takes it on the chin and remains curiously sweet. She's got a crush on Jarrod, a narcissist geek with a horrible mullet played by Jemaine Clement of Flight of the Conchords fame. Jarrod and Lilly hook up at a party one night. (Do you want to have sex? OK.) Jarrod has a mission-to crush a samoan lad who tortured him in school. He returns home to fight his nemesis. I won't give it away, but the ending to this movie had me laughing hysterically.  This is a completely original script absent banal comedy and full of emotional depth. You won't see films like this coming out of Hollywood these days. Thank you Taika and the NZ Film Commission.

Many people have compared Eagle to Napoleon Dynamite, but I find the comparison lacking. Yes, Lily and Jarrod are geeks, but the similarities with Napoleon end there. This isn't a geek revenge movie though the plot may seem like that on the face of it. The movie is titled Eagle vs. Shark but it could be titled man vs. woman. Neither Lily or Jarrod run to each other as solace from the outside world. Lily has a warm home life with her brother and Jarrod is pretty solidly convinced of his stature and his ability with women until the end of the movie. It's interesting to see how Lily turns Jarod around. This film is about the balance of power between Lily and Jarod, not geeks vs the world.

There are a lot of good minor characters in this film including Jarrod's sister and her husband and Lily's brother. Jarrod's daughter is played brilliantly by an eccentric little girl whose name I can't find on the DVD. She's cute to watch. I liked Lorena's performance. She brings strength to her role as Lily but doesn't come off aggressive. It must have been a difficult role to play right.

Good extras on the film including some nice deleted scenes. The commentary with Taika was a little off putting. He seems a bit over it. His girlfriend, Lorena Horsely who plays Lily calls from NZ and they talk a bit about the film, but neither one of them seem very into it. It seems like the commentary was added a long long time after the film was made and maybe thrown in because of the success of Conchords. The most interesting commentary comes from the guy that plays Jarrod's brother in law. Taika says things like ""that scene comes from the Sundance film workshop"" but doesn't explain what that is or why he was there. Flight of the Conchords fans don't buy Eagle to hear any interviews or commentary with Jemaine. He is curiously absent from all the extras here as he was with Conchords. Jemaine seems more over it all these days than anyone. I doubt HBO will get a season 3 out of him unless they throw him mad mad money.

There are a lot of great views of NZ in this film. Loved the camera shot on the playground with Lily running in the mouse wheel with the bay out the back. Gorgeous.  Good music from the Phoenix Foundation&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horsepower/dp/B000MM1FU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horsepower</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pegasus/dp/B000KLQD0U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pegasus</a>&nbsp;that works well with the film. The soundtrack wasn't chosen for marketing purposes, it actually works with what's going on in the film.

When I see a good film like this, completed for under a million dollars, you wonder what is going on in Hollywood these days that more films like this aren't made.  Hollywood is good at throwing money into a lot of dumb scripts with hot actors, but it takes someone like Taika to come along and demonstrate how a good movie is really about a good script, not special effects and pretty people.",1200096000,17,3779,4.829984544049459
3232697,5,B000X418V8,"Being a torturously huge fan of Flight of the Conchords, and Jemaine Clement, I looked forward to this film with a jubilant anticipation I haven't felt since high school. Since my love is full-on, I didn't give much thought to the actual content of Eagle vs. Shark before sitting down to view it. I was deeply surprised at the emotional depth of the story and the pronounced portrayal of the characters. Lily's yearning angst and Jarrod's tenderly obnoxious pain was palatable. I still feel the lump of wax in my chest (perhaps Jarrod, using his noble skills, could create a candle with it!). The hilarity here is fulfilling, as well. Taika Waititi doesn't take you on the predictable path of the lonely losers attempting to find solace in their absurd-yet-natural, brutal world. These twists and unexpected subtleties bring out some eye-bugging, ankle-hugging laughter. This film can hold it's own in any venue, with men and women, chicks and dudes, whether or not you've any knowledge of Clement's other pursuits. If you've ever been wronged, if you've ever felt like an outsider, if you've ever cried out, silently, for attention, you'll be able to identify with this story. If not, and you've lived a glorious life, check it out anyway. You'll love it, if only for the stop-action animation and the be-atching soundtrack.

The film follows Jarrod (Clement) and Lily's (Horsley) budding romance, from her crush on him as she works at a fast food restaurant he frequents, to their hook-up at a dress-as-your-favorite animal party, to visiting his hometown as he takes revenge on someone who bullied him in  school. They are unlikely soul mates, bonded by similar facial moles.

The film includes beautiful shots of the New Zealand coast, a little stop-action animation, and Clement sporting a really choice mullet! Like a lot of stuff that has been coming out of New Zealand lately, it is heavy on the quirk but also has some funny and heartfelt moments. And fans of Clement will enjoy a scene in which he is wearing a Speedo.

The story is about a girl (Lily)who lives with her brother and who has a crush on a guy(Jarrod) that comes into the fast food restaurant where she work around 12 o clock everyday. He's not really interested in her and likes another girl who also works there. When Jarrod invites her co worker to a party and she rejects the invitation, Lily takes the opportunity to get to know Jarrod better and then it takes off from there. It's a really cute movie and laughed out loud several times. I liked the pace of the movie and there are some really beautiful scenery shots throughout. There's no nudity that I can remember (except when Lily is running off in the woods and takes her shirt off, but you can't see anything),and maybe a couple of short scenes that may me inappropriate for young viewers.

Lily, a mousy fast food worker, doesn't get any respect from her coworkers and tries way too hard to get Jared's attention when he comes in.  Jared is overcompensating for his need for dad's approval by turning the machismo on blast.
The story takes us back to Jared's hometown, where he and Lily (the best female Fight Man player he's ever met) are driven by her brother (a remarkable celebrity impressionist- NOT) and dropped off so Jared can get revenge on the Samoan who made his life hell.  We meet Jared's pal (the best computer hacker he's ever met!  On a dial-up 1980's apple!), and his family who don't think highly of him.  The early banter between Jared and his sister is classic!  Details unfold shedding light on Jared's family background, and as Lily builds a bond with them it drives Jared to try harder to impress them and further from Lily.  Things build as Jared invites his rival to attend a fight, and after being verbally berated and annoyed, the Samoan accepts.  Life lessons are learned, bonds restored, etc., I won't give away the plotlines or ending!  It was very funny and enjoyable through and through!  I've seen Jermaine Clement in a couple of films now, and he's always hilarious.  This has to be my favorite, mainly because it's just a slight exaggeration of real people and real life.  The truth is always funny!
Blu-ray has great picture and sound, there are some decent indie songs on the soundtrack as well (the best one from Zane's band- but the dance moves really make it cool!).  It costs quite a bit more, but it's region free and can be played in the States.",1372204800,4,1853,4.609756097560975

3232743,4,B000X418V8,"This is an Indy flick to the nines. Micro budget. Small cast. No frou frou. Just a nifty script and the right people pulling the right levers.

Here's the scoop. Lily works at a franchise burger joint in a mall. Across from her, at a movie store, works Jarrod. Both are major dweebs. He has serious issues with self esteem and she's not far behind, but she's warm for his form. She gets sacked and, through a minor fluke, ends up at a party he's throwing. Now she's in his radar. She travels with him to his family's home where he figures to settle an age old score with a bully. Revelations abound.

Yup. Underdog nerds wallpaper the entire film. You've never witnessed such a huge number of misfits at one time in your entire life. These folk have not a clue. This is a short putt from ""Napoleon Dynamite"" in both content and form, but I didn't care. These people are a stitch. Watching Jarrod train for his major bout, or watching his sister and brother in law try to sell unsellable stuff, has to be seen to be believed. And Jarrod's young daughter must be in line for a nerd-cutie award. She's a doll who adds that little something to the proceedings. Other than Lily seeing Jarrod's dark side, and wondering if she can maintain a lifelong relationship with him, there really isn't a story or character arc here. But to see these people search for their place in the world is satisfying.

Loren Horsley as Lily (who also helped write the script) seems quite lovely, but did a great job dumbing herself down. Jermaine Clement plays Jarrod and, likewise, does a good job. All the second tier actors are well worth the price of admission. This is simply fun, Indy fare.

3232751,5,B000X418V8,I absolutely adored this film! It's the story of two totally awkward and unconventional personalities falling in love and trying to figure out how that even works. Jemaine Clement never really disappoints in my opinion and his general grossness throughout the film (because there's really no other way to describe it) ends up being oddly endearing. It's all just wacky and strange and definitely one I'll be buying for my movie collection. If you like movies like this... check out Gentleman Broncos which is in the same thread. In an age where we seem to be inundated with action and horror movies or even the trademark romantic comedy it's so refreshing to see a film that takes you in a completely different direction.,1347148800,,721,4.869918699186992
3232752,4,B000X418V8,"I'm even now, a week after screening the film, still trying to process it.

This has the look and feel of a very low budget independent. But despite the simple stages and unfinished facade, I can discern a much more polished and sophisticated hand in the craftsmanship. The depth of story presented in this movie is difficult to categorize. And that particular kind of difficulty, to me, speaks of a visionary talent.

Tells the tale of two very offbeat people and their circle of equally odd family and friends. Although these characters seem much more than the usual motley group of shy wallflowers and social outcasts. My understanding of high-functioning autistics is limited - but many of the characters, especially the principals, seem to exhibit behaviors that I associate with such individuals.

Lily is a wonderfully sweet and unassuming young woman who works the counter at a burger joint. A pariah among her fellow workers, she's constantly dismissed, disrespected and generally treated very poorly. Her only perk - the daily lunch visit by a video sales clerk in a neighboring business. He's the male Yin to her Yang. Not just emotionally, but physically, as she feels connected by virtue of a shared facial beauty mark. She's obviously smitten, but the object of her affection is unaware; completely oblivious to the signals being sent. We soon find out why.

The bespectacled video store employee is Jarrod, a strange young man who only makes intermitent eye contact and communicates in terse, brittle statements of fact. No inflection, pitch or verse - just a monotone drone of transmitted information. Unless he's upset, which is often. And importantly, doesn't seem to appreciate the rather intense amorous attention being pointed in his direction.

Sadly, Lily's odd behavior and inability to socialize with her fellow co-workers has created tension perceived too difficult to manage, and a staged bogus reduction-in-force is enacted; essentially firing her under a false pretext. But this cowardly act is actually a blessing in disguise, freeing her to take action on her feelings. She picks up a tossed invitation from the garbage, originally intended for a co-worker, to a costume party being thrown by Jarrod and his friends. So begins the tale of The Eagle and The Shark, as Lily discovers that her new beau is a man on a very unusual, almost quixotic, mission.

These two misfits somehow, almost magically, manage to find one another along the rough back roads of life. In exploring this fascinating mating dance, the cast reveals a completely oblique love story that's both tender and uncomfortable.

Very reminiscent of the documentary '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crumb/dp/B000ELL1RG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crumb</a>', though thankfully benign and less tragic.

Movie Note:

- What I mean by visionary: The intensely subtle nuance crafted by Director Taika Waititi. If you look closely at Jarrod's bedroom, every single item is a powerful description of just who and what he is. The obsessive/compulsive need to outline tools on a work board, fastidiously detailed model airplanes, superhero figurines, crude drawings of himself as a 'man/bear' and warrior, mounted martial arts weapons on the wall, and a puma lion drawing over his bedboard - taken collectively scream volumes that he's only an adult by virtue of chronological date, a boy in a man's body. Yet that scene is less than 30 seconds of the film; you actually have to freeze-frame it in order to grasp the amazing attention to detail.

And later, we learn that his creativity is born less from a desire for personal expression and more a reflection of his jealousy - a dead older brother that had accomplished all the feats that he cannot quite grasp. Where Jarrod puts up martial art posters and hangs asian weapons on the wall - his brother earned a black belt in karate. Sketches that Jarrod attempts are a pale reflection of his late brother's ability to paint. And so on.

It's a profound moment when Lily enters both bedrooms and grasps the source of Jarrod's conflicted passions and sense of impotence.

Again, to me, speaks volumes of a sublime filmmaker and his craft.",1339200000,,4213,5.161290322580645

Both have geeky, anti-social leads, but Eagle Vs. Shark is about a real family, real problems, real life.

What I love about this film, are the funny bits that keep us from going crazy, in between all the tough bits.

There's also this darling little girl Vinny (played by Morag Hills), who says very little, but given her situation, your heart just goes out to her.

3232757,3,B000X418V8,"I enjoyed this movie, and if I could, I would given it a 3.5 star review.

However, many people dislike this movie, and this may be why.

This movie is less a comedy, as it is sometimes marketed, and more of a character driven 'dromedy.' People need to be able to relate to the characters in the movie if a character driven plot is going to work. The problem is that these characters, for the most part, are not very identifiable.

Also, people like to see growth in the main characters. They like to see a flaw, a realization, growth, and flaw overcome. After watching the movie, I question what, if anthing, did these characters learn and grow from.

That being said. None of that matters to me. This film stepped out of the old movie formulas, and into more of a real life feel, although it is still ultimately unrealistic. However, some people in this world are as disturbed as Clement's character, and not everyone learns the lesson that is presented to them.

I think a good test for a movie is if you feel strongly about the plight of the hero or heroine, and in this movie, I want so badly for Lily to be happy.

I enjoyed the stop-motion side story. I won't ruin the movie for you, but there is a strong, somewhat obvious metaphor presented in those very creative scenes. Also, I thought the soundtrack added depth to this movie, which cannot be said of most soundtracks.",1257465600,3,1380,4.4563492063492065

The father was a pretend disabled wierdo who treated his living son like crap. And Jarod, OMG, I LOVE LOVE LOVE Jemaine Clement, he is so super hot, but what a dick in this movie.

3232764,1,B000X418V8,"This film is a major disappointment. Major. I am a huge fan of Flight of the Conchords, which is witty, clever, beautifully photographed, well acted, and wildly funny. This is none of those things. The main characters are not very interesting at best, or, in the case of Jarrod, massively irritating. A selfish jerk, a self-absorbed fool, an inarticulate bore, an utterly un-self aware misogynist, and a lying, grubby phony, he offers not one reason to care about him. Tossing aside everyone and everything, he is a one-man wrecking crew, destroying and punishing all around him. For a man so desperate for his father's approval, you would think he would offer some fathering to his daughter, but no, he never cares about her in any way. Jarrod is a miserable jerk, the kind of person you'd run from in a heartbeat. I was repelled by every aspect of him.

No need to go on at length. I cannot imagine how this got the accolades it did. If you enjoy laughing at the downtrodden and lonely, if you think the incompetent and confused are worthy subjects of your supercilious derision, if sad people make you chuckle, then this film may be for you. If you feel any empathy for the lost and lonely Lily, you will sit open mouthed as she is subject to endless humiliation, only to find herself while wildly drunk.

3232767,5,B000X418V8,"Charming Quirkiness , is what comes to mind for me when I think of this movie; I loved it and fell in love with the characters right away.

This film is a bit sad - not in the ""tragic"" sense - but in the ""people  have difficulties"" sense. Which does not diminish its charm.

The heroine, Lily, is adorable, lovable and memorable; the picture of forgiveness and patience. I particularly loved the relationship between she and Damon, her brother.

Jarrod, the other main character,  is a bit funny and more than a bit weird, which is where the quirk comes in.

Part of the charm is the ""not in America"" feel of the film.  You know, where the characters are the main focus, plot is something to work on and the snapshots of another country.

Jarrod is a doof and resembles an angrier, oafish, Napoleon Dynamite.

The differences between the two characters are age, nationality...New Zealand and a revengeful spirit.

Jarrod is a complex character (unlike the flat Dynamite). He lives in the shadow of his dead brother-- whose ribbons, trophies and awards festoon his father's home (a little reminder to Jarrod of the man he can never become). His desperation to please his stoic father leads him to hurtful decisions. Frequently, the viewer is alienated from Jarrod, disdaining his selfish cruelty. Still, director/writer Taika Cohen allows Jarrod great sympathy. The viewer hopes for a transformation ... if only for Lily's sake.

Loren Horsley's character, Lily, shares a quiet life with her brother. The relationship is sweet and nurturing ... unlike Jarrod's relationship with his family which revolves around vulgar name-calling (underscoring the arrested development of the family). Lily is opened hearted, but not a fool ... as Jarrod will soon learn.

The film's mise en scene is gorgeous ... the opening sequence (alone) stole my breath. I very much enjoyed the playfulness of the cinematography ... I wish we would see more this risk-taking in American film. Furthermore, the stop-motion animation is initially jarring, but becomes crucial to the over-all message. Surprisingly cute and oddly compelling.

Yes, some elements of this work are predictable, but that's true of most films. And entirely forgivable.

If you're into swishy jogging suits and off-beat romance, give this film a chance. But, a note of caution, rent this work before buying it. (It's quirkiness will not appeal to all).",1206403200,6,2649,6.966867469879518

I loved the relationship between Lily and her brother Damon, which was the complete opposite of how Jarrod and his verbally abusive sister treat each other. Lily returns with Jarrod on a visit to his hometown to help him bring closure to a couple past events haunting Jarrod; a bully and the death of Jarrod's older brother. The fight scene between Jarrod and the bully was completely unexpected, but I loved the writer's 'shock treatment' on his audience. When Jarrod finally realizes that Lily is perfect for him it is a wonderful moment. We also get the sense that he's come to terms with his struggle to please his dad and the futile attempts to get out of his big brother's haunting shadow. A sort of 'coming-of-age' story in the adult years, mixed with a bit of a bizarre love story. Excellent!
