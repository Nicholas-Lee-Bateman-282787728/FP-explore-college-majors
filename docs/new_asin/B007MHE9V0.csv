8519524,5,B007MHE9V0,"A difference from the other travel the road series.  These guys get in with Peru and Columbian commandos, fly into drug labs in the middle of jungles, capture the 'pharmacists' and give the gospel to them straight....most of the dvd is of the commandos going through the jungles and burning/blowing up the labs....Awesome stuff.",1391644800,3,328,5.074074074074074
8519525,2,B007MHE9V0,From the dvd description I expected the dvd to be about their adventure into the jungle & changing criminals lives. They showed the guys witnessing to I think two people . It shouldve been combined with other video segments & refocused. I do love their missions though & their hearts.,1350345600,2,284,4.7
