7002967,4,B00T89H3UY,"Henry James' The Turn of the Screw (Penguin Classics) is one of my all-time favorite psychological suspense novels (or supernatural, whichever way you choose to interpret it), and I have watched several adaptations. One of my personal favorites is The Innocents starring Deborah Kerr, and more recently, I watched the disturbing The Nightcomers which is not strictly an adaptation of the source, but more of a prequel to the story, based on a novel written by Michael Hastings, The Nightcomers. There's also a 2000 Masterpiece Theatre presentation starring Jodhi May, Henry James' The Turn of the Screw and a made-for-TV version starring Valerie Bertinelli titled ""The Haunting of Helen Walker"" which is available on Youtube.

In this 2009 BBC dramatization, a pre-Downton Abbey Michelle Dockery plays the unfortunate governess Ann. The setting is London in 1921. A young woman is undergoing psychiatric evaluation, and her psychiatrist is Dr. Fisher, played by Dan Stevens, who coincidentally played Dockery's love interest Matthew Crowley in Downton Abbey. Dr. Fisher is determined to get the real story of what occurred in the days leading up to Ann being admitted to the hospital. At first Ann is uncooperative and almost in a state of catatonia. It is only later that she opens up to Dr. Fisher and recounts the horrors she has been through.

I found this a credible plot twist. I have always been rather curious about what happened to Ann after the events narrated in James' book, and this sort of fills in the gaps. Michelle Dockery is a compelling Ann, and plays her role well from the very beginning. Ann is a young woman of twenty when she applies for and is accepted as governess for Flora (Eva Sayer) and later Miles (Josef Lindsay). Her instructions are clear in that she is not to trouble the children's guardian (their uncle, who is based in London) with any problems she might run across, and is to handle everything on her own. Ann accepts this charge and travels to a remote English manor house somewhere in the English countryside. There she receives a stilted welcome from the formidable housekeeper, Mrs. Grose (Sue Johnston) and a couple of maids.

Ann has an uncanny experience when she goes looking for Flora, and thinks she hears whisperings. Later, Miles gets sent home, expelled from school, but the reasons for his expulsion are not made clear. Ann becomes troubled by the strange occurrences around the house - seeing the face of a man appear at the door; hearing voices, and later seeing what appears to be the figure of a man and a woman observing her and the children.

It is only later that Ann discovers the horrifying truth of what had occurred at the manor some time ago - of a malevolent man named Peter Quint (Edward Macliam) who had forced himself upon the maids working there and who had seduced and indulged in acts of debauchery with the previous governess, Miss Jessel (Katie Lightfoot), of how both Quint and Jessel had died horrible deaths, and of how their spirits are now haunting the manor and its inhabitants.

Ann goes on to narrate what happens when she tries to intervene to save the lives and the very souls of the children from these malevolent forces.

There are some truly chilling moments in this drama, and I felt the ensemble cast did an excellent job in their respective roles. Aside from Dockery's role which is well-played, credit goes to the actor who portrays Miles. He may be a child but the corruption of his character under the guidance of Quint, in both life and death, is chillingly portrayed. Flora is less convincing and the actress who plays her appears a little too wooden in her performance. Dan Stevens only has a secondary role here but plays it well, and when he himself gets drawn into the strange and eerie atmosphere which permeates the film, he shows his revulsion and horror in a credible manner.

I'd recommend this 2009 adaptation to fans of Henry James' novel and also those who like to watch supernatural and/or psychological-themed period dramas.",1432425600,9,4033,4.844702467343977
7002968,3,B00T89H3UY,"While the cast has three Downton Abbey stars Michelle Dockery, Sue Johnson and Dan Stevens in the film, it really doesn't help all that much.  It does not generate any real fear and you still have doubts as to whether it is a ghost story or just a psychological thriller.  Are there ghosts or is she just crazy?  The director did not give a satisfactory feel to the movie and in some places it felt like he was trying to force fear with sound effects.  It wasn't a bad movie and if you are trying to fill time you might give it a watch.  The storyline has a doctor in a mental institution listening to a young governess tell her story or how she ended up there and what led to her being charged with murder.",1431734400,5,707,4.169117647058823
7002969,3,B00T89H3UY,"THIS 2009 ADAPTATION WILL CHALLENGE JAMES PURISTS BUT WILL PERHAPS FIND FANS AS AN INDEPENDENT WORK  ---  (SDH SUBTITLES)

4 TO 5 STARS FOR THE PERFORMANCES AND SETTING
3 STARS JUDGED AS A FILM INDEPENDENT OF JAMES' NOVELLA
1 OR 2 STARS AS AN ADAPTATION

I knew there was some criticism of this production before going in so I decided to watch it as an independent work and look for the many things that might entertain me.  I did enjoy the film, its performances and setting in particular.  The estate that serves as Bly Manor is perfect and absolutely stunning.  It's beautiful and somewhat gothic at the same time.  The filming overall was beautiful as well.  The sound effects were a little overbearing at moments (trying to forcibly injecting fear) and didn't seem quite the quality of other production values in this film.  Of course there are moments of surprise where the sound is supposed to be harsh.  I will keep things mostly positive here and save my real criticism for the adaptation comments below.

THE STORY (no spoilers):  In this version, the tale is set mainly in 1921 rather than mid to late 1800's.  We begin after the horrible incidents at Bly Manor have already occurred.  The governess Ann (Michelle Dockery, Downton Abbey) is now held at an insane asylum in the care of one Dr. Fisher (Dan Stevens, Downton Abbey).  Dr. Fisher is trying to help the clearly distraught and disturbed Ann as they work through the events of the last many months.  We then flash to the beginning as Ann accepts the job as governess and is interviewed by a wealthy playboy in London who needs someone to look after his niece and nephew.  These two children came to be wards of their uncle after their father died in WWI.  Unfortunately, that uncle has little interest in raising the kids.  The uncle is clearly a player, but we see that Ann was affected and even fantasizes that the master will return to Bly and love her.  That aside, Ann goes to Bly and quickly learns that things are strangely amiss.  Only women remain as staff at the manor.  The young girl Flora seems wonderful, but her brother is sent home from boarding school for grievous conduct that is not initially defined.  Soon Ann is also aware of two former employees who appear again on the grounds.  One is her predecessor as governess, Miss Jessel, and the other is the former Valet named Peter Quint.  Ann is told stories of their former debauchery and soon perceives some macabre interest they have in the children.  As the tale progresses, it is an ever widening evil that will question her sanity and force her to decide whether to remain at Bly to protect those she loves, or to flee the horror.

IMPRESSIONS OF THIS ADAPTATION:  As I said before, the period is brought forward by many decades to place it shortly after WWI. This didn't bother me at all, but I am not sure it facilitated much either.  They also add the character of Dr. Fisher which allows them some latitude to explore what was going through Ann's mind during the events.  This device removes some of the subtlety specifically designed by Henry James and serves as a tool to spell out certain details that would otherwise contribute to the mystery.  I am not saying all the ambiguity is gone, just that more is spelled out than the book or other adaptations.  I found that a little patronizing because it presumes that viewers cannot perceive the alternate ramifications on their own.  Because the original tale was mercurial (offering multiple sources for the evil) James himself was hounded about which was outcome was correct. He specifically explained that the mystery was essential to the success of the story so the reader could ponder ramifications of both possibilities (either the ghosts are real - or the ghosts are not real and Ann could be insane).  Though some professional critics have suggested there is still ambiguity in this version, viewers will note that several adult characters all appear separately to accept one viewpoint by the end of the film, suggesting one perspective over the other (the door is still kind of open though as they leave some red herrings).  The film is less subtle on many other levels as well.  Instead of the Turn of the Screw, as its namesake, the story and sound mixing dive right in, trying to immerse the viewer quickly rather than synching the knot, or tightening the screw.  The base nature of Quint is not just alluded to.  It's depicted visually in flashback, including forced sex with some servants and the collusion between him and Miss Jessel.  The implications for the children are also completely spelled out and Miles is even shown viewing the debauchery (remember he is a child).  Other fairly unsavory implications are completely spelled out.  Now, these possibilities were inherent to James' tale also if the reader chooses to imagine.  But the dramatic visual depiction here means this film chooses which implications for the viewer to interpret.  For some viewers, this may remove the sense of macabre in exchange for a certain baseness.

FINAL THOUGHTS:  I know I was harsh in the previous paragraph, but it's important to have the right expectations going into this very different approach.  I still appreciated many aspects of this film, but did not like it as an adaptation.  I did not feel comfortable with the more visual involvement of the children in certain activities.  There is brief nudity of adults having sex with a fleeting implication that a child is invited to watch (cigar and alcohol in hand).  There are different run times listed on web sites, including Amazon, that suggest the US version is longer than the UK.  However, both versions are actually the same at 89 minutes long.  All this said, it's not as graphic as many R movies today.  Tame actually.  I am just saying that it goes much further than most renditions of this specific story and discards James' intentions.  If the sound mixing had been better and the subtlety or mystery preserved more fully, I could easily have given this 4 or 5 stars.  My intent is not necessarily to dissuade viewers.  I just want to prepare and inform so viewers can make their own decision.",1429315200,28,6166,4.753295668549906

7002974,5,B00T89H3UY,"Did you know that these are Matt and Mary from Downton Abbey????? I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them together in this movie at the beginning. It was more than a treat. The movie is essentially Henry James's The Turn of the Screw. The girl that plays  Lady Mary on Downton Abbey plays the governness in this movie. The guy that plays Matthew, is at the beginning. It is very tricky to make a movie out of a story where the mental condition of the main character continues to be debated in literature. Those of us who are hardcore readers and are familiar to this work are not quite sure what to make of it. She did play the part of the partially insane governess to perfection. I think that is the point of view of this director. I enjoyed it a lot.",1456444800,,756,4.213793103448276
7002975,1,B00T89H3UY,"Michelle Docker is a governess who is in an institution. She is confined and considered disturbed by the experience of her work.

Her savior is young, blue eyes himself, our faithful pal, Dan Stevens playing a doctor, counselor or a scientist. He coaxes the story of Michelles work before she is carted off to a more secure facility.

The problem with this story is the source, Henry James. The script is derived from one of his stories and is evidence that Henry James read far too many womens books of the nineteenth century. I know this because in A Jury of her Peers Elaine Showalter explained the formula for many novels written by women during that century: Perfectly reasonable woman finds that life, work and circumstances drive her to the edge. [Note Michelle Dockery has no housecleaning, gardening or cooking to do.] In this case what drives Michelle bonkers are ghosts, or perhaps her imagination, or her undisclosed, unbalanced nature as a woman, of some other absurd cause. Only Henry knows for sure.

But I don't care. It was good to see Dan and Michelle in another production set in the 1920s, but not in this movie.",1454630400,,1132,4.7360406091370555

James is very sinister in his way, and very dark, they used to say he was the ""real psychologist"" and his brother William James  was the one writing fictional material of the bohemian new Age that is still dumbing this country down.  Henry is a harder but more rewarding read and therefore few people read him anymore. It's still a very interesting thriller with a pace that is good.",1447286400,,619,4.508928571428571
