8338541,2,B001RPZE3A,Well that was 90 mins that I won't get back.  It is a predictable story line and the wrinkle at the end is a fizzle in my opinion.,1366243200,,130,3.642857142857143
8338542,5,B001RPZE3A,"When I read the other reviews, especially considering how few there were, I figured it was a fluke.  Like they all came from the director and his family or something.  I took a chance and it paid off!

This was such a good movie!  Funny, clever, very well done.  I'm usually super picky when it comes to technical details and holes in the plot, and even though the scientific details were questionable, they glossed it over in a way that even a professional biologist could accept.  Instead of some movies (*cough Blade cough cough*) who do absolutely no research, spout off a 'scientific' explanation for something, and end up looking like complete idiots.

This film is absolutely recommended!

PS The sidekick Rex totally reminds me of the bastard love child of Bruce Campbell and Jay Leno!  lols  You'll see what I mean!",1357603200,,824,4.73943661971831
8338543,5,B001RPZE3A,"Freezer Burn totally blew me away. I came across it on accident since I was looking for the Crispin Glover, Tom Green flick Freezer Burn: Invasion of Laxdale, but figured since I got it there was no reason not to watch it. I did a quick look up on IMDB to get an idea of the tone of the film, and it seemed sound enough. A man cyrogenically freezes himself so that when he wakes up a young girl he has fallen in love with will be old enough for him to pursue. I didn't read any more so I really had no idea of the tone of the film. What was in my mind was that I was going to sit through a low-budget movie about a pedophile scientist. While the film didn't quite entirely shake that underlining pedophile feeling, it was absolutely much more than my expectations.

Considering it was low budget, and considering the premise, I thought I'd be walking into a film full of tepid, unlikeable characters with jokes that try to hard. I was completely wrong.

Our main character, Virgil, is a man torn between struggling to reach a breakthrough in his experiments while trying to maintain a tenuous relationship with his wife. His lab assistant Rex, the coarse funny man to Virgil's confounded straight man, was great and while his jokes were certainly out there, they were delivered with perfection and never stretched too far to get a laugh. Virgil's wife Blake was a great villain for the first half, although how much of a villain she really is for having a husband who focused more on work and a fourteen year old is up for debate. The object of Virgil's affection, Emma, was appropriately shown very little so as to enforce his idolization of her. Finally, the strange hood Virgil befriends had some really snappy, witty scenes, although he carried a weird accent that faltered every now and then.

Virgil and Rex are working in 1994 to find a way to preserve organs outside of the body for longer periods of time. Meanwhile, Virgil's art teacher wife cares little for his work, which he clearly has been retreating into to avoid facing problems in their marriage. This continues, until Blake meets one of her 14 year old students Emma, at which point it explodes since he can't hide his infatuation. He fails to come home from working late one night, and she arrives at his lab to find a painting by the girl that she had forbidden him to purchase. This causes Blake to snap and destroy all of Virgil's work. His investors back out, Blake files for divorce, and Virgil is left feeling like he has nothing left to lose...and having found a breakthrough in the wake of Blake's destruction, with the money from the sale of his house he enlists Rex's help to freeze him for fifteen years and monitor him month to month in a self-storage facility, and the help of his criminal friend to keep tabs on Emma so he can find her when he awakes.

Of course, when he wakes up 11 years later things have not gone to plan.

The setup was written a bit better as far as story goes, but the second half took the already great humor and took it up a few notches, so I didn't mind. The story overall was clever and original, and its the first comedy I've seen in a while that was actually witty from time to time. And of course, there's lots of zany comedy to appeal to my more primitive side(which is admittedly much stronger).

I don't think I've ever seen a film made for so little money that was so consistently hilarious. Freezer Burn amazed me, and what's better than a film that amazes you? One that makes you laugh the entire time you're being amazed. Freezer Burn delivers and then some.",1266796800,5,3579,4.448170731707317
8338544,4,B001RPZE3A,"Freezer Burn: 7 out of 10: A low budget charmer is the best way to describe Freezer Burn. It has some pretty good naturalistic performances as well as some pretty funny writing.

It isn't perfect by any means and some parts, in particular the ending, fall a little flat. It is also a low budget movie, with all the limitations that come with that. If you can look past the lack of polish, there are some very fun and entertaining bits in here.

Ella Rae Peck gives a charming, and most importantly believable, performance as the objet d'underage de passion. Her smile brightens up the screen. (Great now I sound like the protagonist). She is however a realistic character and not some fantasy or tragic Hollywood concoction.

Michael Consiglio gives the other standout performance as the wheelchair bound lab assistant. He reminds me of Nicholas Brendon (Xander) on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. He has that great ability to turn a silly throwaway line into something genuinely funny.

Overall, I had a fun time. The film has a great tone. Kind of silly but also surprisingly realistic compared to a more polished Hollywood film. I certainly recommended it for both Sci-fi and low budget fans.",1248912000,2,1189,4.813725490196078
