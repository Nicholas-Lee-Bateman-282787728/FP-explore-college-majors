8593703,4,B00DJ44N3E,"Like their other 16 film collection, this gives a pretty good spread of the ""Sword & Sandle"" Genre.  While I am not a HUGE fan, or even a fan, by any streach of the imagination, it is nice to have these around for a change of pace.",1405123200,,231,3.9148936170212765
8593704,1,B00DJ44N3E,"How anyone could rate this set with four stars is beyond me. Ever hopeful, I bought this on the chance that some of the transfers would be better than what is already out there. They are worse. In fact, Mill Creek seems to have been determined to find the poorest quality prints of these movies that are available.  Out of twelve titles not one of them is even watchable. Thank goodness I only paid $5 for the set, but even that was too much.",1384300800,4,442,4.261904761904762
8593705,4,B00DJ44N3E,If your a Sword and Sandal fan youll like most of these movies. If you already own Mill Creek's Warriors 50 movies from  2010 you own all these movies already. The 2006 Warriors movie pack has all except 'Queen of the Amazons. Went to Mill Creek site to check the movies in this 12 movie set.,1376697600,9,292,4.214285714285714
