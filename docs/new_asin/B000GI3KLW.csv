8132396,3,B000GI3KLW,"If you play it in your car, it doesn't auto play through them both.  I have to crawl into the backseat and press the menu buttons to get the second one.  Little annoying to watch the same 20 minute show 1000 times before you get up the stamina to crawl back there.",1452556800,2,264,4.0576923076923075

8132401,4,B000GI3KLW,A nice addition to my 2nd grade reader.  Most of my students have not seen the Reading Rainbow series and are interested to see something new!,1372204800,2,142,4.461538461538462
8132402,3,B000GI3KLW,"The episode with the book Archibald Frisbee has a scene depicting how crash test dummies are used to test car safety and seat belts.  The scene is rather graphic and shows what happens during a crash in slow motion for an adult dummy as well as child sized dummy and infant dummy.  My 3 year old hide behind the couch and cried ""turn it off, turn it off"".  Other than this one scene the DVD is fun and educational.  I love Reading Rainbow and feel it is one of the best TV shows available to show children.  I just don't care for the scene described.",1359504000,6,550,4.2
