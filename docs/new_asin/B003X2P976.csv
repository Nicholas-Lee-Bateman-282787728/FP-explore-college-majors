4214899,4,B003X2P976,"It wasn't as much about the Grecian Gods/Goddesses as I hoped but it was a good summary of them and I learned a few things I didn't know before.  Its more about Greek battles after, but they do a good job of that.  As long as you are interested in that too, its worth it.",1373673600,10,271,3.909090909090909
4214900,5,B003X2P976,"My son wasn't very interested in learning history, but after we watched some of the battles in this set he was energized to learn more.",1371081600,,135,4.44

4214902,4,B003X2P976,"Excellent videos on ""Last Stand of the 300"" and the ""Marathon"" Video. Also, ""Battles BC: Alexander: Lord of War"" also fairly historically accurate. ""Gods and Goddesses"" also rates an ""A"" as well as ""In Search of History: Oracle at Delphi"". But,
there seems to be some repetitive other videos. Rate them C+.",1366502400,9,306,4.903846153846154
4214903,5,B003X2P976,"I teach freshmen English classes, and his was excellent to use and make worksheets for supplementary information during our Greek Mythology unit.  The students enjoyed most of them too which is always an added bonus :)",1363564800,6,218,5.055555555555555
4214904,4,B003X2P976,"I got this to use as a supplement to the unit I teach on ancient Greece to middle school students.  Several elements of it are interesting, especially using game technology to show the outcomes of battles.  I would say that, in typical history channel fashion, there is a bit of...sensationalism that goes along with the information.  While this does help keep my students interested, I have to back peadal a bit on some of the things said.",1358121600,29,440,4.688311688311688
4214905,3,B003X2P976,"This DVD set is made up of documentaries of variable quality.  The documentaries ""Gods and Goddesses,"" ""The Greek Gods,"" and ""Oracle at Delphi"" are worth watching.  The documentaries about battles are too often overburdened with computer generated images that make them at times look like video games.  The documentary ""Troy: The Passion of Helen,"" is by far the worst of all these documentaries.  This fluffy documentary is of limited interest to any history buff.  In summary, this DVD set is in dire need of some retooling.",1291766400,48,526,5.069767441860465

4214932,3,B003X2P976,"The battle DVD's were interesting, particularly when military strategy is explained. The rest are inappropriate for school children. I wish the History Channel had offered the battle disks separate from the rest, in a collection geared strictly from schools.
