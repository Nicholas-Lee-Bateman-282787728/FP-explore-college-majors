8741754,5,B0189GJ9YE,"The Journey Home was a wonderful film that highlighted both the struggles and personal triumphs of adults afflicted with Autism as well as their families.  To see how far these young people have come to acquire the skills necessary to become successful members of the community was truly remarkable!  It was amazing to see the talented staff at PCDI put Applied Behavioral Analysis techniques to work in training young people with Autism to attend to their environment in a way that then helped them acquire language, behavior, and socialization skills that they might not otherwise obtain without such treatment.  It was also inspiring to see the strength of these three families as they made their way through a very difficult process; first receiving the diagnosis, grieving the loss of what their hopes, dreams, and expectations for that child might have been, and then emerging from that to see their children flourish in ways they could not have previously imagined!  The film was excellent and I'd recommend it highly to anyone hoping to gain greater insight and understanding to those struggling with Autism.",1451520000,3,1116,5.115384615384615

Really shows how parents love for their children and perseverance for the right treatment changed their lives. I would  love to see a sequel 10 years from now as they continue learning and living their lives. I also enjoyed the bonus DVD that answered a lot of questions ""behind the scenes"".",1450915200,3,372,5.0

8741757,5,B0189GJ9YE,"The inspiring message of this expertly filmed documentary is a must see for everyone, but most especially for anyone who loves a person with autism. My son attended the Princeton Child Development Institute with Amy and Will and Bobby and James, as well as others who can now meet the challenges in their lives because of the groundbreaking work of the school. The teaching and intervention methods (based on the principles of Applied Behavioral Analysis) developed at PCDI have been replicated successfully in programs worldwide. A friend whose young grandson was recently diagnosed, said that ""The Journey Home"" has given his family so much hope for the boy's future.",1449792000,4,669,5.146788990825688
