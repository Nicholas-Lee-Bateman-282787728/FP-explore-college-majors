8621228,1,B000YODHPW,"There is no history provided here.  There is film footage from the periods.  That is all.  To call it ""history"" is very misleading and to call the footage ""remotely interesting"" would be hyperbole.

History uses a narrative or some form of outline to present information about the time and events of interest.  This ""collection"" of footage provides no outline or framework whatsoever and the footage contains very, very little information.  It is simply a collection of uninteresting footage.

The footage is certainly ""historical"", but to call these discs ""History of Fashion in Western Culture"" is similar to calling a (small) pile of dull and lackluster arrowheads, ""The History of Native American Peoples"".",1263168000,23,710,5.285714285714286
