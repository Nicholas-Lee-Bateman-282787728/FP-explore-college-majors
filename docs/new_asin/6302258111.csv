7823849,5,6302258111,"I used to watch this film with my son when he was little - over and over and over again! We loved it; it was different and unusual - and although Little Nezha's voice is high-pitched and at times annoying (to an adult), the colours, the animation and music are first rate and really magical. I can't find it on DVD.  The story follows the birth of Little Nezha and his adventures; I don't want to spoil it by revealing the details, but dragons and bad spirits and high drama are all included. Very charming, although perhaps the 'pc' state might object to little warriors battling dragons to save his people? Still a great memory from my son's childhood.",1257984000,,654,4.495798319327731
