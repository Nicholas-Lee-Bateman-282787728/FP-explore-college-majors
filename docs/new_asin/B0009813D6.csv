 One of the more ""cult"" movies from ""le splendide"" theater french troop.
  there are 2 versions: 1st theater (1975) and the same actors remake a movie (1978)
 its very sad than this dvd haven't in english or subtitles version.you will need to be very good in french language to understanding all the jokes.
 Lyrics and the show are very very funny .
enjoy it",1258070400,4,387,4.617647058823529
8058292,5,B0009813D6,"THE French comedy, well ahead of ""the dinner game"" and others. Superior cast of actors, who will ALL become famous later on (and not all as comedic actors), irreverent, delirious, fabulous stuff--not for the narrow-minded and conventional (politically incorrect but certainly not mean-spirited, just wild, laugh-out, fall-off-your-chair hilarious fun)

FIVE STARS hands down and all thumbs up",1143763200,10,392,5.87719298245614
8058293,5,B0009813D6,"Be aware that this is not the movie, but the theatrical play.

The original if you will.

No subititle, you must understand french to appreciate this comedy.

It's the best.",1126310400,12,173,4.7
