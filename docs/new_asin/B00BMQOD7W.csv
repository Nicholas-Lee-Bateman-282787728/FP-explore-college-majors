5647660,4,B00BMQOD7W,"Donovan (Danny Glover) is a slightly dyslexic nuclear physicist who has returned home after 30 years. He has dealt with a 30 year tragedy. Oh not the severe gut wrenching type of tragedy like being a Browns fan, but that of a personal loss of loved ones.

His return is clouded with mystery. Sgt. Finnley (Bruce Greenwood) leads a warm reception that soon turns strange as Donovan is consumed by 30 year old premonitions which he kept in a journal. He tries to sort things out, but unfortunately his interpretations lacks a bit of accuracy which leads to initial skepticism.

His premonitions center around an 11 year old girl (Natasha Calis) which causes alarm for Mom.

The film proceeds as a slow mystery being unraveled. It has many parts which make you think you are watching a ""Lifetime"" film. There is little action in the film and what action that does happen, is off screen. The film is about the reoccurring cycle of life. A likeable film for those who are into that sort of thing and were banging your head against the wall watching ""Cloud Atlas.""

Parental guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. One BS.",1374278400,4,1111,4.653061224489796

8570907,5,B00BMQOD7W,"Donovan's Echo is quite the excellent movie.  It contains a sophisticated story with several intriguing elements, and works a lot like a mystery that leaves the door wide open for several possible outcomes.  Perhaps in this respect it's disappointing that the conclusion could have been something bigger and more impactful since the way it ends doesn't leave me with a feeling of satisfaction, but I suppose we can't have everything.  I won't complain *too* much!

Anyway the story: 30 years ago Danny Grover had premonitions that something bad was going to happen to his family.  30 years later the events finally happen, but they don't happen *quite* like he originally thought they would.  Instead they happen involving completely different people.  Now, 30 years later, the events that Danny's character predicts involves a little girl played by Natasha Calis who Danny saves one day by pushing her out of the way from a falling saw outside a grocery store where he works, and a prediction that a nearby local bridge will collapse 15 minutes after midnight much to the disagreement of his cop friend (Bruce Greenwood's character).  Basically the story keeps going over these two portions of the story a bunch of times.  I noticed when Danny was saving the girl it could've been interpreted that he accidentally bumped into a nearby pole and thus created the falling tools, so it was interesting when this point was brought up again later.  I won't spoil what really happened.  A third portion of the story is why and how a certain car accident took place.

Anyway nobody, including Danny's friend, the little girl Danny develops a bond with or the girls mother believe a single word he says whenever mention of impending doom enter the discussion.  It comes off like Danny is basically stalking the little girl but realistically he's just fascinated and overwhelmed with these premonitions.  So everyone basically gets annoyed whenever Danny speaks since he's obviously very distracted by these never ending thoughts that enter his mind.  Nobody wants to hear about that bridge collapsing since it seems like Danny is full of crap.  However every time it seems like Danny is full of himself, another mysterious event happens that makes people rethink their stance on poor ol' Danny.

What makes the story so good however, is how so many things link together.  For example the cover of a book he checks out at the downtown library resembles a key he has.  Another example would be upon Danny reading about the elements of earth, air, fire and water they return again in the girls science project, and other comparisons take place throughout the film that are all connected to the mysteriousness of the story.  It's a very sophisticated and elaborate storyline, so paying attention is of the highest requirement.  Unfortunately some parts require a little *too* much concentration, because not everything -including the ending- makes perfect sense to me, but whatever.  That's my fault- not the movies.  I should have paid attention more closely

There's an eerie and awesome feeling of calmness while the storyline builds.  These events that Danny's character predicts take the storyline in several different directions which I appreciate.  This means Donovan's Echo is constantly interesting- never really a dull moment in its fairly short 85-minute running time.  The acting is usually good though I admit I still have a hard time believing Danny's playing such a mysterious character based on his comedic action-packed Lethal Weapon days that I fondly remember from my childhood.

Otherwise you'll find yourself intrigued by this storyline, no doubt.  Talk about a perfect atmosphere and location too (a small town).  You'll want to know how it ends though again I wish the conclusion was a little more exciting.  With such a nicely written story, a fitting conclusion seemed inevitable but it wasn't meant to be.  You'll want to know what the ultimate premonition is going to be concerning Danny's character.  Was he right?  Was he wrong?  But instead it sort of goes a slightly different route.  Still, the events make sense.  It's just a different way of going about it that I didn't see coming.  Otherwise the acting is fantastic.  I actually think the little girl (Natasha Calis) is the best actor of all.  She's very mature for her age.  Overall worth watching despite the occasional confusing moments that require the viewer to pay attention as much as he or she possibly can.  Go see this!",1435104000,,4503,5.005383580080753
8570908,4,B00BMQOD7W,This movie is a very good movie and everyone should enjoy this. My husband and I both really enjoyed Donovan's Echo.,1424390400,,116,4.571428571428571
8570909,4,B00BMQOD7W,"For me, Donovan's Echo was an inspirational reminder that the sovereignty of God is unlimited. The universe was not inevitable. It is neither an accident nor some self-existent entity of ethereal proportions exploding upon the empty stage of nebular nothingness. The universe is a work of creation and is therefore wholly subject to the will of the Creator. And unlike any documentary that may have attempted to encapsulate portions of these philosophical mysteries in a few condensed scenes featuring talking heads that move their lips in a rapid succession of lingual fireworks but who fail to say anything spiritually significant, this suspense-filled flick was enlightening and entertaining. By the way, God was never mentioned by name or even indirectly referenced in this movie although you might not know that after reading my review thus far (unless you have already seen Donovan's Echo). The topic that is dealt with has to do with how someone can be called upon to do something of the utmost importance that is beneficial to the long-term welfare of the planet perhaps by those Beings who are unseen and uncredited yet work diligently behind the scenes for the good of the many (and since they exist on a cosmic plane far above planetary mortals, they know more than any of us about everything there is to know). The chosen individual might be completely unaware that he or she has a supremely significant task to be completed during their mortal lifetime. At times when Doubt temporarily wins the tug-of-war with Faith, they might even think they are deluded or even crazy. Others who know them might share that opinion. But what matters in the end is only if the spiritually-guided person chooses to act or not to act (this going way beyond Shakespeare's ""to be or not to be"" since active participation can only be directly invoked by an act of will) and I choose not to mention anything more pertaining to what happens in this thriller so as to allow the ending to appear when scripted.",1418860800,,1999,4.882352941176471
8570910,3,B00BMQOD7W,"Earnest, well meaning and well acted story of a man caught up in past regrets and the trauma of losing his family 30 years earlier. With splendid performances by Danny Glover, Bruce Greenwood, and Natasha Calis the story manages to rise above some heavy handed screen writing and tugs at our emotions as we witness the single minded pursuit of answers to whether deja vu actually occurred.  The ""chicken little"" scenario where Donovan (Glover) tries histrionically to warn whoever might be listening of impending doom is shopworn and not executed with much originality.  As are the predictable reactions of Finn (Greenwood) to the ever-increasing warnings of impending danger voiced by Donovan.

However, the film manages to overcome its more cloying tendencies and makes Donovan's Echo a worthwhile, emotional experience.  Just not a great one.",1410739200,,845,5.2835820895522385

8570912,4,B00BMQOD7W,"Although this lacks a certain edge, it is intelligent, and thoughtful and surprisingly touching. The premise is more well developed in many similar films, and although much of the finale is less of a shock than the writers hoped, it's still a worthwhile ride. Great performance from Danny Glover.",1400371200,,296,5.061224489795919

8570914,5,B00BMQOD7W,"I never much cared for Danny Glover until I saw him in this movie. I LOVED this movie. It's one of those movies that draws you in and takes you to another place. The suspense kept me intrigued and I really believed the characters' dillemas. It was so good that I bought it for a friend of mine who was also captivated by the storyline and the suspense. I would buy again, give again and watch again. In fact, I think I'll watch it again soon!
P.S. It's VERY rare that I buy movies for friends but this one made the mark!",1385424000,,520,4.107843137254902
8570915,5,B00BMQOD7W,"A wonderful movie I just saw on Netflix (hint:  Amazon, please make this available for Prime viewers!)...such a moving, engrossing, excellent movie about the timeless cycle of life, forgiveness, and the gift of intuitiveness.  This is an understated gem.  Of course the quiet gems don't make the same splash.  Nonethless, this is an honest, heartfelt movie.  Danny Glover is a marvelous actor and a scene stealer every step of the way!  He just can't help it, his acting is that good!

Highly recommended if you are in the mood for a thoughtful movie with themes of ultimate forgiveness, which is rare nowadays.",1379116800,4,611,4.931372549019608
