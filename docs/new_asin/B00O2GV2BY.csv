8681632,4,B00O2GV2BY,"Wild East Productions offers their first Blu-Ray release with a double feature starring American Actor Robert Woods and both Directed by Maurizio Lucidi ' MY NAME IS PECOS' aka ' IL MIO NOME E PECOS' -1966 and its followup 'PECOS CLEANS UP' aka 'PECOS E QUI: PREGA E MUORI'- 1967.  The first is a straight forward revenge Western having the main character returning to his home town to settle the score with the murderers of his family played by Pier Paolo Capponi and the great Peter Carsten who does not have much to do.  It has a nice music score by Lallo Gori and crisp photography by Franco Villa.  Woods does an adequate job as Pecos which led to its sequel which had some of the same cast and crew but goes for a lighter tone and more action oriented. This time Pecos gets involved with a treasure map and a villain named El Supremo as the film becomes less a Western and more of a Saturday Matinee actioner.  Both films are presented in 2.35 wide screen ratios but the Blu-Ray I viewed seemed a bit on the dark side and are dubbed in English.  Each has Picture Galleries and
Trailers but the highlight is a 22 minute interview with actor Robert Woods who discusses his entire career including some great stories on the films he did with Director Jess Franco. The release also includes a DVD presentation with the same extras.  It's an enjoyable package and I hope that Wild East continues releasing more Blu-Rays in the future.",1468281600,6,1435,4.521235521235521
8681633,1,B00O2GV2BY,I had to give it one star to get to write something. First off Wild East give us a feast of rare movies and this is a pair of them but in the past the transfers have been great my VHS cope of Pecos is as good as this one it goes in some scenes from that lovely yellpw brow tht we sort of got used to years ago but I payed heaps for this Amazons costs have bombed me out of the market at best some parts of this are likr the old Cenicolorand with Amazons exchange rate well almost enough said if you live in the states and feel you need this buy it but if you want to get hit with a post rate like a telephone no and pay almost a $1-64 Australia for a US dollar go ahead I will now be using ebay,1451174400,,694,3.664429530201342
8681634,5,B00O2GV2BY,"I was the son of the spanish/italian barmaid in My Name is Pecos. Just joking. hahahaaha. I just want to poke fun at these bozos that say they are related to actors in the movie. lololol. Anyway, I wish she was my mother because I would have demanded to be breast fed by her for life! Ha! Anyway, the print is very nice for both movies. Both have minor blemishes and flaws but the best prints by far anywhere around. I have My Name is Pecos on the westerns unchained 25 pack and that is a really bad transfer so this is a welcome pleasure. On to the story, Pecos is a stranger in town and he doesn't like the booze. Gets into it with a gang and gets caught up in all sorts of hellfire. My tortured mom (hot damn, I wish!) sure is put through poor hell. But Pecos is there to sympathize. Ends with a cool stand off only Pecos can devise. Pecos Cleans Up is more goofball comedy spaghetti western style. Pecos is the straight man of course and a couple treasure hunters seek him out them find gold. Cool hispanic cult tries to stop them. Fun all around and worth nearly 30 bones. I got mine on Wildeast.net for 30 buckaroos! Can't wait for the next edition, The Wild and the Dirty and Bastards Go and Kill Chacos! Hope that sucka finally gets a release. You know how we spaghetti addicts love our remastered anti-heros on discs! Adios, partner!",1420416000,2,1342,4.28740157480315
