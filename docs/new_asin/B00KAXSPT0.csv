8657026,5,B00KAXSPT0,"I'm so glad these movies are available. I enjoyed all the movies. I got into the One Piece Manga and Anime 3-4 months ago and I've jumped right into the deep end. I was worried I wouldn't be able to find the early movies easily, but here they are! For those of you buying these DVDs in the United States: These DVDs won't work on U.S. DVD players or laptops (If your laptop is new it may switch region types maybe 3 times, but you have to be careful your laptop doesn't permanently stay in an outside region dvd player mode, so I don't suggest you play these on your U.S. laptop. I bought an All Multi Region DVD player (I bought this version: ""Philips All Multi Region Free HDMI 1080p DiVX DVD Player Remote Control"") and an HDMI cable to watch these DVDs and all of them worked wonderfully. I have already purchased the second collection of One Piece movies.",1488585600,,860,4.3478260869565215
