2545631,5,B000EXAGIY,Fun and effective! Couldn't have been happier! Love Gillian and Teigh - they really know how to motivate! Can't wait to try Latin flavor!,1361145600,,137,4.75
2545632,4,B000EXAGIY,"I love Yoga Booty DVDs but I wish there was a little cuing when Gillian & Teigh go from one dance sequence to another.  They start right off dancing without showing you how to do it at first.  It was a fun DVD to work with and I'll still continue to purchase more in their series.  Besides 60's type dances, they also incorporated some ballet moves.",1342483200,,349,4.257575757575758
2545633,5,B000EXAGIY,"Honestly- this reminded me of a quirky/silly version of zumba. It is so fun and the instructors made me smile- literally! It's a decent little 40 minute workout total (20 min Go-G0 plus Yoga/Ballet). I love how they add on to the end of each set. It makes it easier to follow along in my opinion. After doing this a few times I bet I will have all of the moves down, but it will take a little bit. I highly recommend this if you want a fun workout or just to get moving a little without straining yourself!",1335830400,,506,4.121212121212121
2545634,5,B000EXAGIY,"I love all of the YBB workouts that I have tried but this one is my personal favorite. It gets my heart rate up the most and is more high impact. The moves are hilarious as always; the chicken, tequila, sink and swim, squirt gun, and Bond girl. I need as much motivation to get myself to do cardio and these girls always manage to do so. And they are easy on the joints. Nothing beats having so much fun while exercising.",1335571200,,421,4.146341463414634
2545635,5,B000EXAGIY,This was such a fun workout. Gillian and Teigh are so fun and full of life. if you want a workout to love this is it.,1304380800,,117,3.5384615384615383
2545636,4,B000EXAGIY,"If you're not feeling overly energetic, this is a great video.  It's about 30mins, including the dance and booty sculpting, so it covers the minimums.",1249344000,,150,5.0
2545637,5,B000EXAGIY,"I got this DVD today and I love it. It was a very high impact cardio workout for me personally. This is one thing that I don't understand though, I get a workout everytime and while the ybb seris is easy compared to billy blanks tapes , it's easier on the body so your not jarring your joints in the body. I sweat everytime and get better results everytime. The people that complain this is too easy , I think our one really fit like a muscle body builder or they are not doing the dancing to their best of ablities (no offense!) With every YBB workout , I have sweated, and noticed results everytime. These girls are very posistive and uplifting and encourage you to do the best.

In this certian workout film you start off a warmup consisting of yoga stretchs,mudras and mantras. Then you go into the cardio dance part , where Teigh and Gillian did an awesome job of researching the dance moves.
Start of a with a shimmy,then you do a little skip that requires rolling your sholders back to center of the floor and continue skipping to other side. Then you proced to do some hip jerks, jumping jerks, swimming ,chicken, and the squirt gun. It sounds corny and you might feel corny,but don't hold back, let go of the thought of being to corny . Your in your house, nobody is going to see you, except family members!
After the cardio dance section you enter into a ballet segment that includes alot of blance,calf ,thigh, and glutes work. After ballet you use the squishy ball and do a seris of workouts (such as the bridge) to firm you glutes and inner thigh muscles. You do some more yoga moves that focuses on stretching out your legs( trust me you will be grateful for this) it concludes with you sitting in an easy pose and doing a mudra that makes you feel like a goddess.

You should not be dissapionted with this workout. If you don't sweat at all during the workout, I encourage you to give it one more try , because you really should be sweating  and seeing/feeling the results.",1232668800,6,1988,4.396739130434782
2545638,3,B000EXAGIY,"If you're an advanced exerciser, these certainly aren't for you, but I do intermediate work-outs (mostly Firm) and these are fun to put in on a lighter day, or after I've been sick and need to get back into working out. The instructors are high energy and remind me of the Jazzercise instructors from the classes I took a gazillion years ago. Upbeat, positive, funny/silly! This workout is a little silly and campy, but it's FUN. Have your remote ready so that you can pause it before the standing leg ballet segment (after cardio), cuz it helps to add some ankle weights--the hardest part for me was working on my balance!! After this work-out, time permitting, I often do a true yoga stretch tape to give me a little more ummpph. It's short and sweet, don't expect to break much of a sweat unless you're out of shape. Just think light, fun and campy!",1228176000,3,852,4.538961038961039
2545639,5,B000EXAGIY,"This workout is fun. Think 60's beach movies and you'll get the idea. I recommend getting a resistance band prior to doing this, because I don't think you will get much out of the second half which is a toning set without one.",1197331200,2,226,4.27906976744186
2545640,4,B000EXAGIY,"Go-Go is another YBB video filmed live in the Swerve studio with instructors Gillian, Teigh, and a class of their students (along with Ravi, the drummer). The longish (9 minutes) warm-up begins as usual in a seated position with a rubbing together of the hands to create tapas, or heat. Ujayyi breathing comes next, although Gillian and Teigh provide little instruction on this beyond ""breathe slowly through your nose."" Next comes a kriya, a flowing two-part movement performed on the inhale/exhale while mentally repeating the mantra sat nam (""truth""). After holding your arms in a mudra (gesture) and setting your intention for the practice, you'll move to a hands and knees positon for spinal rolls. Next comes down dog, another kriya, and boat pose; the warm-up finishes with rolling up your mat in sync.

The cardio portion of the workout consists mainly of 70s-type dance moves. As always, Gillian and Teigh teach in a take-it-from-the-top fashion, although because the moves are generally pretty easy to learn, I find their TIFTing more tolerable than I might otherwise. Below is the sequence of the moves included (hopefully in the correct order!) along with a brief description of each:

shimmy--shoulder shimmy performed while leaning forward, then while stepping each foot forward in turn

side push--a single hand push to the side while moving your hips to the other side

mask--pulling a single hand across your face ala Pulp Fiction

skip to the side--a sort of bop to the corner while alternating moving the hands forward, then rolling both shoulders back together as you bop back

step jack with chicken and tequila--a no-impact jumping jack performed by stepping out on one side, then the other, followed by flapping your arms like a chicken to each side and bringing your arms forward and back in the way that Pee Wee Herman danced to the song ""Tequila""

jerk--raising your arms alternately overhead while bouncing from side to side

YBB bunny hop--hop to one side, look forward, hop back, then do a goofy run in the middle before repeating to the other side and ending back in the middle with a ""serious"" run

piston--basically a booty shake from side to side, move forward, repeat, move back, and do it double-time

turning jerk--same as the jerk, but starting facing one way, then do a 180 turn while jerking double time, then repeat to the opposite side

water gun--hop forward like you are pointing a gun, hop back

pony--a simple spin while raising and lowering your arms

thumbs/hitchhike--hoping several steps forward and then back, first moving both thumbs back, then one arm at a time as if you were hitchhiking

swim/dive--alternately roll each arm back as if you were swimming, then mock jumping in the water while holding your nose

The cardio segment stops rather abruptly after about 16 minutes, and Gillian and Teigh quickly have you move into a first position with your feet to set up for some ballet legs work. This segment is quite short (3.5 minutes), and although I used my ankle weights, I didn't feel I got much out of it, mostly because the repetitions were too few (just for comparison's sake, I really DO like the ballet portion from the original/basic YBB video). Basically, you do a few leg extensions to the front, move the leg behind you and do some leg lifts, balance while moving the leg in and out, then bring the leg front and down before moving on to the other side; there is one longer set followed by two quick ones. I will most likely skip this section when I use this video in the future.

Then it's back to the floor for some glutes work using the YBB squishy ball (I used my Pilates fitness circle, which I've found to be a good substitute in all the YBB workouts I've tried). Although this segment was only about 4 minutes long as well, I felt the work a lot more here, both in my glutes and in my inner thighs. You remain on the floor for the cool-down, which starts with a nice, 4-minute stretch segment focusing on the hips and glutes. The last 2 minutes of the cool-down are performed in a seated position: you'll do another Kriya, again repeating sat nam silently to yourself, and then finish with a self-love mudra and mantra for a total workout time of just under 40 minutes.

This is the second YBB Live! video I've tried, with the other being Hip Hop Abs. Although I found the cardio in this video to be a bit more intense than in HHA--there is more hopping and jumping, and my HR stayed in the zone virtually the entire time--I preferred HHA for several reasons. First of all, although the moves in Go-Go are easy to learn, they didn't feel quite as fun to me as in HHA. Also, because some of the moves were pretty goofy (especially the chicken!), I often found myself doing my own thing rather than following Gillian and Teigh exactly. Secondly, I noticed that Gillian and Teigh didn't cue as well as usual here, making several mistakes and sometimes failing to accurately mirror cue. Third, as mentioned above, I didn't get much out of the standing ballet moves, and I can't envision repeating ever this segment. In conclusion, I felt that this workout could have been improved by having a shorter warm-up, longer cardio section, and skipping the standing ballet portion to go straight to the floor work, where some abs work could have been included. But despite these criticisms, I DID enjoy this workout, and I look forward to adapting it to fit my needs in the future.",1142812800,21,5444,4.719704952581665

8115572,5,B000EXAGIY,"Love this DVD. We've done Yoga Booty Ballet for several years. This was t replace a dvd that was scratched beyond use. It's fun and dancy without taking a ton of coordination. The moves are pretty simple. The gals that lead the routine are cute, and i never found them annoying, screechy, fake sounding...

Also, for those that care, I'm particularly pleased with he fact that as far as i remember, nowhere does it say the word ""Sexy"".  No ""sexy arms"", or ""sexy butt"" This is a rare bonus and means that I can do this fun routine with my fourth grade daughter, without concern for influencing her to worry about sexy at her tender age.",1492905600,,635,4.4655172413793105

8115574,5,B000EXAGIY,"I owned one of these DvDs for years and finally unwrapped it. I got better results when I actually did the exercises, rather than move the package from one place to another. I had not exercised in years and decided to try this program  because I was bored and wanted something to do. (There are several available. I own all of them now.) This is a good fitness program to get someone back into a fitness routine, for it includes basic exercises (some with weights, exercise bands or a squishy ball) , yoga, dance and ballet moves. The instructors are fun, and the routines are not as easy to do as one might think. Routines are taught in an effective manner; one part at a time with enough repetitions that you are ready to do the complete routine at the end. In the past year and a half,  I have lost weight and become stronger and more toned. When my friends ask what I have done, I say it all started with Yoga Booty Ballet. Honestly, if there was a class taught where I live, I would go, partly for exercise and partly for mental therapy. I truly lifts my spirits!",1474156800,,1068,4.308457711442786

8115580,4,B000EXAGIY,"I'm new to the YBB DVDs, having just learned of them in the past year.  Although it's an older program from 2005, Go-Go, and YBB, are different from any other fitness DVD I've ever used.

The instructors, Gillian and Teigh, are upbeat and sincere.  They are fun and encouraging.

The music features a live drummer, Ravi, who I think is on all the YBB Live DVDs.  I didn't know what to expect with a name like ""Go-Go"" in it, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it's not ""surf"" music, which could get old when doing a DVD multiple times.  The live drumming is fun.

The program starts off with a few minutes of kundalini inspired yoga, then moves into about 15 minutes of cardio, followed by about eight minutes of some core and glute work using a squishy ball. I substituted a foam yoga block, and it seemed to work well.  It ends with a few minutes of meditative yoga.

The set is brightly lit, has a hardwood floor, has exposed brick walls and features lots of brightly colored fabric panels hanging in the background, softening the gym feel given by the bricks.

There are maybe eight background students who are real students at their Swerve studio.

Although this isn't the most challenging DVD, it's fun and different.  If you're new to exercise, returning to exercise or recovering from an injury or illness, this is a fun DVD to use.  I'm a yoga fan, so I really enjoyed the kundalini inspired opening and closing of the workout.",1389916800,,1444,4.528957528957529
