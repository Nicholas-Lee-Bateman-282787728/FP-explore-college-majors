2833872,5,B000Q7ZL3I,This is a great cartoon for kids...not only is it entertaining but there is a subtle message that the kids can learn from. They learn about bugs...and a lesson in morality. (Again the lessons are subtle) My kids love it and unlike some other programs it makes learning fun.,1224633600,4,273,4.591836734693878
2833873,5,B000Q7ZL3I,We saw this once on TV and my daughter just had to have it. This is where we got the best price for it.,1215993600,4,103,3.3333333333333335
2833874,5,B000Q7ZL3I,"Growing up Creepie is a wonderful program.  The previous reviewer did a good job telling you about Creepie and her family, so I'll just say that Creepie is a wonderful role model.  She is proud of her family even though they are different and she enjoys being herself without having to follow the crowd.
Creepie's mother is the coolest character of all...a praying mantis!  Never fear, though...Caroleena has a strict policy and NO LONGER eats friends or family.
Love this show!",1201305600,7,478,4.8765432098765435
2833875,5,B000Q7ZL3I,"This is a show about a girl who is learning to live in a world full of humans. Why? Because Creepie was raised by her loving family of bugs and arachnids (spiders). This show is entertaining and certainly interesting. There is always a short segment at the end, narrated by Creepie herself, on bugs and how fascinating they can be. She discusses how some bugs can paralyze their victims before swallowing them whole, and the way some can catch other bugs alive and stick them in their nest so that their children can eat them.
And if that creeps you out, you may or may not like this show.
Another thing you might want to know is there is really more to it than meets the eye... for instance, it looks like it might be for younger kids but it could be for younger teens, as well.
The DVD itself does not have as many episodes as a fan would have hoped for. As of now, it looks like the show has been canceled, and the remaining episodes may or may not be released on DVD, which is bad news for everybody. The special features are actually pretty good, and I think that it'd be worth it to buy the DVD for sure.",1197504000,4,1110,4.215962441314554
2833886,5,B000Q7ZL3I,It was exactly how it was described thank you we like the DVD :),1438905600,,64,3.642857142857143
2833887,4,B000Q7ZL3I,"My kids became addicted to this short-lived series well before they could appreciate its full subversiveness.  My son loved the theme song and would sing along with it.  It may not seem so unconventional given the cultural sophistication of some of today's animation, but it should find a place in the hearts of a lot of odd kids out.",1438905600,,334,4.6440677966101696

2833891,5,B000Q7ZL3I,My nieces loved it.  I had to practically drag them away from it to eat dinner.  I like that there was always some insect facts (and sometimes other animal facts) inserted into each show.,1406160000,,187,4.470588235294118
2833892,3,B000Q7ZL3I,This is such a neat series. I just wish they could have put the whole first season into one package.,1394668800,,100,4.05
2833893,3,B000Q7ZL3I,Definitely not a comprehensive compilation of the entire series or even a season but it is still a good collection of select episodes from a good show. Got it for my nieces and nephews. They enjoyed the show when it was on the air and now that it is no longer available on television I think they appreciate having at least a few episodes they can watch whenever they want.,1383523200,,373,4.3428571428571425
2833894,5,B000Q7ZL3I,"I stumbled upon this show on some cable channel, then they took it off the air. Too bad I could only find 1 season to purchase.",1376438400,,127,3.923076923076923

2833898,5,B000Q7ZL3I,I really miss this show! I am glad to have this DVD! Growing Up Creepie is a well-made cartoon that has style and is educational too!,1358294400,,133,4.153846153846154
2833899,5,B000Q7ZL3I,My son fell in love with this show and then our cable company canceled the channel it was on.  Now he can watch Creepie and all of her bug friends whenever he wants!,1339372800,,165,4.0
2833900,4,B000Q7ZL3I,"""Growing Up Creepie"" is without a doubt the craziest idea for a children's show sold as ""educational television"" since producer Jean Chalopin managed to sell a 39-episode animated adventure serial involving all of the wildest and most radical theories regarding the mysteries of pre-Columbian South and Central America, including lost civilizations, highly advanced technology, and the lost continent of Mu (Hiva), as an educational program by concluding each episode with a short live action documentary segment explaining the facts or in some cases the theories behind the plot devices used in that episode: the Nazca lines, the lost continent of Mu (Hiva in this show), the Amazons, etc.:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mysterious-Cities-of-Gold/dp/B001QKB2X2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mysterious Cities of Gold</a>.

""Growing Up Creepie"" is no less crazy: a cartoon about the trials and tribulations of a girl raised by bugs (you read that right, ""bugs"") as she tries to fit in at middle school with students and faculty who've experienced more conventional upbringings, trials such as a reanimated frog corpse on the rampage, a ghost moth, a possessed doll, giant moth creatures preying on campers, a vengeful waterbug, a plague of locusts, Bugfoot, getting sucked into a video game about battling giant mutant millipedes, a half tarantula/half human boy, etc.,...

you know, ""the usual"".

The ""educational"" bit comes in at the end when Creepie narrates a short live action documentary segment about the bug or bug-related subject of the just seen ""half"" episode.

Given the source material, this should have been a five star review, but I had to take off a star for it being one of the worst DVD packagings of a TV show I've ever seen, and I'm being generous at that!

First of all, having 2 seasons of 26 half hour episodes (or 52 ""half"" episodes since each show contained two complete 11 minute stories) to choose from, it is rather pathetic to put out a single DVD containing exactly SEVEN ""half"" episodes (77 minutes total!).

Second, why were the ""half"" episodes chosen so seemingly randomly?  You've got five from the first season and two from the second, arranged non-consecutively, and in NO case were both halves of a single episode included.  The seven included are not really the best or even a good representation of the show or introduction to it.  In particular if you are just going to pick and choose episodes, you ought to include the origin ""half"" episode, # 49, ""Creepie Crawling"", which tells how a human baby was left on the doorstep of Dweezwold Mansion, taken in by the bugs who lived there, and raised to be a girl named Creepie Creecher.

These are the ""half"" episodes included, with ""half"" episode numbers based on the original air dates:

04. Frogenstein
10. Night of Fright
06. The Case of the Mysterious Moth
25. Creepie Friday
31. Nightmare on Locust Lane
29. Are You Afraid of the Moths?
19. Creepie's Living Doll

The Bonus Features, an episode of ""Corwin Unleashed: Creepy Creatures"" and a trivia game, weren't bad, but more ""half"" episodes would have been a much better choice.

With the show now apparently cancelled there may be no more DVD's, which might be a mixed blessing.  Perhaps now the DVD rights will pass to someone willing to issue a series of DVD's or a boxed set worthy of the twisted genius of this wonderfully ""wicked"" (and surprisingly educational) show.",1313366400,10,3465,5.142348754448399
2833901,5,B000Q7ZL3I,This is a great cartoon for kids as well as adults.  My wife is a kid at heart and loves it! I hope that Amazon is able to sell this again very soon!!  She was very sad when we could no longer purchase. :(,1294358400,,205,3.6363636363636362

2833904,5,B000Q7ZL3I,"Creepie is THE BEST!!! It's definitely a kids' show, but awesome for all ages. I'm in college with no kids of my own and I LOVE IT! It has no innuendos like some kid's shows (where they add in ""adult"" content for the parents). It's just fun and awesome. I told my husband I was going to be Creepie for Halloween, lol.
