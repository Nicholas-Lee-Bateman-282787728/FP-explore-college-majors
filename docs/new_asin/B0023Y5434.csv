3842591,5,B0023Y5434,"I was looking for a History Channel documentary-movie on Wyatt Earp to go in my video collection of the historical figure who is arguably the West's most famous lawman.  I found another source that referred me to ""Cowboys & Outlaws"" which I found at Amazon, and ordered this DVD.  I was not disappointed!  None of the previous four reviewers, however, provided a complete title listing for the six movies that comprise this two-DVD set.

Disc One:
1. The Real Lonesome Dove (re: Charles Goodnight, Oliver Loving)
2. The Real McCoy (re: Joseph McCoy)
3. The Real Billy the Kid

Disc Two:
4. The Real Wyatt Earp
5. Range War (re: Johnson County War, WY)
6. Frontier Hitman (re: Tom Horn)

Each story is brilliantly colored and informative.  It's worth the purchase!",1340841600,40,763,4.778625954198473

3842594,5,B0023Y5434,"Cowboys and Outlaws is a great movie, full of precision, facts, and no-nonsense knowledge, something that Hollywood Cowboy movies have buried long ago.
What I loved the most is how realistic it was, and how durable, going from Billy the Kid to Joseph McCoy, and teaching you easy to remember things all the way.
The most interesting fact was that being a Cowboy wasn't boy scout camp, or that hero's lonesome range stereotype it's cut out to be. It was gritty, tough, and dangerous life out in the West, and this movie reliably turned facts into a brilliant documentary that earns it's name.
All in all, if you want a good Cowboy Documentary, this is it.",1307059200,21,654,4.646551724137931

My great-grandmother being a Goodnight, I feel there is so much more to this story that could be told. Perhaps a little more about the Palo Duro  Canyon and  how Oliver Loving and Col.
