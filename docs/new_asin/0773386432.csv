7789291,5,0773386432,"The last three Sharpe movies (unless they take a young Sharpe to India or an old Sharpe to his final adventure in South America.) are a fitting close to the series.  A lot of loose threads are cleaned up as our characters driven together by Napoleon are finally released into the world without him.
SHARPE'S REVENGE closes out General Calvet, and his trusted servent Gaston, General Ross, Captian Frederickson (one of the best supporting characters in the series) and of course Major Ducos who is the classic foe for Sharpe.  It is a story well acted and visually satisfying.  In terms of story it is the best of the three.  The transformation of Sharpe's wife begins here and is superior to the book as it builds on the previous movie which was an origional story.  Since she avoids tempation only by the aid of Harris (who's absence along with Hagman is painful)her failure becomes credible.
SHARPE'S JUSTICE gives us a peacetime Sharpe and Harper trying to adapt to a peacetime life.  The loss of Harris is made up to some degree by the return of Caroline Langrishe as Lady Anne ( much more interesting than his French lady )and the addition of Philip Glenister as Truman.  I have now seen Glenister in two period pieces of that time (the 2nd being as Hobbs in the latest Hornblower movies)and he seems born to it.
  The plot is interesting and different as Sharpe finds himself in a situation and an enviorment that he is unable to cope with.  It isn't done as well as it could be, but I think this is due to the script and plot more than the acting.  The scenes concerning Sharpe's wife are totally contrived.  They are the only reason this set fails to get five stars.  As the picture come sans the war the action level is also down, but we expect this so it hurts very little.  Worth a watch, just fast forward over Sharpe's wife  (unless she is with Lady Anne) after the first viewing.
SHARPE'S WATERLOO is a spectacle and a tough one.  It is the most fameous battle in European history and the battle scenes almost steal the entire show.  In terms of character development it is grand.  Jane finally becomes the full fledged villian of the piece and she and her lover are played to perfection.  The Prince of Orange fails the villany test as his errors are mostly of stupidity until the very end.
Harper is actually more interesting than Sharpe in this one, and the return of the team of Harris & Hagman is great (""Prusians ahh"").  It is the only one of the Sharpe movies where the battle drives the characters and not vice versa.  This is due to Waterloo's place in British history.  Waterloo is the star and all of the characters are caught in its pull driven toward Europe's and their own climax.
Quite a finish.",1013299200,25,2724,4.516326530612245
