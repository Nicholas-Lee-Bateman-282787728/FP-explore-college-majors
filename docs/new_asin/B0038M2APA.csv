4086042,4,B0038M2APA,"If anyone happens to look at my Location, they will note where I live.

Now I believe the location in this pilot, must be by a different name...?

Besides that, I just wanted to say, good episode, but a lot of ""cliche"" props, as well as voice acting was used. None the less decent little episode. Really liked our main character, and while I want to see him kick more ass... I also want to get to know him more. What makes the guy stick to his principles.. how did he develop said principles..

What makes him tick?

Look forward to seeing more.",1269043200,2,545,4.262135922330097
4086043,5,B0038M2APA,"Very good (not great) pilot episode.  Olyphant is stellar and his nemesis in the pilot episode is a worthy match.  Doesn't have the grit of HBO's Deadwood but the ""lone wolf lawman"" theme runs throughout.  FX's challenge will be to make sure that the lead character isn't a doppelganger of Olypant's character in Deadwood.  This show could go in many directions and I can't wait to see the storyline unfold.

And nearly ALL of the acting is spot on.  Timothy Olyphant knocks it out of the park with portrayal of Raylan Givens.  He's the perfect incarnation of the character I read in the original Elmore Leonard short story ""Fire in the Hole"".  But Olyphant's is not the only amazing acting performance here.  Justified renewed my appreciation of Nick Searcy.  I've just looked at the cast list on IMDB and the fact of the matter is, EVERYONE does a killer job on this show.  And the guest stars, including Mary Steenburgen, Sam Elliott and Alicia Witt are all amazing.  If you like westerns, you'll love this modern western.  Has a lot of the same appeal as Longmire.",1518134400,,835,4.6506849315068495

4086085,5,B0038M2APA,"I have watched the complete six seasons of Justified.  It is different kind of crime drama sited in Harlan and Lexington Kentucky, with memorable characters played by outstanding actors.  The plot moves along with many subplots, that twist and turn.  As you get to know Raylan Givens, the hero and anti-hero in this film, his character will compel you to view the entire series.  Be prepared for violence and bad language.  These folks play for keeps.  I guess Kentucky, as seen from this series, is not all blue grass and fine horses.  5 stars from this devoted viewer.",1517788800,,570,4.755102040816326

4086109,5,B0038M2APA,"Rarely have I seen a more entertaining show. We do watch quite a bit of law enforcement, crime dramas at our house but tend to gravitate to the better ones in the genre. For us, this is in the category of one of the better ones to come down the pike. When a series ends and you are sad about it, it says a lot about how good it is. We waited a couple of years and started Justified again from the beginning.

The characters, dialogue and stories feel right. This show never had a ""jump the shark"" episode and didn't need one. Quality writing, acting and directing make for a show to look forward to each and every episode.

To me, the thing that makes this so much fun to watch is Raylan Givens' trademark is not so much his Stetson hat or quick draw, but his use of psychology on his opponents, the way he can talk his way out of many situations, extract information or just get what he wants without firing a shot. Like ""Columbo"" and his ""just one more question,"" Raylan has the gift of the gab and uses it skillfully.",1515283200,,1020,4.198979591836735

I remain hungry for more!
The Protagonists never cross the line and the Antagonists are always sympathetic.
I have lived near the area where the story is based for almost 30 years.  As a transplant from Northern Michigan, I am acutely sensitive to the glottal accent. They did not miss a single beat with the local slang nor twang.

I wasn't sure about starting the series because I wanted action and this looked a little hokey.  I've watched 6 episodes of Justified so far and it doesn't feel hokey at all. So much is packed into each episode, it kept me glued to the screen for the entire 45 min which actually felt like 5 minutes. I'm so happy to have stumbled on Fortitude!

It was compelling, kept me wondering what would happen next, and had great moments of humor.  What really made it great was the compassion that US Marshall Raylan Givens shows for the people from Harlan, Kentucky -even though they are so crooked and he is dedicated to upholding the law, he seems to understand them and have empathy.  The characters in this series have depth. Of course, I love Timothy Olyphant  as Raylan.  Great acting! Walton Goggins as Boyd Crowder, Joelle Carter as Ava Crowder and the actors that play Raylan's colleagues, Art, Tim, and Rachel.  I'll miss them all.  I loved the last sentence in the finale.  It brought everything full circle.  No spoilers, so I won't tell you who are what- but it's the best ending to a series that I have seen since Hawkeye left Korea.

I was not aware of the series until I watched the movie, HITMAN with Timothy Olyphant, then heard about his TV work. In JUSTIFIED Elephant plays a US Marshal who is moved from Miami after a shoot out with a drug gangster, his next assignment is back home in Kentucky where he grew up, among the mine workers and local drug sellers. Now a deputy marshal he has to uphold the law, and it's not always easy. The acting, the characters, and the dialogue is good, as is the local color. Highly recommended.",1494288000,,620,4.4

4086501,2,B0038M2APA,"Simple-minded plots insult even Eastern Kentucky.  What bothers me is that few things about the show ring true.  The accents are a Hollywood version of how they think people in Kentucky speak. Its not even close to being authentic.  Some of my relatives are from Eastern Kentucky, and Ive listened to that damn accent all my life.  Its similar to how country music singers perform with their own accents but much stranger.  People in Eastern Kentucky artificially speak with an extreme nasal whine.  Its like they force their voice box up to their sinus.  Its not pleasant to hear.  Add extremely poor grammar to that sound.
Harlan, Kentucky, where the program is supposed to be set is not the picturesque image of a small town as portrayed by the program ... shot in Pennsylvania.  Harlan is the picture of decay and poverty.  Where once nice houses stood, rundown mobile homes are parked.
There a certain repetitiveness in episodes of Justified ... no doubt because the overall storyline is so shallow and mindless.  While Timothy Olyphant is a nice-looking fellow, he's a one dimensional actor with predictable expressions and behavior.",1492214400,,1139,4.973544973544974

4089257,5,B0038M2APA,"I was surprised at how much I have enjoyed this series, since I generally don't go for violence....but this is not gratuitous, it's completely in context and also interspersed with humor.  This show captures the feel of an Elmore Leonard piece very well, and the casting is spot on.  Not only is the Raylan Givens character flawlessly executed, but the villains are wonderful.  Boyd Crowder is like a reverse image of Givens...and neither is all good or all bad, but have a depth that keeps being revealed.

I suspect I partly enjoy this series so much because it reminds me a great deal of my time practicing law in rural Illinois....",1485129600,,635,4.693693693693693

4090243,5,B0038M2APA,"I watched this series from Day 1 on original TV network. I loved it from start to finish. In my opinion, it preserved and projected the best from the original westerns of the 1950s.",1483920000,,181,4.352941176470588
4090244,5,B0038M2APA,Raylan Givens is one of the most interesting characters ever created. He is likeable but fundamentally flawed at the same time. Timothy Olyphant does an amazing job with Raylan making him someone you want to cheer for but also someone you want to chastise like a child. The dialogue is funny and at the same time disturbing. This is perhaps my favorite show ever to be honest.,1483920000,,376,4.626865671641791

4090568,4,B0038M2APA,"This is an okay series, worth the watch.  Acting, sets, production etc. are well done.  The stories are somewhat lacking, in my opinion, and tend to end without the viewer wanting more.  There is some fairly minor segues between shows, but each episode stands on its own.  A good series, but not a great series.  I will continue watching the remaining seasons.",1483488000,,360,4.741935483870968
4090569,5,B0038M2APA,"I  have now watched 11 of the episodes of Justified's FIRST season; it is an outstanding series and I am looking forward to watching many engaging episodes (and seasons!) in the future. I pretty much gave up, long ago, on finding anything worth watching on TV, other than an occasional ""find"", of which Justified has turned out to be a shining example. Having just invested (in desperation) in Amazon Prime and Fire TV, Justified immediately appeared before me, recommended. Wonderful. I was hooked from the first episode.

I am from Kentucky, now and  originally, and perhaps Justified holds a special interest for me for that reason;  I certainly remember hearing stories in my childhood (long ago) about ""Bloody Breathitt"" and the roughness and dangers of Harlan County. I know neither of those areas well myself, but do know areas not so far away in great detail.

There are several major facets to Justified' appeal. The overall  plot, and the plots of the individual episodes, are uniformly well done, and knitted together nicely. This is rather unique at a time when just ""having"" a plot is exceptional.  There is little or no ""filler""; the pace of the story is very fast, ""immersive"", and riveting. The ""ambience"" of the area of Kentucky and the character of the different people depicted are nicely captured and genuine; the characters are all well-conceived and are portrayed with actual depth. The dialogue is pithy, authentic, and very well done, as are the episodes themselves. The entire background of the ""action"" is both credible and ""natural"", and gives the characters further depth and interest. All of these aspects contribute mightily to the appeal of the series, but the central factor is that ""Justified"" is just plain entertaining.  I look forward to each new episode, with no idea of what will happen next. Wonderful!!",1483488000,2,1842,4.996732026143791

4090630,4,B0038M2APA,"Not bad. Yet, he uses the word, ""Justified,"" a lot. Wonder what the name of the show is called? As a cow boy-acting Marshall he goes back to his home town after killing a criminal in broad day light. According to the main character, ""It was justified."" So, this story is during present day, with an attempt to give a Kansas town guy and bit of an attempt at an 'old western' attitude. Barely fits the character of setting. Unsure who is his girlfriend or how they got together or who his ex-wife is, let alone....is that a third woman he was with? Watched a couple of episodes, on and off, because there again was nothing on TV that night worth watching so I attempted to watch something for free as I am a Prime member.
