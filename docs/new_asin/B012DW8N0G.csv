7347304,2,B012DW8N0G,"See the movie was pretty bland, it had a couple of known faces, but lacked actual moving story. The story line took way too long for the characters to develop correctly, and in the end you have no idea why it ended the way it did.",1448496000,,230,4.021739130434782
7347305,5,B012DW8N0G,"Such a beautiful film, poignant, witty, smart, introspective and powerful. Character development was so well done, acting fantastic, great direction--just all around excellent.",1446768000,2,176,6.695652173913044
7347306,5,B012DW8N0G,"A wonderful movie exquisitely crafted by a Director whom should be on everyone's radar!  The cast is stellar and the themes will stay with you far after the ""curtain goes up.""  TWO THUMBS WAY UP!",1446508800,,195,4.542857142857143
7347307,5,B012DW8N0G,"A wonderful movie about the ups and downs of life. Life doesn't always go the way you want it to, but when you start making changes for the better life will pleasantly surprise you. It pulls at your heart one moment and in the next you will be chuckling.",1446422400,6,254,4.204081632653061
7347308,4,B012DW8N0G,"A good movie about a young man's lot in life and the choices he has to make to achieve a better outcome.  Slow, absurd and clich at times, but kept me interested to the end.",1446422400,2,173,3.942857142857143

7347310,5,B012DW8N0G,This was an amazing movie. It was a little slow and boring at first but totally worth watching. Definitely recommend.,1515369600,,117,4.9
7347311,5,B012DW8N0G,"The movie started off as a low budget type, but 20 minutes into it, it started to acquire so much depth. Beautiful story and complicated life stories intertwined. I loved being on the positive journey with the main character. Highly recommend this movie!",1515110400,,254,4.930232558139535

7347313,4,B012DW8N0G,"This movie seems to start off a bit slow, but it actually turns out the slower pace is necessary to develop the characters appropriately.  The main character is at risk of viewers believing him to be a loser beyond redemption when in fact, it's really several of the peers he hangs with who fit that description.  The title is catchy too as it has a double meaning.  Watch until the end to catch that.",1514764800,,401,4.391891891891892

7347316,5,B012DW8N0G,"Beautiful storyline that kept me intrigued the whole way through. Some parts were predictable, but it was still cute. The overall ending explaining the subtle underlying subplot about Jen was something that I couldn't have guessed or predicted in a million years.

7347328,1,B012DW8N0G,Didn't watch more than 10 minutes and can't believe anyone would give it more than 1 star.  Demoralizing and depressing from the start and only gets worse. Can only imagine how much worse it gets after the first 10 minutes.,1503792000,,223,4.575
7347329,2,B012DW8N0G,"A film all about people letting each other down. There is some redemption at the end, but not enough to overcome the emotional letdown of most of the movie.",1503792000,,156,4.413793103448276

7347339,5,B012DW8N0G,"after reading some of the bad reviews i see that it is their opinion to have a happy movie only... SO I really appreciated the honesty and I can relate to some of these moments so sharing that experience and watching as they unfold was beautiful, and to see the maturity in the ending was all you could ask for. this story was well told and I appreciated every min of it! thank you!",1499558400,,382,4.175675675675675

7347343,5,B012DW8N0G,"Surprisingly excellent film - well done and moving. It's easy to connect with the characters and feel what they do if you've ever faced challenges in life.  However, it comes up in a search for romantic comedies - definitely not in that category.  More of a drama with some romance, tears and hope.",1498867200,,298,4.60377358490566

7347345,4,B012DW8N0G,"Bryan Greenberg captured my heart right from the beginning, not because he has it together in the movie, but because he's such a good actor and is appealing. It's a nice story of various redemptions and deals with many sad realities that can occur in people's lives. It has some interesting twists. It deals with mature themes but not in openly graphic ways. But whoever did the casting and chose the son did poor job. He's a cute kid, but a poor actor and looked nothing like his casted mother or father. The other actors did a great job, too.",1498176000,,544,4.45
7347346,4,B012DW8N0G,"This movie is soooo close to being great. Nevertheless, definitely worth watching. Sympathetic lead male in the end, somewhat realistic storyline - it's not all puffy clouds and sunshine.",1498089600,,187,5.482758620689655
7347347,5,B012DW8N0G,This is a very good movie. It's nice to see a character grow. I definitely recommend this movie,1497916800,,95,4.333333333333333
7347348,4,B012DW8N0G,This movie has a sweet ending. It reminded me of Manchester by the Sea because it is a very good movie even though it is depressing. This movie stays very steady yet pulls at the heart strings if you can relate.,1497830400,,211,4.170731707317073
7347349,4,B012DW8N0G,"I watched this only because of the title of the movie. Kept my interest. The weird thing is the day that I watched it, was a significant day for the main character.  6.17",1497657600,,170,4.151515151515151

7347354,5,B012DW8N0G,"I'm having trouble understanding why so many unsatisfactory reviews. I think it's hard to imagine going through so much in a year. Maybe some see this as fiction, but for me, it hits home. Straight to the heart.",1495670400,,211,4.578947368421052

7347363,5,B012DW8N0G,"This was a very good show.  Don't listen to the negative reviews!  It was a moving story of a man who had his priorities all wrong and was headed in the wrong direction.  Owen suffered from a great deal of loneliness, using alcohol and the party life to fill in for what was missing- human connection.  After a fall caused him to break an arm and sit in the ED waiting room for hours, he began to examine what he was doing wrong- especially in regard to his young son.  It was a great analogy to see how as the seasons of the year changed, so did Owen.  He stopped drinking, took responsibility for himself and became an adult that his son and family could be proud of.  He really stepped up in taking care of his neighbor Todd and his sister.  I loved how he made a new family for himself from close friends, a cousin, and his son- a great lesson in the truth that family is who is close to you, blood is not necessary.  Positive story that moves at a good pace to keep you interested- a real example of growth that makes one evaluate your own life to see what changes could be made.  Highly Recommend.",1490572800,8,1103,4.184834123222749
7347364,1,B012DW8N0G,"Husband said this is depressing, found it while searching through comedy genre. Definitely is NOT a comedy!",1490486400,,107,5.352941176470588

7347372,5,B012DW8N0G,"This movie started out a little cringe-worthy. Nothing about it was what I wanted to see. But then I realized that was the point. This ended up having a really great ending, and shows the depressing realities of life, that don't have to depressing anymore once you decide to do something different with your life. Really well done, and I felt it was really touching and though-provoking.",1488326400,6,387,4.791044776119403
7347373,3,B012DW8N0G,There was a good movie here. Too bad it didn't make it to the screen. I'll give it three stars because it wasn't horrible. Two stars off for not having a decent reason for the dad's change and the final outcome was lame.,1488153600,,220,4.1395348837209305

7347376,1,B012DW8N0G,"Trite, and then there is a gun.  I hung in there until the scene in the cabin when the brother reveals a gun.  I hate this aspect of my beloved country.  Can't stand it.

Also, glad there is a small bit of People of Color, but the first thinI noticed about the ER scene at the start of the movie is not one POC.

I was expecting a normal ""indy"" movie that was mediocre. It started slow with a very stereotypical, life's going hard, plot, but after a little bit you began to start really living in the character's shoes and the movie brought you into their life. It is a very realistic and sad story with a great message and great ending. This movie pleasantly surprised me and I would greatly recommend it.",1486771200,2,522,4.447916666666667

7347406,4,B012DW8N0G,"I like character movies and have patience for a slower pace--as long as the movie doesn't trail off into some fake fairytale or grim house of horrors. This quiet movie takes some surprising turns, but it always feels real. The characters make sense, and what happens is a natural outcome of who they are--mixed in with just the right amount of hope and love. So glad I watched the trailer (I'd never heard of this film) and gave it a chance. The voiceover adds poignancy without ever turning saccharine. Like the hairdresser, I hate fake sweetness. No worries about that in this movie. Highly recommend.",1486080000,2,603,4.752380952380952

This film was intense in its honest view of reality of how we as human beings learn the consequences of our actions, where we discover our own worth. This film has a searing and important message which is told with great love and honesty. Looking forward to the next work by this director. There is a subtlety to the work where the character and story work their way into your subconscious and bloom. Bravo",1485993600,4,539,5.0

He keeps writing to someone for the voice overs and sharing his inner musings added a nice dimension. These characters all feel very real, they are dealing with very tough situations. It's kind of a coming of age film in which a moy becomes a man, father, friend etc. The acting was great on everyone's part, good script and production, all the way through, very humble regular guy finds his way, and people around him do too. Some unexpected drama that brought the film into a better than just good film. It's heartwarming.",1485648000,4,781,4.468531468531468

I'm actually a fan of Bryan Greenberg's movies. This was one of his better films. The story I thought was very believable in a real world scenario and relatable in some aspects. The acting was well done. I though it was funny that Jamie Chung curses a lot in this movie just because I haven't seen her act in that way before so it looked forced a little. Otherwise I'm glad I gave this movie a chance. I look forward to finding more movies from Bryan that are as good as this one.,1482278400,,641,4.095238095238095

It would have been just fine without all the F Bombs and other 4-letter words. Also, there was a quite disgusting sex scene in a bathroom at a party. Even though both actors look like they are fully clothed, I found that scene disgusting because the girl was bent over the sink and chattering the whole time like she was having a manicure or something, and the star of the movie was going at her from behind. That scene should have been cut out of the movie, as it goes on for an embarrassingly long time with little added to the movie because of it. I would definitely not let children under 18 watch this movie. There were other events that contained adult content only and that should not be rated for 14 year olds, either. I would give it 4 stars if there had been warnings about the adult content, because I liked the way Owen's character turned his life around.",1481328000,,981,4.395604395604396

7348752,4,B012DW8N0G,"I really did enjoy this movie. You could see the development of not just the lead character played by Bryan Greenberg, but in other characters in the story. The changes he makes, and the impact of those changes on others as well, is the crux of the story. Family is important to me, and this movie illustrates that concept, as well as the idea that family encompasses more than those related to us by blood; it includes those we choose to define as our family. I think alcoholism is probably a little harder to kick than as portrayed in the movie, but is my only critique.",1464739200,3,572,4.40566037735849

A disjointed mess with unbelievable subplots about a troubled, divorced guy in his 30's taking in an assortment of misfits into his home. Unlikely to happen in real life. Then you had a Rachel McAdams clone with a lot less talent as the love interest. T.R. Knight was pretty good despite a thankless role. I stuck it out until the end.

The acting, framing, and editing comes off like a B-movie, and not one staring Bruce Campbell either. This movie wins the award for the most forced F-bombs in under a minute. This ""Film"" does an excellent job of showcasing immaturity and irresponsibility.
