2252658,2,B0007YWY8K,24 minutes to explain the end of the world?  How cute.  You would have been better off reading Revelation 6:12-17 from the good book.  It's much cheaper than buying this DVD and just as helpful!,1113955200,8,194,4.485714285714286
8054209,4,B0007YWY8K,Very interesting and frightening vision of our immediate future. I must confess that I am not as convinced about the validity of remote viewing as I am about other aspects of the book.,1488240000,,184,4.606060606060606
8054210,2,B0007YWY8K,"An interesting documentary that covers a possible burst from the Sun.  But it is mostly speculation based on remote viewing of the future, not fact.",1457481600,,148,4.92
8054211,5,B0007YWY8K,Excellent and VERY informative.... this video was pulled off of the internet and Youtube.... a MUST watch for an event that is approaching.....,1426723200,,143,5.260869565217392
8054212,2,B0007YWY8K,My gut does not like this guy. Fear and profit are generally pretty sleazy together.,1416096000,3,84,4.666666666666667
8054213,5,B0007YWY8K,YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS.  This is exactly what NASA is talking about right now.  Excellent video.,1413849600,,94,4.470588235294118
8054214,2,B0007YWY8K,"You won't learn anything you don't already know from watching advertisements of this video.  He predicted a reactor incident in Japan two years before it happened.  Actually most scientists did that too.  If you make enough predictions without time limits you'll hit most of them...eventually.

Ninety percent of the video is the standard infomercial to sell you remote viewing training.  The last ten percent is vague and mostly NOT about North America and what we should do in case of sun flares.  He gives the general advice of food and water storage that you can find in any survival manual.  I wanted to have some close friends over for a doomsday party but the video is too short and wishy-washy to make any deal out of it.  It should have just been released as a youtube video that gets a few thousand views.",1399248000,5,815,4.65034965034965
8054215,5,B0007YWY8K,"Ed Dames' the Killshot has become a global explosion... I even heard it mentioned on Fox News and even Hollywood is making a movie about this predicted event. But this is actually a topic to take VERY seriously. Everything Dames said would happen and prediction on national radio and TV shows has come to pass including the Japanese nuclear disaster. If you haven't seen the Killshot, you need to right now! The production quality is History-channel good and the information in here could actually save your life some day.",1394409600,,522,4.876404494382022
8054216,2,B0007YWY8K,I believe in esp. I have known things I shouldn't of known and so on - but- he's predicting something bad will happen to the sun some time in the future. wow!!!! anyone who has either read the bible or taken a science class knows one day the sun is going to burp out some gas and fry the earth. the question is when? if you can't tell me that your a waste of time. in the extra's he has his class predict a hurricane will hit the us that year. really?! you think a hurricane will hit the us in ------ hurricane season!!!!!!!  the reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of one is because he taught the stare-gate program.,1392681600,4,620,4.12396694214876
8054217,5,B0007YWY8K,"Many reviewers complain this movie is short, 24 minutes long, and the details of information is lacking. I agree, but if I am talking about a major catastrophe of global event, any small amount if information helps. Scientific Remote viewing is fairly accurate as it was formerly used in CIA before the politics set in and the project was transferred to military intelligence. The project is still ongoing actually was used to locate both Saddam Hussein and Bin Laden. However, since Bin Laden is a CIA operative and his family is partners with Bush family and Carlyle group, the location is known, but it is not in their interest to get him. I have watched many doomsday 2012 information, and people simply can't deal with really bad news and hence many unconsciously avoid this topic, or if they accept, they look on love and understanding, some deal with taking care of the universe. The key is to deal this shocking information as just information. I can have all the information I want to deal with a shocking event and without fear or rationalization. All I need to know is  i want the truth and if I don't want to know or will not believe it despite massive fact, than that's my problem. But I should not avoid reality or information or rationalized. Accept as is and then whatever resistance I have, than I deal with that or be real stubborn, but that's my own problem. Take care of information to be accurate and pass on after compiling it to those who can handle it. The information from review here is more than other places you can get. Basically the predicted event based on Mayan Calendar is 21 December 2012, a major planetary catastrophe is expected because of the precession. Our world's civilization according to many ancient wisdom has 4 ages, the golden age, the silver age, the bronze age and the iron age. The iron age is the last of our civilization and is called ""the age of materialism"" and hence the iron. It rusts. The precession occurs as our solar system passes through the galactic milky way equatorial zone. During the passing our solar system will AGAIN be in overlap another solar system, and one of its planet is called Planet Nibiru, which will come very close to planet earth, sometimes called Planet x. It is currently visible through Antarctica viewing station, but as it gets closer to the target date, 21 December 2012 the planet Nibiru will change earth's rotation starting a Pole shift of planet earth. Interestingly, before we get to the target date, more and more people will see the planet Nibiru with the naked eye and the authorities as usual will ignore it. They have to. They are not going to save us, but the politicians and the military might survive with vast underground tunnels as first mentioned by Phil Schneider, or the British Royal Family who owned vast real estate in one of the highest elevated city in the U.S., Denver Colorado, and the strange Illuminati symbolism at Denver Airport where many races are expected to be there. As nibiru gets closer and solar system reaches galactic plane of the milky way, he earth's magnetic field will get weaker and weaker, with less protection from Van Allen Belts and this is why bees die all over the world, they use UV, but UV radiation has gotten  more intense over the last decade and that's WHY so many UV skin products. It weakens the Van Allen Belts. and hence more planetary unstability and causes earthquake, throughout the solar system, including the Sun, but when this happens the sun sends more frequent solar flares, causing SOLAR SYSTEM WARMING, not just the earth. As we get closer to target date, the protective Van Allen belts get weak and we get meteorite showers. IT has been said, but I can never confirm it that the safest place to be is away from coastal area, It is said that safest region is where crops circles are located. The only way I can confirm or NOT confirm is to WATCH THIS movie, which might be remotely helpful. IT doesn't mean I will move the house there, I'll may be just fight it out, but at the very least I will NOT live near supervolcano around yellowstone national park, nuclear reactors, or low lying regions. During the polar shift, the real Merlin predicts that all our planets will no longer be in orbit around the sun and is predicted to be our last of civilization. O.K. Fine with me. I will still have an appointment with my dentist on 15 January 2013.  The reason why global warming exists or solar system is simply planets are getting unstable as it passes through the equatorial region of the milky way and other solar system meets and it hits the earth near misses, the planet Nibiru. This is one reason why the U.S. military makes potshots into meteorites as it prepares to protect itself when we are no longer protected with van allen belts. Obviously we're going to be hit with Gamma Radiation during 2012. The best protection is that city bubbles first envisioned by Nikola Tesla that can protect our civilization (just my silly opinion!), but our human selfishness and suppression prevents such technology to protect our human race against meteoritic shower. There won't be enough time for me or hobbyist to build this. But free energy using magnetic energy as envisioned by someone who predicted pole shift are available over the internet from so called communication with the last surviving human race. As for me I will probably practice Remote viewing myself. I wouldn't believe anyone unless I do them myself so I won't have accept so much B.S. and find them myself. The other movies I recommend is Project Horizon Episode one, and Decoding the Past from History Channel, plus any information on planet Nibiru, and also any Remote Viewing Tutorial program or silva mind control lessons to help predict the future, for possible survival. As a side note these so called remote viewers never bothered to confirm whether Apollo 11 was a hoax or not! LOL.",1209772800,6,5914,4.706563706563706
8054218,4,B0007YWY8K,"The DVD is very hsort BUT it was very entertaining. Its not just an ""end of world"" type video but actually offers detailed events and timeliens for preceading events to look for. RV is an amazing skill so I would bet that the info in this DVD may actually be correct... guess we'll have to wait and see.",1119744000,9,303,4.241379310344827
