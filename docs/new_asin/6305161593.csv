7884545,4,6305161593,"I picked up this HK action film in a for sale bin along with some other Hong Kong action films some years back, and finally got around to viewing it again tonight after many years. I must say, this is one film worth owning. I do not have as many films from HK compared to my Japanese film collection, but I have been trying to acquire more films from HK these past few years, as there are some real gems out there. Lately I have been trying to immerse myself in more films from South Korea, Thailand and China. And this film does not disappoint the viewer---especially if you are into action films.

Several reviewers have already given excellent reviews of the film; and I would just like to add that this film also gives the viewer some really terrific humor to go along with the action. And Lau Ching-Wan also gives the viewer a wonderful role as Sergeant Bill Zhu. But then everyone in the film was a treat to watch. I am playing catch up to many films from HK that I missed out on over the years, and I would highly recommend this film to all viewers, and mainly those who like a good and not over the top action film. I have an old DVD of this film, and the transfer was not that great, still the film is worth owning.

Moreover, this HK action film, ""Big Bullet"" is not only a very good action film, but it is also an extremely intelligent film. And kudos to director Benny Chan, who did a wonderful job with the action scenes in the film too! And once again, I really liked the humor of this particular film, as it is not over the top, and you will find yourself laughing in many parts of the film. I was not sure whether to give this film 4 stars or 5. That's how much I liked this film. Highly recommended [Stars: 4.5].",1187136000,2,1729,4.204819277108434
7884546,5,6305161593,"In Benny Chan's Big Bullet, Lau Ching Wan is a hard-boiled cop demoted to the emergency unit after punching a jackass superior.  Lau ends up being in charge of four cops who eventually realize that he's an outstanding policeman.  The  group becomes an excellent team by following Lau's leads and they go to war with two psychotic drug-lords.  This action packed film sports an awesome supporting cast.  You can't miss with Anthony Wong and Yu Wing Gong as the villains.  Add Jordan Chan, Francis Ng, and Theresa Lee to the mix and it's almost an overkill.  Director Benny Chan lets everyone shine and the results are fabulous.  Big Bullet will add flavor to any action fan's collection.",1137110400,7,686,4.803418803418803
7884547,4,6305161593,"The characters are particularly memorable in this movie, which is saying quite a bit about the quality of this action flick.  Lau Ching Wan plays a tough well-respected cop who gets demoted to the Emergency Unit (after he punched a superior) and joins with four other cops, each with very different personalities.  The characters are excellent and the way they play off each other is quite endearing, dramatic, and funny.  And then, there's the two evil druglord villains whom they must eventually tangle with.  Action scenes are fast and furious (occasionally confusing), and story moves quite quickly.  A highly entertaining movie.
As for the DVD, I found it pretty okay, as there are some extra trailers of other movies which was kind of nice, although DVD didn't allow me to skip through the the studio/warning setences and stuff in the beginning.",984182400,4,851,5.00709219858156
7884548,4,6305161593,"After assaulting his superior officer, well decorated cop Bill gets reassigned to the less glamorous Emergency Unit. Circumstances put Bill on the trail of escaped international criminal Professor, and his accomplice Birdie. The mechanics of this film are truly mediocre - it's a standard plot with cookie cutter characters. But the enormously talented cast, subtly humourous script, and one very well choreographed action sequence make this film quite enjoyable. Lau Ching Wan is in top form, Jordan makes the best of his cliched character, Theresa shows the same energy she had in _What A Wonderful World_, and Spencer even gets to do some football play-by-play. Francis Ng Chun Yu doesn't ham it up, for once, and puts in a solid supporting role. If you enjoyed this film, you may enjoy _In The Heat Of Summer_ even more. -P",981936000,5,827,5.0
7884549,4,6305161593,"The 90's has been far from the golden period of Hong KOng cinema, but there are still plenty of stand-out films from this period. This ranks as one of them. Recently, some directors have fallen into the trap of putting  style over content, but Big Bullet manages to reverse this trend. The story  follows a demoted cop who joins with the Emergency Unit to capture two  dangerous criminals. This unit has the usual mixture of cops each with  their own story. However, Benny Chan has managed to create an excellent  chemistry between the five heroic leads. Up against them are two of Hong  Kongs great villains, Anthony Wong and Yu Wing Gong. Naturally the sparks  fly spectatularly. Highly entertaining viewing.",947030400,2,710,4.866666666666666
7884550,5,6305161593,"When you hear of dealing with international criminals, you may think of great detectives or whatever high competent police units. This film, therefore, can give you surprise that the emergency police unit, which is  actually in relatively low level, was the main team to cope with the great  organized criminals by some reasons.
I found it is not only a great and  brilliant action movie, but also a good drama. The team, consisted of  several policemen and one policewoman who have different characteristics,  showed many precious human relationships. There are brotherhood, conflict,  collaborating as well as compromising. I love this film becasue I was  touched by their team working spirit. I felt as if I were one of  them.
Moreover, I appreciate Benny Chan who was a director of this film  so much. He has his own style to create action scenes, they are poetic  instead of too violent. I especially love the shooting scene in  Central(where is the most crowded place in Hong Kong), just see it and  you'll know how intense the shooting was. If you've already watched all  John Woo's films and hence you're hunger for seeing somthing great and  stylish action scenes, Benny Chan can satisfy your needs.
Besides the  actors in the emergency unit, I was excited by the performance of Francis  Ng. He did a short part of the film since he was killed in a busy road in  Central at the quite beginning. I was impressed the way he presented his  character.
In short, good plot, good director and brilliant actors as  well as great action scenes (though it still have rooms for improvement if  there is higher budget ) you'll find in this film. I rate it 10 out of 10!  Make Benny Chan's film as your first choice!",946166400,5,1713,4.700336700336701
7884551,4,6305161593,"This film won best action design at the 1997 Hong Kong film awards and it is entertaining throughout.  Anthony Wong, surprisingly, plays the bad guy role once again. I reccomend the film simply for its good character  developement, action, and the fact that its sync sound cantonese, a rarity  in Hong Kong cinema.",933897600,8,314,4.886792452830188
