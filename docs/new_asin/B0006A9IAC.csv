8040886,2,B0006A9IAC,"I mean I guess it was alright, but not particularly good.  The main feature is obviously pretty dated in narration with even repeated footage in the documentary itself.  The feature on Pershing is okay, though there was a better one made from around the same time by ""The Pig Picture.""  The feature on the home front could have been alright if it were longer, but it was very truncated.

I absorb all in can from WWI, so I am glad I watched this, but unless you're a huge buff like myself seek out another one.",1431043200,,510,4.336842105263158
8040887,3,B0006A9IAC,"Good video shots of course any WW1 buff would enjoy, but the naration is old and dated and the DVD is put together like a highschool class film.....There will be at TEST at the end of the film so take notes! Nice to watch but nothing new that will say..I gotta whatch it again and again.... see if your library has it available.",1220054400,,328,4.222222222222222
8040888,3,B0006A9IAC,"This 70-minute DVD is a mixed bag. The titled section of 34 minutes consists of material that will be familiar to anyone who has looked at one or two of the videos about the Great War. Most of the footage is clips of pre-U.S. entry material, such as trench warfare, howitzers firing, and ships sinking. Once unrestricted submarine warfare and the Zimmermann Telegram convince the U.S. to enter the war, the DVD shows American troops being recruited, trained and shipped to France and upon arrival, fighting. The commentary is routine and familiar. The interspersing of colored U.S. war posters is interesting though, unfortunately, of very brief duration and with no specific commentary about them.

The remaining 36 minutes of the DVD is really more interesting and consists of four so-called ""Bonus Footage"" sections. 1. The Iron Commander: a short biography of General John J. Pershing. Much of the footage here was new to me and included post-war material up to his death and funeral. 2. The Old Soldier: Duty, Honor, Country, a quick overview of General Douglas MacArthur's military career and final years. We're reminded of his achievements, as well as (though not intentionally) his affectations, for example, his smoking with a cigarette holder and his slow, ponderous speech as if he were always addressing the universe. 3. Treaty of Versailles: A New Europe, which provides a quick overview with maps of some of the changes the Great War and the Treaty brought and warnings by contemporaries of the likelihood of another great disaster in the not distant future--what of course turned out to be World War II. Finally 4: Home Front America 1917-1919, which offers some interesting footage of, for example, shipbuilding but is very brief and impressionistic.

In summary, a moderately interesting DVD more for the bonus material than for the title subject matter.",1162252800,3,1871,5.111111111111111
