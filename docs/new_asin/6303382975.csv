Claudette Colbert and Don Ameche make a cute couple together, and snappy dialogue makes this movie just hum along.  John Barrymore is wonderful in a  supporting role.

A millionaire sets her up in an apartment with clothes, an allowance, and a chauffeur.

636162,4,6303382975,"In 1939 as the war drums were beating incessantly in Europe movie audiences there and in America needed a few laughs, something to take their minds for a couple of hours off the grim work ahead in a world that had been taken over by the night-takers. I mentioned in a recent review of another screwball romantic comedy of the same period that no one could do better than to take in at their local theater the film under review there, Barbara Stanwyck and Gary Coopers Ball of Fire, to while away a couple of hours. The same is true for the film under review here, Claudette Colberts Midnight (midnight in Paris as it turned out but that film title would be taken by Woody Allen in a later romantic comedy so just midnight here).  I mentioned in the Stanwyck review that when one thinks of romantic screwball comedies from that era one usually thinks automatically of Preston Sturgis (whose Sullivans Travels was recently reviewed in this space) or George Cukor (whose The Philadelphia Story was reviewed in this space a while back) but here the lesser known Michael Leisen works some cinematic magic taking a hand at screwball comedy.

Although the pitter-patter here between the leading romantic interests is not nearly as arch from beginning to end as Ball of Fire it does have a fast-moving plotline. Here are how things developed and you can see why in the end Ms. Colbert either as Eve Peabody or Baroness Czerny was not a gold-digger. American showgirl (which is just a nice way of saying gold-digger if you get the drift) Eve Peabody, played by Claudette Colbert last seen in this space trying to get a damn American-style divorce from MacDonald Carey in Lets Make It Legal, as she debarked from the midnight train from Monte Carlo in Paris was down on her uppers (broke, okay). Too broke to even to have afforded an offered taxi ride by a smitten cab driver, Tibor Czerny, played by Don Ameche an actor whose work has not been previously reviewed in this space, which she desperately needed to keep out of the rain. But Eve was a resourceful young woman and after playing footsy with Tibor who offered to put her up in his digs, no strings attached, no visible strings anyway, found herself, after she ditched him, drawn into a concert being attended by a crowd, a rich society crowd, of the kind she was trying to crash (in order to finally break out from that Kokomo dead-end she left behind and a big reason why she gave Tibor the quick brush-off).

That is where the fun begins, the Cinderella fantasy tale come true fun. Everything Eve touched turns to gold; gambling losses got paid off, homeless after nixing Tibors offer she found herself in a swanky suite at the Ritz; her pawned clothes from Monte Carlo mysteriously arrived; and she had plenty of new clothes and a waiting chauffer at her disposal. Rags to riches in one night no wonder she kept rubbing her eyes. The mystery was soon solved though. One of the attendees at the concert Eve drifted into was Georges, an ultra-rich Frenchman, played with style and expressive flair by John Barrymore last seen in this space as a feisty wheelchair-bound old pappy to Lauren Bacall raining verbal hell down on Johnny Rico in Key Largo, no, that was his brother Lionel, make that whose work has not previously been reviewed in this space. Georges sensed looking at her maneuvers that Eve soon to turn into Baroness Czerny of high Hungarian society was just who he was looking for to help him get rid of his wifes lover. This lover, Jacques, nothing but a rich idle playboy at heart had been playing footsy with his wife Helene, played by Mary Astor and I will not be making a mistake here by saying that she was last seen as a femme fatale making Sam Spade go through hoops looking for some goddam bird in the film adaptation of Dashiell Hammetts The Maltese Falcon. Georges despite the loose moral tone of high society then (now too) was an old-fashioned kind of guy who still loved his wife and so he proposed to the newly christened Baroness that she lure Jacques away from Helene. She balked at first but seeing that she could break into that high society and plenty of dough she has longed for she finally consented.

Of course once she took on the job it was a piece of cake to dazzle Jacques away from Helene after a weekend at Georges country estate. Everything looked great. Marriage and the Mayfair swells life full steam ahead. Great until a very determined Tibor showed up and gummed up the works by acting as hubby Baron Czerny. He might have been a poor Paris cab driver but he was determined to make Eve/Baroness Czerny, hell, whoever she was his wife. And after a series of pratfalls and silly antics which had the whole estate and its inhabitants in an uproar he finally got his day in court, literally. More importantly he got his girl, his not American gold-digger girl. If you have to choose between this one and Ball of Fire take the latter. But this one is fun too.",1454803200,,4951,4.572072072072072

I noticed that a reviewer in 2008 commented that the DVD he received was poor quality -- that must have been an older edition -- be assured that this current DVD edition looks great. The producers of this disc either did a great job of restoring the film or found a print that is in near mint condition.

636285,5,6303382975,"When I go to the movies nowdays, I'm often disappointed by comedies! Hollywood now seems to feel they have to be crude to get laughs (Pineapple Express, Hangover, etc) But if those script writers would watch this film, they might see there's a better way! Instead of taking the ""low road"", they could ascend to the heights of clever, witty, sophisticated comedy that is the hallmark of ""Midnight"". This film was the brainchild of the brilliant Billy Wilder, one of Hollywood's finest writer/directors, and his collaborator Charles Brackett. The sophisticate sheen of the movie is also due to the expert direction of openly-gay (for 1939!) director Mitchell Leisen. All the stars are great in it, including Claudette Colbert, who in my opinion was never better! The scene where she sneaks into the concert, with the yapping little dog, is worth the price of admission alone! So  21st Century Hollywood, trying going ""high brow"" instead of ""low brow"" for a change! You might be surprised at the results and end up making an all-time classic like ""Midnight""!",1389398400,2,1055,4.994318181818182
636346,4,6303382975,"Although I love old movies, I am not one of those people who think nothing good has been filmed since 1940. There are genres that I believe are done better now than in the good old days--but comedy is a category that was certainly more ""golden"" many decades past.

I caught ""Midnight"" on TCM just a few months after seeing Adam Sandler's ""Just Go With It"", and the comparison makes my case perfectly. Both have the same kernel of an idea--a man gets a woman to impersonate someone else for the sake of his love life, and complications pile up and accelerate as the deception gets out of hand and harder to maintain. But in the Sandler case, the twists and turns are labored and slow, and not comically inevitable and nutty at the same time, which is essential to this kind of comedy. (Every time Sandler had to come up with a new lie to cover himself I amused myself in my boredom thinking of ways he could have handled the situation quite easily without escalating the situation--starting with his absurdly self-defeating explanation for why he's carrying a wedding ring after his night with the dream girl. Make up an ex-wife who doesn't exist? How about ""I'm holding it for a friend who's getting married and I'm the best man."" ""I found it on the street."" Or--almost the truth--""It's from when I almost got married until I found out my fiancee was cheating on me and I've carried it ever since as a reminder to never let anyone break my heart again."" )

By contrast, the plot complications in ""Midnight"" start off at a measured pace and pick up steam, getting crazier and crazier and carrying us along as they send off hilarious little explosions, and no matter how bizarre they are they always make perfect insane sense.

I normally don't suggest viewing a film I heartily dislike, but watch ""Midnight"" and then ""Just Go With It"" and you'll get a blindingly clear picture of the decline of comedy in the movies since the 1930's.",1387497600,,1932,4.578034682080925
636347,5,6303382975,"What a gem this picture is.  It's amazing the film factories could turn something out this good (and off the wall).  I think Claudette Calvert really does her role justice.  I never cared for Don Ameche, but he is really at his best here.  And John Barrymore trying so hard not to steal scenes, but I guess he just couldn't help it.  Mary Astor plays the stuffy high society wife to perfection.  It doesn't hurt any that she has that carriage trade look.  I also thought the production values were right where they should have been.  The Paris street scenes really sparkle.",1387152000,,573,4.549019607843137

I fell in love with antics, the sharp and then slapstick humor, Jacques relentless seduction (""I eat husbands""), George's well-played scheme, and so much more. This film is a pure riot. My only criticism is that the whole thing ended too soon;.a sure sign that I had too much fun watching it.",1386979200,2,396,4.671428571428572
636349,5,6303382975,"I culled together critical comments from Amazon customers to articulate the special appeal of Midnight - a film for classic film fans to fall in love with and non-fans to get hooked by.  Ive selected comments in 3 top areas where Midnight continues to sparkle - the acting of Claudette Colbert, the direction of Mithcell Leisen, and the films overall Entertainment Value.

Concise Plot summary:

Claudette Colbert is essentially Cinderella in this clever twist on the Cinderella storyline. She's a penniless, but resourceful American in Paris, who through a few twists of fate, ends up impersonating a Hungarian Baroness, joining the upper echelons of society in the process. Her fairy godmother is John Barrymore.

1. Claudette Colbert Performance:

Colbert's performance is sheer perfection (in the realm of screwball heroines she is really without peer.

Colbert is the films major standout (how she missed an Academy Award nomination is beyond me), using her tongue as a weapon as big as her sultry stance. She is comic grace and beauty here.

2. Mitchell Leisens Direction:

Mitchell Leisen's stylish masterpiece benefits from Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett's brilliantly perceptive screenplay. 

Delicious stuff, and it is a credit to Leisen and the largely non-European cast that they pull the whole thing off so believably. In this film, at least, he manages a European elegance and sophistication that would have done Lubitsch proud.

3. Midnights Enduring Entertainment Value:

This classic of the Thirties is superior to most other comedies and a model of what a good romantic comedy should be. Take heed Hollywood.

Watching Midnight is like riding up a rainbow.  Pure shimmering wit and droll pleasures await, along with a head turning postmodern twist on the 'comedy of remarriage' that's eons ahead of its time.

I have a long shelf of romantic comedies--My Man Godfrey, Easy Living, Holiday, The Apartment, I Love You Again, Angel on my Shoulder, Palm Beach Story and plenty of contemporary movies--but if I could keep only one it would be Midnight.

It's a perfectly pitched romantic comedy, with a dream cast, witty script, terrific timing and one hilarious line or scene after another. It's got a sheen that holds up far better than many comedies of the same period.

The clock will never strike midnight for this legendary comedy!!

636353,5,6303382975,"Midnight is a very funny romantic comedy with some drama thrown in for a great effect! The acting was very convincing although I did notice that sometimes John Barrymore said his lines with a French accent and sometimes without a French accent; Barrymore was not a well man when this was filmed so I suppose this becomes a minor quibble. I loved those elaborate sets especially in the scenes at The Ritz Hotel and the Flammarion French estate! Moreover, the cinematography and the choreography reflect very careful forethought and the musical score, while not extensive since this is no musical, enhances the film as well.

When the action starts (and there's plenty of it) we quickly meet showgirl Eve Peabody (Claudette Colbert) who arrives by train one rainy night in Paris without so much as a plugged nickel to her name. Just by chance (I know; but this is Hollywood), she gets Tibor Czerny (Don Ameche), a taxi driver, to drive her from nightclub to nightclub all over Paris so she can find work; when she lands a job she'll give him a financial reward for his efforts. However, Tibor gets a little too friendly for Eve and she runs away when Tibor isn't looking! To avoid Tibor, Eve crashes a high society party given by Stephanie (Hedda Hopper). Georges Flammarion (John Barrymore), a worldly, quick-thinking man at the party married to Helene (Mary Astor), realizes that Eve is no Baroness. Nevertheless, Georges sets Eve up at The Ritz with a suite, a luxury car and a real chauffeur, clothing, a large expense account and everything so she can pose as a real Baroness and steal Helene's lover Jacques (Francis Lederer) so Helene will hopefully fall in love again with Georges. George still loves Helene very much and he thinks a good way to fight for her is to have the ""Baroness"" steal Jacques.

Of course, there's more to the plot than this. Tibor tries to find Eve; we also see what unexpectedly happens when Eve, posing as the Baroness, tries to lure Jacques away from Helene. I won't say much more so you can watch and enjoy this movie without spoilers; suffice it to say that the rest of the film shows how everything works out.

Look also for solid performances by Elaine Barrie as Simone; Rex O'Malley as Marcel, a friend of Georges and Helene and Armand Kaliz as a lawyer. Monty Woolley plays a judge and if you look closely you'll see Hedda Hopper's son William as a guest at a party given by the Flammarions.

Midnight is an excellent film for fans of the actors in it. In addition, people who appreciate classic romantic comedies with elements of drama will not be disappointed.",1367798400,2,2601,4.6849015317286655

636411,5,6303382975,"Screwball comedies rarely get better than Billy Wilder's 1939 delight, MIDNIGHT.  Claudette Colbert stars as modern-day Cinderella on a spree in Paris, who finds two princes with the help of her unlikely ""fairy godfather"".

Would-be chorine Eve Peabody (Claudette Colbert) arrives in Paris with little more than the clothes on her back and a Monte Carlo pawn-ticket.  Picked up by friendly cabby Tibor Czerny (Don Ameche), Eve finds a kindred spirit but resolves not to pursue a possible relationship with a man she's sure is as poor as the proverbial church-mouse.  Instead, Eve wanders into a high society soiree, where she encounters Georges Flammarion (John Barrymore), his wayward wife Helene (Mary Astor) and Jacques Picot (Francis Lederer), the lady-killer who is angling to split them apart.

Suddenly, Georges sees the perfect opportunity to offload Jacques.  When Eve successfully passes herself off as the ""Baroness Czerny"", Georges plays along when he notices Jacques falling for the mysterious new society belle.  Penniless Eve suddenly finds herself living in a big way, with a suite at the Ritz, a trunkload of new clothes and a steady flow of pocketmoney from Georges' bank!  All she has to do in return is keep Jacques' attention away from Helene.  Easier said than done...especially when cabby Tibor finally tracks down elusive Eve during a weekend at the Flammarions' country estate...

MIDNIGHT is yet another magical bauble from 1939, the year which has become synonymous with a slew of movie masterpieces.  This film fits in perfectly.  Claudette Colbert's performance is sheer perfection (in the realm of screwball heroines she is really without peer, except perhaps Irene Dunne's work in ""Theodora Goes Wild"" and ""The Awful Truth"").  MIDNIGHT also provided John Barrymore with what turned out to be one of his last great roles.  Looking far older than his 57 years, Barrymore passed away in 1942 at the age of 60.  Don Ameche and Francis Lederer, playing Colbert's dueling princes, are wonderful.  Mary Astor would again co-star with Ms Colbert in another highly-regarded screwball favourite, ""The Palm Beach Story"".

Lucky Claudette Colbert to have starred in not one but TWO of the great romantic screwball comedies (the other being the surprise 1934 smash ""It Happened One Night"" for Columbia).  Despite MIDNIGHT being a Paramount release, publicity for MIDNIGHT capatalized on Colbert's earlier hit by billing the film as ""It Happened One Night...at Midnight!"".

If you've yet to experience the sheer delight of MIDNIGHT, run (don't walk) to grab yourself a copy.  Highly-recommended!",1313625600,6,2612,5.278450363196126

Although most folks who watch it really like it, it was the film that made Wilder want to direct his own scripts, saying that if he couldn't do better than director Mitchell Leissen, well then... . So not only is it a wonderful film, but it prompted Wilder to write and direct some of the  masterpieces of American cinema henceforth.

Colbert is an American chanteuse run out of the Riviera for fortune-hunting to cold and rainy Paris where taxi driver Ameche literally and figuratively picks her up and decides to keep her. Although attracted to his macho sexuality, Colbert is looking for  that fortune and encounters fairy godmother Barrymore who finances her stay in Paris  in order to lure his own wife (Astor) back from an oily playboy (Francis Lederer). Amongst Astor trying to expose her, and Barrymore trying to promote her, and Ameche and Lederer who are both determined to marry her, the farce  is really amusing and absorbing.

636416,3,6303382975,"""Midnight"" is a romantic comedy that is often mistaken for a screwball comedy. It was written by the great Billy Wilder whose screenwriting credits include Oscar nominated ""Ninotchka"" (1939), ""Double Indemnity"" (1944), ""A Foreign Affair"" (1948), ""Witness for the Prosecution"" (1957), and ""Some Like it Hot"" (1959).

Charles Brackett was his writing partner on this film as well as 12 others including ""Ninotchka"", ""Hold Back the Dawn"" (1941), ""The Lost Weekend"" (1945), ""A Foreign Affair"" (1948), and ""Sunset Blvd"" (1950).

Mitchell Leisen directed. Known for his screwball comedies in the early 30s, Leisen worked primarily with leading ladies like Gene Tierney (""The Mating Season""), Olivia deHavilland (""To Each His Own"") , and Joan Fontaine (""Frenchman's Creek). He made several films with Claudette Colbert (""Arise My Love"" in 1940, ""No Time for Love"" in 1943, and ""Practically Yours"" in 1944). He often used Fred MacMurray as his co-star.

The cast is terrific, with such major 30s stars as Claudette Colbert, John Barrymore, Mary Astor, and Don Ameche with brief appearances by Hedda Hopper and Monty Woolley.

Claudette Colbert won the Oscar in 1934 for ""It Happened One Night"" and was nominated in 1936 (""Private Worlds"") and 1945 (""Since You Went Away""). In 1987 she won the Golden Globe for a TV show ""The Two Mrs. Grenvilles"", her last film. In her 50 years of performing, she made more than 50 films, though 35 of them were in the 30s and included such memorable films as ""Cleopatra"" (1934), ""Under Two Flags"" (1936), and ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" (1939).

John Barrymore was at the end of a long and distinguished career, now battling age and the effects of chronic alcoholism. After 1939 he would not make a good film, and he died in 1942. This is probably his last good performance, but to see a great performance, you need to go back to ""Romeo and Juliette"" (1936).

Don Ameche won his only Oscar at the age of 75 for ""Cocoon"" (1985). His film career was nearly 60 years long and included such films as ""The Three Musketeers"" (1939), ""Heaven can Wait"" (1945), and ""Trading Places"" (1983). Ameche is energetic, although he is absent from most of the first half of the film.

Mary Astor is best known as Bridgit O'Shaughnessy from ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941) and from her Oscar winning performance in ""The Great Lie"" (1941). Beginning in 1921 she appeared in more than 100 films. In the 1930s alone she made 44 films. She and Barrymore appeared together in several silent films and they had a brief affair, making the on screen antics ironic. Astor does a competent job as Barrymore's cheating wife.

Hedda Hopper has a brief role as a socialite. Hopper is better known for her gossip columns, but she did, in fact, appear in over 100 films between 1916 and 1946. Her performance in this film suggests that her career move was the correct one.

The great Monty Woolley appears as a judge. Best known as ""The Man Who Came to Dinner"" (1942), he was nominated twice for an Oscar, in 1943 (""The Pied Piper"") and in 1945 (""Since You Went Away"").

Charles Lang is the cinematographer. Lang was nominated more times for an Oscar than any other Director of Photography (18 times), but won only once - ""A Farewell to Arms"" (1934). The nearly 150 films he photographed differed in content and style, as Lang was an eclectic. He lensed such diverse films as ""Wait Until Dark"" (1967), ""How the West was Won"" (1962), ""Some Like it Hot"" (1959), ""The Big Heat"" (1953),""A Foreign Affair"" (1948), ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" (1947), and ""The Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" (1935). Lang's skills are clearly on exhibit in this film, although the cheap special effects and backgrounds don't work in his favor.

This is definitely an enjoyable film. Fast paced, funny in a wacky sort of way, with good performances from Colbert and Barrymore. I gave it a 3 on Amazon's 5-point scale, but if we had a 10-point scale it would get a 7.",1284508800,3,3919,4.7825443786982245

This fun and highly entertaining movie was made when movie makers knew how to tell a good story without being overtly graphic.

636467,5,6303382975,"Very much showering on me the joy I felt when watching one of Ernst Lubitsch's 30's comedies, director Mitchell Leisen's `Midnight' delivers on every front.  At times a tad preposterous (but forgivingly so), this film is delightful, complete with witty banter, stunning film structure and some of the most delightful performances in film that year (yes, 1939 was a banner year for film in general).

`Midnight' is one of the best of the year, easy.

Taking place in Paris, and starring the uber-sexy Claudette Colbert (one of my favorite actresses who ever breathed), `Midnight' tells the story of a `down on her luck' chorus girl named Eve who, in an attempt to escape falling in love with a poor taxi-driver, manages to weasel her way into a posh dinner party.  Instantly she is picked out as `out of place' by the wealthy George Flammarion.  Instead of outing her, George makes her a proposition.  She is to pretend to be the Baroness Czerny in attempt to persuade the dashing (and dastardly) Jacques Picot to leave Flammarion's wife alone.

She needs to seduce him.

All the while, the taxi-driver is in hot pursuit of Eve, knowing that he is in love with her (love at first sight is what got him), and when he finally finds her he poses a serious problem.

The film is littered with quick witted dialog that is marvelously delivered by the entire cast.  Colbert is the films major standout (how she missed an Academy Award nomination is beyond me), using her tongue as a weapon as big as her sultry stance.  She is comic grace and beauty here.  Don Ameche plays the love drunk taxi-driver Tibor with so much hot-headed affection you can't help but fall for him.  I loved John Barrymore's paternal comic flourishes, and Francis Lederer is the perfect `charming villain'.  Mary Astor is all sorts of phenomenal as the suspicious Helene Flammarion, and both Elaine Barrie and Hedda Hopper make deliciously entertaining supporting players.

The entire cast is a goldmine.

If you are looking for a comedy with class then look no further.  One of the best in the breed, `Midnight' (a title ripped from `Cinderella', which certainly plays a little influence here as well) is a surefire crowd pleaser that holds up today as one of the best comedies of all time.",1270425600,,2259,4.766066838046273
636468,5,6303382975,"This movie was at first reminiscent to me of ""Easy Living"" with Jean Arthur, in that all of a sudden a poor girl ends up being mistaken for being wealthy and eases into high society.  However, there are so many twists and turns in this plot, that I was at the edge of my seat.  Claudette Colbert, who is probably one of the most natural actresses ever, portrays an American who ends up penniless in Paris.  By chance she walks into an elite concert and is mistaken for a Baroness.  Seeing this as his opportunity to gain back the affection of his wandering wife, rather than unmasking her, this ultra well-to-do fellow encourages her in her charade and better yet, foots the bill!  However, the hard working poor guy is in the picture as well in the form of Don Ameche. And you'll have to watch the movie to figure out the ending.  But you won't regret the time spent on it!",1269129600,,874,4.364197530864198
636469,4,6303382975,"It's lauded as a classic these days, but I didn't much like Midnight the first time I viewed it.  Don't get me wrong - I'm obsessed with Claudette Colbert, and I thought she gave a great performance (but then again when doesn't she?).  I also thought the Charles Brackett/Billy Wilder screenplay was as sharply humorous as any of their others from the period, and Mitchell Leisen's directing as always delivered the requisite faux-Lubitsch I expected of him.  I didn't even mind John Barrymore quite obviously reading his hidden cue cards (notice how his bleary eyes roam about the set while he speaks, momentarily fixing on something - you can even see his eyes scan the dialog at certain points).  I just felt that the film's two plots didn't fully gel - I wanted the movie to either stick with the Ameche/Colbert romance or just play out the ""steal away the lover of Barrymore's wife"" bit to its full.

But on my second viewing it all fell together.  The budding Colbert/Ameche romance, the elaborate courtroom finale, even the way the movie ends a bit sooner than it should.  The film moves at a snappy pace, all one-liners and witty barbs and glamorous sets.  Colbert flits through the first half of the movie in a luminous evening gown which at times shines so bright it threatens to overwhelm the camera.  And the artificial Paris is exquisite.  I love the artifice of old movies.  Rather than shoot on location in Paris they'd just build a replica of the city on the studio lot.  Cynics today claim ""the sets look like sets"" but I say that's part of the charm of old films - the artificial worlds these characters inhabit only serve to heighten the fairy tale aspect of the movies themselves.

And Midnight is a 1939 fairy tale for sure, loosely based around Cinderella: Colbert is a fast-talking American without a red cent to her name, looking for a job in Paris.  Instead she meets and quickly falls for cab-driving Don Ameche.  Soon though she flees, not wanting to delve into another affair, and finds herself swept into the high society world of millionaire John Barrymore, who at length employs Colbert to pose as a Baroness.  Her mission is to seduce the wealthy man who cuckolds Barrymore, and she carries it out with aplomb.  This convoluted plot actually develops organically, and the movie rolls along full steam ahead.  It's entertaining throughout, not to mention hilarious.  And most importantly it rewards multiple viewings.

Those who enjoy this film are encouraged to seek out The Claudette Colbert boxset, which features her 1938 movie ""Bluebeard's Eighth Wife.""  This Ernst Lubitsch-directed, Gary Cooper-costarring film is very much along the lines of Midnight; it's even written by Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder, the same pair who wrote Midnight (as well as Colbert's 1940 ""Arise My Love,"" a movie yet to be released on DVD but one Colbert claimed was her favorite of her own films).  ""Bluebeard's Eighth Wife"" has for whatever reason been assailed over the decades while Midnight has been praised, but I actually prefer it - indeed, I'd say it's Colbert's best screwball comedy, even considering ""It Happened One Night.""

The DVD for Midnight includes the original trailer, which does a wonderful job conveying the film's ""Cinderella"" theme.  The movie's picture quality is mostly fine, if a bit grainy, but I've noticed that's pretty common in most classic film DVDs.  (Strange when you consider that most of these same films, when broadcast on cable network TCM, are noticeably free of grain.)",1260835200,3,3530,4.892436974789916
636470,5,6303382975,"I don't recall why I started out looking for old Don Ameche movies, but based on so many positive reviews here, this was the one I chose first.  I am so glad I did.  I've watched the DVD at least a dozen time since I received it, and I haven't tired of it.  I love the characters, the plot, the settings and costuming.

Colbert's Eve Peabody is beautiful, elegant, quick-thinking, and willing to take chances, whatever the consequences.  She yearns for financial security but somehow always winds up following her heart instead of her wallet (or clutch purse, in this case).  You can't help liking and sympathizing with her even when she seems determined to follow through on her gold-digging plan.  She quickly and successfully jumps into the role of faux baroness.

Ameche's Tibor Czerny is an honest, determined, non-materialistic cab driver of apparently simple tastes for whom the wealthy are just fares, not people to be envied, until he meets Eve and is utterly smitten with her.  She's smitten too, but tries to resist falling in love with yet another poor man, and flees into the lap of luxury.  But he'll do anything to find her again, even slide into the role of titled nobility himself.

Barrymore's George Flammarion is fabulous - he's hilarious, sly, and desperate to keep the wife he loves, whatever the cost, even to the extent of throwing a comely gold-digger in the path of his wife's lover in hopes of distracting him.  As complications arise, he seems to revel not just in having set the so-far successful plot in motion, but in being the only one who truly realizes what's going on and in going along with everything that happens as the situation gets more complicated and fantastic.

Astor's Helene Flammarion is very well-played, and her pain at seeing her lover's reaction to Eve seems very real.  She quickly realizes her rival will be successful if she doesn't do something, and she scrambles for some way to win the battle for Picot's heart; she's delighted to meet ""Baron Czerny"" and to set Czerny and Picot against each other in hopes that the baron will woo back his baroness and her lover will return to her.

Lederer's Jacques Picot, not often mentioned, is gorgeous and fun to watch, if rather predictable as not so much a villain but a light-hearted playboy whose fancy flits easily from one woman to another -- and you have to wonder about his often-referenced mother.  He's a man who needs women in his life, yet you see that none of them will really displace the mother who matters most to him -- until, perhaps, Eve.

The beginning build-up gives us time to get to know and care what happens between Peabody and Czerny, before they slip into the world of the refined wealthy who seem to have nothing better to do than host parties, go shopping, and play love games, with the poor couple looking for the real thing.  It's easy to just sit back, enjoy, laugh, and root for love.  Plenty of sly innuendo and sparkling wit, without the complications from vulgarity, violence, or love-defined-as-hopping-into-bed-at-first-meeting that have the potential to distract from characters, plot, and setting.  The cast plays so well off each other.  I enjoy them all.

Cynical and sharp with Billy Wilder involved in the script, the heroine is a really tough nut. Amazon have provided a great review so here a few personal comments:

- ensemble playing of this standard simply does not exist anymore
- Don Ameche plays with real edge in contrast to the insipid parts which 20th Centrury Fox saddled him with. He is virile and magnetic
- Claudette Colbert combines her tongue in cheek quality with a really hard edge which makes the heroine a fascinating creature
- John Barrymore, in spite of reading from prompt cards, is superb. His constant looks of bemusement and secret delight at the next flight of fantasy of Colbert are at the heart of the cynicism of the script
- the film has that glitter which signifies a Paramount product and the director Mitchell Liesen. The women are dressed magnificently
- Hedda Hopper, the famous gossip columninst, has an amusing part as a society dame
- the film is a great example of what could be achieved with a great script and players in spite of the Hays Code.

636588,5,6303382975,"Prefectly casted and hilariously funny, ""Midnight"" is a movie that will either have you curiously engaged or hysterically laughing the whole way through.
  The story begins with an American woman getting of a train in Paris with nothing but the gold evening gown on her back, a matching clutch bag, and no protection from the rain that pours down around her. She has no money, no other clothes, no job and no friends.
  She recieves kindness from a rather good looking cabby, who she says she will pay him double the cost of the venture if he takes her around town to look for night club jobs. The search ends fruitlessly, and she gives up in dispair. She says that they ought to part ways even though she has racked a horrible bill. He by now has taken a liking to her. And after buying her a cheap spageti dinner, says that she will spend night at his apartment because he is going to be out all night working any way. Knowing that she is falling in love with him,she runs out on him when his back is turned filling the cab with gas.
  The plot takes its twists and turns, while she gets paid to pretend to be a baroness with fancey clothes, a nice apartment, and plenty of spending cash. He, all the while, in his avid pusuit of her gathers his cabby buddies to find out where she ran off to.
  The storey ends in a hilariously rewarding manner. But don't think that I am going to ruin it for you!
  Despight it's lackluster title, ""Midnight"" is a movie worth watching even for those who aren't fond of the old classics.
  And I have to say, as good as it was, ""Midnight"" definantly outshines the great Frank Capra classic, ""It Happend One Night.",1209600000,5,1649,4.352941176470588

636592,5,6303382975,"MIDNIGHT is the greatest classic Hollywood comedy that almost no one has seen. Why this isn't better known is a bit of a mystery. The film is well directed, well scripted, well acted, and well produced. The film is directed by Mitchell Leisen, who has been unjustly forgotten for the misfortune of having directed a series of extremely fine films based on screenplays by two writers who would later become famous directors in their own right: Billy Wilder and Preston Sturges. But Leisen put his own distinctive touch on the films he directed, and that is nowhere truer than this superb film.

Nonetheless, the screenplay is superb, by one of the greatest writers of comedies in the history of cinema, Billy Wilder. Although he had been in Hollywood for a while, this was the first screenplay in which he truly hit his stride, the first in a series of stellar scripts (including NINOTCHKA for Lubitsch, ARISE MY LOVE and HOLD BACK THE DAWN for Leisen, and BALL OF FIRE for Howard Hawks) that led to his own shot at directing. Charles Brackett worked with Wilder as usual, Wilder functioning as the story originator and gagman, and Brackett cleaning up the Germanicisms cluttering Wilder's sentences. The cast is superb, with Claudette Colbert turning in one of her greatest performances as a young woman determined to capture a rich husband, but who instead inconveniently gets involved with a Parisian cab driver. Don Ameche was never better than in this film playing that Parisian cab driver. Mary Astor, who was extremely pregnant during filming, is her usual superb self, while the rest of the cast is littered with talented veteran character actors. The most bittersweet performance is the simultaneous hysterical and tragic performance by John Barrymore as a drunken dissipated nobleman. No question, the man turns in a funny, funny performance, but it is tragic because the appearance of drunkenness and dissipation was not the result of acting. Barrymore was suffering from advanced alcoholism during the filming, and was only a couple of years away from his premature death brought on by cirrhosis of the liver. The man once known as ""The Great Profile"" no longer was the extraordinarily handsome man he had been only five years earlier. He is funny, but it somehow seems unfitting that one of the great stage and screen actors of the 20th century should have ended his career as a bit of a buffoon.

The screenplay is if a kind that we no longer see, and was the result of a huge influx of European talent in the 1930s escaping the political situation in Europe. So many great films directed by Lubitsch and Wilder and others put an enormously European twist to love and romance, and in no film is this more true than this one: an adventurous woman trying to scale the social ladder by snaring a man, a gigolo seducing another man's wife, the husband scheming to reclaim his wife with the help of the would-be adventurous, and meanwhile a poor cabbie trying to find the woman he loves. Delicious stuff, and it is a credit to Leisen and the largely non-European cast that they pull the whole thing off so believably. In this film, at least, he manages a European elegance and sophistication that would have done Lubitsch proud.

This film is being co-released with two other films, all of them interestingly linked, MIDNIGHT and EASY LIVING.  Billy Wilder wrote the screenplay for MIDNIGHT and directed and wrote THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR.  Preston Sturges wrote EASY LIVING and in 1940 would direct his first film, THE GREAT MCGINTY.  Mitchell Leisen directed both MIDNIGHT and EASY LIVING.  During the late 1930s Leisen directed a string of great comedies, but almost all of them had been written by either Sturges or Wilder.  While THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR and MIDNIGHT represented the start of major directorial careers for Wilder and Sturges, the sudden lack of quality scripts signaled the end of Mitchell Leisen career as a great director.",1201996800,3,3952,4.8618127786032685
636622,5,6303382975,"Few comedies of the 1930's were better written and performed than ""Midnight"".

One of Mitchell Leisen's best directed films - mainly because Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett fought Leisen and forced him to not cut out any dialog (which he often did).

The premise; Claudette Colbert arrives in Paris by train with only an evening dress on her back.  How she weasels her way from the bottom to the top is the plot.

Also starring Don Ameche, John Barrymore (brilliant performance), Mary Astor, Francis Lederer, Hedda Hopper, Rex O'Malley, Monty Wooley, and Elaine Barrie....all very good.

Amazing sets and costumes.  Brilliant, snappy dialog.  I don't know if this is farly classified as 'Screwball"", but it's awfully funny.

John Barrymore, in the twilight of his career, was quoted as congratulating Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett for writing ""a screenplay with the quality of literary classic"".  Barrymore gives one of the very best performances of his sound-film career....on par with his brillant performance in 1934's 'Twentieth Century"".

Universal (who controls the pre-WWII Paramount catalog) has finally seen fit to put this one out on DVD.  Also in the release (April 22, 2008) are three other brilliant must-haves;

""The Major And The Minor"" (Billy Wilder's debut US directorial effort, starring Ginger Rogers and Ray Milland),

""Easy Living"" (Jean Arthur, Ray Milland and Edward Arnold shine in this brilliant screwball comedy written by Preston Sturges and directed by Michell Leisen),

636626,5,6303382975,"When Don Ameche sees Claudette Colbert standing on a Paris streetcorner at night, in her one item of quality, that gold lame gown, his brakes screech and he can't take his eyes off his new fare.  The gown, designed by Travis Banton in his last flurry of activity for Paramount, was Mitchell Leisen's idea-even in the lustrous black and white cinematography, its supple fabric, draped all over Colbert's showgirl body, shivers in the moonlight and actually looks gold, you could swear you saw a gold dress.  She's Eve Peabody-as in, It Started With Eve-an American singer down on her luck, but one with a charming attitude and optimism, the kind that helped the US out of the Depression.  She's rattling around Paris looking for her big break, or by now any kind of break at all.  There's a certain weariness about herb stance, brave as it is, a bone-tired cynicism that is constantly warring with her genuine good cheer.  Colbert's an amazing actress, or screen presence, and she can convey volumes of information with a single glance (and, as everyone had noticed), a single profile.

Her Adam-or really her Prince Charming-is the Hungarian cabbie played by Don Ameche in a rare venture away from 20th Century Fox for the popular comedian.  Ameche was a charming actor of indeterminate ethnic origin who was often asked to impersonate men from all over the globe.  It didn't matter, Ameche could play it.  He could even do all-American and thus was never seen as a threat to US hegemony.  When he gets together with French-born Colbert, it's supposed to be a hands across the water thing.  He's not French himself, but a refugee like so many pouring out of the East in those years, and Paris the laissez-faire city where individual freedoms are defended if only you have enough money and savoir-faire to afford them.  Could MIDNIGHT have been made in a US setting?  Possibly, but would many have warmed to a story of a French gold-digger out to marry a wealthy American?

John Barrymore, Mary Astor and Francis Lederer provide sterling support.  In some ways it's their surprise at all meeting up in the same movie; there's an effervescence about the casting alone that gives the film some of its champagne spritz.  With Colbert and Ameche kept apart by one thing alone-their poverty-they've got sex attraction to burn and each seems to complete the other's deracinated loneliness.  The glamour in MIDNIGHT is about nomadism, in the last gasp before the war, the last moment in which such a condition could seem attached to glamour.",1125014400,8,2533,4.8399071925754065
636627,5,6303382975,"I'm a man on a mission.  The NY Times has listed its ""1000 best movies ever made,"" and I've currently seen 273 of them but would like to see them all.  Therefore I've been scouring the DirecTV listings for those I haven't seen, and recently this film showed up, so I taped it and settled in to continue my education on the greatest old movies that I hadn't yet seen.

A synopsis of ""Midnight"" appears in several other excellent reviews on this page.  I agree that the title is somewhat unfortunate; a 1939 film called ""Midnight"" sounds like a film noir, and it's anything but.  While I'd say ""His Girl Friday"" is the best screwball comedy ever made, due to its breakneck pace from the opening credits to ""The End,"" ""Midnight"" eventually challenges for that title; it takes more time to really get rolling, so be patient with it and you'll receive a tremendous payoff.  Just when you think this down-and-out dancer has received too many good breaks to be believable, all is revealed and then starts to unravel in a most glorious way.  There's also one particular scene with John Barrymore & Don Ameche on the phone with each other that ranks as one of the four or five funniest things I have ever seen in my life.

Ultimately I'd like to rate ""Midnight"" at 4-1/2 stars, partly because of how long it takes to really hit its stride and partly because the chemistry been Ameche and Claudette Colbert isn't nearly as obvious as it was between her and Clark Gable in the more famous ""It Happened One Night.""  Ultimately, however, these are really nitpicks.  ""Midnight"" compares favorably with any farcical product from Hollywood's golden age, including the aforementioned films and such classics as ""Bringing Up Baby.""  I'd like to publicly thank the NY Times for recommending it to me, and I'm passing on the favor by recommending it to you.",1110844800,7,1837,4.673913043478261

This should be an essential for any fan of classic screwball comedies. I think the innocuous name, ""Midnight,"" makes it easy to overlook and perhaps difficult to find.

Colbert is obviously in her element here, as an unpretentious, down-on-her luck American in Hollywood's Paris who transforms into the ""Baroness Czerny"" and cons the Parisian elite. Don Ameche plays the Hungarian taxi driver (who sounds like he's from Pittsburgh) who pursues her. All of the characters are superb, and the script is one of the best. John Barrymore is hysterical as the kindly husband trying to win back his wife. The scene over the phone when he's imitating the baby is priceless.

Made in 1939 along with ""Gone with the Wind"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"", it shows a peek of the clothes, cars, homes, lifestyle, and more from that period. Wonderful cast even down to the Judge played by Monty Wooley. Claudette Colbert, Don Ameche, Mary Astor, and John Barrymore give great performances and are well complimented by the rest the cast. If you enjoy classic comedies like ""The Man Who Came to Dinner"" and ""It Happened One Night"" you will certainly enjoy this one. A fun romantic comedy that is easy to relax and enjoy with the family.

 When Colbert decides a Parisian taxi driver played by Ameche is the right type for her but doesn't have enough money, she sets her sights on a wealthy suitor. When it turns out he is married but actually wants her to see someone seeing his wife, the fun really begins. She pretends to be a Countess from Hungary and when Ameche shows up as her husband, she really has to work to carry off her charade. This had to be racy for the time it was made. It is full of life and lovingly made. The cast really seem to be having fun with their roles because you see some hamming from time to time.

Claudette Colbert is wisecracking chorus girl Eve Peabody (later Baroness Czerny), stranded in Paris, who is befriended by taxi driver Tibor Czerny (played by Don Ameche, in one of his best roles) and ends rubbing elbows with the ""smart-set"", with unexpected results. For those who have watched Anatole Litvak's ""Tovarich"" (1937) on TCM, starring Colbert and Charles Boyer, it has a similar premise, but the other way round, because in the latter Colbert, a Russian Grand Duchess who belongs to that country's Royal Family, pretends to be a maid.
The cast is full of excellent players: John Barrymore who impersonates with great skill, Monsieur Flammarion, a role somehow reminiscent of the one he played in ""Twentieth Century"" opposite Carole Lombard, but in a much ""understated"" manner. Mary Astor, as his unfaithful wife is rightly ""stiff-upper-lip"", high class and disdainful. Francis Lederer is very good as her lover, Jacques Picot, who falls under the spell of Colbert's charms. Rex O'Malley is Astor's wisecracking friend, Marcel Renard.
This movie has definitely the trademark ""Paramount Look"" and the great settings recreate Paris very well.

Hopper was originally an actress who began playing in silents in the twenties (she and Barrymore had a fling back then). Mary Astor and Barrymore also had a passionate love affair in the twenties, but by this time Barrymore was a sickly, old man (for 57, due to his alcoholism) who sheepishly warned Astor that Elaine Barry was very jealous - Astor later wrote that there was no reminiscing on the set!",996537600,4,1459,5.008230452674897
636697,5,6303382975,"Directed by Mitchell Leisen(unjustly forgotten helmer of many wonderful  ""golden age"" films-and former designer for DeMille),written by  Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett at their wittiest, and starring Claudette  Colbert, Don Ameche, Mary Astor and an incomparable John Barrymore-well,  it's even better than it sounds.  Beautifully polished and mounted  production.  Definitely a very adult ""screwball"" comedy with  loads of innuendo, brilliantly played.  I've seen this both on TV and in a  theatre, and judging from audience reaction, every one of them loved it.  This is one of those titles you can show to people who've usually little  interest in ""old"" movies-and convert them!",964569600,67,684,5.598039215686274
636698,5,6303382975,"Claudette Colbert and Don Ameche are truly electric in this effervescent romantic comedy.  Colbert perfectly portrays the sweet and zany heroine while Ameche holds his own as the dashing but goofy hero.  Fans of John  Barrymore will love this film which is the perfect vehicle for his classic  idiosyncrasies.  Great screenplay, actors, and directing make this an  absolute must-buy.",950486400,3,383,5.406779661016949

7845116,3,6303382975,Caudette Colbert's comdey timeing exhibiting ability to laugh at herself at the same time. However her chemistry with the cast is not as appealing as she usually has with most of her leading men. My partner felt it had a drag in its pace with not much substance. It's not a must see.,1521417600,,283,4.3584905660377355
