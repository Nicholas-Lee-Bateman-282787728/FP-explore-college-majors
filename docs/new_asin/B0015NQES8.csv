8259288,3,B0015NQES8,"Any review of this one hour documentary needs to stress that its topic is not U-boats, contrary to the title, but the whole Kriegsmarine. As a result of the documentarys short length, in combination with the too broad coverage of its topic, it unfortunately provides very rudimentary coverage of its topic. For anyone over the newbie the video really does not present anything of interest in terms of facts of analysis. However, the documentary does provide some footage that would be of interest. This footage seems to be from German propaganda films as opposed to from Kriegsmarine archives. Thus it looks impressive but probably does not show anything that those with an intermediate and above level of knowledge have not seen elsewhere. Thus for those with an intermediate or higher knowledge level this documentary would rate a 2 star.

For the newbie, however, this documentary does have some value, despite its very short and rudimentary nature. One important fact this documentary makes is that the German capital ships did not play much of a role (with the notable exception of tying down significant allied resources). It also makes the point that the main contribution made by the Kriegsmarine to the German war effort was made by its smaller vessels. This included not only the U-boats but also the wide variety and large number of other smaller vessels such as minesweepers, s-boats, etc. It also makes clear that the Kriegsmarine was relatively low on the totem pole in terms of resource priority.

With respect to weaknesses, for the newbie, unfortunately there are (too) many. These take the form of absences of analysis and discussion. This, in turn, is due to the very short length of the documentary. Little is discussed in terms of the technological race that was so important to the defeat of the U-boats. There is no discussion of later U-boats that were revolutionary in nature (i.e., type 21) or of the role of enigma. There is little high level discussion and analysis, on a year by year basis, of how the naval war progressed. Hence, despite the documentaries positive attributes (again only for the newbies) the documentary also has weaknesses.

Thus this DVD is deserving of only a three star rating. Not a bad expenditure of one hour of ones time but nothing particularly enlightening either.

For those interested in a better documentary series on the topic, this reviewer recommends threeone hour documentaries, the ""Grey Wolves"" ,part of the war archives collection. Each of these covers a, roughly, 2 year period of the war. These have the advantage of being geared towards the U-boat arm of the Kriegsmarine exclusively, have a more serious analysis that would be of interest to beginners and the intermediary, as opposed to specialists, (albeit it is in a monotone British accent) and have better film footage. The film footage, like in ""U-Boat wars"", is primarily if not exclusively from German WWII propaganda 16mm newsreels and hence a good deal of it is not realistic combat footage (i.e., flotillas operating together in the open seas) albeit it still looks quite impressive.",1429401600,2,3115,5.019342359767892
8259289,1,B0015NQES8,A very light weight look at the U-Boat war. They tried to jam too much information into the amount of space they had. I will not be purchasing any other of the books in this series.,1304640000,,181,4.055555555555555
8259290,5,B0015NQES8,Great video with good photos from WWII. There are pictures never shown to anyone outside of Germany before. It tells the great story of the mighty u-boats destroying british shipping in the north atlantic. Alot of detail was but in the video. Great buy if you are into German submarines.,1249084800,3,287,4.76
