7756254,5,B01G719XAS,"Every few month the mostly classical home video label releases a newly retrieved rarity from the so-called Golden Age of Television when most of the nighttime programming was performed live. Weve had the pleasure of TWO versions of Peter Pan with Mary Martin, One Touch of Venus (with Janet Blair, and Sigmund Rombergs The Desert Song with Nelson Eddy, among others. This is the latest. Its another one of Producer Max Liebmans TV spectaculars. (In fact is was the second in the series of COLOR broadcasts in 1954.). But, in 1954, there was not video tape. Any permanent record of TV shows was on Black and white film. (Thats why we have the Honeymooners and I Love Lucy shows to enjoy. They were FILMED. NBC would make a record of their live shows by making a Kinescope of the performance. This was a black and white film of what appeared on the TV monitor. So, even though that small minority of Americans who had a color TV set in 1954 were able to see the gorgeous costumes in living color, all we have left is the black and white kinescope. And don't expect high-def images. There are some dark scenes and a few minor pieces of dust on the image that could not be cleaned up.

Im making you aware of this up front but these shortcomings won't matter to musical theater lovers. Its all about the music. The show is about a fashion magazine editor who is all work and no play, who visits a psychiatrist to help her. During these sessions she dreams of wonderful times and love. The technique that playwright Moss Hart, along with composer Kurt Weill and lyricist Ira Gershwin used to tell the story has all the dialogue SPOKEN when we are in the real world and all the dreams are filled with music and dance. The show premiered on Broadway in 1941 and was later done on radio and in a motion picture. The script was edited down to just 79 minutes for TV (there were 11 minutes of commercials in the 90 minute show, which aired on a Sunday Evening on NBC). The music and dance numbers were left virtually intact.

The show only had two songs that you might remember. The biggest hit was My Ship. I have my own issue with this song because it appears in the background near the beginning and continues to reappear throughout the show until the vocal version arrives near the end. Its a personal thing with me, but I find it annoying. Im sure others will see differently. The other song is the novelty Tchaikovsky (in which the character, Russell (Carleton Carpenter) rattles off a list of Russian composers at lightning speed. Danny Kaye was in the original cast and this was a trademark number throughout his career.

The lead role is played by Ann Sothern, who shows she can act and dance. Personally I was not impressed by her singing voice and I found myself getting bored with her vocal numbers. Others, Im sure, will disagree.

The show was performed in front of a LIVE audience in the studio  and, because this was live TV, they couldn't do it over. So youll periodically hear a piece of scenery be moved or an audience member snickering at a line of dialogue. It gives the production a reall feeling.
The DVD has the Oldsmobile commercials excised. (In prior releases the excised commercials were offered as bonus features. This time the only bonus is a three-minute Introduction and Closing

This time around VAI has included a terrific 2 page insert containing an essay on the history of the show  by Bruce D. McClung who authored a full book on the musical. It really adds to the enjoyment of this package.

I cant help but think that  if a show like this were to air today, it would be on PBS (as a Great Performance episode). This would be way to sophisticated for modern network TV audiences. I was lucky enough be alive during the 1950s to see these shows live (though not in color even then. This is part of our culture

If you are a fan of American Musical Theater (or even early TV broadcasting), youll want this newest release. The print came from the Library of Congress and I cant wait to see whats next.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8762443,5,B01G719XAS,"This is a wonderful, beautiful BLAST from the past. It makes me glad that I am old enough to have seen shows such as this. It is proof once again that TV was better in it's infancy than it is today. This disc is not in color as it was originally telecast back in 1954. Color television was just starting out and very few shows were in color.  Max Liebman a great showman of the day would produce and direct a color special about every month in the 50's. And to chose such a sophisticated  Broadway show as ""Lady In The Dark"" was probably very risky at the time.  The Paramount motion picture version starring Ginger Rogers in the 40's was a disappointment. Mainly because they took out most of the musical numbers from the original B'way show. Even ""My Ship"" ! Now how stupid was that ! Ginger looked beautiful in the film and it was a chance for her to carry a musical by herself, without Fred Astaire or anyone else. But they ruined it for her.
But Ann Souther who was a very popular TV star at the time was chosen for the lead as Liza Elliott and Ann did a sensational job. Her singing voice should have been used more often on other projects.
Warning: this is a old show and it shows because of the quality at the time and maybe not as clear as you may wish for and it is in black & white, but none of that should matter for REAL nostalgia buffs. The book is by Moss Hart and the music is by Ira Gershwin and Kurt Weill.
Carleton Carpenter almost steals the show in every scene he's in. Remember Carleton from singing ""Aba Dabba Honemoon"" and ""Row, Row. Row"" with Debbie Reynolds ?  The production numbers are done beautifully. It almost reminds you of those glorious MGM musicals.
I believe that most of the 'good old TV has been destroyed through the years, so this is a treasure. Paul Newman once said that he learned much of his craft through his television work like ""Playhouse 90"" and ""Westinghouse Presents"" and ""Kraft Theatre"" and such shows.
The problem with a show like ""Lady In The Dark"" is that it reminds you of the actual poor quality of drama and TV productions that we have TODAY. Anyway I suggest getting this great musical and see for yourself how great television shows used to be in The Golden Age of Television.",1497312000,5,2236,4.342105263157895

8762446,3,B01G719XAS,"I must continue my fight against rhe orchestral re-arrangements. Here's a 'name' of yesterday Broadway - Irwin Kostal - who beautifully signed the orchestrations of several important B'way musicals, but why a musician like him put himself in competition with the original orchestrations of a composer such as Kurt Weill? Too bad.  For me, it's an outrageous act. It happened many years ago with this  tv product, but - hlas! - it also and often happens nowadays with revivals on B'way: the sound is new, not better, but discouraging and also disgustingly irreverent.
I was happy when recently I bought the dvd of Kern's SHOW BOAT where it was evidently shown the name of Robert Russell Bennett, the original musician who magnificently orchestrated the Music con la elle maiuscola of Jerome Kern. John McGill has conducted old musicals with perfect rendition, style and respect for the original sound. Am I right?
Let me also add that here Ann Sothern isn't that lady of the title: I believe she has no force to lead the role - she's too hollywoodish, too honey, too child, too unreal. Wouldn't it be a dream to see LADY IN THE DARK at the londonese Royal Opera House? We have enjoyed Weill's STREET SCENE on different opera house stages, so ...
why not LADY IN THE DARK?
Friendly yours, Ernesto",1481587200,,1294,4.772321428571429
