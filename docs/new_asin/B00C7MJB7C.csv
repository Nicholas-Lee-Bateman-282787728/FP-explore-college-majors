5696237,4,B00C7MJB7C,"A good compilation of episodes of ""The Virginian"" from across the years. However this is not a ""best of"" collection as the episodes have been mainly picked because of the notable guest stars featured. They range from "" A Small Taste of Justice"" one of the finest episodes to "" A Killer In Town"" a boring episode with no action. I was never comfortable with the episodes in which James Drury does not appear and there are a few here. However I understand why this occurred because of the heavy work schedule. Nevertheless ""The Virginian"" is still my favourite TV western and one I always regarded as the thinking man's western. This is a good box set to purchase, even though it is not the cream of the series.",1441756800,11,709,4.503875968992248

5696240,5,B00C7MJB7C,"Can I give it 8 stars? This comes from the day when TV was TV...quality, sincerity, complexity, decency and always a moral lesson! I remember my grandparents watching ""The Virginian"" when I was a little boy and my grandmother commenting on it years after it ended; complimenting the actors and story lines. I now join her in that applause. Let's not forget Lee J. Cobb; he did a lot here to establish this masterpiece. I love the show and will undoubtedly buy the full series from Amazon.",1426550400,5,488,4.620689655172414
