3726749,4,B001O49STU,"Compelling information, good talking head documentary. The format is choppy, and could have a more developed story line. Hopeful and upbeat, with good examples of how the standard american diet degrades our population and environment, and how the change to a plant-based diet creates sustainability, and health.",1325376000,3,311,5.638297872340425
3726750,3,B001O49STU,"I give kudos to the filmmakers for making another documentary about nutrition.  People who 'heavily consume' educational, testimonial type documentaries may think it's a bit tired though.

I say that because I'm that kind of person; the documentary does not present anything new to me, so it was hard for me to watch.  It is rudimentary information that a person interested in and keeping current with the dialogue of the following should already know: nutrition and diseases of civilization; IBS; syndrome X / pre-diabetic insulin-resistance; gluten-free, Atkins, South Beach, Paleo, Bloodtype / Alkaline, Vegan, Vegetarian, name-your-modern-trendy-diet; Cultivated foods; Exercise versus Diet etc

I believe the documentary is thin on facts but heavy on testimonials of health care workers.  Given it is only 40 minutes long, lends credence to a motto I've been developing recently: 'simplicity is suspect'.  This world in which we live is staggeringly complex, and to reduce it down to binary thinking without presenting a overwhelming force of facts is... kind of lame.

--
Did not like the comparison of turn of the century people being healthier than modern people.  We have more people (larger sample size or population), better diagnostic equipment, and a culture of attention-to-health which ancient people didn't have.  They got dysentery, then they died.  I bet they weren't counted among the 2% of people with diseases, because they were dead, so technically they weren't people they were corpses.  You think that's funny but that's how bean counting works.  Statistics are skewed to say what they want and people are funny with numbers.

--

Also, I wasn't a big fan of the direction's choice of including heavy-handed vegetable-based diet versus meat that didn't necessarily make the point beyond ""people get healthier when they stop eating meat"" or ""our children are bombarded by fast food commercials but there are no commercials for fresh fruits"". I'm not saying that is incorrect, I agree with it but I don't think they made their argument very well.

Mcdonalds has a lot more money to spend on a national campaign than an almond farmer or grape farmer in america, especially since the big agribusiness companies are operating on thin margins, subsidies coupled with a drive to completely change their methodoligies to large-scale organic farming because it's what the market demands now.  But read that last sentence again, clearly people who are still eating at mcdonalds aren't the same ones who are causing this demand are they?  Where in this documentary does it talk about this?",1317254400,7,2602,5.231325301204819
3726751,3,B001O49STU,"The information provided from the physicians and registered dieticians who were interviewed is very important - especially when they link the actual outcome of changing your life habits - what you eat and how active you are; with the conditions that some of their patients presented with.  The information about how our medical, fast food and health industries has changed in the last 50 years, as our nation as a whole has become wealthier was very interesting, showing how they all serve to support your poor health.  You are encouraged to empower yourself, learn more about the foods you eat, how it's processed and learn how wonderful fruits and vegetables are to your body's health.  People are encouraged to exercise every day, and my personal opinion is that people would like to - it's our work and family schedules which are sometimes quite hectic that prevent us from doing so.  Unfortunately there is no 'answer' for that - one has to determine for oneself where you will find the time to do so - even if it's as simple as going for a walk.  This documentary DVD is dated 2009 and it looks like it was done with a powerpoint presentation, the graphics/photos are not appealing, they are static and don't do anything to enhance the information being presented.  In this day and age, it's quite poorly executed, which is why I took off 2 stars.",1310256000,24,1353,4.711864406779661
3726752,5,B001O49STU,A informative documentary. Well done and with some humor too. Anyone who eats fast food needs to see this. Show it to your kids. A favorite in my library of films. What else can I say.,1280275200,10,184,4.138888888888889
3726753,5,B001O49STU,"Processed people explains what's going on with the diet of people, especially americans, which consume excessively low-nutrient and high-fat, high-sugar, high-calories food also known as ""junk food"". This diet is so bad that it has been causing a obesity epidemic, diabetes and other diseases. And also total lack of exercises, or physical activity and decent food, like vegetables, fruits and grains. These people are also affected by processed news and processed information, thus making them ""Processed people"".

The movie, like many documentaries, is a collection of opinions of experts on the subject, who have very valuable and enlightening information dealing with health. In general, that's the focus of the documentary: health.

It also deals with the ""disease care"" instead of health care, because its only concern is to provide a pill to a disease instead of proper information and prevention. Animal-based products like meat and milk are also discussed and how it affects us and our planet.

I believe that this documentary can save many lives, including yours, if you watch it. Very recommended.",1270512000,12,1108,5.35632183908046
3726754,5,B001O49STU,The actual movie isn't very long but you can get a lot more information in the special features section when they interview each of the doctors. it takes a bit of time but is well worth it and is very knowledgeable. I think that the movie would be better for new people looking into the subject if they didn't have to go to the special features to get most of the knowledge.,1257897600,25,374,4.208333333333333
3726755,5,B001O49STU,"If you want to save your own life, or at least make yourself healthier and probably get off the myriad of pills you are taking for all your ailments - heart disease, cancer, diabetes, MS...watch this video. All of it - extended interviews and all. It takes some time, but I watched it in a about 3 sittings. No more animal based products for me. And then get on [...] and order a dvd called ""Eating"" and then get on [...] and order his 2008 video. I saw him last week in person - the man read 7,000 scientific articles dealing with nutrition last year! Use all of the information you find to save your own life and those of your loved ones. Because the government and the meat/dairy industry are definitely not looking out for you! Dr. John MacDougall's books are available on amazon.com. The two cookbooks he did with his wife are full of good recipes that contain NO animal products (NO, I'm NOT with PETA!). Also good is a cookbook called ""Skinny Bitch in the Kitch""; a little vulgar, but full of good/great recipes. If we all ate like this video recommends, we'd find our own solution to the cost of healthcare in this nation - it's called good nutrition, a healthy life and very little sickness. Good Luck.",1238371200,78,1211,4.45945945945946
3726756,5,B001O49STU,"This documentary is a `wake-up' call with factual, hard-hitting commentary that is rarely heard when it comes to our typical American diet and lifestyle.  While we have unprecedented access to information, food choices and medical treatment options, our health outcomes remain dismal.  We're both overfed and undernourished.

Yet, `Processed People' provides a message of real hope for all Americans - especially the overweight and chronically ill.  An impressive group of courageous physicians and health experts speak out about the dietary and lifestyle changes necessary to achieve optimal health.  This fast-moving, professionally produced, 40-minute documentary also includes over 2 hours of extended interviews with health professionals who share their personal journeys to well-being and their unique perspectives on America's ""health care"" system.  If you're searching for the un-processed truth about diet and health, look no further.",1232236800,18,943,5.948148148148148

3726787,5,B001O49STU,"American documentary about the state of the food consumption in the US and the rising rate of obesity, having said that the principles and messages apply to all of us anywhere in the world.

3726790,5,B001O49STU,I bought this to show my student's.  I found it to be a true and disturbing commentary on the current condition of Americans.

3726792,2,B001O49STU,"I was so disappointed with this DVD. It featured all of my heros - John McDougall, John Robbins, Joel Furhman and Dr Esselstyn, but the program was so choppy - I kept wondering when the intro would be over and the program begin. Admittedly, I've been following these folks for years, but I did expect some aha! moment. If it wasn't for the individual interviews at the end, this DVD wouldn't even have rated one star. I would definately recommend Dr McDougall's lecture series instead. Now there's content!",1347926400,9,506,4.761363636363637
3726793,1,B001O49STU,"Yes, I agree,  we have an obesity epidemic.  And yes, we have another answer that will only add to the problem.  The mantra of the DVD is eliminate all animal products, all fats and consume only grains, vegetables and fruits.  The authors have apparently never read about insulin resistance, diabetes, or lectins, phytates, etc. They need to go back to school - hopefully were Dr. L. Cordain teaches.  Don't waste your money on this.",1343779200,3,433,4.797297297297297
3726794,4,B001O49STU,This documentary is very informative.  It features a variety of qualified health professionals to discuss each health topic.  You are able to shorten it into smaller segments for shorter time periods and still not miss any of its important emphasis on the hazards of processed foods.,1337817600,2,283,5.130434782608695
3726795,1,B001O49STU,The theme of this video is that Americans are suffering health issues due to eating processed food and the way to combat that is by eating a whole foods plant based diet. I agree 100%.  The problem with this video is that it doesn't say much more than just that simple general statement.  Almost no details of how processed foods hurt your health nor any details about what to do are given.  This video is only 40 minutes long and does little more than repeat variations of the general statement described.,1334534400,9,506,4.538461538461538
3726796,3,B001O49STU,"I'll admit right off that I did learn quite a bit from this video about the food or ""food"" I eat. One of my favorite lines from this movie is, ""Eat food. Don't eat food-like things."" However, I heard a lot of ideas that just seemed downright silly. First and foremost is their pushing of a vegan diet. Humans are NOT herbivores, we never have been and we are not designed to be. As Neanderthals, we ate meat out of necessity because it gave us the intense amount of protein we needed to survive. We evolved with four sharp canine teeth as a result. As far as eliminating other animal products such as eggs, milk, cheese, and butter, we would be eliminating massive amounts of calcium from our diet. Yes, green leafy vegetables have calcium as does tofu and calcium-enriched soy milk. The tricky part about the last two is that they're made from soy, which 9 times out of 10 are manufactured by Monsanto and are thus genetically modified to resist and possibly even produce RoundUp, a highly toxic herbicide.

Overall, I feel like I'm watching a video made and sponsored by PETA. Perhaps I am. I found it hard to swallow as a whole but bits and pieces made sense to me, such as the aforementioned quote as well as the various doctors and nurses pushing that if we don't make the time now, despite our busy schedules, to eat right and get exercise, then our time will be taken up at a later date in hospitals and doctor's offices trying to either save our lives or cure our obesity-onset illnesses.",1329955200,4,1496,4.47985347985348

8329279,5,B001O49STU,"Really good documentary, I love the passion. Only thing I don't agree with is that meat and fats are automatically bad for health. It depends on the source and whether it's been processed or not. It is the PROCESSED FOOD that is dangerous, not meat necessarily.",1488499200,,261,4.695652173913044
8329280,5,B001O49STU,"What most people do not know is digestion and more importantly, nutrient assimilation takes place in the GI tract and not the stomach. The GI tract has good bacteria or flora as some put it.  But when you eat processed foods, you are ingesting preservatives.  What is the primary goal of food preservatives? To inhibit and kill bacteria. What happens to your GI Tract Flora when you constantly eat on a daily basis food preservatives? The Good Bacteria or Flora is diminished, making it far more difficult to assimilate the nutrients in your food or supplements.  Additionally, if you are consuming animal proteins without the proper digestive bacteria, the correlation to many dietary diseases is greatly enhanced. So watch the movie, and then start buying ingredients, not processed foods.",1479772800,,791,5.116279069767442
