8431192,5,B004ISVH9I,"I really liked this documentary.  I am a science teacher and I show the videos to my middle school classes when they learn about adaptations.  It's great in showing various physical traits and how they really help animals in their survival.  My students LOVE seeing the slow-motion clips of the predators catching their prey (the ""moment of impact"").  This DVD/Blu Ray combo contains BOTH parts of the documentary: Pt. 1 - Hunters & Herds and Pt. 2 - Jungle.  My personal favorite is the Jungle documentary, but both are good.  If you are unsure whether or not this documentary is for you, check out the PBS Nature website because they have clips (and may still have the whole Part 1 episode) available to stream and give you an idea how the documentary is set up.",1427932800,2,764,4.622222222222222
8431193,3,B004ISVH9I,"Predators Moment Of Impact, had a negative impact on my feelings about this film. This documentary was somewhat boring, with too much difficult scientific-like concepts, of how predators catch prey. It relied on, and used too much under the skin  bio-digital, interactive 3D visuals, to make their point. The mistake they make is constantly switching from the live action of the documentary, to the still-frame, digital 3D graphics too many times. It became too scientific, and I could not understand why this unimportant information, would be considered important to anyone.

When I purchased this documentary, I did not expect there would be so much analysis, interruptions, and interferences. I thought I would be watching animals in their natural environments, running away to evade predators. The average viewer like me, probably does not care to see 3D graphics, or cartoon-like visuals, to see the muscle structures a predator uses to subdue quarry. It makes things too technical, and the documentary is not that enjoyable. The muscle groups that a predator uses that's shown in 3D, takes away from the real-time moment of impact, that this documentary is supposed to be about. They used an endless amount of repetitive film, showing an eagle chasing a rabbit, and they replayed the film numerous times, to show which muscles the rabbit used, and which muscles the eagle used during the pursuit. This film is definitely not what I thought it would be, and I don't bother to watch this anymore.",1363910400,7,1500,5.09349593495935
