5920735,5,B00EIXWMII,My condolences but the show must go on. Too much chemistry and talent to just stop making this wonderful series!!!!,1391385600,4,115,4.8
5920736,5,B00EIXWMII,"Am a flight attendant, and had the great pleasure of having Angie Harmon on a red-eye flight...Fans of the show please know that as sweet and wonderful as her character 'Jane Rizzoli' is on the show she is just as warm and unbelievably friendly...Of course I love the show and the chemistry between she and Sasha...great...my husband and I never miss it...We look forward to many more years of their 'let's find out who done it and kick some keister ' attitude...Brava  Ladies.",1387756800,42,477,4.746987951807229
5920737,5,B00EIXWMII,I can't watch TV so I've really enjoyed having the DVDs of the series. I hope there are more coming.,1386720000,,100,4.05
5920738,5,B00EIXWMII,"Rizzoli and Isles is a great combination of crime drama, comedy and the complexity of relationships - whether with family, friends or coworkers.  Awesome show.",1385164800,11,159,5.36
5920739,5,B00EIXWMII,"When they shot and killed Kate (Sasha Alexander) in NCIS, I was so upset. WELL! Looks like it was a blessing in disguise. She is awesome in Rizzoli and Isles. The chemistry. Between her and Angie Harmon is absolutely wonderful.",1383004800,4,227,4.7
5920740,5,B00EIXWMII,It's so nice to be able to watch the complete series without commercials.  Amazon is so great when buying the complete series of a tv show.  You can preorder the next season and they sell it to you at the price when it comes out which is usually lower than when you pre-order it.,1381363200,4,279,4.148148148148148
5920741,5,B00EIXWMII,I love the imaginative cover art for the Rizzoli & Isles DVDs.  I look forward to the release of each season to see how they topped the previous cover.  This show is one of my favorites and these fun DVD covers just add to the enjoyment of the episodes!,1377561600,4,253,4.142857142857143
5920742,5,B00EIXWMII,"""Rizzoli & Isles"" returns for its fourth season on TNT with its principal cast intact and a whole new set of excellent episodes set in the Boston Police Department.  Angie Harmon is street-wise detective Jane Rizzoli; Sasha Alexander is her best friend, medical examiner Maura Isles.  Bruce McGill and Lee Thompson Young are Jane's fellow Homicide Division squad mates Vince Korsak and Barry Frost.  Lorraine Bracco is Jane's mother Angela.

When we last saw them at the end of Season Three, Jane and Maura were leading the rescue effort to get Jane's brother Tommy, his baby son TJ, and Detective Frost out of a collapsed parking garage.  In the new season, the crew deals with the aftermath of that traumatic incident.  Jane's injured soldier boyfriend will elect risky spinal surgery; Maura will struggle to build a relationship with her newly discovered mother and step-sister.  The trial of Maura's mobster father Paddy Doyle will hang over the season, placing strains on Jane and Maura.  Jane's brother Frankie finally gets his detective shield, putting him at odds with Jane at more crime scenes.

The episodes combine tense police procedural with moving and sometime hilarious family drama.  Jane and Maura will have difficult cases to solve, including one in which Maura is framed for murder and another in which Jane has to work with an old boyfriend she no longer trusts.  The christening of Tommy's TJ turns into a social disaster, with TJ's mother threatening to take the child out of state and away from Jane's family.  The end result will be superb entertainment.  The heart of the show continues to be the wonderful friendship between Jane and Maura.  Recommended.  And Rizzoli & Isles has already been renewed for Season Five.",1376870400,68,1743,5.003472222222222
5920743,5,B00EIXWMII,"I own every episode. This is a buy item, no rent, good enough to watch several times over. Finally a US cop show on the level of all the great Brit stuff. Hope it runs for a decade. Tess Garritsen is the novel author behind the beginning of ""Rozzoli & Isles"" as well as credited for writing the series. Jane Tamaro is producer and writer of the series. That's a combo as good as the two female leads. Women's ability in the acting and creative areas are making this one of the best shows on TV/DVD from America.

A super fantastic cop show taking place in the alleys, parking garages, streets, and fine places of beautiful Boston. But the crime is as ugly as the city is beautiful. And speaking of beauty, the 2 protagonists are hot. Angie Harmon plays Det. Jane Rozzoli the tough, sexy, sometimes sweet, sometimes funny murder investigator who takes on some bad boys and gets herself into dire straights. She has the scars to prove it, but the figure of a goddess. Her partner in crime, solving that is, comes in Medical Examiner Dr. Maura Isles, played by the equally gorgeous Sasha Alexander. She's loaded with nerdy trivia, which annoys Rozzoli, but gets the job done. She has nerves of iron and also injects many comic moments. It's a fine balancing act of suspense and comedy in a mystery crime show that works great.

Other cast members come into their own in different episodes. It is a series that has created a fine cast that quickly feels like family. Everyone has a history with a bit of a dark side as well as some fine personal moments. Lorraine Bracco is Ma Rozzoli, a generation older but yet a looker and doer. Her son Frankie Jr. (Jordan Bridges) is a Boston foot cop. Two other members of the murder squad are Det. Frost (Lee Thompson Young) who hates gore and Det. Korsak (Bruce McGill) older and wiser. They all appear each episode and play an important role.

5920840,5,B00EIXWMII,"The previews that TNT used initially weren't overly interesting and some of the critics gave this new show mediocre ratings. That being said, I'm glad I chose to ignore the critics (as usual) and give this new cop drama a shot. Glad I did. It rolls right along with well written story lines and nice touches of humor here and there to lighten up what could be a very dark premise. I can't rave enough about the casting of Angie Harmon as the tough-talking but occasionally insecure police detective Jane Rizzoli, who's driving ambition and outer roughness bely a compassionate individual who's trying to do the right thing, no matter what. Sasha Alexander is a wonderful breath of fresh air as Maura Isles, the science and medicine half of this dynamic duo. She plays Isles with just the right amount of nerdy quirkiness to make the character endearing and brilliant, without crossing over into annoying know-it-all territory.",1438128000,,926,4.904458598726115

It is nice to be able to watch the shows whenever I want, and while I would prefer to have it on instant video, so I wouldn't have to store the discs, this is much less expensive for some reason. There aren't as many episodes on a season as I would like, but I guess all shows are going to less shows each year.

Now, it is gradually descending into a hand-holding feel good family tragicomedy which detracts completely from the, otherwise good crime pursuits.

5920916,5,B00EIXWMII,"This show manages to blend the dark side of life with positive counter balance.  It takes me back to kind of TV I enjoy.

This show manages to blend the dark side of life with positive counter balance.

It is great to see a show about supportive friendship/family, with its ups & downs, in a way that I can relate to from my experiences with my own friends/life.

At times the writers seem to fall back on the standard formula for police drama, but more often than not, the show keeps a realistic balance of positive and negative.  Most of the story lines are well written; but I always wonder why it is necessary to always throw in a psychotic killer who keeps making appearances.

If less was shown about crazy, psychotic behavior, maybe there might be less of it in real life.  Life has many, many stories that can be told without the vicious, vindictive, crazy, characters being the main focus.

With all that said, Rizzoli & Isles is positively different enough from many of today's TV shows for me to really enjoy watching. it.",1421107200,,1033,4.516129032258065

5920966,5,B00EIXWMII,"I wondered after Season 3 if the writers could keep bringing sufficient depth to the story lines to keep my interest in S4. It didn't take many episodes for me to know the writers sure can! I actually enjoyed this season more than S3 primarily because the cases they have to solve continue to be involved and Jane and Maura's relationship grows stronger.

There is a wonderful chemistry between these two career women: one the Boston cop (Jane) and the other a forensic medico (Maura). They share their lives and families with each other in a way that I admire. The writers continue to pressure the friendship which helps increase it's depth.

The support cast add colour and vitality to both the girls friendship and case load.

Now, I haven't seen all the DVDs yet, and it will be a while before I'm done with all of the episodes, but if I come across any problems, I'm expecting the excellent Amazon customer service on customer satisfaction to jump in and make things right.

I have the other 3 seasons and several other series purchased from Amazon.  Have had absolutely no problems at all. I know what to expect as far as the programs.  It's just a matter of the quality of the DVDs.  That's the only issue any customer should be concerned with, and I haven't had any problems with any DVD I've ordered from Amazon.

Plus, Amazon's policy on editing reviews gives customers the opportunity to give fair, honest reviews so all can benefit.  I've edited reviews before, and will continue to edit any review that needs to be corrected by me, one way or another.",1402963200,,975,4.727810650887574
