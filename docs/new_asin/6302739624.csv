7830684,4,6302739624,"Do not be misled by some of the ad copy which described this excellent film as ""the other side of WW2"".  It does not attempt to convince the viewer that the Nazis were maybe not so bad, but is merely a gripping drama set almost entirely aboard a German submarine, and is probably the best film in that small sub-genre (submarine/war) ever made.  Definitely worth seeing.",1005350400,2,370,4.590909090909091
