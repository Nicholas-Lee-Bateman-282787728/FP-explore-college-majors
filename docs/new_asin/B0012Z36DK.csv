3100355,5,B0012Z36DK,"""Keyshia Cole: The Way It Is Season 2"" is probably the most engaging and entertaining reality show on television. The BET show follows the R&B diva trying to manage her blossoming music career and repatching once strained relationship with her birth mother Frankie, a recently paroled and recovering drug addict. The show also shows Keyshia repairing her relationship with her older sister, Neffe, a single mother, who was not raised with the adopted Keyshia. The show offers a no holds barred look into Keyshia's world without filters.

This show is as real as it gets. It shows Frankie's struggles to stay clean and earning her daughters respect for abandoning them during her drug induced haze. The show also shows Neffe's struggles with being a single Mom, and although not as extreme as her mother Frankie, also got caught up in street life and making bad decisions concerning the direction of her life. Keyshia has to deal with all this while trying to maintain her hot singing career. The show has plenty of love, drama, fights, music, etc., and nothing remains out of bounds. A must see DVD.",1211241600,6,1099,4.877005347593583

Maybe Keyshia Cole isn't just like us. Homegirl has been through hell and back and has persevered, a bonafide rose from the concrete. The Way It Is  The Complete Season Two give us a sustained peek into the helter skelter of America's Ghetto sweetheart. The young R&B icon has stayed true to her Oakland beginning as she brings her immediate family and close to share her public life.

Season two starts with Keyshia moving her family to her spacious house in Atlanta Georgia. It gives her sister Neffe, her mother Frankie, and her nieces an oasis from the streets of Oakland but also allows the family to go to numerous therapy sessions as her mother overcomes incarceration and crack addiction and the sisters overcome over their issues of abandonment.  The reality series plays on the side of drama which Keyshia herself admits when she calls up her sister ""straight up"" ghetto.

The turning point of The Way It Is comes when Keyshia Cole gets a visit from a man who claims to be her father. She and her sister go through an emotional paternity test to answer the question that has the source of the family's angst for the last 25 or so years. Although the test turns out to be another crazie plotting for a nanosecond of fame.  The recording of Just Like You is merely compared a subplot compared the paternity suits, scuffles, and rehabilitations meetings.

The Way It Is may get a scoff from viewers who yearn from more substantive tv, but at the very least heads will adamantly testify that Keyshia Cole is not Vanilla icing her life. Her drama is real and it's very admirable how navigates her high demand life.  Hip-hop diva wear many hats as she acts as caregiver to her niece, mentor to sister and mother, and dare we say prima donna (postponing Essence and King interview because of illness only to get her nails did later on in the day).  Keyshia Cole gets much `spect round these parts as she turns her troubled background into raw musical emotion.",1250985600,,1969,4.635057471264368
