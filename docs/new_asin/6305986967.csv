1108251,1,6305986967,"Eating human flesh makes for easy jokes. This movie has almost none. They seem to be more concerned about gore, which is boring as hell. Also, a movie like this needs at least one good horror or comedy actor. This film has none! Since many of the acters have appeared in major productions, the acting is acceptable. So, it's not funny in a SO BAD IT'S GOOD ED WOOD vain. There are better films to spend your money on!",1080518400,,417,4.291139240506329
1108252,5,6305986967,"This is without a doubt the dumbest hour I ever spent, and I loved every minute. Who couldn't love the humble undertaker, he's just trying to make a living and no one wants extras these days. This film works on many levels and has so much social, entertainment, and educational value, I don't know where to begin.
Check out the awful sound sinc when the chick fires the gun out the window. She fires twice, then you hear two bangs, THEN she thrusts her hips twice. Classic.
The undertaker loses his license plate, gets wounded and is about to be dumped in acid, when suddenly he helps Doc kill Mort in the acid. Did anyone catch this? Why did they do this?
How did the undertaker survuve a jump off a six story building and walk away without a scratch?
How did the undertaker take a leap at Thursday from two feet away and miss? She didn't even move!
What happened to Detective Glass in the end? Thursday ends up with the fat dude?
In 1967 gas was $0.32 a gallon? WOW.
This film leaves me in awe everytime I watch it. Next time I got a hankerin' for Leg of Lamb, Chicken Breast, or Hambur-Ger, I'm gonna get my butt down to the Greasy Spoon!",1079568000,5,1141,4.287037037037037
1108253,3,6305986967,"the 1967 version was much more gorier than this one , it showed the girl on the fence without boobs and that was for the breast of chicken, the leg of lamb  well there was more to it than it is now , all in all the movie has left out a lot of parts since i saw it in 1967 myself.the movie now is just fast and dumb. i have it on vhs and dvd, and neither one of them are like it was in 1967,, but oh well if you want it in your collection i would advise to buy it , for a much cheaper price then most have of course,,good luck and enjoy,,,,,",1078876800,7,540,3.6153846153846154
1108254,5,6305986967,"THE UNDERTAKER AND HIS PALS is about a trio of bikers (Doc, Spike, and Mort) who live only to find unwary citizens to slaughter in grisly ways. This is both logical and beneficial to our three fiends, since Doc and Spike add certain severed limbs of their victims to the menu of their diner (The Greasy Spoon), and Mort is a mortician who charges the victims' families big bucks to dispose of the leftovers. Our merry band of psychos have no redeeming qualities whatsoever, but boy are they hilarious! Just check out the ""coffin"" Mort puts on display for his bargain funeral! Enter detective Harry Glass, inept sleuth with a face that is best described as a James Brolin / Adam West hybrid. His gift seems to be getting beautiful assistants murdered without noticing. For the year it was made, TUAHP is a gorehounds dream. Fortunately, there is so much jet-black humor that the intentionally excessive bloodletting becomes (almost) funny. Highly recommended for adults only...",1070841600,5,976,4.921212121212121
1108255,5,6305986967,"The Undertaker and his Pals, an unsung B-movie heavily hinging the horrific with huge helpings of comedic relief, was something of a joy to watch. In fact, everyone I've showed it to thusfar - myself included - has found most of it, with the exception of the occasionally overdrawn chase scene or the moments when we have too much of driving cars/roving motorcycles, utterly intoxicating. I personally liked the move because it doesn't try to hide the facts within a cheaply insulting plot, opting instead to have fun with the concepts themselves and not with the frustration of the viewer.
Our tale begins with three bikers as they begin a reign of terror, one starting with them randomly locating the name of a potential victim in a phone book lovingly supplied in their friendly neighborhood telephone booth. There they locate the name of a Ms. Lamb, cruise on over to her home in their less-than-suspicious bikerwear (leather jacket, helmet, goggles, and cute little iron-on skull-and-crossbone insignias), and promptly being mutilating - I mean operating, keeping the legs and leaving the rest. Cut to our main character, a detective that lives to love the ladies, and his secretary as they go to the local diner, The Greasy Spoon, run by the illustrious Doc and Spike. The Detective decides to order the special of the day, leg of lamb, as his spicy secretary, Ms. Poultry, gets rude with Spike. Then, as another insult, the detective refuses to try the lamb, telling Spike that he's not sure what they're trying to pass off on their customers, while Ms. Poultry threatens to call the health department before the two depart. This, of course, leads to a new specialty item, breast of chicken, later on. Over the course of the movie we also learn about the Undertaker, Spike and Docs, friend, and his shady practices, the reason that Doc was kicked out of medical school, why women shouldn't hang out with detectives if they value their lives, how meals our named to add a little sarcasm to the killing and grilling business, and that the local police department/detectives in this movie are obviously as responsible, through bumbling, for the murders as the killers themselves.
The only unfortunate that the DVD has to offer is its quality, something I would have liked a bit more of, but asking that of a cheaper movie is asking a lot. Besides, it isn't too terrible and the movie itself, rolling punchlines through a veritable valley of gore, makes this issue only a small nuisance during an otherwise overly enjoyable experience.",1038614400,5,2538,4.890951276102088
1108256,3,6305986967,"I saw this movie back when it was showing on the big screen (outdoors at a drive-in: for those of you under thirty years old, yes they really did exist!) I spent the whole time in stitches. This movie is a real hoot! Unfortunately the tape is of poor quality, although that is to be expected with a film of this type; yet it is certainly watchable. And still very funny. After seeing this movie you will never feel quite the same about dining out...or funeral homes...or, well, life in general. It's a slasher movie, but not your run of the mill type. Actually it's a ""cut"" above the rest (oh no, there goes my sharp wit again.) I won't spoil it by telling you anything about the plot. You'll have to watch it if you want to know.",1012608000,,730,4.258992805755396

Way to go to VCI for offering us interesting DVD's for people bored of Hollywood garbage they continue to pump on us.  Hey folks, the film is CHEAPO, but it's entertaining...The foot in the meat grinder is pretty grizzly...a very high splatter count!  Also this DVD contains the original theatrical trailer (AMAZING!) and some other horror trailers that VCI has their hands on!  Grab the credit card, this is a fun disk.

7899343,2,6305986967,"""The Undertaker and His Pals"" is a moldy piece of stinky cheese from 1966 starring Ray Dannis (not to be confused with the vastly more talented Ray Dennis Steckler) as The Undertaker. The film revolves around three cannibal bikers led by Dannis on a culinary crime spree. The film opens with a girl whose last name is Lamb (bet you can't see this one coming...) who is killed and has her leg removed for use in the chef's special at ""The Greasy Spoon"" a diner run by the other two bikers. It was inevitable that the special the following day would be ""leg of lamb"", which Private Investigator Harry Glass and his secretary Miss Poultry (really) find not to their liking. Unfortunately for Miss Poultry, she's next on the hit list and the next day's special is equally predictable, although no more appetizing.

During their last killing, a woman shoots off the license plate of one of the bikes in the most unlikely piece of marksmanship in history, leading Glass and police ultimately to the solution to the puzzle with the assistance of twin vixens Thursday and Friday. The conclusion couples the least plausible accidental death scene in history with the worst closing theme song (""Cut In, Cut Up, Cut Out"") in ready recollection.

The film has atrocious production values. The color is so bad that parts of it appear almost to be black and white, while other parts are so skewed in blue and yellow color balance as to almost require sunglasses. The sound effects are not remotely well synched with the film, and the special effects are utterly laughable. The soundtrack relentlessly juxtaposes drum solos, jazz trumpet and saxophone licks, and ragtime piano snippets at completely random and meaningless locations, which were sometimes so jarringly inappropriate that their very presence made me laugh. The acting is horrible, and the script is riddled with stilted dialogue and continuity problems as well as inane logical problems. How did Dannis survive his fall from the top of a building to come back in the next scene? Why did the chef change from killing Dannis to killing his own wait staff in mid scene? I don't know, and I doubt that T.L.P. Swicegood, director of this mess, did either. Mercifully this film killed his career, so we don't have to endure more daily cannibalistic specials in a sequel.

The film is ostensibly a comedy, but really isn't funny. I generously gave it two stars for a modicum of camp value, and for the fact that it's only 66 minutes long. Sometimes less is more.",1228953600,,2505,4.793981481481482

7899346,2,6305986967,"The Undertaker and His Pals (T. L. P. Swicegood, 1967)

Swicegood, a writer for the TV series The Untouchables, took the directorial helm for the first time with The Undertaker and His Pals. It was the last anyone in Hollywood heard from him; not only his directorial career, but his writing career, vanished. It is not that hard to see why.

The Undertaker and His Pals is a beach comedy away from the beach, a softcore film without the sex. It certainly starts out with a shock; a woman is stalked by three masked motorcycle riders, then is attacked and killed, after which her legs are severed. The gore effects, for 1967, are stunning, and must have been shocking in the extreme to a pre-Night of the Living Dead audience. Unfortunately, Swicegood must have figured he couldn't get away with a whole film of such effects, and the explicit, deliciously shocking nature of the first scene is never to be found again. The movie descends into sixty-three minutes of slapstick, a Cro-Magnon version of Airplane! with cannibalism, but no one who can act nearly as well as Robert Hays. (And that's really saying something.)

Yes, the film is only sixty-three minutes long. And the crowning touch on this monkey is that even though the film is so short, it still has to resort to the old puff-out-the-time trick of repeating scenery. If you cut out the filler, the movie would probably have been forty-five minutes long. Which would not have been a bad thing. Much of the forty-five minutes are filled with actresses from sex comedies wearing as little as possible and silly special effects (there is one, about halfway through the film, that looks out-of-place, but is the only time during its length the movie comes even close to the power of the first sequence).

Probably good for a laugh, if you're under the influence, but otherwise, avoid it. * ",1108425600,,1848,4.744548286604362
