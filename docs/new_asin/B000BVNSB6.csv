8093304,4,B000BVNSB6,"This dvd was good! Two of the comedians weren't that funny to me but the other five were funny, so I don't feel like I wasted my money. And one of the comedians son was given a chance to shine and he was funny too. So there was a total of 8 stand-up acts. Jamie Foxx didn't really bring any ""funny"" in my opinion but he was a good host. All in all, it was worth the purchase.",1456099200,,375,3.8205128205128207
