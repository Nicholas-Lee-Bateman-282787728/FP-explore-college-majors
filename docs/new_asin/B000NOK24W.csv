8682504,2,B000NOK24W,"The DVD is too short. The techniques are not shown in a didactical, instructive manner. They are shown in order to impress, in a dim lit room with silver nunchaks. Also, I do not consider the double nunchaku techniques to be that advanced. There is an interesting material in the DVD, but I think that overall it has low quality/price ratio. It seems that the price is relatively high because of the computer graphics between the demonstrations.",1206403200,3,445,4.792207792207792
