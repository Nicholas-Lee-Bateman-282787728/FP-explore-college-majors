8313731,4,B001JTTJ8K,"Rukia Kuchiki's impending execution has been creeping up slowly for a whole season-and-a-half on ""Bleach."" And now it's finally here.

But the biggest bit of drama in the fourteenth volume of ""Bleach"" is: will Ichigo get his butt there in time to save the day, and will he be fighting Rukia's chilly big brother Byakuya? This volume has plenty of action, gutpunches and flashy fighting, although the three-captain duel is a substantial letdown since we never get to see 'em truly fight.

On the execution hill, the Soul Reapers assembled watch as Rukia is crucified high in the air, and the flaming Sokyoku is aimed at her -- only to be stopped in mid-air by a mysterious man with orange hair. And in short order, a bunch of other Soul Reapers show up -- Ukitake destroys the Sokyoku, Renji runs off with Rukia, and Ichigo singlehandedly defeats three lieutenants before taking on the lethal Byakuya Kuchiki -- with a devastating new power.

What's more, Soi Fon's abuse of Ukitake's third seat is interrupted by a masked woman who used to be her command -- and whom she's determined to destroy with her stinger-like zanpakuto. And the head captain, a crusty old jerk named Yamamoto, is enraged at the thought that his two prize pupils have followed their consciences, leading to a devastating battle between the three most powerful captains in the Soul Society.

The fourteenth  volume of the ""Bleach"" anime is all about the fighting -- fighting about principles, fighting for a life, and fighting for angry revenge. Not to mention Ichigo pummeling three lieutenants bare-handed in a matter of seconds. Okay, there's also Hitsugaya and Rangiku infiltrating a suspiciously quiet judicial council, but that's left unfinished. Hello suspense.

Instead, the focus is on fighting all over the place -- explosions of raw power, poisonous stings, flaming swords and Ichigo's new ability to zip around in a black coat, sending blasts of black energy. All these fights are juggled neatly, interspersed with solid dialogue (""The question that needs to be asked... is why the hell aren't you saving her?!"" ""Such a foolish question..."") and occasional comedy (""WE DON'T WANT ANYONE HEARING OUR VOICES!"").

The biggest letdown is honestly Yamamoto's fight with Ukitake and Kyoraku. Lots of intense buildup -- including a moral puzzle about ""true justice"" -- and the unveiling of two spectacularly unique zanpakutos. Then they attack and... nothing. We don't get to see 'em fight. Bleah.

Ichigo shows off a new confident side in these episodes -- it's no longer that he feels he has to win, but that he CAN win. And we catch a few glimpses of other characters' past: we see the fangirl crushing of Soi Fon's on her quirky Stealth Force commander Yoruichi, and see some collegiate memories of the girl-chasing Shunsui and the sweet, kindly Ukitake.

The fourteenth volume of ""Bleach"" is all slam-bang action and superpowered Soul Reapers, but there are hints of the conspiracy that still has to be uncovered.",1227052800,5,2995,4.985971943887775
