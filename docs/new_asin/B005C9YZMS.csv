4652325,4,B005C9YZMS,"Dark humor, black comedy, whatever you want to call it, this is it. Well acted by pros. Extremely weird, original plot. This isn't Shakespeare, this isn't slapstick, this is a very intriguing, original, well crafted, and provoking way to spend an hour and a half. Good movie to watch alone on a bored night or with a good friend with an open mind.",1375574400,2,347,4.523809523809524
4652326,5,B005C9YZMS,"This moving is about a serial killer so obviously it is somewhat dark, but it still manages to be funny and lighthearted.  I have watched it several times already, and will likely watch it again.  Great movie!  I definitely recommend if you are looking for a quirky date night movie.",1366156800,,283,4.62
4652327,4,B005C9YZMS,"Cute movie shot in Omaha, Nebraska.  Macabre humor with an odd twist.....fun to watch on a rainy or snowy day with nothing else to do.",1362960000,,134,4.36
4652328,1,B005C9YZMS,What a waste of time and money. This movie is really bad. I wouldn't be fooled by the friendly reviews and believe the people that wrote them are associated with the movie somehow. Have you seen how horrible For A Good Time Call is??? Ari Graynor is pretty cute but she needs to fire her agent. Two of the worst movies ever!!,1359244800,3,325,4.258064516129032
4652329,5,B005C9YZMS,My neighbor love this movie to the point that I had to seek out this movie just to get it as a gift.,1358121600,,100,3.391304347826087
4652330,4,B005C9YZMS,"This is one of those low key movies one does not see big marketing campaigns about.  There are some big names in it: Ann Margaret, for example.  Story is set in the small town in Iowa.  Two young people, who have known each other since childhood, work together in a small accounting firm.  They have known each other forever.  Both in some way are social misfits: he still lives in a same home with his mother; she is an orphan who likes to talk to her pet bird.

Their circumstances change when he wins lottery.  Except that the lottery ticket in question is not really his...  Before long, the two are married, only to realize that each one of them has a secret that may destroy their marriage.  This is interesting black comedy with very unusual ending.  It is a story of obsessive love, bond of loyalty and sometimes unusual ways some people can attain their happines...",1344211200,4,874,4.509554140127388
4652331,1,B005C9YZMS,"Seriosuly what the F are these studios making these days. This movie might be a career ender for Tom Hank's one and only semi-famous son. This storyline is horrible the performances are a joke and I would rather dump pool acid on my face than watch this horrible excuse for a black comedy again. I understand its an indie but it doesnt make the characters believable in the slightest bit. You've been warned.
Clearly ripped off from Dexter and the familiar headlines of lottery winners going psycho. Ari Graynor will move back to Hollywood purgatory after this garbage. She will never become a known commodity in the game after this lead role. Maybe if she showed off those melon tots somebody might care about her. But unfortunately for us and her she choose not to and can now settle back into obscurity. The one positive thing about this movie is the last song played over the end credits (thank God) called I Choose Happiness by David Choi and it's a very fitting song since the movie was over.",1336953600,4,998,4.612359550561798
4652332,3,B005C9YZMS,"""I think you won the lottery."" Shy and Goofy Ben (Hanks) has had a crush on the receptionist Lucy (Graynor) at his office for a long time. She doesn't know he exists. When Ben comes home and finds that he has won the 36 million dollar lottery Lucy finally talks to him. When secrets come out their relationship, and morals are challenged. This is a hard movie to review. While it wasn't a bad movie and did have some funny parts, the trailer is misleading and this wasn't what I was expecting. The trailer made it look like more of a comedy then it was. Hanks does a good job playing this type of character, but the movie overall felt a little flat and boring. Like so many other movies recently it feels like there is something missing to make this better. It also felt like with this idea they could have done so much more. All that being said this movie is not terrible and if you go in expecting less of a comedy then the trailer shows you will probably enjoy this. Overall, not a bad movie, but nothing like I was expecting. Because of my expectations I didn't like it as much as I thought. I give it a B-.

Would I watch again? - Most likely no.",1318118400,7,1151,4.208144796380091
4652333,4,B005C9YZMS,"Unique,creative,and interesting. Collin Hanks, and Arizona Graynor fans will be pleased. Also a great introduction to those actors if unfamiliar. Is it going to win Oscars, No. Is it a fyn little film,Yes.",1472342400,,205,5.242424242424242

4652335,4,B005C9YZMS,"The movie is backward.. it starts out, ""ok"" then get interesting, then turns into a comedy, then just leaves ya wondering why you tuned in at all. Like I said, it should have started about 30 from the end, and then expounded on that theme.. a lot of wasted potential",1471910400,,266,4.34

4652355,4,B005C9YZMS,What a quirky movie. He could do no wrong and she could do no right and he was a serial killer! I was disappointed by the end. It was wonderful to see Ann Margaret again. It was funny though,1467676800,,190,3.8974358974358974

This has the same wardrobe as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barry-Munday/dp/B00412C31W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barry Munday</a>&nbsp;which unfortunately is not as rewatchable.

It's better than that Lysine movie with Matt Damon.  It's just light and pretty like an Easter basket from Woolworth's.

She's better in this than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scoop/dp/B000IU37SO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scoop</a>.",1376870400,,784,9.971830985915492

8465043,5,B005C9YZMS,Its a very entertaining dark comedy. The key qualifier is dark.  Do not watch this if you are looking for more of a mainstream comedic title.  Colin Hanks and Ari Graynor play these characters very well.  Its not an easy feat to make such eccentric characters so endearing. It is a lot of fun to watch if you are open to a more abstract perspective on comedy.,1487980800,,359,4.3283582089552235
