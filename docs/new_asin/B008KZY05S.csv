8528762,1,B008KZY05S,"This is NOT a documentary so much as a news type E! True Hollywood Story - I wouldn't watch it if it was free on cable network - what a rip off.  There is no way she approved this as there isn't anything styled that is her, the interviews are people who we don't know or don't care about.  It's obvious they couldn't get the rights to her work and there's nothing behind the scenes we haven't seen on MTV before - I don't care who these people they interview are - they aren't people we know or care about and they are acting like experts.  The interviewer needs a better wig, holy terrible.  The background music is annoying and terrible and overpowering as though they didn't edit properly and it's more in the foreground.  It is obviously the music you don't need to buy the rights to either (think student film using iMovie generic music) - it's THAT bad.  The voice over person mispronounces words wrong (saying dingy - as in a dingy looking apartment - and pronounces it as though it's a small boat called a dingy).  This person is NOT a voice over person - needs to do some voice work - weak, weak, weak.  I'd never be this insulting if I wasn't so shocked by the amateur, low quality of this.  I WANT MY MONEY BACK!",1375574400,5,1223,4.282608695652174
8528763,2,B008KZY05S,"Clips of Lady Gaga repeated continiously throughout the video. there were no videos of any popular songs. There was no one on one interview with Lady Gaga. The video was random stylists & analysts offering opinions of Lady Gaga's wardrobe, meanings of songs ,etc. and some British stylists & analysts comments were difficult to understand. The product discription was misleading. My wife is a Gaga fan &  I bought this as a Christmas gift for her & we were both very disappointed.",1356912000,9,480,4.853658536585366
8528764,4,B008KZY05S,"It was OK for documentary. I thought there would be more performances.
But I still like all the info it came with about her!",1355097600,2,124,4.208333333333333
8528765,2,B008KZY05S,"First of all, the product description is very misleading. There is no one-on-one interview hosted by Paris Hilton; there is, however, about 45 seconds of a filmed encounter between Lady Gaga and Paris Hilton after ""Just Dance"" was released. But this is just stock footage, it's nothing new, and it's not the entire thing, just less than a minute of sound bites. There are no appearances by Beyonc&eacute;, Justin Timberlake, or Madonna. There is stock footage of interview clips of Usher, Kylie Minogue, and Rihanna (spelled ""RHIANNA"", making you wonder about the production values involved) talking about Lady Gaga when she first hit the scene, about 15 seconds from each person. Again, nothing new to this DVD. And the ""appearance by Madonna"" is the Saturday Night Live clip they did together replayed on this DVD in pieces (not straight through). There are no performance clips, riveting or otherwise, just repeated public appearance clips without sound shown during the voiceovers. There are no unbelievable stories revealed, and none of the people interviewed actually know Gaga. One person interviewed met her briefly, but that's as close as any of them get. It's also about an hour long, not 70 minutes as listed. And the reviewer that says she learned a whole bunch about Gaga that she never knew before is obviously a fake review, because there is no new information revealed in this DVD. Unless you didn't know Gaga has had a lot of hit songs and wears avant-garde outfits.

It's not a horrendous mess like Dancing In the Dark: The Unauthorized Documentary, there are some good points to this DVD. Pros: some of the footage of Gaga I had never seen before, so there was something new in this DVD that was worthwhile; there are a few intelligent commentaries on Gaga from the people interviewed; and it was interesting to see actual famous people talking about Gaga, even though it's old stock footage.

But I can't rate it higher than two stars for all the bad points to this DVD. Cons: the footage clips that are shown are repeated to death; the footage shown usually had nothing to do with the subject of the voiceover, such as when they were talking about the prosthetic bones Gaga wore on her face when Born This Way was released and paired that with a clip of Gaga wearing a black mask that had already been shown like five times already; the people interviewed don't know Gaga and don't have anything to do with Gaga, and the majority of them are just time wasters to pad the length of this ""documentary"" (and most of them are British, despite the voiceover person being American)(and being a contestant on X Factor UK does not make you a ""British Pop Star"" by the way); there's nothing new here that any Gaga fan remotely familiar with her story doesn't already know, although two of the people interviewed had interesting things to say about Gaga; and the voiceover person mispronounces words that make you wonder if they did any sort of quality control checks in the editing [she pronounces dingy (din-jee) like dinghy, and Lollapalooza as Lowlapalozza, and Rihanna (ree-ah-nah) as ri-hannah].

While not a complete waste of an hour of my life, I probably would've been satisfied saving the $13 I spent on this DVD knowing what I know about it after watching it. Beware of fake placed reviews!!",1354752000,2,3313,4.8087719298245615
