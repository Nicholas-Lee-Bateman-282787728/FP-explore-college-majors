8373744,5,B002MA6M62,This is a well-done video tour of NOLA since Hurricane Katrina. It really shows how this city and its people have striven to bring a wonderfully historic city back to life after a great tragedy.  Well worth watching and very educational.,1360886400,,237,4.780487804878049
8373745,4,B002MA6M62,"Overall, I thought this video was excellent. The narrator had a rich and melodious voice. It took you to many of the major spots in New Orleans, and a few outside of the city (Laura and Oak Alley Plantation; Bayou country). My only criticism is they focused only on the touristy areas like the CBD, Garden District and the French Quarter. I wish the video had been extended and gone to some of the other neighborhoods.",1355011200,,418,4.5131578947368425
8373746,4,B002MA6M62,My wife and I are planning a trip to the big easy to celebrate a birthday milestone.  We've been trying to get our hands on anything that can help us plan our trip.  Books and on-line references are great tools but nothing gets you more ready or excited than a good travel video.  This brought all of the elements of New Orleans to our living room.  The only reason I would hold back from giving a 5 star rating is that I was hoping to get a little more information on the culinary side of NO.  This video certainly helped and still remains a great way for us to not only look forward to our trip but to remember it when we come back!!!,1260748800,,636,4.096774193548387
