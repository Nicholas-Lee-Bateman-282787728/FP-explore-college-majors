8155166,2,B000K985YO,"Very dry for a video on water!  Little is covered on acquiring water in a desert environment, in fact, the only ""skill"" is the solar still.
There is some good information for the beginner desert hiker between the commercials for a desert golf resort and some other stuff.
A recap: Dress in loose clothing, cover up, wear sunscreen, carry 2 gallons of water at least (16 lbs!), use a wide brimmed hat, carry a first aid kit, bring salty snacks, rest in the shade, bring a whistle and an emergency blanket, use gloves to pick up wood or knock it first with a staff to avoid a ""nasty bite"" from a scorpion (bite? sting...), carry three fire starters and a signal mirror, bring long underwear, a fleece and a hat in case you have to stay overnight. Oh yeah, and don't forget your compact silver umbrella for instant shade.
The information in this video is good for kids or someone with a mild interest in desert hikes, for anyone actually wanting to go into the desert I suggest they get David Alloway's book ""Desert Survival Skills"".",1185062400,2,1030,4.537634408602151
