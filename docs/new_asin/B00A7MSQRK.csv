5392559,4,B00A7MSQRK,"This is a little different from the original (Patrick Swayze version) and was enjoyable. There were also many similarities.  North Korea, with the assistance of Russia, invade many areas of the US.  Several folks get away and head for the hills (Seattle and Spokane Washington).  The folks train and decide to fight back, calling themselves the Wolverines.

There is a good deal of action and the film was well done.",1353801600,5,416,4.9
5392560,5,B00A7MSQRK,"First off, to anyone who actually saw the original, the story is not exactly the same, which, in my opinion is good. It made the movie a bit more in tune with this generation. Now, these other reviews I have read really leave me scratching my head. They talk about the ""convenience"" of finding a cabin in the wood (obviously never saw the original), the rampant patriotism (once again). You need to remember this is a REMAKE of a movie that was made when there were fears of soviet invasion, a different era from now. I enjoyed the original and I also enjoyed this one. The acting of all involved parties was not oscar worthy but I also did not expect it to be. The story and emotions it tries to bring across of having your home destroyed and losing the people you care about is there. For people who enjoyed the original I think they will enjoy this too, however, do not go into it expecting the same exact story.",1353801600,5,915,4.356725146198831
5392561,5,B00A7MSQRK,"I don't know why people think it sucks it's really good I went to go see it and was not disappointed the acting was good and even had some humor I think if your so concerned to buy it or not first rent it but it's a really good movie. I think that the way people are judging this movie is way to harsh. I think that people should rent, or buy this movie and make their own opinion about. Yes it's very different, but yet if it was just like the original movie then there would be complaints about how nothing new was brought to this movie. Almost every single low review is comparing it to the original, well then if that what you were doing when watching the movie then of course your not gonna like! Cause your already judging it. The acting isn't as bad as people say it is. However, Josh Hutcherson should had gotten Josh Peck's role.",1353801600,7,838,4.179012345679013
5392562,5,B00A7MSQRK,It was a real good movie had some humor and this will be one of my favorite movies I will buy this movie once i can pre-order it,1353801600,4,128,3.607142857142857
5392563,1,B00A7MSQRK,"The release of the updated version of ""Red Dawn"" was pushed back over two years thanks to MGM's financial issues. When a movie is put on the shelf for a long period of time, it usually isn't a good sign; ""The Cabin in the Woods"" is an exception. ""Skyfall"" and ""The Hobbit"" were also affected, but production was mostly just delayed rather than being a finished product collecting dust. With how excellent ""Skyfall"" turned out to be and its massive box office in-take, expectations for ""Red Dawn"" were at least to be marginally decent. Well pucker up, sweet cheeks and rub some dirt on it. ""Red Dawn"" is so bad you're going to have to lube yourself up before seeing it just to keep the crap that it spews at you from sticking to your greasy flesh.

Everything initially unfolds like all of the worst parts of the ""Transformers"" movies. Did you hate seeing Sam's mom eat pot brownies in ""Revenge of the Fallen?"" Did you groan when Wheelie humped Megan Fox's leg? Your face is about to have rug burn you'll be facepalming so much. ""Red Dawn"" still manages to squeeze in all of these stupid teenage problems nobody cares about even amongst the invasion of North Korea in Spokane, Washington.

Matt Eckert (Josh Peck) costs his football team the game because he's too busy trying to be a hero as the quarterback and then wonders why it eats at him after it's all over. Then afterward, they all meet at a bar while Matt's brother Jed (Chris Hemsworth) has just come home after being gone for six years in the military and reunites with Toni (Adrianne Palicki) and they reminisce about all of the making out and dating they didn't do over the years. Then after everything hits the fan, Robert (Josh Hutcherson) and Daryl (Connor Cruise) rob a Subway while making the dumbest one-liners you've ever heard. Oh, they're eating wheat bread? At least they're eating healthy during an invasion. And look, Daryl is putting a bucket under the self-service soda dispenser. Guerrilla warfare has never felt this juvenile.

The entire movie is built around the Eckert family; Matt specifically. Josh Peck is one of the reasons the movie is so painful. He at least seemed more tolerable in ""The Wackness,"" but his Nickelodeon roots from his days on ""The Amanda Show"" and ""Drake and Josh"" seem to come back to haunt him now because you cannot take Matt seriously. He has that predictable back story to him; the hothead little brother overshadowed by his big brother that miraculously finds a way to overcome the odds. But Matt makes the dumbest decisions imaginable like risking the location of the only people not captured by the North Koreans just to save his girlfriend. Matt is just extremely stubborn and has that chip on his shoulder that just makes you want to slap the hell out of him.

This is the acting debut of Connor Cruise, but you can't even really call it that. He has the same blank look on his face the entire movie and even the tears he sheds in the movie look like somebody threw a few drops of water on his face so he wouldn't have to show any actual emotions.

In the meantime, you have to put up with this forced patriotic B.S. ""These people invaded our home and we have to FIGHT because we live here."" That's the bottom line of the speech Chris Hemsworth gives to win over the entire group. Just about every big moment can be seen coming way ahead of time. The camera work gets on your nerves, too. It's one of those movies that insist on the camera always moving and making everything really difficult for your brain to process whenever gunfire, explosions, or any sort of action takes place.

Everything that is said and that occurs in ""Red Dawn"" will leave you snickering and rolling your eyes because it is so bad. The Eckert family has a pickup truck that can drive through barricades and over fire. Josh Peck seems to channel Shia LaBeouf throughout the entire movie (""Come on!"") and the ending will leave you wondering when Matt had the time to memorize or write down what he says. Josh Hutcherson drinks fresh deer blood and that is the highlight of his character. No one in the movie ever doesn't feel like filler.

Without ever seeing the original film, it's difficult to say how ""Red Dawn"" compares but the 1984 film cannot be this bad. ""Red Dawn"" is like the cinematic equivalent of burping and having a little bit of barf emerge at the back of your throat. Then your esophagus burns as you swallow the disgusting liquid. That aftertaste that makes you stick out your tongue, curl your lip, and stings your nostrils, that's ""Red Dawn."" You'll want to strap yourself into one of the vehicles with a car bomb attached to it just to get out of finishing the stupid thing.",1353715200,18,4684,4.5823389021479715
5392564,4,B00A7MSQRK,"I just came back from seeing this film in a theatre. I am a huge fan of the original Red Dawn, so I was anxious to see this one! This is an excellent movie, well acted by some of todays hottest young stars as well as some newcomers, and, if you have never seen the original, this movie can totally stand on it's own merit. That having been said, this movie just doesn't have the heart and soul of the original. They don't go as in depth with the character development, and they changed some key points, some of which, in my opinion, were what makes the original so great. In the original none of the kids had any military training. That was one of the things that made their accomplishments so great. In this film, the main character is a marine on leave. I felt that the deer hunting scene in the original was important because it explained Roberts complete charcter change. In the new film, the deer hunting scene is made into a joke, and I did laugh, but was sort of disappointed. The movies are basically hard to compare because they start with the same concept and then take it in totally different directions. I LOVE the original, but did enjoy this one. However, as with any movie, it is a matter of personal taste. I took my two daughters with me and one liked the original best, while the other prefers this film. Regardless it is worth seeing, and, if you haven't seen the original, I would highly reccomend you see it as well!",1353628800,24,1437,4.365671641791045
5392565,5,B00A7MSQRK,"I am glad that the remake did the original justice. Me and my dad watched it when it first came out on VHS...I think we had to buy the video store a new copy because we actually watched it so much and ruined the tape. I was hoping some of the original scenes were there. To keep it kind of true to form.
The Theatrical release did poorly...It actually bombed at the box office, but retailers couldn't keep it stocked on shelves when it came out and became an instant cult phenomenon. This movie brings back fond memories of watching it, and bonding with my father...This is going to be my first Blu Ray purchase. And I will buy the new one when it comes out as well.",1353628800,6,666,4.2109375
5392566,2,B00A7MSQRK,"I loved this movie when it first came out. I watched this one before the original 1984 version. After watching that version though, this one is very hard to watch.

5392581,1,B00A7MSQRK,"Completely 100% totally unwatchable. Really North Korea invading the United States? They can't even feed their own population. Not only is the plot absolutely ridiculous but the action is very unrealistic and cheesy. This ""remake"" and I use that term very loosely should never have been made. The original is an absolute classic but this is a total travesty that lowers the IQ of anyone who watches it. Do your self a favor and do not bother wasting precious brain cells watching this heaping pile of garbage. In fact just pretend it does not exist. Just rewatch the original if you are in the mood to watch a bunch of commies get whats coming to them.",1519689600,,652,4.629310344827586

5392584,3,B00A7MSQRK,"The original is 10 times better in several categories; writing, acting, casting. the 1984 cast was a star studded 80s cast. And they were actually a good fit for their roles. the 2012 cast, other than Hemsworth, his dad, the n korean leader and of course The Comedian, everyone else seemed to fall off the Mandy Moore bus and just missed the audition for american pie or friday night lights. Charlie Sheen's chacter > way better than the new one... what a whiny bitch.",1517788800,,468,4.583333333333333
5392585,4,B00A7MSQRK,"The 1980's were an amazing time for film and Americana. Great movies were made with a patriotic American President and stories that brought forth the indomitable spirit of the nation. Red Dawn (1984) was a real classic, back in the day Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen were at the dawn of their careers as they brought forth a real but hopeful vision of America in the face of the Soviet Menace. The battle cry of a Wolverine still brings a chill down the spine.

So its both flattering and slightly insulting that one would remake such a great film for present day. 2012 America isn't 1984 America. We face threats from terrorism among us in our cities and cyberspace. But he idea that we could be held up against a threat of a nuclear menace doesn't seem as possible like it was back then. North Korea is imposing with its nukes and Russia is still a petty bully, but petty enough to make war and overwhelm the US? I don't think so.

But if you take away this and add to it an awesome cast of actors and actresses then you get a good time watching a decent film full of action and adventure. I mean this has Chris Helmsworth (Marvel's Thor), Josh Peck (Drake & Josh), Josh Hutcherson (Hunger Games Series), Adrianne Palicki (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.) and many more actors with a future in this business. Maybe not as big but they are starting out. Hemsworth's role is just as strong as Swayze was as he holds the team of High School kids into a guerrilla war against the communist North Korean regime occupying the state of Washington. The story holds more strength than the original movie in certain areas amidst the flaws in presenting North Korea military as an occupation force. Nice to show most of the training and how good most of the kids play the roles.

Its not a bad movie, I'm surprised they didn't get any of the original cast to make cameos in this movie. Pretty good. Love the Blu-Ray and Digital Copy",1517184000,,1916,4.484240687679083

BUT if you like lot and lots of action without a lot of CGI, then this movie fits the bill. The writing was a little sketchy and some of the acting was iffy but I gave it 4 stars because it is worth watching again and again.

5392747,3,B00A7MSQRK,"A remake of the original film. with a few faults one fault is, it's very dark and you loose your bearing and you really can't see who is shot and killed and where the shooting is coming from it's just way to dark mainly towards the end. It misses the mark as remakes often do. They had a chance to make a great movie but they missed the mark. Not that it's bad but the original is that much better. I love remakes that are done right. It shares some similarities but there are many changes, some good some not so good. There are a few things I found with the script that are far fetched but the actors did a great job despite the at times a crappy script. The film failed to keep my attention and even lost my interest at times I could care less if I saw it or not. That what makes it disappointing to me as I had high hopes for this film because I am such a fan of the original movie. If you like the original; you kinda want to see this movie if not I'd pass on it.

Each character has their own story to tell and man, Hemsworth dies again. Is it his career goal to follow the foot steps of Nicholas Cage who manages to get himself killed in his films? Not that I have anything against it, but seriously...it kind of kills the buzz. Okay, steering it back to Red Dawn, this is a good film everyone, very unexpected.",1432944000,,526,4.377551020408164

The biggest problem is the movie is fatally flawed from the beginning.  It was originally supposed to be the Chinese invading and the whole movie was made with that in mind.  Someone decided it might offend the Chinese and they are our good friends and trading partners so after the movie was made, it was decided to go back and make it North Korea.  Supposedly they had to go back and CGI the uniforms to make it NC.  There aren't enough people in North Korea to invade us, it's completely ridiculous.  If the entire population of North Korea was airlifted to the US, it still wouldn't be enough people to invade us.  So the movie is dead before it even gets started.  They should have scrapped it when it was decided not to risk offending the Chinese",1428451200,2,882,4.525316455696203

The character development was not really there at all and the premise less believable.  There is no viable reason for the Chinese to invade the U.S. and the Soviet/Cuban invasion premise of the original was much more reasonable.

The character development in the original was good as well, the characters grew and their relationships changed as they fought to take their country back from the invaders.  In this remake it seemed like they were all just playing a video game and intent on nothing more than killing as many of the invaders as possible.

Ostensibly, a re-thinking of the '80's version, now substituting North Koreans for Soviets/Cubans, with gag-inducing doses of 'diversity' and 'multi-culturism'.

The film did, however, strike a responsive chord with the American public, those whom the Hollywood elites hate, and has become somewhat of a classic of 1980's film. This new thing shrivels in any comparison. Choc-a-bloc full of cliched Hollywoodisms, with lousy pacing and stiff unbelievable acting, one will be floored how far cinema has spiralled since the heyday of the '80's.

5393025,3,B00A7MSQRK,This re-make is much better then the original but still silly fiction. I was an Army officer and had trouble suspending as much belief as needed to get passed the many plot holes of both the Enemy and the High School Kids. Several of the events were so ludicrous I laughed out loud. They have so much logistical lift they can bring in orange jump suits for prisoners but bring only one radio and that cannot be secured with rolling encryption? The kids are on the run for only a few days and equip a lair big enough to drive a truck into with enough supplies and lighting that it would take three times their number just to carry half the stuff there. AND the enemy is so stupid they have no patrols and they cannot even look on a Topo map or do a Google search to find such a a structure.,1426118400,,789,4.163398692810458

The current version was supposed to start the Chinese invading, which at least would've been theoretically possible. As they were worried it would upset our biggest trading partner and lender they changed it to North Korea, hehehe yeah right, who couldn't invade anyone not landlocked to them. The movie was mediocre at times but I would never waste more of my time re-watching it. If you're going to remake a classic you need to start with what was going on at the time the original was made including the attitude of the director.

5393052,2,B00A7MSQRK,"Red Dawn (2012) is a decidedly inferior remake of the 1984 Cold War classic of the same name. Of this films many faults, the worst that it fails to give the antagonists any personality. The original film did an excellent job of giving the invaders believable, and complex human personalities; they were fearsome, and at the same time fearful. The enemy commander (in that case a Cuban) was conflicted about his mission, yet cunning and ruthless. The personalities of the enemy played well off those of the American insurgents/freedom fighters, who were also fearless, fearful, cunning, ruthless and conflicted. The result is an interesting, and action pacted film which held the audience's interest.

 In the remake the enemy is given only a superficial personality; that of a communist aggressor. We know they're communists because they fly a red star flag, and post large signs in public saying things like ""Corporate Corruption"" and "" You are the victims of capitalism."" And we know they're aggressors because...well... they invade the US. But that's about the extent of their identities. They are slow witted, predictable, and more than a little inept targets whose only real function is to be out-witted, and shot down by the American insurgent/freedom fighters. The result is just another predictable, and boring action movie. Ho-hum.

Would I watch Red Dawn (2012) again? Nope

Instead I'd watch Red Dawn (1984)",1425600000,,1418,5.1521739130434785

5393056,5,B00A7MSQRK,"I admit it. I watched the original when it came out on VHS and I love that movie. That may even be when I fell in love with Patrick Swayze, RIP, and Charlie Sheen. They are your basic gritty teenage boys who lead their fellow teenagers to fight. Yes, they have it tough and try their best to survive off the land. They make hard decisions and they win our hearts. That is Red Dawn the original.

I have read some of the reviews on here and I think they are being rather hard on Red Dawn the remake. If they had never seen the original, would they have thought this was the best movie ever written? Not really a fair question. But I think that is exactly how they need to approach this movie. It isn't the original. It is a remake. When I heard they were remaking the film I was not happy. Just one more white washed version of the movie that I love.

Watching this version I couldn't help thinking that this movie made more sense to me than the original did. If you watch this one expecting to see the original, you will be disappointed. I think the writers were smart to make it their own. Since I don't play ""Call to Duty"", I can't tell you if it is a video game on the screen. All I can say is that I liked it. So these guys don't spout Red, White, and Blue. They do have their own sense of duty and that is to the place that they call their home. My only regret is the shaky cameras on some of the scenes. I know why Hollywood does it but I don't like it. Never will.

I suggest that you give the movie a chance. Don't judge it by the original. Judge it by its own merits. If you love the original and you want this to be the same, then don't watch this movie. That is a path to disappointment.",1425427200,,1698,4.017751479289941

5393128,1,B00A7MSQRK,Nowhere near the quality of the original and that movie was never that great to begin with. It's like whoever wrote the script thought they could piece together a good storyline by adding predicted and overplayed emotional queues. This plays like an NC propaganda film with more rocket launchers than shotguns.,1422576000,,310,5.098039215686274
5393129,5,B00A7MSQRK,"really liked this version of Red Dawn. It is similar to the original. There are scenes that you will recognize from the original but there are also many parts that are different. so if you are wanting to watch a 'remake' of the original, this is not it. It was close enough for me, though. I really liked the original and I like this version as well. I really like Chris Hemsworth as the main character; however, did not like the actor, Josh Peck, that plays his brother. I, also, liked Adrianne Palicki in the movie. She was in GI JOE the Retaliation and is now in Marvels Agents of Shield.",1422144000,,591,4.333333333333333
5393130,3,B00A7MSQRK,Not a terrible movie. Having been in my late teens when the original came out I was a little biased going into checking this one out. Whenever a remake is made I enjoy it more if it doesn't copy the original exactly.

5393134,5,B00A7MSQRK,I really liked this one other than the fact that his little brother is a weenie and and the wimpy guy from The Hunger Games is in it.

5393135,4,B00A7MSQRK,"When people compare a movie to its predecessor of 28 years, I just sigh... it's like comparing a movie to a book.  If you can't judge a movie on its own merits, just shut up.

This is not the end-all-be-all of movies.  There's decent action, fair character development, and the overt plot is secondary to the subplot... makes for a good evening rental.  Not one to buy, but I buy very few.

Ignore the people old enough to remember the 30yo predecessor and cannot move beyond it and choose to watch a movie that'll give you some mid-of-the-line entertainment done well.",1421366400,,569,4.594059405940594

The OG Red Dawn was and still is one of my favorite childhood movies. This movie tried to necro some of that but should have just been named something else. Maybe have had it a different town dealing with the invasion.

I gave it 3 stars do to it being an ok film, the new generation might like it, even though the kid side of me wanted to give it 2 stars for butchering the name of a great movie.",1421193600,,628,4.056451612903226

5393180,3,B00A7MSQRK,"I saw the original Red Dawn movie when I was in High School so I avoided watching this movie for a couple of years. If I hadn't seen the first version of the movie I probably would think this movie was great. It's an updated version that I think could be plausible. If you don't care about character development being realistic and only just want to see the ""action"" aspect, then you'll like this movie. Compared to the original movie, the character development was rushed. Two major aspects of the original version were included but brushed over; one being the betrayal, the other was how the emotions of the situation were not poignant to the main character/older brother. Rather, instead the emotions were made into this ""tough guy"" who stutters and has problems complimenting his younger brother because it makes him look weak. Then, of course made fun of by the younger brother. Rather than being a true ""moment"" between the brothers, I believe it was there for the sole purpose of a transition because of what happens right afterwards. It is an attitude that I find distressing and not true to the original version nor true to the character of someone in the military. It gives the sense of having hints of homophobia and seems to me to be placed in the script to help motivate the younger brother. The pettiness and selfishness of the younger brother suddenly changing after he gets what he wants (the girl) making him the hero just seems a bit off to me. His lack of love and respect for his older brother makes it even more unrealistic that he would become the hero and new leader in the end. The casting bothered me too in that the brothers and father did not at all even look alike nor were they the same height, making it unbelievable . I felt the acting was good but wish the writers/directors/producers would have stuck closer to the original script.",1419897600,,1864,4.617469879518072

5393264,3,B00A7MSQRK,"I saw the original movie as a kid and loved it.  I saw it again a few years ago and still liked it, so when it came up on my Amazon prime I was excited to watch it again.  Then I realized it was a remake and thought ""Maybe they updated it and made it even better"".  Unfortunately that is not the case.  The original movie seemed much more realistic to me and this one was too much like the typical blockbuster nowadays where the heroes always manage to do incredible and unrealistic things.

I still enjoyed the movie for a normal action blockbuster, the acting was fine and all of that.  However, it just did not seem believable like the first movie.  I did not find myself imagining what it would be like if this really happened like I did with the original.  I also did not get any kind of strong connection with any of the characters.  Many of the scenes were just not believable, and I didn't find myself relating to or caring about any of the character on anything more than a superficial level.

This does make me want to go back and watch the original again to see if I still feel the same or not watching that one.",1418428800,,1123,4.205607476635514

5393266,3,B00A7MSQRK,"Not a bad movie.  Not a great movie.  Just a shadow of the original starring Patrick Swayze.  Nothing really held my interest.  The bombings were a yawn.  The way the teenage rebels were able to move freely around the town was hard to believe.  The way they got weapons and killed soldiers from the invading army even more hard to believe.  This has to be one of the worse invading armies I have ever seen.  The teenagers shot better than any of the soldiers.  And that cry of ""Wolverines"" did not inspire me.  Halfway through I couldn't stop thinking, ""Give me a break.""  The story line fell flat and didn't pick up the whole movie.  I mean, I could follow the plot.  I just didn't care about the people getting killed or saved.  I sat through the entire flick and can safely say, ""There really is no reason to watch this film.""",1418342400,,829,4.368421052631579

It was about a small group of kids that knew they weren't going to ever defeat the enemy they just wanted to be a nuisance and survive. This one they are superheros who can move about freely and basically do what they pleased. They could even change the course of the war by stealing a bit of Korean technology, and of course they succeed.

5393361,5,B00A7MSQRK,Good remake,1415491200,,11,5.0
5393362,5,B00A7MSQRK,"I watched this version first, not knowing it was a remake, so I'm obviously biased towards it, but seeing the first version now, I have to say no person should even criticize this movie until they've seen and understood the original, frankly I don't think anyone has the right to. If you saw both and still don't like the remake, then more power to you to disregard anything I say/type. I'm half awake and probably don't know what I'm talking about anyway.. or do I?

For those complaining that it doesn't do the original justice, they really need to make sure why they're are differences to begin with. This means realizing that this movie is R.E.M.A.K.E! Don't mean to be a b... but seriously. This movies isn't exactly like the original because it was redone to fit the appropriate time period.

Instead of fighting Cubans, they fight North Koreans. Why? Because in that time, Cuba was a more recent threat than North Korea was trying to be in 2012 (Don't remember the details but there was some kind of bluff thing from North Korea).

The original had more 'western outlaw/bandit' style fighting because it was more popular in the eighties. Now people just want to see more hand to hand and hardcore fighting, as opposed to the more relentless gunfire ambush.

Also, the remake has things actually have COMMON SENSE. Yeah it's nice to think that a group of normal teens can fight back against a major enemy, but without the addition of a Marine that the remake has, how does it make sense that ordinary teens can use heavy machinery and devise well planned out schemes BEFORE the Airforce guy even shows up?

Some things that should be go without saying when comparing the two are the difference in effects and acting. Honestly, acting was much better in the past, no matter what movie we're comparing. Obviously the effects are far far better in this remake but  the original still is okay.. though the gun shot/wound timing is incredible lagged... again, it's older so that's excusable.

Understanding these differences, then you can judge the movie. I still pick this one over the original. While I like the actors better in the original, the character buildup is far better. Probably because it's more realistic, the teens actually feel like teens instead of experienced killers. I didn't really feel much when certain characters died, partly because they all seemed so heartless when facing the enemy. The original felt like a hunting game while the remake felt like true battle. Mainly because, like I said, much of the fight in the original was long distance and didn't feel like ""action"". The remake really provides that ""close to home"" feeling. The ending of the remake is also much more satisfying.

Final verdict: Both movies were exceptional in their respective settings. Both are worth seeing, but must be reviewed after seeing each.",1415404800,,2850,4.825819672131147

5393371,5,B00A7MSQRK,Excellant movie,1415059200,,15,7.0
5393372,1,B00A7MSQRK,"This movie is one in a long line of remakes intent on giving an ""updated"" version of a better quality original. Hollywood specializes now in creating the least offensive, and/or controversial product possible, and it usually has all the passion of a car commercial.
  My reasons for giving the movie a ""1 star"" rating?
 1. The original was made at a time when real tension existed between the U.S. and Russia.  That anxiety over armed conflict between the two is minimal at this point, and not on the radar screens of the vast majority of Americans.  Basically, it's not timely.
 2.  Aspects of the original are changed for no apparent reason, other than to make the film possibly less offensive to some groups.  Example?  In the first film, most of the invaders were Cuban.  North Koreans are not likely to feel incensed at the release of this turd though, owing to the fact that it will never air in their country, except in the context of torture possibly.  Also, you can't help noticing the ""wolverteens"" were ""diversified"" to make it more ""modern"".
  3.  As is common now, the cast is made up of skinny jean wearing hipsters, that look like they have spent considerable time in the hair and makeup department minutes before filming.  What little dirt you see on them, looks applied.  If you want realism, wouldn't it make sense for the characters to look a little more ragged?
  4.  The characters are incredibly generic, and the acting is flat.
  5.  The action was cartoonish.  Surprisingly, in real life, people can't outrun explosions or bullets.  I think they used some old ""roadrunner"" episodes as a technical reference.

  If you wanted to make the film more politically correct, for starters you could make the bad guys target a strategic iphone  supply in the U.S.  That would be the most plausible scenario for young people taking up arms. Texted by main character-""OMG, they want our phooooonnnnnneeesss!  LOL"".  Also, they could outfit our heroes with rapid fire social justice dispensers (a gun is too offensive, and it kinda looks like a penis too) that leave the baddies cowering from it's high intensity, anti-patriarchy, guilt and shame waves.  Poor guys would be reduced to dishing with their female friends on Saturday night about some hottie/ bad boy, while secretly pining for them.  ""You're such a good friend (insert North Korean soldier name here), I'm lucky to have you"".  Some other memorable lines from the film might be: ""I hid some skinny jeans in a recycled paper bag under the manhole....er...ummm.. I mean the drainage system cover equally accessible regardless of gender, religion, race, and/or political leaning"".  Pretty catchy huh?
  Unfortunately, I don't see this idiotic trend ending anytime soon.  The real red invasion has been occurring for decades, and it's ideological.",1415059200,11,2818,4.9423076923076925

5393377,3,B00A7MSQRK,"Well, it sure is not the original by any means and the characters are a shadow of the ones in the original. The best characters in the remake are the Marines that come looking for the Wolverines help. Chris Hemsworth's character is OK in this remake, but Josh Peck of Nickelodeon fame is a poor cast as his brother. Unlike a vengeful Charlie Sheen, he is winey, self absorbed, and petulant most times. All he seems to care about is his girlfriend and himself, the rest of the world be damned, until those around him pay the ultimate price for his behavior. The other characters just have the same names as the original, but never develop as Lea Thompson or Jennifer Gray's characters did.
As for the general movie, I could see this possibly happening with China, but North Korea? Give me a break! North Korea has nowhere near the logistics to remotely pull something like this off! Russia and China are the only two countries with sheer volume of military troops to implement this, even with a EMP disruption. I heard that they originally wrote this as China, but changed it to North Korea for political correctness to not offend the Chinese, who now own us economically. The other discrepancy is that veterans and gun owning Americans would die fighting for this country, than give up without resistance to any and all occupying countries! The original Red Dawn had the primus of being a total national invasion of WWIII proportions, which made a lot more sense.

5393446,4,B00A7MSQRK,"If you are looking for an action packed movie with a story line that keeps you watching and is only rated PG-13, then Red Dawn would be a movie worth watching. Starting with a small town football game Matt Eckert played by Josh Peck leads his team as the game begins to end. Although they lose, you start to get a hint of his personality. As the movie progresses you begin to see those characteristics play a crucial roll. After the game the power mysteriously turns off. Matt arrives home to his brother Jed played by Chris Hemsworth. Immediately you can sense the tension, and the next day is when all hell breaks loose.
 First things first, this remake of Red Dawn is not like the original in 1984. Obviously the name is the same, and the same basic concept of war on our home front. Besides this the enemy was changed from the Soviet Union to North Korea. This significant change might seem minor to some but as I thought about it, the size difference of the Soviet Union and North Korea isn't comparable. How could a small country like North Korea infiltrate the entire United States?
 Josh Peck, who is known for the kids show Drake and Josh, did a mediocre job in this film. Not once did he strike me as a fearless leader or war hero like his character, Matt Eckert, was meant for. Many times during the movie I felt, Josh Peck was forcing his character and didn't feel natural with the necessities or the role.  On the other hand Chris Hemsworth playing Jed Eckert, did a terrific job as the leader of the American fighting group Wolverines. Like most of his roles you can tell he felt comfortable in the leadership position. This movie probably wouldnt have been nearly as good without him.
 Director Dan Bradley developed the movie quite well. It begins harmless with just hints of what might happen like the lights going out, to horrific events that we all hope never occurs. As the movie progresses I began to wonder where the time went. From scene to scene there was never a time frame; this made you wonder how long did they had to plan each of their attacks. Besides that little detail I thought the movie kept me watching and had me interested the entire time. There are parts that you just don't anticipate.
 As a person who knows how guns operate and has used them, this movie is unbelievably unrealistic. I think I counted two to three times someone reloaded their gun out of the whole movie. The kids who are apart of the Wolverines look like they haven't touched a gun before. Not just the kids, but I felt like the North Koreans couldn't hit anything if they were 10 feet away. I know this is like most movies, but I expect in this day and age of cinematography they could do better.
  Music is a crucial part of every action packed movie. In this thriller, I didn't notice the music much, but it was defiantly there. Assisting the movie by giving suspense and giving the viewer a feel for the emotions of the characters. Nonetheless music doesnt make or break a movie for me.

While it does mimic the original, there are original thoughts and action scenes: enough to get me hooked almost immediately to see how things would be different.

Things are different but the premise is the same.

We cached canned goods in the woods, stashed slingshots in our backpacks, prepping for that inevitable day that the Russians invaded. It made us fear--and WISH--for the day they came. Looking back at that film, there was a a lot of smart, realpolitik dialogue that I never grasped in my youth. The remake has nothing of that. The premise is ridiculous now, and not just because I'm no longer subject to the anti-Russian propaganda of the 80s. The acting is just okay, despite having some actors that have produced strong work. There's even been better remakes than this (the Australian flick ""Tomorrow, When the War Began""). I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because at least the producers realized how bad it was and re-shot/reworked it for years before they gave up and finally released it. Also, I figure the current generation of 11-14 year olds might find this movie as good as I found the original when I was their age. But only if they've got lower standards.",1409616000,,1112,4.565

I didn't much care for the opening act, they seemed to dwell on the fact that they were high school kids a lot more than I would have liked.  I also didn't much care for the actor that played Matty.  Those are about the only areas where I have to say that the original was much better.  However, the remake seems to be a much more coherent in the fact that there was actually a reason for Jed to be in charge; all of their actions made more sense in advancing the plot, it wasn't just ""We're gonna go hit an armored column;"" and they actually provided a reason for the enemy to be able to sneak in through the defenses.  And of course, it is a different time, and therefore a different bad guy; North Korea replaces the Nicaraguans and Cubans, and the Russians are still there and still don't do s***.  I thought it was a good touch that all of the Korean's armored vehicles had American flags on them, signifying that they stole the vehicles, they didn't just show up.  And rewatching the original, I noticed that the girls were stereotypical love sick wusses that are next to useless in a fight (I'm not butthurt, and I'm not trying to make a social point, I just noticed it and wish that it was better in that regard), this wasn't the case for the remake.",1409529600,,1431,4.235294117647059

5393533,2,B00A7MSQRK,"This is a fairly routine action film whose premise is far-fetched and highly improbable. A surprise invasion of the United States by North Korean forces shocks the residents of a midwest town. In an early sequence of the film, paratroopers descend on the town en masse, shoot innocent people, and take charge.

However, rather than attempting to destroy army bases, air fields, or military targets, they seem content to pick on defenseless and therefore non-threatening civilians. A small group of young people band together under the leadership of Iraq veteran Jed Eckert (Chris Hemsworth) to become resistance fighters, known as Wolverines. Joining Jed are his brother Matt (Josh Peck), Robert Kitner (Josh Hutcherson) and a small but determined group.

The original 1984 film of the same name is superior. There is far less swagger among the young principals (including Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, and Charlie Sheen). Though both films present hysterical invasion fantasies, the earlier picture's young stars are more appealing.

Okay, I will simply highlight the things about the movie that make it suck COMPARED to the original.  It just fell WAAAAY short.

The characters don't match in a very wrong sort of way.  The original has a main character, Jed, but in the remake the main character is back and forth with the brother.  This leaves you trying to connect with someone, and you can't.  The original Jed was also Patrick Swayze, who could actually act.  Chris Hemsworth CAN'T.  That, sadly is the main issue.  If his lines were BBQ he would be dry burnt ends, and Swayze would be sweet and tender meaty ribs.

The action was good, but not good enough to cover for so many badly copied scenes.  The traitor in the remake was not really there.  The scene where the father has his moment is so far and away inferior, that it was a disgrace.  The scene from the orignal where the kids talk to dad is the defining moment in the movie, it MAKES the movie.  No such moment existed in the remake.

The deaths of the characters is also just pulled off really badly.  They were non events.

The girls in the remake are overly glamorous, and cannot fight or act.

The humor was also not there, this movie has absolutely no really funny moments, not really one.

The scenery is back and forth from urban to forest with no transitions, but it is mostly urban and uninteresting.  There are no slow moments.",1408147200,,1421,4.413127413127413

For the effective communication of that message, I give it four stars. Though evil seem to triumph, it shall never purge from the hearts of every good man the longing for freedom.

5393542,3,B00A7MSQRK,"Red Dawn, 1984 film

The movie begins with news of political revolts in Europe and South America! What will happen to America? We see a small city. In September leaves are turning color and falling. [Symbolism?] There is a statue to the Rough Riders [the last Volunteer Corps in the US Army]. A teacher talks about the history of the Huns. Outside they see parachutes falling! The teacher goes outside and is shot dead! Automobiles crash in the parking lot! [Is this believable?] Teenage students grab supplies (food, arms, and ammunition) and head off to the woods. Can this well-regulated militia resist a professional army? [Refer to Europe in WW II.] These invader speak Spanish. They will gather Form 4473s to identify all owners of firearms in order to confiscate them. Never shoot twice as this allows the enemy to locate you.

The boys shoot a deer for meat and open cans of food. [Product placement?] When they run short they go into town. They notice changes. The KGB are looking for you! A lot of people were taken away to re-education centers. Its all gone says one man. You cant afford to cry. Go away before they find you. They learn about Free America. [Canned goods in glass should be on high shelves in case they fall.] One couple offers shelter and food. Horses don't need oil and gasoline. Radio Free America sends messages and songs. Things are different now. An enemy patrol runs into trouble, arrows and bullets. Citizens dig graves then are machine gunned. The resistance has captured AK-47s now. A girl delivers a package to a tank crew. The resistance attacks enemy troops, and leave a message. [Is the wolverine a state animal?]

There is an explosion in a club. [How different from terrorists?] There is an explosion in a club. [How different from terrorists?] One American pilot parachutes down and joins their group. He tells them what happened. Illegal immigrants were disguised combatants. They won't use nuclear weapons now. He tells them who is on out side! [There is a surprise.] Millions are starving. Snow falls. The Colonel gives lessons in military tactics. Whats a flank? There are attacks. The enemy is their supply line. An enemy tank approaches. There are casualties. More enemy troops arrive. A hunter can kill wolverines. The fighting goes on. One member is accused of treason. Will the good guys win in the end?

This is an exciting and colorful story for teenagers of all ages. Wars are waged for loot [land, people, oil or coal, etc.]. What does this small town have to offer except as an example that doesnt seem realistic? Many of the examples seem to be derived from WW II in Europe. [Do you know what happened when US forces were sent to Central American Banana Republics or the Phillipines a century ago? This is a dramatic story, but I don't think this will ever happen. [Im an optimist, are you?] Could a few city teenagers do so well? They didn't play The Eve of Destruction at all.",1407974400,,2937,4.73046875

Action (underdogs take on big bad guys)

North Korea,  with Russian support,  take over the US east coast. A small band of teenagers lead by an ex - marine build an uprising rebellion to the foreign occupation.

Worth watching?:
Yes, but save it for a night when you have nothing else to do.

Comments:
I don't watch enough TV to be current on movie releases, unless it's one everybody's talking about, but I have never heard of this movie before so I wasn't really sure what to expect.  You just never know since so many of these smaller titles (and many big named titles for that matter) are a complete waste of time. However,  this movie is an exception.

I can't think of anything I didn't like about it, just that it didn't do or say anything the original didn't already do.

I was wrong. It was worse than the original on almost every level.

When I heard about this re-make I was a bit hesitant at first and at the time it seemed to have been held up in post production (whatever that means) for what seemed like forever. When it was finally released my curiosity built up to the point where I decided that while I certainly wouldn't pay theater prices to see it I would give it a whirl when it came on PPV. Kind of wish I hadn't.

 I was a huge fan of the original. Probably seen it 20 times throughout my life and can dang near quote it line for line. It was like I could develop a certain rapport with the characters of the original but this re-make just didn't seem to recapture the magic of the 1984 release. The characters were just 'blah' with no real development or depth.

I'm fully aware that the powers that be in Hollywood have seemingly ran out of original ideas but with the technology we have available today this movie could have been everything the original was and maybe even more. Instead it's another forgettable
re-make/re-launch hastily hacked together. I'd much rather watch ""Tomorrow, When the War Began"" or just the 1984 ""Red Dawn"".",1404086400,,1131,4.480582524271845

I did find it interesting that they made the main character a solider this time around instead of the more survivalist of the first one - definitely shows the difference in attitudes between a post Vietnam era movie and post 911 movie.

5393747,3,B00A7MSQRK,As a child of the 1980's the original Red Dawn was right on the mark with what we felt as a society then. The movie as originally planned wuth China as the invader made more since than the North Koreans who could not undertake such a venture. The movie was changed by Golden Mayer from China to North Korea for pc reason' s because China objected. So sad that we live in a world now and are run by folks who care about what a dictatorship thinks. Russia in the 1980's had a plan to do what the original movie portrayed. However the generals in tge Soviet Union decided not to because not only would they have fighting the military and police here but also almost every citizen thanks to the second amendment.

Then again, the only reason I got it was because I found it cheap and Josh Hutcherson is in it.  Not even he can save this film for me though.

I'll be blunt: the performances feel stilted.  The characters aren't even one-dimensional, they have no dimensions to speak of, and they're completely forgettable.  Honestly, when people die in this film my reaction was one of, ""Huh?  Someone got killed?  I don't even remember that character.  What was their name again?  Did they even have one?""  Speaking of character, there is no character development to actually make me care about the cardboard cutouts I'm forced to watch for 90 minutes.  The action is sub-par at best.  The storyline is too absurd to be taken seriously and takes itself too seriously to be funny.  The climax feels like it was ripped from a video game that was probably way more fun and interesting than this film.  In the end you're just left feeling cold and used.  Emphasis on the used.  Even the $4 I spent to own this feels like way too much.  I was robbed.  And I'm not happy.

Bottom line: if you want Red Dawn, watch the original.  Use the remake as a drink coaster.  At least you'll get some satisfaction out of it that way.",1398643200,7,1368,4.409638554216867

you can tell what will happen in the intire movie. Oh and by the way they only use the Mustang with the mini gun at the end of the movie.
The ""climax"" of the storyline is worse then a guys first time. Oh wow a head shot.... soooooo original.

They also leave a ton of lose ends to the story, and make spetchnaz look like national guard troops.
Btw most marine units don't have suppressed weapons, especially retired marines.

Overall DO NOT EVEN HIT THE PLAY BUTTON. was a waste of a hour and a half of my life.

which is another thing 1 hour and 30 some minutes with a 5 plus min credits.  Only kids movies are that short and this is no kids movie.

Simple and watchable. Not to heavy on character development and all the other issues but I wasn't expecting Academy awards here. 1 surprise at the end that I didn't see coming while everything else pretty straight up.

However, it's never fully realized and sets a thin foundation to build on and overall the plot just doesn't make sense. The original was entertaining, but it also made a statement about loss of innocence, the main characters journey and experience is a metaphor for the country as whole and carries weight without being overly political.

This version doesn't bother to develop the plot or characters enough to be compeling and support the film makers obvious political point of view.

Why did the invasion force in the first place?  I guess in the first five minutes there was a lame attempt at setting up the whole world situation but I couldn't buy it.  I suspected it was going to be bad when I observed the lame graphics of the invasion.  The plot was weak and there was no ending.

5393895,4,B00A7MSQRK,"There is no doubt that the movie is not an award winning blockbuster, but for a lazy Friday night Red Dawn is definitely a suitable action flick option.

While there is no an outstanding plotline, I believe that the interesting mixture of actors/actresses that were cast for this film helped to bump it out of the realm of obscurity and into the domain of something worth watching. I mean Chris Hemsworth does win the People's Choice Awards for Favorite Action Movie Star so you know he's doing something right with this film.

I also believe that comparing it to the original is not too fair as they both do separate things extremely well. I think this second shot of Red Dawn definitely brings the explosions, the action, and the fun to the plot while the first focuses more on what the story is about.

Bottom line I would say is give it a shot. You should definitely enjoy this little closet action film.

5393905,3,B00A7MSQRK,"For a movie that is supposed to be a remake of a 1984 Cult Classic it's doesn't stand up, but it does have enough to stand by itself as a good action movie.

I think one of the reason it did so bad was the fact that the studio pushed it back until the actors and actresses in it were known to the mainstream community hurt it whereas the 1984 one had started the careers of the the actors and actresses in it this movie could have done the same for these young stars because the movie was well acted, even though  it reminded me of the video game Homefront.

Tip to the producers if you've going to make a remake it's best to watch the original and figure out how you can tell the story better.

Terrible acting (I'm looking at you Josh Peck), no character development what so ever, bad pacing, tons of plot holes, and very poorly film with way too much shaky cam. I can suspend disbelief in films, but when a film ask me to suspend my disbelief even further after already accepting the incredibly implausible and dumb plot by doing more things that simply just don't make sense, it seems that the writers just believe that the audience is stupid and won't question anything and that pisses me off. I could've rolled with it if it was being played as an over-the-top silly B-Movie, but it's being played off as a dead serious war film that feels more like watching watching two rival gangs fight than the two opposing forces that are presented to us. The only positive thing I can say about it is that Chris Hemsworth was at least trying with what he had to work with and the film never slowed down despite the poorly pacing. The only way I could ever recommend someone to watch this is if they want to watch a film that's laughably bad. Another positive I can say about it is that for the first hour, me and my buddies were laughing non-stop at how terrible the film was, but after about an hour, there really is no more material to make fun off anymore and it becomes a pain to sit through the last 30 minutes that lead up to the incredibly bad ending that tryings to be an emotional cheap-shot to get the audience to feel sad despite the fact that we don't feel anything for these characters since they are all undeveloped and mostly unlikeable. So even for laughs, it's a hard recommendation. Save your time and money! Avoid this horrible remake at all cost and just rent the original.",1395273600,,1787,4.484662576687117

Call me biased, but I'm a product of the 70's and 80's and I absolutely LOVED the original movie throughout my childhood.  I appreciate the attempt at including a few of the more memorable original scenes, but this newer version fell extremely short of its predecessor...even with all of the advancements in movie technology and special effects.  The acting is terrible and completely unbelievable...the casting director should be ashamed.  I'll admit it is difficult to replace the original ""brat pack"", but they could have done a heckuva lot better....Josh Peck as Matty, really?  Dude doesn't hold a candle to Charlie Sheen.  His ""acting"" is atrocious.  Hemsworth was just alright, but I'll never see him as anything but Thor (in his defense, he did have to step into some pretty big shoes - or rather, small ass kicking dance shoes).  And I'm sorry, but ""Peta"" is no C. Thomas Howell shouting the trademark ""WOLVERINES!""  Heck, he doesn't even fit the role of Peta that well.

There was not much swearing (in comparison to most action movies these days), and there was no sexual content other than kissing and a joke about a porn stash. It makes for a good family movie, if you have older kids who can understand what is going on, and won't be scared by it. I gave it 4 stars because of Josh Peck's acting.

The original came out during The Cold War and the possibility of an actual invasion still had some possibility (even if it were remote).  The odds of North Korea successfully invading US soil is not believable, so the movie suffers as a result.  Instead of remaking the original, they should have treated this as more of a sequel.

Until stated outright the only hint was a odd mix of Russian and Spanish language used by the invaders).  Anyway...we thoroughly enjoyed watching this remake.  It's not just a remake, but the same story presented in a different way.  We watched both back-to-back (I gave a different kind of review for the original version if anybody's interested in looking that up).  We were totally absorbed all the way through both.

The problem with this movie as a remake though is...it's only an hour and a half where as the original is 2 hours.  All the character development that didn't happen in this version....well, it's gotta be in that missing 20 or so minutes. It really is the typical mediocre action movie...all guns a blazing but no meaningful interactions. At the end you really don't even care what happened to anyone....at least I didn't.  The original is far better for sure. This one is just okay and would do in a pinch if you can't sleep in the middle of the night and it's the only thing on.",1393286400,,751,4.201388888888889

It tries to touch on some important parts and story lines of the original movie but it just takes a left turn near the end and changes the plot.

I liked the concept of Red Dawn. Instead of Russians in the original, we have North Koreans. But it could happen. Not likely but neither are zombies.
The acting wasn't totally terrible. And of course it has Thor, so I always enjoy a little Hemsworth in my movies.
A slimmed down kids actor is the hero of the story and that was pretty cool when I realized who it was.

God forbid that our country should be attacked or occupied by a foreign military, but I would like to imagine us Americans forming a resistance and fighting the attackers with everything we have in the theoretical scenario that the unthinkable ever occurred.

5394050,2,B00A7MSQRK,"John Milius's original was no classic, but at least it had style, great locations, and an almost believable plot. This slapdash remake, whose release was long delayed, looks like it was something for Chris Hemsworth to do when he had a couple of weeks off from making blockbusters. In this remake, the Chinese originally replaced the Russians as the villains, but the studio worried about offending a billion or so potential ticket buyers, so the film went back into the editing and special effects rooms to change the villains to North Koreans. They invade Spokane for reasons never made entirely clear. I mean, who wants Spokane? Was Seattle too hard a target? These notorious and draconian control freaks (in real life) set up what appears to be a fairly haphazard occupation, where the city streets are still full of cars and Subway is still making those awful sandwiches. Oh, some people are put into prison camps, but the teenage girl prisoners apparently still have access to hairdressers and makeup. The Wolverines move about the city with very little trouble, acquiring weapons and explosives with almost no effort. The North Korean soldiers are all the same bad shots as the enemy in Rambo movies, while our heroes - relatively untrained teenagers - are deadly accurate. The change of villains must have affected the final cut, and no doubt a lot of footage was also removed to quicken the film's still ponderous pace, so the film sort of jumps around. The Wolverines are chased from their rabbit hole by the Koreans, escape into the woods at night, but then build a campfire. Really? A Spetsnaz counter insurgency officer suddenly appears, disappears, then briefly reappears later in the film. One assumes the major portion of his performance is on the cutting room floor, unlike William Smith's portrayal of a similar character in the original, one of the highlights of the film. Also missing is the original's most powerful scene, where the group must decide whether to execute a member, their friend since childhood, who betrayed them to save his family.
Milius had the good sense to stage his film in and around an isolated town in the West, which not only offered great scenery and a logical reason for the occupation (a confluence of roads), but gave the movie a real sense of his heroes' isolation and desperate situation behind enemy lines. It also made the Wolverine's hit and run raids on convoys and outposts plausible. The dense cityscape in this movie makes these Wolverine's exploits simply unbelievable and offers no iconic images. Milius's film was full of them. If you must watch ""Red Dawn"", go with the original.",1393027200,,2641,4.923766816143497

5394068,3,B00A7MSQRK,"As a child of the 80's, I grew up with the original Red Dawn which had the added realism benefit of the cold war spectre hanging over society.  In that regard, I came into this movie not expecting much and wondering whether I would walk away disappointed or pleasantly suprised.  In this instance, I was neither.  This version fell right in the middle.  The story follows closely to the original with some new twists, but generally it paid close homage to the original.  The movie flows with a good pace and the cinematography is fairly decent, but the character development is forced and unrealistic in places.  Overall, it was a good popcorn flick to waste away a lazy or snowy Saturday afternoon when there is no college football to keep you entertained.",1392681600,,757,4.696969696969697

5394074,4,B00A7MSQRK,It was a pretty good movie.  Better than what I expected it to be. Would recommend it to other people.,1392595200,,102,4.1
5394075,4,B00A7MSQRK,Appears to be a low budget film with OK actors.  Could have expanded some of the later events (vague so as to not be a spoiler.),1392595200,,128,3.923076923076923
5394076,3,B00A7MSQRK,Josh Peck is a douche and single handedly ruined this movie!  No the story is not that believable but its hollywood people get over it!  Josh Peck should have never been cast as the brother he should have been cast as a korean that gets beaten over the head.,1392595200,,258,4.244897959183674
5394077,2,B00A7MSQRK,Not very convincing. Never felt much connection with the characters. Not terribly suspenseful. There are better action movies out there.,1392595200,,136,5.85
5394078,4,B00A7MSQRK,"Was a teen when the first one was released. It was OK at the time.  I think I may like this one better.  Pretty well done from start to finish. Good casting, story, and FX. Not an Oscar winner, but not a waste of time either.",1392595200,,225,3.869565217391304
5394079,1,B00A7MSQRK,might have been a pretty ok movie if it was made to be its own movie and not a remake of a classic. ;) Wolverines!!!,1392595200,,116,3.68

5394083,1,B00A7MSQRK,"I would give this zero stars if I could. The producers of this movie took an interesting premise from a very good, if a little flawed, 80's classic and added stupid Hollywood action trope. You've seen it in a hundred other horrible movies...silly premise (steal the blackbox), gratuitous explosions, bad acting, etc. If zero stars were possible then that's what I would rate this movie. 93 minutes of my life wasted that I can never get back.",1392422400,,442,4.753246753246753

5394086,1,B00A7MSQRK,Awful remake. Nothing remotely interesting about this movie. Didn't care who lived or died. Totally unrealistic situations. Only redeeming factor was Chris Hemsworth!,1392422400,,166,6.260869565217392

5394093,2,B00A7MSQRK,Poor redo of the original.  No substance or depth to the characters.  The actor playing Matt was awful.  Urban setting was a good change.,1392336000,,137,4.625
5394094,4,B00A7MSQRK,Entertaining.  With watching but wouldn't buy it.  Nice switch of some of the characters. I would watch a second time.,1392336000,,118,4.85
5394095,2,B00A7MSQRK,"This one wasn't really worth a re-do in the first place.  I'd forgotten I'd seen the first one; now I know why.  Maybe we will see some of the faces again in better movies, but really, there were no stand-out performances, just the usual pretty faces.  Wouldn't recommend it to a friend.",1392249600,,287,4.480769230769231
5394096,2,B00A7MSQRK,"This movie was difficult to watch.  The screenplay was choppy and the film felt very rushed from start to finish.  You don't really get a good feel for the characters and the result is that they all sort of blend together. The folks making this movie should have taken more cues from the first film because that is what worked and made the film so relevant for its time and today.  Even when scenes from the first movie were used, they lost all of the impact and were less meaningful as a result, ( The deer scene and Jed Eckert's dad being killed).  The fighting lacked a real depth because you never saw the wolverines on the battlefield.  It all seemed to take place in a couple of square blocks.  Do yourself a favor and stick to watching the first version.",1392249600,,761,4.361702127659575
5394097,4,B00A7MSQRK,"I can't really compare this with the original. They both are fairly different takes on the same premise, and both are good in their own ways. Just don't watch the one with an expectation or prejudice for the other. Let them stand on their own. Both are down-home patriotic type movies, showing classic take-no-garbage American attitude.",1392249600,,336,5.017857142857143

5394103,3,B00A7MSQRK,Not Even Close To Being As Good As The Original. acting Was Mediocre At Best. Jed's Brother Was A Terrible Actor!,1392163200,,113,4.428571428571429
5394104,1,B00A7MSQRK,Poor acting by this entire cast that bring no emotion. The original RED DAWN  was far more superior than this refried version. Not worth it.,1392163200,,140,4.6
5394105,5,B00A7MSQRK,"I think that red dawn(the new one) is an amazing movie. I think it's amazing because it has all this action and you don't know what's going to happen next. Honestly, I would recommend this to all of my friends if they liked action movies. I think that if anybody was in the mood for an action movie on like family movie night, this is definitely the movie for that night. It would also be the movie for any other night, too. Red Dawn will make you want to watch this movie every night. (to me). This movie will be very enjoyable even in the first 5 seconds.",1392076800,,557,4.166666666666667

5394122,2,B00A7MSQRK,"The movie is decent except for every part with Josh Peck in it.  Sadly, he is far too much of the movie. I thought for the longest time he was trying to play a mentally handicapped character and I was quite offended.

5394123,1,B00A7MSQRK,I guess I am old school. When I see a movie I really like I have a hard time watching a remake as the plots and characters are all different. This one turned me off right from the get go with the shots of Obama giving speeches (can' stand the guy). The rest of the movie was all down hill. It really did not make much sense. They made this taking place in present times. How would all of this military equipment get past our present radar systems and warning systems in place. I would not watch it again.,1391904000,,504,4.101010101010101

5394128,1,B00A7MSQRK,"During the cold war it was believable the the Soviets might try to invade. In this remake set in modern times it is just too far fetched for North Korea or any nation to do so.

5394130,2,B00A7MSQRK,"Chris Hemsworth tries his best to rescue this movie as well as the city of Spokane, but the plot is simply unbelievable.  Its nice to think patriotism isn't completely dead yet.  In an age of Blackhawk helicopters with infrared sensors and facial recognition cameras on every street corner in every city, the concept of teenagers escaping the Korean army by running through the woods and alleys just doesn't cut it.  First the Korean army is presented as being able to electronically disable the entire US military and invade as far inland as Spokane, and then it cannot find teens hiding in the woods or recognize them sneaking through the city. Watch it pure fantasy, not as a fictional blue print for dealing with an invasion.",1391817600,,729,4.816

5394135,4,B00A7MSQRK,"Pretty good story line. However, not very believable to have North Korea taking over part of the U.S. You really have to throw out your common sense to think America could not repel such an attack.

Considering the economics today and how much we as a country owe to other countries, it would not surprise me that something like this could happen. (Don't want to spoil the movie).

Too many people approach problems this way from George Zimmerman to George Washington to Curious George....

Were there big explosions an action sequences? Yes!

Did it jump and skip around the plot so much that it made no sense? Also, yes!

We watched it with our kids because ""that kid from the Hunger Games is in it."" I thought maybe we were just upset with it because we were comparing it to the original. When the movie was over, the kids referred to the movie as ""awful"" ""horrible"" and the oldest said, ""I want those two hours back.""

You feel like you have to give it a chance and something happens to pull you back in, but don't waste your time. It doesn't get better.",1391299200,,683,4.190839694656488

I thnk its a good thing, it is the way they envisioned it. The problem with completely copying a movie like this, is you would get people saying they shouldn't have done it. But as for how well the movie was done, if you look hard enough you can find flaws in anything.

I love this movie because of the courage and patriotism it shows for their home country and fighting for what they believe in. In my mind it is a great movie because it gives a certain level of encouragement to support OUR country. it showsholding true to what you believe in. I love this country even with problems it faces both externally and internally. I would fight for it any day, I would hope others would do the same. Hopefully my message comes across. I don't look to insult or offend.

Any body who says this country is not a great country and hates it.

Yea, the Koreans land in Spokane and the head guy while taking over the town decides he has nothing more pressing to do then personally drive to a cabin in the country to find a couple of teenagers. Clueless teens who become military experts in a few days, I might add. Of course he must execute the hero's dad in the process to confirm he truly is the bad guy - in case there is any doubt. The USA military is never shown and explained away with two sentences of lame dialogue an hour into the film. The teen insurgents call themselves 'Wolverines' - a name which obviously was chosen to strike fear in the hearts of everyone not living in Ann Arbor.

The explosions and fighting were fun to watch. I am glad this movie ended differently than did the first Red Dawn movie. I am also glad the new Red Dawn has a different story line from the first Red Dawn. If the story line had not been different then there would have been no reason to watch this one.

The acting was OK, Not great.

If you want to watch a fun movie with a good amount of shoot'm up and explosions then you are likely going to enjoy this movie like I did. No it is not a 5 star movie but it was worth watching. Especially, when you can watch the movie free when you are a member of Amazon Prime.",1390694400,,932,3.9

It doesn't try to remake the original, and goes its own way. The ending does leave you hanging a little.
There are some unexpected turns with the characters, but this is a survival movie, however hard to believe as Red Dawn is. Suspend your disbelief and you may enjoy it. A better, more detailed and logical story was required to really pull it off.",1390348800,,756,4.4071428571428575

When the characters in this movie do exactly what the ""insurgents"" in those countries are doing, it's okay because they're American...? Too much hypocrisy.

Where the movie lost me was when they cast a punk that looks like McLovin from Superbad as little Matty Eckert.  They would have been better off casting Christopher Mintz-Plasse, at least he is likable.

The oldest man in the group is in the US military and has been serving overseas so he has the instinct to lead the group and fight back.

This is not a remake of the '84 classic. It wasn't intended to be. It's a stand alone retelling using a current backdrop as its stage for retelling a well written and emotional tale of loss and triumph. And it's done well. Not exceptionally well, but neither is it sub par in any sense. While there are some areas that might have been done ""better"", I certainly at no time felt that I was not watching a first rate production. If you enjoy this type of story, try to leave your expectations someplace at the 30 second mark into the film, then sit back and let the telling unfold, and enjoy.",1389657600,,739,4.481481481481482

Batman & Superman movies are being remade left and right; that I'm tired of, but this movie kept my interest, left me wanting more, and allover was well put together.

One boy single handedly destroyed any hope of a watchable action film  This boy's name is Josh Peck and he wants to show you his ""oh face"" at every moment, for every emotion and in every scene.

If you just take the new Red Dawn at face value, which is just a constant barrage of explosions and one-liners and repetitive action scenes, then you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for deeper meaning, then I would watch the older Cold War era red Dawn . There is just no feel of patriotism in this movie. Yeah, it's cool that the antagonists are the North Koreans and Russians, no surprise. However, the clunky dialogue and really unlikable characters make this movie harder to digest then it should be .
 I know it's always ill-advised to try and remake a classic American movie , and the new Red Dawn fails miserably in this attempt. As I mentioned earlier, if you just take it face value then the movie is actually quite good. If you try to find a deeper meaning prepare to be let down.",1389225600,,909,4.410714285714286

Chris Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson do a really good job, but Josh Peck doesn't belong anywhere near this film.  I found his performance took me out of any scene that focused on him.  His delivery is wooden and he always seem to have some teen angst scowl on his face,  which doesn't pair well with his whiny voice.

The bottom line back then was, don't spend your money to watch it and watch it for free only if there really is nothing else on - or you don't have a VCR for a rental.

There are a few spots where things get over-the-top, but all-in-all, it's a pretty tight story with decent performances.",1389052800,,397,4.410958904109589

This is a transparent attempt by someone who probably felt they just couldn't leave a message out there that they did not agree with.  It is sad that most of the ratings here are politically motivated and not based on the quality of the remake.  If you have not seen the original, and watched this first, maybe it would have more legs.  However, having seen the first one, this thing is not worthy of a single star.",1388534400,,812,4.52054794520548
5394485,3,B00A7MSQRK,"Wasn't bad, but I'm judging it against the original, which is always a hazard with a remake. If you are gonna do a remake and you plan to gonna modernize it, you still need to follow the original storyline better.",1388534400,,213,4.35
5394486,3,B00A7MSQRK,"It wasn't terrible. It was fairly predictable, but entertaining, nonetheless. Would have liked to see more realism in the scenes when they were in town hiding from the infiltrators.",1388534400,,181,5.275862068965517
5394487,4,B00A7MSQRK,It was just as good as the first Red Dawn and a frightening thought of what could happen.  I enjoyed it and I love Chris Hemsworth,1388534400,,130,4.0

5394489,5,B00A7MSQRK,"Yes, it's an action movie and it draws plenty from its predecessor. This new Red Dawn had a more believable premise in how a bunch of high school kids could make an effort to fight off an invading foreign force though, and even built on the story of the previous movie by taking a little time at the beginning to at least give us insights into Jed and Matty's relationship as brothers. I would watch this movie again.",1388534400,,417,4.358974358974359
5394490,2,B00A7MSQRK,"Red Dawn (the new one) fails to pull the viewer in. The entire movie is spent suspending ones imagination for want of the movie to be good. All in all, good idea, poorly executed.",1388534400,,179,4.294117647058823

5394494,5,B00A7MSQRK,"This movie was so amazing!  It takes something that everyone has wondered about, or joked about, and makes you think about what would happen if it finally happened?  Personally, I think that we've already been taken over by the Chinese, we just are too stupid to know it!  But the movie was great, and a really good moral.",1388448000,,322,4.517241379310345

5394499,3,B00A7MSQRK,"This was a decent flick, though the story is a bit convoluted. Chris Hemsworth (aka Thor) was the lead, and he put in a good effort as an military person on leave back home. His brother was pretty decent too. You'll see a lot of guns and bullets and bombs, but not much of a plot. Still, there were enough tiny twists in the plot, and poignant (sad) moments to get you to root for the good guys against the bad guys.",1388448000,,416,4.085365853658536

5394520,3,B00A7MSQRK,"The first one was much better.  I hated the fact that they changed the enemy to the North Koreans.  It made the movie that much more unbelievable as the Chinese (the original bad guys) are more capable of this sort of invasion than the NKs.

This movie is not good enough to occupy your time with...to kill or waste time...yes, but you'd be better off doing fun things like standing in line for a flu shot, giving a cat a bath, changing a flat tire. The remake of Red Dawn is about as successful as Obamacare! This movie has action and that's all. Even by North Korean standards, this movie stinks...LONG time!!!",1388188800,,434,4.506329113924051

5394537,2,B00A7MSQRK,I enjoyed the first one because I'm that old. I don't understand how an American city can be over run with machinery and troops without any bombing before hand. You hear gun fire and the skies are full of chutes and roads full of troop carriers and tanks. I'd like to think we'd had fired off a few shots before opening the roads and say take our country please!,1388188800,,362,4.260869565217392

It was made at a time with the Soviet Union was still a real threat and the idea that the US could be invaded was somewhat plausible.

No, it can't!  Making an action movie period with just that is usually only decent.  It's like all they focus on is the pyrotechnics and the fire fights.  When making a remake, especially one that had an original cast like the 1984 version did, along with the story line, please Hollywood, make it just like the original or just don't make it at all!",1387929600,,520,4.421052631578948

In the original with the late Patrick Swayze, the Cubans with the help of the Russians invades the US. In the remake it's the North Koreans again with the help of the Russians. At least in the original the Cubans use Soviet era equipment. The North Koreans ride around in Humvees in the remake and there is no explanation of why. That being said the new version has many scenes of urban combat that are decent and the script differs greatly from the original.

It's on equal footing with the original in terms of implausibility.  North Korea invading is about as likely as Cuba.  Beyond that, the remake just speaks to a generation enamored with the stereotypical media portrayal of the Marine, and whose life skills don't stretch beyond raiding the folks' refrigerator.

I think I would have rather they made this as a new movie instead of trying to make it a 'remake'. How about.. North Korea Dawn?! EH? I should name movies.

I don't want to get into the details of why I enjoyed this (was it the purdy lady?), but I'd recommend watching this movie and to go into it without expectations and I have a feeling you'll enjoy it as much as I did.

OK lets suspend that disbelief and move on to somehow hacking in the power systems that exists on a standalone network to create a US wide power/communication outage. All this and the characters were able to get soda out of a fountain drink dispenser during a blackout.

The training vignette was as equally ridicules as the kids performed function checks and loud music played while the gained commando skills mysteriously though the main character sneaking up on them.

The love of one's country and the love of one's brother, is something that has gotten stronger and stronger the older i get. This second making of this movie, is easier to understand if you've watched the first movie that came out. Though different, it still has the same undertones, but helps you in the fact you feel you already know the brothers.  i encourage all that haven't watched the first, to watch it , then watch this current one.

The central premise is, then, absurd even by the very loose standards of the genre.

But that's just for starters. The script is cheesy beyond measure, featuring moronic flag-waving buddy speeches, an enemy so poorly fleshed-out that they may as well not exist, and a temporal logic that makes absolutely no sense. (A group of teens go from pimply and self-absorbed to crack insurgents in a single scene, for example.) Add in the standard Hollywood product placements everywhere, plus that fact that in the post-invasion wasteland the cast remains fresh-faced and well-groomed, and this is pure Awsom-o 2000, paint-by-numbers commercial gruel, and a poor job of it at that. It sat on the shelf for two years and likely would never have seen the light of day had not Chris Hemsworth's success as Thor not inspired the distributor to try to make a few bucks in DVD sales off of it.",1387238400,,1186,4.842364532019705

The concept is nice, but the execution was lacking.",1387152000,,460,4.7125

I heard that the original script had depicted the invaders coming from China, but that the Chinese government got wind of this and demanded a re-write.  Not sure that's true, but the opening scene showing the US debt chart seems to be a remnant of the original script.  The idea of the Chinese invading the US after accumulating too much of our debt is far fetched, but not as implausible as North Korea, a country that can't even manufacture its own cars.",1387152000,,615,4.473214285714286

The actors do a good job and the action scenes are well orchestrated - the kind that will make you want to see it again after a little time has passed. At first I didn't like the lead character who plays the rebellious and self-centered ex-quarterback, but he grows on you and turns out just fine. I'll let someone else give you all the high class analysis -- this is just a good movie who meets my main criterion of being re-watchable.

This movie was remade VERY nicely bringing the 80s movie up to modern standards without jeapordizing movie base...  The plot and actors of this movie were FAR more believable than the original one, and I have to say I actually prefer this one to the original hands down!!

I think it could have gone longer and covered more things, but it was certainly entertaining as it is.  The thing that annoyed me most was the main character HS kid from Drake and Josh... man, that guy is ANNOYING... but the rest is good enough that even he is tolerable.

5394763,1,B00A7MSQRK,"I cannot begin to tell you how bad this movie is.  I am not even going to compare it to the original because that would be far too painful and honestly, there isn't enough room for all of that to be written.  Let's start with the basics.  Do you feel anything for the characters.  Nope.  This is a movie about a bunch of pretty boys and girls playing what is essentially a live action video game.  They go from completely untrained civilians to hardened warriors after...wait for it.....the training montage.  I need to get one of those montages because I could sell it to the US military and make a fortune.  I mean why train a soldier for years when you can just fire up the montage when needed.  It is also very nice when the bad guys just line up in the open to be shot.  I guess they did not have a montage.  The chemistry between the characters was also exceedingly weak.  We get the forced dialogue here and there, but nothing of any value.  I saw more team building on The Expendables.  The other thing I had trouble with was how clean everybody was.  They are living in the woods, in caves, but everybody is always so well groomed.  Maybe there was a grooming montage that you can see in the Blu-Ray extras for the enhanced edition that they hopefully will never release.  Next we have plot holes you could drive a North Korean tank through.  The freedom fighters keep going in and out of the town without any papers and the bad guys never seem to catch on.  You know what.  I have already wasted enough digital ink on this review.  Do yourself a favor and watch the original and just leave this one alone.  If you liked this movie, then you should really see Battlefield Earth for a true masterpiece.",1386720000,,1710,4.3619047619047615

I'm pretty sure that version wouldn't be as good as I remember if I were to see it again, but as a kid I thought it was great and it can't be as bad as this stinker.

5394768,2,B00A7MSQRK,"The original is safe.  I almost gave it one star, but decided to raise it because of the cast.  Not a good movie.  The original fit the times.  The Cold War was alive.  Ronald Reagan was on TV telling us to be strong, I miss that comfort.  Ok, I was 12 years old.  This movie was out of place.  Made no sense.  I am all for temporary suspension of disbelief, but this was pushing it way to far.  Ok to play in the background while playing angry birds, but that is it.  Patrick Swayze RIP, the original while out there, is safe.  This is a movie all the cast did for a paycheck.  Good practice for their later work.",1386633600,,614,4.0588235294117645

Russians helping them or not helping? The story was shallow, shallow shallow and just plain bad. No development of characters that actually make you want to give a da** and root for them, Hemsworth and Peck do NOT make a good set of bros. Peck should stick to comedy, loved him in Drake and Josh, NOT in dramatic roles. This is the first one star I have EVER given a film. Just bad.",1386547200,,535,4.414141414141414

It had some really good scenes and some you could see they were preserving from the original, but besides the one or 2 preserved parts and the title, they are very different movies. This one was more about the wolverines and less about the people in town. A lot of things were quite predictable.

Liam Hemsworth is just all over everywhere nowadays, but he is as good in this film as anywhere else.

5394837,1,B00A7MSQRK,"Red Dawn is the story of a group of teenage resistance fighters during a North Korean invasion and occupation of the United States.  Go ahead and reread that first sentence.... North Korea, a nation that cannot feed it's own citizens, how the heck is it going to transport a massive invasion force across the Pacific.  It's just so implausible that it starts the movie off on a wrong foot. From there it only gets worse.

Chris Hemsworth isn't too bad, the rest of the actors vary from forgetable to awful, bottoming out whoever played Matt in the movie.  The action is fairly dull, and the story never gets any more believable than the premise.  I could almost just write this off as a bad action movie, but what elevates it to something I loathe is that it's based on an 80s cult classic movie of the same name.

The problem is that while there are many elements from the original copied in this new version, they miss everything that made the original interesting and memorable.  Where is the scene with Jed and the Russion soldier in their first battle in the woods.  The scene with Darryl is kind of there, but they nueter it, effectively removing what made it powerful.  Where is the enemy commander whose growing disillusionment leads to some of the most intersting characer development in the movie.  The new version opts to write it's own ending (even though the original ending was great), and no suprise, it's awful.  My goodness, they couldn't even get the music right, completely ignoring the memorable soundtrack of the orginal.

5394843,4,B00A7MSQRK,"I was really suprised. I've seen the origional and though so many cling to the ""heart"" of the 1980's version I found this one to actually sum up what is happening today. Before the credits are done rolling out in the beginning sets the stage and tone for the whole movie.
Sure, the elder brother is a veteran and teaches the kids how to survive and become a military platoon. To me that's more realistic than the origional. I know they constantly talk about North Korea but we all know who they are omitting between Russian and the Koreans when it comes to invading the U.S. It will be a joint effort because every one likes to be on the ""winning"" side, military folks included, and that's why there are three countries invading the U.S. not just the Russians.
p.s. spoiler, kinda. Cho is NOT a Korean surname. hint, hint.
So, if you want to compare it to the origional compare this. It keeps to the spirit that even if your outnumbered, outgunned, outskilled and have no resources you can still fight. Nice moral to the story if you ask me.
As for them stealing from a Subway, I say, Ha! screw subway. The folks in that store would have given them the food anyways. Wouldn't you and just say they stole it? ect, ect...
p.s.s. I wish I had a cabin like that. But then, they'd just bomb it.

Are you hating it on its own merit or because it is a remake of a movie you like? I saw the original and thought it was good for its time...but its time has passed and it was honestly a movie that could use a remake because, Hey! Kids fighting a war in America is kind of a good idea. Is this a good remake? I think it's not a bad one. There are things about it I like...like the ending. I like the ending of the remake far better than the original which I always thought was a weakness of the original. Plus I like the fact that the females have more to do. Now, could it have been better, well sure. It is an action movie. I don't think the original was exactly an action movie.

It would have made sense if maybe the Wolverines were Iraqis or Afghans not thrilled by us delivering them sweet freedoms via depleted Uranium shells and white phosphorus (not chemical weapons of mass destruction, no way).

It's not often that I do reviews of movies, but more and more frequently, Hollywood has been butchering all of the movies that I love so dearly.  I've loved Red Dawn (1984) since I was a kid, and I knew when I heard a remake was being made that it would most assuredly be bad.  My gut instinct did not let me down.  I watched this movie all the way through, and I paid attention throughout.  But, I hate this movie.  I hate it with a passion.

If I could send a message to Hollywood, it would be this:  Stop messing with my childhood memories of classic movies.  Try something new perhaps, and stop trying to profit off of my nostalgia.  I'm sick of it, and I know I'm not the only one.  I have yet to see a remake of a movie or television show that I liked.  You've forgotten about the upcoming generation who didn't grow up with the movies I did.  Instead, they're forced to watched bastardized versions of my generations movies.

If you've seen the original, you WILL be disappointed in this remake. It's far worse than the Total Recall remake vs the original. Had you never seen the Total Recall original but saw the remake, you might walk away feeling like it was a decent movie, but nothing memorable. But for those who saw the original, the remake is bland to the point of being insulting. If you haven't seen the original Red Dawn and are not even aware that this is a remake then you'd probably rate it 3.5 stars or maybe even 4 stars...if you're a pre-teen.

WAY TOO SHORT

94 minutes long. They don't spend any time developing the story in the beginning, they don't have much meat in the middle, and the ending was abrupt leaving you wondering if that really was the end. If this was the pilot to a TV series then this would probably have me eagerly anticipating and watching at least a few more episodes. For a movie...they dropped the ball. They had this awesome premise and it's like everyone just realized halfway through filming that it sucks and they all gave up. Very underdeveloped story. Nothing about it impresses.

The writing is as multilayered and complex as a russian novel, the characters are as delicately crafted as the finest Viennese layer-cake, and the acting by legends like Chris Hemsworth is reminiscent of the all time Hollywood greats like Marlon Brando.

You can tell that the artists (I will not call them writers, because what they created surpasses the merely sublime) who gave birth to the screenplay were clearly inspired by the Gods and were channeling Shakespeare. What's more is that this is not so much a movie as a prophesy - the day is coming when the North Koreans (who cleverly look like they're from a variety of Asian countries thanks to their DNA-camouflage technology) )will invade Suburban America and they WILL eat your dogs. And cats. And probably hamsters. Verily America, your Day of Dong awaits.

If America is very very lucky, a plucky good-looking group of super-naturally gifted teenagers will harness their X-box honed skills to restore America';s independence. Sadly, more than one dog will have to be turned into Chow Mein by the Koreans during this dark Chapter but rest assured in the end, we'll be trading high faves and singing Kenny Loggins songs.",1385251200,6,1237,4.913875598086125

I know nothing about him or what else he has done, but his acting/character was fairly shallow for lack of a better word.  Top that off with the fact that he actually looks about 30 years old instead of 16-18 as his character is suppose to be, and meh...

I liked th original, but I went into this without thinking about the first version and it turned out to be an entertaining movie.  Nothing I would buy for my collection (if I had one), but definitely worth a rainy Sunday.",1385251200,,611,4.269565217391304
5394894,4,B00A7MSQRK,"On the surface, I hate remakes.  They are a sign that nothing original is left to develop.

But a remake of Red Dawn that advances the time period and, therefore, the politics of the day, the available technology portrayed, the overall players involved in the grand scheme, as well as the regional attitudes of where the location is set, makes for an interesting contrast if one looks deep enough.  It's a movie, so overlooking plausibility is reasonable enough anyway.

The comparison expectations of this version versus the original is misleading if you compare film quality, actors, and the like.  Don't treat this as the SAME film.  Treat it as a different PERSPECTIVE of the story itself, as noted above.

The personalities and backgrounds of repeated characters are different, but again remember that we are changing locations, politics, and other factors that these same characters grew up with.  So the change in personality is understandable between versions.

The differences of the opposing factions' leaders' personalities is also understandable.  One cannot expect them both to have the same personality as they are different individuals.

I feel like, however, there are some missing elements in the new version, almost as if they hit the edit room floor and we're expected to ignore them.  For other viewers, those elements may have been caught and I simply missed them.  But I still feel like something was missing.

The alteration of the brothers' ending from one movie to the next seems well enough done.  Both were a nice ending, one with them dying in each other's' arms, the other with one carrying on after his brother's death.

There's also an interesting difference in the final endings as well, one with a monologue, the other with a visual representation, though this new version doesn't imply how things with the war ended, good or ill.

I think 4 stars is a decent enough grade, though maybe it should have been a 3 1/2 instead.  I really hate remakes, even if they have a purpose.",1385251200,,2009,4.928571428571429

What was that, maybe 20 planes each filled with paratroopers invading this packed residential neighborhood? Then 5 minutes later we hear Jed say it's a town of 500-thousand people? And we're to believe a band of 15 Disneyish kids is going to repel the Russian/North Korean armies from this major metropolis? The lead into the guerrila warfare is absurd to begin with. The film shows no evidence of atrocities or abuses by the invading forces. Maybe it was the iconic 1984 version which leads with Russians attacking unarmed teachers and school children, but there is NO effort to ever get the audience involved in the pain and suffering of the townspeople, if there is any.

The original concept of having the attacking force being the Red Chinese would be more believable, but even then China does not have the force projection capabilities that would be needed for this type of invasion.

The shocking premise, which was already hard to believe during the Cold War era, looks still preposterous in the remade version with North Korean soldiers literally falling from the sky. I kept thinking to myself, ""How did they do that?"" ""Why Spokane?"" but the film will not answer.

This is not to say that ""Red Dawn"" is a total failure. First-time director Dan Bradley's action-packed remake has several fine set-pieces, but I still do not know why this has to be remade now in the first place.",1381104000,,1100,4.7539267015706805
5394932,5,B00A7MSQRK,"I was skeptical of buying this video because of the original version was so good. This was a pleasant surprise, in its own way. It did follow the first film in a few areas however it went out on its own and did a very good job of it.
I was very happy when the movie was over and will certainly view it again.",1380758400,,308,3.828125
5394933,4,B00A7MSQRK,Seems shorter and flows better than the original.  The theme is the same with different forces.  I enjoyed it and the acting was done well enough that I caught myself thinking about how stupid some of the characters were being so the plot and acting were done well enough to get me into the movie.  I would buy it again.,1380672000,,320,4.3
5394934,5,B00A7MSQRK,I really enjoyed this movie...I never really saw the original but this one with Chris Hemsworth blew me away!  I love how up to date it was...super cool!,1380499200,,153,4.464285714285714
5394935,5,B00A7MSQRK,This re-make is better than the original and the original wasn't bad. I don't say that lightly because so many re-makes are just awful but I think you will like this one.,1380326400,,170,4.34375
5394936,5,B00A7MSQRK,I was hesitant about this movie at first because I love the original with Patrick Swayze so much. I was pleasantly surprised when I finally got around to watching it today. This is an excellent film. Great storyline and acting. It will be one that I watch over and over again. So glad I have it on DVD.,1380153600,,302,4.224137931034483
5394937,4,B00A7MSQRK,"It's a fun ride. To be honest, I thought the original went on for too long, or maybe it was the pacing. I love 80's films and can understand peoples gripes, but this didn't seem so different from the original that people should be bashing it. Man Of Steel I would understand. Anyway, the remake here moves briskly and has some good action and tense sequences. Hemsworth is solid leading man as well. Even Tom Cruise's kid did a fine job. He wasn't annoying like some young actors. I was pleasently surprised overall and entertained. That's all you can ask in movies nowadays. I think I'll pick up the DVD on sale.",1380067200,,613,4.482142857142857

5394939,1,B00A7MSQRK,"This is one of the worst war movies I've seen. No story line, no character development, the props were all American military hardware used by North Korea?

5394949,5,B00A7MSQRK,"I loved the original and I love the remake! Both are great movies in my opinion! This movie has changed a few things and I like the ending better in this than the original, other than that the story is very much the same.
One morning in a regular American town, the people wake up to an invasion from the North Koreans and everything is taken over. A small band of people get away and head up towards the mountains and former Marine, Jed trains the group of teenagers and leads the group known as the Wolverines. I waited for the DVD of this movie because at first I thought ""oh no, not another remake"", so when I finally did watch it on DVD I had zero expectations, but I really liked it, so I ended up ordering the Blu-Ray/DVD combo set and I've watched it a few more times since. I don't understand the bad reviews this movie gets, I think it is just as good as the original and without spoiling anything, the ending wasn't as dark as the original which is another thing I liked. All around this is a good movie, so if you like action / war movies, watch it!",1378080000,,1061,4.180487804878049

The acting was great, and I loved it. It made me cry and made me angry, definitely a lot of mixed emotions on this. I thought it was engaging.

I recommend watching this film, if you loved the old, you will LOVE this one!!!",1377648000,,414,4.227848101265823

5394955,3,B00A7MSQRK,"Okay, so having read all the other favorable and non favorable reviews and without repeating what others have said regarding plots. I will say this...The success of this film or at least my favorable review would depend on what happens next. They left this so wide open for a sequel, its almost clich&eacute;. The question begets, in what form would the sequel take shape. The film paralleled a lot of the original, including specific lines of dialogue to plot points. Only this time, we don't really know what happened to Darrel, the Mayor's son who was ""left behind"" as opposed to killed off as he was in the 84 original.  The last sequence suggests the story will go on or could go on. Was this a set up for another film or perhaps, a TV series spinoff. Depending on how it is treated may change my opinion. If nothing happens, then I must agree that it was 94 minutes I will never get back, but if there is a sequel or a series that continues the story, I will reserve my overall judgement until then",1377475200,,1004,4.427027027027027

5394958,3,B00A7MSQRK,"wasn't expecting too much from this movie, but the first one was part of my youth, so I figured I had to see it.  I will admit that it was better than the original as far as action, possibly as far as script, and as for the acting ... well, the original is sort of iconic in my memory, so I guess I can't really honestly compare the two.

That is not to say this is a good movie .... I watched it for the nostalgia factor and was entertained for that reason ... as far as its ability to stand on its own,  well, its a kind of silly premise, but might be worth a rainy afternoon if you were being lazy and there was nothing else to watch.",1377129600,,637,3.8846153846153846

5394961,3,B00A7MSQRK,"This 2012 remake of the original ""Red Dawn"" is okay. It was worth watching. But the original, even though cheesy in spots, got me involved and this one didn't.

It should have worked (and in parts it did) because it makes more sense to have an off-duty Marine leading the Wolverines than a high school football star. But it fell flat. It felt like a movie rather than U.S. citizens fighting for their freedom.

I liked the casting in the original more too - more believable - both good guys and bad. And I liked that the original took place in small-town America rather than city (Spokane-Seattle area).

So, watchable but not re-watchable.",1377043200,,640,4.646017699115045

Even my father, not one to effuse over much, said that was the closest he had seen a movie come to expressing the emotion of real war without actually making the viewer cold, hungry and tired. Granted, in the hindsight of 30 years later, the original probably left a lot to be desired, but...

The remake? Terrible. The only reason I rated it a 2 star above is because I loved the original so much I hate to rate the remake any lower.

The acting was terrible, the plot-line jumpy, inconsistent and not believable. (I understand that the Chinese money that was invested in the film created a certain awkwardness, but changing the ""invader"" to North Korea? Seriously? The United States was invaded by NORTH KOREA? The Chinese investors should have just let the Chinese remain the baddies and walked away with more money.) There was only one character in any way developed, (Matt Eckard, played by Josh Bell, the overweight kid from that Nickelodeon show that barely registered on my TV radar in the 90's) and it was stilted and overdone. The lines they borrowed from the original were terribly delivered.

The final scene where the kids are charging the ""Re-Education camp"" (or whatever it was supposed to be) was just plain laughable. I guess to a generation that grew up playing Call of Duty:Modern Warfare, it was super-cool, but this old guy who grew up under the very real threat of nuclear war and superpower confrontation just can't buy it.",1374624000,,1580,4.676258992805756

5395010,4,B00A7MSQRK,"This was a great film. I have no idea why the critics gutted it so bad. Probably because they were comparing it to the original.

Three survive that refuse sanctuary with the leaving USMC strike force and return to organise a new Wolverine strike force and continue the fight until all America is a Free America. I liked the 2nd Gen but for different reasons than the 1st Gen movie. More Hollywood in this one not as well equiped as the first one, the 1st Gen movie always seemed to have the right equip for each mission. While in the 2nd Gen they were never as well supplied!

I was surprised. Considering they were working with a premise so completely full of corn, the makers of RED DAWN (2012) did about the best job possible. The acting (particularly by Josh Peck) and script are generally quite good, and the film effectively blends America's current economic/political situation into its storyline. Quite a few stretches and a lot of very unrealistic violence, but there are also one or two truly unexpected turnabouts here. Good cheesy fun, and probably better than the original!

I rented the RED DAW HD. Once again this story is made into a new movie.  This is about thirty years after the first version.  Both are good, but this is a happier ending than the first one.  I personally like the idea of some survivors rather that just a plaque.  When the USA is invaded by foreign countries paratroopers, a group of high school students, known as the Wolverines, go into hiding and fight the enemy using guerilla warfare on their home turf.

5395063,1,B00A7MSQRK,"I went in wanting to like this.  I'm a huge fan of the original and several of these actors are good so I was excited to see it.  Let's leave out how this is a bad remake for a moment:  This is just a bad movie.

The characters are, for the most part, paper thin.  The only one that has a real storyline is Matty, and he's so stupid and self-centered that we were all rooting for him to die.  The bad guys, trained military professionals, are beyond inept.  The way the kids get weapons and gear and food and vehicles (basically they waltz in-and-out of the enemy-controlled city) is silly.  Characters die and we literally had no idea what their names were until their friends were shouting their names at their dead bodies.  The plot-holes are numerous and you can drive a tank right through them -- oh wait, these kids just did that.

If you are a fan of the original, for the love of all that is good and holy, do not watch it.  Not only is it unrecognizable, not only did they get rid of all the tense and gritty stuff that made the first one seem possible, they actually mock one of the important character scenes from the original.  I'm not making this up -- they mock it.  Why would you want to do that?  If you have any audience that came to see this because they liked the first movie, why include something that they are sure to hate?

I like remakes.  I'm not one of those people that is against the idea of a remake just because I liked the original.  But it still has to be a good movie even if they change every little thing about it.  This is not.  It's just plain bad in everything I want in a movie:  actual characters, good storyline, character growth, entertaining action scenes.  If this movie could have given me a little of that, I would have given it more stars.  All it gave me was the buyers remorse.",1371427200,,1826,4.231884057971015

5395070,4,B00A7MSQRK,"I just finished watching this film and i have to say for the most part its pretty good. There are some concerns or complaints that I'll address in a minute. This film follows a group of kids being lead by a Marine who was on leave when it all went down and their fight to regain their freedom.

All this considered the acting for the most part was good, many of the actors did a outstanding job. The leader of the Wolverines is Jed, a 6 year Marine Corps combat veteran. Chris does a good job giving his lines and playing that serious battle-hardened Marine who is trying to lead a bunch of kids including his younger brother Matt (often referred to by Jed as Matty). Matt (played by Josh) is a high school kid who is a self centered ""cowboy"" who tries to be the hero and do everything himself. He resists being a warrior and taking orders from his older brother whom he feels abandoned him. His lack of discipline and self centered ways often put the Wolverines in danger. Josh does a good job at playing this self centered kid and through much of the movie i just couldn't stand the selfish behavior of his character. Many people don't realize that the relationship between Jed and Matt is a sub story involving their relationship as brothers and their past as family.

What bothers me about Red Dawn 2012? Well to be honest not as much as some other viewers. Without giving up much of the story i'll say Jed is really portrayed as almost an unstoppable force barely phased by bullets hitting him. The other complaint is the vehicles used in the film by the enemy, specifically the use of the M1A1 Tank. It just wouldn't be a vehicle that would be given to the enemy portrayed.  In the story could they have stolen them? Sure i suppose but if so the context of that should've been added to the story. For the most part that is all that bothered me personally at least all that was significant enough to mention.

Now to address what many have already. Is this a good remake and i say without hesitation.. YES! This is what is tough about remakes and sequels. When there is already one that sets the standard and there will always be those who don't like the new one. When you look at this movie you really shouldnt try to compare it to the first one. This should be looked at as its own movie. If you do that then your more likely to enjoy it.

However i would like to note that while the ending was good if your planning a sequel. But it was in my opinion abrupt and open ended. They didn't really in my opinion do a good job finishing up the story leaving the viewer with a feeling of completion. Rather i felt like it couldn't be the end however it could be like that for 3 reasons that come to mind.

1. To have a good starting point for a sequel
2. To leave it open ended allowing the viewer to imagine in their mind of how they think the war would finish.
3. To keep it portrayed as focused on a small group of people over a relatively short period of time. Here is an example, think if you will that you watch a documentary about D-Day and it is all that was covered in the documentary. Do you know there were other battles in WW2? Sure, but the focus was on one specific time period. The ending of this remake could've been like that to keep the focus on a small period of events.

Overall this movie is good, it's action, effects, good acting, and better than average story make this film enjoyable and earn it a 4 out of 5 star rating.",1371081600,,3447,4.261467889908257

****Spoiler Alert****
The part where the father was talking to the boys at the cabin was a little predictable to me.  Still liked that part though.  As a mother I would hope to tell my kids to new give up as well.
The soviet was brought in as a tracker only.  Other people are saying he is suppose to be more, but not in this movie.  That is why the Mayors son Daryl gets a tracking device placed on him by the soviet.  I did hate the building scene though.  I like how they ended the movie with Matt training more people.  It leaves it open for a sequel.  In the beginning of the movie Robert can't kill even pukes when others do.  Then he finds his reason to fight and becomes a Bad A**.

5395100,1,B00A7MSQRK,"The original Red Dawn wins on soundtrack alone.  That movie had a great little theme that would play when the Wolverines were opening a can on the Russians.  I still like to play the theme song to Wolverines in the bedroom before the action starts.  I keep an ipod on my nightstand with the song loaded and ready to go.  When the moment is right, I reach over and get that baby rolling.  It's awesome.  ""DA - DA - DA ...dadadadada...da...da... da-dadadadada...da...da... DA - DA - DA ...dadadadada...da...da...  Yep, she loves it.  Especially at the end when I yell ""Wolverines!""  If you can imagine, I typically hold the ""e"" sound for a length of time.  It sounds sort of like ""Wolver eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee nes!""

Now you try it.  Come on... yell ""Wolver eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee nes!""

Now tilt back your head and close your eyes. One more time... ""Wolver eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee nes!""

Last one - do all that again, but this time drop your voice one octav and scrunch up your face.  The sound should come from deep in your chest and be pushed out of your mouth like hot vomit... ""Wolver eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee nes!""

I remind myself of that dude at the end of the original who climbs up on the rock, uncovers his face, then fires his machine gun at the Russian helicopter.  I remind you of the most awesome dude you ever met times 10.

The new version has what?  Certainly no ""Wolver eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee nes!""  Also, what is the Wolverine song this time?  I sure as heck don't know.  If I used the new soundtrack it would ruin my love life.

The casting was terrible as well.  Thor was ok as Jed, but the rest were awful.  Too cutsie for my taste.  The original cast had a gritty quality to them.  This group looked like a boy band mixed with a couple girls you might see on Survivor.

Also, what a dumb way to kill Jed.  The guy is the main character and he just goes and gets blasted while walking down a hallway.  That's the best they could do?  Jed?  Jed?  What happened?  Is that your brains on the wall?

I ask - did the characters ever look uncomfortable?  The girls maybe had their hair a little messed up, but it looked to me like the boys were freshly groomed every day.  Other than Jed's whiskers, I'd say they just got out of a dance club rather than fighting a guerilla war for a few months.",1369785600,,2308,4.474698795180723

Apparently some of these younger actors are famous among younger people, but I only recognized the guy playing Jed and the girl from Friday Night Lights. The actor playing Matty was flat out terrible. Why does he look like he's crying in almost every scene his face appears?!? There was no self sufficiency toughness to his character like in the original. The guy playing the mayor's kid looked like a little boy. I mean more similar to a middle school little boy rather than a high school young man in transition. The other friend who holds up his rifle at one point and yells Wolverines in a nod to the original was completely unbelievable. His acting was less than professional. With all of these actors coming across more as a high school theater group rather than professionals, I have to believe the directing may deserve much of the blame.

The guy playing Jed managed to at least provide a semblance of a trained actor and the girl from Friday Night Lights wasn't bad, but they must have been frustrated dealing with the amateurs that make up the rest of the cast.

The North Koreans replace the Russians now as the primary attacking force and Ruskies replace the Cubans as the behind the scenes bad guys.  Otherwise it's all pretty much the same film.

Hunky Chris Hemsworth plays Jed Eckert.  He's home on leave and leads a small band of high schoolers who head for the Spokane hills when the town is invaded by paratroopers.  The group become pretty darn good at terrorism as they disrupt the North Koreans attempt to pacify the town.  Like the original, the rationale for all of this is never quite explained.  How did it happen?  Why?  The politics don't make any sense, so we just have to accept it and stick with the red meat battle plan and the interwoven personal stories.

The remake takes place now.  I do not know who any of the actors are.  Kim Jung Il dies and Kim Jung Un takes over.  Think about what North Korea is doing now.  Statements about the new North Korean regime by Obama, Biden, Hillary Clinton are shown.  There is commentary about the vulnerability the US communication grid is.
The North Koreans disrupt our communications grid and invade the west coast.  A North Korean invasion makes more sense than a Cuban one.
Citizens in the occupied zone join the fight with the Wolverines.  Which also makes more sense.
The movie follows the plot of the original, but it takes place today and not in the 60s.  Aspects in both films do not make logical sense, but this is a movie.

Apart from the original of course we have some special effects that make the movie more exciting.  I expected to see a little more special effects and something about the movie just made it seem short.  I can't place my finger on what is out of sort but it is almost like they rushed through the filming. The cast is excellent, love Chris Hemsworth in everthing.  Josh OMG from Drake and Josh what a transformation. Worth a watch indeed.",1368489600,,537,4.34

This one was all blow up and run.  Another thing I hated was the change from Chinese to North Koreans?  REALLY???  We don't want to upset the Chinese so we edit them into N.K.'s???

The original Red Dawn was an OK movie, but this one is much better!  Better action, better acting, etc, all around... now that doesn't mean this was an amazing movie, just a better than the original kind of movie.

5395183,2,B00A7MSQRK,Was not what I expected. I thought this movie could have been better. A town taken over. In one area some people were held like hostages and some people were like walking around like nothing happened. I don't know...,1367971200,,216,4.564102564102564

5395185,3,B00A7MSQRK,"I loved this movie the first time around, in the pre-cell phone days and when the Russians were still the cold war villains we made them out to be.  The thought of having to fight for your freedom, something I had never done back then, was nearly romanticized and those doing the fighting in the way they were felt nearly relatable.  This time around the characters are so pretty, boy and girl alike, that you cant relate as easy and the premise as a whole seems so far out there that it was a bit harder to suspend belief for the running time.  I still like the idea of the movie, and the first one is a classic, but this is one of those that didn't really need a new polishing up.",1367884800,,682,4.151515151515151

The original seemed more realistic considering the realities of the Cold War at the time. Also, the characters that played the enemy soldiers in the original seemed more human, or just seemed to have more character, again making it more realistic. In this one, they seem cold and there was something missing about them, adding to the unrealistic nature of the movie. All in all, though, it still managed to entertain me with the action and the concept that that if we're ever invaded by a foreign army, America will stand up and fight it.",1367452800,2,692,4.544

What was most impressive was the ""look"" of this film. The action was believable and fast. The stars gave us pathos, fear, pride and the selflessness that a corp of fighters has to have to succeed. This was so professionally done.

Besides that the younger brother of Chris Hemsworth's character, is possibly the most annoying actor/character i have seen in years.

Spoiler alert.
Some of the reviews that kept me from renting this brought up things that made me question how hokey the movie was. But now that I've watched it let me refute those problems.
You have people saying its not credible because North Korea could never pull it off, they're too poor, yadda yadda yadda. But in the movie, within the first half an hour you have someone saying the same thing and saying they must have had help, and then towards the end Russia is shown to be that help.
Then you have people complaining that they robbed a subway store. As far as I know, when you invade a country and want to keep the population pacified, you keep their society running as normal as possible. So keeping a restaurant open isn't out of the ordinary. Where did they get the supplies and electricity for it? Generators and other stores in the area? Who knows, but if you're gonna analyze a movie that much then you probably hate most movies. In your book Terminator must have sucked!!!
Some people complained about it being a teeny bopper love story. I didn't see any of that. In fact I think the original had more of that in it than this one did.
All in all it was a good watch for 4.99. I don't know how it can be more expensive than The Hobbit, but after watching it I don't feel ripped off",1366588800,,1413,4.335849056603774

5395260,3,B00A7MSQRK,"First of all let's get this out of the way right now.  Yes I saw the original back in the 80's and I loved it.  Okay now that we got that out of the way, let's move on.

The action was incredible!  The gunfights were great and the running battles rocked so hard!  The costumes of the North Korean invaders were very realistic as well!  I actually thought I was looking at real life North Korean soldiers!

Plus when Josh Hutcherson's character raised his assault rifle to the heavens and yelled the classic line of ""WOLVERINES!!!""  I had the same chills run through my body that I had back in the 80's when C. Thomas Howell did it.

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

There are some parts in the movie that just didn't make any sense to me.  Like when the father/sheriff is on the bullhorn telling his sons to go to war and the Korean officer is about to shoot him.  Right then Chris Hemsworth's character had a hunting rifle with him and it was pointed at the officer, plus it had a scope on it.  So why didn't he just shoot the guy before his father was shot?  I mean, that's what I'd do if I was in that situation and someone was about to shoot my dad.

Plus later one when the Wolverines and their new allies infiltrate the police station which was turned into the Korean HQ, they run into some soldiers there and are spotted.  One of the Korean soldiers is a woman and she shrieks like a little girl upon seeing enemy soldiers.  Why did she do that instead of drawing her sidearm and shooting the intruders?  Seriously!  You're a soldier and you've been trained pretty much since you could hold a gun on how to be a soldier for the North Korean dictatorship.  And your reaction to seeing the enemy is to scream at the top of your lungs like a little girl who just saw a mouse?  How the hell did she make it through basic training if this is how to she responds to a combat situation?  You'd think this would have been addressed before she was dropped into an active warzone.

Another thing I didn't understand.  What was the point of bringing in the Russian commando and pointing him out to the audience?  Seriously, the only thing he does is tackle one of the Wolverines and inject him with a tracking device so they can find the Wolverines.  ANYONE could have done that!  Why did they need to spend time and money to bring this guy in from Russia?  The North Koreans don't have anyone in their military that can push the plunger down on a syringe?  They have to outsource that to a Russian guy?

Something else that bugged me, why didn't we see the fate of the mayor's son when they abandon him because he's got the tracking device in him?  They just give him some gear, a machine gun and we never see him again.  It would be nice to see his last stand.

Once Chris Hemsworth's character dies the movie just takes a dive.  His brother is left to lead the Wolverines and he just can't pull it off like his brother did.  He tries to give a rousing speech to inspire others to join the Wolverines to fight the North Koreans but he just fails miserably.  It's like he was mumbling his way through this speech.  I doubt this guy could lead a troop of girl scouts let alone a group of freedom fighters!

The ending is a disappointment as well.  We are shown an overhead shot of the high school football field that was turned into a prison camp.  The American prisoners are rattling their cells, shouting ""Wolverines!"" over and over.  We're given shots of the North Korean guards who are nervously watching the prisoners, their weapons being held tightly and we can see they are scared.  Then in the distance we see a group of vehicles racing toward the prison, guns blazing, RPG's are being fired and the guard towers are destroyed in fiery explosions!  The American prisoners, still shouting ""WOLVERINES!""  Are charging toward the gate, one of them finds an American flag and begins waving it furiously, the audience is on the edge of their seats in anticipation of what will happen next!  And we roll the credits.  REALLY!?!  You pulled a Sopranos on us!?!  We don't even get to see what happens?  Were the prisoners liberated?  Did the North Koreans gun them down?  Was it a trap set by the North Koreans?  Did the escaping prisoners join the Wolverines and help re-take the city?  We don't know, it's left up to our imagination.  THAT SUCKED!!!

***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***

There are a few homages to the original film, such as the battle cry of ""WOLVERINES!!!""  As they stop the execution of the townspeople.  The phrase, ""The chair is against the wall"" over the radio.  Plus a few others as well.

The movie had it's flaws, but it was also very good.  I loved Chris Hemsworth in this and his character basically carried the whole movie.  It reminded me of the original film and it brought that film to the current era with changing the villains from the Russians to the North Koreans.  It also gave me the same thrill that the original did and it made me proud to be an American.

In the first Red Dawn the story line was the girls were there because they were hiding out from the troops and one was a victim of rape of a foreign troop and traumatized.  In here she's a girlfriend? I also see she was living in the camp for how long and she was saved by the wolverines - she strolls out of there untouched (they pretty much inferred it seemed to me????

5395299,4,B00A7MSQRK,"It seems the Koreans have become the go to bad guys when it comes to trying to take down America. In the recent theater release OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN (a good movie by the way) they take over the White House and capture the President. And in this week's pick on DVD, RED DAWN, they actually invade the US.

RED DAWN is a remake of the 1984 film that starred Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell and Charlie Sheen. This time around the story remains similar and the cast is a new group of up and coming young stars.

Jed Eckert (Chris Hemsworth) is a Marine back from Afghanistan visiting his family. While his police chief dad welcomes him apparently there is some issue with his younger brother Matt (Josh Peck). The reunion is short lived as his first morning home the youngsters are awakened by a thunderous noise and then an airplane crashing into the house next door. Looking to see what is up they witness a mass invasion via parachute into their northwestern town.

The two jump in Jed's truck and head out, finding their father and then separating as armed soldiers begin trying to shoot at them. As they drive off they pick up a few other teens and head for the family cabin in the woods. Listening to the news they find out that the North Koreans have invaded the U.S. and taken over many major cities on the west coast. During the night two of the kids picked up head out on their own, taking the food that was in the house. They return later with the North Korean head Capt. Cho (Will Yun Lee), the mayor (whose son is part of the group) and the boy's father. When given a chance to call them to come out, he instead tells them to kill Capt. Cho and stop anything he does. This results in his death before their eyes and a thirst for vengeance.

With Jed in the lead this group of youngsters becomes an insurgent force, sabotaging various areas that are under the control of the North Koreans. Along the way they tag the places they go via spray paint with the word WOLVERINES, the name of the high school mascot. Their exploits inspire others to aid them even at the cost of death. As in the original, the team eventually comes into contact with a soldier in the U.S. Marines who lets them know what's been going on. Word of their exploits has reached them and they need their help.

On one hand the whole plot of this movie might seem far fetched. But when you suspend belief as all good movies ask you to do, you find yourself rooting and cheering for these young people out to fight the good fight, taking on an enemy that wants to do nothing more but destroy America.

The film holds plenty of well choreographed action scenes, plenty of gunplay and explosions and all involved present themselves incredibly well and believable in their roles. All of them come off as people you'd want in your corner if things turned bad. But there's another star of this film whose names won't appear in the credits.

That star is the American people and the spirit they possess. For far too long, for me at least, viewers have had to sit through countless movies where American's are portrayed as the real bad guys, the ones who do nothing but harm people around the world, who go crazy at the slightest thing and wreak havoc on innocent people no matter where they are. They have heroes that are anti-heroes at best, men who save the day but at the cost of abusing someone, raping some woman or being the nastiest person around. This has become the norm it seems. This movie doesn't have that.

Instead, the white hats and the black hats are easily identifiable here. And in today's world surprisingly enough that's a nice change. Maybe the world isn't all black and white, but when it comes to movies it's nice to feel that perhaps we aren't the terrible people that Hollywood would have us believe we are. RED DAWN is a movie that inspires while entertaining, giving you a sense of pride in this country. The same holds true of OLYMPUS. I hope these movies are successful enough to inspire more to be made but doubt it. Until then we can enjoy these movies and those made in the past. Maybe one day they'll learn.",1365897600,2,4111,4.435761589403974

5395321,1,B00A7MSQRK,"Okay, I've read some reviews that say you can't compare this 2013 ""Red Dawn"" to the 80's ""Red Dawn"", but of course you can. It is what the creators of the film did. They took the original film directed by John Milius, starring Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, Charlie Sheen, Lea Thompson and Jennifer Grey and recreated it. So of course you can compare the two movies.

The 80's ""Red Dawn"" wasn't a great film to begin with, but it happened to have some big stars before ""Dirty Dancing"", before ""Soul Man"", before ""Back to the Future"" and before everything Charlie Sheen did. It also had a director that had tact. Remember that word ""TACT"", because very few in Hollywood actually have this long forgotten directorial trait. The premise of both ""Red Dawn"" films is a stretch, but Milius makes it believable somehow. Why? Because he had tact. He cared about the characters he was portraying. He walked us through their reluctance to leave their families behind. He walked us through their first taste of fighting back against the invaders and you could feel their immaturity as they took their first life. He relied on a great actor like Harry Dean Stanton to deliver one of the most important and powerful scenes as he talks to his sons through the POW fence, only to yell, ""Boys! Avenge me! Avenge me!"" As he's taken away.

The new 2013 ""Red Dawn"" had none of this. It has no personality. It is so void of personality, a guy like me, who loves action movies lost interest within 25 minutes. The fact that this movie, directed by stunt man Dan Bradley in his directorial debut is ranked even close to the original or even close to mediocre is a perfect example why these feeling-challenged films keep getting made. Hollywood keeps puking them out and people keep accepting it.

Sorry Hollywood. I'm not a puppet. I'm tired of these movies. It's a sad and embarrassing shame that every time I want to watch a real action movie, I have to go to my dvd/bluray collection of 80s movies. Action movies these days are like watching somebody else play a video game and tell you how great they are. I'm done with them. It's also a sad state of affairs that the list of the good action movies in the last 10 years is so short. ""Batman Begins"", ""Dark Knight"", ""Dark Knight Rises"" ""Kick-Ass"" ""Skyfall"", ""The Avengers"", ""X-Men: First Class"", ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"", ""Jack Reacher"", ""Last Stand"", ""Thor"", ""Star Trek"", ""The Amazing Spiderman"".  Probably missing some... but off the top of my head, that's it, and some of those are more sci/fi than action.

It was definitely contrived and ridiculous, but it was exciting for teens and twenty something's. It struck a very patriotic chord with me, hoping that my generation WOULD fight back against an occupying force.
The 1984 film was always a bit heavy handed and some of the acting was WAAAY over the top, but at least there was a sense of continuity and an emotional connection to the characters.

That continuity and emotional connection is non-existent in the remake. I suppose today's TWITTER and texting generation cannot be bothered with subtleties such as logic and plot, but those are missing from this film.

I believed Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen were brothers bound by blood and loyalty. I don't sense any connection between Chris Hemsworth and the unknown actor who plays the Charlie Sheen character. Hemsworth is a better actor than Swayze, but he has little to work with.

The first half hour of the film essentially covers, in abbreviated form, over three quarters of the original film in a far more nonsensical manner. There is no build up or sense of ""one-ness"" with the characters. What's missing is a heart and soul. This film has some interesting little changes, but it essentially follows the originals plot, substituting North Korea for Russian and Cuba (from the first film).

The poignancy of this is lost especially right now that North Korea is actually making threats to the U.S. and those threats seem very silly and hollow since China, Russia and our allies have all stated they're against any North Korean threat.

This is a pale immitation of the original - and it was a fantastical ""what if"" film that was silly in its own way.

WOLVERINES!!!

This movie has some heart but if you know anything about military tactics you'll need to suspend disbelief or you just won't enjoy the film. This will likely appeal to some youth who feel they are not doing enough with their lives and want proof that they can when older generations muck up the world.

The economy has gotten worse and North Korea has allied with other Asian countries and guess what? They hate America. So they invade a good chunk of the west coast and some kids in a suburb learn guerrilla warfare (in only a few weeks or is it months?) because they're trained by a marine private (played by Chris Hemsworth . .. where are you Patrick Swayze?) and, you know, with enough montages in a film you can become a pro at anything, right?

Uhm, WOLVERINES!!!

See nerd kids take on veteran soldiers who cannot hit the side of a barn. See Asian soldiers fall for stupid traps. See romance and friendship blossom between kids who run around like dorks (teach some of those actors and actresses to run properly, please). See people sacrifice themselves so that the Wolverines can go on. See the Wolverines get out of a tough jam because, well, they're the heroes.

Interesting propaganda about America's greed doing them in and perhaps a nod to the 99% to the 1% but they didn't explore it more which could have been the most interesting idea in this film.

That said, it had some heart in certain places and if you can ignore the poor military tactics and coincidences that let the Wolverines prevail, well, you may enjoy it.

Duuuuuh, WOLVERINES?

Also starring Jeffrey Dean Morgan as one of the grizzled marines.

Based on a 1984 film during the height of Cold War paranoia and the fearful belief that America's enemies would invade. The budget was $65M and it made a bit over $48M at the Box Office. Darn. I was hoping it would have made enough so that there could be a sequel.

5395335,3,B00A7MSQRK,I am not going to say the acting was better in the original or the story was better.  I will say that times have changed and the story was weak and just as far fetched as the original.  What it lacked was a group of actors that you connect to.

Unfortunately the story sounded like something ripped from the headlines that could appear on the evening news, though I doubt such and invasion could take place without the USA allowing it due to our military intelligence, etc. I liked the movie. There was a lot of action. I can't compare it to the original version because I never viewed the first make of the movie, but I liked how relevant this was to the environment around the world today with tensions and gun control, North Korea's latest issues, etc. It had a good message that we need to fight when people try to take away our liberty as US citizens.",1365465600,,726,4.549618320610687

This enemy is  so dangerous and well trained like a crazy dogs  ,as merciless as primitive. This group of young patriots would be ""sweepped"" in seconds...
By the way - what is the beginning? - airplanes from  enemy coming on US territory, dropping paratroops - bulls***. Did US lost radars? and Air Force? Don't we have perfect  ground to air missiles to smash the enemy's aiplanes?

5395346,2,B00A7MSQRK,"I've seen a lot of good reviews of this movie and I've seen a lot of bad reviews of this movie.  My opinion lies somewhere in between.  Though I think Red Dawn was earnest enough in its attempt to entertain, when it all comes down to it, it just really doesn't work.  The opening fifteen minutes or so are very exciting and had me believing I was in for a sweet ride.  Sadly as the movie progressed it completely fell flat on its face.  I guess my biggest problems with Red Dawn are first the lack of a gradual build up.  Terrorists attack and ten minutes later a group of high schoolers are suddenly seasoned machine gun veterans.  It all seemed to happen just a little too fast.  There was no shock or confusion or even questions about what was going on.  Not very convincing under the circumstances.  Another major problem I had with the film is that it's so easy for the gang to come and go as they please in a small military occupied  town.  Seriously.  They just went where ever they wanted to go without anyone questioning a thing.  Why wouldn't other people from the town go hide out if it's that easy to escape?  Though there are moments of real entertainment in the movie in the end it's kinda boring.  I was pretty glad when the credits rolled at the hour and a half mark.  I was bored 40 minutes in and was afraid I had 80 more minutes of boredom to endure.  I don't want to hate on this movie, because like I said there were a few truly entertaining parts, but they were just too insubstantial.  I was not a big fan of the original either.  It was really sort of campy and silly and probably a much better movie when it was released (I'm going to assume that it hasn't stood the test of time).  This movie honestly tries to be entertaining, but there are just so many things that do not work.  How can a premise with so much potential be so bland?  Oh, and by the way-the shameless subway commercial made me want to throw up a little.  Product placement in a movie is one thing, but when it calls attention to itself and takes you out of the story that's something else entirely.",1365465600,2,2092,4.264631043256998
5395347,5,B00A7MSQRK,I loved this action pact movie from the begining to the end. Even though it was a remake not quite like the 80's version witch was not as action packed.

The story lines are consistently the same, differing in minor details and adjusted for the current political situation.  Definitely takes a lot of ""suspension of disbelief,"" though.  North Korea invading the west coast with paratroops?  Russia takes the east coast?

If you take it for what it is, it's good for a couple of hours of entertainment.  But don't try and make the events fit into the real world, it just won't work.",1365465600,,494,4.686046511627907

5395362,4,B00A7MSQRK,"CONTAINS NO SPOILERS

For most to truly enjoy this film it first is required that you must engage your ability to enjoy a fictional work that thoroughly contradicts reality, logic and especially relevant military technology that you may or may not have or have had a more than intimate professional relationship with.

That statement rings equally true with the original Red Dawn film. How can you fault a remake for staying consistent with the original there or following closely original plot points, screenplay and premise.

Without suspension of disbelief, frankly, you will be wasting your time. Ask yourself normally do you watch action movies for reality based entertainment or the escape from reality that the illusion of Hollywood sometimes magically provides?

For fans of the first film. If you channel your likely inner child mindset from when you originally watched the original Red Dawn and ignore your distaste for Hollywood remakes. Then you likely will enjoy this version of Red Dawn as well.

4 Stars is high marks for this film and arguably generous.

I screened it through streaming. Having now seen the remake I will purchase a copy for my film library. In itself that is truly how you vote positive for film. With your wallet.

If after having read this review you purchase the film are not entertained and truly disappointed. What can I honestly say? My review is merely my opinion. I haven't read any other reviews. I suspect that this film will likely have a significant amount of unfavourable reviews.

5395365,3,B00A7MSQRK,"I must say I am a fan of the original Red Dawn and I was a bit skeptical of the remake. Even though the original (made in the early 80's) wasn't as flashy as this remake, I think the original is better. This movie is ok to watch but definitely not as good as the original movie. The acting is a bit flat, with the exception of Chris Helmsworth, who does an admirable Jed Eckert but most of the rest of the acting is average at best with some cheesy lines. The story/plot is not as good as well as this movie was held from release for a couple years and the North Koreans were changed from originally being Chinese. It seemed that this movie was trying so much to be politically correct and trying to avoid offending the Chinese or the Russians which took away from a more believable plot. The original movie made me care about the high school kids that were the wolverines and made me feel for the loss of the Wolverines. This one didn't provide any character development other than a rivalry among brothers which to me detracted from the original story of the Ekerts. With most remakes, they are hit and miss, unfortunately this movie is more miss and makes you wonder if this movie should have even been attempted. This movie will be an average movie for most, but for those who know and love the original, this version will not hold a candle to it.",1365206400,,1351,4.3438735177865615

5395370,2,B00A7MSQRK,"This ""movie"" has major problems (not just compared to the original which was a much better movie).
1)You won't really care about the characters because they're not developed...at all.  It's basically: here I am, lemme have a gun. [no motivation for anything they do or the way they act both the good guys and the bad guys].
2)Because of the lack of character in the characters you basically have cardboard cutouts of people such as in a VIDEOGAME.
3)The bad guys end up being more interesting than the good guys, no really.  They introduce marines near the end of the movie and you're thinking ""these seem like pretty interesting guys with a lot of stories to tell""; they basically say nothing then they kill most of them off in the next 10 minutes; the remaining marine says a one liner then leaves in a helicopter but they don't show the helicopter leaving because they didn't have the money for it (apparently).
4)The plot goes NOWHERE, the ending is ""we ran out of money here's the credits"".

It's just an awful cardboard cutout of a movie (cough...a videogame in live action) that really accomplishes nothing; even for an action movie it doesn't really work because it goes NOWHERE.  Nothing is resolved.  It's watchable for the action but if you think about it at all, it will start to annoy you; I can't see how the ""ending"" wouldn't annoy everyone who sees it but there are some really stupid people in the world.",1365206400,,1421,4.645418326693227

5395372,3,B00A7MSQRK,"For just a slightly more than mindless action movie it was fine and it even had some OK acting and a few dramatic moments.  However if the original is Rocky Road with sprinkles this remake is just vanilla. It's not nostalgia for the 80's hit that I base my comments on but rather the messages and every-American heroism, patriotism, rugged-individualism, and freedom that contributed to the original's charm that were lacking in this retelling. The characters weren't as deeply developed, instead we got more special effects.  Another complaint was that the vast and cinematic Colorado wilderness shots were replaced with a none-to-far-away urban landscape where our heroes could easily sneak into a Subway, thrift store, or auto garage to resupply.  It was also disappointing that instead of only getting real military expertise/help later in their war the Wolverines were lead by an experienced Marine combat veteran right from the get-go.  The 21st century Wolverines had a shallower and much easier time than their 1980's counterparts and this blunts a lot of the potential drama and character arcs.

I still liked the original one better, but that one's very dated. This new movie brings the perspective of an American invasion into current times (2013 -  in case this review is read in 30 years).

As for the story, lots of action which is a plus in my book, but the plot has almost no set up.

The times it tried to pull in elements from the original movie...it was almost comical. To modernize this story line was a poor choice! The fact remains...you can't take a classic movie and make it better! Where is the originality anymore...all we are seeing is remakes and superhero movies!

Sure it's a bit campy, but it was interesting, and watching a bunch of high school students hiding in the mountains and fighting like partisans was fun.  This remake is plain stupid.  First in order to help with the foreign movie sales in China, the invading villian was changed from something semi-real(China) to something ridiculous(North Korea).  They threw in a few Russian advisors, but, still, North Korea invading the US?  Stupid is a kind appraisal.  Secondly, they switched the battle scenes from shootouts in the countryside and woods to urban fighting.  Again, where are partisan fighters(not suicide bombers) most effective?  In rough country.  They don't survive long if they are in big population centers.

Its better if you can suspend your disbelief when it comes to the story, but I just couldn't and that dragged down the movie for me. The old Red Dawn had the Soviets as the enemy, and it was somewhat believable because that was the middle of the cold war. This movie has the Russians in it, and its mentioned they have invaded the east coast, but it was just nonsensical trying to believe North Korea, a backwards country that cant even feed its own people, was going to have the logistical ability to invade any part of the USA even with the Russians helping.

On top of that I just couldn't get into the characters for the most part. They seemed very shallow and uninteresting, but that may also be because the movie felt rushed.

  3) the leader wouldn't show pause against hurting  us

5395480,4,B00A7MSQRK,"'Red Dawn', the remake of the 1983 John Milius classic is a worthy one indeed.

Hated by the critics but loved by fans for decades, the original had a story about Soviet troops invading the central US and dividing the country in two; a credible scenario offered up by former SecState Alexander Haig to director/producer John Milius and author Kevin Reynolds. The importance of the first film cannot be overstated; the mission to capture Saddam Hussein was called 'Operation Red Dawn' and carried out by Task Force 'Wolverine'.

Looks like a lot of fans ended up in the US military command structure. The remake, starring Chris Hemsworth ('Thor') and an excellent cast (far better than the original, quite frankly) updates the story by replacing the Soviet invaders for those pesky North Koreans. Originally, when the film was first made (it sat on the shelf for 2 years; supposedly the studio thought it's oohrah! right wing politics not favorable to liberal left candidates and released it AFTER the 2012 election) the Red Chinese were the bad guys.

They didn't like this one bit. So, the producers digitally removed all Chinese miltary insignia and flags and pasted the NK stamp on them. When released the critics mocked the the inclusion of Kim Jong Un's Stalinist nation. How could THEY threaten the US?

Guess what? They did, and do now. As part of a multinational invasion force in the film, they are given the Pacific Northwest as their target of occupation, and the film starts off straight away with returning USMC veteran (Hemsworth) and his brother (Josh Peck) caught up in a parachute drop by NK troops, and head fror the hills with their boyhood buddies. For the most part, the film follows the original- including the inspired casting of Jeffery Dean Morgan in the iconic Powers Boothe role of the first film. He even is made up to look like Boothe a bit.

Director Dan Bradley shoots the action very well, and there's lots of it.  At a tidy 114 minutes the film rarely takes a break, but when it does you have the excellent Adrianne Palicki to help sort out the young cast. You wish there was more of her in this.

Is this a great film for the ages? No.

But as an action adventure, and a snapshot of our troubled world it pretty much rocks throughout...",1364169600,,2270,4.700251889168766

Of course the movie is pretty fictional because by no means would any other country or military be able to invade US soil and attempt to take over as portrayed in the movie.

In the movie a small group of people who called themselves ""The Wolverines"" escaped from Russian control and started wreaking havoc by blowing things up, killing Russians, and stealing their weapons and tactics. The movie was exciting, high energy, and suspenseful. I thought they could have focused a little more on the character development of some of the characters. Iam not saying that there wasn't any character development because there was, but I thought they could have elaborated and went into more detail. I also thought they could have better explained the Russians overall plan and agenda.

However, I was totally wrong!  This movie does follow the original plot line of the 80's classic but also adds some of it's own twists and the cast works really well together!  The casting of the two brothers was done really well because if you didn't know any better you would think that they are related in real life.  What made this the most interesting in my opinion was seeing how it was updated using modern society gadgets, weapons and lifestyles.

This new version of the 80's classic takes the powerful premise of the original and updates it with everything Hollywood has figured out about writing in the intervening years.  Like Rob Zombie's remake of the John Carpenter classic ""Halloween,"" we find that the action doesn't start in the first two or three minutes, but rather the writers and filmmakers take a moment to establish the relationships of the primaries, to give more meaning when the you-know-what hits the fan.  All of the characters are richer and fuller, better developed in this new version, and played just as well by this new  crew as by the cast of the 80's version in their time (who were all stellar actors).

Many of the compelling situations and dilemmas that made the original so thought provoking reappear.  These are plainly not dropped in as out-of-place recycled plot mechanics included only to keep studio execs happy.  The parts they take from the original are well considered, timed right, and executed in a smart and stylish fashion.  And in every case, the issues that these events cause are resolved in a manner the original did not choose to implement.

Finally, I have to say that the ending was a big surprise.  I hate spoilers, so I won't give out any, but trust me on this -- I know the original backwards a forwards, (there are parts of it I can recite word for word, as anyone who grew up in the 80's might), and I was amazed at how well this version took the original and spun a new tale that matched the old one so well, yet stood completely on its own as a must-see.",1364083200,,1740,4.541666666666667

The only significant capability the North Korean military has is heavy artillery located on the border within range of Seoul.  They have  coastal navy and an air force filled with aging planes (which have limited range).  While the South Korean armed forces are smaller, they are far better equipped and trained, and should be able to cope with any kind of North Korean attack.  The support of U.S. naval and air power would give the South Korean military an advantage the North Koreans would be unlikely to cope with.  While a conflict in Korea might be costly -- because so many civilians live near the border -- the North Koreans would probably be defeated in a matter of weeks.  This movie presents a fantasy -- it's the U.S. which is a strong country which could not be invaded by any country, while North Korea is a small, weak country which could not survive an armed conflict.",1363824000,,1096,4.823529411764706

And like these North Korean dudes start droppin' in on their town outta planes using parachutes? And the North Koreans start attackin' the town? And, Whoa! It's like war in the little town! And like the Josh dude from Drake & Josh is really skinny now. So I was like, whoa, dude, like now he's Skinny Josh.

Anyway....So like um, the Thor dude was like a former army dude? And, yo, like, I mean, he was Thor! So Thor gets with Skinny Josh, The Hunger Games dude, the smokin' babes and the other dudes and trains them with some serious Thor style Call of Duty stuff? And Whoa! They become a rad force to be reckoned with and lay some hurt on the North Koreans. You know, and they're like, ""Not in my house, yo!"" And you know, like, the whole movie is like Twilight with no vampires meets, like, Call of Duty meets, you know, one of those CW shows with all the hot lookin' people. Sounds totally awesome right, dude?

If the way this review was written didn't annoy you and actually made the movie sound watchable, you should watch it. The reality is that 2012's Red Dawn was a ridiculous, completely implausible mess with dialogue that will grate your nerves down to the bone.",1363737600,3,1342,4.364

5395549,4,B00A7MSQRK,Red Dawn 2012 is a good movie but it is nothing compared to the original Red Dawn. The original gave time lines as when things were happening and the new version does not and if you didn't see the original you would think that everthing is happening in a matter of days and not months in the 2012 version. Even thought the special effects were great in the new version the story line is more believable in the original. If you haven't seen the original you must see it.,1363737600,,469,4.280898876404494

5395551,3,B00A7MSQRK,"When trying to remake a movie, it should be a requirement to at least be as good as the original.  Considering the original Red Dawn was made so many years ago, I suppose I assumed this movie would just be more.  More exciting, more technically enhanced, more depth.  But for me, it fell short on every level.  The characters weren't developed well, and they seemed like just random strangers for most of the movie.  Some of them were killed off rather quickly, but I didn't care, and I'm not sure if I was supposed to care or not.  The one character which elicited an emotional response from me was Darrell, who sacrificed himself for the others.  There are plenty of explosions and action scenes, which I did like.

I wish I could understand why movies keep being made using a young screw-up as a lead character.  This movie featured one too, and by the end of the movie I was hoping someone would shoot him.  His older brother Jed, played by Hemsworth, seemed at times as disconnected from his brother as I was.

To be fair, if you haven't seen the original, the movie wasn't terrible.  But having seen the original myself, I just didn't enjoy this one the way I thought I would.  I'd say wait for this movie to be put on the Special Deals list before renting it.",1363651200,,1266,4.428571428571429

5395554,3,B00A7MSQRK,"As my title suggests, this 2012 (really 2009) version of the movie is nothing like the original save for a few key tie-ins (Wolverines, etc.)  I think the original movie had a good idea, but was just poorly executed, so the producers of this one should have had a slam dunk.

** SPOILERS BELOW **
This movie reminded me of Transformers, action overshadowing story and plot.  There was enough action (albeit a little unrealistic with the weapons some of these ""kids"" were using with little or no recoil) but the action completely muddled everything.  I'm at a loss to understand what the producers and director were trying to get across to the viewer.  Why were the North Koreans (*cough* Chinese CGI) attacking?  Why were they dropping in with parachutes when the opening montage of the movie clearly pointed to cyber warfare and fighting from afar?  Why did I not get the sense of ""this is plausible"" like I did with the original?  Why did they leave out one of key points that seemed to work in the original (i.e. the war of attrition, these kids were in the woods throughout the winter with little supply and they were slowly being eliminated and fighting one another)?  Why was I not fearing the enemy?  Was I the only one that thought making Jed a marine was not going to justify how these kids were suddenly soldiers (at least in the original, it took what seemed to be a longer time period)?  Was I the only one that wasn't buying the Jed/Matt brother portrayal?  Was the goal really the communications box?  MacGuffin?!

I certainly didn't expect this movie to be a true-to-form remake of the original, but I at least expected them to fix and enhance the things that didn't work for it.

It's also good to keep in mind that this movie was finished in 2009 before a lot of the actors started to break (Hemsworth as Thor, Hutcherson as Peeta in the Hunger Games, etc.) so don't fault the actors if you think this movie was made in 2012.  They could have cast all of the original actors back in this version of the movie, in the same roles (RIP Patrick Swayze) and it still would have been terrible.",1363651200,,2104,4.526455026455026
5395555,1,B00A7MSQRK,"Saw this in movie theaters, absolutely horrible. Any good actor (aside the one from Thor, who is quite good) is killed off in the first few minutes. This leaves the viewer with a weak plot, terrible supporting cast, cheap production, and plot holes so wide I could navigate a battleship through them. When I saw someone blind firing an M249 over the top of a building, on full automatic and nothing to absorb the recoil, that's when I gave up on it.

Nevertheless, RD's a good comedy for those who like to laugh at awful movies, if you're into that.",1363564800,,549,4.49
5395556,3,B00A7MSQRK,"For the younger generation, this film may score higher; but, if you are old enough to have seen the original, you know the feel is just not there. The closing is left open as if a sequel were already in the works. For me the overall pacing of the movie was a bit rushed. The special effects in this version seems to overshadow the true grit and gut-level feeling in the original. The main point here is that if you are going to do a remake.... make sure it is damn good. Good enough that it overcomes the iconic moments of the original. I would rather it had stuck closer to the original story line and given it a modern weapons upgrade.",1363564800,,637,4.229508196721311

5395558,1,B00A7MSQRK,"So I caught like the five minutes of this movie at a friends apartment and decided to give it a chance. I liked the original Red Dawn and figured what the heck. So I rented it and now I want my two dollars back. But I fear that is a battle that is lost and now all I have is the Amazon review forum to air my frustrations and maybe ask where I can find a good oncologist.

I have two main complaints about this movie.

1) It is completely unbelievable. I grant you the original stretched it's believability. But the Soviet Union was a superpower that had Warsaw Pact allies that could have pulled off an invasion on US soil. North Korea makes a great bad guy, but despite it's bravado it's only a state because China allows it to exist. Despite the sometimes strained relationship between the US and China I can tell you that China isn't going to want it's obnoxious neighbor to invade the US, I mean, then who will shop at Wal-Mart and buy all it's wares, if North Korea is attacking its number one trading partner. That's just bad business.

Red Dawn makes up a complete fantasy, which is fine but it never sells it convincingly. North Korea has a super weapon that is apparently powered on magic that's never fully explained, they have ""help"" apparently from one Russian man who never talks and they blur a string of news reals together hoping that you don't know enough about the current global political climate to know any better. The director seemed to believe that if you say that something's happened that the audience won't be tempted to ask a follow up question.

They should have taken a page out of Homefront's book which made a Korean invasion seam plausible after years of political and economic decline in the United States and after North Korea had annexed South Korea and Japan. But I guess maybe that story had already been optioned by a better director.

2) In the original Red Dawn they got a lot of mileage out of teenagers having to go from a cushy American life to crapping in the woods and trying to survive til the end of the week. It had emotional power, and there are still images that still stay with me from that movie, such as when Patrick Swazy's character was holding the senior picture of a friend he had to kill. Or the names the Wolverines wrote on the rock to honor the friends that had fallen. It was war and it was hell.

I don't buy that this is guerrilla warfare. It seems more a weekend survivalist retreat with some poorly stage battle sequences and a fun game of capture the flag. There's some scenes that try to play homage to the original Red Dawn, such as the drinking of the deer blood, but they just fall flat. When one of the wolverines states their situation it just like Modern Warfare, I disagree. Modern Warfare was more believable.

Also Chris Hemsworth is in this movie and I hope he fired his agent. It's depressing to think that he went from the Avengers to this in less than a year.

So in conclusion, really don't waste your time on this. It's time you can't get back. So please hug your children, and kiss your wife and try to find a way to sleep. I wish I could give you back your innocence after seeing this movie, but I'm afraid that's just not possible in this post Red Dawn world.

I then read through the reviews to see why and saw that the majority of the reason why is because this is a remake and others do not like this version. Well, I have never seen this movie in any version so I had no expectations. I thought it was truly amazing and scary even at how something similar could happen. For me, I am able to watch remakes without expecting it to be like the first one and such. Otherwise, why a remake? It's too bad people can't appreciate this movie, because I sure did!

I like Chris Hemsworth as Jed, but the rest of the cast lacks the chemistry of the original movie.

For those who don't think our way of life is worth fighting for, then go ahead and give the movie one star ratings and try to censor others from watching it.  You certainly would not want them to get a sense of patriotism flowing through their veins.  America is evil, right?

For the rest of us, you will enjoy the movie tremendously.  Good acting, great special effects, and the setting in the beautiful Pacific Northwest where I live.  No matter who the enemy is in the movie, and it wasn't just the North Koreans, there is no assurance that the US won't be invaded by foreign powers one day.  History is replete of countries reaching their peak in power and then declining into oblivion.  Remember Rome.  It may very well happen here.

While there were some interesting parts and the action scenes were just what you would expect. The real problem with this version is that if you are going to make a remake of a popular classic film then you had better make a good one and it should strive to even be better than the original. This film just failed on many levels.

America is attacked by a 3rd world country that can't even produce enough electricity to light up its country at night. Korea doesn't make a realistic adversary and add to this that they can fly thousands of paratroopers and military vehicles an attack overnight is just silly.

5395616,3,B00A7MSQRK,"Red Dawn is most emphatically not, in any sense of the word, an ""intelligent"" film. There are holes the likes of which Texas could pass through, and the sheer number of characters belied whatever efforts the film might have made in giving them actual depth. That said, it wasn't awful--I enjoyed it, for what it was, and so long as you don't go into it looking for flaws, you could probably say the same.

The most jarring aspects of the film, actually, had less to do with the script and more to do with Josh Peck. There wasn't a moment he was on screen but that I was instantly yanked from scope of the film, and found myself thinking, ""Gee, couldn't he have taken some acting lessons?"" Even the sound of his voice started to get to me. Chris Hemsworth was wonderful (of course) and more or less carried the movie on his own; I believed what his character said and felt, and genuinely rooted for him. I didn't so much watch the movie as I watched him. -spoiler- Killing him off at the end effectively killed my emotional attachment to the movie, and if the movie had gone on much longer I probably would have turned it off. The idea of Josh Peck's character as the new leader was laughable--dumb as a box of tacks, a solo artist without the slightest regard for others (unless it's his girlfriend, who, let's be frank, changes absolutely nothing once she does reappear, except that now his schmucky attitude has no grounds) and, apparently, zero ability to shoot straight--how many bullets did he fire off at the N. Korean soldiers in the police department before he actually hit one?

Walter Dean Myers was a smart addition to the cast list--and was subsequently wasted entirely. He had absolutely no point, except to represent the aging military retiree quotient, and possibly the new-world ideal of Free America's Military Strength. He's capable of a lot more, though, and with Chris Hemsworth alongside, they could have rocked the house. Instead he was a third-tier character in a plot composed almost entirely of third-tier characters, and I was left wondering why they'd introduced them at all, except to deliver intelligence that the box was somehow important. (There's a word for that, and it's called a MacGuffin.)

If you enjoy action flicks, but aren't looking to think too hard about it, this movie will satisfy your rainy-day needs. I'd rent it--this isn't a movie to buy or even to rewatch with any great frequency. Save yourself the cash.",1363219200,3,2455,4.717948717948718

5395637,2,B00A7MSQRK,"Everything that made the original great, this new version just flushed down the toilet. The action is suppose to be gritty and ugly, and instead this version has the kids doing parkour, what!? The brothers Jed and Matty story is just the old ""You weren't around"" storyline. So they are bickering like an old married couple the entire time. Matty for some reason wants to risk everything for his high school chick that the movie spends 27 seconds on building their relationship. So you basically just roll your eyes every time he wants to free her and risk his groups life. Most, if not all the action takes place in the town, rather then on the outskirts in the wilderness like the original. The problem with that? I think the badguys would eventually get around to preventing outsiders from entering, or having people walk around freely. The orignal they walked around for supplies and news every now and again, but didn't cause much trouble in town. Speaking of badguys, it was suppose to be the Chinese invading, but since Paramount wanted to sell their movie to China, they had it quickly changed to the North Koreans, which makes no sense because they have a hard time even feeding themselves over there.

Timeline is another problem. The first one showed you every month and it gave you a perspective of how long these kids have been at war. The new version does no such thing. We get a training montage for a few minutes, then its attack attack attack. No slow falls, but people are wearing thick jackets, and its football season (since the opening is a football game). So is this movie just taking place in like September-October? Maybe they are in the one mountainous area of Spokane, WA where it does not snow? I dunno. But without snow, and during football season, the moving is basically saying its only taking place for like two month timeline. Not enough for training, and all those attacks. And then the movie is only 92 minutes, which leads me to believe a bunch was cut from the movie. Its hard to build characters and a good story in 92 minutes. And the worse part ever, the movie just plain wussed out when it came to the Daryl and the tracking device side-story. If PG-13 Hunger games can do kid-on-kid brutality, I think Red Dawn could have pulled it off as well.

5395657,4,B00A7MSQRK,"Okay, I loved the old eighties version of RED DAWN and I must have watched it, like, a thousand times. So I rented this one to see how they would do with remaking this one...Only the theme was the same. No, only the IDEA of the same theme prevailed. This movie was much more advanced in pyrotechnics and much less 'character' intense than the old one. The action was nonstop in this one as well. The old nemesis, Russia,  was there, but the adoption of Northern Korea was really disturbing in its believability. Not so much as the mass soldier count in the movie, but the implication of true life conflict had a very real creepiness. The bond between the brothers Jed and Mannie ( not sure about the spelling there) was just as profound in this newer version, but I feel it lacked the gut wrenching sadness I felt when they died together on the bench at the end of the older movie. I'm trying to keep from doing a comparison instead of a review here, but it's hard not to. They're just very different, but then again the same. It might be just because you get really used to some things, like old songs and the remakes just don't cut it, so, honestly (sorry) I like the first version better, but this new Red Dawn is really fast paced and the younger crowd will probably disagree with me on this..once again I urge anyone whom has not seen the older version, rent them together and see what you think!

5395678,3,B00A7MSQRK,"Chris Hemsworth (Jed Eckert), Josh Peck (Matt Eckert) and Josh Hutcherson (Robert) star in this remake of the classic 1984 film.  This time, instead of the Russians invading the United States, it's the North Koreans.

Hemsworth, Peck, and Hutcherson reprise the roles made famous by Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, and C. Thomas Howell.  And instead of taking place in the slopes of the Rocky Mountains, this new movie is an urban struggle.

The story is much the same: The United States is invaded by an over-zealous regime bent on capturing the United States while bestowing their political beliefs on a scared American populace.  Enter the ""Wolverines"": a group of kids forced from their homes and faced with fighting against a superior enemy in order to stay alive.

As was true in the first movie, the Wolverines surprise the enemy with hit-and-run tactics, causing confusion, and killing as many of the bad guys as possible.  They are also trying to capture a sophisticated piece of electronics which could help their cause.  They are successful for a time, but the North Koreans will not go quietly.

This was an ok movie, but, in my opinion, the original was better.  The acting is average at best, and many of the same lines and encounters are drawn directly from the first movie.  Even some of the dialogue is the same.

I did enjoy watching this movie, but I felt that it was a let-down from the original.  Hemsworth and Peck are only average as the Eckert brothers, and Hutcherson lacks a lot of C. Thomas Howell's original aggressiveness as Robert.

I can only give a luke-warm endorsement of the new Red Dawn.  As is the case with most re-makes, the original is much better.",1362960000,,1687,4.768965517241379

Honestly as soon as I saw that a ""Teen Nick"" Actor was to play in an action move role, I knew I couldn't expect much.

Leading Role Cast: B. Chris Hemsworth was excellent, however the ""Drake ad Josh"" star (I forget his name) literally threw off any expectations I had for this movie.

Plot: B+. North Koreans invades a small town in the US. Possible? Yes with some help. Reality? NO. There is no full explanation how they got around our defenses until towards the end of the movie. My question throughout the whole thing was where the f*** was our government? The last bit of hope is left up to a small group of town people who have NO military training except for Hemsworth being in the marines. He teaches them the basics and all of a sudden they become such experts they made the special forces look bad.

Acting: D. Not much to say. It was a failure.

Holy S*** Factor: A. There were some points in the film that made you jump like DAMN did that really happen? That honestly kept my interest in it.

Overall this movie is on par with Battleship and I can't even say if it's worth renting. Maybe on a rainy day when there is nothing else on the TV to watch. THEN you might slightly enjoy it.",1362960000,,1360,4.2153846153846155

5395684,4,B00A7MSQRK,"Let me start by saying this review will have spoiler information regarding both versions of this movie.

PLOT

Communists invade the USA and start an occupation while freedom fighters use guerrilla warfare to expel the enemies from their land.  The Plot for both movies is pretty much identical.

SETTING

1984 Version is set in the mid western town of Calumet Colorado.

2012 Version is set in Seattle and Spokane Washington but is said to encompass Oregon and Washington States as occupied by the North Koreans.

ENEMIES

1984 featured Cuban and Nicaraguan aggressors attacking the USA after a communist Coup in Mexico...  Russians later joined in by attacking Alaska and pushing down through Canada.

2012 features North Korea attacking two states while other agressors like Cuba and Russia attack California and the East Coast...  Again, the Russians join the assault later and provide Intel to the North Koreans.

REVIEW

Okay, as you probably already know this film is more like a Reboot than a Remake.

First, we are supposed to suspend belief in the 1984 version and assume that a group of kids with no real military training were able to fight off the Cubans and Soviets...  In the 2012 version, the lead character was an Iraq war veteran who provided the training for the kids so that is a major improvement over the original movie.

Second, we're being told that the North Koreans are a less formidable enemy than the Nicaraguans and Cubans when this simply is not true; North Korea has the worlds 4th Largest Army and they have Nukes!  Both movies had the main aggressor receiving Russian backing so neither has an advantage there.  Bottom line, North Koreans in Spokane is a hell of a lot more believable than Cubans in Colorado.

Third, the first movie alludes to an eventual purge of the occupiers by Americans but, we're left with no details about how or who finished the fight.  In the new movie, they're joined by 3 Marines looking for a communications device that will be used to crack the encrypted communication of our enemies and we're given a lot more information about what is happening in other parts of the country.  We also see more and more people joining the Wolverines as the resistance grows and we have a pretty good idea who expels the enemies and how they do it.

Fourth, Where are all the actors from the original movie now?  Of the two most notable, one is dead and the other killed the number 1 comedy on TV only to create a second rate version of the show later on.  Most of the other, we likely will never hear from again.  The new cast has a few that have already been in big movies and are likely to have decent careers...  It also features new actors who could have a very bright future of their own.  The bottom line is that neither movie has any oscar winners as of this time but, the odds favor the new group of at least having one.

MISCONCEPTIONS

There's an assumption that the kids planned to get their food from Subway, and this simply is not true...  They ducked into the subway sandwich shop and didn't even realize they where they were but, upon realizing it they robbed the place for food.

Another assumption is that their feature phone wouldn't work even though the power is out...  Again, this isn't true as the Grid is the only thing that is down, if it were an actual EMP device many of the cars would have had issues with their electrical systems as well.  What actually happened was likely a Cyber Attack on the grid as all the news articles leading up to the power outage discuss that as the #1 threat to America.

CONCLUSION

The old movie was nostalgic and a cult classic but, lets not try to paint it as the best film ever, it simply was not!  The new film is actually an upgrade in many areas and perhaps the North Koreans couldn't develop some type of Non-Nuclear EMP device or even get close to our shore line but, they are infinitely more capable of wreaking havoc than the Cubans were in 1984 (Sorry but, the Cubans couldn't blink without us knowing which eye blinked first).  This movie stands as a decent movie all around and neither the acting nor the story is as bad as many are making this out to believe.

Here's a little piece of trivia for you...

John Milius (who directed and co-wrote the 1984 Screenplay for Red Dawn) created a videogame called Homefront in which those invading America were the North Koreans.  Funny that he would see it as plausible but, some second rate reviewers and nostalgia buffs dismiss the idea huh?",1362873600,,4506,4.590738423028786

5395686,4,B00A7MSQRK,"Having seen the original movie when it first came out (yes I am older lol) I wanted to see this updated version. More special effects and action was too much compared with the emotionality of the previous movie. Action and Adventure is fine but overpowered the emotional connection of some of the actors.
In the original the Father played a more significant role. I would loved to have seen more 'survival in the woods, suffering for food etc. and less 'blow it up' which it seems predominates movies these days.
The ending in the original was much better.",1362873600,,556,4.683673469387755

I had no illusion that the 2012 version would be as good as the original, but cripes was this remake bad. Character development was virtually non-existent for the supporting cast as the new version decided to focus on the relationship between Matt and Erika, an ironic decision given that Josh Peck (Matt) turned in the most annoying on-screen performance in recent memory. I can't help but think his acting future has been jeopardized by his portrayal as Matt. The plot wandered here and there with no real purpose. The characters beyond Matt and Jed were best described by another reviewer as ""cardboard"". There was no depth to anyone in this movie.

Oh sure, the Chinese would have been more believable, but it aint the North Koreans alone.  Plenty of action, a solid plot, that there was a way to destroy communications and the electrical grid with a new weapon, I mean, it seems the Chinese are working on doing something with computers against the USA a lot recently, so not so far fetched.

The original film flows like it came from an artist painting a vision. The original film had actual flying helicopters, fixed wing aircraft as well as a very authentic looking soviet T-72s and zsu-23-4s and real people on parachutes. In the new film there are zero real aircraft flying and within the first two minutes of the invasion the ""bad guys"" are driving U.S. hummers and M-1 tanks with no explanation ever given as to how ""they"" aquired these vehicles in such a rapid fashion.

This was very much a story of American values, the fight for survival, and mustering up the courage to do what's right in the face of sure death.  This is very much the story of two evil empires (Russia and North Korea) attempting to bring the greatest nation on Earth down, and failing because we are much more than a nation of people.  When it boils down to it, we are a nation of God fearing, freedom loving people who will fight you until one of us is dead to preserve what is right and good on this planet.  This movie was all about that.  I loved how the fight started with the older brother, a U.S. Marine, instilling the Marine Corps values into his younger brother, and the other kids.  I also loved when the retired Marines jumped in, portraying the ""Once a Marine, Always a Marine"".

5395718,1,B00A7MSQRK,"I can count on one hand the number of good remakes I have seen in my lifetime. The Thing, The Fly, and Terrence Malick's Thin Red Line are all examples of remakes that trumped the original films. Last year's rehash of Red Dawn is likely to go down in the record books as the worst remake in cinematic history.

Growing up in the '80s, I have a soft spot in my heart for the original Red Dawn (1984). As implausible an idea of a joint Soviet/Cuban invasion was, somehow John Milius not only made the premise work, but injected a frightful sense of stark realism into his story. Red Dawn (1984) was a very atmospheric film, and a subtle character study of two reluctant leaders, Col. Bella (Ron O'Neal) and Jed Eckert (Patrick Swayze). Watching a group of scared high school kids develop into hardened partisans seemed natural and logical. And their eventual dissolution was heartbreaking. I can watch the 1984 Red Dawn over and over and it never loses its punch, despite its flaws.

The remake is devoid of any redeeming qualities whatsoever. I will attempt to break down the most glaring problems with this film as I see them.

Chris Hemsworth as Jed Eckert: Hemsworth might as well have been playing Thor again. He never made any leadership mistakes; he demonstrated no crisis of conscience; he could make the ""Wolverines"" fall in line at the drop of a hat with a glare and some silly, ham-fisted dialogue. The original Jed was just an average joe with some wilderness survival skills. Hemsworth's Jed was a battle-tested Marine, so he was a warrior right off the bat.

I can't really blame the actor for a bad screenplay, but the 2012 Jed Eckert never had to level a gun at a comrade turned traitor; never made the mistake of falling into a well-laid enemy trap; never held a childhood photo and cried to himself at the innocence and camaraderie he lost. No, Hemsworth never faced anything resembling a challenge. And for that, his portrayal of Jed Eckert failed miserably. Patrick Swayze's Jed was a very flawed leader whose decisions were sometimes terribly wrong and, one could argue, led to the deaths of his friends and his own brother. That made his character all the more real. In contrast, Hemsworth's Jed didn't really face any trial he wasn't already trained to handle.

Matt Eckert: Whoever played this character turned in the most wooden performance of the movie. He was completely unconvincing as Jed's brother. His rallying speech at the end was a complete joke. I'd have rather watched a drunken, middle-aged Charlie Sheen reprise this role than the kid they cast as Jed's younger brother.

Robert: In the '84 version, C. Thomas Howell's Robert was my favorite character. He progressively became the most rabid Wolverine of the lot, and went out fighting against all odds. His death underscored the futility of partisan warfare. I was wondering when Robert was going to turn into the hardened killer in this version. Unfortunately, I found the Robert of this film to be an afterthought. A complete cypher.

The Enemy: North Korea? Are you kidding me? It was a big enough leap to think that the Soviets could end up on US soil in '84...but North Korea in 2012? That stretches things into the realm of impossibility, even though they're supposed to be a part of some ""Asian Communist coalition."" The enemy in this film posed no threat at all to the Wolverines, yet still managed to take over the Pacific Northwest. Their commander, Capt. Cho, was a one-dimensional cardboard cutout -- a far cry from O'Neal's Bella in the '84 version (or William Smith's Strelnikov, for that matter).

Andy Tanner: Recasting Powers Boothe's original grounded ""Eagle Driver"" was another major let-down. They should have just left Tanner out of the film. No depth of character was displayed -- Jeffrey Dean Morgan's Tanner, recast as a Marine, was all action and ""oo-rah!"" 2012's Andy Tanner was as pointless and wooden as Capt. Cho. You would think that Tanner and his motivated teammates could have shown a little humility about their battle readiness -- after all, in this film, we'd just gotten whipped by a country that can't even feed its own people.

The Dialogue: Forced. We get an unhealthy dose of simpleton patriotism to explain why the Wolverines are fighting; why they ""need to stay and fight""; why they are going to fight, etc. It took several painful scenes of bad dialogue to convey their convictions and motives. When asked ""what makes us different from them?"" in the '84 version, Swayze's Jed summed it up in one sentence. ""Because we live here."" That simple answer was a thousand times more convincing than any bit of rah-rah jingoism vomited forth from anyone in the remake.

Erica and Toni: Why did the screenwriter bother with these two? In the '84 Red Dawn, Erica (Lea Thompson) and Toni (Jennifer Grey) were spirited and could slug it out with the other guys, no questions asked. In the remake, the pair never showed anything resembling grit, combat fatigue, or any emotion besides blank stares when they weren't fawning over the Eckert brothers.

Atmosphere: The atmosphere of 2012's Red Dawn was the equivalent of watching someone else play an urban-warfare first person shooter on the Xbox 360. An hour and 30-odd minutes of the ""Wolverines"" blowing things up and then returning to the safety of their ""underground base"" got real old, real fast. In the '84 version, battlefields looked like the real deal; you could feel the cold, miserable conditions the Wolverines were living in; you could tell they were hungry, tired, and breaking down. None of that was present here. It seemed like freedom was just a car ride away, rather than a near-impossible trek through enemy lines.

Also, Milius didn't waste time taking the viewer into the action in '84. In the original version, you see a few location shots of Calumet, Colorado to establish the identity of the town, then you're smack dab in the middle of a high school history class when paratroopers fall from the sky. There was no CGI back then, so this all looked and felt completely real. Here, you have a typical teen movie lead-up, where time is wasted on a freaking football game! Then, you get to suffer through at least 10 minutes of pointless character introductions -- pointless because the characters are never really developed in the movie at all. About 15 minutes in, the CGI invaders fall from the sky with absolutely no sense of menace at all. Yawn.

Score: Basically, there was none to speak of. Basil Poledouris' dynamic soundtrack from 1984 could have been easily worked into this film as a motif by the composer. Instead, the director and producers took the video game route: they opted for a soundtrack that was lifeless and dull, and blended innocuously into the background.

I could go on for days with a list of problems that made this retooling a complete farce, but I'll leave you with this: either save your money or just watch the original film. Either way, you won't be disappointed.

I can't say the same if you rent or buy the 2012 remake of Red Dawn.

5395719,3,B00A7MSQRK,"Red Dawn isn't a great movie, but I was entertained. I appreciated the momements of omage to the original, plus the whole movie was a preservation of the ""yeah, right"" feel that the 80's movie was. Impossible situations, but you can still appreciate the outcomes. One thing that surprised me was the lack of gore and death. Shootings were often done off screen and after all the bombings, you never saw heaps of flesh. The original 1980's movie opening, which was pretty shocking to me (teacher and kids getting shot, hanging out of the school windows) was not replicated at all, really.

SPOILERS AHEAD

I'm posting as my review a comment I actually posted on another reviewer's thread, because it really sums up how bad this movie is.

The original ""Red Dawn"" is a classic, flaws and all. It captured the feeling of the era in which it was made, when we conservatives saw small-town America as the strength and possible salvation of this country's future.

Right, wrong or indifferent, that's the way it was.

This remake is... I don't know... the video era's idea of ""values""? A video game writ large on the big screen?

No matter what, it sucks.

Further, here are the ""spoiler"" comments I wrote on the other reviewr's thread:

""SPOILERS AHEAD!

""Not only is your review spot on in its content, but this lameoid 'remake' completely ignores MAJOR plot points of the original.

""What happened to the betrayal by one of the Wolverines? And their administration of justice? What about the Soviet Spetznas commander, and his imposition of martial law, as portrayed by uber Bad Guy William Smith in the original? In this version, we see the blue beret SpecOps commander, but he's meaningless in the movie. Which, of course in the original, led to the invaders' commander having grave second thoughts about their purpose. COM-PUH-LETELY ignored on this version. Which kind of negates the MAIN plot point of the original.

""This movie sucked, big time.""

Add to that the absolutely and completely absurd premise that North Korea -- which can't even invade adjoining SOUTH Korea -- successfully invaded US!!!!!

You kidding me? Who wrote this? Kim Jong Un's press secretary? The same idiots who thought the Onion's article naming him an international sex symbol was a real news article?

5395744,2,B00A7MSQRK,"I had the (mis?)fortune of seeing Red Dawn on opening day.  My original intent was to see the movie with a group of friends.  Plans fell through, which was unfortunate, because it turned out to the kind of film that makes one want to make snide remarks to the person next to you.  Given all the sarcastic, MST3K-esque riffing I wanted to do on the film while watching it, Red Dawn will surely be a fantastic film to rent on a bad movie night with you and any budding cynics you know.  Without the benefit of satirical commentary layered on top like sweet sprinkles on a burnt, stale confectionary, though, the movie loses almost all appeal.

Despite a pretty decent cast, including Chris Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson, nobody seems to care that they're even in this film.  It's clearly an ""I just need my paycheck"" situation for most of these actors, and none of them put forth any effort to inject their characters with any likeability, or any real identity at all.  I can't imagine they've been given much to work with from the writers, but that doesn't exactly give them a free pass to coast through the films interminable running time.

Beyond being a mere bad film, though, Red Dawn is unique in just how out of place it feels in today's culture.  What would have made at least some sense in the `80's now comes off as comically far-fetched in the remake.  The sight of hundreds of North Korean paratroopers landing in a white-bread American suburb no longer invokes the latent fear surrounding the Cold War, but merely raises eyebrows at its implausibility.  If this was merely meant to be a goofy thrill ride, it might be easy to ignore, but the film spends its entire length in wide-eyed certainty of the world it's created.  Clearly, we are meant to think THIS COULD HAPPEN.

Little needs to be said about the plot that can't be summarized in a few sentences.  North Korea invades the US.  The nation is steamrolled.  Our group of plucky young Americans fights back.  Characters are broadly-stroked splashes of color, with little depth beyond a specific character trait we can identify them by (The Leader, The Rebel, The Brains, The... erm... Blond Girl?).  As the story progresses, they all learn lessons about Heroism, Family, and Love.  Also, Guns.  Lots of guns.

If anything, that's one thing the movie gets right.  Those involved in making Red Dawn seem to have hit on the fact that they have crafted the perfect fantasy for anyone who ever invented a heroic story for their toy soldiers.  The pace is as relentless as a ten-year-old making his little tale of crazy heroism.  Guns are followed by more guns, explosions by bigger explosions, car chases by more reckless chases in army transports, all topped with an ever-increasing atmosphere of frenzied action and wanton destruction.  There's a certain joy in it, and it's certainly the film my friends and I would have tried to make back in elementary school.

Unfortunately, most of us I assume want something a little more substantial.  But despite a relatively talented cast, no one here really rises to the occasion to make anything more of the film than the absurd war-fantasy it is.  My advice: wait for it to come out on video, and make it the crown jewel of your next bad-movie night.",1362528000,6,3260,4.701940035273369

Is it different from the original, yes.  Both the original and this version have the same basic story, but with little differences.  If you want an ""exact"" remake (which is ridiculous to expect), then don't watch this.  It is not an exact remake.

5395746,3,B00A7MSQRK,"hey all first off let get to the elephant in the room, this movie  IS NOT LIKE THE ORIGINAL!!! there are a lot of differences and the emotional connection that the original had is not present, and while there are times where this movie improves the scenes of the original the original will always be the better one. Another thing I want to say I am very disappointed in the makers for not adding anything to the blu ray which is why I got the dvd. In this day and age if hey want more of our money for a blu ray they need to add something more than just a digital copy. If you can get past these and some other issues you will see a pretty good movie

the action sequences are done well, there are times were the jerky camera can take away from the scene but all in all the action sequences all pretty good.

Chris Helmsworth, and josh peck do grab you as brothers, and Jeffery dean Morgan is believable as a member of the free American army, and the rest while they try they really don't hold you but many of them do show potential.

The story this is where the movie kinda has a little problem, there are major plot holes in the story that are never truly resolved or explained there are times where you got to kinda ask why this or that happened but these are far between, but are still there never the less and the ending while good could have been better.

Special features This is where I really got disappointed I was ready to buy the blu ray but when I saw that the only extra they offered was a digital copy I got the dvd instead. Film district and many other studios need to realize that in order to get our hard earned movie for blu ray they need to add more than just a digital copy. I was very disappointed that the blu ray did not offer anything more substantial special feature than a digital copy.

still these are not big problems and the movies is something unique there has not been many America invaded films for awhile and while this is good it could have been better.",1362528000,,1989,4.193717277486911

It is tough to compare a remake or reinvisioning especially this one since it's been so many years between the two. For shoot 'em up action movies, I'm ok if the character development is not too deep. I want to see the action. Red Dawn 2012 moves a little quicker as far as showing the Wolverines making their move on the offensive. I didn't mind that that but the ending was a little too abrupt. I gave it 3 stars because I spent $23 bucks for it...DOH! Is it worth seeing - yes. Is it worth owning - maybe if you have the extra cash to burn. If not rent it or borrow from a friend.

one thing about this film does puzzle me. In the opening credits they showcased Obama,

President Obama? If it was Hollywood's intent to make him look good then they actually failed here.

Maybe they assumed a lot of young liberals would like it? Maybe that is why they flashed Obama around in the beginning. But if you go back to the original film, most of the people watching that were of a conservative mind set. Pro gun, pro America,pro military, survival of the fittest, fight for your freedom kind of people. I think they were trying to target the wrong audience. Anyways, I am an old foegie and I was a fan of the original. I don't get too stuck on the past though. I do like to see a remake well done. Because now when I go watch the original I think the acting was just horrible and the special effects was well.... Laughable? So I like the story and could not wait to see a better more powerful acting and special effects. The movie(SPOILER ALERT) doesn't suggest if Americans win or not. The acting could of been better. I think Hemsworth did the best job. But then it was hard to tell with the others since none of them really talked that much. There was not a lot of character development for them.

How North Korea could even find the fuel to get several boatloads of its undernourished troops over here is never explained.  Whatever.

Yes, this one is a disappointment.  But that does not mean that it is not entertaining; in fact it is.  I found it to be enjoyable, and it is great fun, as always, watching the Wolverines wasting the bad guys with AR 15s and other assault rifles.  RJB.",1362268800,,819,4.47972972972973

If you were a fan of the original, do yourself a favor and skip this one - your fond memory's will be trampled on beyond repair. Worse, the screenplay looks to have been inspired by Stormship Troopers. Someone needs to tell the writer(s) that Stormship Troopers was a tongue-and-cheek view of the military - and SST pulled it off. Red Dawn is supposed to be a gritty movie about teenagers coming of age during war much like the French freedom fighters during WWII. The writer(s) attempted to cloak the fact they were stealing from a over-the-top Sci-Fi film until the end where they actually became so lazy they just used the actual ending from Stormship Troopers - seriously, go watch it.

There were so many flaws in the scenery, the acting, the setting, the mood, the feel... I could go on and on, but the one thing I just couldn't stand (the most) was North Korea as the enemy. The nation is so impoverished that they couldn't afford the gas money let alone the equipment, technology, or sustainable manpower to even attempt this in their own continent much less on the other side of the world. Even the U.S. has trouble keeping more than three carrier groups out at sea. The writer(s)(again) were so lazy they didn't even try to come up with a viable story how N.K. could even attempt it. In the first movie the writer(s) knew their limitations and let the audience put the pieces together themselves.

Sorry, I just can't go on. This movie actually upset my stomach, it was that bad. The only reason I could watch it to the end was out of pure grotesque morbidity.

There is prepositions and then is Red Dawn. This remake of the 1980's brat pack cold war thriller gets a dust off for the modern generation, who I sincerely hope is not stupid enough to buy into this stuff. Where the 1984 had an immediacy regarding it's subject, Red Dawn now plays about as serious a video game.

Red Dawn starts out pretty dreadful and uninspired and just goes down hill from there. The basic premise is still the same only our enemies have changed. Instead of the Soviets attacking middle American we get invaded by North Korea this time, originally it was to be China, but North Korea is far believable. Yeah, right.

Pretty much everything is the same, the characters are identical as before. At least those who haven't been reduced to non speaking roles. There are small tweaks to the script sure, I mean there is no traitor in their mitts. This version of Red Dawn is entirely wholesome and pro-American, Americans wouldn`t do that.

If you don't know, this is the story of how the Spokane Wolverines high school football team and some cheerleaders fight WWIII. At least lead character Jed Eckert (Chris Hemsworth) is a marine on leave from Iraq, you know for creditability. So, Jed is able to train the high schoolers in the art of combat and military strategy in roughly ten minutes time. They make war and there acts of terrorism, I mean defiance, look easy. In the 1984 original if you will remember nearly the entire cast, name stars and all, die by the movie's conclusion. Not here, the Wolvines suffer a body count of three, if I remember correctly.

Chocked full of silly chest thumping patriotism and corny heroic theme music which do much to undermine the already lousy movie. That the movie has a pro-war message that tells us that war is heroic and fun, maybe we should all join. up, is far more offensive than anything in the controversial Zero Dark Thirty. Call it G.I. Junior.

Red Dawn has an endless stream of poorly filmed shaky cam action scenes. The villains are not given much personality, they exist only to be shot and killed. And there is an awful lot of shooting going on, if the illogical shoot `em up scenes which take pace in places like the heavily enemy occupied downtown Spokane, then the loud gunfire will serve  as headache inducing. .

The cast is game though, young rising stars like Hemsworth, Josh Hutcherson, Josh Peck, Adrianne Palicki and Isabel Lucas all give adequate performances given this poor material and crappy script. However, Red Dawn only really perks up when Jeffrey Dean Morgan shows up late in the game, but his role too is underwritten and he has far to little screen time.

Red Dawn lacks immediacy and as well as tension. Thee isn't even much false apprehension to be found. Nothing at all happens that is unexpected. The script is from the hack specialists Carl Ellsworth and Jeremy Passmore, it is predictable even to those who are not familiar with the original.

What stuntman turned first time director Dan Bradley has done to Red Dawn is reduce it to a violent Noxima Commercial. Where the original was from visionary filmmaker John Milius, co-author of the seminal Apocalypse Now. This new version is clearly from a guy who doesn't know his arse from a movie camera, he lacks any sort of style and his film lacks any and all substance or character depth. The Red Dawn redux is 93 minutes of pain and misery felt by a paying audience who will now know what it is like to be ripped off, it is overlong by about ninety minutes.

It should be noted that Red Dawn is not a new movie. In fact it was made in 2009, that means it was Hemsworth's first starring role even before Thor, it's been collecting dust all this time and should still be doing so. And you know what, it is astounding how dated a movie can look after only three years. I bet it won't take another three years to forget that this movie was even ever made.

5395807,1,B00A7MSQRK,"""Dude, we're living Call of Duty. And it sucks.""

So says a character in Red Dawn 2012, succinctly summing up the movie. This film purports to be a remake of John Milius's 1984 cult classic about a group of American teens who band together to fight back against communist invaders but don't be fooled. In reality Dawn 2012 is a poor man's version of the Red Dawn inspired missions from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (where the Russians invade America).

Dawn 2012, like too many blockbusters, feels like a movie assembled by a committee to say nothing and offend no-one, to be as safe and commercial as possible. I am glad to say that in this case second guessing the lowest common denominator didn't pay-off and that Dawn 2012 flopped at the box office. The original Red Dawn isn't a perfect movie - the script is a bit disjointed and the acting could be better - but at least it has convictions. At least it takes some risks. At least it has a director who is passionate about the material (which he also co-wrote). And it shows in every scene of the film.

The original Red Dawn is a celebration of rugged individualism and ordinary people rising to the occasion; the remake, not so much. In Dawn 1984 the heroes are average kids. But in the remake the kids are led by a marine. In the original the characters live off the land as best they can. In the remake the group are never far from occupied civilisation and steal food from a miraculously open Subway. In the original as the war wears on the characters get dirty and get tougher. In the remake everyone always looks perfectly made up and no-one ever has to make any truly difficult decisions. The original is pretty damn cheesy and unrealistic in places, often endearingly so, but it's just as often shocking and provocative. The remake on the other hand is one implausible and/or ridiculous thing after another with none of the charm of the sillier aspects of the original.

But maybe it's unfair to compare Dawn 2012 with some old movie from the 80's especially since the film mainly seems to emulate a more recent property. Like its videogame counterparts in Modern Warfare 2, Dawn 2012 takes place in urban environments, as opposed to the small town and surrounding wilderness setting of the original. Ramin Djawadi's score is almost indistinguishable from the music that plays underneath the gunfire in Call of Duty. Like a videogame shoot-em-up Dawn 2012 is action from start to finish. The plot and characters are barely fleshed out. The film is shot and edited in a way that tries to evoke the experience of blasting away bad guys from behind a controller but fails to do so due to an overreliance on shaky-cam and rapid cutting.

So what's Dawn 2012 like judged on its own, without any comparisons to... Oh yeah... I should mention that the Australians have their own version of Red Dawn in the form of a long series of books. I don't know whether or not author John Marsden knew about Dawn 1984 before writing Tomorrow, When the War Began and its sequels (Wikipedia says he didn't) but his work functions as a better remake than the official remake. The film adaption of the first book on the other hand is even more vacuous than Dawn 2012 and should be avoided.

Tomorrow has the same libertarian ideals as Dawn 1984. It's a similar blend of goofy heroics and hard hitting dramatic moments. Tomorrow and Dawn 1984 are products of creators who are in love with their respective countries. In Tomorrow, the teen resistance fighter Ellie, who narrates the series, writes frequently of her affection for her land, its people and their way of life. The original Red Dawn is filled with gorgeous landscape shots. The movie is saying this is what America looks like, this is what it FEELS like. At the end of his movie Milius has one of his antagonists realise that unlike the protagonists he will never belong to the landscape. The Red Dawn remake is superficially patriotic. It has a few shots of the American flag and couple of lines about how ""this is our home!"" and ""freedom!"" but it never shows the viewer why America is a cause worth fighting and dying for.

Anyway, where was I... the Red Dawn remake, on its own merits. Basically, it sucks. But hopefully from everything I've said you've already gathered that. There are much better movies (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-original-Red-Dawn/dp/B005QG2DGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the original Red Dawn</a>) videogames (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Call-of-Duty-Modern-Warfare-2/dp/B00269QLI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2</a>) and books (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tomorrow-When-the-War-Began/dp/0439829100/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tomorrow, When the War Began</a>) that you can invest your time and money in.",1360368000,370,4890,5.105

I'm convinced now that no modern western filmmaker can ""do insurgent"" any more. There's just too much disconnect between the writers and directors of today because they've never known what it's like to be subjugated, threatened and terrified. We're never going to see the kinds of films like we did after WW2, when so many creators literally lived through the various horrors of war, including being conquered by an invading enemy.

Read a story once told by a comic book artist. When he was a young man and first tried his hand at illustration, all he had were comic books to teach him. It took many months of hard work, but he finally completed his first project. Impressed and praising himself for the effort and energy he had put into it, he took the art to the publishers thinking he would be hired on the spot. He wasn't.

In fact, he was quickly and repeatedly dismissed. Confused, frustrated, and hurt, he finally asked one of the editors 'why' no one was interested. The editor, seeing that the young artist was suffering, took time out of his busy schedule, sat him down and explained that his work was junk. Why? Because he hadn't studied and learned from real life. A comic book is already a highly interpretive form of art, and when you copy and learn from a skewed version of reality, in turn, your version is utterly bleeped. He told him to take proper art classes, learning to draw from life and studying under qualified teachers, so that only when he was truly ready, he should try again.

Readily applicable advice to filmmakers.

Writers/directors need to experience the event, live the life, do the deed before putting their concepts into scripts. At the very least, do an intense exploration of the topic they're going to film. Otherwise, it's not a depiction of reality but a distorted caricature. For example: In the scene when the young would-be insurgents throw away food. Talk to survivors of invasions and they'll either laugh in your face or knock you upside your head for suggesting throwing away anything, much less food. During the Siege Of Leningrad - the populace ended up eating their cats and dogs - before turning to cannibalism.

Disconnected = Falsity.

This reboot is reflective of so many films today: Superficial, underdeveloped and plastic. In this case, one doesn't really believe they're a bunch of kids who have suffered under the brutal thumb of oppression, much less worked their way to becoming unconventional combatants.

I hesitated on this next part because I'm essentially committing plagiarism. To be fair, I'm plagiarizing myself. But I don't see the point of duplicating work already completed. So, from my review of ""Tomorrow When The War Began"" --- Why does everyone's makeup look so even throughout the movie? One of the reasons the original 'Red Dawn' worked was you could see how plain everyone was being virtually makeup free. And, most importantly, looked progressively worse as the film went on - which of course makes complete sense. I'm thinking specifically of Lea Thompson and Jennifer Grey who were almost unrecognizable by the movie's final. That all the females had their hair and makeup intact throughout the flick doomed this to Hollywood ridiculousness.

And I won't go too far beyond noting that, apparently, Chris Hemsworth is the only male Wolverine who has been through puberty and growing facial hair.

The film's few positives are found when Jeffrey Dean Morgan and crew show up. But the amusing conflict of veteran combat marines being made to look silly by a bunch teenagers doesn't provide enough energy to recover from its creative death spiral.

Which of the two reboots hit an uglier target? I'll go with 'Tomorrow' as a larger fail. Reboot Red Dawn works better because of Hemsworth and Morgan; and because first-time director Dan Bradley's background as a stuntman made the final action sequences engaging.

Still, if you screen either production, prep yourself for dissatisfaction and disappointment.

Personal Notes:

- The one aspect I was looking forward to was the airborne assault. And again we see filmmakers with absolutely no experience improperly showcasing a tactic that could so easily been addressed with the assistance of a military advisor. Paratroopers without rucks, heavy equipment being dropped simultaneously with personnel, and an entire bleeping division jumping directly into a city as their drop zone. Which moron came up with that idea? If it's the listed veteran - Dotan Baer - then something got seriously lost in the translation or he flat out failed his job.

- I won't rip the producers for turning the enemy into North Koreans. The Chinese literally have our fiscal sacks in their grip. And you can't tick off your bankers because they can squeeze harder than you can poke.

- Connor Cruise, Tom's kid. No theatrical background, no formal training, but... not bad. Not great, but not bad. Interesting.",1360281600,8,5366,5.2438739789965

5395816,4,B00A7MSQRK,"Red Dawn (2012)

Red Dawn is story of a group of Spokane Washington Teenagers and a lone Iraq War veteran who fight back against an invasion of North Korean soldiers who've taken over the Pacific Northwest just as the Russians have taken over the Eastern Seaboard.

The story begins as a high school football game in Spokane, where the Wolverines lead by quarterback Matt Eckert (Josh Peck) lose a final seconds loss against cross-town rivals, the Titans. Matt doesn't know it but his brother Jed (Chris Hemsworth) is back from six years in the Marine Corps...including tours in Iraq. Before Matt and Jed can resume their fraternal relationship, Spokane loses all electricity. The power outage is merely a prelude to an invasion by North Korean military forces with Russian advisors.

Jed and Matt must flee into the woods, taking with them an assortment of Matt's classmates from school. When the scope of the invasion becomes clear, Jed decides to train the teenagers in military skills and tactics. They soon begin conducting guerilla assaults on the North Korean forces. During their reconnaissance of the North Koreans, they snap pictures of a secret enemy communications device. When they meet up with a team of Force Recon Marines, the professional soldiers and the teenage guerillas must find a way to steal the communications device. From that point on the action gets really intense.

A few years back, I read that Hollywood was planning a Red Dawn remake and the studio execs were demanding major changes to the script. The problem was that the intended invading enemy in the story was the People's Republic of China. The Execs were worried that making such a movie would anger the Chinese government, and make it impossible to distribute American movies in China. So the enemy was changed to North Korea to appease PRC censors. But North Korea is a dysfunctional country of malnourished slaves. Seriously, NK citizens are about 6 inches shorter than their South Korean cousins because communal food production has brought the country repeatedly to starvation.

So how could such a repressed, backward, dysfunctional country invade the United States? Well the opening sequence pretty well spells it out. In short, persistent recession and a weakened US military leave America vulnerable to attack. But don't worry, the American can-do spirit and the 2nd Amendment create a situation where the North Koreans find themselves with a mouthful too tough to chew.

While Red Dawn is mostly shoot-em-up fun, the premise the movie is built around should give us cause for reflection. NPR has reported that North Korean and Chinese (state sponsored) hackers are continuously probing America's weaknesses. They've hacked the power grid, the Department of Defense, the stock market, and multiple Defense Contractors. China has more people studying science and engineering than we have college students. Most of our undergraduates are majoring in useful stuff like film, sociology, women's studies, and anything else that doesn't require math. So how long before America's enemies have a high-tech super-weapon that can shut down our power-grid and disable our defenses? We may find out soon enough.",1357257600,2,3198,5.176015473887814

I just saw this movie today, and it is a wash compared to the original, I'm not jaded I'm just being honest.
The original had a riveting sound track that pumped you up and drew you into the movie, the characters had development and personality, you grew to care about them and they where fleshed out, the combat scenes where much more realistic too.

This movie felt like a made for tv flick, I felt detached from all the characters, they where monotone, boring and displayed poor acting.
The Marines where just terrible, they acted absolutely silly, in the original the solder they  meet is serious and acts as a real solder would, modest strong and knowledgable in a rough situation, I felt that the Marines in this movie defaced the Corps and sort of made me sick to watch, Marines are super disciplined and all that I have met where very down to earth smart men, these guys in the movie where a joke, it was like they took clones of duke Nukem and tossed them in with one liners to boot.
The music was bland, like stereotypical combat music, it just lacked any luster and made the already bad move just that much harder to watch.

How can people like this flick?
I don't know, but then again how could we let out own country go down hill as well, something to think about, standards are just down these days.

I feel like the original should have a re-release instead of a remake, introduce it to the younger generation instead of destroying the soul of an original story.

Why rewrite a masterpiece?
What would become of our culture if every awesome book written was erased every year and people just made the books erasing the old ones?
Then again no one reads these days ether, so there you have it.

See the original!
It's not a hipster or indie thing me saying this, it really is just infinitely superior.

Down rate as you like, peace out.",1356307200,4,1950,4.427374301675978
5395819,5,B00A7MSQRK,"I saw this in the theater twice and I LOVED it! I'm a huge Chris Hemsworth fan, and this film made me love him even more. I love Jed, his character. He became the leader/big brother/drill sargent/protector of this little band of wily heroes. It's one of those films that made me feel patriotic too. It's all about a small group defeating a large one through their team work and cleverness, which always makes me think of America. Chris was so charismatic and sweet and wonderful in his role. And for my fellow Supernatural peeps out there, Jeffrey Dean Morgan (John Winchester) and Adrienne Pailicki (Jessica) are both in it and have great roles! They did a wonderful job as well.  I will be buying this as soon as it comes out on dvd.",1356134400,2,735,4.485074626865671
5395820,1,B00A7MSQRK,"I was actually looking forward to this film because the concept seemed interesting at first. I have not seen the original movie so I don't know how this remake stacks up to it but this is honestly one of the most forgettable films I've seen all year. The premise itself about the Koreans invading the US wasn't executed well enough for me to even care about what was happening. Maybe if they had spent some time developing the characters and the situation before the spit hit the fan I would have actually given a crap. And As someone who used to watch Nickelodeon as a kid, I could not take Josh Peck seriously in a film like this. The the only person seemed like he was atleast trying to act was Chris Hemsworth. The other characters aren't even worth mentioning. If they all died by the end of the film I would not have shed a tear. I don't recommend this at all.",1355875200,7,866,4.319018404907975
5395821,2,B00A7MSQRK,"Virtually the exact same problems as the recent Aussie reboot, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tomorrow-When-The-War-Began/dp/B007CUQBAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tomorrow When The War Began</a>"".

I'm convinced now that no modern western filmmaker can ""do insurgent"" any more. There's just too much disconnect between the writers and directors of today because they've never known what it's like to be subjugated, threatened and terrified. We're never going to see the kinds of films like we did after WW2, when so many creators literally lived through the various horrors of war, including being conquered by an invading enemy.

Read a story once told by a comic book artist. When he was a young man and first tried his hand at illustration, all he had were comic books to teach him. It took many months of hard work, but he finally completed his first project. Impressed and praising himself for the effort and energy he had put into it, he took the art to the publishers thinking he would be hired on the spot. He wasn't.

In fact, he was quickly and repeatedly dismissed. Confused, frustrated, and hurt, he finally asked one of the editors 'why' no one was interested. The editor, seeing that the young artist was suffering, took time out of his busy schedule, sat him down and explained that his work was junk. Why? Because he hadn't studied and learned from real life. A comic book is already a highly interpretive form of art, and when you copy and learn from a skewed version of reality, in turn, your version is utterly bleeped. He told him to take proper art classes, learning to draw from life and studying under qualified teachers, so that only when he was truly ready, he should try again.

Readily applicable advice to filmmakers.

Writers/directors need to experience the event, live the life, do the deed before putting their concepts into scripts. At the very least, do an intense exploration of the topic they're going to film. Otherwise, it's not a depiction of reality but a distorted caricature. For example: In the scene when the young would-be insurgents throw away food. Talk to survivors of invasions and they'll either laugh in your face or knock you upside your head for suggesting throwing away anything, much less food. During the Siege Of Leningrad - the populace ended up eating their cats and dogs - before turning to cannibalism.

Disconnected = Falsity.

This reboot is reflective of so many films today: Superficial, underdeveloped and plastic. In this case, one doesn't really believe they're a bunch of kids who have suffered under the brutal thumb of oppression, much less worked their way to becoming unconventional combatants.

I hesitated on this next part because I'm essentially committing plagiarism. To be fair, I'm plagiarizing myself. But I don't see the point of duplicating work already completed. So, from my review of ""Tomorrow When The War Began"" --- Why does everyone's makeup look so even throughout the movie? One of the reasons the original 'Red Dawn' worked was you could see how plain everyone was being virtually makeup free. And, most importantly, looked progressively worse as the film went on - which of course makes complete sense. I'm thinking specifically of Lea Thompson and Jennifer Grey who were almost unrecognizable by the movie's final. That all the females had their hair and makeup intact throughout the flick doomed this to Hollywood ridiculousness.

And I won't go too far beyond noting that, apparently, Chris Hemsworth is the only male Wolverine who has been through puberty and growing facial hair.

The film's few positives are found when Jeffrey Dean Morgan and crew show up. But the amusing conflict of veteran combat marines being made to look silly by a bunch teenagers doesn't provide enough energy to recover from its creative death spiral.

Which of the two reboots hit an uglier target? I'll go with 'Tomorrow' as a larger fail. Reboot Red Dawn works better because of Hemsworth and Morgan; and because first-time director Dan Bradley's background as a stuntman made the final action sequences engaging.

Still, if you screen either production, prep yourself for dissatisfaction and disappointment.

Personal Notes:

- The one aspect I was looking forward to was the airborne assault. And again we see filmmakers with absolutely no experience improperly showcasing a tactic that could so easily been addressed with the assistance of a military advisor. Paratroopers without rucks, heavy equipment being dropped simultaneously with personnel, and an entire bleeping division jumping directly into a city as their drop zone. Which moron came up with that idea? If it's the listed veteran - Dotan Baer - then something got seriously lost in the translation or he flat out failed his job.

- I won't rip the producers for turning the enemy into North Koreans. The Chinese literally have our fiscal sacks in their grip. And you can't tick off your bankers because they can squeeze harder than you can poke.

- Connor Cruise, Tom's kid. No theatrical background, no formal training, but... not bad. Not great, but not bad. Interesting.",1355702400,2,5366,5.2438739789965
5395822,1,B00A7MSQRK,"Ahoy, spoilers ahead!

Jed, veteran Marine, is home in Spokane, Washington when the North Koreans invade the United States.  Instead of capitulating to the Koreans' dictatorship, he trains a group of high schoolers to use guns and then turns them loose on the Koreans. Wow, dude.  Pretty intrepid-sounding.  What a foolish movie!  However, I'll be charitable and list the good and the bad.

Good things:

1.  Chris Hemsworth.  This was his first movie, I suppose, so he wasn't stellar, but he acted his part admirably.  I really liked his work in the Marvel franchise and in Snow White and the Huntsman.  He didn't do a great job in this film, but again - it was tolerable.  That said, he's too friendly to play a tough-guy role; it seemed like he couldn't convince himself when he was being firm with his bonehead brother or when he swore (the swearing sounded silly coming from him).

2.  The line about the **** sandwich without bread, the deer blood joke and the guns.

Now, the bad:

1.  Josh Peck.  From under what rock did he come blinking out from?  I've never heard of him and he's a terrible, terrible actor.  I used to think Channing Tatum was awful, but now I'm starting to think that he's pretty good when compared with Peck, who has no facial expressions other than half-asleep and slightly stoned.  He needs to find another career.

2.  The entire supporting cast.  They were all blah actors.  I couldn't empathize with any of them and they irritated me.

3.  Boring dialogue, boring explosions, boring chases, and boring gunfights.  Thirty minutes into the movie, I was getting fidgety and I couldn't wait for it to end.  How about some creativity, dudes?

4.  The ending!  Jed gets up to claim his beer from Toni and just like that he is shot to death.  Really?  My thanks to the filmmakers for insulting me with an hour and a half of stupidity and then killing off the only semi-likable character in their dump of a movie.

5.  The North Koreans and the completely implausible plot.  If there were such things as .5-dimensional characters, the antagonists in this movie would certainly be just that.  They were hardly evil.  And...dude.  Wassup with the plot?  Where was the U.S. Army?  I saw one F-16 fighter...that's it.  There were far too many plot holes to list here, but the complete absence of the U.S. military was just too ridiculous to swallow.

6.  Cliches.  They were everywhere!  In the dialogue, in the action sequences, in the interaction between characters - no scene was without them.  I don't mind a few, but by the end of the movie they were killing me!

That's about it.  If you like shoot-'em-up movies, then perhaps you might appreciate Red Dawn.  But I just don't think it's worth the price of a theater ticket or of a DVD.  Don't watch it; it's boring, insulting, run-of-the-mill pap!",1355443200,3,2826,4.663265306122449
5395823,1,B00A7MSQRK,"Remakes of ""cult classic"" type movies are rarely worthy of the original, so Red Dawn  2012 was suspect from the get go. When word got out that the enemy invading force was changed post production, to N Korean, to appease the chinese  market, I knew it couldn't be good. It was therefor, no suprise to me that Red Dawn 2012 pales in comparison to the original on virtually every level.
  Despite a few plot holes, the original Red Dawn was a pretty good movie, and to some extent at least plausable, It had Characters you could identify with, moral quandries, some nods to the second ammendment, a sense of patriotism, and well filmed sweeping big battle scenes. Red Dawn 2012 had none of these factors, its sole nod to patriotism amountted to 'we were born here its our country', nothing more.
  The plot for RD 2012 is full of holes so big you could drive an ICBM through them, aside from the most obvious; North Koreans that can't even feed themselves invading a much larger nation half a world away, you have a group of teen rebels (terrorists in the eyes of the North Korean occupiers) driving back and forth between the occupied city of Spokane and their hideaway in the mountains. Apparently the North Koreans brought plenty of gasoline with them because the Wolverines didn't seem to be bothered with the fact that their truck might run out of fuel. Nor did all those pesky military checkpoints seem to slow them down. One has to presume that after the kids blow one of them up the North Koreans just dismantled all of them so as not to impede their travel.
  Then there's the Subway, While escaping from a band of North Korean soldiers the teens stumble into a crowded subway, fully stocked with lunch meats and all the trimmings, and of course soda!  (Finally an answer as to why the North Koreans invaded, they wanted our sandwiches!!)  So anyway, since they had so much time on their hands before the pursuing soldiers catch up with them, they decide to rob the Subway of all the food and a bucket of soda. Then they jump in their vehicles and return to the mountains, no doubt stopping for gas, and perhaps a bathroom break along the way.  The next scene pretty much sums up the entire movie, while wolfing down their bounty from subway the teens discuss the things they miss from their prewar days.
  ""I miss Call of duty"" one of them chirps.
  ""Dude were living Call Of Duty and its hell"" replies another.
Hell indeed, this movie is about as much fun as wacthing your 10 year old nephew play call of duty for and hour and a half.",1354838400,45,2543,4.497826086956522
5395824,3,B00A7MSQRK,"I think this movie's script fell apart and was kind of thrown together late.  I wondered if they would release it or not?  maybe one of those things with the Chris Hemsworth getting hot on the movie scene and Josh Hutcherson coming off the popular Hunger Games I think they made the move to release it, better now then never!!!

The movie starts out great and is pretty good until about half way in then kind of looses it's appeal so to speak.  The ending makes it so they can make a part 2 but with how this one again had a so so script it's hard to say if they'll risk a part 2 or not?

I would give it a 3.5 stars out of 5, but not sure if I will buy it or not? buying a dvd means enjoying it over and over and not sure if this one would fit that description unless I get it very cheap.

I would say it's worth a watch if you are the type that likes these kind of movies but not expect too much, the original had a much better impact on it's viewers then this one did...

I own the orginal... not sure if I'll own this one on dvd.",1354838400,,1033,3.8443396226415096
5395825,2,B00A7MSQRK,"The original film was the darling of second amendment advocates. Without a well armed civilian population, the Red Army would march in and take over. While as improbable the original script or corny the lines, there was a group of young up and coming actors that were able to deliver those lines and make us feel them.

In this film....the North Koreans? The same North Koreans who couldn't conquer South Korea and it was a small country right next door to them? These guys couldn't find their own butt with both hands and a map, but have been able to conquer a nation with a huge land mass and a modern military, with allies that would actually fight for us. So the scenario has gone from very improbable, to seriously? The same guys who shot missiles in spirals? We could conquer N. Korea after breakfast and be home for lunch.

At this point I had to remove my brain from my head to watch the film.

This film was updated to reflect the changes in the audience which demands more action and special effects at the cost of silly things like creating characters or drama.

Armed with some C-4 that happened to be lying around, Jed (Chris Hemsworth) leads a group of teens against the Red Army because somehow our entire arm forces stationed in over 100 nations and all the ships at sea are too busy fighting some electronic jamming EMF thing. In one scene Robert (Josh Hutcherson) risks everyone's life to rescue the pretty blond Erica (Isabel Lucas) and still can't score.

With an inane script, you need good actors who can bring it to life. This one didn't have it. In fact it bordered on campy considering it was NORTH KOREA! The film ended rather abruptly after a brief ""patriotic"" message...""This is our home."" Older generations who saw the original, might want to catch this later as a cheap rental...or not. Not as good as Expendables 2. This is a good film to pretend you want to see really bad, but your girlfriend doesn't want to see it. You then make the ""big sacrifice"" and watch ""Twilight"" with her which should lead to....

Parental Guide: 1 F-bomb, no sex or nudity. The city is suppose to be Spokane, but it was filmed mostly in Michigan. The army was originally Chinese, but it was changed so not to insult the Chinese. Now the film could be shown in their market. How comes I feel like we already lost without firing a shot?

5395826,5,B00A7MSQRK,"Having seen the first Red Dawn and now the second I enjoyed both films. I couldn't imagine the North Koreans being able to invade the United States. In the original movie the invading forces were the Russians and the Cubans. The hero in this movie is a Marine who is fixing to be shipped to Iraq. One morning
they awaken to invading North Koreans parachuting out of the sky. The Marine and some of his associates escape to a cabin just outside of town(Spokane).They
are betrayed by one of their group(they do pay him back).The battle begins. They adopt the name Wolverines after their football team. They begin stealing weapons and launch an impressive geurilla war. The North Koreans never know where the Wolverines are going to pop up. They provide plenty of strife and stress for the North Koreans(the Russians finally appear). The Wolverines manage to steal a communications used by the North Koreans. The Wolverines get
stronger and more organized. This makes for a very good movie. Be sure to see this.",1354406400,14,1008,4.7988505747126435
5395827,5,B00A7MSQRK,"I was a huge fan of the original Red Dawn, but I have also been excited since I heard about this project in 2009. I love that, like the original, it took a bunch of relatively unknown actors to make a fantastic cast. Although, I don't know that this movie would have reached the same audience had it been immediately distributed in 2010. Chris Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson were little known names three years ago. Today they're the stars of two of the biggest releases EVER. That alone helps add to the acting pedigree of the film.

I love the updated plot line. Yes, the central theme is still wonderfully in tact, but the storyline also evolved to take into account the state of affairs in the world today. A communist threat doesn't hold the same weight now that it did in the 80s.

This is a great remake for fans of the original. And for people, especially the younger generation, that wouldn't necessarily understand why Russia was such a big deal decades ago, will be able to see the relevance in this film. I think it will effortlessly attract old fans and new fans. Definitely check this one out!",1353974400,2,1106,4.525

The enemy is different now (Korea vs. U.S), but the action was still good, and the acting was A LOT better than expected with Chris Hemsworth taking the lead. The cast did interest me a lot in seeing including Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Adrianne Palicki.

For me the original was an enjoyable piece from 80s, so the remake could have easily just copied it and could have been a waste, but I am glad they changed a couple of things like state, some character changes (including their deaths). A lot of memorable scenes and quotes probably my favorite was the ""you *beep* with the wrong family line"" (which really got the audience roaring).

I didn't feel it was a cohesive as the original, but it wasn't entirely falling apart, either.  One problem I had was that the North Korean invaders were vicious, as they would be expected to be, but not very aggressive in their pursuit of the rebels.  One scene had them hiding out in a forest ditch while the NOKO captain and a few soldiers stood nearby with a bullhorn having the rebel family members talk to them with the bullhorn.
