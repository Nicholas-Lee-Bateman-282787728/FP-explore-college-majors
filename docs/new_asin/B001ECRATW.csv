8297717,3,B001ECRATW,"The Crunch one is fantastic! I have had it for six or seven years, and I bought this bundle to give that one to my mom. It is intermediate in level, and it's a workout that I could do (and have done!) again and again.

I felt like the Pick Your Level regurgitates a lot of the Crunch one, so I liked it but didn't feel like it offered much new. The 10-minute one didn't do much for me in 10-minute increments, and it didn't have a great flow when using several 10-minute workouts together.

And the Pilates for Dummies was too slow to keep me interested. The Amazon description for that one says that the instructor ""patiently presents"" each workout. Substitute ""boring"" for ""patient,"" and then the description is pretty accurate.

I think the set might be worth it, depending on the price. If you can only get one, though, go with the Crunch one!",1279238400,4,847,4.416666666666667
8297718,5,B001ECRATW,I haven't gotten around to even opening the other 3 DVDs. I was in love with the 10-minute workout the second I popped it into the player. Its perfect for anyone who doesn't have an hour to spend in front of a TV. You can select the area you want to work on and even create your own custom work out sessions. each mini session is 10 minutes long which is perfect for me after a busy day at work. The exercises are excellent in terms of complexity for novices and are easy to follow even from the start.,1267920000,,502,4.08080808080808
8297719,4,B001ECRATW,"It's a very useful set of pilates DVDs. I have never practiced pilates before and these DVDs give me all I need to know about pilates. They are for beginners (dummies), intermediate (crunch, pick your level), and advance (10 mins solution). I like Crunch dvd the most and find 10 mins solution a little bit too fast. Overall, it's a good deal set of pilates DVDs.",1267574400,,363,4.515151515151516
8297720,5,B001ECRATW,"I thought that 4 pilates dvds would become repetative, but they are all very different in terms of style.  I love having a choice and being able to switch up the intenisty/movement while staying with pilates is great.  I already feel and see a difference in my body.  I highly recommend this set!",1264982400,,296,4.547169811320755
8297721,5,B001ECRATW,"I love these DVD's, so  much variety to keep me motivated.  A great combination.  Shipping was fast and everything was packed perfectly.",1224806400,9,136,5.090909090909091
