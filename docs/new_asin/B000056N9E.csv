7932236,5,B000056N9E,"I was amazed to read they were putting out the ""Val Carney"" episode on DVD because it is notorious for the hilarious on-camera break-ups. (And it wasen't even shown live by then!)  One classic moment is when Buffalo Bob grabs Clarabell's contract and tears it in two by mistake-he breaks down laughing and only gets through it all by pretending to cry.  At times you can hear the crew in hysterics off camera. Grab this one by all means!",984787200,8,437,4.518987341772152
