4470007,2,B004UQLVQM,"I have to say, the real reason I ever even was willing to try this movie was that I love Kareena and Shahid's movies. I watched this one on Netflix, and was not that impressed. It wasn't the actors themselves, it was just downright terrible direction, and a story line which left something to be desired. You could tell that the actors were tying to make a terrible plot work, but failed miserably. Within the first 15 minutes I was ready to turn it off and go with a different movie completely.

The story seems to go in every direction but one that makes any kind of sense. The basic premise starts off okay; young man from a good but working middle class family in a small town, gets into trouble when he tries all different get rich quick ventures, and loses his own, and everyone else's money he's borrowed from in the town. As the viewer I had to ask myself ""why doesn't he just get a regular job, and pay off his debt?""
But I guess he is so far emerged in debt and disgraced his family so much, he figures the only way out, is to kill himself to get his family the life insurance money, and that way his Dad can pay off his debts once he's dead. (It also conveniently gets him out of a marriage to a girl who is nice enough, but a bit clingy, and not really right for him.) Sure, right, okay that would be my first course of action, to throw myself into the sea with all my creditors looking on, -your's too, right???....

Anyhow, after he throws himself dramatically into the sea-off a pier, you wonder as the viewer ""okay...? What now?""
After that the writers themselves were unsure what to do it seems. He meets up with a couple of stupid but well meaning fishermen, who take him in, and believe him to be a mute (as he refuses to speak to even tell them truthfully who he is, and why he was in the ocean). From there a whole huge comedy of errors erupts, and carries on for an inordinately long and unnecessary amount of time, until you as the viewer are ready to just give up on the story all together, you almost don't even care about Shahid's charecter anymore it's so painful. Some might think it funny. I had a really hard time laughing through most of it.

It doesn't start to get really good until Shahid's Character meets up with Kareena's and that doesn't happen until half way through the movie. Most of it I simply fast forwarded through, as it was so silly it was painful to sit through. Most of the acting is ridiculous, and over the top. I also had a hard time understanding the motivation of Shahid's character in why he stays with the two fisherman who find him, and why he chooses not to talk through almost the entire movie. It gets really good only at the very end, when he has to chose between the girl he really loves, and the girl he has a prior obligation to. Only at the very end do the writers pull through with an interesting plot. And also from there the lead characters performances really shine. Interestingly enough, it's also when the movie shifts from being a silly comedy, to serious romance story. If they had simply gone with that plot through the entire movie, it would have been loads better. I can see how maybe they were trying to go for a comedy of errors type of story, but it just doesn't work for me at all. And if you out check all the other reviews on Netflix, most everyone else shares my sentiments too. In the end, if you skip this one of Shahid and Kareena's, you're not missing much.",1335916800,,3444,4.295384615384616
4470008,4,B004UQLVQM,"With this movie, I ended up enjoying it mostly for the actors themselves (the story is silly for the initial 2/3).  The songs/music are good too.

If you are a  Kareena Kapoor  or  Shahid Kapoor fan, then this is a worthwhile movie to watch (I've seen it twice).
It isn't up to the same level as ""Jab We Met"", and it can be frustrating/tedious sometimes, but for a silly movie it was usually enjoyable.

The following is a compliment:  since Kareena's character ""Shruti"" is mute it forces Kareena as an actress to rely solely on her body language and eye contact, which I really liked (she is beautiful in this movie).  She never speaks in the entire movie, except she does 'sing' once during a dance scene (a daydream/fantasy moment - not a real event in the story).  I think she did a great job for this part, intentionally low-key (she drew me into the movie whenever she was on screen).

The UTV version of the DVD is a high quality disc (dual layer, anamorphic, Dolby Digital 5.1, with an 8 page 'booklet' built-in, great menus that were creatively designed), the cinematography is well done, a couple dances & music are good, and the cast are great.

I'm giving this movie 4 stars, for the fun of watching the cast.",1327708800,,1221,4.504545454545455
4470009,5,B004UQLVQM,"Very funny movie! Loved it. The music was just as great. It is fun, very entertaining, and a perfect film for families. I do reccommend this film to everyone. The soundtrack is a must as well.",1324857600,,192,4.361111111111111
4470010,4,B004UQLVQM,"The first half was so funny that I had a sore stomach and there wasn't a single scene were I didn't laugh. The film shows the problems of people who are in dept it is a serious matter but was shown with extreme humour. Paresh Rawal & Rajpal Yadav were the best, the movie would be completely nothing without them because both of them are terrific comic actors. In the first appearance of Paresh he tried to hide himself from someone because he took a loan from him and he was putting his face on the ground just like an ostrich hiding it's head in a hole that is why the film is called Chup Chup Ke because everyone is hiding from someone else. Cinematography was excellent and everyone was wearing white clothing I don't know why probably to highlight everyone but it did look good on them. The second half was really emotional and I felt really sorry for both girls who wanted to marry Shahid Kapoor and the ending was good because everyone were fair to each other. The movie was directed by Priyadarshan who is the best comedy director after David Dhawan and Chup Chup Ke is his best film as far as I've seen them. Songs are amazing made by one of my favourite music composers Himesh Reshammiya the best songs are Shabe Firaq and Dil Vich Lagya.",1304380800,3,1248,4.383620689655173

8441985,5,B004UQLVQM,I REALLY LOVED THIS FILM AND ENJOYED IT TOO.  NO COMPLAINTS HERE.  I PURCHASED THE DIGITAL MOVIE AND ORDERED THE DVD MOVIE.  WILL WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE TO COME OUT ON A BLU RAY WHEN IT BECOMES AVAILABLE. PLEASE POST IT OUT SO I CAN PURCHASE ONE.  THE DVD IS OKAY BUT EVENTUALLY IT GETS WORN OUT.  THANK YOU FOR MAKING IT AVAILABLE AS A DIGITAL.,1442188800,,342,4.121212121212121
8441986,2,B004UQLVQM,"Good things about this film: colorful costumes, beautiful people, and nice scenery. I love Kareena and Shahid  together, but was very disappointed with the plot  of this story. I was also surprised to see Apner Kher playing such a part. There were too many good character actors and leading actors in the movie for it to be as awful as it was. I don't see that as their fault, but rather as the fault of the screen writers.",1427414400,,423,4.410256410256411
8441987,2,B004UQLVQM,I love Bollywood - I consider myself a fanatic and know everything about it. I had high spectations about this movie but it was just another Hindi bad story drama. Im so happy that now a days things are changing for the Hindi Cinema!,1405468800,,233,4.318181818181818
8441988,5,B004UQLVQM,"I love this movie. I've seen it before, but if anyone is curious, it's about a guy pretending to be deaf in order to avoid paying off a bunch of debts. Very funny, as he begins to fall in love with a deaf woman. The only downside was the one scene where randomly they're both singing...and made no sense plot wise to do so. Still a great movie to watch, if you like Bollywood films, this is one you should try!",1376697600,2,410,4.074074074074074
8441989,5,B004UQLVQM,"This is a Bollywood movie, with great music and a great story. What's really nice is in this movie, Kareena Kapoor is silent. :-) She's not our favorite Indian Cinema actress, but Shahid Kapoor is definitely a favorite in this family with 3 young girls. The story gets a little goofy, but it definitely is worth seeing. We have watched this movie multiple times in our efforts to learn Hindi as a family and we quote from it often. Love it!",1366588800,,440,4.444444444444445
