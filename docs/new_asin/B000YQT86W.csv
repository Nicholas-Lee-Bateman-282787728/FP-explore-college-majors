8233885,5,B000YQT86W,"I've watched this video several times and at first it didn't seem like anything was happening. Suddenly about 2 weeks ago, I started having really vivid dreams. Then it all started to change for me. My level of attracting things really started to shift. I started to get a huge influx of contact requests on LinkedIn as well as Recruiters contacting me with potential job offers. (I hadn't even submitted my Resume to any of them.) Total strangers are beginning to ask my opinion about everything from fashion choices to what type of music I enjoy. (I won't mention the invitation for coffee...) I've also gotten the opportunity (this week) to develop a training program for one of my clients. (Currently one of the top 5 Automobile Manufacturers in the US.) I'm going to continue to watch it every night before I go to bed and can't wait to see what happens. Thanks for this video!",1365984000,2,882,4.660256410256411
8233886,3,B000YQT86W,"This is something that you have to use over time to get/see results. I'm still evaluating it; the format is interesting and they did a good job in getting a format that someone could use and not get totally bored with it. I don't know if this matters, but I noticed that some of the ""subliminals"" were actually ""flashed"" fast enough in the video and I could ""see"" the words. I don't think you can classify that as being ""subliminal"". The same is true for the audio. My perception was that ""subliminal"" meant something that would be undetectable to your conscious mind. If that's true, then this DVD doesn't pass that test. Congruently, if that's true then this DVD would not work. Be that as it may, I'm still using the DVD and it's been about a month. Nothing yet. It may have been a waste of money, or used as an ""up sell"" to get you to buy other products from Dr. Vitale. I just don't know.",1280620800,,893,4.321428571428571
8233887,2,B000YQT86W,"The ideas behind this DVD are great.  I purchased it at a price higher than its competitors because I like some of the techniques described.  I also purchased it with the intention of watching it every day for 6 weeks to test the benefits.  Like another reviewer, I couldn't get past day 3.  Possibly they should include a bottle of Pepto Bismol with the DVD :-)

Things I don't like:
1. REPETITIVE STORIES:  Stories are fine. . . . .the first 1 or 2 times, but in order to get the benefit of the subliminals, you are forced to to listen to the same boring stories over and over, about how much Joe likes himself, about Joe's cars and his $5,000.00 lighter, not to mention the marketing of his other products . . . . GAG . . . . . once was plenty for me!  A suggestion would be to put the stories on a separate track (or in a book) so they could be bypassed for subsequent listenings.

2. NEGATIVE PROGRAMMING:  In one segment Mark Ryan talks about all of the things that you don't want in your life.  Anyone who has
used affirmations knows this is a big no no.

3. SMOKING AS A GOOD THING:  In another segment, Mark Ryan talks about how he overcame his aversion to smoking cigars as a POSITIVE thing(?).  At the end of the segment, he then has to put a disclaimer explaining to people that he is not condoning smoking.  I think he could have come up with a better example, considering the fact that that there may be potential customers who are trying to overcome an addiction to smoking.  As an ex-smoker myself, I don't even feel comfortable watching the segment.

4. RETURN:  The company that sells it is a different name, so returns may be difficult, although I am not going to bother.

5. VISUALLY BORING:  I rapidly tired of watching Joe play with his lighter, driving in his car, and watching people smoke cigars.

Things I like:
  They used several different techniques including subliminals - visual and audio, and Ho'oponopno, and some hypnosis.  They did
  have one segment that that had some nice photograpy, but it happened to be the segment where you are supposed to close your
  eyes.

This could have been a great DVD which is what is so disappointing.
GOOD IDEAS - BAD PRESENTATION - BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD FELLAS - BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME!

I may still use it on a very rare occasion, but if you are looking for something you can use daily, I suggest the Kelly Howell CD for attracting wealth.  I am self-employed and over the past year, work has been near non-existent.  In 2 weeks of listening To Kelly's CD every day, I have had 2 jobs come in, a deposit on a pending job, and another job added more work.  I don't know if it is the CD or not, but the other benefit is that it has also affected other areas in my life including self-esteem.  My posture has improved and I smile a lot, in spite of going through some very difficult times.  When I play it at night, I wake up in a great mood. The only thing that is different in my life has been the CD.  And it was only $10.17 + shipping, (compared to $79.00 + shipping for Joe's DVD).  The best money I ever spent.  I ordered 3 more.",1251676800,11,3106,4.293103448275862
8233888,2,B000YQT86W,"I like Joe Vitale and think he does care about others (I do not know who Mark Ryan is), but this DVD was incredibly boring and after viewing it 3-4 times we could not watch in anymore.  I do not know if subliminals work or not but for us it was a ""not"".",1222646400,10,253,3.7735849056603774
