7935825,3,B00005AUE0,"Fans of the original series will miss the fire and passion of Sigrid Thornton in the role of Philadelphia. Nikki Coghill's portrayal is softer and less feisty, which I found disappointing. In many ways the production did succeed in carrying over the feel, look and sound of the original series, including the same musical themes. The drama in the second half was less contrived, with a little better character development, although I found the ending weaker and less satisfying than the original. I will admit that I have watched the original series many times and as often happens, sequels have trouble living up to our desire for the stories we love to carry on seamlessly. Without that strong attachment and bias, newcomers to the series may find it more enjoyable than I did.",1046908800,10,779,4.864661654135339
