8204629,1,B000S77742,"This movie was just awful. I guess I thought that it would be geared toward children from the cover art and due to the fact that at least one of the actors was a Disney regular. My major issue: One of the characters comes out and says that everyone knows that parents buy Christmas presents, and not Santa....great - as I watched with my 7 year old. So I had to explain that one. The explanation to that statement in the movie was basically that yes, this is true but Santa brings you your one special gift. Just warning you in advance as I wished someone had warned me. I could literally see my daughter's face drop after she heard that since she still believes that Santa brings all her presents. Way to destroy the magic. It was also so tedious and boring that my 7 year old asked part way through if she could turn it off and go to bed - before her bedtime! There are lots of great holiday movies out there, but in my opinion, this has to be one of the very worst.",1387065600,,968,4.154255319148936
8204630,3,B000S77742,This movie is a funny joke of a movie.  It is a spoof on Christmas and some of the funny things that go into it.  This is more of an adult film than one for chidren.,1360627200,,165,3.5555555555555554
8204631,5,B000S77742,"Not sure why this movie is not more popular, at least in a cult/niche movie sort of way. I did not expect much and only threw it in to kill some time but I enjoyed it so much I watched it again within a week. The voice actors are good and the humor is way different than what you get from most seasonal offerings. Even the product placement seems to be done in a ""in your face"" sort of way to make it humorous. The animation is also just a little bit different from your typical that it keeps you entertained on its own.",1350345600,2,520,4.009615384615385
8204632,1,B000S77742,"I bought this for my 6 yr old and 4 yr old. It is slow moving, depressing and all around BORING. They sat through 15 minutes and asked to turn it off.
Worst of all, this has obvious adult humor. Luckily, my kids didn't pick up on it. DO NOT buy this for children.",1292371200,5,263,3.888888888888889
8204633,4,B000S77742,"The movie has many funny lines, I love the idea of including the symbols of other holidays and making them into main characters, not a lot of songs, I like that, is a very good movie to watch, not the best, but is worth watching and adding to a collection.",1291507200,,256,4.14
8204634,2,B000S77742,"This is a rather mindless story, but the visuals are awfully cute.
The figures  themselves bring smiles to adult faces. Great for children 0 to 4",1261785600,,145,4.576923076923077
8204635,3,B000S77742,"I guess I had too high expectations for this movie so felt a little let down after/while watching it.  I remember thinking to myself ""it's going to get better"" but sadly it never did.  Maybe because I was comparing it to the greats of a similar nature such as Rudolph, Frosty, and The Year Without a Santa Claus.  I'm sure young kids will still like it, but just don't expect too much if you are an adult and rememeber some of the films i just mentioned. animation is nice.",1254441600,2,473,4.292134831460674
8204636,5,B000S77742,"This Christmas movie is so funny. My girlfriend bought a copy at Walmart and we've watched it no less than 5 times. This movie is meant for children and adults. I love the humor in this movie. It also has a nice story about a reindeer trying to find his place in Christmas. This movie has voice-overs by a lot of famous actors. Buy it, you and your family will enjoy watching it over and over. It's an instant classic!",1230595200,5,418,4.2375
