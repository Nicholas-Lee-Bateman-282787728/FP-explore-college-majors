4125790,5,B003HI3B80,"The Talking Words Factory is one of my children's favorites.  The Letter Factory video helped my boys learn their letters, and we are hoping this helps make progress on learning to read for our struggling reader.  So far, it seems it has.",1422403200,,238,4.642857142857143

4125792,3,B003HI3B80,"Not as fun as the Letter Factory. My 4 yrs old seems a little bored when watching it. I watch it for her and try to make it fun, but halfway she seems to be done. I like how they show that putting the letter sounds together make a word, but it's taking her long to understand the concept. Still I would recommend it.",1420848000,,316,3.953125

4125800,5,B003HI3B80,"We love all the Leap Frog offerings. These are a little old for my 2year old, but he watches them just the same. My 4year old can write her letters and is picking up how to spell words, and memorizing the songs from the school video.
Rainy day entertainment & learning.",1403222400,,269,4.294117647058823

4125803,5,B003HI3B80,Love any leap frog movie...  My 3 yr old know all his letters and sounds thanks to talking words factory!!  Best buy ever!,1379894400,,122,4.260869565217392
4125804,5,B003HI3B80,"My son has been a movie buff since he was 2. When other kids would only sit for 15 minutes at a time, he was going to the theater and sitting through full length films. He loves the leap frog movies and he basically learned all his letters in sounds after watching the Letter Factory 5 times (when hours upon hours of flash cards had failed). This set was a great primer for kindergarten and the Lets Go to School movie was his favorite on the weeks leading up to kindergarten.",1378771200,,477,4.252747252747253
4125805,3,B003HI3B80,"my kids love these tapes.  I'd start with the basic tapes first though like The letter factory and then buy this one as an ""extra""",1374192000,,130,4.2
4125816,3,B003HI3B80,"I was looking for a dvd to prepare my daughter for school and found this one. She really enjoys the word factory story but the school one - not so much. I think the school story is a bit buiser and not as identifiable for the children. It shows the classroom items (globe, clock, books, etc) just as eager for the first day of school and how they prepare for it. I'm still on the hunt for the right school dvd. The word factory is very good and helps the children with word pronunciation.",1372291200,,488,4.202127659574468
4125817,5,B003HI3B80,"My 3 yr old twins love these videos.  I'm not a fan of the rock-and-roll music they set to a lot of the songs in the ""Let's Go to School"" video, but besides that these are great videos and hold my child's attention just as much as Dora or Sofia the First.  :o)

Specifics:

""Let's Go To School""---learns about animal families and their names, counting, alphabet and sounds, telling time, recess, what to expect on your first day of school---probably would be good for a child who is nervous about going to school.  That is the setting for this DVD---the classroom toys are nervous and excited about school starting again.

""Talking Words Factory""--Cute and good for helping a child make the connection of how letters form words!",1366329600,,728,4.692913385826771
4125818,5,B003HI3B80,"I've always loved Leap Frog products because of their educational value.  Like the others, this one did not disappoint.  My 21-month-old learned her shapes from ""Shapeville Park"", her alphabet and the sounds they make from ""Letter Factory"" and now knows her days of the week and months of the year as well as how to count to 20 because of the ""Let's Go to School"" DVD.  I watch it along with her and we've both committed the songs to memory.  The video is fun as well as educational. Highly recommend to anyone with young ones.  As for the ""Talking Words,"" she is not interested at all.  She may just be too young though, so we will probably introduce this one too her later.",1366070400,3,675,4.4471544715447155

4125820,4,B003HI3B80,Bought these for my 3yr old son and he loves Let's Go to School. They are enjoyable to watch with him unlike some of the other kids videos/shows out. So thanks Leapfrog!,1361836800,,169,4.3125
4125821,5,B003HI3B80,I am a kindergarten teacher and LOVE the Leapfrog videos! They are all very educational and perfect for kindergarten (with the exception of the younger version with the dogs instead of frogs!).,1358640000,,193,5.0625

4125823,5,B003HI3B80,"My two children have autism and learn so well from watching videos. They picked up all their letter and letter sounds from the talking letters factory so I bought this one to move on to words.  They both immediately showed interest in having me write out words.  They are 4 and 2, definitely not reading yet but I can see this video to hold its value for the future also. They never get tired of watching it!",1354579200,,408,4.285714285714286

4125848,5,B003HI3B80,"I just recently started buying Leapfrog DVDs for my 3 year old.  He loves this one!  Well he actually loves all of them but with this one you get 2!.  I've not ever had a two sided DVD but that is what this is.  There is one ""movie"" one each side and it is labeled too.  This DVD is fun and educational at the same time.  Your child won't even realize they are learning.  It's also a great way to get a few moments to catch up on some work around the house but (wink wink) you didn't hear that from me!",1322352000,,502,3.8627450980392157

4125853,5,B003HI3B80,We got this DVD for our 4 year old son who was having trouble learning letter recoginition at preschool.  He has watched these movies over and over and over again.  Within two months of having this movie he has mastered every letter along with its associated sound.  The characters are great and keep him interested.  Our 18 month old loves to watch it as well and I can only hope he'll pick up some valuable education while watching it too.,1297382400,3,441,4.475
4125854,5,B003HI3B80,"These are great DVDs. Easy for kids to understand and follow along. My son has seen increases in his reading after watching these. Not a substitute for spending time with your kids, but useful in keeping them distracted and out of trouble. I try to leave these on while I'm in the next room so I can listen along and familiarize myself with the dialogue and story lines so when I hear it later I know what he's talking about.

8397114,4,B003HI3B80,"My 2 year old loves these movies. As a reading teacher, I am very picky about the movies he watches that promote phonics. Too many times, the sounds are pronounced with the schwa sound at the end, i. e. ""tu"" instead of ""t"". The Leap Frog videos are spot on with sounds and blending! Only issue I had was that you have to get up and physically turn the DVD over for each movie.",1466467200,,376,4.094594594594595
