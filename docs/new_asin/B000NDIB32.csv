2765812,2,B000NDIB32,Nice vidoe but....Does it really tell us the truth about Masons .I think No. It's just gives us history of freemasons and that's all. Come'on Freemasons filming about freemasons will they give all the secrets no it's just cover up. This Item is good for people who are interested in mainstream Mason history not the actual one anyway the choice is yours.....,1240185600,7,358,4.790322580645161
2765813,2,B000NDIB32,"I just watched this and although it is interesting I have to ask myself if it is really unbiased?  The majority of opinions come from freemasons themselves.  The whole point of this show was to prove all the theories wrong using people who disagree with these theories.  Although the narrator does bring up the theories, he does not have any opinions to back them up.  The conspiracy theories may be garbage but this show is biased garbage as well.  Something seems to be happening to a lot of history channel programs.",1230422400,12,519,4.65934065934066
2765814,4,B000NDIB32,"Generally a good balanced view of Freemasonry, with plenty of opinions from several angles and well-known writers, both masonic and non-Masonic, on the Craft.",1212624000,16,158,5.625

2765851,5,B000NDIB32,"History is very much of interest to me as try to become more acquainted with pieces of history that I am not familiar.  It seems as time passes, what I have learned in the past has become fuzzy.  I like having references that I can restore sections of history that I should have remembered from my time in school.  Thanks for making this section of history available.",1398643200,,367,4.447761194029851
2765852,4,B000NDIB32,I got this DVD as a gift for my dad who is very involved with the Masonic lodge.  He indicated that the content was good but that he had already seen the program on the History Channel.  I was a little disappointed with the fact he had seen it before but he told me it was a good program that he would recommend for others interested in a balanced perspective on different Masonic issues.,1391558400,,388,4.22972972972973

8177209,3,B000NDIB32,Same-o-samo. Just an excuse to make money without any substance. Lots of innuendoes and re-hashing of old worn-out junk that has been around for years. Not worth a view or the money spent.,1439769600,,188,4.7272727272727275
