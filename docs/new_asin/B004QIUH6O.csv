8438196,5,B004QIUH6O,Armin Only i was so hopping to see it for Monster Massive 2011 but it got cancelled. Sad face. I bought the dvd after to get the feel of what other people where able to witness and it was a great DVD with dope music. ONLY ARMIN can do this. I also loved all the other people that where involved in the show.,1379203200,,307,3.888888888888889
8438197,5,B004QIUH6O,"I put this DVD on during parties and I don't need to fire up iTunes or Spotify; Armin Van Buuren has won DJ of the year multiple times, and this live show recording always livens up the guests. The music is a nice variety of EDM (electronic dance music) so make sure you have an audio setup that can crank up the volume.",1377388800,,320,4.095238095238095
8438198,5,B004QIUH6O,"I've always wanted to get this and don't know what took me so long! It is amazing, I got goosebumps throughout the whole video. I would've cried tears of joy if I had been there live!",1359072000,,183,4.111111111111111
8438199,5,B004QIUH6O,"I can say that, I watched it already 6 times everytime when I watched it, it feels like that I'm watching it first time.  It is amazing, love it.",1358208000,,145,4.0
8438200,5,B004QIUH6O,"What a show! I only wish I could actually attend one in person, so this is the closest I'll probably ever get. The music is mixed perfectly. The live performances blend in great, especially at the end with the drum solo going with the music Armin has mixed. Just like Imagine (another great DVD), Armin's mix evokes SO much emotion throughout the performance, it's enough to send shivers down my spine. I can only imagine what it must be like live.

Overall, well worth it for those that have never seen Armin do his show live. The sound is excellent and the video isn't bad (on normal DVD - didn't purchase the Blu-Ray version). When the neon lights come on though, you can start to see the limitations of standard-def DVD (that or the original recording media was just bad to begin with). But it's not enough to detract from the overall experience.

But, overall, the colors are vibrant, the sound is crisp, the bass is excellent. When you put this in, turn up the volume and turn off the lights and get set for a Armin Only - Mirage. Top performance by a top DJ.",1357689600,,1065,4.428571428571429
8438201,5,B004QIUH6O,"I discovered Armin Van Buuren thanks to one of the songs - the first one in fact: ""Down to Love"" sang by Anna Criado - I then listened to the entire show and I really fell in love with Armin and its music and I have now many CDs et DVDs of him. Armin is the greatest in the world and if you can go and see him live it is, he is, amazing.... This DVD MIRAGE is a pure gift of Love and Music... it will make you shiver for weeks... you'll be hooked forever... this MIRAGE is real... Armin thank you you are the Mozart of the 21st century!",1353974400,,536,3.8378378378378377
8438202,5,B004QIUH6O,"great music video. I put this dvd in my blu ray player every time I clean my flat, and we all dance and clean. This is a great product and I thank you for your help.",1349481600,,165,3.611111111111111
