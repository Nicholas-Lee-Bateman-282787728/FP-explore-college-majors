3911786,5,B002DMJM7K,One Step Beyond is a great series ... the original Twilite Zone and One Step Beyond ... both classics.,1248480000,,102,4.421052631578948
3911787,5,B002DMJM7K,"Well, I have finished comparing `The Official First Season ` DVD set of One Step Beyond to the other sets previously available (Mill Creek, Delta, etc.) and I am very impressed with the difference.  All the original music seems to be intact and the murky soundtrack  that plagued those old sets with an underlying hum and hiss is now clear and clean.  The `full-screen' restored picture is not only beautiful, but has been restored to its full image.  When I played the episodes  side-by-side using picture-in-picture I discovered that the picture on the others are all unnecessarily cropped.  $35 seems a little high for a three-disk set, but I'm glad this series is getting the respect it deserves and I'm enjoying it. I only wish I had never seen them before so I could watch them all for the first time.
  One Step Beyond had a total of 97 episodes and ran for three seasons from Jan 1959 to July 1961. Twilight Zone premiered nine months later, in October 1959, and it truly went beyond its predecessor. For example on One Step Beyond a person would have a dream that the Titanic is going to sink whereas on the Twilight Zone, a person may wake up and find themselves actually on that ill-fated ship. Still, the stories on One Step Beyond are fun in a spooky sense. Season one has 22 episodes, season two 39 episodes, and season three, 36.",1245888000,224,1344,4.570833333333334
3911788,5,B002DMJM7K,Thank you CBS for releasing it. Can't wait for the other two seasons. Too bad that Mr. Newland has passed. What a great DVD extra that would have been.,1245542400,4,151,4.241379310344827
3911789,5,B002DMJM7K,"Some have called this show a forerunner of ""The Twilight Zone"", but that is not exactly true. Each segment in this series was based on paranormal events or situations that defied logical explanation. In that sense, this show was much more similar in style to ""The X-Files"", except without the long story arcs. ""The Twilight Zone"" episodes, on the other hand, were pure fiction, often written to explore some current social issue that, due to the conventions of the times, would have been impossible to talk about in a straightforward manner without igniting a controversy. Also, this show ran in parallel with ""The Twilight Zone"" rather than preceding it, running for three seasons from 1959 until 1962.

I first saw this series in the 1980's when it was running on the then-new ""Nick at Nite"", and I was fascinated by it. I have one of the old public domain packages that has about half of the total 97 episodes in it. The video and audio were passable, but you got what you paid for. The one episode that really sticks in my mind is ""Father Image"", which is actually from season two. This episode concerned a man whose father has left him some property, including an old boarded-up burlesque house. Nobody can understand why he never sold the place, until an accident causes the son to see images from his dead father's life that include his murder of a girl he was having an affair with and the disposal of her body in the burlesque house, which he closed shortly after the murder and left abandoned. The son finds the body, and would have some explaining to do to the police if it was not obvious that the girl had died years before the son was born. The episode dealt with the issue of children inheriting memories from their parents. I just mention this episode as an example of the interesting episodes that occurred in every season of the show.

You'll notice lots of guest appearances by not-yet famous stars such as Elizabeth Montgomery, Charles Bronson, Jack Lord, Warren Beatty, and Pernell Roberts. I highly recommend it. This great show has too long been in the public domain and it will be wonderful to have a restored copy.",1245456000,33,2139,4.656084656084656
3911790,5,B002DMJM7K,"While ""The Twilight Zone"" is a far better known show, due to its being shown of television so often over the years, ""One Step Beyond"" goes that show one better. Instead of stories dreamed up by writers, this series had stories based on actual unexplainable events, giving it added realism and eerieness. Finally we are treated to an official release of this superb series. After experiencing ""One Step Beyond"", other shows in the thriller genre seem rather tame in comparision. An amazing array of actors appeared on the show, including Elizabeth Montgomery, Cloris Leachman, and Ross Martin. ""One Step Beyond"", a haunting an unforgettable classic, is an absolutely essential series from the golden age of television. The stunning quality of the prints here is a big plus, so if you have any of the previous collections of the series on DVD and VHS (and there were lots of them), they can now be replaced. Interesting extras are included, too. Looking forward to Seasons 2 and 3.",1245283200,11,979,4.903614457831325
3911791,5,B002DMJM7K,"I just had to say ""thank you"" to CBS/PARAMOUNT for finally giving this series an official release. After many years of seeing nothing but old beat-up 16mm prints, I'm going to immensely enjoy seeing nice 35mm prints of this great show. I just hope all of the original music is left intact and that all 3 seasons are released. A great bonus would be to have original commercials, if available & a CD release of all the music. It's also great to see that BONANZA is getting an official release as well. I hope that CBS/PARAMOUNT continues to dig into its vaults and release more great TV treasures. My pre-order is in and I can't wait until September 15!! I hope those of you who are thinking about ordering this set will do so to ensure the release of seasons 2 & 3.

**REVIEW UPDATE** 9/16/09
Couldn't wait for it to be shipped so I went out and bought it! Audio and video quality are excellent. Now, for all you perfectionists, there are some light spots and a scratch here and there but this presentation is SOOOOO much better than anything I've seen before!! I've only watched 3 episodes so far, but they looked and sounded fine. The extended pilot episode has audio that is a little ""draggy"", but it's not very distracting. The best part is all the original music was intact. Of course, I had to watch ""The Devil's Laughter"" and all I can say is --- WOW!. I never thought I'd see this show look and sound this good. This set is well worth the money. Just as great as The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits. Sales of this show and BONANZA should be good enough to merit the release of more season sets (I hope). BTW, there's a sticker on the front that has a quote from the author of the One Step Beyond guide, John Muir. It says ""this is the presentation that the fans have been waiting for..."". I think I'll agree with that. BUY IT!!",1245283200,98,1838,4.358600583090379
3911792,4,B002DMJM7K,"An eerie, spooky-ness was present in all the episodes. Presenting the dark side, stories that were perhaps true, and John Newland trying his best to make the stories sound interesting. Most of the episodes were entertaining, sometimes better than Twilight Zone or Alfred Hitchcock Presents, or Suspense. Others fell short, but as an entire set of episodes, these were pretty good. Too bad that these are not shown on broadcast tv as reruns any longer. A whole new generation of people definitely would enjoy this series.",1445472000,6,520,5.058139534883721

This series was one I had never even heard of and boy was I glad I read some of these posted reviews!  Based on great reviews I I ordered this series and was so happy;  Wonderfully acted and well produced vignettes of stranger than fiction true stories that make you scratch your head and wonder, ""Could this really happen?""

3911798,5,B002DMJM7K,"I was too young to remember this show and I don't believe it ever aired in reruns in my area when I was a kid but I saw a few episodes late
on cable one night and thought it was awesome. I am big fan of Thriller and the classic TV horror shows and movies 30's thru 70's. I noticed
John Newland's name as director on some thrillers so I purchased the cheap dvd set and the quality is pretty bad and dvd's freeze but I got
to see enough to order this set. Glad to read that the quality is so good! I can't wait to start watching this great series and since I've only seen
a few episodes it will be like watching a new show which is a real treat in this age of horrible hollyweird crap that is made now! I love the
episode about rocks falling from the sky and the man who invented gas using water and then disappeared without a trace.",1425513600,2,831,3.9523809523809526

The beginning of the episode Echo starring Ross Martin had diagonal sparkles across the frame during the opening sequences but they disappeared when the actual story began. Maybe the beginning of the original 35mm negative to be restored was in a condition one step beyond restoration. Other that that, the remaining 21 episodes looked and sounded great in their entirety. I await the release of the restored, second season. I hope this project is in the works and will be ready for release in the not too distant future.",1420243200,4,550,4.924731182795699

3911813,5,B002DMJM7K,"One of the great science fiction or rather the godfather of shows like 'My Ghost Story' or 'My Haunted House' which are airing today. I don't know why they waited so long to release this. They did their best to remaster these, but the stock film was obviously not treated with the same care as 'The Twilight Zone', but the picture still looks good, better than any of the VHS releases. No boring episodes, they were really well done. I think It's kind of interesting to note that after this series' short run, John Newland, who hosts and directs this show, went on to write and direct a few episodes of the show 'Thriller'. That was another great genre show. There are a few extras, the extended version of the pilot, the sponsored opening of the show: ""Alcoa presents One Step Beyond"" and one audio interview. They are sure taking their time getting season 2 together, as of August 2014 still no word about it.",1407628800,3,911,4.527272727272727

After jumping through several hoops, this is the correct email: phe_customerservice AT paramount DOT com

This is the reply I received:
Greetings,
There are no plans to release the remaining seasons of ""One Step Beyond"" at this time. I will forward your request to marketing however.
Thank you,
Paramount Consumer Customer Service

So - if you want them ALL released, then email them. If not, then don't. It's totally up to all of us...

P.S. FWIW, I started a petition at petitiononline.com. It's at: (www[dot]change[dot]org/petitions/paramount-pictures-ask-them-to-release-the-entire-official-series-of-the-tv-show-one-step-beyond).

The only thing missing in this 3 DVD set is a sheet summarizing each of the episodes. You have to look at each of the specific DVD's to find out the plot of each episode.",1393804800,,413,4.294871794871795

3911821,5,B002DMJM7K,"Where is the second and third seasons?  It amazes me how people today think the current shows on TV are worth watching... Nothing is further from the truth.  Modern TV is for those on drugs, or have so little intellect, their brain just barely keeps the rest of their body alive.  Sex, violence and immorality does not make good TV.  It is boring, infantile and vacuous of anything decent and pleasant.  The little immature children would think current TV is something worthy of spending ones time.  But those who are smart and have a thinking brain and can take care of themselves know better.  The reason why CBS chooses not to release the second and remaining seasons is most likely because these old TV shows blow away any writers of today.  If you can even call them writers?  Writers now live in their mommies' basement and smoke the wonder weed, and can't even change their own diapers without a government check.

So don't hold your breath for great TV, until the minds of Hollywood are changed and real thinking mature people take positions.... We will be held hostage by the binky gang producing mindless drivel and toilet humor TV for those sucking on mommies teats even as adults....

ONE STEP BEYOND is a masterful series and should be restored and released and broadcast to build intelligent minds for our society.",1380672000,12,1328,4.730434782608696

In an age of movies and TV existing on pure shock value, it is refreshing to get back to experiencing thoughtful mystery again.
PROS: In comparison to previous releases, which I have, the quality of the mastering is exceeds in spades. For those who enjoy a good scare every now and then, can relish the contrast of deep moody blacks and transitions to shades of grey which can only be achieved in a black and white production. This was done before the advent of color TV, and can only be fully appreciated in this format.
Remastering the audio brings out a lot of subtleties which were lost in previous releases, adding to the eeriness of the stories. ""A matter of human record...."", presented by John Newland, only adds to the questions, ""What if?...Possible?.....Hmmm?""
Cons: None production wise, however, I do wish the remaining episodes are released with the same standards as this. BEFORE those of us from that era are not here to appreciate them.

Perhaps other things have come up and delays have put SEASON 2 on the back burner, I don't know. However, ALPHA DVD has a bazillion of their poorly produced, faded, splicy prints available, so there must be a ""market"" for this outstanding program.

The only problem is that now I would really like the rest of the series to finally come out on equally beautiful DVDs. Probably not going to happen.

One Step Beyond was a Twilight Zone-esque gem focusing on paranormal phenomena. Whereas Twilight Zone episodes were fictional jaunts into the unknown and strange, One Step Beyond episodes were purported to be taken from ""real"" experiences. There are some really great stories here, with excellent acting by some great actors and actresses (many from shows of the same time period, i.e. The Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock).

The Big difference is that these episodes are More Mysterious and based on Psychic Stories of actual people.
Its was done early in the days of TV so the production has you rely on your ""IMAGINATION"". If you know what this means then this show is for you,if not, don't buy it. The Sci Fi/Mystery shows that came later were based on this show.
The Great news is that C B S  has used the vault Films that were mastered to perfection!!! Whoever did this Job did it QUITE Well,Quite Well.
Unfortunately CBS cares not if we get to purchase the next seasons. On a phone call i made to a CBS executive recently he said ""We are CBS we do not have to get these shows to you at any prescribed time whatsoever!!!""
""We will get them out there when we D...M well feel like it!!!""
And with the 2 years they are taking to do that, we learn by example.
There are other Companies on Amazon that offer more shows than just one season ,But the CBS (and we do mean B.S.)
offer the Perfect Cleanest versions .Too bad they're marketing is not as clean and direct as these transfers.

Different from The Twilight Zone and other spook/thriller series of the 1950s' because it touted itself as being based on fact, the viewer therefore had to be at least open to the idea that what they were watching could really happen, rather than just watching ther sci-fi chills of Zone, for instance. I get this show, and I am thrilled to see the official release of the first season. All I've ever seen are the absolutely horrible prints in syndication, on Mill Creek, etc., and this set is a revelation - it's almost like watching the series for the first time, so greatly improved are the picture and sound. CBS has painstakingly cleaned up the original prints, and you won't end up with a headache from all the streaking, snapping and buzzing noises found in the knockoffs. Season One has the following episodes, if you're trying to decide whether or not any of your favorites are on this release: My personal opinion is that if even a couple of my favorites were included, I'd be happy, and so you can see why I give this set five stars, without any hesitation whatsoever. Now: Where's Season 2, CBS? Episodes: ""The Bride Possessed"", ""Night of April 14th (The Titanic episode)"", ""Emergency Only"", ""The Dark Room"", ""Twelve Hours To Live"", ""Epilogue"", ""The Dream"", ""Premonition"", ""The Dead Part of The House"", ""The Vision"", ""The Devil's Laughter"", ""The Return of Mitchell Campion"", ""The Navigator"", ""The Secret"", ""The Aerialist"", ""The Burning Girl"", ""The Haunted U-Boat"", ""The Image of Death"", ""The Captain's Guests"", ""Echo"", ""The Front Runner"" and ""The Riddle"".

I wasn't willing to buy a 3 episode set here and there, hoping and believing instead that some day someone would reissue this entire series in remastered glory. Finally, the wait seems to be over. Season one is a refreshing restoration of the classic show. The pilot is pristine: as good as any episode of Twilight Zone in terms of picture and sound quality. There are some picture scratches on some of the later episodes, but they are minor. This is a repackaging worthy of your hard-earned cash. The sound and picture quality are head-and-shoulders above the Mill Creek release (and presumably, any other public domain issue.) My only complaint is that seasons 2 and 3 are not already available.

I'm happy to say I was not at all disappointed.  This is a great, spooky (if at times overly talky) show that deserves its cult following.  And although I have not seen the previous budget-priced release people are talking about, I do know that for a 50 year old show, the video and audio are spectacular.

As a longtime fan of Twilight Zone, I will say that I think the comparisons between the two shows are not really accurate.  The only real similarity is that there is an on-screen narrator.  But whereas the Zone covers all realms of fantasy, science fiction and horror, OSB pretty much concentrates on psychic phenomena.  And it takes itself very seriously.  I love how, at the end of the episodes, the host will often relate what we have just seen to a real-life case (my favorite is the eerie coincidences surrounding a supposedly-fictional book that predicted the Titanic disaster 14 years before it happened).

If you're a fan, there's no doubt you must own this.  But if you missed out on this show as I did, I encourage you to pick it up.",1262476800,6,1322,4.439834024896266

It always pained me, because of this show's apparent ""public domain"" status, that inferior 16mm syndication prints hastily (and usually poorly) transferred to video were all that one could see of this excellent series.  CBS/Paramount, despite some colossal blunders as of late in their dvd releases, deserves congratulations on this release.

And they haven't tampered with the music, thank heaven.

John Newland, host and director, was an extremely talented man.  He was not only the suave and incisive host of each of the episodes, but he was an accomplished craftsman behind the camera.  His direction of actors, his pacing, his creating solid suspense sequences, his choice of camera angles and locations, his masterful use of limited sets and his exquisite taste placed him in the forefront of tv directors. If nothing else this release will remind people of just how good a director this man was.  It is interesting to note in this regard that one of the very best episodes of that other great horror anthology series of the 1960s, THRILLER, hosted by Boris Karloff, was called ""Pigeons from Hell"" which, without a doubt was one of the creepiest and most suspenseful 60 minutes ever seen on television.  That episode was directed by Newland.

I cannot recommend this dvd highly enough.  Buy it and then cozy up on your favorite couch with your wife, turn the lights down low, and - as the kids say today - get ""creeped out"".

This is the original of the strange and unusual, with the stories being taken from real events. John Newland was the quintessential host.
Everything after OSB is just a knock off.

I don't understand how Twilight Zone got so popular when it was nothing but a cheesy copy job of OSB, even going so far as to use the stars in the universe in their opening.
The fact that most people haven't seen the show since it ran on TV is the culprit though. Reruns of TZ are
to the point of being nauseating, thanks to Sci Fi channel.

Another long overdue show that I recently picked up, although not a studio release is complete series of Triller. This too was a frontrunner of the strange and unusual, with Boris Karloff as the host.

3911869,5,B002DMJM7K,"I watched ""One Step Beyond The Official First Season"" over the past 3 days. The show is finally getting the release it deserves.

First - Let's get the only video flaw I found in the entire set out of the way:

In the first 45 seconds of the episode ""Echo"" (on disc 3)there was a good bit of scratches/spots from the original film stock. (most of which was pre-opening monologue and opening title) 45 seconds out of 9 hrs 21 min

That's it!

I noticed no missing frames, Jumps, splices, audio problems or the like anywhere in this set. The episodes were sharp and a joy to watch. I suspect this is from the best 35mm stock.

I have some public domain sets, and they were watchable, but this set blows them away! Stories like The Vision, Night of April 14th, The Dark Room, The Devil's Laughter, and The Return of Michael Campion really benefit from the remastering. There are also stories which I haven't seen in the PD issues.

The set is on three single-sided discs. The extras are somewhat minimal. The best being the extended ""The Bride Possessed"" which included a John Newland series promo that I'd never seen before. Also there is another promo, the Alcoa opening, the 1990's version titles, and a 4 min. 1991 audio interview with Don Mankiewicz (with read-along subtitles).

My 5 star rating takes into account the artistic merit as well as the video. I think these are fine stories well suited to these who enjoy Alfred Hitchcock Presents, The Twilight Zone or Thriller.

One Step Beyond fans should really enjoy this well-done set.

For those unfamiliar, One Step Beyond (which began in 1959) was an anthology series which told stories of strange or supernatural events that were based on supposedly true documented cases. Subject matter included hauntings, premonitions, curses, thought transference, miracles, re-incarnation and other bizarre phenomenon.",1253836800,24,1865,4.8765822784810124

It's worth noting that all of the Harry Lubin's background music is intact (it's refreshing to have a Paramount title without the dreaded ""Music has been changed ..."" disclaimer on the back), and a real treat is the inclusion of the John Newland's ""Next Week"" previews at the end of the episodes.

ALL I WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO PARAMOUNT HERE IS THIS: THIS IS NO WAY TO TREAT FAITHFUL FANS OF THIS SERIES. I THINK WE DESERVE MORE THAN SILENCE!!!

I will be waiting this new release of ONE STEP BEYOND with great expectation. First,I really hope this new release finaly brings us fans the complete episode collection (3 seasons), half of them unavailable for a long time.
Second,I do hope we finally get a better quality product,since up until now the image and sound of those episodes available in DVD left much to be desired.

This series is not purely fictional like the TWILIGHT ZONE, and even though I enjoy TZ as pure entertainment,I prefer ONE STEP BEYOND because its producers truly made an effort to document at least some of the episodes as real-life occurrences. The most memorable of these documented episodes is the 2-part presentation about the Dutch psychic Peter Hurkos. And even though the producers took some liberty in dramatizing Hurko's life, they did present the main aspects of this extraordinary life. At the end of episode 2 the real Peter Hurkos is presented by Newland as a special guest, adding a touch of real-life docu-drama to the program. The same was done in a few more episodes (in the story of an invalid lady miraculously saved from a tsunami in Hawaii, the real-life person is also presented by Newland at the end of the program).
 After the Peter Hurkos program I was ready to look-up and read Peter Hurko's autobiography, and a second, more recent biography. For those interested in doing some further and serious research on the paranormal, these episodes do provide some first clues and pinpoint possible avenues of investigation. In this respect, they are superior to the Twilight Zone.

I do hope CBS-Paramount releases ALL SEASONS...Finally!!!!",1250380800,9,2125,5.100574712643678

I have the complete series on the old format and have since watched this story and it is mild for the action, violence and horror of today.  I am looking forward to having the improved Season 1, and hope that Season's 2 and 3 follow quickly.",1250035200,4,406,4.17948717948718

Production quality of the show was good and was interesting to see the actors from that era doing something a little different from the usual westerns, crime dramas, etc. We hope they release season two someday but if they haven't by now they probably never will. Oh well, we'll search for nostalgia somewhere else!
The product arrived quickly and in good shape. Thanks Westcoastmedia!",1520035200,,453,4.973684210526316
