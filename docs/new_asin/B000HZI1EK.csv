8165366,5,B000HZI1EK,"Few documentaries encapsulate the beauty of New York's metamorphosis from a port city to a metropolis like this series.  My Parents were fond of Al Smith, God bless him, because he was not only the first Irish American who ran for President of the United States, he was the first to challenge the political system of cronyism-Tammany Hall chicanery that existed in his time.  Al Smith brought pluralism to public service.  We owe him more than we have ever honored him for his rich lifetime of service not only to New York but to Humanity.
The DVD gives a sentimental look at the changes that came to New York City's landscape as the 20th Century dawned and the 19th Century faded into history.
I loved this documentary and I recommend it to all.",1225584000,,746,4.593984962406015
