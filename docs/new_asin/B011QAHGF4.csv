8724912,5,B011QAHGF4,"This Blu-ray disc offers the latest recording in a long series of such annual celebratory concerts. The concert, recorded in in May 2015 in the Megaron concert hall in Athens, highlights the violinist Leonidas Kavakos, a native of Athens, seen here playing to the home crowd so to speak. His performance of the Sibelius concerto on this occasion is an outstanding achievement and a vivid reminder that it was he who won the Sibelius competition as long ago as 1985.

The concert opens with a sparkling account of Rossini Semiramide Overture which has all the fizz that the composer could have dreamt of plus considerable subtlety of detail with some particularly telling pianissimo detail. There is lots of energy in this performance and an exhilarating forward momentum despite the attention to detail.

The Sibelius concerto is immediately gripping with gossamer-light playing from the orchestral strings over which the soloist makes his first entry. That attention to such detail is repeatedly apparent but so too is the strength and power of the interpretation. Kavakos plays the Il Cannone violin made by Guarneri del Gesu, once owned by Paganini, and famed for having a particularly powerful sound when played by the right person. Kavakos is obviously that sort of person.

Unlike the overture this is not a performance that is primarily memorable for virtuosic speeds, although the endings of both outer movements and the first movement cadenza certainly deliver on that sort of excitement. Rather this is a performance of considerable romantic power delivered at tempi suitably chosen to maximise that view and, as such, is a completely compelling event. The audience loved it and the encore was an essential extra. That encore was a completely different experience. The largo from Bachs sonata 3 for solo violin is here given a performance of extraordinary inner communication. The whole experience is one of appearing to be present at a very private conversation between player and composer, a very intimate event for which there could not possibly be a further encore. This was a very special moment indeed and an unmissable mark of musical greatness.

The following symphony was very much the BPO on home ground with music almost written for the orchestras tonal strengths. The tempi were well chosen to promote forward momentum while much internal detail was exposed without being disruptive to the overall dramatic purpose. This was a fine performance if not quite at the level of the previous pieces and keen collectors will be aware of other versions that they will favour from Cd discs especially. Nevertheless this marks a fine ending to a concert that fully lives up to expectations of its annual celebratory purpose.

The concert hall clearly has superb acoustics as caught by the sound engineers. The DTS master 5.0 sound is significantly superior to CD reproduction and this is easily apparent when listening without the visuals  a regular means of concentrating on the musical values of discs without the distractions of visuals. The stereo option is good but inevitably outclassed by the full surround option. The visual reproduction is crisp and truthful in tonal range while the camera work is involving and detailed without being invasive. It draws the listener into close contact with the performers while retaining overall perspectives.

This is an outstandingly successful concert on all counts and raises the bar yet further within this series.",1458259200,,3475,5.172597864768683
