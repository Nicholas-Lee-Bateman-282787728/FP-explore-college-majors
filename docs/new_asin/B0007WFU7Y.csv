8052560,3,B0007WFU7Y,"In the 2300's, interstellar travel takes place using ""inflation gates"". These gates use wormholes to pass through different dimensions. Through these wormholes, an enemy called a ""GHOUL"" comes into our world. A group of female pilots has arrived at the space station Watcher's Nest to complete their pilot training. Among them is Misaki Kureha, who lost her father in an accident at watchers nest over 10 years ago. She has come there to learn the truth. The general public isn't aware of the GHOULS. So when the new pilots encounter them, they are very surprised. Misaki learns that they are the reason her father died, and that she has a strange connection to GHOULS.

This series has good animation, and a pretty well thought out plot. The CG animation for the battle scenes is not bad. I do think that the GHOULS and the thing that Misaki turns into are kinda dumb looking. Their battles are very slow moving and odd looking. The soundtrack is very unique and not bad. There is also a lot of fan service and some nudity. The downfalls of this series are the relatively uninteresting characters, and the failure to background them. The characters have potential, but we never really get to know them, not even our heroine, Misaki. It was hard to get attached to them b/c you never get know anything about who they are as people. There were some moments that were supposed to be dramatic, but they never capitalized. Most of this series was spent with the science officer and a big shot jerk talking vaguely about Misaki's potential powers. It didn't ever develop into anything memorable. I think this series was mediocre in every aspect. It's not bad, but you're probably not going to tell your friends about it, or invite them over to watch it with you. If you can rent it before buying it, I recommend doing that before you buy it.",1353801600,2,1836,4.666666666666667
8052561,5,B0007WFU7Y,"I was pretty impressed with the first volume of Divergence Eve. With this second volume, we cross over the half way point, and are greeted with more mystery, betrayal, and a little murder to boot. The mood of the story grabs you, and it won't let go.
The animation, once again, is top notch. The 3D animation is fairly the same as the animation on the first DVD, if just a little better or sharper. Once again, despite the character design for the women being 'big' for fanservice, it's not a big issue if you concentrate on the story. The character development is TOP NOTCH! With Misaki and the rest of the team trying to become the best replacement pilot for Seraphim, the girls wish each other to succeed, but also at the same time fail, as each wants the position badly. This is realistic as who wouldn't be thinking this way? But a horrible event causes a tragic moment to occur, which leaves one of the cast to make an important choice. We also are given more info into Misaki's existence as to what she may possibly, or what she is afraid of becoming. She is also haunted by the death of her father, and how her past is coming to back to get her, literally! In order to find out the answers, a trust will be made, followed by betrayal, and the beginning of the horrible truth awaits Misaki.
ADV films rails you in with the 2nd volume, and I for a fact have been railed in to wait for the 3rd release to this splendid series. The japanese voices match fairly well, and a solid performance is once again delivered from the dub cast. As mentioned, despite the particular character design in terms of how the women are drawn, this series is actually impressive with a great plot, excellent character development, and a good chunk of action. Highly recommended to anyone who picked up the first volume and enjoyed it.",1115337600,6,1819,4.465465465465465
