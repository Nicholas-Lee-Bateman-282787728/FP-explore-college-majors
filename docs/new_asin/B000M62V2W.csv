8166681,5,B000M62V2W,"I used to watch Doctor Who about 30 years ago, and always remembered the first Sontaran story - The Time Warrior, starring Elisabeth Sladen as the new companion, Sarah Jane Smith. Over the years, Sarah Jane's character matured and when she finally left the original Doctor Who series, Tom Baker's ""The Hand of Fear"" was her most excellent swansong.

I came across this documentary-style video (a little pricey, I thought, but it was a limited edition and was signed by Elisabeth Sladen herself) and decided to see how dear Sarah Jane had aged, and to hear Elisabeth's ideas and feelings about the character and the adventures.

Very nicely done. I am glad I decided to buy it (no spoilers here, sorry!). And now with Elisabeth's Sarah Jane Smith character being reprised not only in the NEW Doctor Who series, but also with her very own ""The Sarah Jane Adventures"" (pretty well indistinguishable from the intended ""K9 and Company"" non-series) series, this particular biographical documentary takes on a whole additional meaning as an insight into the years ""between being Sarah Jane"". Well recommended.",1211068800,7,1102,5.049450549450549
