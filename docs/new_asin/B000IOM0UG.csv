8146571,5,B000IOM0UG,"My instrument is whistling so why not learn from the best? This documentary is about amazing champion whistlers from around the world. Several winning whistlers are followed from home to the big competition.

The world is so multifaceted and people who whistle for fun and with serious intent are an amazing bunch. It could have been handled like a Christopher Guest movie (a mock-you-mentary) but it isn't. I was glad. It is a movie that encourages viewers to, ""Follow your bliss!"" however off  beat.

It encourages the view to pucker up and explore your capacity to make music. I'm still whistling and appreciating it more!",1421971200,,625,4.933333333333334

8146574,4,B000IOM0UG,"Pucker Up: The Fine Art of Whistling. A rather sparsely attended annual meeting of the International Whistlers Convention. A sort of American Idol for the Depends crowd. Contestants from around the world, hence the name compete in several categories, Pop, Classical, Anything Goes (the mind boggles) and several others. Men and Women of all ages in varying degrees of formal attire, pace nervously backstage (""where's my water?"") shop-talking the competition and comparing notes (pun intended). The narration is delightful, discussing whistling's unique history. When certain arias were written for flute in the 17th century, they were also written for whistling...heh? Didn't know that did ya....as well as a wonderful film montage of the Golden Years of Whistling...like the Depression. Ya can't make this stuff up. Whistling as protection, to ward off harm, whistling as you pass a graveyard, whistle down the wind...whistling as communication; hailing a cab, because, as the techie talking heads they've brought in explain, the sound waves of a whistle are on a higher frequency level than most city sounds and therefore are noticed more readily (giddy-up). Giving pause to reflect on the relation to the ever popular whistlin' at dames passing a construction site, and what about those pesky little 7 Dwarfs....all present and accounted for.
Meanwhile, backstage there seems to be a tie in points between the show-offy professorial type from upstate NY and the contestant from the Netherlands who is seen in an earlier clip with his very elderly dad, in a wonderful duet wrought with harmony and emotion. Sincerely, a highlight. So, a ""whistle-off"" is called for only our foreign guest is unprepared for extra material. He paces and asks his wife in a jovial accent, ""Vot Abut de Bee Gee's?"" ""Nien"" She dismisses, ""hit 'em in ze heart, give em der National Anthem."" A clever marketing ploy fraulien, to which Sven says ""how bout ze Jimi Hendrix version?"" OK. now I'm having flashbacks. Some impromptu rehearsal while ...on stage, professor smarty pants does a Big Band Voodoo Swing number to a pre-recorded backing track BUT, his CD-R skips......No, this is not a Woody Allen movie. Cut to backstage, ""My knees day are shaking so...yo can hear dem!"" The foreign contestant gives a wonderfully classic rendition on stage of a Nordic infused Star Spangled Banner and the crowd (between 40 and 50 people) goes berserk. Yah hands down, the winner. Throughout the tension filled night the only female contestant, dressed in Davenport Iowa's finest, Dresses By Millie, is like a well trained pup on a new carpet, with a bladder problem. She is in circles cause she froze on the last note of the Pop category, and nothing comes out, at all. Not a peep from her as the backing track climaxes. ""Do ya think the judges noticed?"" she pleas to the others. Not to worry, she won the Best Female Whistler for that Year and made the $125 expense at Millie's all worth while. The startled look on her face really did make you forget for a moment that she was the only female in the running.
All in all a glorious celebration of how courageous we fragile humans can be when the heat is on. This documentary was made with heart, tons of it. This in no way mocked the folks, this celebrated us for who we are. And proved how we must always remember to enjoy life for its simple blessings. So much a joy to this jaded punk rocker, that this is the second time I've spent an hour viewing this in the past year. Please pass the Tums, I'm making myself nauseous, but the smile is genuine. My mom woulda cried. This is who we are as people and I'm proud to be counted as one..",1268179200,3,3657,4.82484076433121
8146575,4,B000IOM0UG,"This video follows several contestants for the International Whistling Competition.  It was what I expected, quirky in a good way. I enjoyed the way that the DVD worked in historical background on whistling and whistlers who worked the entertainment circuit in the 1920s and 1930s. Someday I hope to go see it in person. A fun glimpse into a little known area of musical competition.",1173657600,6,383,4.892307692307693
