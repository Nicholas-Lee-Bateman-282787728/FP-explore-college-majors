8628686,5,B00GYA5PYQ,"Patty has been a constant in our home for almost four years now. This new DVD is one of her best, for sure. Patty makes her stuff free on youtube but her DVD's contain material that the free stuff does not. My girls see it as a treat when they see the different variations of the videos. One of my girls' favorite songs is 'I Like Candy' so as a mom I really appreciated the new 'I like fruit' and my girls were excited as well.

I always love and appreciate how Patty combines all of the elements that draw children in and hold their attention while teaching them. Music and learning go well with preschool age kids. My kids now even make up their own songs about things going on in their lives. Patty is a modern day Mr. Rogers and a much needed entertainer in the Spongebob world!",1389139200,3,783,4.22
8628687,5,B00GYA5PYQ,"My 1.5 year old son and a 5 year old daughter (as well as myself) LOVE LOVE LOVE her music. This Dvd has been played MANY times in my house and I just received it today! The choo choo train is a big HIT with my son as well as the airplanes. She has such a positive and bubbly personality that is contagious, and we can't help but to smile laugh and giggle when she's being played. Not only is her music fun but it is also educational. I DO and would HIGHLY recommend this and ALL of Patty Shukla DVDs and Music to all.",1386201600,2,518,3.942857142857143
