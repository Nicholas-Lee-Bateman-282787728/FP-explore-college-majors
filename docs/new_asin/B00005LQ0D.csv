1623176,3,B00005LQ0D,"I do not find the movie itself homophobic, although the subject matter deals with homophobia in less than profound ways.  The central character, David, is a working class closet case who secretly loves his best friend, Theo, a straight man involved in a serious relationship with an insecure woman, Hannah.  Hannah, in turn, has recently broken up with a long-time lover due to his infidelities. David underhandedly plots to destroy Theo's relationship by preying upon Hannah's insecurities and by making her believe that the innocent Theo has been unfaithful. Theo, in turn, helps the disintegration of his relationship along (a bit too conveniently, plot-wise) by lying to Hannah about his whereabouts on a particular weekend.  After succeeding in breaking the couple up, David comes out on a national talk show (aptly referred to as ""confessional television"" by the British) and confesses his love, with unhappy results.
After reading some other reviewers' comments, I'm particularly bewildered by those who expect some type of happy denouement in which Theo sweetly forgives David and the two ride off into the sunset.  Maybe in someone's porn fantasy, but not here.  I guess my own sense of morality must be terribly quaint and old-fashioned to suggest that David has thoroughly betrayed Theo by nefariously plotting to destroy his happiness ""for Theo's own good.""  Theo discovers the truth of David's plotting, and not through David himself.  Theo's subsequent anger and violence toward David has nothing to do with David's alleged love or with homophobia, but it has a LOT to do with a scheming friend's complete betrayal.  Even if Theo were gay, is David the kind of man a reasonably adjusted person would want for a lover, let alone, friend?
As for homophobia -- the movie illustrates the day-to-day homophobia found among the English working classes (although, frankly, having lived in England, I find that the worst homophobia is found among the middle classes).  However, working class blokes are prone to reticence and have trouble discussing their emotional states, honestly captured here, which is one reason David has such a tough time emerging from his closet.  And like all closet cases, David's self-esteem is perhaps not what it should be or could be.
David's addiction to confessional TV and his determination to blow his wad on national television is peculiar and not overly convincing.  Granted, the writer sets up from the beginning David's attraction to his favorite TV show, but David's actually admitting his love for Theo in such a manner rings hollow and is in contrast to all his deviousness up until this point.  It's just not emotionally true for this up-to-now reserved character.  In fact, it's downright stupid, and I suppose one could argue that David is suddenly operating in a self-destructive mode, but I find nothing in the writing of his character to suggest that he would make such a blunder.  I think the real character, as presented, would save his confessions of love in a private moment with Theo.
The screenwriter admits that he himself is not gay and is more concerned with a triangle relationship in which betrayal plays a part.  And the screenwriter is good at illustrating this.  But the subject of living in a closet and finally coming out is, frankly, beyond his scope, and this is where the movie is flawed. Any gay man or woman knows that coming out is a process, a progression that doesn't happen in one overly dramatic flourish, on national TV, no less.  And frankly, the movie offers no evidence of any progression for David, who in reality would have to deal with a) coming out and then b) confessing his secret love.
I've mentioned the problem with the unmerited national TV confession and Theo's lying to Hannah about his weekend.  The third plot failure deals with Hannah's willingness to believe the worst about Theo based mainly on a phone call Theo receives from another woman (that David has set up).  Oh, c'mon!  No matter how insecure or tender Hannah's emotional state, the phone call would hardly constitute her going ballistic, and if she's that unbalanced then David is probably right -- Theo would be better off without her.  In conclusion, plot trickery is just not a substitute for emotional truthfulness, and this is where this otherwise watchable film ultimately fails.",1055808000,11,4346,5.025069637883008
1623177,5,B00005LQ0D,"I hear alot of negative remarks about this film, and after watching it, I wonder if these people who thought so negativly were even watching the same film?  I found that the acters played the roles quite well, the story line was very believable, and all-in-all it was a very good movie.
Watching it brought me back to a time when I was back in the closet; when I was inlove with my best friend, and I think that John Shepard was excellent at playing the part of David and getting us to feel how he did.
At the end when he admitted his sexuality, and everyone had turned on him, I noticed some people had said it was 'unbelievable'.  How could someone say that.  It happenes everyday to people all over the world.  Parents turn you away, you lose friends, get beat up.  I found it to be very believable.  And what I really liked at the end was how after his parents turned him away and he was beaten up by his best friend, He still was strong enough to say that it was the best day of his life.  I think it had a very positive ending.  I tink this was a great movie and I would highly recommend it.",1042502400,6,1097,4.117370892018779
1623178,4,B00005LQ0D,"Directed by Aisling Walsh and written by Mark Burt ""Forgive and Forget"" is a powerful and unnerving love story. Hailed by some and criticized by others I found it to be quite moving as well as disturbing. If a movie can affect you in some way, and it's something you soon won't forget, then I think it's done its job at a fine piece of storytelling. This really hits hard.
The story centers on David (Steve John Shepherd) in a remarkable performance where his brooding looks, body language, and inner turmoil just exudes from him as the story unfolds. You see, David is struggling with his sexuality and the love of another man. With parents he can't seem to talk to, working with macho construction workers, and no one to turn to but tricks he picks up at night, his undying love gets the best of him. His best friend, or mate as they say, is Theo (John Simm) inseparable since childhood. The two work together and play together and it isn't until Theo falls in love and moves in with his girlfriend Hannah (Laura Fraser) that their relationship begins to unravel. Hannah has her own past to deal with and is jealous of their friendship and sees a part of David that Theo can't. Thus she tries to wedge them apart. It's their love that drives these characters actions and feeds the fire. Reminiscent of ""Chuck and Buck"", David's obsession grows stronger and soon does what he can to break Theo and Hannah up. When he finally does he then makes the ultimate and hard decision about coming out, to himself, Theo, and the world. And although brutal, the outcome for David is one of redemption, acceptance and liberation that he proclaims is the ""happiest day of my life"". And one you soon won't forget.
I really, really enjoyed this movie. Touching, sad, intense and poignant. The climactic ending hits you over the head and wakes you up to the realities of homophobia, trust, friendship, and loyalties. Steve John Shepherd and John Simm are outstanding in their performances and the supporting cast is equally impressive. I think you'll find this to be one of either you'll love it or hate it. I loved it.
The DVD is presented in Widescreen 16:9 with chapter selection, director and writer commentary, TV spots and cast and crew bios. Soundtrack is Dolby surround. The picture quality is crisp and clear and is a nice transfer.",1038182400,9,2326,4.648058252427185
1623179,1,B00005LQ0D,I didn't like this movie. The story was weak to begin with. I was really getting sick and tired of Hanna's insecurity. Theo should not have blamed David for breaking up his relationship. If one phone call broke them up then their relationship was doomed to begin with. So I really couldn't care less about that part which took up three quarters of the film. Then David takes Theo on a talkshow and you assume he's going to tell him that he's responsible for Hanna breaking up with him but instead he tells Theo that he's gay. After that pretty much the world hates him and Theo almost kills him with a metal pipe. Great story for bigots but for the rest of us this movie is disturbing and pointless.,1025395200,8,699,4.384615384615385
1623180,1,B00005LQ0D,"This is surely one of the nastiest, most misleading, films ever made.

The only redeeming factor is handsome John Shepherd who plays David, a very closeted London construction worker.  Secretly in love with his life-long mate Theo, David's covert problems escalate when Theo announces he is moving in with his girlfriend.  Unable to share Theo's time and attention, David will do anything to undermine the couple's relationship.

David, with a misguided fantasy of 'sharing', gets the bright idea to come out of the closet on a talk show.  An unwitting Theo joins him and is utterly embarassed when he is told, in front of a national audience, that David is in love with him.

That the plan backfires goes without saying, and the pretense of light comedy ends abruptly.  David's ghastly father pronounces him sick and summarily tosses him out of the house.  Theo hates him and, to show him just how much, beats David senseless with a lead pipe.  I kid you not.

It seems that Theo and his girlfriend are a perfect match after all: they are equally smug and hateful.  Looking back with pity and loathing at the wretched, bleeding David, they walk off into the sunset together.  A perfect ending for a mean-spirited film that gay-friendly TLA should be ashamed to have produced.",1013299200,,1276,4.829493087557604
1623181,5,B00005LQ0D,"I found this movie engrossing. The characters are well developed and believable while in the best British manner there was no over sentimentality. The down to earth approach and lack of pretension is so refreshing.
The setting was good, dialogue had impact and clarity while the acting was excellent, with both main actors totally committed to their roles.
I note that others found the ending of this movie hard to take as it didn't fit their mould of being positive about being gay. The ending would have been contrived if the straight character had anything but negative feelings towards David. A positive from this is that the film is a slice of ""real life"" and as such enlightens the viewer to the realities of what being gay can be like in a world dominated by homophobia.
I rate this movie in the same class as Trick and Beautiful Thing, and more than worthy of the rating given.",1008460800,6,885,4.643312101910828
1623182,1,B00005LQ0D,"I really enjoyed this movie right up until the last fifteen minutes when it fell apart and turned exceedingly nasty, ugly, and senselessly violent.
For the first 75 minutes, this is an engaging film.  It deals with two lifelong friends, plasterer David (Steve John Shepherd) and Theo (John Simm).  David is gay, but has admitted this to no one, especially Theo, whom he loves.  Their friendship is tested when Theo falls in love with the attractive, but insecure, Hannah (Laura Fraser).  David and Hannah see in each other a threat to their own relationship with David, and they each take steps to undermine the other.  It's petty, it's painful, but it's human.  The performances by the three leads are realistic and heartfelt.  The script by Mark Burt and the direction by Aisling Walsh are solid when they deal with the three leads.  (I am less convinced by the direction of, writing of, and acting by David's coworkers.)
However, the movie falls completely apart in the last fifteen minutes.  The climax takes place on the set of a fictional TV show called ""Forgive and Forget"" where one guest admits a transgression while the sinned against listens and declares whether he or she can forgive and forget.  After David does something that drives a wedge between Theo and Hannah, he arranges an appearance on the show for him and Theo.  I assumed that it would be to admit what he'd done that hurt Theo's relationship with Hannah.  That would have made for good storytelling.
Instead, writer Burt wrenches the story in a completely different direction, and one that has caused other reviewers here to call the film homophobic.  It's hard not to agree with that assessment.  Burt has David ask forgiveness from Theo for being gay, as if this is something that must be forgiven!  As offensive as that is, the final scene where the two confront each other after the show is even more heinous and completely undermines the rest of the movie.  It is ugly, it is violent, and the last image of Theo walking away from David implies that writer Burt and director Walsh endorse the actions taken by the character Theo.  It's thoroughly repulsive.
I can not, in good conscience, recommend this to anybody.
I have not listened to the commentary track, although there is one.  I'm not sure I want to listen to Mark Burt and Aisling Walsh trying to justify their work.
I would suggest giving this a skip and go directly to the British ""Queer as Folk (series one)"", ""Get Real"", ""My Beautiful Laundrette"", ""Maurice"", or ""Boyfriends""

1623183,4,B00005LQ0D,"FORGIVE AND FORGET

(UK - 1999)

Aspect ratio: 1.78:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Digital

The life of young, working-class David (Steve John Shepherd) is thrown into turmoil when his best friend Theo (John Simm) - with whom David is secretly in love - sets up home with art student Hannah (Laura Fraser), sidelining David, perhaps forever. David's subsequent attempts to disrupt Theo's relationship with Hannah and come to terms with his own sexuality has far-reaching, potentially devastating consequences...

Aisling Walsh's British telefilm - which takes its title from a cringe-making TV confessional show that figures largely throughout the film - examines the theme of a strong relationship threatened by an outsider, and is set against the backdrop of London's ultra-macho building trade, an aspect which dispels the possibility of gay stereotyping whilst simultaneously turning the dramatic screws for the central characters. But our sympathies for David - consolidated in a heart-wrenching scene when Theo asks him: ""How do you tell someone you love them?"", blithely unaware of David's feelings, and oblivious to the turmoil which such a question might provoke - are neatly challenged by his selfish betrayal of Theo's romance with Hannah. How the viewer reacts to the complex ambiguity of the closing sequence depends on how far you're prepared to 'forgive and forget' David's blind, reckless stupidity.

Walsh and writer Mark Burt recorded an audio commentary for the original US DVD release, where it became obvious they intended the movie for a predominantly straight audience. David's sexuality is never explored in any great detail and is used as little more than a device to facilitate the drama, though some gay viewers may find this matter-of-fact approach unusually refreshing. But while director and author provide a detailed analysis of the creative decisions which affected the outcome of individual sequences - the use of locations, color schemes, etc. - they make no attempt to engage with the brief controversy which blew up (in the UK, at least) over the film's ending. Were they even aware that some gay viewers were bitterly divided between those who thought the film simply explored the consequences of betrayal, and those who believed the climax was profoundly homophobic? Viewers are urged to see the movie and decide for themselves.

Though hidebound by the usual TV restrictions, the film's modest production values are thoroughly professional throughout, while Walsh's unobtrusive direction and Kevin Rowley's discreet camerawork allows a superb cast of familiar British actors - including Maurice Roeves and Ger Ryan (the latter went on to feature in the UK version of ""Queer as Folk"") - to illustrate those small, distinctive characteristics which define the Common Man (and Woman). But the film is anchored by Simm and Shepherd, both veterans of quality TV drama, and widely recognized as two of the finest actors of their generation. Here, they're quietly impressive as close friends who are ultimately divided by their separate needs, and they're given fine support by Laura Fraser as the hapless object of their concerns.

Though intended for television, FORGIVE AND FORGET played theatrically in venues all over the world, mostly in festival slots.",1003449600,28,3291,5.353965183752417
1623184,2,B00005LQ0D,"Despite the efforts of a capable cast, ""Forgive and Forget"" is otherwise a shipwreck of a movie, one that ultimately sinks under the weight of its own dishonest conceits.  Blame the screenwriter, Mark Burt, and the director, Aisling Walsh, for creating inherently unlikable characters and placing them in an unbelievable - and even offensive - set of circumstances.

Tall, handsome David (Steve John Shepherd) is a closeted, conflicted gay man who still lives at home with his homophobic parents and works for his father's construction business.  David's life is centered around running, smoking, drinking, and having empty sexual encounters.  He's also addicted to watching a reality television show named ""Forgive and Forget"", in which people who have harmed one another confront their pasts and decide whether to forgive and forget.  David is secretly in love with his best friend Theo (John Simm), an unremarkable looking, and rather bland, straight guy with whom he runs and smokes and drinks.  When Theo falls in love with Hannah (Laura Fraser), a deeply neurotic and bitter young artist who also runs and smokes and drinks, David deviously plots to sabotage his friend's romance, and later, to make a desperate - and very public - play for him.  David's plan goes awry, and the movie abruptly ends on an unhappy note for almost everyone involved.

There is a disturbing and unappealing thread of anti-gay sentiment that runs throughout this unpleasant little made-for-Scottish-television movie.  In truth, David's sexuality only comes into play so that the piece would have a gay villain; the story would have worked just as well (or maybe better) had David been a straight man motivated by an interest in seducing Theo's girlfriend.  Besides the messed-up David, the only other gay character who receives much screen time is the prissy, effete man who has hired David's company to renovate a building, and who is mocked and ridiculed by the construction workers.  Even in the cast and crew biographies which comprise one of the DVD ""extras"", ballet dancer-turned-actor Shepherd and screenwriter Burt takes special pains to point out that they are, in fact, totally straight ... as if the world needed to know, or might care.

Homophobic undertones aside, the script is incredibly inconsistent and manipulative.  For example, the film cuts to many episodes of the titular TV series, ""Forgive and Forget"".  The host (well-played by actress Meera Syal who oozes just the right amount of smarmy and insincere concern for her guests) always - always - asks the participants, ""Are you ready to forgive and forget?""  That, after all, is the show's concept, its theme, its reason for being ... except, of course, when Theo and David make an appearance.  In their episode - which, unbelievably, is broadcast live - all the rules and conventions of the show are conveniently tossed out the window without logic or reason, and they are never asked the familiar closing question.  This is sloppy filmmaking, when the writer and director paint themselves into a corner and then ""cheat"" their way out for the sake of moving the story along, and it's an insult to the audience's intelligence.

I'm going to give this DVD a rating of two stars, because the actors clearly gave it their best shot, despite the inadequacies of the script and direction.  However, I would discourage any of my friends and family from wasting their time watching it, and accordingly, I will not recommend it to you either.",1296864000,,3493,5.054006968641115

From my point of view, straight men can ""love"" gay men as an alternative to their first choices for sexual companion(s).  Thinking that a straight man will change to homosexual preferences because of the feelings of the gay man towards him (the str8 man)is a hazardous assumption.

I had such high hopes for this movie.  Oh well...",1254182400,2,460,4.493975903614458
1623186,4,B00005LQ0D,"FORGIVE AND FORGET was originally written by Mark Burt and directed by Aisling Walsh as a TV movie aimed at a straight audience in the UK. That fact is important to remember as it makes this excellent film more credible to the audience that is finding it negative. The world at large remains homophobic as is evident not only in the US with all the measures before the voting public about gay rights, but also with the unrelenting gay bashing around the world in virtually every country.  FORGIVE AND FORGET attempts to defuse some of that irrational behavior, yet sadly it only succeeds on some levels: some are still either incredulous that this story could happen and end the way it does while others quietly nod in recognition of a an atmosphere that remains essentially unchanged with the apparent passage of time's enlightenment.

Working class plasterer David (Steve John Shepherd) and perennial student Theo (John Simm) have been best friends (mates) for fourteen years, David the larger of the two being Theo's protector and defender.  They are devoted to each other in the best  sense of the word.  Theo begins seeing artist Hannah (Laura Fraser) who is still recovering from a broken relationship with an unfaithful guy.  As the couple's relationship intensifies, David sees his mate moving away from him emotionally, a fact that is made more difficult due to the fact that David is a closeted gay man, still living with his virulently homophobic parents, and in truth is deeply in love with Theo.  Theo tries to bring David into his new life with Hannah, but David resists, begins having meaningless sexual encounters in Soho,  and gradually finds ways to weaken Theo and Hannah's new relationship by playing on Hannah's insecurities.  David's attempts at finding time together with Theo result in weakening Hannah's trust and she leaves Theo. As the truths of David's desperate attempts to retain Theo to himself become apparent, Theo questions David's motives.  David, unable to talk with anyone, opts for going on a popular UK confessional TV show ('Forgive and Forget') where he admits he is gay and declares his love for Theo, a public announcement that results not only in David's being disowned by his parents but also in being beaten bloody by Theo, a sad dnouement stopped only by Hannah's intrusion during the beating.  The only positive aspect of David's public confessional is that at last he is free of the lie he has been living, and though he has seemingly lost everything, he at last has some peace of mind - a tragically confessed happiest day of his life.

The cast is homogenously excellent, but the quality of acting by the exceedingly handsome and charismatic Steve John Shepherd and by John Simm and Laura Fraser is exceptional.  Whether the audience is deeply disturbed by this film or closely aligns with its message, the film as an artwork cannot be faulted.  It is a brave little movie that dares to hold a mirror up to the audience, hopefully enlightening at least a few as to the perpetuated homophobia that maligns the lives of many citizens.

1623187,1,B00005LQ0D,"Hated everything else.  It's a boring, irritating, slow piece that isn't nearly as clever or fun as it seems.

I loved the lead (acting, body language, look, everything) and didn't mind his best friend, but the story takes way too long to unfold and there are a whole bevy of uneccessary and unimportant (and uninteresting) characters which confuse the sloppily-told story and you'll be reading the synopsis to find out what the director was trying to tell you.  (Because it isn't at all clear.)

Unfortunately the story spins totally out of control with unbelievable and impossible story twists that ruin whatever small amount of empathy you might have for the characters.  Nobody comes out of this looking good.

Then there is the violence and homophobia which the director seems to think we enjoy watching.  As entertainment, this stinks, and it's actually offensive at points.

""Forgive"" might be worth watching for Steve John Shepherd and to see for yourself how you feel about it, but as entertainment, it's awful.",1120867200,5,1020,5.029761904761905
1623188,2,B00005LQ0D,"Forgive and Forget, directed by Aisling Walsh, is a story about David (Steve John Sheperd) a plaster mason who is in love with his long time best friend Theo (John Simm) who is straight and moves in with the girl of his dreams Hannah (Laura Fraser). As Theo and Hannah get closer, David begins to feel threaten with the loss of a friendship and his long time secret love. What emerges is a deceptive ploy by Daivd to derail the couple and solidify his feelings for Theo.

  This movie starts off very promising with solid character development and the interactions between David, Theo and Hannah runs smoothly. The script and director do a nice job of letting the romance of Theo and Hannah flourish, while David pines away and is slowly comsumed with jealousy and fear of losing something he never really had (Theo's romantic love interest). As the movie comes to its end it starts to fall apart, the utter violence that consumes Theo as he tries to beat David (with a pipe) is so against character and misplaced it comes across as ridiculous. The idea that David tells Theo about his love on a talk show is just as foolish since the script has him so far in the closet it would take a burning house to get him out. In the end what you won't forget or likely forgive it the inability of the writer or director to take control of this ending and make it a meaningful message instead of some poor attempt of David attaining sudden blissful insight after his beating.",1118534400,6,1465,4.5
1623189,4,B00005LQ0D,"I enjoyed this film very much.  It strikes a common chord for a lot of gay people who have suffered rejection and pain for their coming out of the closet.  How many can identify with the lead character David, obviously suffering from the depression of an unrequited love for his best straight friend of fourteen years, a fellow named Theo.  What gives this film merit is that they made the gay character straight acting, devoid of all feminine stereotypes that most gay films project into their lead gay characters.  In an ironic twist, his best friend, Theo, played by John Simm is decidedly feminine acting and looking yet he is the straight guy.  Unfortunately, Simm and the actress who plays his girlfriend have NO chemistry, thus making their relationship implausible.  If it is true that gay people look for ""looks in a person first"" rather than personality, then this movie proves that this is a myth.  I liked the fact that David, who could have any man he wanted (because HE is the good looking one) saw beyond Theo's average looks and felt a genuine, albeit, obsessive and unhealthy love for him.  One sympathizes with David because he is so obviously miserable having to stand by and watch his best friend get it on with the girlfriend, and then hear the details afterward.  Again, how many gay people have ever been in this situation?  It is a common occurrence in the gay community.  Another implausibility is the ""coming out on a talk show"" with a near ""Jenny Jones"" type of fiasco at the end with Theo nearly beating David to a pulp until his girlfriend, who inexplicably and conveniently shows up and stops him from killing David.  One can't believe that Theo would have THAT much violence and hated toward David, no matter what drove David to break up the relationship between Theo and the girlfriend.  John Simm (Theo) did not play the aspect of homophobia convincingly enough to warrant his attack.  The film ends with David serenely contended in a lush, green park, free at last.  Free from hiding, yes, but free from his love for THeo?  I think not. The film was, indeed, realistic in its attempt to portray the consequences of coming out and a homophobic society.  However, the end result is that, in my opinion, one is not entirely convinced that Theo would abandon David in such a violent way.  Not after being taken care of and defended by David for fourteen years.  Thanks to the fine portrayal of the actor who played David, this film has merit because he made the character sympathetic and identifiable, despite some of the malicious things he was driven to do for the sake of his love for Theo.

As Theo is about to inflict a fatal blow, his girlfriend yells ""Don't"" he freezes, drops the lead pipe and walks over to her; they glance down and David writhing in pain with a pathetic look on their faces and exit the building. The next scene shows David lying in the grass with a look of selfsatisfaction and relief of comming to terms with himself; freed from the bonds of denial and guilt one experances from being in the closet.

Forgive and Forget, is the name of a talk show, (which appears throughout the movie), in Britain where ppl, couples, friends etc. come to resolve there differences or conflicts live on the air on T.V.

David and Theo have been best friends, ""mates"", since school days. They work together on Davids fathers construction job. Theo has just moved in with his girlfriend; but there appear to be some tension between the two that mounts and increases as the film progress'es. David too has a conflect boiling and churing within himself. Is it about himself? Is it about another issue? Wer'e not quite sure as the plot or theme of this film is not quite evident; as you just move from one scene to another in these ppl's lives, not sure where the film is taking you or wants you to go, you just move along aware that tensions are building; for awhile I wasn't sure if this was even a gay movie; but foreign films tend to be that way, compared to their American conterparts which have the plot and theme established earlier on. In the end David tries to resolve his conflict but his life collapses around him and he loses all; his parents, Theo, and Theo's girlfriend who, never really like him to begin with so no loss there.

 I gave this film only 4 stars as it lost my attention through most of the movie until the end when everthing, then becomes apparent; and the ending is worth viewing as it made me reflect on what could or has happened to gay ppl when they come out to their family and friends and the rejection and violence they have encountered.",1094601600,,2076,4.440944881889764

In fact, the ending, be warned, was a bit disturbing, perhaps a bit TOO harsh, but despite this, I still have to say it was good movie.  I appreciated the film  most for the actor who played the role of David, the main character,...his  performance was outstanding.  Rent this movie, but prepare yourself for an ending that will leave you feeling far from happy.",1068508800,2,520,4.559139784946237

Sometimes the path we decide to take ends up in a different place than we expected.  David decides to use talk show television to tell Theo of his love for him. The reaction is something he did not expect.  This is a good movie.  Well acted, with a good story line.  It you want ""lived happily ever after"", this movie is not for you.

7944330,5,B00005LQ0D,"Wow. Previous reviews almost dissuaded me from doing it, but I am very, very glad I watched this movie. (What I am about to write may contain >>SPOILERS<<, but I am simply responding to what other reviewers have already written.)

My reaction to this movie is almost exactly the opposite of most other reviewers. I think it got much BETTER at the end, not worse; I think Steve John Shepherd is the weakest actor in the cast, not the best (although it is an extraordinary cast, so he is still very good); I think the responses of his parents (who do NOT brutally reject him (his father SAYS they still love him), they only insist that he leave them alone for a while to deal with the shock) and Theo (David started the violence, not Theo; and David is much bigger and stronger, so using a weapon makes sense) are entirely credible and honest under the circumstances, not at all monstrous or inappropriate; and Hannah had seen the TV show, so her appearance at the end is not at all out of the blue.

The end is strong and very, very positive: David knows himself better than we do, so when he says it is the best day of his life, I believe him. This is a brilliant movie.

(By the way, I am delightedly and militantly gay, and I abhor gay bashing, but there was NONE of it in this movie! As I said, David hit Theo first, Theo hit him back twice with the pipe - and NEVER in the head, so he was not trying to kill him - and what Theo said to David at the end he said because he was deeply hurt and terrified, not because he hates gays.

(Theo is a sweet, sensitive, weak and wimpy guy who had loved and depended on David since they were children, and his world had just been blown to bits on national TV. Give him a break! David is stronger than he is, in every way. It is GOOD, not bad, to see a movie with a strong gay lead! That he can get beat up, alienate his family and only friend, and still say it is the best day of his life is great! This guy is a hero, not a victim.)",1308700800,,1976,4.098191214470284
7944331,4,B00005LQ0D,"Fans of Alan Clarke and early Mike Leigh will be pleased with this social realist film from Scotland that does something all too rare: it presents the subject of homosexuality from the perspective of the working class, where traditional masculine values often reign supreme.  The feel-good gay cinema that we have come to know in the U.S. is entirely predicated precisely on a lack of social realism where class is concerned (America tends to be ""class-blind"" anyway, for better and for worse).  The gay men are always somehow magically steadily employed in some white-collar field, they live in swanky apartments, they drive nice cars -- loneliness or cheating or extended family are the only problems that enter their world.

Forgive and Forget, by contrast, is about a construction worker named David whose sole identity comes from being a job foreman, a breadwinner and a protector -- and he's gay.  And in love with his best friend, whose typically hetero problems with sustaining relationships with women lead the construction worker to think that perhaps he has a chance to move in on this guy.

David is not a smart, clever, educated gay; he drinks beer and believes what he sees on television.  He poignantly tries to make sense of his feelings, given a limited means of expression and severely limited social power.  Yes, it's desperation, verging on the insane, and yes the ending flirts with a kind of masochistic gay self-hatred that will unnerve many viewers.  But the world is smaller for some than it for others, and options are fewer.  Just as we need more films about gay men of color, we need more films about working class gays.  Forgive and Forget opens that painful but necessary conversation.",1305417600,3,1715,4.923611111111111
7944332,3,B00005LQ0D,"The title of this film comes from a tv-show, which the main character is a fan of. David is a straight looking (and acting) guy, coming from working class. He stays in closet, being secretly in love with his bestfriend Theo.
Things get complicated the moment Theo moves in to his girlfriend.
I am gonna spare you more details. The story is based on what seems to be a feeling triangle between a gay and his straight friend and a girlfriend of the latter one.

But...Unfortunately the director and scriptwriter lost their idea how to end their work, while filming it. After first 70 minutes the plot gets more and more odd. I cannot find any reason to justify behavior of both David and Theo (how come a typical ""closet case"" goes for .... to tell about his feelings????). The ending is more than unpleasent, almost horrific.
This could have been one of the more interesting gay theme movies. It's a shame that the final product is spoiled by lack of invention? lack of consequence in telling a story?
I leave the answer up to you.

Neverthless, it is worth to watch.",1302220800,,1066,4.546875
