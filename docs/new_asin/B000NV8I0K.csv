8181482,5,B000NV8I0K,A great way to learn on how to draw dinosaurs. It was a great buy. I did learn a lot of dinosaur anatomy. Buy it.,1399766400,,113,3.56
8181483,5,B000NV8I0K,"This is another excellent DVD by Gnomon. David breaks down the anatomy into its basic components and makes it very easy to visualize what you want to draw. I was afraid this would be more anatomy than drawing, but it's a great mix with a number of excellent tutorials on drawing many different dinosaurs from basic construction to finished artwork",1360454400,2,347,4.8
8181484,5,B000NV8I0K,"This is one of Gnomon's best DVDs. David knows his business, the science of dinosaurs. In this, he discusses gesture, anatomy, muscle deformations, surface shading... all the elements necessary for you to create relatively accurate dinosaur sketches. (while he's accurate, most of us probably are not)

This DVD is pure instructional excellence, mixing passion and knowledge to create a focussed, succinct video treatise on drawing these dramatic animals from the past.",1228176000,2,469,5.605633802816901
