In a way CL carries the whole concert, she's dancing, rapping, singing, and never sounds off or looks tired the entire time. Her presence just demands your full attention. I'm not a Blackjack but I was sooooo impressed by this concert. The only slight complaint is the packaging which looked a bit cheap in my opinion. I also bought the BigBang Alive Concert DVD and it had way nicer packaging. The 2NE1 girls deserve just as much love and attention as BigBang. They're certainly no less talented. If you only buy one 2012 concert DVD BUY THIS ONE.

Hwaiting 2NE1!!",1367280000,,665,4.635593220338983
