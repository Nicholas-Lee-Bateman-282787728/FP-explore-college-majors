7915268,2,B000021YXB,I don't think the DVD is basic.  You are told what to do but not how to do it.  I would not recommend this DVD to anyone unless they already know how to implement the practices.,1389830400,,177,3.888888888888889
7915269,5,B000021YXB,"I go back to this video frequently and always hear something new. Dominique and Debra explain, demonstrate and reveal their approach.",1300579200,,133,5.380952380952381
7915270,4,B000021YXB,"I loved this video. My daughter and I have been taking lessons for six years, but we both learned a lot from this video. I recommend it.

One thing you should know, though, is that it's only 30 minutes long. That was very disapointing. Also, you won't be able to ""Master the Basics"" using this video. Lunge-lining is glossed over, but is covered in his other video, French Dressage.",1114732800,,382,4.536231884057971
7915271,2,B000021YXB,"Mr. Barbier's Mastering the Basics video was an audio delight. His attitude and approach to lightness and partnership can serve to be an inspirational message to trainers who struggle daily with horses that, through previous forceful methodology, have become lumbering, difficult and resistant. Unfortunately the visual elements of this particular video, at best do not compliment and at worst mock the enlightening narration. His horses appear compressed and over-bent and traveling too much sideways to deliver a light ride. His instruction, although pleasant to listen to, is unproductive and  his riding seems thoroughly contradictory to what he is saying. I have had the pleasure of watching his previous videos and they are far superior to this decimation of what used to be the purity of his French Classical work. I fear he has sold out in order to be more commercial. I hope this is not true.",982454400,32,901,5.129251700680272
7915272,3,B000021YXB,"Mr. Barbier's philosophy is wonderful to hear and highly recommendable.  Regretfully, my praise must end there as the visuals in this video clearly demonstrate that old ""do as I say, not as I do"" principal.  We are treated to visions of lovely horses being over bent in the neck, compressed into their shoulders by pulling hands (both his and his students) and horses who cross over their hind legs instead of bringing them forward in the shoulder-in.  Mr. Barbier's first video was  the reason I pursued Classical French Dressage in the first place (for which I must thank him).  What a pity he has chosen to allow ""modern techniques"" to dictate his current methodology.  Save your money and buy his ""Intimacy in French Classical Dressage"" instead.",981936000,26,749,4.904761904761905
