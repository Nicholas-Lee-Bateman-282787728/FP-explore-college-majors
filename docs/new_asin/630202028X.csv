While Pleasance is my favourite Blofeld (and Mike Myers based his  Dr. Evil a lot on him) his character has a very inane plot which borders on  really campy.",940723200,,312,4.535714285714286
413312,4,630202028X,"You Only Live Twice remains one of the best of the James Bond films, combining an intriguing premise - albiet one with some prohlems - with a strong mixture of great cimematogrophy, great action, and a strong cast.

Twice's primary strength lies in introducing James to Japan. Here Bond is a fish out of water, as the film plays up his struggle to adapt to a culture so different from the ones he's encountered before.  It is this quality that helps explain what many other reviewers claim to be a phoned-in quality to Sean Connery's performance.  Connery was disenchanted with the Bond series, for sure, and some of his athletic moves lack the crispness one would expect, but Connery's performance, despite a few portions where he really does phone it in, is still superb.

The basic plot revolves around the disappearence of several spacecraft.  The disappearence of the US ship Jupiter 16 opens the film, highlighted by John Barry's genuinely frightening music cue as another spacecraft remorselessly approaches the ship and encases it within its belly, severing the lifeline of an astronaut and letting him float to spatial asphyxiation. The uncredited roles of Ed ""Colonel Straker"" Bishop (of UFO and Captain Scalet & The Mysterons) and Shane ""Scott Tracy"" Rimmer as tracking station technicians add strikingly to the scene.

The US and Soviet Russia blame each other for the disappearences, to the point where both go to nuclear alert - much to the delight of the real culprits, SPECTRE.  Donald Pleasance marks the series' first appearence of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, until now seen only at angles hiding his scarred face. Pleasance completely commands the role, making Blofeld a genuine menace with the ugly scar on his face and his ruthless disposal of inept followers.

Karin Dor is the film's femme fatale, Number 11, first seducing James (how much most male viewers wished the film had carried through to completion the sex that ensues upon Bond's disrobing of her), then trapping him on a stricken airplane.  Blofeld finds that Bond is alive and takes his revenge by dropping Number 11 into an indoor pool filled with piranhas - one of the most chilling scenes of a film series replete with such.

The film's major action set piece is an assault by Japanese SIS on a ""dead"" volcano that is SPECTRE's hideout.  The battle is exceptionally harrowing, machines guns and death exploding everywhere, and is among director Lewis Gilbert's finest moments, and it is enhanced by the recent remix of the film's sound effects track, adding updated peripheral sound effects where needed and also toning down some of the explosion and gunfire effects - the most striking example comes in the scene were a Ninja is planting explosives on the underside of the volcano base's roof door; in the original gunfire sounds explode everywhere, but in the remixed version they are toned down during the closeup scene to barely audible, with only the metallic clanging of the Ninja moving about the girders to be heard.  This remixing is striking in its effectiveness. and the overall contrast of the chaos at the volcano and the tense calm at The Pentagon as the US prepares to attack Russia is chilling.

The film's special effects are generally amateurish by modern standards, regrettable because otherwise the film is very elaborate and entertaining and is a favorite of the Connery Bonds.",932947200,,3380,4.971631205673759
413313,3,630202028X,"Sean Connery's fourth adventure as 007 is his least captivating.  SPECTRE, headquartered in a spectacularly designed dormant volcano, is meddling with USA and Russian space capsules, raising tensions to a high.  With each side  threatening action, Bond had his work cut out for him.  The film boasts a  spectacular look at the people and cultures of Japan, but the screenplay is  seriously lacking.  Roald Dahl's screenplay discards the elements of the  excellent Ian Fleming novel and opts instead for half-hearted attempt at a  Bond action thriller.  ""Twice"" isn't at all a bad movie, but it  pales in comparison to its predecessors in the series. As far as casting  goes, the major problem is with the main villain, Ernst Stavros Blofeld,  the head of SPECTRE.  Donald Pleasance, a very talented actor, is all wrong  for this particular role.  His Blofeld speaks in a cold monotone and has a  rather bizarre appearance, but is just not suited for the character.  He is  menacing only in the least, and this is not how Blofeld should come across.  However, the film has several memorable action sequences, as well as the  previously mentioned volcano set, expertly designed by Ken Adam for the  price of $1 million (the entire budget of ""Dr. No!"").  For these  reasons, its worth watching.",911520000,3,1291,4.953051643192488
413374,4,630202028X,"Sean Connery's first break from James Bond comes from an exceptional if slightly overdone turn in the fifth James Bond adventure.

A conflict between the US and the USSR over an encounter in space is causing both to veer into nuclear war. Odd that this movie would bring to fold nuclear war, half a decade after the Cuban Missile Crisis. But its a James Bond story and one that is a pretty cool, but a bit outrageous. Taking it from Hong Kong to Japan, this story has some pretty cool moments. However for fans of the original novel the only good thing that this does bring is Bond vs the mysterious man with the cat in an encounter with the world in danger.

Trademark James Bond storytelling from one-liners, amazing sets, action, lovely women and gadgets are to be expected here.

413376,3,630202028X,"After four consecutive films in as many years, there was a two year wait before You Only Live Twice arrived in theaters.  While sharing the title with the eleventh novel written by Ian Fleming, this film was the first to diverge completely from the written material mainly because one of the main storylines of the book could not be covered because it had not occurred in any previous film.

An American spacecraft is hijacked from orbit by a SPECTRE spacecraft resulting in the United States accusing the Soviets, who deny it.  The British suspect Japanese involvement since the unidentified craft landed in the Sea of Japan.  Upon faking his death, James arrives in Japan to investigate meeting with Aki, the MI6 station chief, and then Akis boss Japanese secret service chief Tiger Tanaka.  Bond identifies Osato Chemicals as being a part of the plot, meeting with Mr. Osato and his security Helga Brandt, and identifying a suspicious cargo ship owned by Osato.  After a failed investigation of the cargo ship, Bond almost killed by Brandt but is able to escapes death but results in Brandt being killed by the head of SPECTRE who orders Osato to kill Bond.  Then SPECTRE hijacks a Soviet spacecraft resulting in the Soviet Union to blame the Americans as tensions rise.  While investigating an island the cargo ship had passed, Bond battles helicopters confirming the islands importance.  Tanaka develops a plan to crash train Bond as a ninja, disguise him as a Japanese fisherman to be married to a local woman, and search for the base so Tanaka can attack with a force of 100 ninjas.  During the process, an Osato henchman kills Aki making things personal for Bond.  Bond proceeds with Tanakas plan and with his wife Kissy discover the SPECTRE base, Kissy goes to inform Tanaka while Bond infiltrates the base.  Discovering the missing Astronaut and Cosmonauts, Bond attempts to get on board the SPECTRE spacecraft but is spotted by SPECTREs mastermind Ernst Stavro Blofeld.  While meeting Blofeld, Tanakas forces attack the base and a timely intervention by Bond allows some into the base.  Blofeld retreats killing Osato and orders a henchman to kill Bond.  Bond defeats the henchman and is able to destroy the SPECTRE spacecraft before it can hijack another American spacecraft.  Blofelds sets off the bases self-destruct forcing Bond and Tanakas forces to escape through a former lava tunnel to be rescued by Japanese and British maritime units.

Unlike the previous installment, You Only Live Twice set a narrative pace that was steady throughout the film keeping the viewer engaged in the film.  Setting the film nearly all the scenes in and around Japan was a departure from previous Bond films, however it helped keep the film focused while still giving spectacular background visuals throughout the film.  Roald Dahl wrote the screenplay with collaboration from director Lewis Gilbert, resulting in a singular vision of the film that helped the overall product.  Yet the film isn't without some flaws, some unfortunate and others detrimental.  The most unfortunate is the running time, which could have been cut in several places including some action sequences that ran just a tad too long.  The other was the reliance an formulas, some of which Dahl commented on in later interviews that he was told to include while being given free rein over the rest of the story, that over the course of five films were getting stale.  But the biggest flaw was Ernst Stavro Blofeld, who made his debut as a little, scarred, bald man played by Donald Pleasence.  With three of the previous four Bond films having involved SPECTRE, the reveal of Blofeld is somewhat of a letdown considering that both Dr. No and Emilio Largo were both more intimidating and overall more impressive antagonists for Bond to faceoff with.  What does not help is that Pleasences Blofeld is the go to megalomaniacal villain that parodies of all Bond and spy genre films go for.

You Only Live Twice is a fun, good paced film but when compared to the previous four films of the Connery era there are problems that an observant viewer can pick out.  Although this was meant to be Connerys swansong as the titular character, he didn't call in his performance but there are issues that hurt the overall product that were out of his control.  Overall its a nice film, nothing better or worse.",1514160000,,4367,4.904761904761905

The best part of the movie, and that truest to the novel, is Bond interacting with Tiger Tanaka and becoming Japanese.  All the stuff about SPECTRE capturing space crafts and trying to start a war is the overactive imagination of the screen writers for this movie who thought that the formula for all Bond movies should be Bond again saves the world from total destruction.

413434,5,630202028X,"You Only Live Twice (1967) is a solid Bond offering; it's Sean Connery's last appearance as 007 (with this being his fifth consecutive Bond film) before leaving for one film (On Her Majesty's Secret Service) then resuming his portrayal of Bond in Diamonds are Forever. This film is very unique in its setting, aesthetic, and overall feel. This is probably the most violent of the Connery films, so those who like a lot of action and violence, then this film is for you. There is a uniqueness to this film, in that it features an array of settings, from outer space to underwater scenes to Japanese settings. Also, Roald Dahl (of all people) wrote the screenplay, which I thought was pretty good. Nancy Sinatra opens the film with a nice song; her singing and the song in general are sort of hypnotic and relaxing, and is one of the best Bond theme songs of all time. You Only Live Twice is a solid Bond film, and not to be missed. This film also features my all time favorite Bond girl, Kissy Suzuki, who is so lovable, charming and radiant throughout the film. The special features are good as always, and the Sound and picture quality are excellent. One last thing: this film has the look and feel of something out of the 80's and even the 90's; it was way ahead of its time.",1491264000,2,1277,4.461538461538462
413435,1,630202028X,"1967's You only live twice.  Bond in the Asian theater.  This was Connery's fifth turn as Bond and almost his last.  By this movie he had had his fill of the role of Bond but more so his relationship with franchise producers Harry Saltzman and Cubbi Broccoli.  If Asian is your persuasion then you hit the jackpot with this Bond filmed on location in Japan.  Mie Hama, Akiko Wakabayashi and Tsai Chin fill the bill for Bond cuties in an oriental flavor.  Donald Pleasence plays Blofeld the evil mastermind who is going to start a war between America and Russia by snatching their spacecraft right out of orbit and letting them think the other one is doing it.  America and Russia were  in a big space race in the mid sixties with the moon landing not happening for another two years hence the theme of this movie.  The series is definitely on the downhill slide by this time, at one point Bond is even offered a martini ""stirred"", really...  Ken Adams designs his usual trademark huge elaborate set complete with monorail.  Apparently Bond was hugely popular in Japan in the sixties and the shooting locations were mobbed by fans to the point where Connery couldn't stand it.  This isn't the worst of the Connery Bonds that would be Diamonds are Forever in 1971, that was far and away the worst of Connery's appearances as Bond.  Lastly, Bond movies usually have very popular artists of the time do the theme song of the movie and this was no exception.  Nancy Sinatra's (yes Frank's daughter) rendition of you only live twice is almost hypnotic, once you hear it you'll be humming it all day.  All in all it is what it is, take it or leave it.",1489795200,,1644,4.52542372881356

413509,4,630202028X,"You Only Live Twice features the second best overall score to only Goldfinger, as well as one of the great theme songs performed by the velvet voiced Nancy Sinatra. This is really Sean Connery's last great James Bond movie, it is something of an archetypical James Bond movie representing the end of the first era of Bond. Not a masterpiece like Goldfinger, but not a disappointment like Diamonds are Forever.

This is the first time we actually get to see Blofeld, though he is alluded to in the previous films, this is also the best incarnation of the character in the franchise with Donald Pleasance playing an ideal Bond villain. Because the movie mostly takes place in Japan, the Bond girl and car (a Toyota 2000 GT) aren't exactly what we are used to, but go together well enough to fit with the story.

If you've seen Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, you know that this James Bond movie influenced it more than any other. From the underground lair, to the fleets of henchman, the bald depiction of Blofeld, the sequences in space and many more. In my mind I will look at this film as more or less the end of the Connery Bond era and thus the end of a great thing.

The movie boasts several distinctions. Theres a nifty helicopter sequence, involving an aerial gun battle between four conventional copters and a tiny but fast gyrocopter nicknamed Little Nellie. Theres Ken Adams gigantic set depicting a secret launch facility, which is supposed to be located inside a volcano. Theres gorgeous cinematography by the great Freddie Young, who shot Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago (see both elsewhere). And theres yet another beautiful, Asian-themed score by John Barry. I would rank it a close third behind Goldfinger and From Russia with Love as among the best of the series with Connery. My only quibble is the movie asks you to suspend quite a bit of disbelief where Bonds gadgets are concerned, because they seem to turn up out of thin air at the most opportune times (such as a safe-cracking device, rather large suction cups, and a special pack of cigarettes that seem to have survived an underwater swim unscathed). Also, the bad guys seem to have no trouble at all tracking him down wherever he goes. Theme song honors this time went to Nancy Sinatra.",1463788800,6,1319,4.9192825112107625

The Cold War was at its peak, ballistic missiles had been installed 90 miles off the coast of Florida, the President of the United States had been assassinated. At the same time, there was a fascination with the Orient because jet travel was just dawning for the masses. In the mid-1960's, only one in five Americans had ever flown on an airplane, and certainly not all the way to Japan. People knew about Japan what they learned by touring the Japanese pavilion at Expo '67, meant to show the way of life in present-day Japan. So, yeah, the movie is over the top stupid in parts. And, yeah, Sean Connery looks dopey as a Japanese man and looks like he has ants in his pants and would like to be anywhere else during the Japanese marriage sequence.

You Only Live Twice on the heels of Thunderball was an excellent film.  Though it may seem a little bit campy by today's standards, I always enjoy watching this movie.  There never seems to be a dull moment and the plot transitions smoothly keeping up the tension and suspense.  This was the first Bond movie where we get to see Bond use a fake death opening scene to go undercover and I think it really helped the film.  We finally get to see Blofeld played by Donald Pleasence.  I thought he made a pretty decent head villain number 1.  Sure they could have cast someone more menacing or more powerful for the role but I think he pulled it off nicely.  Every Connery James Bond film kept getting better and better and it is a little sad Sean came to dislike the role so much.  The little Nellie scenes are great and very thrilling.  You Only Live Twice is definitely one of the best Bond films and should be near the top of the 20 or so 007 films made to date.  I think The Spy Who Loved Me kind of recycled the plot of this film only using nuclear submarines instead of spacecraft out in orbit.  Both movies work and are great fun to watch.",1448323200,,1252,4.170833333333333

Upon landing in Tokyo, Bond teams up with the Japanese secret service and a small army of deadly ninjas (yes, NINJAS!) to track down the source of the signal of the hijacking vessel, and take down what turns out to be an old enemy organization determined (as always) to control the world.  Cool gadgets, over-the-top chase scenes and action sequences, and the usual political incorrectness of the Bond women featured here make for (if you can ignore that last one, it being a sign of the times and the genre) one of the more entertaining, genuinely fun (in a videogame sort of way) of all Bond's adventures.  ****1/2",1423267200,,822,4.694444444444445

414135,5,630202028X,"YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE is quite an interesting and highly entertaining James Bond film.

YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE containes elements of espionage, action, thrills, adventure and science fiction. Looking back it somehow worked loosely when put together yet till this day I can not determine what the cohesive element was. Looking at it closely the film is a real dichotomy of styles.

The first hour is excellently filmed and works very well. We get to see James Bond the spy, working with recognition codes, breaking into safes, going under cover and the like. There is an excellently choreographed fight scene between Bond and a sumo wrestler. This is also the first time he developed a good working relationship with a fellow intelligence head, Tiger Tanaka, similar to that of Kerim Bey in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. We also see that ""M"" has absolute confidence in his man. ""This is the big one,"" he tells Bond knowing that 007 is the only one capable of pulling off this assignment. There is also quite a bit of very witty dialog in the first hour of this film. In the first hour the pace is deliberate, but never boring and always enticing and entertaining. It ends with Bond flying ""Little Nellie,"" delivered by ""Q,"" into an aerial dogfight with four helicopters.

As it moves into the second hour more of the science fiction and fantasy elements start to take center stage. The film starts to look untidy and meanders along till it gets to the excellently filmed battle between Tanaka's ninjas and Blofeld's private army in his Volcano lair. It's not a bad Bond film, but it should have been a lot better. I think the culprit was the editing. Russian and American manned space capsules were being snatched out of orbit by an ""intruder missile."" Bond had to find the location and the identity of those responsible before World War III breaks out.

The filmmakers decided not to surprise us at the end of the film, but instead show us, not Bond, that this ""intruder missile"" is in fact owned by SPECTRE and is being launched from Blofeld's Volcano lair in Japan. That comes a little past the hour mark. That being the case there was a good opportunity to develop suspense, as Bond has to locate the launch site. When Bond finally does find the volcano he has very little reaction to his discovery. He in fact seems to have come prepared with suction cup kneepads, which he uses to climb upside down and into the volcano. Tanaka shows up with his men, the battle ensues and Bond saves the day. It just could have been done much better considering how well the first half of the film was handled. The massive sets designed by Ken Adam were highly innovative and stylized and are probably the best of the entire series. M's office aboard the submarine, M-1, was also pretty innovative incorporating furniture and decorations from his office from the Ministry of Defense back in London.

John Barry wrote a brilliant score. His music for the ""Capsule in Space"" was eerily ominous. He also incorporated sections of the ""James Bond Theme"" very effectively subsequent to Henderson's death and the fight in Osato's office. Barry's ""Mountains and Sunset"" went beautifully with Freddie Young's Cinematography. This and his score for ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE were the last to contain his best action pieces for the series. These were little snippets here and there written to give the action a little more punch.

I thought Sean Connery gave some his best performances as James Bond in this film. Bond's scene with Henderson was very good. His repartee with Moneypenney was one of his best. Sean Connery did return as James Bond in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, but one era had already ended with ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and a new one would begin with his return.

YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE is one of most visually impressive films of the series.",1421452800,,3829,4.731634182908546

414198,5,630202028X,"Very campy in some respects, given the dated visual and audio special effects. Overlook the mysterious camera in the sky in various scenes which show the action occurring. And, the chase scene with the Toyota sports car is certainly not the best in any film. However, this is looking at this and other 60's Bond films with an eye from today's world. The special effects used were very good for the day. The money spent on this film was astounding considering the time period. To spend over $1M on the crater HQ set was almost unheard of.

Kudos to the production team for continuing to produce what has become a fantastic series of films. Without the work done on this film with Sean Connery, the Bond films would have become a passing fancy and would have likely been relegated to the archives, hardly viewed by the public. Instead, this film became the one in which all of the rest of the Bond films used as the basis for so many twists and turns and look and feel. I thoroughly enjoy all Bond films, especially the first half dozen. All actors who portrayed Bond were top drawer, but Connery is the most roguish and believable as 007. You continue to keep wondering when Miss Moneypenny will get her wish. And yet, you know that will never occur.

414249,3,630202028X,"YOLT is where the franchise took a turn in direction, introducing more action and campier elements but it wasn't nearly as outrageous as the franchise would become in it's later years such as Moonraker or Die Another Day. Sean Connery was tired of playing Bond and gives a rather lazy performance even though I agree as well as many others that he's the best Bond still. Donald Pleasance is a good actor and portrays Blofeld well but I didn't like the inhuman, ultra-sinister direction they took him who came off more humorous than threatening. Telly Savalas wasn't perfect as Blofeld who had a more henchman-like portrayal than a mastermind and Charles Gray had his flaws from cross-dressing to having a more quirky portrayal but Savalas seemed believable and threatening while Gray at least acted human who I thought actually played the best Blofeld but in one of the weaker entries. Aside from many flaws in YOLT, there are some real classic Bond moments from Bond running into Blofeld face to face for the first time as well as the iconic fight scene in the volcano. James Bond fakes his death in the beginning, there are some of the best locations of any installment taking place in Japan, the action is great throughout and the higher budget helps bring the film out from being just another Bond film and makes up for the lazy performance of Connery. There's all kinds of memorable action scenes, chase scenes and moments but bigger isn't always better. Plot is a little out there but it's one of the better campy entries since it was earlier as did something different for the series. Blofeld is hijacking space ships and hiding out in Japan which his headquarters are disguised as a volcano. After a spaceship had been hijacked alongside astronauts being abducted, Bond fakes his death and is sent to Japan undercover to investigate. YOLT is a film which I've known Bond fans that love it as far as putting it as their favorite to others hating to point of putting it at the bottom or near the bottom. While I consider it the weakest of Connery's official films and the weakest of the '60s Bond films by far, it's not a bad film at all and there are certainly worse entries in the series. YOLT might be quite a letdown after 4 classic Bonds in a row and it's tone is different for sure but there's just enough classic Bond ingredients to keep your interest and is a entertaining film altogether.",1412985600,,2403,4.656470588235294

414383,5,630202028X,"...after 1965's ""Thunderball"".

""You Only Live Twice"" (1967) takes agent 007 to Japan where he seeks the secret SPECTRE installation responsible for literally stealing space capsules and threatening war between the USA and USSR. With the help of some Japanese agents, Bond finds the base...on a remote island.

This 5th installment in the franchise upped the ante with the action & spy-stuff and is more compelling than previous ones. Speaking of the spy aspects, they're often over-the-top here to the point of being cartoony. Another reviewer criticized the film in this regard -- pointing out that it was this film more than any other that gave the Austin Powers movies the most material to spoof -- and he was right. One scene, for instance, brought to memory that Gilligan's Island episode where Gilligan had a dream of being Agent 014 (remember the soup spoon?). No wonder the franchise got goofy in the 70s -- it was the only logical place to go.

Disregarding the ""Yeah, right"" spy shenanigans, ""You Only Live Twice"" has everything you'd want in a Bond picture -- the action, intrigue, gadgets, beautiful women, spectacular locations and larger-than-life villains. The story is interesting enough that it keeps you interested and even builds suspense as the film goes from one action scene to another, culminating in the explosive climax. It was understandably a huge hit in 1967.

There's not much else to say, except that the film runs 117 minutes and was shot in Japan.

414385,3,630202028X,"I don't even know where to start here.  This film is hilarious, which isn't the intention and yet the cheeky camp quality of the Bond series has been somewhat of an endearing trait.  Still, there is so much going on here that it becomes increasingly difficult to take it seriously, like at all.  In fact, of all the Bond films I've seen (and I really haven't seen many), this one is the closest I've seen to reflecting the inspirations for Mike Myers massively successful `Austin Powers' series.

Pretty much everything but the kitchen sink is thrown at us.  We have samurais, astronauts, world war, assisted bathing, creepy cat men, Bond in yellow-face (which basically consists of a wig and some arched eyebrows), spaceship eating spacecrafts, giant magnets used to dump cars in the ocean, double crosses, double-double crosses and girls in their underwear, not to mention sake, at the perfect temperature.

Oh yeah, and the last ten minutes is pretty much a bunch of stuff blowing up.

The problem is not in all the visual fun, because it kind of works here, but the fact that the plot is so convoluted and thin.  Nothing really feels engaging, despite being so over-the-top.  I was bored stiff through most of it, to the point where even the action felt somewhat redundant and ineffective.  I applaud them for `going there', but I just wish that Roald Dahl, who adapted this from Ian Flemmings' novel, would have been cleverer and more insightful in his scripting.

This is the forth in the series for Connery.

The bad guys are really bad.
The good guys - may or may not be - really good. So many die so fast - it's hard to tell.
Most if not all of James' girl friends die.
Usually, the supreme villain and one uber henchman has to die.

The gadgets are neat, the plot is preposterous, the hero's survive-ability incredible.
Even in it's day, it was difficult to tell whether it was a Spy-Thriller or a Comedy.

If you are into do-it-yourself resurrection, this is the movie for you.
But, 007 dies a bunch of times in various plots - So, really he gets to live a lot more than twice.
Still, one has difficulty with a rather tall, beefy, anglo - passing himself off as Japanese.
Connery attempts to master the slouch, and walk short.. - but, it just doesn't work.
There is some neat auto-gyro footage.
Some how the better equipped helicopters with a 4 to ratio to 007 are no match for an un-armored, under powered, over ladened auto gyro... Turns out, the trick is getting them to stand still - in order to be shot... script control can be a marvelous thing.

Oh, - and, SPECTRE is trying to start a full scale nuclear war between the US and Russia.
They do this with a space capsule gobbling Super Capsule, that is single stage to orbit. It can grab another object. Re-enter with it. And, land with it (single stage) tail first.
If SPECTRE could do that - they wouldn't need to be a criminal organization.
The federal government would hire them as their space sub-contractors.
SPECTRE demonstrates a orbital capability that doesn't exist today.
Plus, the did it in less time than either the Americans and Russians - and, without any money.
Other than that - it's totally believable.

Oh, and - who knew that Venetian blinds could be an impregnable shield?

Connery seems to be having fun.
The acting is limited by the script.
The special effects, sets, stunts were state of the art for the day.
If you are a 007 fan, it all works.",1377820800,,2075,4.4162303664921465

414465,4,630202028X,"The fifth Bond film was billed as Sean Connery's last James Bond film.  Connery cited a desire to make different films as the main reason.

The film itself features a blander opening sequence that is obviously a ruse - Bond's death.  Agent 007 fakes his death in order to go after whoever has been hi-jacking space capsules in orbit around the Earth.  All monitoring evidence points to the Sea of Japan where an unknown spaceship came down but no trace is found.  Bond travels to Japan and partners with Tiger Tanaka (Tetsuro Tamba voiced by Robert Rietty), head of the Japanese secret service, Tiger's ninja warrior force and two female agents, Aki (Akiko Wakabayashi) and Kissy (Mie Hama) to identify and stop the culprits before nuclear war is provoked between Russia and the USA.  Interestingly, Ms. Hama's inability to speak enough English cost her the role played of Aki.  Her voice was dubbed. Bernard Lee, Desmond Llewelyn and Lois Maxwell return as Bond's team.  Charles Gray plays the suave Japan contact, Henderson. Q introduces the little gyro-copter that saves Bond in a fight against SPECTRE helicopters.  Among the hi-lights are the dumping of a car into the ocean, a great helicopter battle scene, the attack on Ernst Stavros Blofeld (SPECTRE No. 1) and his volcano hideout.  The villains of Blofeld (Donald Pleasance), Osato (Teru Shimada),and Helga Brandt (Karin Dor) carry on the tradition of Bond villains.  Tiger Tanaka's ninja school and HQ was featured here and inspired Bond producers and screenwriters to do the same for MI-6 and Q a few films later in Live And Let Die. The extravagant SPECTRE base was the largest ever built and it looks magnificent.  One of the letdowns was the short fight with Blofeld's bodyguard, Schultz (Ronald Rich) who gets thrown into a pool of piranhas.  In the end, peace is restored and Bond gets the girl.  This was a good film for Connery to take a hiatus from the series.

A side note for Bond fanatics: Shane Rimmer(a Dr. Who regular) makes his first Bond appearance here as the Hawai Radio Operator.  He will pop up in different roles in other Bond movies.",1376006400,,2117,4.822714681440443

414669,5,630202028X,"While I think objectively not the best Bond film, You Only Live Twice is my all-time selfish and personal favorite.

Why?

- Bond dies...sort of
- Fantastic title song and artistic Binder credit sequence
- Snappy Roald Dahl script with fantastic pacing
- Donald Pleasance is the best Blowfeld
- Authentic and engaging location almost entirely set in Japan
- Connery at his most confident (He looked pretty bored in Diamonds are Forever)
- Freddy Young's cinematography (He shot Lawrence of Arabia among others)
- I love the title

Sure there's weak spots.  Brief case helicopter? The 'plastic surgery' bit is pretty jokey and the finale seems to have been ripped off later by George Lucas for the final action sequence in Return of the Jedi, but it's of little concern.  You Only Live Twice is such a fun and well-made Action/Adventure yarn, it holds up like the pyramids after all these years.

The Blu-Ray generally looks good.  There's an ever-present thin veneer of film grain which gives a sense of life to the picture, but occasionally comes off soft.  There is good detail, however, and the ridiculous process shots when a projector was used for a background Hitchcock style are the biggest standouts to date the movie, but that's true to source, not a fault in the transfer.  The sound is quite clear.  It lacks bass overall much like most movies made before the 80s, but the music score is quite well balanced.

Set in Japan, this film showed clearly that the horrors of the Pacific War were over. Japanese culture is really neat. Nancy Sinatra sings the main theme. It is probably my favorite Bond opening theme of all time. The action is awesome! I remember watching this when I was very young, about 40 years ago, and was just astounded at the big battle between ninjas and bad guys. Bond saves the day in this film. I did think the U.S. 'generals' that respond in the film were way overreactive.

Anyway, You Only Live Twice is a wonderful, action-packed film.",1352073600,,652,4.572649572649572
414673,5,630202028X,"You can tell when a movie has been influential because of imitation (""The Incredibles"")and parody (""Austin Powers"")40 plus years AFTER it was released. Although some elements are even less believable 45 years later (Bond passing as a Japanese fisherman? Really?)Roald Dahl's script and the sharp direction of Lewis Gilbert keep ""You Only Live Twice"" entertaining and the unexpected opening sequence where Bond is assassinated only to be resurrected later adds to the fantasy elements of the film.

Bond travels to Japan to find out who is behind snatching U.S. and Soviet spacecraft in an attempt to cause war between the two superpowers. To investigate this case which Bond believes Blofeld (Donald Pleasence) to be behind, he must appear to be dead so that his enemies won't expect him.

Production designer Ken Adams creates one of his most impressive sets, Dahl's script introduces key elements that will become part of every Bond film in the future (to one degree or another)and director Lewis Gilbert does a nice job setting up the action sequences creating one of the seminal Bond films. Although the Bond films would often go bigger (not much more than this admittedly), I don't think they ever got better. Gilbert is so confident directing the film that he even borrows the ""punch"" shot from Hitcock's ""Strangers on a Train"" and ""North by Northwest"" (where when our hero is hit it appears that WE are a nice use of point-of-view rarely used beyond Hitchcock's films).

In a nice touch Charles Gray who appears as Henderson here appears in ""Diamonds are Forever"" playing Blofeld (I do find it curious though that EON productions chose not to cast the same actor as Blofeld in more than one film although, at least in the case of ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", the character is played by the late bald actor Telly Savalas)in Connery's next-to-last appearance as Bond (his last would be, of course, in the ""Thunderball"" remake ""Never Say Never Again"").

The film was so successful that ""You Only Live Twice"" was used as a template for later Bond movies such as ""The Spy Who Loved Me"".

""You Only Live Twice"" receives a nice looking restoration from Lowry and a very nice HD transfer. The film has nice depth and detail. There are still a few flaws that crop up now and again (for example during a couple of shots of the volcano there's a noticeable line right in the middle of the frame)but, on the whole, ""You Only Live Twice"".

The sequences that tend to be soft and look the worse for wear are some of the composite shots used in the film which was unavoidable. This also includes the stock footage of the volano erupting at the conclusion of the film.

The DTS lossless audio sounds marvelous highlighting John Barry's marvelous and often melodic score.

The special features have largely been ported over from the previous DVD edition of the film. We get a commentary track that features director Lewis Gilbert (among others)combined with others from the production crew.

Unfortunately no deleted scenes survived for this Blu-ray edition (unlike ""Diamonds Are Forever"" for example).

We do get ""Welcome to Japan Mr. Bond"" a made for TV program to promote the film featuring Moneypenny discussing Bond's various adventures. It's a cool vintage extra for fans of the series and is presented in HD.

We also get excerpts from ""Whicker's World"" a BBC documentary we also get a brief behind-the-scenes glimpse at the locations narrated by production designer Ken Adam.

""Inside 'You Only Live Twice'"" is a well made documentary on the making of the movie. We also get a documentary on the opening titles created by the late Maurice Binder for the Bond films. The two short documentaries are presented in standard definition. We also get the storyboard sequence for the plane crash as well as a brief glimpse at the exotic locations used for the film hosted by Maude Adams.

Also included are theatrical trailers for the film, a TV ad, radio spots and ""Image Database"" which inclues various stills and promo shots for the film.

It's tough to name a favorite Connery Bond film but when it comes to sheer spectacle ""You Only Live Twice"" was the biggest and boldest of the Bond adventures with its stunning final assault on the volcano lair of Blofeld influencing an entire generation of Spy films. Although my favorite remains ""From Russia with Love"" followed by ""Goldfinger"", ""You Only Live Twice"" is certainly up there with those two films.",1351382400,3,4451,4.878145695364238
414674,5,630202028X,"While all Bond films have something I like, in this story of Bond investigating several U.S. and Russian space capsules that have been intercepted by a mysterious third party located in Japan, there is an action sequence that is so large and so exciting, that it has risen to the top of my favorites.  It is near the climax of the film, inside a hidden base in a volcano, which is one of the greatest sets you will ever see in a James Bond movie.  Dozens of ninjas stream down ropes to battle Blofeld's Chinese forces, while Bond tries to stop World War III from starting.

Picture quality is simply amazing!  They had restored it in high definition for for the DVD Ultimate Edition several years ago.  That was very impressive for the time, but now that we really get it in HD it just blows away the DVD!  No kidding, this does not look like it was filmed in the 1960s.  You've heard the joke that you can see the pores in HD.  Well, here, you really do.

Audio quality is exceptional.  A great film to crank up the volume.  Make sure your subwoofer is on.

The extras:  Let me tell you, these will keep you going for a very long time.  They have been ported over from the two-DVD Ultimate Edition, and they cover more than just the making of You Only Live Twice.  One of the best is a salute to the title sequences by Maurice Binder.  Another one I liked, but it was only excerpts, was a Whicker's World b&w TV documentary on the set, capturing a lot of the filming as it happened.  There is also a commentary with cast and crew.  It almost seems like the extras never end, and that is a very good thing.

Very highly recommended.",1351123200,,1632,4.2918032786885245
414675,5,630202028X,"I have been a fan of James Bond for years, and was very excited about the first blu-ray releses of the James Bond films, and for the most part they are spectacular, but then found out a handful of them were being held for future release. One of these being held was ""You Only Live Twice"" which is one of my favorite Sean Connery films as James Bond. Although I don't believe it is his very best Bond film, it is still very enjoyable and fun film to watch. By now Connery was deep into his role and played it beautifully tongue and cheek. But while he was filming this he decided he was getting tired of playing Bond and he stated this would be his final goround to his producer Albert Broccoli. The story has Bond going to Japan to find out who is sabotaging American and Russian space ships, and we see the debut of Ernst Blofeld here played by Donald Pleasance. I was so happy when they announced the final group of James Bond films would be released on Blu-Ray. As far as the quality goes, this movie looks in a word, ""Fantastic"". It trumps over the previous Dvd versions by hoops and bounds. It is in wide screen so there are black bars on top and bottom but this is normal. Picture is super sharp, and super clean, not a scratch or blemish to be seen. Colors are perfect, you can see every detail, it is like watching a new film. For a 45 year old film, this is absolutely beautiful to look at. The sound quality is spectacular as well, Dts. hd 5.1 surround sound is clear and enveloping. The music score also sounds wonderful. The Blu-ray has the same bonus features as the previous dvd, and unfortunately nothing really new there, but this is definitely worth the double dipping. Can't wait to see the other James Bond blu-rays that have just been released. I highly recommend this blu-ray.",1350950400,4,1797,4.383233532934132
414736,5,630202028X,"YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE is quite an interesting and highly entertaining James Bond film.

YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE contained elements of espionage, action, thrills, adventure and science fiction. Looking back it somehow worked loosely when put together yet till this day I can not determine what the cohesive element was. Looking at it closely the film is a real dichotomy of styles.

The first hour is excellently filmed and works very well. We get to see James Bond the spy, working with recognition codes, breaking into safes, going under cover and the like. There is an excellently choreographed fight scene between Bond and a sumo wrestler. This is also the first time he developed a good working relationship with a fellow intelligence head, Tiger Tanaka, similar to that of Kerim Bey in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. We also see that ""M"" has absolute confidence in his man. ""This is the big one,"" he tells Bond knowing that 007 is the only one capable of pulling off this assignment. There is also quite a bit of very witty dialog in the first hour of this film. In the first hour the pace is deliberate, but never boring and always enticing and entertaining. It ends with Bond flying ""Little Nellie,"" delivered by ""Q,"" into an aerial dogfight with four helicopters.

As it moves into the second hour more of the science fiction and fantasy elements start to take center stage. The film starts to look untidy and meanders along till it gets to the excellently filmed battle between Tanaka's ninjas and Blofeld's private army in his Volcano lair. It's not a bad Bond film, but it should have been a lot better. I think the culprit was the editing. Russian and American manned space capsules were being snatched out of orbit by an ""intruder missile."" Bond had to find the location and the identity of those responsible before World War III breaks out.

The filmmakers decided not to surprise us at the end of the film, but instead show us, not Bond, that this ""intruder missile"" is in fact owned by SPECTRE and is being launched from Blofeld's Volcano lair in Japan. That comes a little past the hour mark. That being the case there was a good opportunity to develop suspense, as Bond has to locate the launch site. When Bond finally does find the volcano he has very little reaction to his discovery. He in fact seems to have come prepared with suction cup kneepads, which he uses to climb upside down and into the volcano. Tanaka shows up with his men, the battle ensues and Bond saves the day. It just could have been done much better considering how well the first half of the film was handled. The massive sets designed by Ken Adam were highly innovative and stylized and are probably the best of the entire series. M's office aboard the submarine, M-1, was also pretty innovative incorporating furniture and decorations from his office from the Ministry of Defense back in London.

John Barry wrote a brilliant score. His music for the ""Capsule in Space"" was eerily ominous. He also incorporated sections of the ""James Bond Theme"" very effectively subsequent to Henderson's death and the fight in Osato's office. Barry's ""Mountains and Sunset"" went beautifully with Freddie Young's Cinematography. This and his score for ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE were the last to contain his best action pieces for the series. These were little snippets here and there written to give the action a little more punch.

I thought Sean Connery gave some his best performances as James Bond in this film. Bond's scene with Henderson was very good. His repartee with Moneypenney was one of his best. Sean Connery did return as James Bond in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER but one era had already ended with ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and a new one would begin with his return.",1348617600,,3751,4.736600306278714
414737,5,630202028X,"And that's sad to say, because this movie has so much potential. MI6 fakes Bond's death in the pre-title sequence, so that it's throw SPECTRE off the trail. But Bond can't rest, because missiles are being hijacked. Bond tracks them to Japan, with the help of Tanaka tiger. He goes after SPECTRE, but find Ernst Stavro bloffeld instead. Now, I do have to agree that a major problem in this movie, is that part of the plot. Is that in order for Bond to do his job, he has to become Japanese. And it's already been said before, they put some flesh colored make-up, and some eyeshadow. And called it good, boy those SPECTRE agents must be really stupid. Bond finds Bloffeld's hideout, a hollowed out volcano. And we get the huge battle at the end, with Bloffeld almost killing bond in the end. but alas, he escaped from Bond, threw a secret switch and blew up the volcano. Bond and his Japanese wife, who was an agent of Tiger's, barely escape. An overall good Bond movie, yes it is alittle dated. But not bad, and sadly, Connery would leave the series after this movie. You can tell he's bored with the role in this movie, Connery would came back for one last official bond movie, two films after this one. Annnnnnnd, he should have stayed away, but you only live twice is a good Bond movie.",1348012800,,1288,4.438818565400844
414738,5,630202028X,"Now I know that a lot of critics and fans have criticized this movie over the years, but I steadfastly maintain that it is my favorite. Roald Dahl's screenplay is clever, fantastical without going over the top, and builds steadily to a great climax. It is a parade of tongue-in-cheek fun from beginning to end. The sets reached new heights (who can forget Blofeld's lair inside a hollowed out volcano?). John Barry's score is among his best (On Her Majesty's Secret Service had the best score, and the movie was the best of the non-Connery films). And Connery (still the only actor who truly was James Bond) serves up the appropriate level of droll, ironic detachment throughout. Just enjoy this one.

Sean Connery remains convincing as the suave ladies' man with a cool head under pressure, but it's hard not to snicker a little when he climbs aboard a tiny yellow toy helicopter and proceeds to mow down a fleet of full-sized enemy choppers with ease. Our hero is also beginning to show his advanced age during the infrequent fight scenes around the middle of the picture, with nameless henchmen constantly going out of their way to stand in the way of his slow, looping thrown fists.

414846,3,630202028X,"I am big James Bond fan.  I love From Russia With Love, Goldfinger and Diamonds Are Forever.  Dr. No and Thunderball, while not as strong to me, still bring that 007 zest.  This one however is a dud. The plot drags, the characters look bored and are uninteresting.  Donald Pleasance as world destructor du jour Blofeld overplays his part.  Bond going Japanese is just damn offensive.  I actually enjoy Kissy Suzuki though.  She relates well to Bond.  Karen Dorr as Helga Brandt is just a rehash of Fiona Volpe's character in Thunderball, albeit not as good either.  This movie has some cool set pieces like the Volcano layer, magnificently designed by Ken Adam. At the end of the day, it still is a James Bond movie from the 60's starring Sean Connery, which is still a joy to watch.  So I give it 2 stars, maybe even 2 1/2, but the movie just fails on so many levels that I have to call it out as one of the weaker of the series.  See this if you've never seen a James Bond movie and want a laugh for how much the Austin Powers series borrowed from this movie.",1274227200,3,1061,4.308080808080808

414848,3,630202028X,"James Bond 5 arrives a year later than it's predecessors, and from then on Bond films would start coming out every two years. By 1967 Bondmania had  peaked and Sean Connery had run out of steam in the part. Though even a more lacklustre performance in this entry is still a standout. It's a Bond film that gets lost amongst others, not a classic but not as bad as some later entries. Lewis Gilbert slips into the director's chair and whisks us off to Japan for all the main action. It's the first time near the whole story was confined to one location and the first time the screenplay bears little resemblance to the original Fleming novel, adapted by author Roald Dahl.

Megalomaniacal organization Spectre are this time trying their best to get world powers Russia and the States to have a nuclear war by stealing their each countries orbiting space shuttles with their own ""big momma"" space capsule and ensuring it looks like the opposing countries are doing it to each other. The opening pre-credits mini adventure is slow paced for once and ends abruptly with Bond's supposed execution. Connery decided to quit the role while filming, probably a wise move but imagine what he could have done in On Her Majesties Secret Service, which was originally the producers first choice to make until locations proved unavailable and You Only Live twice was pushed forward instead.

The formula is starting to look tired and more gadget laden down to his latest gyro copter ""little Nellie' which sees gadget man Q dragged out into the field again. Bond's faked death allows him to go undercover and get ever closer to the bad guys, tracking them down to Tokyo via his contacts that include the striking Aki, played by Akiko Wakabayashi, Tetsuro Tampa as ""Tiger"" Tanaka - the head of the Japanese secret service and Mie Hama as Kissy Suzuki who while good, sort of rather pointlessly replaces the more interesting character of Aki for the last half hour of the story. They all carry out a rather convoluted and accidental investigation to expose the Spectre agents in a Japanese corporation and track them to the main Spectre lair for the inevitable meeting and showdown with the big Spectre boss Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Played with convincing malevolence, baldness and a massive facial scar by Donald Pleasance. He's the best version of Blofeld and the blueprint for Dr. Evil thirty years later. Pity his other henchmen and women are so colorless in this story.

The film has a great set up and action pieces in the early half but seems to wander a bit until we get the great scenes of Bond finally meeting Blofeld in his extinct volcano headquarters. It just takes a while to reach them and then the confrontations too short! Some other bits verge on the ridiculous, like the totally unconvincing Japanese fisherman disguise the secret service give Connery making him blend in with the locals less well than an elephant at a lizards only Cabaret Club. The action set pieces take on an epic scale under Lewis' direction setting a new standard for Bond films, especially the final battle in Spectre's HQ between Spectre forces and a ninja army. The Ken Adam designed sets are equally epic in scale. Still the feel of Japan is captured nicely throughout the picture and Nancy Sinatra provides a memorable voice to the John Barry Lyrics of the title song.

The restoration picture quality on the disc make the setting look far more distinctive and it was great to hear all the extra noise in the crowd and battle scenes thanks to the 5.1 Surround. The extras have been bulked from the original release, on top of the brilliant `making of"" documentary we also get a Whickers World segment promoting the film around the time of release, Ken Adams location scouting footage showing a far more relaxed Connery having some fun and a well done special called `Welcome to Japan Mr. Bond' Where Moneypenny and Q present some clips of previous films in specially shot scenes. The film series had now headed firmly into spy fantasy becoming bigger and more outlandish to be seen amongst the many movie and T.V imitators. Connery's regular reign as the titular spy had come to an end, not soon enough for him but who could replace him?",1264809600,,4214,4.751366120218579

414851,4,630202028X,"Sean Connery's You Only Live Twice, the first Ian Fleming adaptation that really used just the title and not much more -- completely different from the novel.

Basically, space capsules from the USA and USSR are being snatched by an evil guy played by Donald Pleasance (see the Austin Powers parody on this guy, Dr. Evil) as he pets his pet Persian and plots the demise of the USA and USSR.  His clients want them to destroy each other then pick up the pieces.

But they did not have a plan for Bond.  James Bond.

Bond goes through Asian women (which actresses, several look like Caucasian women with eye make-up), baby helicopters, Moneypenny's flirting and even fakes his own death.

Despite the Bond girls, the artful music, and the shooting and chase scenes (with helicopters no less), a bit above average Bond flick, but no means as well made as Dr. No or Goldfinger..

Recommended for a rental.

Bond movies continued to offer the best action / adventure plots. The James Bond movies surfaced a world of espionage, gadgets, secret weapons, beautiful women and amazing cars. In this movie in particular, the helicopter used by Bond, named ""Little Nellie,"" was a dream come true for many fans who were always expecting leading edge technology to be displayed during the film.

Sean Connery continued to enchant audiences the world over, creating an image so powerful that still to today, it is debated that he offered the best Bond character.

The movie ""You only live twice"" brings us a song interpretation by Nancy Sinatra who had achieved great success in Europe and Japan during the early part of the 60s. The fifth Bond movie took an interesting twist as it was filmed in Japan. The volcano set used by Blofeld is amazing, the submarine settings excellent and the authentic Japanese scenes a fascinating way to learn about Japanese culture.

The plot of You only live twice takes Bond to Japan after the disappearance of American and Russian aircraft out in orbit. The plot takes place during the Cold War and soon both superpowers blame each other for the space mishaps. Bond is sent to investigate who the perpetrators really are and he encounters the head of SPECTRE, Ernst Stavro Blofeld face to face.

SPECTRE is working for an Asian country to get the US to fight with Russia, but Bond saves the day. Great action, superb scenery and if you like Japan, this movie is for you. Don't miss it!",1250553600,,1524,4.757575757575758

And views of major volcanoes in Kyushu including Aso and Sakurajima. When HIMEJI castle popped up from screen I could not contain my chuckles. It is indeed a fitting place for modern ninjas...

Sean Connery is one of the first western actors (excluding Japanese Americans) who lived a life as a Japanese in non-Japanese dramas. Naturally when TV mini-series Shogun was to be produced the top candidate for English pilot Blackthorne was Sean. I suspect Bond strictly followed a Japanese agent Tanaka's advice to become a real Japanese though. Could have used more subtitles for local language and let Bond show his achievement of language skill courses in Cambridge.

On the whole really enjoyable both in plot and actions.

Verdict: Neatly describing good old Japan with the exception of Ninja.
Rating: 90 out of 100. James Bond being a Japanese not that convincing enough.
Recommended for Ninja movies and action movies fans as well as Bond movie fans.",1243123200,4,1545,5.538135593220339
414916,5,630202028X,"You Only Live Twice is a Bond film only Connery could have pulled off without the film falling into the lowest pits of camp.  In a movie that includes spaceship eating spaceships, a miniature attack helicopter, a man-eating piranha tank, rocket-bullet firing guns, and pistol toting ninjas; this is a case where only Sean Connery's charm could save a film from being dominated by its cheese...Even when he's wearing poor make-up to make him ""Japanese.""

The film begins with James Bond's untimely death, but don't fall for that trap!  That clever Agent 007 has faked his own death and funeral at sea so as to pull away from the evil SPECTRE organization, which is now operating out of Japan.  What could they do in Japan?  How about attack American and Soviet spacecrafts and send to Cold War in to an all out nuclear war between The United States and Soviet Union?  That sounds evil enough for one movie!

Since they now believe Bond to be dead he is able to infiltrate their infrastructure and discover their plans for World War III.  With the help of Tiger Tanaka (head of Japanese Special Forces), his army of modern ninjas, and the beautiful Aki, Bond is set to take down this sinister plot.

Of course this time SPECTRE isn't holding any punches, for their faceless leader, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, is in Japan personally overseeing this operation (a great performance by Donald Pleasance).  The criminal mastermind is determined to eliminate his pesky foe once and for all.  Whether it be by submerging the smooth talking agent in a manmade lake filled with flesh-eating piranhas, poison taken in through the mouth, or a simple shot to the head.

This entire film is built on a series of elaborate actions sequences, including two stand-out scenes in which Bond engages multiple SPECTRE helicopters with ""Little Nellie"" (the newest gift from Q) and a massive firefight between Tiger Tonaka's modern ninjas and the forces of SPECTRE in their hollowed out volcano lair.

If you haven't noticed by this brief summary You Only Live Twice could very well could have been the one to set the foundation for the camp-filled Bond films of the 1970s.  The exotic locations and over the top ideas are things that would be exaggerated and expanded upon in Diamonds Are Forever (Connery's last film) and all throughout the Roger Moore era of the character.

So for these reasons You Only Live Twice is probably Sean Connery's most enjoyably fun entry in his run as the character.",1238457600,5,2470,4.819905213270142

414918,3,630202028X,"Sean Connery makes his fifth appearance as James Bond in You Only Live Twice (1967).

Filmed in the midst of the Cold War, the plot revolves around several American and Soviet spacecrafts that have disappeared after being swallowed by a mysterious ""unidentified flying object"". It turns out that the perpetrator of the disappearances is (predictably) SPECTRE led by Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Donald Pleasance), and the goal is to start a full-blown war between the USA and the Soviet Union. MI6 tracks the mysterious spacecraft to Japan and sends James Bond to get the job done. When Bond arrives, he is assisted by fellow MI6 agent Dikko Henderson (Charles Gray, who would later play Blofeld in Diamonds are Forever), as well as the head of the Japanese Secret Service ""Tiger"" Tanaka (Tetsuro Tamba) and his assistant Aki (Akiko Wakabayashi). 007 goes undercover and pretends to get married to a Japanese girl named Kissy Suzuki (Mie Hama) on the island where SPECTRE's headquarters are located inside the crater of an extinct volcano.

Ian Fleming's original storyline was discarded. All that was kept was the title, setting, and the main characters. It's different but still entertaining enough. The screenplay was written by the childrens' book author Roald Dahl, who handles it just fine. You Only Live Twice is also famous for being the first film to reveal Blofeld's face which is grotesquely deformed and inspired Dr. Evil from Austin Powers. The gadgets get a bit over-the-top in this film. The yellow ""Little Nellie"" gyrocopter is weird and I can't help but think that Sean Connery looks extremely silly in the helicopter fight scene.

Overall, not the best Bond film ever. It can be pretty silly, but is still worth watching at least once.",1236643200,,1746,5.0137931034482754

Here, an accident happens in space which pushes Earth closer and closer to World War III, and now, James Bond is sent to Japan to investigate, when all of a sudden, he stumbles upon a Japanese space base, which plans to launch a satellite and instigate global warfare. Truly this is a great film and my favorite Connery 007 portrayal, it was also his last before the decent-at-best ""Diamonds are Forever"".

And aside from that, this is the DVD to get! I picked it up for cheap at HMV (about $10) and who ever knew an amazing transfer would come for a cheap price. It's been restored frame-by-frame, so the picture looks beautiful. Watching it on an HDTV is like watching it at the theater for the first time, and I'm sure it looks just as great as it did back in 1967 (I wasn't alive back then but OK :P). The sound is amazing, in fact it is the best Bond movie for Surround Sound! Great use of the back speakers, and it sounds like a movie that just got released today. It really is that amazing.

There are no special features, aside from commentary. But other than that, this doesn't need special features, having the film on DVD with this amazing picture and sound quality is the equivalent of getting an awesome love-it-forever birthday present.

Gadget and gimmick ladden, it takes the bigger and better formula to the nth degree.  Even when looking overweight and bored, Sean Connery still has more screen presence than Roger Moore on his best day.  Donald Pleasance as Blofeld was a substitute for a Czech actor who looked more like Santa Claus than the evil leader of SPECTRE. (One of his men, Burt Kwong, is the same guy who played the Chinese scientist in GOLDFINGER and Sellers sidekick Kato in the Pink Panther films.)  Look for others from previous and future Bonds like Shane Rimmer and Ed Bishop.  Only significent new extra is ""Welcome to Japan, Mr. Bond"".

414922,3,630202028X,"This is the first of the many bond movies that would take a huge 360 turn in style. Whereas the 4 preceding bond movies had an inclinator towards more plausible plots, this one and future bond movies relied more on extravagant plots. ""You Only Live Twice"" is not a bad 007 movie, but it is in fact much weaker than the previous ones.

The main issue with you only live twice is the plot. S.P.E.C.T.R.E was introduced first as a menacing threat to the world, and the organization seemed believable and plausible. But as we get into the following movies it begins to show a more fantasy level of the organization. In From Russia With Love, Blofeld had the presence of a threat, and he seemed like a villain with class, and measured every precaution..And he had hair. in thunderball too he was still presented in the exact same manner...with hair; then out of nowhere here in this one he is short, stocky, annoying, makes stupid mistakes, his voice is different..And he is completely bald...wtf??!!

Also Sean Connery plays the part with very little enthusiasm, he looks very aged for a 37 year old; also he gained some weight in this one, and his charisma is somewhat gone. It all seems as if Connery said ""I'm tired with bond lets get over with it and give me my check"" and the effects are much weaker too, compared to Thunderball and the others it looks as if they placed little effort.

The plot here is very fantasy like, Bond fakes his death to fool S.P.E.C.T.R.E and to keep enemies away from him. He is sent by M to investigate why an American spacecraft was hijacked from orbit by a rogue craft. Bond has to investigate quickly before countries start blaming each other and things escalate to world war III. Bonds investigation leads him to Japan were he meets Japanese secret service leader ""Tiger"" Tanaka. both learn that a company under the name of OSATO industries is delivering liquid oxygen, an oxidizer for rocket fuel; now they have to find who is this client, of course is no other than our beloved Blofeld, who unfortunately is presented in a disappointing manner, much like that of Dr. Evil. Anyhow, bond discovers later on that there is a secret hiding place for S.P.E.C.T.R.E, where Bond and his fellow Japanese intelligence have to find a way to get in and attack before Blofeld steals more rockets for ransom.

The movie does have some good qualities, such as bond training to become a ninja, seeing that the Japanese have gadgets as good as the MI:6, the last fight in the volcano is done nicely. The gadgets overall are decently brought out. The location and cinematography is amazing. But aside all this the plot is very tedious and overall disappointing. So is this the worse bond movie ever?...of course not, trust me A View To A Kill and Die Another Day are much much worse. This is not a HORRIBLE bond movie, just a weaker one compared to the first 4. Still definitely worth owning

It's difficult to believe that this movie is more than 40 years old (counting from the date of this review)!!

(Sir) Sean Connery made six EON (or ""official"") movies with him starring as James Bond.  They were: (1) Dr. No (1962) (2) From Russia with Love (1963) (3) Goldfinger (1964) (4) Thunderball (1965) (5) You Only Live Twice (1967) and (6) Diamonds are Forever (1971).

As you can see from the above list, this movie is the fifth spy film of the British Bond series.  As well, it is the fifth to star Connery as the fictional MI6 agent Commander James Bond (code number 007).

This movie is based on the 1964 novel of the same name as the movie by Ian Fleming (1908 to 1964).

Briefly, Bond is told to go to Japan after American and Russian spacecraft mysteriously disappear in orbit.  With each nation blaming the other amidst the Cold War, Bond travels secretly (he's thought to be dead) to a remote Japanese island is find out who is behind these spacecraft disappearances and comes face to face with Ernst Blofeld (Donald Pleasence), known as ""number one"" since he is head of SPECTRE (SPecial Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion).

This movie reveals the appearance of Blofeld who was previously a partially unseen character.

The title song is sung by Nancy Sinatra.

Connery brings his characteristic savoir fare to the role.  As well, there are beautiful Japanese Bond girls in this movie.

There are gadgets in this movie courtesy of Q.  The main gadget is a Wallis WA-116 Series 1 gyroplane (similar to a helicopter but smaller)  code named ""Little Nellie.""  Bond tell us that, ""She's a wonderful girl.""  You'll have to watch this movie to see why.

M and Miss Moneypenny also make an appearance.

This movie was filmed mainly in Japan and London, England.

Total box office for this movie was about one-hundred eleven million, six hundred thousand dollars.  In today's dollars, that's about seven-hundred and twenty million, four hundred thousand.

For Bond enthusiasts, they will notice Charles Gray in a small part as a British contact living in Japan.  He went on to play Blofeld in the next and last Bond movie starring Connery.  Also Burt Kwouk has a bit part in this movie.  He's the one that played ""Kato"" in the Pink Panther series starring Peter Sellers.

Personally, I don't understand why this movie gets such a bad rap.  In my opinion, it showed considerable imagination, especially in the last half.

I only had two minor problems with this movie.  First, Bond presumably unexpectedly encounters a  locked safe.  He just happens to have a safe cracking device on him to open it!  (It's amazing it wasn't broken since he has a gruelling fight just before he encountered the safe.)  Second, again unexpectedly, Bond has to climb down a very tall structure.  Again, he just happens to have suction cups on him to aid him in this task!!

The DVD (the one released in May, 2007) is flawless in picture and sound quality.  The picture has been digitally restored and I'm sure the picture is just as good (if not better!!) than when it was released over 40 years ago.  As well, there is one extra in the form of an audio commentary.

Finally, here is some information to consider.  This DVD is actually the first disc of the two-disc ""Ultimate Edition.""  Bond fanatics might want to purchase this two-disc Ultimate Edition since the second disc has ""the best collection of special features ever assembled for Bond.""  (Unfortunately, the Ultimate Edition is no longer available but it can be purchased second-hand).

In conclusion, this is the last serious James Bond movie starring Sean Connery.  Because of this, this movie is a must-see!!

414948,4,630202028X,"After James Bond (Sean Connery) has participated in faking his own murder in Hong Kong, to give him ""more elbow room"" in the words of his superior, M (Bernard Lee), he is dispatched to Japan to investigate the mysterious disappearance of both American and Soviet space crafts which threatens to spark World War III.

Working together with Japanese secret service leader Tiger Tanaka (Tetsuro Tamba), he meets beautiful Japanese agent Aki (Akiko Wakabayashi), who helps Bond through several close shaves.
Working with a Japanese Secret Service Ninja force, he locates the sabotage to the shadowy organization SPECTRE, led by the sinister Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Donald Pleasence).
After Aki is murdered by SPECTRE agents (She dies after ingesting poison dropped into the bed she shares with Bond), Bond teams up, in a faked marriage with the attractive Kissy Suzuki Mie Hama).
Together with the Ninja force they penetrate Blofeld's massive headquarters, hidden in a volcano, where the final battle ensues.
Before Blofeld tries to kill Bond, he reminds him ""You Only Live Twice"", referring to his earlier faked death.
The chemistry between Bond and the exquisite Aki is perfect, and in the scene where a marriage is proposed and Bond thinks it is Aki, Aki's face lights up.
No less stunning is Mie Hama as Kissy Suzuki, an expert swimmer and fighter, and one of the sexiest Bond girl ever.",1205798400,10,1385,5.048034934497816
414949,4,630202028X,"1967's ""You Only Live Twice"" was Sean Connery's fifth outing as James Bond.  It carries the Bond saga to the Far East, as 007 pursues his arch-nemesis Blofeld to a deadly conclusion.

The story opens with a pre-credits sequence in which Bond is seemingly assassinated (and nicely sets up the theme song ""You Only Live Twice"").  Bond, now undercover, is off to the Far East to stop a SPECTRE plot which aims to start a war between the U.S. and Russia by hijacking their spacecraft.  Bond will work closely with his Japanese counterparts, including one especially attractive female agent.  The SPECTRE headquarters will finally be located in an extinct volcano, setting the stage for a splashy finale featuring dozens of ninja warriors.

This movie is perhaps not quite as good as some of its precedessors.  Bond looks out of place in Japan, while a misfigured Donald Pleasence is a not-entirely-convincing Blofeld, while the special effects haven't aged particularly well.  However, it's all still a good show, and recommended to fans of the 007 franchise.",1205280000,,1055,5.022988505747127
414950,4,630202028X,"Faced with box-office rivalry from the spoof Casino Royale the same year, EON put aside their plans to follow Thunderball with OHMSS and pulled out all the stops to promise the biggest and best-paced Bond to date. While they failed to match the phenomenal success of Thunderball - still the biggest ticket seller in the series' history by a huge margin - this certainly is the best of the special effects show Bonds, and for many it's scarred, bald, Persian-cat stroking super-villain ensconced in his hollowed-out volcano lair plotting to start a world war is the quintessential Bond movie villain. Departing from Ian Fleming's novel in all but name and boasting a plot the producers were so taken with that they've used it at least twice since The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker, both also directed by Lewis Gilbert), but by 1967 the series was already beginning to feed off itself - the pre-title sequence where Bond is killed is more or less borrowed from From Russia With Love.

After years as an offscreen presence voiced by Eric Pohlman and Joseph Wiseman, S.P.E.C.T.R.E.'s Ernst Stavro Blofeld finally makes his first on-screen appearance in the form of Donald Pleasance (causing that awkward continuity problem in the subsequent OHMSS where he fails to recognise Bond), with Charles Gray preceding his turn in the role on the side of the angels as our man in Japan, getting his vodka from the doorman at the Russian embassy (""among OTHER things""). This time the villains work for a large Japanese industrial company to cash-in on the Connery films' popularity in the Japanese market while offering some colorful locations, but action, not scenery, is the order of the day here. The action scenes themselves are terrific and often imaginatively shot (as with the long overhead helicopter shot in the fight at Kobe Docks) and the production values are still the best of the entire series. Visually it is certainly the best looking of the series thanks to Freddie Young's incredible photography, while Ken Adams production design is superb and the lush score marked a real turning point for John Barry.

Roald Dahl's screenplay strangely discards Blofeld's garden of death (too downbeat said the producers) and omits Bond's Japanese counterpart Tanaka's background as an ex-Kamikaze pilot (too sensitive) but has just the right internal logic to justify its outrageous elements, as well as some neat humorous touches (such as Bond being constantly castigated for his smoking). Although many fans were critical of his approach - Dahl made little secret of his opinion that Bond was a 'resourceful but rather insensitive fellow' - he is more astute about the character than many writers in the series, bringing Bond's smug superiority to the fore in lines like ""You forget I took a First in Oriental languages at Cambridge.""

It's particularly disappointing that the 2-disc set only includes five minutes of the very entertaining and surprisingly comprehensive hour-long Whicker's World special on the making of the film, which revealed Connery's fondness for Custard Creams. We do get the glossier and less interesting 48-minute Welcome to Japan, Mr Bond (which makes an injoke of the fact that OHMSS had originally been scheduled to be made that year by having an unseen actress complain that she was supposed to be Mrs Bond) and Ken Adams' home movie footage, but there's not enough new to justify the `Ultimate Edition' tag here.",1202860800,,3437,5.036906854130053
414951,5,630202028X,"""You Only Live Twice"" seems to often go overlooked by many fans. To me it still ranks somewhat with the best of the early Connery reign. The films many attributes include outstanding action, spectacular sets and Sean Connery. Yes, Sean Connery (albeit slightly disenchanted with the role) still keeps us immersed in his ""serious"" approach to Bond. Granted, his disappointment with the producers was a major issue in what may seem, at times, to be an uneven performance but there are other factors to consider as well. Script, direction and editing (in this case, add a couple of wardrobe mistakes) also play an important part in almost any performance. It just so happens that this project, especially toward the end, was rushed to meet a deadline and, let's face it, Connery himself was just not as fit, groomed, or inspired as he was in his previous outings as Bond.

The major flaw with YOLT is that it is too long. This was also the case with ""Thunderball"". After the success of the first three installments, especially ""Goldfinger"", the producers had so much more money to play with that they wanted it all on the screen. The pacing of these two films suffers as a result. Whereas Connery's terrific performance in ""Thunderball"" helped that film immensely, YOLT, out of necessity, must rely on its sets and action to boost its entertainment value. A telltale snippet of dialogue is when Bond, having just experienced an array of awesome Ninja warriors, wryly asks Tanaka, ""What about ME ?""

Personally, I have long held the notion that the producers, were they so inclined,  could probably offer us superior versions of both ""You Only Live Twice"" and ""Thunderball"" by intelligently re-editing and deleting about 5 to 10 minutes of each film. The ""theft of the warheads"" and ""wedding"" scenes come to mind immediately.

Nevertheless, YOLT is a superior entry in the series. In addition to the aforementioned facts, it contains great cinematography work and yet another excellent music score by John Barry. It is, in many ways, the Bond version of ""Alice in Wonderland"" and is certainly far better than ANY of the Roger Moore films. By the way, this latest remastered version (the same as the Ultimate 2-disc package) is the one to get.",1202774400,8,2238,4.881578947368421
414952,5,630202028X,"You only live twice is one of the greatest installments in Connery's Bond run. It involves the (however temporary) death of 007, a massive criminal organization in a volcano, a breathtaking helicopter chase, a classic ninja vs. mercenary battle, and a classic musical score by John Barry to ice the cake. Connery is perfect (once again) as the suave, cold, yet incredibly likable and charming James Bond 007, and the villain is also excellent.
If you love Bond films, this one will be one of your favorites!",1201392000,5,507,4.839080459770115

414974,5,630202028X,"YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE is one of the best James Bond films of the series. Sean Connery's cool approach with great aplomb as 007 yet delivered with such conviction is a highlight of the series and Connery's tenure as James Bond. The photography is just beautiful and Ken Adam's more practical yet stylistic production designs meld flawlessly into this epic. John Barry's score not only came of age in THUNDERBALL but also continues to set the standard of what a James Bond score should sound like from here on out as demonstrated in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE. It is one of his best scores continuing to combine the essence of what defines James Bond the man with the aura of the larger than life world he inhabits. YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE is one of the definitive James Bond films combing action, outstanding sets and incredible drive.",1196467200,5,821,4.63013698630137
414975,3,630202028X,"You Only Live Twice has many things going for it: Two good heroines, played by Akiko Wakabayashi and Mie Hama who are not only good looking (Hama, especially, looks great in a bikini), but can take care of themselves as well; a great title song and score by John Barry; tremendous stunt and action sequences (the helicopter dumping of the SPECTRE car into Tokyo Bay, the fight at the Kobe docks, the Little Nellie battle with the SPECTRE helicopters, the battle in the volcano, etc.); and, especially a great visual look courtesy of Ken Adam's spectacular sets (the volcano/rocket silo set alone should have earned Adam the Oscar for set design) and Freddie Young's cinematography.

There are, however, major problems with the film. Donald Pleasance as Blofeld and Tetsuro Tamba as Tiger Tanaka are woefully miscast in their roles. Blofeld in the books is a large man with silver hair and a magnetic presence. By contrast, Pleasance's Blofeld seems more like a petulant child who can't get his way (when he instructs one of his underlings to ""Kill Bond ... NOW!!"", he sounds like a spoiled brat who wants his mother to buy him the latest toy at FAO Schwartz). Similarly, Tiger Tanaka, in the book You Only Live Twice, is a huge man the size of a sumo wrestler with a gregarious personality. Tamba, in contrast, looks like a bank clerk.

The screenplay by Roald Dahl is, at best, Bond Screenwriting 101 material. Dahl's dialogue makes cardboard cutouts of the characters and is completely overwhelmed by the spectacular stunt and set pieces. Unlike Richard Maibaum, Dahl is completely unable to flesh out the characters and make them seem real to the audience. He even gets the Bond martini wrong when he has Dikko Henderson (Charles Gray) state that it is ""stirred ... not shaken.""

In my opinion, however, the biggest weakness of You Only Live Twice is ... Sean Connery. I know that most Bond fans will consider this blasphemy, but this is not only Connery's weakest performance as Bond, it's his weakest performance in ANY film. Connery was originally signed to do a Bond film every year from 1962 to 1967. However, Connery became so disenchanted with both the time it took to film the movies and the direction of the series, Broccoli and Saltzman released him from his contract after Thunderball and signed him to a one picture deal, hoping that would convince him to stay on as James Bond after You Only Live Twice. Connery, however, was so disenchanted over being typecast as James Bond that he sleepwalked through the filming of You Only Live Twice. In the film, he is overweight, slow-moving, disinterested, uncharismatic and basically looks like an actor fulfilling the last picture of a contract. Connery's charm and appeal, for the only time in his career, are completely absent. During the Little Nellie fight with the SPECTRE helicopters, for example, he looks like he's about to fall asleep. Compare Connery's performance in YOLT with those in the other Bond films, The Man Who Would Be King, Robin and Marian, The Untouchables and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and it's easy to see that his heart wasn't into it and that he was sick of the role. Luckily for Bond fans, his performance in Diamonds Are Forever and Never Say Never Again were up to the usual Connery standard. However, Connery's performance in You Only Live Twice, plus the film's other weaknesses, relegate the film to the second tier of Bond films.",1196121600,,3433,4.825127334465195
414976,5,630202028X,"This is the Bond I grew up on, and no one can replace him in my eyes.  This is one of the best films in his series, no doubt, from the crash of sumo wrestlers to the spectacular climax where the chief of Spectre at last has bond in his sights.  Indeed, I think it is one of the best action films ever made.

I bought this for my kids and we have watched this with utter delight several times, laughing and screaming and talking about Japan and Asia and espionage.  Mindless, to be sure, but the ride is simply wonderful.  There are so many iconic moments in this, from breaking the statue on the martial-arts assassin's head to the pirhana pool to poison down a string.

Warmly recommended as family fun.",1196035200,5,704,4.295454545454546
414977,4,630202028X,"Sean Connery announced his retirement from the Bond franchise after this film (yet comes back for ""Diamonds Are Forever"" and ""Never Say Never Again""), and seemingly a proper thing to do, as it shows in You Only Live Twice that he is not up to par anymore compared to the first 4 Bond movies.  The script and story doesn't help too much either in this outing, though it is still good to say the least.  Lots of action and the largest Bond budget yet do keep this very entertaining though, as well as the beautiful locales of Japan.  But lots of cheesiness, uninteresting charcaters, and a dissapointing reveal of the great ""Blofeld"" keep this movie from being one of the better Connery Bond films.

One thing that will make this movie a more enjoyable experience, is making sure that you do not watch any Austin Powers movies anytime soon before, since this film is where most of the parodies are taken from (the bald villain, the volcano lair, and rocket ships swallowing other rocket ships in space).  With that said, the cheesiness is still there, as are some good ol' 1960's effects, but overall, given the large budget this movie had everything is still amazing for its time.  Action highlights include the little nellie air flight scene, some good one on one Bond fights, and the exciting cimactic Volcano lair battle - filled with ninjas.

In addition to some enjoyable action, the location of Japan is an extreme felt change compared to previous Bond films.  There are several beautiful shots of the Japanese area, especially arial views.  Several scenes of Tokyo, a ninja training camp, and a sumo fight are also some location highlights.

The story is not as tight as the previous Bond films, but it still packs a similar type of fun-filled adventure.  Some scenes are a little longer than one might like, and uninteresting charcaters get too much screen time.  Once again, SPECTRE makes its return, and finally in its strongest form, revealing its number one agent - Blofeld.  We have only heard the voice of the super-villain in previous films, but the face is finally revealed.  The bald figure with the massive facial scar seemed somewhat fitting, but Donal Pleasance's whinny voice is completely unfitting compared to the Blofeld voice previoulsy heared in films.

Despite its many flaws, this is still Bond, and still a much better Bond film than many of the more recent.  This is still a fun-packed and exciting ride that has one of the most unique feels to it.  Watching the fist four Bond films first (specifically for the SPECTRE aspect) makes You Only Live Twice that much better.

414978,5,630202028X,"What makes this film so amazing is the location and the special effects of the film. What you see is basically what you get. The last fight scene in the Volcano is worth seeing alone, but this movie just offers so much else. Besides seeing Japan, you also get an in-sight into Japanese culture, particularly the Japanese wedding. That's not to say that locations and special effects are the only reasons to watch this movie, but they are impressive.

The story is very interesting and is somewhat copied in future Bond films, such as The Spy Who Loved Me and Tomorrow Never Dies. All three films are about trying to get two countries to go to war against each other by blaming one another, the thing is, this was the first film to do it. Donald P. makes for an interesting Blofeld, but I wouldn't say particularly a menacing one. I mean look at him, he looks at least a foot shorter than Bond in the film. But the film gets points for being the first time we actually see Blofeld's face, and the make up used on Donald's face looks great.

Overall, this is just another classic Bond film that gets over-shadowed by Goldfinger but is still a very enjoyable film.",1191801600,4,1161,4.471698113207547
414979,3,630202028X,"The year is 1967 and two years have elapsed between the last Bond picture ""Thunderball"" and this one ""You only live Twice"".The first time that this happened. The two year gap however did not improve things in the Bond world and even though this film would prove to be a slight come down from the previous effort it is still an enjoyable Bond romp and he and we finally get to meet the infamous Dr. Blofeld face to face.
The prologue opens in space and a Gemini space craft is in earth orbit. One of the astronauts is doing a space walk. Suddenly they are approached by a huge rocket. It swallows up the entire space capsule but severs the astronauts' life line,leaving him to float lifeless in space. The scene switches to earth and Toyko,Japan where Bond has just concluded ""negotiations"" with a lovely Japanese lass. The door swings open and in rush several assassins. The bed recesses into the wall with James in it and the group opens fire. The police later enter the picture and pull the bed down to discover a lifeless Bond. Dead!
We cut to the opening credits and a beautiful theme rendition by none other than Nancy Sinatra begins. Those that have given short shrift to Nancy in the past may want to revisit this song. In fact her more recent opening movie song for ""Kill Bill,Vol. 1"" called ""Bang,Bang"" was another small tour de force.
The movie begins and James is getting a proper British Navy funeral with all the military honours accorded to someone of his stature. His body is given back to the sea and we follow it as it floats down to the bottom wrapped in white. However two Navy divers approach,recover the body and bring it aboard the Navy vessel in secret. We find out shortly he isn't dead at all but this is a big cover up British Intelligence is doing to find out who is behind the rocket-nappings as the U.S. rocket has recently come down in the Sea of Japan somewhere.
Later we see the Russians performing the same earth orbit activities as their U.S. counterparts earlier. Their space capsule too,cosmonauts and all,get swallowed up and returned to earth like the other before. It lands (again)somewhere in the vast sea off Japan. East/West tensions are now running high as both sides are blaming the other for these unusual occurences. Something will have to be done before all out war ensues.
Bond heads back into Tokyo and meets up with his contact there;Henderson played by Charles Gray(famous for his later role of the narrator in ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"").Henderson is unceremoniously murdered before he can reveal who he thinks is behind this mess.
James heads to a big Japanese firm called Osato Co.which he suspects(rightly so)is a SPECTRE front. Mr. Osato(Teru Shimada)is on to him right away and his assitant Aki(Akiko Wakabayashi) becomes Bonds femme fatale for this film and like all the others won over to his side by the end. James pokes around to discover that Osatos' product cannisters are full of liquid oxygen,not their usual legit product. This would mean he is supplying the powers behind this situation some of the tools it needs for its' operations into space. His poking around is cut short and he barely makes it out alive after a prolonged battle with Osatos' henchmen.
As he is returning to base Bond is kidnapped. We soon find out that this time it is friendly. A powerful and influential contact in Japan Tiger Tanaka(Tetsuro Tamba) is there to assist him in any way he can. He revels at how easy it was to catch James but he also realizes he needs his valuable help. It seems Blofeld is behind all of the space-nappings but Tanaka has searched all over and around Japan yet hasn't been able to locate his operational headquarters. Bond finally returns to base and with the help of ""Q"" obtains another new and much needed gadget...a one man helicopter(similar to the one in later years in ""Mad Max"").
He island hops around Japan. He finally spots an aerial vehicle diappear into an extinct volcanic crater. He investigates but finds nothing but a small lake at the bottom. All seems alright.....but how could this be? He returns to the scene with Aki and they descend into the crater. They reach the bottom only to find the ""lake"" is fake. It has been painted on and is metallic. Just as he walks across it it opens to reveal to them the hideout of Dr. Blofeld and his operations. Aki is sent back to Tanaki to bring back the cavalry to help him overthrow Blofeld and his huge company of no goods.
James slowly,with the help at one point of suction cups,makes his way cautiously down the precipitous slopes into the deep cavern. He does a bit of sabotage but not long before he's caught. Here we finally meet Dr. Blofeld(Donald Pleasance).He has a large facial scar,no sense of humour and his plans were to sit back and let the world go to war over the incidents in space he created. After all was done,he would re-enter the outside world to pick up the pieces and rule it. Now he means also to finally dispose of the man who has foiled so many of his criminal operations for five years now. Bond is non-plussed but is happy when Tanaka and company finally do arrive. It's a bloody fight for Tanakas' men from the top into the cave but they finally reach James and Aki inside. Will they be in time to thwart another rocket launch? Will Blofeld actually get to take over the world? Will Bond get the best of Blofeld?
All is revealed in the last 15 minutes and it involves alot of nailbiting on our parts!
""You only live Twice"" was another movie in the early series that didn't quite seem to have all the rockets firing at the same time,all the time. As in the second movie(see my review on that) we have some superfluous parts that could have been judiciously excised in editing to give this movie a bit more punch. I think they tried limiting Bonds' location trotting for this reason too but it wasn't quite enough. Also I thought Donald Pleasance as good an actor as he was and a good pick for this part,was nonetheless a bit of a let down. He played the part a bit too coldly and too close to the chest,one might say. This wasn't a Dr. No part that was just right for that movie. This one called for a part played much larger and with more ""umph"" to it.
Having said that though this movie has much to offer its' viewers as usual. More new gadgets,spectaular fights,explosions and new and new exotic locations,i.e. Japan and what could be more exotic and different than outer space? The Gemini space program was front and center news at this time and the moon wasn't far off in the agenda so this was very current stuff and bound to attract a wider audience. Also the stunt work again was superb. Alot of karate action takes place,in fact a ninja training school we visit in the film actually belongs to the good guys!
Although not quite up to previous standards and a slightly weaker entry than others it does have something the later ones would never have..the class that was Sean Connery. And with the film now remastered and more vibrant than ever before...it is a must see.",1190073600,2,7042,4.558800315706393

This Bond movie has drifted from the original further than its predecessors, with elements of creativity while keeping to some of the trappings of the original, such as Bond impersonating a Japanese, and ninjas on the good guys side.

Donald Pleasance is the first of three actors to play villain Blofeld, this one with a scarred face.  The other two actors did not have that scar.  But this is the movies, so does it matter?  The book was the next to the last of Ian Fleming's novels, with only ""Man With A Golden Gun"" following it.  This movie is earlier in the series, and only has a loose connection to previous movies, primarily SPECTRE.

If you want a thrilling adventure, go for this one.",1187740800,,820,4.449664429530201
414983,4,630202028X,"Ah, it is a tough call, trying to rate a movie as fun as this.  Holding such an iconic status as it does, how do you keep your bias in check and look at the movie without those nostalgic rose coloured specs?
As witness for the defence, I would like to call Ken Adams - creator of the 1 million dollar volcano set, this action sequence at the end of the movie set a standard for Bond movies for a  very long time... so much so that it is recreated in different guises in `The Spy who loved me', and `Moonraker'.  It is certainly the most spectacular set and largest scale action sequence in a Bond movie yet.
Next witness - Sean Connery - yes, he seems a little more weary in the role than he did in Thunderball, but while not at his peak, he is still fit and charming enough to be the definitive James Bond (at least when not wearing insanely unconvincing Japanese prosthetics).
John Barry - who produces another great and imaginative score here, one of the last to sound truly original.
And then I call Little Nellie - the signature gadget for the film, a weapon loaded gyrocopter,  is a great success, not just for the aerial action sequence, but also for getting `Q' out of the office and into the field for a change!

But then comes the witnesses for the prosecution... If I call Blofeld to the stand, then you will find what at first appears to be brilliant casting, turns out to be too little too late in the movie. Donald Pleasance as just the right creepiness for the role, but never truly brings the character to life, and demasking Blofeld only seems to tarnish some of the mythos that had been built up around him.
The same holds true if I call Bond's ladies to the stand.  Helga Brandt may have a healthy chest, but is a pale pale imitation of the evil Fiona Volpe from Thunderball.  And the Japanese ladies have a novelty value, but never appear to truly have an impact on Bond.
Then there is the screenplay.  Roald Dahl is a genius, but somewhere between the story, the screenplay of the story and the screen, some magic has been left out.  When I watched this with an audience, a third of them were sleeping through the middle sagging part of the movie.
Part of the joy, and also part of the problem is that some of the international flair has been left out of this movie to concentrate on one location - Japan.  The location is therefore well explored in both culture and geography, but a certain variety and roving nature to Bond's exploits is missing.
I call the effects to the stand... Bond always worked best when the stories were timeless.  By using a space age plot, the plot device, effects, and concept are all immediately dated.  Bear in mind this movie was conceived long before man walked on the moon.
And then I'd like to call Little Nellie.  Yes, the same Little Nellie called by the defence.  Is it used craftily integrated into the plot?  No, we see a scene where he is attacked predictably by helicopters, and goes through the gadgets one by one until they are all used and he goes home.  It's just not as clever as say, the tear gas in the case from `From Russia with Love'.
Critically, there is the myth of Bond himself.  Where in previous Bond movies he was a spy who through tradecraft and hard work (and occasionally seducing beautiful women) would find his way to the evil masterminds lair, here it is as if the character stumbles from one situation to the next, rather than driving events.  This was to hold true for Bond for many years to come, with the exception of `On Her Majesty's Secret Service'.

The verdict?  A hung jury... It is a movie that perhaps tries too hard to go bigger and better in many respects. And so we have a movie with two hats -  It introduces some fun ideas, such as M and Moneypenny having a mobile office in a submarine - the first of many mobile offices for M, and seeing Bond in naval uniform for the first time.  But it also fails to achieve the characterisation that had gone before and relies on the goodwill from previous movies a little too hard.  Thus, we all love You Only Live Twice, but have to be honest, it is harmless fun, but not a classic.  Majority verdict in favour of the defence.

What does the Ultimate Edition have to offer to persuade you to part with your cash?  Truth be told, this is where it gets interesting. The picture is flawless, yes, but it is the sound that really becomes 3 dimensional in the dts mix, giving the rockets shooting into space much more realism and depth than the on screen effects do.  Even background noises are clearer and dialogue sparkling, thanks to some nifty digital remastering.
All the extras from the Special Edition are present and correct, and everyone should watch the superb (as usual) half hour documentary `Inside You Only Live Twice'.  Also included for the first time though are three items.  Firstly, some of Ken Adams home video footage of location scouting and then shooting of the movie, which is great fun to watch to see both the construction of the set and Sean Connery clowning around at every opportunity.  Then there is a short segment from Whickers World, which is an entertaining period fluff piece promoting the movie - while still acknowledging its campness and humour make it an antidote for the times.  Finally an oddity, a one hour special `Welcome to Japan, Mr Bond' which uses MoneyPenny and Q in specially shot scenes to frame a selection of clips from the movies to this point.  Interesting for fans of Q especially, this purports to be Moneypenny musing over who it can be that James Bond will marry.
All in all, I can only recommend this DVD as a worthwhile watch, while acknowledging it is just not as finely crafted as its predecessors.  This Ultimate Edition series once again proves to be the best and most comprehensive way to see the movie.",1187740800,38,5806,4.46780303030303

415003,5,630202028X,"Yes, it's the one with the hollowed out volcano and what a fun ride it is too. It should come as no surprise to anyone that for me (who ranks the earily similar plot-wise TSWLM at #2 of Bond movies and is a fan of Roger Moore's portrayal) that ""You Only Live Twice"" is high on my list of favorite Connery movies.

It's fun and zany and like a Godzilla movie on steroids Bond is plunged into a kinetic, energized Japan. A country that is reeling from an identity crisis following a humiliating defeat in WWII for the traditional nation and the onslaught of 1960s pop culture of which the Bond phenomenon was a major part.

Connery for his part looks bored and tired with the role and so the film makers understandably have loaded this movie with special effects, martial arts fighting, gimmicks and yes, a hollowed out volcano. All in the hopes that Connery will get lost in the mix and his lack of enthusiasm for the part less evident as the viewers senses are assaulted by a vibrant concoction composed of all the spectacle and wonder that screenwriter Dahl and director Lewis Gilbert could conceive.

The mission seems ripped from the headlines to use an old clich&eacute;. The time is the late 1960s and with the US and USSR locked in a race for the dominance of space, the two nations are both having capsules hijacked by some unknown power. Of course in the hyperactive paranoia of the Cold War - each blames the other. But Britain, in its infinite wisdom, stands by their claim that their tracking placed the object (that seized an American rocket) land somewhere in the sea of Japan.

The movie begins with one of my all-time favorite pre-credits sequences. Bond is in bed with an attractive Chinese girl. In what appears to be a double-cross however she pushes a button that sends the bed into the wall before letting a couple of assassins in who pepper the bed with bullet holes. Having the hero ""killed off"" at the beginning of the movie is a gimmick that has been copied often (and in fact first echos the opening of ""From Russia With Love."" But Gilbert crafts it expertly.

A solid entry in the Bond series - too light for some, but certainly a lot of fun throughout.",1175990400,9,2179,4.520304568527918
415004,5,630202028X,"YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE contained elements of espionage, action, thrills, adventure and science fiction. Looking back it somehow worked loosely when put together yet till this day I can not determine what the cohesive element was. Looking at it closely the film is a real dichotomy of styles. The first hour is excellently filmed and works very well. We get to see James Bond the spy, working with recognition codes, breaking into safes, going under cover and the like. There is an excellently choreographed fight scene between Bond and a sumo wrestler. This is also the first time he developed a good working relationship with a fellow intelligence head, Tiger Tanaka, similar to that of Kerim Bey in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. We also see that ""M"" has absolute confidence in his man. ""This is the big one,"" he tells Bond knowing that 007 is the only one capable of pulling off this assignment. There is also quite a bit of very witty dialog in the first hour of this film. In the first hour the pace is deliberate, but never boring or unentertaining. It ends with Bond flying ""Little Nellie,"" delivered by ""Q,"" into an aerial dogfight with four helicopters. As it moves into the second hour more of the science fiction and fantasy elements start to take center stage. The film starts to look untidy and meanders along till it gets to the excellently filmed battle between Tanaka's ninjas and Blofeld's private army in his Volcano lair. It's not a bad Bond film, but it should have been a lot better. I think the culprit was the editing. Russian and American manned space capsules were being snatched out of orbit by an ""intruder missile."" Bond had to find the location and the identity of those responsible before World War III breaks out. The filmmakers decided not to surprise us at the end of the film, but instead show us, not Bond, that this ""intruder missile"" is in fact owned by SPECTRE and is being launched from Blofeld's Volcano lair in Japan. That comes a little past the hour mark. That being the case there was a good opportunity to develop suspense, as Bond has to locate the launch site. When Bond finally does find the volcano he has very little reaction to his discovery. He in fact seems to have come prepared with suction cup kneepads, which he uses to climb upside down and into the volcano. Tanaka shows up with his men, the battle ensues and Bond saves the day. It just could have been done much better considering how well the first half of the film was handled. The massive sets designed by Ken Adam were highly innovative and stylized and are probably the best of the entire series. M's office aboard the submarine, M-1, was also pretty innovative incorporating furniture and decorations from his office from the Ministry of Defense back in London. John Barry wrote a brilliant score. His music for the ""Capsule in Space"" was eerily ominous. He also incorporated sections of the ""James Bond Theme"" very effectively subsequent to Henderson's death and the fight in Osato's office. Barry's ""Mountains and Sunset"" went beautifully with Freddie Young's Cinematography. This and his score for ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE were the last to contain his best action pieces for the series. These were little snippets here and there written to give the action a little more punch. I thought Sean Connery gave some his best performances as James Bond in this film. Bond's scene with Henderson was very good. His repartee with Moneypenney was one of his best. Sean Connery did return as James Bond in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER but one era had already ended with ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and a new one would begin with his return.",1175558400,,3641,4.726415094339623

The 2 stars is for the movie. I think Daniel Craig is the best Bond, but I love Sean Connery and the first three Bond movies were truly great. This is one of Connery's worst outings. Not as bad as Diamonds Are Forever but it is pretty lame. I can only imagine that it was so bad that Connery himself did not want to participate any longer. It is probably due to peculiar industry redtape that On Her Majesty's Secret Service, which was released after this one was a great success (though not a money-maker), but Connery left at the right moment. I'll mention just one reason, among many, that shows why this movie sucks: Sean Connery is surgically altered to become Japanese! This would happen in Star Trek, but not a Bond film. Sean Connery was brilliant as the originator of this stylish icon, but this dismal money-maker shows its age.",1175040000,3,1012,4.565934065934066

415007,2,630202028X,"Coming on the heels of the two-action packed films GOLDFINGER and THUNDERBALL, it was only inevitable that the James Bond series would trip and fall.  YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE is the fifth entry into the Bond series and by this time everyone looks a bit tired.  The film had a budget that was larger than ever, beautiful shots of Japan, one of the largest sets ever built (SPECTRE's volcano lair), and, of course, Connery.  Despite having all of these elements, however, the storyline diverts sharply from Fleming's original design and the film suffers from what we might call ""action bloat.""  There seems to be no room for the character of James Bond to develop--or, for that matter, any of the other characters in the film.  Everything seems to fall prey to the size of the production and the elements that drove the films when they had significantly smaller budgets seem to be completely gone.  One really can't blame Connery for deciding (at the time) that YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE would be his last Bond film.

After the opening ""gun barrel"" sequence, the opening pre-credits ""teaser"" quickly gets underway.  The film opens up on a mysterious spacecraft that gobbles up the manned Jupiter capsules of the United States.  The US immediately assumes that the Russians are up to no good and tensions run high between the two countries.  Britain, cool as ever, remains unconvinced of the Russian involvement.  While the Americans have been rushing around pointing the finger, Britain has been closely following the space capsule, tracking its landing to somewhere in the Sea of Japan.  Naturally, Britain's number one man is on the job.  We quickly cut to our hero, in a fold-out wall bed with the beautiful Ling (Tsai Chin).  Suddenly, Ling collapses the bed, trapping James Bond inside!  Armed gunmen run in a moment later and riddle the bed with their machine guns.  The bed is unfolded to reveal the body of James Bond...dead.  As in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, this is the second time James Bond has met his end at the top of the film.  The title credits follow, produced by Maurice Binder (returning from DR. NO and who would go on to produce most of the credits for the rest of the series), mixing a colorful pinwheel pattern, the faces of Asian women, and scenes of a flowing volcano.  The title song, sung by Nancy Sinatra, is quite peaceful, lending a particular mood to the rest of the film.

The plot of YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE is one of the most convoluted ever.  Bond, of course, is not dead.  He has merely faked his death in order to fool his enemies for a little while and create some ""breathing"" room (hence, the meaning of the film's title).  After shoving his body off a British naval ship, he is promptly recovered and transported to a British submarine where Moneypenny and M are waiting for him in some makeshift quarters.  Bond's mission is to track down the mysterious spacecraft and to discover who is operating her.  Japan is not capable of such a task, but who is?  Bond must succeed in order to prevent WW III from breaking out.  Bond travels to Tokyo and quickly begins following Osato Chemicals, a chemical firm that we later find to be furnishing a component of rocket fuel to the mysterious party.  That party, we discover, is none other than SPECTRE, this time led personally by Blofeld himself.  China is financing the effort in the hopes that the United States and Russia will destroy themselves in the aftermath of the space hijackings.  Bond must discover Blofeld's secret launch facilities and stop the evil villain before the US loses another spacecraft.  Will he make it in time?

One can't watch YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE without being reminded of the previous Bond films.  Once again, we have a plot that involves threatening the US space program (as in DR. NO).  But this time, the Chinese are involved in the hopes that the major powers of the East and West will destroy themselves (as they were hoping in GOLDFINGER), in a scheme that tries to bring back the espionage excitement of FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE.  Alas, this plan is not quite as baked as the one Kronsteen provides in that film and it fails to live up to any of its predecessors.  Roald Dahl, interestingly, was chosen to write the screenplay and it is the first Bond film to greatly divert from Fleming's original vision.  Unfortunately, one gets the sense that it is merely trying to copy-cat the original Bond experience.  With new director Lewis Gilbert at the helm, YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE feels very different from the four films that preceded it.

But it is certainly on the largest scale possible.  SPECTRE launches into space to swallow up American and Russian spacecraft, only to re-enter the atmosphere safely and land in a secret hidden volcano.  The volcano set, designed by talented Ken Adam, is one of the largest I've ever seen and the fight sequences performed in it are truly spectacular in scope.  In the film's climactic fight sequence, a hundred Japanese samurai warriors descend from the mouth of the volcano on ropes into a virtual war zone.  It has to be seen to be believed.  One thing that does look remarkably cheesy, given the film's budget and time, is the special effects involving the spacecraft's launch and re-entry into Earth's atmosphere.  Along with the cartoonish volcano's eruption at the end of the picture, these special effects sequences seem like they are out of a low-budget 1950s picture and do not belong in the same movie as Ken Adam's set.

Unfortunately, I think that the shear size of the picture is the reason the film ultimately fails.  With so many huge sets and action sequences, there is no room left for storytelling and character development.  Connery, while competent, has nowhere to go in this film and seems strangled by the plot.  The Bond girls, with the exception of Aki (Akiko Wakabayashi), are reduced to mere eye candy.  While beautiful to look at, Kissy Suzuki (Mie Hama) and Karin Dor (Helga Brandt) are not even characters.  The wonderful personalities of Honey Ryder and Pussy Galore are gone.  Even the villain Ernst Blofeld (Donald Pleasence), who makes his first on-screen appearance, is comically lacking.  He is not merely as menacing as the faceless character we met in earlier films, in which only a chilling voice was heard.  I think the producers should have left him in the chair, hidden by his cat and voice.  Q (Desmond Llewelyn) makes his mandatory appearance, this time only armed with ""little Nellie,"" the famous gyrocopter that is outfitted like the Aston Martin DB5.  Unfortunately, the copter seems thrown in for effect, for all of its gadgets are immediately put to the test in a seven minute combat sequence.  It is fun to watch, but the gadgets lose their appeal when they appear to be thrown into the film rather than worked into the plot.

Ultimately, YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE seems like a middling Bond flick.  Were it any other action picture, it might pass for a wonderful special effects piece--a stuntman's film.  But given that it's a Bond film, it just doesn't quite meet the standard.  Despite being known for their spectacular action and adventure, every good Bond film must involve excellent storytelling and character development.  If you sacrifice these elements for more action, you are doomed to failure.  The Ultimate Edition, once again, has fantastic DTS 5.1 sound and a remarkably clear picture.  The second disc contains a ""Making of"" documentary, a film about Maurice Binder and his incredible contribution to the Bond series, and the usual trailers, TV spots, et cetera.  If you love the film (or are a ""completist""), I would highly recommend this edition of the film.  But if you are looking for the best of the best from Bond, look elsewhere.",1174089600,5,7730,4.776186887716654
415008,4,630202028X,"Sean Connery's FIRST swan song to the Bond series.  Despite his dislikes of fame while making this film, and a totally preposterous and unbelieveable plot, this is epic 60's Bond at it's best!  Bond goes Japanese to stop that dispicable SPECTRE from causing WWIII by hijacking American and Russian space capsules.  Connery still gives as good as he gets, even though his transformation to look Japanese is a bit cheesy.

415009,4,630202028X,"The fifth James Bond movie was quite an evolution from ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia with Love."" Gadgets galore, ever more exotic locations, double entendres along with a large dose of other witty remarks establish the James Bond as we know him today. It is perhaps this evolution that makes many Bond fans consider ""Goldfinger,"" with fewer witticisms and gadgets, yet a fully developed spy character, to be the best Bond movie. Regardless of whether you felt the Bond movies were going down hill after ""Goldfinger"" or not, I still like a lot about this Bond movie.

After the traditional opening scene, the movie opens with one of the best of the early credits openings. Nancy Sinatra, of ""These Boots Are Made for Walking"" fame, sings ""You Only Live Twice"" beautifully while umbrella framework shadows background scenery. In some ways I thought this opening was one of the more innovative openings until the opening for ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Cheryl Crow doing the song honors.

Moving past the opening, S.P.E.C.T.R.E. is attempting to start a world war by stealing US and Soviet space craft while they are in orbit, hoping that the two countries will get so mad at each other that they will attack and blow each other up. Even when the US and the Soviet Union were most angry at each other it is extremely unlikely that each would credit the other with the ability to steal their spaceships, and even if they did blame each other, nuclear war over spaceships is implausible at best. Unfortunately, the plot in this movie is as weak as it sounds, so forget about a really evil super villain who has a good conquer the world plan.

One interesting double take is Charles Gray as good guy Henderson. In ""Diamonds are Forever"" Gray gets to come back and be bad guy Ernst Blofeld, taking over for Donald Pleasance in this movie. Donald is just too nice to be Blofeld.

With one exception, the action and special effects are what make this movie. Cheesiest special effect goes to the helicopters shot down by ""Little Nelly"". Think helicopters hung by a string and then blown up. Not what you would call a great special effect. The rest of the special effects ran from good to very good. The underground S.P.E.C.T.R.E. base hidden in the base of a volcano used generally good miniatures, though the wheels didn't turn too well on the spaceship transport. ""Little Nelly"" was a pretty cool gyrocopter, though the scenes of Bond flying it had the usual unreal look of a projected back screen.

The rest of this film contains a host of little details. Secret entrances, trap doors, trap walkways, and of all things, Ninjas! Oh, and the Bond women in this movie tend to show the same polarity of other Bond films. While some of these women are beautiful and compliant, some are ruthless killers. Nothing like equal opportunity!

One side note. This movie was written by Roald Dahl, of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and ""James and the Giant Peach"" fame. While some other reviewers have expressed dismay that a well-known author with Dahl's credentials came up with such a weak story, I consider that Dahl was a lot younger, and the interpretation of the screenplay can make or break a screenplay. While Dahl may have been able to make improvements, responsibility for the relatively weak plot can be shared by many of those involved.

As with the other Ultimate Editions, this movie features the cleanest picture available for ""You Only Live Twice.""  If you are looking to upgrade from VHS, the first DVD release or you are a first time buyer, then this edition is the one to get.

The Ultimate Edition contains several featurettes supposedly never before released on DVD.  Included are ""Welcome to Japan, Mr. Bond,"" ""Whicker's World,"" which was a television show episode that highlighted ""You Only Live Twice,""  and ""On Location with Ken Adam.""  I believe most of the other features on this DVD appeared on either the Special Edition or other releases of ""You Only Live Twice.""

While the plot for this movie is among the weakest of the Bond films, I still think the movie is saved by the nearly non-stop action and special effects. I admit that the one-liners used throughout the movie kept the movie from taking itself too seriously, which may also distract some fans, but there is still one line I enjoy. When Bond meets Aki, a beautiful female Japanese, she says to Bond that she looks forward to working under him. Even Bond looked a little surprised when she said that. James Bond doesn't always get the good one-liners!

Also in this film's favor is the music--""You Only Live Twice"" by Nancy Sinatra is widely acknowledged to be the best of all of the superb James Bond theme music. The script is all right, but it has little in common with the Ian Fleming novel of the same name save the Japanese venue. This is unfortunate because ""You Only Live Twice"" is among the very finest of all of the James Bond novels and contains some of Ian Fleming's best writing. Further, in my opinion the best James Bond flicks are those which hew faithfully to the Ian Fleming novels, as indeed several of them do (Goldfinger, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, From Russia With Love, and Thunderball come to mind).

Overall, this film does provide excellent entertainment for 007 afficianados, and it holds the viewer's interest throughout. The special effects are great fun. James Bond purists will possibly not like the storyline as well as that of the novel, but still, this one rates four stars because it is, at a minimum, fine entertainment if not to be taken too seriously.

415022,3,630202028X,"Throughout Bond's career, the SPECTRE chief had lurked behind the scenes, masterminding horrific crimes and dispensing ruthless punishments to those who disappointed him... The ""You Only Live Twice"" mission revealed that evil had a human face... Blofeld's love of animals extended beyond his white Persian cat: he also kept piranhas... His fishy friends, capable of stripping a person to a skeleton in minutes, were not just for show...

'You Only Live Twice' takes place entirely in Japan... The script is a return to a 'From Russia with Love' type plot in which SPECTRE, backed by Red China, enters the space race by playing off the Russians and Americans... The agent of his plans is a specially designed Intruder rocket which captures spacecraft and returns them to SPECTRE chief Blofeld's secret Japanese volcano hideout...

To trick SPECTRE into lowering his guard on British Secret Service activities in Japan, Bond manages to fake his own death... Under the eye of SPECTRE agents, he is given a proper Naval burial at sea aboard a destroyer in Hong Kong, and his body is sent to the bottom of the harbor where a team of frogmen recover it and bring it to a waiting submarine...

Bond, wearing his full Commander's uniform, is alive, thanks to a special aqualung, and he reports to M aboard the submarine...To avoid further detection, he is placed in one of the submarine's torpedo tubes and fired towards the Hong Kong shore to investigate the missing satellites...

His contact is Henderson (Charles Gray--who later played Blofeld in 'Diamond Are Forever'), who informs Bond of Tiger Tanaka (Tetsuro Tamba), the youthful head of the Japanese Secret Service... Tanaka forged a strong working relationship with Bond... The centers of his operation were an underground Tokyo HQ with its own subway train, an ancient castle, and a training school for his Ninja force...

Although the film does develop a flavor for the Far East--with its beautiful women, emerging technology, and ancient customs--the movie's story is a less than compelling one... Impressive set pieces take over center stage at the expense of a sustained dramatic structure... And ""You Only Live Twice"" jumps up from villain to villain, escapade to escapade, until the final assault on the volcano rocket base puts 007 up against Blofeld for the first time...

In spite of pushing aside a bowl of oysters, and drinking his favorite martini 'stirred, not shaken,' plus Russian vodka and Japanese sake, Bond--lacking his usual charm-- is given little to do in the story... The women in the film are actually much more interesting than him... Aki and Kissy are the advance guard of the new Bond girl--less breathless females who have more equality on the firing line... In other words, they hold their own with Bond and help him out of more than a few scrapes with death...

Aki (Akiko Wakabayashi) is 007's guardian angel in Tokyo... She drives an exotic Toyota 2000 sports car, and wears fancy Western outfits... Kissy (Mie Hama) managed to resist Bond's advances--at least until the mission was accomplished...

Helga Brandt (Karin Dor) turns out to be totally unaffected by Bond's charm... Schooled in the Fiona Volpe-style of assassination, she decides to give Bond a taste of what she has to offer before leaving him to figure a way to escape the falling plane...

Nevertheless 'You Only Live Twice' isn't a bad film, and it does star the best Bond... It also holds off high points: John Barry's most romantic musical sequences, Freddie Young's cinematography, and Moneypenny--very smart in naval uniform--connives to have Bond say 'I love you,' a password chosen for this mission...",1168905600,,3659,5.0447019867549665

415029,3,630202028X,"Bond fakes his death to become a ninja and stop SPECTRE from profiting from WWIII after a series of space-jackings. What the hell? There's not many actions scenes. Sure there's the helicopter dogfight and a couple of chases. But not much else. Women are objects, fisticuffs are plentiful and plot developments hokey.

YOLT has not a chance in hell of being taken seriously. I mean what's the deal with that big metal space shark that gobbles up US and Soviet rockets? The physics of it coming back down to earth standing straight up are laughable. And of course, the bad guy lair just HAS to be in an active/inactive volcano. And nobody knows it's there even though it must have taken a million men and 86 gillion parts to build. But never mind about that.

Like before, the finale has all of Blofeld's men (that's the ORIGINAL Dr. Evil for all you kiddies) dressed in the same colored outfit fight the good guys, who are dressed in a different colored outfit. So it's really easy for brain-dead audiences to tell who's winning amid the incredibly fake fighting and blowing up.

Between the mind, short-lived and sporadic action scenes, Bond does loads of plodding around, investigating, making minor discoveries. Not much excites or interests.

It does have pretty photography and some nice scenery. But, in my opinion, it's a below average Bond adventure.

The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 1.0 mono sound. I'm not sure why they never did a Dolby Digital remastering since Thunderball got one, but it's a servicable sound design nonetheless. There is also a fair amount of extras.",1144540800,3,1602,4.8321167883211675
415030,5,630202028X,"Many reviews I read say that this is one of the weakest OO7 movies. I think thay they are wrong. Y-O-L-T, in my opinion, is one the the most exciting and entertaining Bond films of all time. Sean Connery again gives another good performance as Bond, the production design is spectacular and music is still brilliant. Roald Dahl's script is also brilliant! One of my favourite!",1128211200,3,376,4.712121212121212
415031,2,630202028X,"As it was the first film in the series to largely dismiss its Ian Fleming source material in favor of a new story, it is no surprise that it is largely the first of many Bond failures.  In the original conception, the order should be THUNDERBALL, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, and then YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, as a sort of Blofeld trilogy.  The idea, then, was that YOLT was to show Bond at has absolute lowest after the murder of his wife, out now for personal revenge against Blofeld.  Instead, film fans would have to settle for this silly adventure, followed by the excellent OHMSS, and a final revenge executed once at the opening of DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, lamely a second time at the end of the same film, and a final time in the opening of FOR YOUR EYES ONLY.  Confused yet?

Well, perhaps Connery saw what was coming with this, the fifth film, and decided he wanted out!  That might explain his lack-luster performance, which coupled with DIAMONDS provides two of the worst Bond performances in the entire series.  Yes, this was the film that truly ruined the trajectory of the franchise. Despite several valiant efforts to follow, the series would ultimately fall into the hands of such wretched outings as Roger Moore's SPY WHO LOVED ME, and Brosnan's DIE ANOTHER DAY.

In this film, SPECTRE has the money to build and launch independent rockets that are capable of literally swallowing American and Russian space capsules - then make a controlled landing inside a hollowed-out volcano lair in hopes that America and Russia would blame each other and start WWIII.  One has to wonder, as the AUSTIN POWERS films did, if SPECTRE has the money to finance such an operation, why do they need to resort to petty extortion to continue their funding?  If they just left everything alone, they wouldn't have to spend so much $$$ on these expensive operations!  But, I digress . . .

Along the way, Bond becomes ""thoroughly Japanese"" by putting on false eyebrows and a wig, learns Kung Fu, marries a Japanese fisherwoman, and is widowed in the very next scene.  Somehow, he had to get married so that when he went to raid the volcano, the baddies would believe he was really Japanese - I don't know, it doesn't make sense to me either.

In one scene, just before bedding yet another woman, Bond says to himself, ""Oh, the things I do for England.""  One wonders if Connery himself were saying in his mind, ""The things I do for money!""

The only saving graces are the Japanese locales, the beautiful opening theme (one of the few worth listening to outside of the context of the film), and a fun, albeit unrealistic bit with a souped-up helicopter that fits neatly into four suitcases.

Also look for an early Donald Pleasance appearance as Blofeld, the true genesis for AUSTIN POWERS' Dr. Evil character.  In fact, you will find more in this one film that inspired that series than any other of the Bond movies.

My advice? Skip this one and go straight to the far superior ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE!",1125964800,4,3004,4.644612476370511
415058,4,630202028X,"Though it has little to do with Ian Fleming's novel except for the Japanese setting, ""You Only Live Twice"" (1967) remains among the most spectacular James Bond adventures. Despite Roald Dahl's thin script, director Lewis Gilbert stages the action sequences with kinetic flair and Ken Adam's volcano set remains a stunning creation. After delivering strong performances in the previous Bond outings, Sean Connery simply goes through the motions - his boredom and disenchantment with the 007 franchise painfully evident. Still, Connery's sleepwalking is preferable to the best efforts of Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton. As Blofeld, Donald Pleasence makes the most of his belated appearance. Moving at a faster clip than ""Thunderball"" (1965), ""You Only Live Twice"" survives as the slickest 007 escapade.",1125705600,,800,5.512195121951219

Connery looks like he has gained some weight and he is very sloppy.

415060,4,630202028X,"Yes, it's the one with the hollowed out volcano and what a fun ride it is too. It should come as no surprise to anyone that for me (who ranks the earily similar plot-wise TSWLM at #2 of Bond movies and is a fan of Roger Moore's portrayal) that ""You Only Live Twice"" is high on my list of favorite Connery movies.
It's fun and zany and like a Godzilla movie on steroids Bond is plunged into a kinetic, energized Japan. A country that is reeling from an identity crisis following a humiliating defeat in WWII for the traditional nation and the onslaught of 1960s pop culture of which the Bond phenomenon was a major part.
Connery for his part looks bored and tired with the role and so the film makers understandably have loaded this movie with special effects, martial arts fighting, gimmicks and yes, a hollowed out volcano. All in the hopes that Connery will get lost in the mix and his lack of enthusiasm for the part less evident as the viewers senses are assaulted by a vibrant concoction composed of all the spectacle and wonder that screenwriter Dahl and director Lewis Gilbert could conceive.
The mission seems ripped from the headlines to use an old clich. The time is the late 1960s and with the US and USSR locked in a race for the dominance of space, the two nations are both having capsules hijacked by some unknown power. Of course in the hyperactive paranoia of the Cold War - each blames the other. But Britain, in its infinite wisdom, stands by their claim that their tracking placed the object (that seized an American rocket) land somewhere in the sea of Japan.
The movie begins with one of my all-time favorite pre-credits sequences. Bond is in bed with an attractive Chinese girl. In what appears to be a double-cross however she pushes a button that sends the bed into the wall before letting a couple of assassins in who pepper the bed with bullet holes. Having the hero ""killed off"" at the beginning of the movie is a gimmick that has been copied often (and in fact first echos the opening of ""From Russia With Love."" But Gilbert crafts it expertly.
A solid entry in the Bond series - too light for some, but certainly a lot of fun throughout.",1115337600,10,2166,4.5
415061,2,630202028X,"They've been showing a lot of the Bond films on the Encore channels for the past two months, so I've had a chance to watch almost all of them over again.

YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE has to be my least favorite 007 of the Sean Connery entries.

And Connery looks completely and thoroughly bored for the entire film.  The ""Little Nellie defended her honor"" lines has to be the flattest reading he's ever done.  But nobody cares: it's Sean and he's Bond.

Here's a double feature that might be fun: watch this film and then PARADISE, HAWAIIAN STYLE with Elvis Presley.  Then go around the room and ask for everyone's opinion: which one looked more bored for an entire movie?  James Bond or Elvis Presley.  Could be a whole new party game here.

Some scenes play like they should've been in the dozens of superspy knock-off films of the Sixties: Bond is caught and tied to a chair, menaced by a hot redhead with scalpels--but he seduces her into releasing him, they take off in an airplane, she betrays him and jumps out with a parachute, he frees himself and manages to crash land the plane--WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

The Japanese settings are cool (you can always depend on authentic locales for a Bond film), but the scene where they turn Bond Japanese is laughable: do you really need a surgical room to glue fake eyes onto him?  Can a 6'4"" Scotsman really pass for a Japanese fisherman?

The volcano set was impressive, and it was interesting to finally see the face of Ernst Stavro Blofeld (and his cat freaking out), but this is never the one I pick when I feel like catching a Bond flick.

Connery would come back to play 007 again, largely for laughs, in the campy DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER (still a good time), and then in 1983's NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN, because...well, he could.",1110844800,,1769,4.507836990595611
415062,4,630202028X,"`You Only Live Twice' is the first Bond film to be completely rewritten and if you ever read the novel you'd understand why. Goldfinger took quite a few liberties but this film retains only a handful of elements including the Japanese location and a few characters names.

The film had some extremely talented people working on it. This was back in the days when Ken Adams was doing his fantastic set designs. Blofeld's volcano lair is perhaps the most memorable in the history of Bond films. The music is excellent including Nancy Sinatra's title song which seems slightly lightweight for a Bond film but remains very catchy. For whatever reason there hasn't been a Bond film with this quality of music in at least two decades. Of course Sean Connery is terrific as always. `Twice' hits all the Bond staples; beautiful locations, gorgeous girls and incredible gadgets.

In many ways `You Only Live Twice' became the template for action spy films until many of the staples became too clichd to be anything but parody. The film featured villainous henchmen in matching uniforms, the classic underground lair with monorail and an evil plot so elaborate that the cost surely must exceed any possible financial gain. The plot in `Thunderball' was much more believable but `You Only Live Twice' scores points in sheer audaciousness.

This was what the begginging of the series was leading to and it was a great confrontation. Halloween fans will be happy to know that Donald Plecense (sorry I don't know how to spell his name) plays the infamous Blofeld.

But isn't this film missing a little somthing. Bond is never behind the wheel of a car, and in the middle of the movie he goes under cover and we get aside stroy of his life in a small simple village. This part does not seem very Bond. I think it has to do with the man who wrote the screenplay. Famous author Roald Dahl, writter of Charlie and the Chocalte Factory, and Matilda, took a stab at a serious venture and in some ways messed with things that should not have been messed with.

But don't get me wrong I still like this movie a lot, and the movie has a lot of fun moments, like in the end of the movie Ninjas Vs. armed gunmen, Bond is on the side of the ninjas, who is going to win?

With a script by Roald Dahl (Willy Wonka; James and the Giant Peach) and under the direction of Lewis Gilbert, Bond is once again face to face with the sinister forces of SPECTER.  A fun Bond with the most expensive set design for 1967. A lot of thrills and laughs to make this a pleasant viewing experience.

In this film Bond is out to stop the forces of SPECTER from starting World War III.  Space capsules mysteriously disappear and both the US and the Soviets blame each other.  Bond goes to Asia to find out the fate of the capsules and their astro/cosmonauts.  Bond soon uncovers a sinister plot involving SPECTER and goes undercover to sneak into their mountain base.  Will Bond make it in time against the evil Blofeld (Donald Pleasance) and his minions?

True, this Bond doesn't have the best script but the action sequences are fun: especially the grand finale. Donald Pleasance is excellent as the mannered but sociopathic Blofeld.  The assassins in this film aren't terribly memorable nor are the Bond girls.

 A bit weaker than the monster combination of Goldfinger/Thunderball,YOLT boast many great moments (the unnessesary arial dogfight with Little Nelly, the finale in Blofeld's awesome volcanic lair), but one can't help but feel a tinge of disappointment as it seemed made on auto pilot. YOLT does feature the best ever 007 theme song. A haunting melodic ballad sung by Nancy Sinatra.

 YOLT was to be the last Sean Connery Bond movie(though he would return in Diamonds Are Forever and Never Say Never Again).It also marked the end of an era in the golden age of 007 movies as the latter films of the 70's and early 80's become more tongue and cheek.

The film, directed by Lewis Gilbert of ""Alfie"" fame, is a delight to the eyes and ears, with Ken Adam's sets among the most amazing yet constructed, and John Barry's haunting score, topped by Nancy Sinatra's rendition of the bittersweet title song, tied with his work for ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" as the best of the series.
Unfortunately, the celebrated Dahl lets us down with a script lacking the imagination to which we have become accustomed. 007 relies on pure luck one time too many when finding himself in a bind, and the most publicized aspect of the film, the first appearance of arch-nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld, is anti-climactic thanks to the miscasting of Donald Pleasance (a last minute substitute for an ailing actor).
But ""You Only Live Twice"" is still fun. Sean Connery, in what was supposed to be his last go-round as Bond, still looks engaged by the character, and since this film entered release only two months after the disastrous ""Casino Royale,"" the black sheep Bond film made from the one title not owned by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman's EON productions, in which everyone but Connery played 007, that was enough to make ""You Only Live Twice"" the second biggest hit of 1967 (trailing ""The Dirty Dozen"" by a half million or so).",1073692800,2,1793,4.843648208469055

Donald Pleasance is a great actor, and i love him in Halloween and Escape from New york, but he does not put up a great fight with Bond.  i do like the part where he is about to kill Bond and then shoots Osato, that shows his intensity.  Little Nellie should never have been in this film.  I think that if Connery were still interested in being Bond, then this film would be a lot better.  Roald Dahl's story is far-fetched.  There is some good action at the end, but it is really too short.  The villain does not die, this has never happened before in a Bond film and is a mistake.  The volcano is a great set!  This movie is mediocre, but better than Connery's next two attempts-Diamonds are Forever and Never say Never Again, which were DOWNRIGHT AWFUL.  Connery is not the best bond because Timothy Dalton is a much better actor and Dalton actually cared for and read Ian Fleming's work.

Though its production is certainly of an epic nature, it simply lacks the entertaining quality of previous efforts.  Not all is a misfire in this film however.  There are certainly some impressive action set pieces, the best being the autogyro/helicopter dogfight.  The locations are certainly exotic as practically the entire film takes place in Japan, and production Designer Ken Adam's set for Blofeld's Volcano lair is arguably the most fantanstic in the entire series.  Lord knows ""Austin Powers"" borrowed a lot from this movie, including the physical blueprint of everyone's favorite megalomaniac of the absurd, Dr. Evil.

415092,4,630202028X,"You Only Live Twice had gone down as one of Connery's most criticized Bond flick, but it seemed to be a well-rounded Bond film, in that it involves the archetypal elements of a Bond adventure (i.e. espionage, action, solid fight sequences, suspense) blended with a good dose of science fiction.  In some way, You Only Live Twice became the turning point of the James Bond series as well.
The plot is more promising and more involving.  A mysterious spacecraft captured one American capsule and a Soviet capsule and both countries are pointing fingers at each other.  Remaining neutral, the British send Bond out into the field, who is ""assassinated"" to take a good deal of pressure off his shoulders.  M assigns Bond to venture off to Japan to tag up with ""Tiger"" Tanaka to verify if this spacecraft hails from Japan and to halt it from launching and in essence, Bond and Tanaka are off to thwart World War III.  There isn't much surprise that SPECTRE is responsible.
With so much promise, this edition of Bond is somewhat of a flop.  The dialogue is stale, the villains are just par for the course and the pace of the movie isn't very consistent.  For example, there is a lot more urgency from start until the Soviet spacecraft is hijacked.  Up until the climactic volcano battle, there isn't much purpose in the sequences.  We are taken into an in-depth look of Japanese culture, whether it is the ninja fighting technique or the lifestyle of poor harbor residents and fishermen.  It is there that the movie gets quirky, with the perfectly executed climax saving the latter part of the movie.  However, the biggest flaw of the film is Connery's seemingly uninspired outing.  He wasn't much in shape and he seemed to 'pooh-pooh' everything as if it were just another walk in the park.  Without his passion and energy as 007, You Only Live Twice would be a disappointment, compared to the classic Bond flicks before it and after it.  Despite all the negative aspects of the movie, You Only Live Twice, much like its predecessors does not disappoint in entertainment value and it was influential in virtually every aspect of the Bond series, which either flopped those movies (i.e. Tomorrow Never Dies, Moonraker) or made them into modern-day classics (i.e. The Spy Who Loved Me, Octopussy, Goldeneye).",1054166400,,2301,4.807106598984771
415093,3,630202028X,"There exists general agreement among fans that YOL2 is the weakest Connery chapter. There are a number of reasons offered for this, an important one of which is the surprisingly weak script from Roald Dahl. Modern viewers will recognize a number of stereotypical ""idiotic bad guy"" cliches that have been thoroughly lampooned since this film's 1967 release. The film also lacks particularly frightening villains; what tension is in it is created more by American and Russian stupidity than by the malevolence of a challenging anatgonist. Others blame Connery, suggesting that he had lost interest in portraying the character by the time of this episode, although he returned for DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, the film after the next (and the not-canon NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN). Finally, strict action or special effects fans will compare this movie unfavourably to THUNDERBALL.
In some ways, however, YOL2 also demonstrates a recovery from the direction that THUNDERBALL threatened to take the franchise in. Bond has returned to the humoursly charming womanizer of GOLDFINGER; he's more clown and less lout. Even if one has difficulty suspending disbelief when confronted by the ridiculous orbital manueverings and badly dated sfx, Connery's dry one-liners help to keep one laughing with the film, rather than at it. Bond, while still as supercompetent as he was and will be, is also slightly more human and forced to work a little harder to foil SPECTRE's plot to plunge the world into WWIII. SPECTRE, the criminal organization that will dominate the next two films and was a plot device for FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and THUNDERBALL, finally gets a (disfigured) human face in this movie, as Blofeld (played by the uninspiring Donald Pleasence) is revealed after Bond is captured a second time. YOL2 can, in some ways, be seen as a rather slow chapter moving the larger SPECTRE arc along to its climax in the next film, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE.
The real weakness of YOL2 is its heavy reliance on the exoticism of Japan to carry the movie. To the modern action movie fan Japan has long since lost its ""mysterious Orient"" quality, and so gratuitous scenes involving sumo wrestling, geishas and gun-toting ninjas come across as embarassingly colonial instead of intriguingly foreign. The Japanese characters, including the two Bond women (Akiko Wakabayashi as the delicately competent Aki and Mia Hami as the courageous Kissy), manage, in some occasions, to escape their stereotyping, and Tetsuro Tamba's 'Tiger' Tanaka is a worthy member of the ""helpful local"" Bond gallery,
YOL2 is the first Bond movie that is not plagued by overdubbing problems. In fact, the production complaint I have is that the 007 theme is stretched, too loud to be background, over the long helicopter battle sequence. This is a substantial improvement from its predecessors for those used to today's big-budget action movies.
The casual Bond fan will probably enjoy watching YOL2, but purchasing it for repeated viewing is probably for the collector or serious devotee only.",1047945600,,3043,5.161943319838056
415124,4,630202028X,"The fifth James Bond movie was quite an evolution from ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia with Love"". Gadgets galore, ever more exotic locations, double entendres along with a large dose of other witty remarks establish the James Bond as we know him today. It is perhaps this evolution that makes many Bond fans consider ""Goldfinger"", with fewer witticisms and gadgets, yet a fully developed spy character, to be the best Bond movie. Regardless of whether you felt the Bond movies were going down hill after ""Goldfinger"" or not, I still like a lot about this Bond movie.
After the traditional opening scene, the movie opens with one of the best of the early credits openings. Nancy Sinatra, of ""These Boots Are Made for Walking"" fame, sings ""You Only Live Twice"" beautifully while umbrella framework shadows background scenery. In some ways I thought this opening was one of the more innovative openings until the opening for ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Cheryl Crow doing the song honors.
Moving past the opening, Spectre is attempting to start a world war by stealing US and Soviet space craft while they are in orbit, hoping that the two countries will get so mad at each other that they will attack each other and blow each other up.  Even when the US and the Soviet Union were most angry at each other it is extremely unlikely that each would credit the other with the ability to steal their spaceships, and even if they did blame each other, nuclear war over spaceships is implausible, at best. Unfortunately, the plot in this movie is as weak as it sounds, so forget about a really evil super villain who has a good conquer the world plan.
One interesting double take is Charles Gray as good guy Henderson. In ""Diamonds are Forever"" Gray gets to come back and be bad guy Ernst Blofeld, taking over for the too nice Donald Pleasance in this movie. Donald is just too nice to be Blofeld.
With one exception, the action and special effects are what make this movie. Cheesiest special effect goes to the helicopters shot down by ""Little Nelly"". Think helicopters hung by a string and then blown up. Not what you would call a great special effect. The rest of the special effects ran from good to very good. The underground Spectre base hidden in the base of a volcano used generally good miniatures, though the wheels didn't turn too well on the spaceship transport. ""Little Nelly"" was a pretty cool gyrocopter, though the scenes of Bond flying it had the usual unreal look of a projected back screen.
The rest of this film contains a host of little details. Secret entrances, trap doors, trap walkways, and of all things, Ninjas! Oh, and the Bond women in this movie tend to show the same polarity of other Bond films. While some of these women are beautiful and compliant, some are ruthless killers. Nothing like equal opportunity!
One side note. This movie was written by Roald Dahl, of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and ""James and the Giant Peach"" fame. While some other reviewers have expressed dismay that a well-known author with Dahl's credentials came up with such a weak story, I consider that Dahl was a lot younger, and the interpretation of the screenplay can make or break a screenplay. While Dahl may have been able to make improvements, responsibility for the relatively weak plot can be shared by many of those involved.
While the plot for this movie is among the weakest of the Bond films, I still think the movie is saved by the nearly non-stop action and special effects. I admit that the one-liners used throughout the movie kept the movie from taking itself too seriously, which may also distract some fans, but there is still one line I enjoy. When Bond meets Aki, a beautiful female Japanese, she says to Bond that she looks forward to working under him. Even Bond looked a little surprised when she said that. James Bond doesn't always get the good one-liners.",1042156800,2,3883,4.7102941176470585

The only flaw is where Dikko Henderson (Charles Gray) serves us James' martini ""stirred, not shaken"" when we all know the opposite is how it goes! ('Twas interesting to see Gray later return as Blofeld in ""Diamonds Are Forever"")

415127,4,630202028X,"""You Only Live Twice"" is a James Bond techno-thriller in which Sean Connery, Nancy Sinatra's title song, and the spectacular rocket base set all take turns overwhelming the story.  The script for this 1967 film is based very loosely on Ian Fleming's 1964 novel, is more of a disappointment once you realize it was written by Roald Dahl.  A pair of satellites belonging to the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. are swallowed up by a mysterious spacecraft belonging to SPECTRE, the super-criminal organization run by Ernest Stavro Blofeld, played this time around by Donald Pleasance (and the first time we actually see Blofeld's face).  The idea is to provoke a superpower war so that SPECTRE can come in afterwards and pick up the pieces (presumably all wearing suits to protect them from the radiation).
After ""Moonraker,"" this is the James Bond film that makes the most of science fiction hardware.  The secret rock base is located inside a Japanese volcano, which makes for a big battle sequences between SPECTRE's troops and Japanese ninja secret agents (or would that be secret agent ninjas?).  In retrospect, this scene is one of the most important in the Bond series because it upped the ante for all future films.  There would still be all the fun gadgets and gizmos, but giant set pieces like this one would becomes required elements from here on out.  In fact, Bond movies now usually begin with such set pieces and not just end with them.
""You Only Live Twice"" is a mixed bag.  John Barry's score is his best for the entire Bond series, which says something right there, and the title song gets my vote for being the best of the Bonds as well.  Plus you have Sean Connery as James Bond (even if he thinks he is turning Japanese).  But there are some substantial parts of the film where nothing really happens, and even the beautiful Japanese scenery cannot detract from how badly things start to drag.  However, I appreciate the fact that Mie Hama as Kissy, breaks the Bond girl mold.  For that matter, this film gives Japanese actors a chance to play something other than brutal World War II soldiers or prison guards, which is certainly of some cinematic importance.",1038614400,2,2167,4.749333333333333

Connery looks a bit tired (but hey, he's been ""Bond-ing"" for five years already!), but he still interjects humor into the part.  Pleasance is delightfully evil, & Mie Hama is delicious as the surviving Bond girl.
This movie isn't mindless entertainment (as another reviewer remarked), but is in fact, a reflection of then-current Cold War tensions, as SPECTRE tries to initiate World War III by framing the Americans & the Russians for kidnapping each other's astronauts.
What secret weapon does our man James use to foil the plot?  Simple.  He has an army of NINJAS ARMED WITH MACHINE GUNS!  I like the idea of modern-day, up to date ninjas as a special-forces unit, combining the use of traditional Japanese martial-arts with up to date (or even futuristic, for the 1960's, that is) fire-arms!  (The people who made all of those God-awful ""Ninja"" movies with Sho Kosugi during the 1980's should have seen this film!  Sam Peckinpaugh's ""Killer Elite"" ridiculed ninjas by having his heroes shoot them.  Well this movie is an answer to both of those films, & the ""Turtles"", as well!)
If you like a Cold-War thriller, this is it!  If you like Bond with Connery in the role, this is it!  If you like beautiful Bond girls, this is it!  And, if you're a fan of martial-arts movies, like I am, this is an excellent action film of that type, made before Bruce Lee's ""Enter The Dragon.""

415133,5,630202028X,"Sometime in early 1967 Sean Connery announced that he was through with playing James Bond.  So executive producers decided to try to make 1967's ""You Only Live Twice"" the best 007 adventure to date.  The fifth Bond film was filled with so much action that the plot was met as semi weak compared to his earlier films.
However You Only Live Twice is still one of the best Bond films in the series.  Their are several action scenes are terrific especially the attack on the volcano space station and the Little Nelly pursuit.  The setting in Japan was awesome and the volcano space station set was so neat looking!
The acting in You Only Live Twice is quite good.  Connery is spectacular as Bond as usual.  Donald Pleasence plays Ernst Stavro Bolfeld wonderfully.  I always thought he was the best Blofeld.  Tetsuro Tamba plays Tiger Tanaka Bond's Japanese ally very well. Too bad he never appeared in the series again, I liked his character.  Akiko Wakabayashi plays the adorable Aki but I felt killing her character off was pointless because they merely threw in Kissy played By Mie Hama to replace her and her character was far weaker.  As for the villians well Teru Shimada plays the arrogant Mr. Osato and Karin Dor plays the beautiful yet diabolical Helga Brandt very well.  And of course Bernard Lee, Lois Maxwell and Desmond Llewelyn return in theirrespcted rols as M, Money Penny and Q.
You Only Live Twice's plot is quite underrated as it is deeper than people think Bond fakes his death near the beginning to fool enemy agents.  Then he is sent to Japan to investigate the disappearance of Russian and American spacecrafts and uncovers a plot for a World War 3 against both Superpowers.
Overall despite a few flaes You Only Live Twice is a classic Bond film that I feel is vastly underrated.  Sure it's no Goldfinger or Dr. No but I feel it is still an essential Bond film because the action and the plot are both very good.  Highly recommended!",1015113600,4,1953,4.6395348837209305

There are, however, major problems with the film. Donald Pleasance as Blofeld and Tetsuro Tamba as Tiger Tanaka are woefully miscast in their roles. Blofeld in the books is a large man with silver hair and a magnetic presence. By contrast, Pleasance's Blofeld seems more like a petulant child who can't get his way (when he instructs one of his underlings to ""Kill Bond ... NOW!!"", he sounds like a spoiled brat who wants his mother to buy him the latest toy at FAO Schwartz). Similarly, Tiger Tanaka, in the book You Only Live Twice, is a huge man the size of a sumo wrestler with a gregarious personality. Tamba, in contrast, looks like a bank clerk.
The screenplay by Roald Dahl is, at best, Bond Screenwriting 101 material. Dahl's dialogue makes cardboard cutouts of the characters and is completely overwhelmed by the spectacular stunt and set pieces. Unlike Richard Maibaum, Dahl is completely unable to flesh out the characters and make them seem real to the audience. He even gets the Bond martini wrong when he has Dikko Henderson (Charles Gray) state that it is ""stirred ... not shaken.""
In my opinion, however, the biggest weakness of You Only Live Twice is ... Sean Connery. I know that most Bond fans will consider this blasphemy, but this is not only Connery's weakest performance as Bond, it's his weakest performance in ANY film. Connery was originally signed to do a Bond film every year from 1962 to 1967. However, Connery became so disenchanted with both the time it took to film the movies and the direction of the series, Broccoli and Saltzman released him from his contract after Thunderball and signed him to a one picture deal, hoping that would convince him to stay on as James Bond after You Only Live Twice. Connery, however, was so disenchanted over being typecast as James Bond that he sleepwalked through the filming of You Only Live Twice. In the film, he is overweight, slow-moving, disinterested, uncharismatic and basically looks like an actor fulfilling the last picture of a contract. Connery's charm and appeal, for the only time in his career, are completely absent. During the Little Nellie fight with the SPECTRE helicopters, for example, he looks like he's about to fall asleep. Compare Connery's performance in YOLT with those in the other Bond films, The Man Who Would Be King, Robin and Marian, The Untouchables and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and it's easy to see that his heart wasn't into it and that he was sick of the role. Luckily for Bond fans, his performance in Diamonds Are Forever and Never Say Never Again were up to the usual Connery standard. However, Connery's performance in You Only Live Twice, plus the film's other weaknesses, relegate the film to the second tier of Bond films.",1005004800,5,3430,4.825127334465195
415146,5,630202028X,"One of the best of Ian Fleming's James Bond novels was ""You Only Live Twice,"" the story about James Bond avenging his wife's death at the hands of Ernst Stavro Blofeld.  But producers Harry Saltzman and Cubby Broccoli were put off by the books obsession with death (and the fact that the preceeding book, OHMSS, hadn't been made into a movie yet) and hired Roald Dahl to throw together a story about stolen spacecraft.
Although You Only Live Twice could have been a lot better on the silver screen, it is still an enjoyable film.  Japan is a great setting for what was supposed to be Sean Connery's final Bond.  The directing by Lewis Gilbert is superb.  He puts an interesting twst on several scenes, including a frantic rooftop fight that is shot with a wide angle rather than a closeup.
The plot is fantastic and somewhat silly but it doesn't need to be realistic.  This is a Bond movie, after all.  The story gives Connery the opportunity to partake in several scenes that have become part of the Bond legend.  The helicopter chase is exciting (and dangerous for the aerial cameraman, as I later learned), and the battle inside the impressive hollow mountain (as later spoofed by the Simpsons) is classic Bond action.  Bond even tries to board SPECTRE's rocket, foreshadowing what would come in Moonraker.
My biggest complaint with this film is Blofeld himself.  After concealing his face in the other Bond movies, his revealing is very anti-climactic.  Donald Pleasance never lived up to the meanacing, mysterious Blofeld portrayed by Anthony Dawson in From Russia With Love and Thunderball.  And, after seeing Mike Myers's hillarious Dr. Evil, you can never take him seriously.
You Only Live Twice is classic James Bond fun and excitement.  It is also the inspiration for another great movie franchise, Austin Powers.  If you like either series of movies, make sure to watch You Only Live Twice.",1004745600,3,1901,4.848297213622291
415147,5,630202028X,"YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE contained elements of espionage, action, thrills, adventure and science fiction. Looking back it somehow worked loosely when put together yet till this day I can not determine what the cohesive element was. Looking at it closely the film is a real dichotomy of styles. The first hour is excellently filmed and works very well. We get to see James Bond the spy, working with recognition codes, breaking into safes, going under cover and the like. There is an excellently choreographed fight scene between Bond and a sumo wrestler. This is also the first time he developed a good working relationship with a fellow intelligence head, Tiger Tanaka, similar to that of Kerim Bey in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE. We also see that ""M"" has absolute confidence in his man. ""This is the big one,"" he tells Bond knowing that 007 is the only one capable of pulling off this assignment. There is also quite a bit of very witty dialog in the first hour of this film. In the first hour the pace is deliberate, but never boring or unentertaining. It ends with Bond flying ""Little Nellie,"" delivered by ""Q,"" into an aerial dogfight with four helicopters.  As it moves into the second hour more of the science fiction and fantasy elements start to take center stage. The film starts to look untidy and meanders along till it gets to the excellently filmed battle between Tanaka's ninjas and Blofeld's private army in his Volcano lair. It's not a bad Bond film, but it should have been a lot better. I think the culprit was the editing. Russian and American manned space capsules were being snatched out of orbit by an ""intruder missile."" Bond had to find the location and the identity of those responsible before World War III breaks out. The filmmakers decided not to surprise us at the end of the film, but instead show us, not Bond, that this ""intruder missile"" is in fact owned by SPECTRE and is being launched from Blofeld's Volcano lair in Japan. That comes a little past the hour mark. That being the case there was a good opportunity to develop suspense, as Bond has to locate the launch site. When Bond finally does find the volcano he has very little reaction to his discovery. He in fact seems to have come prepared with suction cup kneepads, which he uses to climb upside down and into the volcano. Tanaka shows up with his men, the battle ensues and Bond saves the day. It just could have been done much better considering how well the first half of the film was handled. The massive sets designed by Ken Adam were highly innovative and stylized and are probably the best of the entire series. M's office aboard the submarine, M-1, was also pretty innovative incorporating furniture and decorations from his office from the Ministry of Defense back in London. John Barry wrote a brilliant score. His music for the ""Capsule in Space"" was eerily ominous. He also incorporated sections of the ""James Bond Theme"" very effectively subsequent to Henderson's death and the fight in Osato's office. Barry's ""Mountains and Sunset"" went beautifully with Freddie Young's Cinematography. This and his score for ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE were the last to contain his best action pieces for the series. These were little snippets here and there written to give the action a little more punch. I thought Sean Connery gave some his best performances as James Bond in this film. Bond's scene with Henderson was very good. His repartee with Moneypenney was one of his best. Sean Connery did return as  James Bond in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER but one era had already ended with ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and a new one would begin with his return. This DVD is the best print available to date. It is a vast improvement over the letterbox print on Laser Disc. The extras are always welcome but the primary focus for me is always the print of the film. I can't complain.",1004400000,,3864,4.6976401179941005

As far as connery goes, he isn't all that bad and I think its probably his 3rd best film (5th best film in the series). Alot of the reviewers of this film just look at all the ""facts"", but you have to realize, this is an OLD film and special effects were terrible at the time!

James Bond(Sean Connery) finally meets Ernst Stavro Blofeld(Donald Pleasence), who is now attempting to start World War III by hijacking American and Soviet satellites.
""You Only Live Twice"" rivals ""Diamonds Are Forever"" as the worst Sean Connery-James Bond movie.  Although not characterized by the same poor humor that helped to mar ""DAF,""  ""YOLT"" is somewhat bland and uninteresting.  ""YOLT"" is not so much terrible as it is just not very good.
Sean Connery and Donald Pleasence are the saving graces of this movie.  Although ""YOLT"" may be a poor film, an inferior Sean Connery-James Bond movie is still superior to an inferior Roger Moore-James Bond movie.  Sean Connery can save the worst Bond picture.  No one can match his portrayal of this character.  Of the four actors to play a visible Blofeld(Donald Pleasence, Telly Savalas, Charles Gray, Max Von Sydow), Pleasence is the most effective.  As an actor, Pleasence never found the major success that seemed to rightfully belong to him.  He never quite achieved the stardom of Peter Lorre, who played very similar characters. One of cinema's more underrated bad guys, Pleasence adds an appropriately skincrawling and neurotic touch to the Blofeld character.

The only difference is that this bond film contains more special effects and scenery. For example, this movie boasts the marvels of Q Branch such as Little Nellie, the gyrocopter.  Also, Blofeld's secret base was amazing.(it roughly cost 1 million to make, equal to  the budget of Dr. NO).  This film has been considered one of the weaker bond films, but all the bond films can't be exactly alike.

First of all, an evil organization SPECTRE is taking over russian and american space shuttles. So bond is off to Japan to find out what's going on. He meets tons of women, villains, and henchman along the way. Although Sean Connery looks a little tired, that isn't why we get movies anyways. Their is much action (fist fights, gunfights, aerial helicopter battle, and a grand finale machinegunfight in a supervolcano launch pad set). This movie has it all.

415180,4,630202028X,"At the height of a cold war threatening to heat up, Russian and American spacecraft vanish after making contact with a mysterious spacecraft. Predictably, each country blames the other for an outrageous act of space piracy and of war. The British disagree, sending in the one man who can find the truth, save the world, fall in love and get the best vodka martini all at the same time: James Bond.
Heading for the islands of Japan, Bond uncovers a SPECTRE conspiracy to trigger WWIII, discovering a secret space-port in a dormant volcano and finally meeting the horribly scarred ""No. 1"" himself, Ernst Blofeld. Never seen by face, (""Thunderball"" and ""From Russia with Love""), Blofeld actually looks a lot like british actor Donald Pleasance. Despite the ""unmasking"", Pleasance uses an utterly cold to preserve the malevolent mystery of the evil empire's capstone. With the help of an army of modern ninjas (armed with cigarette-rocket launchers) and on the brink of nuclear war, Bond stages an epic assault on SPECTRE.
I'm surprised that this film gets such lukewarm response from fans or even non-fans. Though providing more material for bond-parody than, say ""From Russia with Love"", YOLT doesn't sink to camp. Though the Blofeld in this film takes himself so seriously that his was the model for Dr. Evil, it's still a chilling performance one that survives even Austin Powers. Bond seems even more vulnerable than he did in ""Dr. No"" while the Asian locations only keep him off balance, unacclimated.

I see this Bond as being perhaps the most visually stunning of all of the collection with one of the most powerful soundtracks. If stunning visual imagery with magnificanet operatic background music does it for you, then you will love this movie. If you want a great plot and dark suspense, go for From Russia With Love.

415183,4,630202028X,"This was the fifth in the Bond series, released in 1967.  Producer Albert ""Cubby"" Broccoli had quite a challenge on his hands outdoing the runaway success of ""Thunderball"".  He undertook to surpass it by increasing the budget, trying more elaborate gadgets and stunts (an ultralight heavily armed one man helicopter being chased by 4 other helicopters), gargantuan sets (a launch pad inside a volcano) and exotic locations (Japan).  At almost $10 million (that's about $50 million in today's dollars), this was one of the highest budgeted films at that time.  The launch pad set alone cost over $1 million to build.  Despite great box office results, ($110 Million worldwide in 1967 dollars) it fell short of Cubby's ambitions to exceed ""Thunderball"" financially ($140 Million worldwide) and it proved to be lackluster among the early Bond films.
Although having established himself as a pop icon in his 007 roles, Sean Connery was tired of being James Bond.  Before the release of this film, he announced his intention to retire from the role.  His lack of enthusiasm was evident throughout the film and his onscreen demeanor lacked verve.  He didn't even show much interest in the love scenes, looking more bored than passionate.  The critics declared that this would be the end of his career and the end of James Bond films, probably the worst twin predictions in the history of film.  As it turns out, Connery returned to the role twice more in 1971 (Diamonds Are Forever) and 1983 (Never Say Never Again).
I have a great deal of respect for Sean Connery, indeed he is one of my favorite actors.  His Bond films set a standard that was never equaled by any of the actors that followed.  However, his performance in this film displayed so much ennui that it bordered on unprofessional.
This film had all the elements necessary to make it one of the better Bond films.  It finally gave a face to Blofeld, and though the choice of Donald Pleasence was roundly criticized, I liked him in the role.  The story was intriguing.  Astronauts and their spacecraft were being abducted by a rogue predator ship that was gobbling them up whole.  Bond was dispatched to find out who was behind the plot.  The screenplay written by Roald Dahl was full of clever double entendres like Aki's (Akiko Wakabayashi) great line just as Bond swept her into his arms, ""I think I will enjoy very much serving under you.""  It had majestic locations and great photography.  However, the elements didn't gel, mostly because of Connery's Bond fatigue.
The DVD contains a good featurette that gives some interesting retrospective looks at the difficulties making the film and insight into what the producers were trying to accomplish.
Overall, this was a good Bond film, although it could have been much better but for Connery's malaise.  Still, the story was stronger than contemporary Bond films, which have resorted to nonstop action and visual effects with flimsy scripts.  I rated it a 7/10.  If you want to see Connery at his best, see ""Goldfinger"" or ""From Russia With Love"".",981244800,,3056,4.881782945736434

People's disbelief was suspended from a much higher ceiling in those days! The storyline is a big improvement on the book which was very low-key and wabi sabi compared to the wonderful idea of a satellite gobbling rocket hiding out in a Volcano ( I think the original story concerned someone growing poisonous flowers in his garden.). This is one film that Austin Powers could never touch because it's so wonderfully far-fetched already. With its ninjas and svelte Japanese maidens slipping in and out of kimonos, this movie is largely responsible for getting me hooked on Japan.",979516800,,739,4.826771653543307
415185,4,630202028X,"YOLT was supposed to be Sean Connery's last official Bond movie (after Lazenby's negative response, Connery came back for Diamonds are Forever), and the producers really decided to pack this one in full. The title song (by Nancy Sinatra) and John Barry score are some of the best in the franchise. The location (Japan) is exotic, and the sets are on a grand-scale level (an inactive volcano which can house a rocket ship, complete with monorail system). A top-notch writer was hired for the screenplay (Roald Dahl),and the script is loaded with exciting gun battles and action sequences. Also included in the movie are some beautiful new Bond girls and the promise of James Bond dying, marrying, becoming Japanese, and meeting Blofeld face to face. By all accounts, YOLT should have been one of the best and most memorable Bond films, providing Connery with a graceful exit from the series.
But somewhere along the line, YOLT fumbled and never regained its momentum. Yes the script is filled with action sequences, including a chopper battle in mid-air and a fight at the docks, but to accomdate these sequences the script goes into illogical territory. For example, early on in the film Bond goes to visit a contact named Henderson, only for Henderson to be killed. Bond sneaks back w/the killer, and just *happens* to find a safe in the wall. The alarm sounds, and he just *happens* to grab a set of documents which provide a negative and vital information. Aki, a competent Japanense agent, is killed towards the end of the film and quickly replaced by a new girl whos name isn't even mentioned (Kissy in the credits), all for the sake of sneaking one more Bond girl into the film. Also, Bond attempts to disguise himself as an astronaut and sneak aboard the rocket. What good would this have done? What did he think he could possibly accomplish in space? Connery's performance is also wooden. It doesn't have the charm of either his earlier performances or the humour of his later performance in Diamonds. I understand he was being hounded by the press at this time and desperately wanted to finish this film and quit, but he really should've been able to do a better job.
Complaints aside thou, YOLT still manages to entertain, moreso than most of the latter entries in the series. The script is illogical, but at least its fast-paced and rapid-fire all the way to the end. The sense of Bond political-incorrectness is rampant too, with lines like 'in japan, men come first, women come second.' These were the classic lines that made Bondmania, and YOLT also happens to represent the last of the films where Bondmania was truly part of the culture.
Final score? Rent YOLT. Buy YOLT. It's more mindless action than plot, but at least you get your moneys worth, and its both Connery and Japanese style all the way.",978134400,,2817,4.774590163934426

Pleasence is one of the reasons for the disappointment of this film, as he gives a bland, unsatisfying appearance as Blofeld, and the central plot is the other main reason. I think the creator of such characters as Willa Wonka and the Grand High witch along with many others could have created a more satisfying SPECTRE scheme than the hijacking of space capsules. However, I still insist that YOLT is a fantastic action film and the acting, for the most part, is not bad.

415188,3,630202028X,"""You Only Live Twice"" is the last consecutive Connery Bond film and after viewing the film several times you begin to see why.  Released in 1967, James Bond #5 has Agent 007 venture through a tepid plot in Japan to avert World War III.  On paper, I'm sure this premise seemed great and I'm told that Ian Fleming's original novel was a really good read.  However, the film suffers from a slow pace and Connery's boredom.
In Connery's previous Bond epics and even in ""Diamonds Are Forever"", Connery always gave 007 a fun twinkle.  He was an agent with a licence to kill but you got the feeling that Connery was having a blast playing James Bond.  In ""You Only Live Twice"" you don't get that.  Bond seems bored and even a little annoyed.
The plot is good enough.  SPECTRE steals both a NASA Gemini capsule and a Russian spacecraft to start a war between the two super powers.  Bond is sent to Japan to investigate and meets up with two Asian lovelys and a team of ninjas. That's pretty cool.  The only problem is all this seems routine now; the exotic locales, gorgeous women and gadgetry are all here but there's no sense of spark or even originality.  This adventure owes a lot to the success of ""Thunderball"".
The adventure is saved by the film's third reel where Bond infiltrates a SPECTRE stronghold in a dead volcano.  This set is amazing.  By this point the action heats up and Bond finally begins to lighten up and do what he does best; save the world with class.
Connery retired from MI6 after this film but returned in ""Diamonds Are Forever"".  He was far more Bond in that installment than he was here.  It is unfortunate that he didn't stay around longer to star in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"".",974592000,,1708,4.485436893203883

415210,4,630202028X,"You Only Live Twice, film number 6 in the series and number 5 for Sean Connery, is unarguably one of the most exciting and entertaining Bond films.  007 travels to Japan to investigate the disappearence of U.S. and Russian space shuttles and in doing so comes face to face for the first time with one of the best Bond villains, Ernst Stavro Blofeld (played by Donald Pleasance).  Blofeld has a ""secret volcano lair"" that he has been operating from to capture both space shuttles.  Bond's job, of course, is to stop him.  With the best aerial fight scene of any 007 flick, this movie packs a heck of a lot of action even if it  does lack the deeper plots of Goldfinger and Thunderball.
YOLT was Connery's second to last official Bond film, he returned for Diamonds are Forever in 1971, and for a remake of Thunderball in 1983 for Never Say Never Again.
YOLT is the most mocked Bond movie in terms of Austin Powers, and by watching the viewer will discover many jokes from the original Austin Powers that he/she may not have discovered.

415211,4,630202028X,"""You Only Live Twice"" is the fifth entry of the James Bond series produced by Harry Saltzman and Cubby Broccoli and of course Sean Connery starring as the sauve secret agent. After the incredible box office success of ""Thunderball"", the producers were understandably worried about how the next film could top it. The response was to place Bond in a larger than life setting on a mission with the highest stakes.
The story opens with a US spacecraft in earth orbit when suddenly it is captured by a second spacecraft of unknown origins. This being the height of the Cold War, the American government assumes that Russia is at fault, which Russian officials deny. If anything happens to the next spacecraft, it will mean nuclear war. However, the British are certain that Russia is not at fault and that in fact the rocket that capture the US spacecraft has landed near Japan. The British will send their best agent to discover the true agents of this provocation, the only problem is that agent, James Bond, has just been killed by hitmen in Hong Kong...
The production pulls out all the stops in this Bond adventure. Nearly all of ""You Only Live Twice"" is set in 1960's Japan and in fact the setting is actually considered a character in the plot with its blend of ancient and modern cultures. The cast is also a blend of European and Japanese actors. Tetsuro Tamba was an inspired choice for the role of JSS Head Tiger Tanaka and Akiko Wakabayashi and Mie Hama were excellent as the Bond girls in this outing. Karin Dor was good as the female villian Helga Brandt but Donald Pleasance and Teru Shimada were slightly disappointing in their roles of Blofeld and the Japanese industrialist Osato. Of course the regular cast of characters M, Q, and Miss Moneypenny (played by Bernard Lee, Desmond Llewelyn, and Lois Maxwell) put in their usual fine performances. In addition to the generally fine cast, the film also boast one of the largest and at that time one of the most expensive sets in film history.
""Your Only Live Twice"" seems to have all the right ingredients: James Bond on a mission of a lifetime, set in an exotic land, with an excellent title sequence and a beautiful title song, several great car and air chases, great fights, the largest and perhaps best firefights ever in the Bond series. Yet, during its initial release in 1967, ""You Only Live Twice"" seem to have disappointed critics despite box office receipts that nearly matched that of ""Thunderball"". Many critics felt that Sean Connery was tired of the role and it showed on film. In later years, once moviegoers had seen some substandard Bond films, the opinion about ""You Only Live Twice"" had improved greatly.
This reviewer believes that ""You Only Live Twice"" is an excellent Bond movie but it is not as good as the previous three outings (From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, and Thunderball"". The main problem is the concept of using the setting of Japan as a character in the story. Although the scenes that acquaint viewers with Japan and its culture are very good, they unfortunately tend to slow the story down at times. In addition, Pleasence's Blofeld is not the same character we would expect from earlier Bond stories and it is a shame that of Blofeld's henchman Hans and the beautiful Helga Brandt did not have bigger roles in the script. Today's audiences may find the outer space special effects very primitive. But, all in all, it is still an enjoyable movie to watch.
The MGM Special Edition DVD contains an excellent widescreen print of the film and lots of extra features. The two documentaries, one on the making of the film and the other about the Bond film titles which spotlights Maurice Binder are interesting to watch and very informative. If you have only seen this film on TV, it is highly recommended that you see the widescreen version, preferably with this DVD on a large screen TV. Once you do, you will never want to see it any other way again.
Although ""You Only With Twice"" was not Sean Connery's best effort as James Bond, it is still a very good one and one you should not miss.",972259200,3,4085,4.682892906815021

415214,3,630202028X,"In the fifth installment of the Bond movie series the script no longer stays near to the plot of the novel. Since YOLT only In Her Majesty's  Secret Service stays close to the original plot. After Goldfinger and  Thunderball Bond had become an icon and certain ingredients were considered  needed in a Bond film. However, this caused the plot to suffer heavily as  the film makers have to make the story up from scratch with limited time on  their hands. If it wasn't a Bond movie I'd have to give 2 stars only. On  the plus side we have the first look at villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld. The  way he was introduced in the previews movies, up until the end of YOLT,  when we get to see his scarred face, is outright brilliant. Another Bond  classic is Little Nellie, the one-man helicopter. Also, the Ken Adam sets  are more impressive than ever, with SPECTRE's volcano lair and the japanese  ninja camp. All in all, for a Bond film it's not very exciting, not that  funny, but as part of the whole series it does the job.",965001600,,1019,4.419354838709677

Plus, there are a lot of suprises during  the movie to look out for, so watch and listen carefully. Hope you enjoy!",964483200,,292,4.105263157894737
415216,5,630202028X,"Many times this movie has been criticized for carrying the reliance on gadgetry to the extreme. It does have many gadgets such as the safe decoder, Little Nellie, the lipstick bomb, and some of the ninja weapons. This time,though, the producers had every right make this another gadget-laden movie because of the huge success of Thunderball.
I've read many of the Ian Fleming Bond books and this was the first movie that did not follow the book at all. There are only two things that remain constant between the book and the movie: the Japenese location and the characters. This is understandable because in the series of novels, On Her Majesty's Secret Service is before YOLT. In the book YOLT, Bond is a wreck because of his wife's death in OHMSS and M even considers firing him. In the movie series, Bond hadn't been married or widowed. For the screenplay, producers bring in the noted writer Roald Dahl to create a film with expensive special effects and large-scale sets.
The film is director Lewis Gilbert's Bond debut and the first time Peter Hunt does the second unit directing instead of the editing. During the end of production, Sean Connery announced his retirement from the series but would later come back for Diamonds Are Forever. Connery said that he was sick of Bondmania and all of the reporters looking for interwiews.
THE ASSIGNMENT After American and a Soviet spacecrafts vanish, M assigns James Bond to Japan, where he suspects that another party might be fabricating the conflict. After faking his own death, Bond connects with the Japanese Secret Service. He is then trained as a ninja, 'married' to another agent, Kissy Suzuki( whose name isn't even mentioned in the film) and disguised as a worker on a Japanese island. Bond and Kissy discover that SPECTRE is launching rockets that can capture other spacecrafts and return them to Blofeld's magnificent lair inside a volcano. The end of the movie is very exciting when many ninjas attack the volcano lair and destroy it. Blofeld escapes and Bond and Kissy are left in a raft.
This film contains the best music and some of the best editing in the series. I own every Bond movie and with me this one ranks as one of the top 6. From Russia, With Love; On Her Majesty's Secret Service; Goldfinger; Tomorrow Never Dies; You Only Live Twice; GoldenEye

415247,3,630202028X,"WEll, that is what You Only Live Twice came across. Leave it to one time Bond scriptwriter Roald Dahl to write a long drawn out story, and to make ill use of the women in the movie. Karin Dor's Helga Brandt was just a  Fiona Volpe clone who failed to measure up to her predeccessor. As good as  the two Japanese Bond girls are in this film, Aki and Kissy Suzuki, Aki was  knocked off way too late in the film and Kissy, when she DID appeared, was  given way too little to do. They should have change the script and just  combined the Aki/Kissy character into one.
You Only Live Twice emerged as  the weakest of the Connery films that followed GOldfinger. Too bad, Akiko  Wakabayashi and Mie Hama deserved better.",958348800,,712,4.348484848484849
415248,2,630202028X,"This film was disappointing. Definitely you should rent it, but don't buy it unless you have made it your goal to own all the Bonds.",954806400,2,132,4.32
415249,3,630202028X,"""You Only Live Twice"" is far from a boring film, that's for sure. However, there are many limiting factors. For example, SPECTRE are trying to start a nuclear war between the two major superpowers, the Soviet  Union and the USA, by apparently stealing their space capsules in flight  (!). But there are many easier ways to achieve this: why not just fire a  nuclear rocket into New York? Ernst Stavro Blofeld (played by Donald  Pleasance) doesn't appear until the last 20 minutes, and when he does, he  is an over-the-top appearance with a huge scar down one side of his face:  did they really need to do that? No. Plus, Sean Connery's heart really  doesn't seem to be in it any more, he just fires his Walther PPK when he  has to, he just decks a few henchmen when he has to, etc etc. Also, you  help but feel a tremendous sense of closure when Aki, the leading girl, was  bumped off two-thirds into the movie. Her replacement, Kissy Suzuki, is a  sad excuse for a Bond girl. (Her name is never mentioned in the entire  film, for God's sake!) That's the criticisms. YOLT still manages to have  some entertaining aspects: for example the Japanese setting, the fight at  Osato's HQ, the unforgettable ""Little Nellie"" sequence, and the  final shootout inside Blofeld's giant rocket base-disguised-as-volcano  hideout. Pity these are let down by some poor special effects. Although You  Only Live Twice is one of the weaker Sean Connery efforts, the same cannot  be said about the soundtrack. Nancy Sinatra provides a haunting opening  number that translates into excellent background music. So, in summary YOLT  contains some good bits, but these are greater than the sum of their parts.",948672000,3,1685,4.784722222222222
415250,4,630202028X,"I love this picture.  The previous reviewers had problems with it.  It has everything a Bond picture should have.  The scenery is magnificent, the gadgets are up to standard, the production quality is as good as the  previous Bond efforts, the villain is a typical jerk, and the title song  sung by Nancy Sinatra is the best I've ever heard in a Bond picture.",944956800,18,359,4.546875
415251,4,630202028X,"Perhaps it is because I find Asian women attractive, but You Only Live Twice is my favorite of the Sean Connery Bond films. Sure, the plot might be a tad absurd, but let's face it, the plots in all of the Bond films  strain credibility.  People watch the Bond movies for the gadgets, the  girls, the villains and the climactic finales.  You Only Live Twice has all  the ingredients for a great Bond flick.  YOLT is interesting because it  introduces the viewer, and Bond, to Japan and its culture.  It is the first  film in the series features space travel, even though Bond himself remains  earthbound.  Donald Pleasence as Blofeld is one of the best villains of the  entire series.  And Akiko Wakabayashi as Aki, is one of the most attractive  of all of the Bond girls, perhaps second only to Claudine Auger in  Thunderball.  My biggest complaint with YOLT is that Aki gets killed off.  Otherwise, this is one of the best entries in the series and one of the few  that I watch again and again when it is on television.",944870400,2,1020,4.48087431693989
415252,2,630202028X,"Thunderball was more slow-moving than this one,yet,this one is more boring. Pleasence is ok as Blofeld,but far to slimy to be believable. For one,you are not totally pleased with Connery`s performance. He goes on  routine far to much!
High points: Little Nellie,Tiger Tanaka.
Low  points: the plot.",944265600,,298,5.319148936170213
415253,3,630202028X,"Sorry, but this one was a big disappointment. There are elements of the film that are outstanding, other elements that make so little sense it overshadows the rest. First of all the plot was ridiculous, stealing  spacecraft in order to spark a war? There must be a million easier and less  expensive ways to start a war between the superpowers. Trying to hide a  lanch pad in a volcano? Come on, lets at least stay on the fringe of  believeability. Had the producers stayed with Flemings original plot line  this movie would have easily been another From Russia With Love.  The  exotic locations, Aki and Kissy (who by the way NEVER once had her name  mentioned in the movie) Tiger Tanaka, and hell Little Nellie was a cute  touch, but the rest? PU. Aki was a great Bond girl, tough and smart. She  saved Bonds bacon, as well as lured him into Tigers little trap, laughing  at the ease by which she controlled the situation. She was such a great  character, to this day I get choked up at her death scene. Kissy Suzuki,  hell, what can I say? This is biziness Bond-san Great line, great delivery  from a smart, confident and beautiful character. Kissy and Aki set the  standard for the non-bimbo Bond Girls. Kissy's part was significantly  downplayed from the original story, little remained of her but the name and  occupation. Too bad this movie went like this. It was probably  a sign of  the times, space exploration was in the publics eye, and this attempted to  cash in on that.  To Barbra Broccoli: Give me a chance, I will remake this  and do it right!",943142400,3,1560,4.5359712230215825
7819699,3,630202028X,"Its been so long since Ive seen this, the only thing I could remember was the volcano with the opening pit. So it was a lot like watching a new movie but with some pretty hokey stunts and some hilarious continuity gaps. This said, the set of the villain's space base was pretty impressive for the time. The violence is pretty tame by todays standards, so too Bonds philandering. I was pleased to see such a positive take on Japan so soon after the war. The plot is deliciously over the top but that's Bond all-round. It was entertaining enough on a quiet Saturday night.",1526256000,,570,4.438095238095238
