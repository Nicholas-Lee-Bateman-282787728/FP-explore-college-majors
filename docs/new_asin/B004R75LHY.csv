4458432,1,B004R75LHY,"I am an animal lover at heart, but this movie bored me to death. I was under the impression we were going to see Nenette interacting with trainers or hearing the story of her. Instead you are watching people talking about Nennette while she sites looking depressed behind a pane of glass",1409788800,2,287,4.538461538461538
4458433,5,B004R75LHY,I loved it and have watched it twice and I'm sure  I will watch it more times over the year.  Charming..,1409616000,,104,3.9047619047619047
4458434,1,B004R75LHY,"Very sad to see these animals so bored, in a small cage with nothing living except these poor animals, nothing interesting except a few ropes and plastic bins. Just angles everywhere, hard metal blocks and no room to run.",1409529600,,221,4.6923076923076925
4458435,4,B004R75LHY,"A little slow at times, but well worth watching. Animal lovers will appreciate it. Netnette is a very special creature.",1392163200,,119,5.0

4458437,1,B004R75LHY,"Initially, this movie seemed to be stuck on the first scene, until I saw the ape blink. That is how dull it was. For the most part you are looking at an ape who is looking back at you. Occasionally some school children or other attendees at the zoo would appear and harass  Nenette. That was pretty much the extent of the ""action"" . Oh yes, the back story was something to do with Nenette having a son who was now full grown living in the cage with her because the keepers thought he might be a good companion. From what I could see, Nenette treated him as she treated us, blank stare. I hated this movie. I watched it because I love orang's.",1376352000,3,642,4.17741935483871
4458438,3,B004R75LHY,"This movie starts out slow then decelerates. I found myself more interested in the orangutans' caretakers than in the animals. Those who care for these primates really, really love their work. Hearing some of the care givers, we never see any one but the apes, tell of the interactions between them and the orangs is very endearing. They love these animals but whether the animals reciprocate this love is anybody's guess. I personally don't like zoos but in this case I think the orangutans would most likely be extinct if they weren't in the zoo (I may be wrong about this). If you like apes and zoos this is the movie for you otherwise give it a pass.",1361836800,,654,4.5508474576271185
4458439,5,B004R75LHY,"What dies in the caged animal,what mysterious animal otherness we will never see because its wilderness has become zoo-bound?This documentary is half a self-portait,half a recognition of some profound otherness,mystery in the animal,we would like to become. This orangutan a Mona Lisa for our sketches and reflections,an ape of our essence. As Philbert says,he surrenders control as there's so much you don't know about what you're doing. Nenette retains her mystery,hence no animal experts are allowed in. The questions are left open,so the viewers have to participate. Behind the thick glass of our anxiety we may speculate what really would happen if we came face to face. What effect do the passing images,sounds of people have on the ape?Do they die because she is encaged and can't use them?Everything pours in towards this staggering silent emptiness in the beast's heart. The lack of the need to fend for itself to find its own food and shelter have prolonged its life,made its despondent flesh sag,depressed its features. Was her brain in a deep sleep of autumnal hibernation?Attenborough found more meaning in relating to gorillas in the wild than anything else he'd experienced. Philbert's trick is to just film the orangutans.

Having been taken from,the jungles of Borneo at age 3 and stayed for 39 years in the Jardin de Plantes zoo,she had got through 3 husbands and had 4 children,only one of which remained with her to ward off loneliness as she was too old to mate. In her 4.30 pm meals of yoghurt and tea they had put in birth control pills,as they were not sure of incest. Thoughtful about his craft and cinema in general,Philbert says: `The beauty and importance of a film aren't linked to the subject. You can make a bad film from a so-called ""important"" subject, but you can also make a great film from a theme that seems tiny or banal.'In our own cosy cells was our humanity similarly caged?Caged animals sense the hundreds of inquisitive looks,and it has an effect on them. Animals in their lairs who aren't aware of being watched,shy creatures lying with half-closed eyes,licking their claws and thinking,with all their original terror and wildness. The stealthy steps in the dead of night,the sighs from boughs,the eerieness of the forest,cries from passing birds,the wind,smell of blood,thunder in the sky,the spirit of wild nature inside the creature. Butwhat we hear are the voices of the many visitors who pass comment on her every day,revealing more about themselves than the object of their gaze. This gem captures themes of privacy,captivity and the relationship between observer and observed. Nenette's singular gaze makes us look at our lives in comparison. Is our species doomed too? What does it say about us that we put our closest relatives in the animal kingdom in cages? Or that we let them face extinction in the wild in the first place?",1327536000,,2880,4.987525987525988
4458440,5,B004R75LHY,"... but with English subtitles.  Being a person who loves animals and can spend hours at the zoo, I found this DVD interesting, if a bit slow paced but that is the nature of orangutans.  Sometimes it's like being in the French zoo, complete with the noisy kids and reflections off the glass.  Other times it is a quite, intimate look at them, on both sides of the glass.  Nenette is an old lady at 40 years old and the focus is on her; but I found some of the statements unbelievable, such as women in the jungle might be raped by an orangutan in the wild.  I guess these legends are of interest to some but I found them silly.  I would only recommend this for the zoo lover who likes to take their time at the zoo.  Great picture and sound quality.

My library copy was missing the second DVD but a great review of both films can be found by searching for Glenn Erickson DVD Savant.",1325980800,,883,4.183431952662722
8438729,5,B004R75LHY,"Important film that considers the perspective of the caged animal being the object of constant observation by humans, rather than that of the humans. Some of the comments drew interesting parallels to the human condition, sucha as the woman who wonders if Nenette misses the country she comes from  (""I miss mine, too""). To the caretaker who comments that to Nenette, we (humans) all merge -- not unlike how we tend to view other species.

This film is a great opportunity to discuss empathy with children. The number of comments who say it's boring is a sad reflection of how to many, animals are here merely to entertain us. There is so much we can learn from Nenette -- about her, animals, and ourselves -- if we open our minds and hearts.",1520812800,,742,4.613636363636363
8438730,5,B004R75LHY,"I could not watch this as planned, its in French with captions, fine for me who watches all things with CC, I am hard of hearing. I wanted to share this with my Seniors with dementia and Alzheimer's, some can no longer read and others cannot see very well. I will watch it myself at home, it looks like a 5 star documentary from the little I saw.",1467504000,,346,4.102941176470588
8438731,2,B004R75LHY,boring  7 minutes of listening to french folks speak about the Orangutang behind the glass.,1466985600,,91,5.066666666666666
8438732,2,B004R75LHY,Very isolated filming. There was a huge opportunity to show some life in these animals. They seemed depressed compared to other documentary films I have seen. Nenette was quite old but there were others that could have been showcased. The filming was close up and didn't offer much in the way of their environment. Small enclosure might be why they did this. Glad it was free. So sad the animals were in such a dreary enclosure.,1466380800,,428,4.644736842105263
8438733,5,B004R75LHY,Interesting and informative.,1466208000,,28,8.666666666666666

8438736,2,B004R75LHY,Boring- hard to follow,1457568000,,22,4.75
8438737,1,B004R75LHY,This is boring and very sad. I normally can stand a lot of slow paced things but this was just too much for even me to watch for very long. It was also very hard to see the poor conditions that the animals are living in the small space you can see how sad Nanette is. Do not have children watch this as it is very sad they is a man making fun of the poor ape in this it is mean.,1436572800,,378,3.6219512195121952
