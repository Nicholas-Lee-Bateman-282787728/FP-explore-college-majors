2151749,4,B00000I4VI,"No expense was spared to authenticate the historical period earth 23th century Austria. The architecture, costuming and depictions of town and rural life was accurate in all details. The plot and story lines were engaging and interesting. The characters were believable and the movie, though long, did not drag. However, I believe there were some minor mistakes made by this movie's non-Catholic writers or producers. The scene where a peasant (the man who wanted to be the next executioner) enters a monastery sanctuary to steal the golden ""heart"" - ciborium, is highly unlikely to have ever entered the mind of the average - even greedy, individual. The Church was an integral part of the medieval man's/woman's life, that even for the hardened sinner, this would have been an unpardonable sin and sacrilege. It made for drama, but historically, very unlikely to have happened at all. And, while the archbishop was depicted as corrupt, and who fathered the two main characters, this aimed more at anti- Catholic bias, rather than a sin of done clerics that certainly no one could deny probably has happened. The depiction of the civil courts condemning the heretic was historically true, as the Church itself only weighed the theological merits in heresy cases, On an attempt to reveal the corruption within the Catholic Church extant then, and it did exist, I think an otherwise use fine film was marred by some inaccuracies. Overall, it was a very well done film, and I would recommend it to Protestant & Catholic alike.",1463702400,,1524,5.003937007874016

2151862,5,B00000I4VI,"Wow, This movie was intense and maybe a little to real in what was going on at the time of the inquisition... I was looking for some epic Medieval movie I had never seen before and stumbled into this incredible and heart renching movie.  Both my brother in law and I were mesmorized at how well and realistic everything about this movie was... It left me Heavy Hearted in the vain of Mystic River... but an incredible movie worth watching... If You love Medieval History and incredible cinematic filming... I was looking for a reason to think this was a B grade never before heard of movie and instead it sucked me into the story so much I had to see it all.  Its sometimes a hard to watch movie due to its subject matter and reality of what such people were faced with during that time in histrory... All the actors, sets and Clothing was so authentic... it put me in the times...and feeling for the characters involved in this film.  Its a tough movie to watch ..but I think its an absolute worth-while film.  It kept me thinking about what I just saw even after the movie was over.  If you can't deal with the violence... then you might pick something lighter to view.  this is for the tough hearted and historical buffs...and people not afraid to watch tragic films.

2151871,4,B00000I4VI,"I was happier with film than I thought I would be.  Two boys grow up together in an orphanage.  At a young age they are separated by the church.  Georg would go on to be a Prior and Martin a Captain in the Army.

Fate draws the two back together.  Martin falls for the executioners daughter, Anna, and leaves.  His company is slaughtered with Martin being the only survivor.  He comes back to Anna to find she's had a son and been promised to the new executioner.  That doesn't go over well with Martin.

Martin asks his friend Georg to marry them.  Georg refuses and thus begins the rift between the two.  There are a couple surprises in the movie including the revelation of Martin's father and a major betrayal.

The colors are muted befitting the feeling of the era.  The church is held in such esteem that it can do no wrong nor can those acting on its behalf.  All in all, an enjoyable way to spend 105 minutes.",1439510400,,917,4.317647058823529

I really wish there were a place that showed the rating for one thing that would help a bit. I had to skip over the sex part as my 12 year old was watching... It was really not all that graphic so not much to skip thankfully. The movie itself had a sad ending to be honest it could have had a slight change in it just to make it a slightly better ending and not leave you with a feeling of sadness and just loss. Things did not turn out anything like this for the people that say this is historically correct it is not. People did not rescue others like that history is much harsher to be blunt about things. I will give the film some good points the acting was good the quality was good the swords very good every part of the set well other than a few props here and there were correct.,1436572800,,910,3.978142076502732

And it showed a strong man rather than a bumbling incompetent that is so common in the movies today.  He gave his life for his wife and son.

The acting - by well known, top-not actors - is well executed, subtle, and expressive.  And far from dragging, or developing slowly, tension grows from the first moments.  It is gripping.  It is about character, power, lies, and treachery.  The only valid reason I can think of for rating it less than 4 or 5 is dislike of the story.  Well, unfortunately, it is historically appropriate.

The officials of the Inquisition were ambushed on the road and killed and the Vatican sent no more of them into Germany. This tale tells part of the story but centers it's focus on a lone soldier who falls in love with the local headman's daughter and takes on the job after her father dies. He's a principled man who hates his work and eventually things don't go so well for him. Lots of swords-a-swinging and heads-a-flying and if that's what you like, then this is the movie for you.",1425945600,,877,4.289156626506024

But, as is all to true of Hollywood, they somehow couldn't resist all the unnecessary gore and horror.  The beheading scene is badly done and full of useless blood spraying everywhere as the crowd acts delighted.  The scene where the woman got her tongue pulled out was over the top and I had trouble sleeping that night due to the PTSD it caused. The scene where they burn all those people to death was another one.  If you have PTSD or any kind of of anxiety or stress issues skip this one and all the pointless gore.  I know that this kind of thing actually happened in those days, but we don't need to witness first hand to appreciate the horror of those times.  This one needs a remake by someone who can tell the story without the blood and screaming.",1400371200,3,844,4.337579617834395

2151979,5,B00000I4VI,This little known film was surprisingly good.  I love the medieval age and this was well-done and took me back to that time.

2151995,4,B00000I4VI,"This is a serious, realistic drama, so if you're looking for a swashbuckling, swordfighting adventure, look elsewhere. However, it is a movie well worth watching for its intellegent evaluation of the era's dark political and religious atmosphere, and one with noteworthy characters that are believable, significant, and well-acted by a talented cast. The pace is slow but not plodding, and the cinematography is more than adequate to enable the viewer to feel they are THERE. If you're a history buff familiar with this era of European history then you'll find little to nothing wrong with this film, and you will enjoy watching the character's moral conflicts revealed and/or resolved.",1229472000,15,686,5.302752293577981

I might also suggest a pbs documentary about Gallileo as a great man who was involved in mankind crossing over to the age of reason.",1214265600,7,503,4.142857142857143
2151997,4,B00000I4VI,"A surprisingly good film that develops around the hard times that followed the Lutheran christian reform. The movie keeps moving thanks to the obvious violent reaction of Catholics, in a way not far different from any other religion fanatical today. The movie is filmed on a nice medieval location and gives some nice history hints of those times near the Austrian alps. While most actors are not well known they do very descent jobs. The only reason why I don't give it five stars is because the movie slows down a bit, particularly during the first half.",1211068800,11,556,4.742268041237113

2151999,5,B00000I4VI,"I second the other reviewer's advisory on the description on the back of the box.  The story is about two men who grow up together in a monastery.  One becomes a soldier and ends up losing his status as such, when he marries a witch who'd borne him his son.  The other becomes the Prior in a monastery.

As you watch, you see the adversity between Catholics and heretics growing.  Zeal to get rid of all the heretics creates an almost unquenchable fire.  First, there are advisories.  Then there are bounties.  Finally, you better turn someone else in or the Church is coming after you.

The costuming, set, and acting is very real--perhaps too much so, but ""Shadow"" is good instruction for us in this time as to how a Holy War and Purge are conducted.  Very worthwhile film--but a difficult watch.",1180396800,33,798,4.556338028169014
2152000,5,B00000I4VI,"Shadow of the Sword, or the Headsman, depending on which name you go with, is  a great adventure about Europe's growing pains at the end of the dark ages. The Catholic Church is refusing to give up its exclusive ""trademark"" of God and Jesus, while the baptists are trying to return Christianity to the people. The story focuses on two men, orphans who were once best friends growing up in the local monastery. After they were separated, one became a Captain in the army, while the other became a friar in the Church. The soldier returns and, through a series of events, becomes the town executioner. Meanwhile, struggles within and without the Church set events in motion that will force both men to make decisions that will affect the rest of their lives.

The costumes and sets are fantastic, the story is gripping and the actors give compelling performances. I wasn't in the mood for this type of movie when I sat down to watch it, but after 20 minutes I was in it for the long haul. There were few scenes of excessive gore or unnecessary sexual content, but that's the price we pay with every movie made today.

There is one warning for DVD viewers out there. The write-up on the back of the box claimed the two friends grew up, one an executioner and one a mercenary. While watching the movie, I kept waiting to see how the (rather wimpy) friar would become a mercenary. He doesn't.
