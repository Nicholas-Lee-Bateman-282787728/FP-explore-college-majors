8719921,1,B00ZE4ZZZM,"Strange, low budget, and boring movie! Rented this from Redbox because I thought it was going to be like ""Coraline""- but it was awful. Waste of $1.50. My kids, ages 8 and 3 lost interest quickly and thought it was weird and didn't make sense. The singing snails were terribly annoying!!",1446940800,3,286,4.627450980392157
