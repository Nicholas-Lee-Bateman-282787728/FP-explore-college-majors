Richter has played the Tchaikovsky pieces on Olympia Vol 4 OCD 334, but I have never head him play the Rachmaninoff pieces before. In any case, while solo Tchaikovsky tends to be bland, for it seems he thought more in strings than in keyboard, Richter makes the most of what these are.

However, Richter's Rachmaninoff playing is stupendous. I was at once agog. I have many recordings of RIchter, but I had never hear heard him do these big pieces. He plays Rachmaninoff better than Rachmaninoff. The difficulty of the pieces and their complex structure seem to enliven him. He gets this huge sound, this magisterial melodic line. They are so beautiful.

Richter was as great a Schumann player as Gieseking, and this DVD offers two Blumenstuck Op. 19 duets for two hands, which I have never heard of before. They are played with the young Lyudmila Berlinskaya. She is a perfect match, and their body co-odination is delightful to behold. Schumann was a rich composer; his riches lay in a single vein, but in that vein he is priceless. Richter brings to him the same intestinal rhythm as to Rachmaninoff.

Richter, of course, is not a showy pianist, but he was quite kinetic at the keyboard. He loved this music. It was in his body to. He didn't look as though he loved his audiences, because he never appeared to play up to them while walking on or off or bowing. But the fact is, as we all know, he did love audiences. He simply was not interested in charming them personally. When I met him he was warm and happy and generous. So the aloof manner he has, entering and bowing and exiting, was a strategy merely, grounded in modesty, which was one of his chief characteristics; or you might say one of his chief vices. In any case it was a posture of self-protecttion, or, no, rather he was protecting the music he was about to perform.

The venues are in Moscow, some smaller, some splendid, but the notes don't say where. No booklets accompany these DVD reports.  The two DVDs, (this one and Sviatoslav Richter plays Beethoven & Chopin in Moscow) cover a big 10 October 1976 concert, this DVD including his encores, certain Schumann, the other DVD, his Chopin. Don't know why this was done, but it doesn't matter. What does matter is that you get a good sense of him, his intense involvement with the music, his infinite mastery, his power, his musicality. Some of the performances are made before he started performing with a score and a page-turner. He is 59 and in his 60s when these films were made not as rash he was in his 30s and 4os, but which of us is?

Richter was a world treasure! Like the pyramids he must be visited in person. These two DVDs allow us to do that, once again. And, of course, they are a must for all Richter Completists.",1452556800,4,2765,4.540160642570281
