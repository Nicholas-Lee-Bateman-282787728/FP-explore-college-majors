7669747,5,B01BW9NL2Q,"In the United States we use the term Eurotrash to describe the many outrageous, ill-conceived, and outlandish productions that seem to populate European opera houses. Opera directors think they know better than the composers what should happen on stage and impose all manner of interpretations, stage business, props, and even characters that do not appear in the original libretto and staging.

This production of Handels magnificent opera Giulio Cesare serves as a prime example of a wrong-headed approach. Where to begin? A mannequin of Cesare appears on stage for the first many scenes until Tolomeo in a burst of fury dismembers it, pulls out intestines which he drapes around his shoulders and the heart which he bites. Tolomeo is presented as a lascivious, tattooed punk who in one scene humps a pillow while watching a colleague harass Cornelia. In another scene he masterbates while looking at nude photos in a magazine, and toward the end of the opera he rapes his sister Cleopatra while singing an aria. There is a big green crocodile with a movable jaw on stage: a grieving Cornelia puts her head into the mouth as an act of desperation near the beginning of the opera and an imprisoned Cleopatras head is shoved into the mouth toward the end. A couple of big lizards also appear on stage. Sesto sings an aria while manipulating a rubber snake while a projected image in the background shows a real snake moving around, but at least this is related to his aria about a wounded snake. No camels, though.

At one point Cleopatra sings an aria astride a rocket and then flies up and off stage on the rocket. One of the finest soprano arias in the repertory is Pianger la sorte mia, and in this production the captured Cleopatra sings it while on her knees, with her hands tied behind her back, and with a sackyes, a sackcovering her entire head.

Have you heard enough? Yet this is just a sampling of the nonsense taking place on stage. Let's hope this production stays in Salzburg. So lets leave the production and move to the singers.

This is the most magnificently sung performance of Giulio Cesare that you are likely to hear ever. The German countertenor Andreas Scholl is in wonderful form both in singing and acting throughout the performance. Cecilia Bartoli sings Cleopatra so superbly that no other soprano could reach her heights. She gives phrase after phrase of beautiful, smooth, technically controlled singingnote perfect, I would sayno matter what is going on around her or what strange things she is doing herself. The mother-son duo of Cornelia and Sesto is taken here by the elegant mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter and the terrific countertenor Philippe Jaroussky. Individually and together they are simply magnificent, perhaps in their finest singing form. Cornelia sings throughout the opera while being harassed and manhandled by at least three characters. Tolomeo--the over-sexed punk--is sung very ably by countertenor Christophe Dumaux. Achilla is sung by Ruben Drole and Curio by Peter Kalmn, both in good form. In a bit of luxury casting, the countertenor Jochen Kowalski sensitively sings and acts the part of Nirena, for unexplained reasons changed from the male Nireno in the libretto to the female Nirena in this production. The orchestra, Il Giardino Armonico, plays top-notch Handel, and the conductor, Giovanni Antonini, keeps things on track and gives sensitive support to his singers. It is a tribute to the professionalism of the singers and musicians that they could perform so wonderfully in spite of the production.

This performance was recorded at the Salzburg Festival in 2012. Soon thereafter Decca announced that CD and DVD versions would go on sale soon, but for some reason it has taken four years for this DVD to appear. The CD version, as far as I can determine, has still not been released.

My advice to readers is to wait for the CD album so that you can savor the wonderful performances without having to sit through the dreadful production. If the CD version never appears, then you will want to buy the DVD, butI suggest  play it with your back to the TV screen and perhaps a libretto in your hands.",1463270400,23,4167,4.902127659574468

8751726,2,B01BW9NL2Q,"Handel is my favorite composer and Giulio Cesare is one of my favorites but this video recording is the worst version I own.  The staging is atrocious and musically it does not come close to competing with any of the other recordings.

The main problem is that Cesare is sung by a Counter-tenor instead of a mezzo soprano and Cleopatra is sung by a mezzo soprano instead of a soprano.  I realize that Cecilia Bartoli and Andreas Scholl are both big name stars but by changing the register of the singing, Cesare ends up having a higher voice than Cleopatra.  It just sounds wrong.

On a technical standpoint, the video also has flaws.  Every chapter break starts with a recitative, so you have to use the scan function of your Blu-ray player in order to get to the music.  The vocals are mixed at a higher volume than the orchestra which gives a less involving listening experience.  Also there are no Italian subtitles included for those who like to follow along with the music.

Im not sure what to say about the staging.  Is this supposed to be funny?  It is certainly ridiculous but I did not think it was funny or amusing.  I think many people will find it offensive and vulgar.

Although I am not usually a big fan of counter-tenors, Philippe Jaroussky and Christophe Dumaux both give excellent performances and they are they are the best thing about this video.  The conducting is good although I would have preferred that the volume of the orchestra was better integrated into the mix so you could hear it over the vocals.

My all-time favorite opera on video is the Giulio Cesare conducted by William Christie.  If you are interested in seeing a great opera on video, it is a much better choice than the one presented here.

I also own the CD versions conducted by Marc Minkowski and Rene Jacobs.  They are both so good, I cannot pick a favorite.  I suggest buying both.

They say that you cannot judge a book by the cover but in this case, you can judge the video by the photo on the cover.  If this looks like something you might like, then go ahead and give it a try.  Otherwise, I recommend buying the Giulio Cesare conducted by William Christie.",1505692800,,2159,4.510309278350515
8751727,5,B01BW9NL2Q,"Though I prefer audio CDs to DVDs of opera--the importance of acting in opera notwithstanding--this particular opera is well staged and presented. As with the Salzburg and other contemporary opera staging, it has been updated. In this case, the scene is WWII. I thought it came off very well.

Everyone is exceptionally good; and what a rare treat to find countertenors the center of attention. They prove their worth here.",1490227200,,423,5.042857142857143
8751728,5,B01BW9NL2Q,"This production is packed with so many superstars. The production is ""out there"", but it did not detract from the all around virtuosic performances of the artists. Would like to single a particular one as being uniquely outstanding, but they were all truly superb.",1488499200,,264,5.0227272727272725
8751729,5,B01BW9NL2Q,"By all means. I watched this performance on internet once, but I never thought that it would be released on Blue ray , until I saw it on Amazon, and ordered it right away, no hesitation at all. Jaroussky is amazing here , Anne Sophie von Otter the way she sings is so delicate and fine, Andreas Scholl great as usually, Cecilia Bartoli awsome as well. others singers great too. I did really enjoy it as the first time I saw it, BRAVO!!!",1488499200,,436,4.265060240963855

8751731,5,B01BW9NL2Q,"The problem with staging some baroque operas like Giulio Cesare is that they can seem like endless aria after aria, since there really isn't much happening.  I found that the modern staging here added greatly to the drama and comedy of this opera.  Yes, some will find it in bad taste, but I enjoyed most of the unusual touches that others have listed.  I loved the costumes, especially those of Cecilia Bartoli, who has about 6 different outfits.  She looks and sounds radiant here.  I also was impressed by the variety of the countertenors (4), of which 3 were especially notable.  Andreas Scholl has an elegant sound, perfectly suitable for his role as Cesare.  Christophe Dumaux as Tolomeo has an intense, thrilling voice, again matching his character's evil, vulgar persona.  Phillipe Jaroussky, playing the young Sesto, has a youthful, beautiful sound, and his Act one duet with Anne Sofie von Otter, playing his mother, Cornelia, is simply ravishing, his voice taking the higher tones in the harmonies, her lush mezzo taking the lower tones.  The acting is also very good by all parties, and the end of the opera is both wonderful and mildly shocking.  The singing is glorious, and for me, the modern production works.",1475280000,,1225,4.902912621359223
8751732,2,B01BW9NL2Q,"This was superbly sung, but the production itself was totally idiotic especially the final scene. There was  no chemistry between Caesar and Cleopatra which rather defeats the purpose.",1473811200,3,184,5.571428571428571
8751733,5,B01BW9NL2Q,"Almost unbelievably great singing, with superb orchestra support and direction.  Normally I avoid ""Euro trash"" concept productions, so my idea was to listen to this with the screen turned off.  Occasionally I'd glace at the screen, as I don't seem to be able to do sound-only, and to my chagrin, the acting I saw was superb, and the staging, in some odd way, actually did illuminate the characters.  Now I need to go back and watch the whole thing, in the expectation of a frustratingly good evening.  I don't want baroque feathers and posturing, and I cannot see why it is necessary to stage opera is such a bizarre fashion (note Cleopatra astride her rocket on the cover), but I have to admit that like Chereau's ""Ring"" this ""Julius Caesar""  scores highly on its own rather perverse terms.  I'm astonished - and utterly delighted with the singing and the acting.",1464998400,6,864,4.726666666666667
8751734,5,B01BW9NL2Q,"The musical qualities  on this recording are superb, as one would expect from this cast of performers.  The orchestral playing is just right for Handel, and everyone is in fine voice, with  Andreas  Scholl and Cecilia Bartolli  close to perfection in their  individual numbers and achieving beauty almost beyond belief when they sing together.  Their duet near the end of Act Three is glorious and would make a perfect  thing to play in order to introduce a friend to Handel's operas.  Special mention must also go to Anne Sophie Von Otter, Philippe Jaroussky, and ChristopheDumaux, any of whose arias could also make excellent demonstration pieces.  Unfortunately,  the sets and overall stage production are not on the same level as the vocal performances.  The action is set in the contemporary Middle East, and some of the images are too vulgar, too graphic or too ridiculous for my taste. In spite of these reservations, the singing is so beautiful that I award it five stars, and I will return to it frequently.  It is a worthy rival to my two favorite versions : the Glyndebourne production with Sarah Connolly and Danielle De Niese and the Danish production with Andreas Scholl and Inger Dam-Jennsen.  As to which of the three is the best, for me, the answer is likely to be the one I most recently watched.

One month later. Let me add to what I said above.  Now that I have viewed this performance several times,  I find I am so  put off by the staging that I cannot recommend it without serious reservations.  Good though the singing is, for me it does not overcome the vulgarity of the performance.",1463702400,10,1609,4.723021582733813
