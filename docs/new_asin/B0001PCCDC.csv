8015976,5,B0001PCCDC,I BOUGHT THIS BOOK BECAUSE I RECENTLY BOUGHT A OLD HOUSE WHERE SOMEONE HAD STOLEN ALL THE WIRE AND COPPER FROM UNDER IT. THIS DVD WAS GREAT TO HELP ME TO WIRE EVERYTHING BACK WHERE IT SHOULD .EVEN THOUGH THE HOUSE THEY ARE WORKING ON IN DVD WAS WIRED THROUGH THE FRAMING AS A NEW CONSTRUCTION TYPE SIMULATION AND MY HOUSE WAS WIRED UNDER A CRAWL SPACE I STILL GOT THE POINT THE DVD MADE. WISH THEY HAD SPENT A FEW MORE MINUTES ON THE BREAKER BOX BUT THEY DID SPENT ENOUGH TIME ON IT FOR YOU TO GET YOUR TASK ACCOMPLISHED. THE PLUMBING SECTION IS PRETTY GOOD ALSO. FORGET ABOUT THE DVD BEING OLD AND THIER HAIR STYLE AND CLOTHES . THIS DVD WILL HELP YOU IF YOU AREN'T ALL THAT COMFORTABLE WITH ELECTRICITY AND ALSO WILL HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE PLUMBING SYSTEM TOO ! ALL IN ALL I THINK THIS THIS DVD IS WORTH THE MONEY AND A MUST HAVE !,1322956800,4,837,4.109756097560975
8015977,1,B0001PCCDC,"This video was undoubtedly produced in the early 1970s.  Kind of embarrassing to show it to a high school class--drills with extension cords, bouffant hairdos, jumpsuits.  The kids thought it was some kind of joke.  Even if the material was accurate, the presentation failed.",1300665600,,275,5.204545454545454

8015979,4,B0001PCCDC,"I enjoyed the video and learned a good bit from it. I will probably buy another one or two from the series since the price is good. The information is probably still accurate today, but the big thing is just seeing people soldering or wiring something. These were clearly made in the '70s. First it had an older look to it, then the disco music kicked it. But I can say I enjoyed the DVD.",1169078400,9,388,4.1866666666666665
