4705355,5,B005HT404G,So I bought it even though I had viewed several of these - an excellent collection especially for those films I would be interested in viewing again after enough time has elapsed. Enjoyable.,1402272000,2,190,4.787878787878788
4705356,5,B005HT404G,"Liam Neeson is always amazing.  I particularly enjoyed Kinsey.  It was a very interesting, well acted film.  Well worth the price.",1402099200,2,130,5.095238095238095
4705357,5,B005HT404G,"Check Amazon for the list of the films you'll be buying. Here's a taste:
 THE BOUNTY (Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins), KINGDOM OF HEAVEN (Ridley Scott's finest, biggest movie), HIGH SPIRITS, (Peter O'Toole at this craziest, funniest)TAKEN (a true see & re-sew classic violence flick) , ROB ROY, NELL, KINSEY, A PRAYER FOR THE DYING, SHINING THROUGH. All memorable, all for collection bargain prices. That's many hours of great entertainment

What most folks haven't taken into account is that these are Big Pictures with great stars ( only noted two of many), including Neeson; Great directors. like Ridley Scott. And too, these monumental pictures like KOH have brilliant, comprehensive 'making
of' extras which almost equal the length of the features themselves in both length and quality. For film buffs, a real education. All NINE movies have particularly strong scripts and production values.

I am into movies of quality. KOH, HS, TAKEN and THE BOUNTY are in my top 100 favorites (my collection's in the thousands). Even NELL is extraordinary: Imagine Jodie Foster as a discovered 'wild child' in rugged wilderness. Astounding! Scary, too.",1390089600,12,1145,5.245901639344262
4705358,4,B005HT404G,This is a pretty good variety of Liam Neeson films I am happy with the purchase.  Does not have Michael Collins that would have been five stars but all the other films are good.,1364428800,9,177,4.205882352941177
4705359,4,B005HT404G,"This is an odd mix of Liam Neeson's films; of the nine MGM, UA, Samuel Goldwyn Company, Dino de Laurentiis, Tri-Star or 20th Century-Fox titles included in this two-volume foldout set packaged by 20th Century-Fox, four are lead roles, while the other five are supporting turns.  In fact, I chose this collection primarily to get a couple of the movies that Neeson is billed sixth or lower in the credits because I haven't seen them available separately.  The packaging is below average: the cardboard foldouts holding the discs are flimsy and do not carry nearly enough information to suit me.  Nowhere is there any indication of whether the films are widescreen or not (they all are), or list the correct sound characteristics, or the extras on each disc.  I will do some of that here.

THE BOUNTY  (1984)  is WS, and carries a preview.
A PRAYER FOR THE DYING  (1987) is WS or Standard (PS) and carries a selection of previews.
HIGH SPIRITS  (1988) is WS or Standard (PS) and carries a preview.
SHINING THROUGH  (1992) is WS with a featurette and several previews.
NELL  (1994) is WS with two commentaries (Michael Apted; Jodie Foster), a featurette and a preview.
ROB ROY  (1995) is WS with just a preview.
KINSEY  (2004) is WS with a featurette and various previews.
KINGDOM OF HEAVEN  (2005) is the WS theatrical version with a featurette and previews on one disc, and extras on a second disc.
These extras include an ""interactive production grid,"" ""History vs. Hollywood,"" an A&E ""Movie Real"" episode, internet featurettes and a preview.
TAKEN  (2008) is both the WS theatrical print and the WS unrated print, plus previews.

I couldn't tell what the sound characteristics were, but I sampled each disc and was impressed, especially with THE BOUNTY (Vangelis' excellent score is crystal clear) and KINGDOM OF HEAVEN.  The picture quality likewise seems very good.

With so much emphasis on Neeson's early work, this is an odd but intriguing cross-section of his career.  It's a little short on comedy (only HIGH SPIRITS qualifies as a comedy, and that just barely), and it stresses his skills with swords and daggers in at least three action-oriented roles.  Neeson is most interesting, I think, in the dramas NELL and KINSEY, which are happy additions to any anthology of his career.  Perhaps other titles could have been switched for KINGDOM OF HEAVEN or TAKEN (which are already popular DVDs), such as SUSPECT, BEFORE AND AFTER, THE GOOD MOTHER or GUN SHY, but at least SATISFACTION was not one of them.  All in all this is a nice collection that will fill a few holes in DVD collections of serious film fans (and overlap already bought titles in more than a few cases).",1321228800,38,2678,4.814004376367615
4705360,1,B005HT404G,"This is the worst collection if you want Liam's best films. The only films of note are a Mickey Rourke film, a Peter O'Toole film and the super Neeson film Taken. The rest is the stuff they cannot sell individually! It might be worth $3.95. Save your money. If you are a Liam Neeson fan, you already have his good films. I would only recommend buying High Spirits (starring the Great Peter O'Toole) as a fun film for your entire family to enjoy.",1320364800,10,445,4.373493975903615

8473617,5,B005HT404G,"I bought this collection for High Spirits, which is expensive and rare. Neeson's early stuff is the best to me, and those films are significantly more original than the action movies of the last decade he's done. This is a great collection at a fantastic price. My only disappointment was the flimsy case.",1467331200,,305,4.773584905660377

8473620,1,B005HT404G,"Purchased this on 7/15/15. Received defective disc and I am pissed. It was in original packaging until a few days ago when I decided to watch it. First film "" Shining Through"" was OK but ""Nell"" and ""The Bounty"" stopped in the middle of the movie and would not continue. It is past the due date for and exchange so I am out of luck. Been buying DVD sets on Amazon to watch later when I have time but right now I am hesitant to do so because of the return policy even if it is defective. Won't waste my time watching  the rest of this collection.",1446681600,4,544,4.08411214953271

8473622,1,B005HT404G,"I have the same problem as with TAKEN 2. We have watched a couple of the movies and liked them. The quality of the DVD itself sucks. We were very interested in the movie ""NELL"". At least four times the audio was broken for several minutes each time. I do not know what we are going to see or not be able to HEAR in the remaining movies. The movies are very good BUT the audio is not. Another problem with the ""COLLECTION"" is that Liam NEESON is not the star in some of the movies. My wife and I had recently viewed some of his movies and wanted more of the actors good movies, which this collection does not have. I must say that I did not do my homework on this purchase. I did not look up each movie but relied on ""THE COLLECTION"" to provide all of the ""STARRING LIAM NEESON"" quality with out my actually digging into each movie. The actual movies that star Mr. Neeson are very good and have excellent plot and production. Some that we have seen only have him with very minimum parts.",1425513600,8,986,4.167539267015707
