3441715,5,B0019N6SOO,I'm a Will Smith fan so ID4 is great and I look to be a classic someday. The other two were good too and blu-ray quality is great.,1236384000,,130,3.6785714285714284
3441716,5,B0019N6SOO,"Great bundle for putting your theater room to the test.  They look awesome, and the sound is enveloping.",1229212800,,104,4.777777777777778
3441717,2,B0019N6SOO,"All these movies are great and are perfect for a package deal. I would rate each of the movies with 4 (I robot and Day after tomorrow) and 5 (Independance Day) stars. The pricing deserves a lot less as at this time you can order I Robot on bluray here at Amazon for $17,49, Independance day for $16,99 and The day After Tomorrow for $ 24,49. This sums up to $58,97. When you look at the individual pages for each movie, Amazon even suggest to combine with the other 2 from the package for the given $58,97 price...See&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Robot-Blu-ray/dp/B0012GVKVY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I, Robot [Blu-ray</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Independence-Day-Blu-ray/dp/B000WQWPKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Independence Day [Blu-ray</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Day-After-Tomorrow-Blu-ray/dp/B000VDDWE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Day After Tomorrow [Blu-ray</a>]

If you think a case for packing the 3 bluray cases in a box is worth more than $7,- please order this package, otherwise I suggest to order each movie separate until Amazon corrects the price to a real package deal... It seems a small mistake has been made by Amazon as their own website shows how to get the Real Deal...

Either way you order them, there great movies. For me the favorite is Independance Day which gave me a American Classic feeling in a great action film. Eventhough a native German directed this! Maybe I am a little biased towards a higher rating as I attended the public premier days before the 4th of July in 1996 in Manns Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. That was an event I will remember for the rest of my life.",1227830400,,1772,5.9450980392156865
3441718,5,B0019N6SOO,"Sony dropped the ball on this one.  Poor picture and a sound track that is lame.  Until they redo the video in high definition and keep the original sound track, forget it!",1227571200,,172,4.34375
3441719,4,B0019N6SOO,"All these movies is a total pleasure to watch on Blu-Ray DVD. With this price, it's a must-have bundle. I highly recommend.",1224892800,,123,4.636363636363637
3441720,5,B0019N6SOO,Well in regards to the other review 25 X 3 = 75...... so it is cheaper.  How ever if you already own one like me :( it is cheaper to wait for them to go on sale :),1221091200,,163,3.289473684210526
3441721,1,B0019N6SOO,"Hey, Amazon, what's wrong here? Each of the discs can be ordered for 24,95. Shouldn't the bundle-price be cheaper than this ...???",1215475200,3,130,4.954545454545454
8274778,1,B0019N6SOO,This is a ridiculous price for these three DVDs as good as they are ! !,1465084800,,71,3.5

8274780,1,B0019N6SOO,"So the best I can tell, this review comes almost a year after most reviews on here and the pricing is still ridiculous. Current price for these movies purchased individually....$34.00, current price for this 3 pack....$70?????? Not sure what Amazon is thinking but this further proves that consumers need to read, read, read!!! No extras compared to individual discs equals no reason to purchase this set.",1266796800,,405,5.151515151515151
8274781,1,B0019N6SOO,"Right now (6/30/09), there are a bunch of ""bundles"" available that include 3 blu-ray movies. One of those bundles includes (I Robot, Day After Tomorrow, and Terminator) for $39.49. Divided into 3, that equals about $13 per movie. THIS bundle includes (I Robot, Day After Tomorrow, and Independence Day) costs $107.99. We already know that I Robot and Day After Tomorrow cost about $13, right?  Well, that means that Independence Day costs about $80 in this bundle. Thanks for the great price!!! I think I'll buy them seperately and save myself a ton of money...",1246320000,,561,4.905263157894737
8274782,1,B0019N6SOO,"At the current moment, you can buy these movies separately for $55.97, so why this bundle is so expensive is beyond me. Great pack, but not worth getting when you can save money the other way. I'd have given this 0 stars if that were possible!",1244419200,2,243,4.304347826086956
8274783,1,B0019N6SOO,As you can buy all three movies individually for far cheaper than the Bundle price I can't see why anyone would throw away $30.00 for this.,1244160000,2,139,4.384615384615385
8274784,5,B0019N6SOO,"I was online looking to buy The Day After Tomorrow and Indepedence Day on Blu-ray. I saw the sci-fi bundle with I Robot, another good movie, with a great savings over the regular prices. I was able to get what I wanted and saved money. Good job on a great bundle!",1243468800,,263,4.176470588235294
8274785,5,B0019N6SOO,"Come on now,107.99 for three Blu Ray movies,I don't think so,that's rediculous!!! I'v seen these on sale for 19.99,even that's expensive in my book! The 5 star rating is for the Blu Ray movies themselves,NOT the price of ths bundle! I buy bundles to save money,not to spend more $!!!!",1240099200,5,284,4.7
8274786,1,B0019N6SOO,"As of this day, April 16, 2009, the price for the trio is $ 107.99.  If one purchases the three titles individually NEW, the cost would be $ 24.99 for ID4 and Day After Tomorrow and $ 20.99 for I'Robot.  This totals $ 70.97.  If you purchase in this special package which includes ZERO extras, you get the extra benefit of handing over an additional $ 30.02. WOW! what a bargain.  I guess I should order these titles in combination with last year's Panasonic Blu-Ray player which is priced at $ 200 over it's MSRP.  It seems to me that Amazon would very much be at home in the new Obama administration, maybe as FAIR PRICING RETAIL CZAR.",1239840000,14,637,4.364406779661017
8274787,5,B0019N6SOO,"This is a must have starter bundle.  Science fiction and action movies are the best to own on blu-ray.  I highly recommend Independence day, The Day After Tommorrow and I Robot on Blu-ray.  It is also an attractive price.",1239494400,,221,4.615384615384615
