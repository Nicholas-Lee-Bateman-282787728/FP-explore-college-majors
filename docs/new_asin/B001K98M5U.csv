3663904,5,B001K98M5U,"One Piece is the #1 manga in Japan for a reason: it is simply phenomenol. Funimation continues to do the excellent story justice with superb voice acting and leaving everythng uncut. This DVD provides the Arlong Arc of the series, and this is where the series truly becomes excellent. Emotion, action, and superb storytelling fill this series of episodes. If you have had any doubts about One Piece, this DVD set will change your mind.",1241308800,,435,4.8133333333333335
3663905,4,B001K98M5U,One Piece is a great anime but this boxset only contains 13 episodes and all it has is the build up to the arlong fight at least finish the arc. i wish funimation would do the same as what there doing with dbz boxsets and give us at least 30 episodes instead of just 13,1236988800,,269,3.909090909090909
3663906,5,B001K98M5U,Awesome! Would recommend to any one piece fan. If you've never seen one piece before go watch it. Trust me you won't regret it! This dvd is the best of the 3 released so far! 5/5,1236470400,,178,3.9722222222222223
3663907,5,B001K98M5U,"I had bought this after already feverishly getting 1 and 2. It is amazing! I love One Piece, and was very disgusted with what 4Kids did to it.

Funimation does a simply FANTASTIC job with their Uncut One Piece. Nami's voice actor has some extremely intense scenes in this set, and executes them all perfectly.

Even if you watch the Japanese Version of One Piece (Which I still do, as well as read the manga), you will love these box sets! And I can't wait for the next one to come out!

Funimaiton, excellent job!",1234569600,3,514,4.389473684210526
3663908,5,B001K98M5U,"Kudos to Funimation for releasing the uncut series of One Piece DVDs!  Gone are the crappy voices and lollipops from the US TV release.  If you want to go authentic, by all means the Japanese audio track is great.  But the English dub is done really well, too.  This is just anime done right.

I've already read the manga series in Shonen Jump, so I knew what to expect, but the performances in this Third Voyage DVD set are just amazing.  Sanji is way cooler than I had given him credit for.  And during some of the Nami backstory sequences I even cried a bit. ^_^

There are some very emotionally powerful moments in this series, and the animation, story, and voice acting dos a fantastic job drawing it out.  I'm so glad that this has been right for the English speaking anime viewing audience, and eagerly look forward to the next volume.

BTW, in terms of extra features, Funimation includes the marathon mode that I believe they started with Dragonball Z.  Basically, if you pick this mode it skips playing the intro, ending, previews, and last episode recaps, essentially streaming all the episodes together into one big show.  It's a cool feature, but I really enjoy the intro and ending songs, so I generally watch the normal mode.  Also included are textless intros and endings (so you can fully view the animation without text blocking the view).",1232755200,9,1357,4.651260504201681
8314443,5,B001K98M5U,My sons loved these videos.  They came just like described.  Thanks.,1457827200,,68,5.090909090909091
8314444,5,B001K98M5U,Awesome series as usual.  One piece one piece,1418860800,,45,4.625
8314445,5,B001K98M5U,"Again, this is a series that is very unique. It has comedy, drama, action, adventure, etc. It's an endearing and quite popular anime title but that's because there's something in it that everyone can enjoy. Only complaint? It's a really long series so don't try to view it all in one sitting. Take it slow and enjoy it!",1388534400,,319,4.517241379310345
8314446,5,B001K98M5U,"the anime one piece is one of the best around, in this volume another aspect comes into play ""Betrayal"" as the strawhat crew continues to grow it is unwillingly betrayed by one of its own as Nami continues her venture to collect enough money to buy back her village from the nefarious fishman pirate Arlong",1388275200,,306,4.581818181818182
8314447,5,B001K98M5U,"I've always considered, 13 episodes sets super expensive when you know that collected editions are on the way. They are obviously meant for those with very little impulse control or those with money to throw around. However, personally knowing the greatness this show exudes, it's hard to assign blame. Luckily prices are going down,(under $10) so get them while you can... otherwise I will!",1372982400,,391,5.125

8314450,5,B001K98M5U,the story to this show just keeps getting better and better. A must have for any anime fans.,1286150400,,92,4.166666666666667
8314451,5,B001K98M5U,"Part three of Funimation's much beloved redub of One Piece. It's not that crappy Saturday morning version, I assure you. Uncut and unedited the way it's supposed to be.

For this stretch of episodes, it's nonstop action. We get the conclusion of the Baratie Arc and jump straight into the Arlong Arc. The two main villains appearing in these episodes are Don Krieg and Arlong. Sanji officially join the crew, and we get to look at Nami's backstory. One Piece really hits it's stride with these episodes, and there's nary a fluff episode in sight.

Special mention should go for episodes 35 and 36, Nami's backstory. I was concerned that the dub would lose the emotional weight of the story, but I was pleasantly surprised when the english VA for Nami managed to bring the right emotional sting to the role.

And don't foget to watch the commentary, you're paying for it, after all.",1262563200,3,881,4.707792207792208
8314452,5,B001K98M5U,"The fight with Don Krieg comes to an exciting close and Luffy is off to find Nami, with Sanji now it tow. He winds up at Arlong Park where the notorious pirate-fishman has begun his conquest of East Blue. Nami's past is revealed and there are some pretty intense scenes full of strong emotion. This marks the beginning of the best battle sequence so far in the series and the importance of nakama. This part also ends with something of a cliffhanger, so it is also recommended to get the Fourth Voyage as well.",1257897600,,510,4.4361702127659575
