7560940,5,B01926ZLX8,"Very interesting history on tractors and equipment during World War II years.  I thought it included facts that one does not usually see when viewing a chronicle of that time period.  For instance; if you didn't live through that time you wouldn't have known that the government shut down production or reduced output so that farmers and growers had to do with what they could get or accept whatever tractor that was available at dealerships.  All in all, a real good account and documentary!",1468540800,2,492,4.833333333333333

8743541,4,B01926ZLX8,"Though not a very long video (43 minutes), there's a lot of information presented to the viewer regarding the importance of American agriculture and agricultural machinery makers.

The DVD shows the revolutionary new agricultural products brought to market during the war to increase food production, save man-hours or use les materials such as the Ford ""N"" series with the Ferguson hydraulic-operated 3-point hitch system and the Massey-Harris combines.

What is often forgotten is that the United States produced so much of the allies foodstuffs during WWII. By the end of the war, virtually every mouthful of food the Soviet soldier ate came from the US or Britain - mostly the US. The American farmer was one of the unsung victors of WWII.

The video also relates the war production that agricultural-machinery makers undertook instead of tractors. The DVD highlights John Deere and Allis Chalmers and JI Case (which made a number of construction vehicles that could be air-landed to build airfields), but oddly enough does not mention the work done by International Harvester which, among other things, built 7500 half-tracked armored personnel carriers.

The DVD gives credit to farmers who went to war or fought to keep the world from starving as well as the women who were pressed into male roles in the factory and the farm. I would have liked to have seen more of the models that were allowed to be built during WWII, but a good video for the tractor enthusiast none-the-less. Four stars.",1492300800,,1498,5.028225806451613
