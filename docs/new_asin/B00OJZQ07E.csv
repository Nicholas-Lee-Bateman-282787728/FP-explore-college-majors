8698477,5,B00OJZQ07E,"This was a gift from my friend in Taiwan and although narrated in Mandarin,  English sub-titles may be selected.  I watched it first without the subtitles and it is visually stunning and beautiful with a lovely orchestral sound track but the the importance of this documentary to all viewers is the message (clearly conveyed through the the subtitles) about how the natural beauty and natural resources of Taiwan are slowly but surely being destroyed by thoughtless development.  As a Californian I quickly saw that what is happening in Taiwan is also happening in my state and in my country and all over the world.  This is a powerful argument for changing our ways before it is too late and I wish this could be seen by all peoples and legislators everywhere.  Watch it to enjoy the scenic beauty of Taiwan's mountains, coastline, lakes, rivers, rice paddies and many small farms and villages--and to learn about the critical need to preserve our planet Earth before it is too late.",1420416000,5,984,4.833333333333333
