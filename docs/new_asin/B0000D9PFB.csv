8000209,5,B0000D9PFB,I remember watching the final approach part as far back as I remember and love it. Watching it again brought back memories from when I was young with my dad. But the videos are great has some great footage and stories of WWII and Desert Storm. Highly recommended.,1436659200,,263,4.5
8000210,2,B0000D9PFB,"I have the VHS tapes from years ago when this series was first released. This was good as far as this disk. BUT there were MANY other episodes, and ALL of them needs to be put on disc and sold. Many were BETTER episodes.",1200268800,,220,4.0227272727272725
8000211,3,B0000D9PFB,"You can't fairly judge this DVD by the standards of modern movies, since  it is constructed almost entirely of film from a variety of historical  sources of varying quality.  It is most like an average sort of documentary  that you might see on cable TV, of interest to those who have an  appreciation for military aviation.
What is most appealing is that in the  second part of the disc, Canopies Up!, the narration is provided by  aviators themselves, as they describe their world in their own words.  One  down side is the overlap between the two portions of the disc, where one  harrowing incident involving an American pilot during the Gulf War is  covered in detail in both sections.  Once would have been sufficient.",968371200,8,723,4.741935483870968
