8374347,1,B002MZZTPM,"I couldn't tell you if this is Franco's weakest ""erotic"" horror film, but it's one of the weakest of the dozen or more I've seen.

Pretty-much all corners are cut here. Franco creates little in the way of atmosphere or any standout horror set-pieces. There's a lot of frumpy sex and nudity to pad out the pretty thin notion of Dracula's daughter inheriting the familial curse after her dying mother prompts her to visit the family tomb, and claim her destiny. If that sounds interesting, it's not, Franco just invests too little of himself to pull off the scenes that might have made this a horror film. Even poor Howard Vernon as the count, is given nothing to do but look stupid in his poorly made coffin that he actually never gets out of (!?)

The sex scenes are what I've come to expect from Franco, short on eroticism and long on pans and zooms that ultimately linger on muff. Franco isn't interested in conveying what the actors are supposed to be experiencing, he more-or-less just shows us what gets him off about being there filming them. It's pure voyeurism and little else.

Oddly enough what really sinks this one is the music score. Instead of a jazzy or psychedelic creation from the likes of Bruno Nicolai, you get a fairly pedestrian offering from Daniel White that fails to work in tandem with Franco's technique. It really illustrates how make-or-break a good, appropriate score is to a Franco film.",1485561600,2,1418,4.686746987951807
8374348,2,B002MZZTPM,A beautiful transfer of a lesser Jess Franco film.  1 star for how nicely it was shot. 1 star for the ladies.,1481155200,2,109,3.9545454545454546
8374349,3,B002MZZTPM,"Daughter of Dracula,"" directed by Jess Franco in 1972, was inspired by the enormously popular Hammer horror films made in England. Franco looked back to the iconic monsters of the 1930s, placed them in labyrinthine castles and crypts of the Spanish countryside, and spiced up the thrills with nudity and eroticism  uncommon in American films of the period. The film is loosely based on Sheridan LeFanus Carmilla.

A series of brutal killings are plaguing a remote European village. The locals insist they are the work of vampires, but a police inspector (Alberto Dalbes) and a reporter (Fernando Bilbao) dismiss this claim as superstition. The murders coincide with the arrival of beautiful Luisa Karlstein (Britt Nichols), summoned by her dying mother, who tells Luisa she is the direct descendent of a man who harbored a terrible secret.

The movie is a combination of the lesbian vampire theme; the Italian giallo genre, usually with mystery elements and often with slasher, supernatural horror, or crime fiction elements; and sexploitation. There aren't any really scary horror moments. Count Dracula himself (Howard Vernon) is a character but remains in his coffin throughout. As a vampire films go, this is pretty tame stuff, the pace is far too slow to create much suspense, and the acting is merely fair.

Bonus features on the unrated widescreen Blu-ray release include new audio commentary by film historian Tim Lucas, alternate safe footage (less sexually explicit), and original theatrical trailer. The film is in French, with optional English subtitles.",1475712000,10,1566,5.27710843373494
8374350,5,B002MZZTPM,"This is the American release of Dracula Daughter. Much better transfer, and I recommend it instead if the European issue. A good take on the old Carmilla legend, with plenty of sexy scenes throughout the Vampire sequences",1455062400,8,221,5.0
8374351,2,B002MZZTPM,"Avant-garde or schlock? Sadly, I must vote for the latter. This movie is not satisfying as either a horror or erotica. If you want to watch a great film about Dracula's female offspring, you will be much better served viewing the Universal classic DRACULA'S DAUGHTER (1936).",1449792000,17,274,4.978260869565218
