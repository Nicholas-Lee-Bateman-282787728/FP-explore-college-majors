It offers a clear expose' on on how we need to be called to take action to protect GOD's greatest creatures, the DOG",1363219200,5,246,4.25531914893617
5325432,5,B009GGWW1Y,"I have never had such a difficult time watching a film. There is a scene where shelter dogs, some of them mere pups, are ""put to sleep"" with gas. I will never forget their cries. I guarantee that after watching this film, you will not be able to ever buy a dog purely because they have the right pedigree or you like the breed. You will hustle to the nearest shelter and save a homeless dog from death. And you should. The best friends come from the shelter. Shelter pets will change your life for the better. They react to a home and some simple affection with so much appreciation. They give back to you a thousand times what you give them.",1361750400,6,642,4.270491803278689
5325433,5,B009GGWW1Y,"I knew going into this documentary that it was going to be a tough one to get through based on the content. I had no idea exactly how much it would make me sad and angry and guilty but then also passionate about this cause. You cannot watch this documentary and walk away afterwards as the same person you were before it. It is honest and brutal and something that everyone needs to see. Pets are forever and the disposable mentality that exists is sickening. I foster dogs so I see first-hand how many amazing and otherwise perfectly healthy animals are thrown away like trash.

In a perfect world, anyone surrendering an animal would have to watch this documentary first and see exactly what happens to their one-time beloved pet that was part of their family. Truth is, in most places, half of the HEALTHY cats and dogs do not make it out of the shelters alive. The ones that are dropped off with preventable and treatable conditions are pretty much given a death sentence on the spot. These poor animals did nothing to deserve their lives cut so short. And just as in the documentary, and any shelter worker will confirm this, but it is the same people over and over bringing in litters of puppies and kittens because they just refuse to have their animals spayed or neutered.

There are so many ways to combat this dirty secret that HBO has brought to light. People need to spay and neuter their animals. Also if you have the means to, please consider donating your time or money to your local shelter or rescue groups. Want to help even more? Foster or adopt a rescue pet. Short on time and money? Then just sign petitions and lobby for banning barbaric forms of euthanization like the gas chambers seen in the video and heart sticks (Be warned before you go off to Google that) and share, share, share any available animals on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. We can absolutely turn this situation around, but not overnight and not without people seeing the truth of what goes on behind closed doors every day.

Thank you to HBO for creating this eye opening film.",1352419200,17,2069,4.571428571428571
5325434,4,B009GGWW1Y,"Although a certain portion of One Nation Under Dog is quite harrowing to watch, it is overall an excellent documentary which effectively explores both humanity's insensitivity and cruelty to dogs as well as our (sometimes saintly) compassion for their plight as souls who are often wholly dependent upon people for their wellbeing and survival. The film focuses on the broad variety of human attachment to dogs but, disturbingly, also on what might readily be described as ""criminal"" indifference to their needs and fate. For me, the most interesting aspect of One Nation Under Dog was its look at rescue workers who quite literally save the lives of unwanted animals by taking them out of shelters sometimes with only days left before they are to be euthanized. The three sections of this documentary explore owners of dogs which frighten and injure people, the intense grief owners may feel when they lose a beloved pet, and the service industry devoted to dealing with the MILLIONS of dogs that are discarded and/or mistreated each and every year. Beautifully photographed and cogently written, One Nation Under Dog is an important contribution to the growing body of work which delineates the problematic of human-animal relations and I recommend it enthusiastically to anyone with an interest in this topic.",1350259200,10,1312,5.164319248826291

8541246,5,B009GGWW1Y,"Great film,absolutely gut wrenching. I cried from start to finish when part 2 came on and as soon as I saw the metal gas chamber I fast forwarded through that part because I couldn't stomach seeing it. How people can do such things to animals is beyond me. I have one purebred dog and had every Intention of shelling out the dough to buy a second eventually, until I saw this.so many sweet babies out there needing homes and when I do decide to get that second dog I know where I now will get it.",1502755200,,496,4.177083333333333

I didn't have any issue with the DVD-R, item was packaged like new.",1380931200,,160,4.925925925925926
8541253,5,B009GGWW1Y,"If you love dogs, it's impossible not to be affected by this excellent documentary.  There's one scene in the middle that's especially difficult to watch.  It was trimmed by about two minutes when it was shown on HBO.  There are some very touching scenes along with some very sad ones.  You might want to keep a box of tissue handy when you watch it.  It's well worth your 70 minutes!",1368748800,,384,4.428571428571429
