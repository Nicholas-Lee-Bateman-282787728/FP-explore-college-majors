8169306,5,B000MHVBZE,"""On Board the Morgan"" explains whaling, a major industry in the 19th century, in a way that upper elementary students can understand easily.  David Littlefield, the on-screen narrator is interesting and engaging.  His discussion is illustrated by a modern-day tour of the Charles Morgan whaling ship at Mystic Seaport and features video made in the early 20th century of whaling aboard a wooden whaler.  Some of these early video clips are from ""Down to the Sea in Ships"" (1922), and others are from footage identified in the credits of the documentary. On Board the Morgan is not a political statement, but merely records a way of life from early American history. This documentary quotes passages from the novel ""Moby Dick"" to give the spirit of the whaling voyage.",1376006400,,767,4.9765625
