2881365,5,B000S6KTXE,I've been watching this great show for free in the US at Hulutv.com. If you have the dvd's I suggest buying online(you can't get them in the US stores) a multi region dvd player. Worth it if there are other great Canadian shows. The first season was really good but the second season is terrific!,1221609600,,296,4.4
2881366,5,B000S6KTXE,"I just discovered this show on Hulu, only they don't have all the episodes.  I've sat at my computer half the day watching it!  I really, really HOPE they come out with DVD sets that we can play here in the States.  Just wanted to add my vote to the list.",1221350400,,255,3.9607843137254903
2881367,5,B000S6KTXE,"Being a scientist in a molecular medicine lab myself, I enjoy the great realism of the show - as well as the sophisticated storytelling. I have so far only watched the first season, and I am getting the second one on DVD from Amazon.de. Weirdly enough, you can get the DVD in England and Germany but neither in Canada nor the United States, and my colleagues here in the US have not even heard of this TV Series at all!
Anyhow, as I said, you can get the DVD from Amazon in Germany, where it costs 44 Euros incl. shipping and taxes, or about $65 at the current exchange rate. This may seem steep, on the other hand, you get 4 DVDs. Since they are region code 2, you need a DVD player that you can unlock, so it will be able to play DVDs from regions other than 1 (in the US), e.g. a Philips DVP642, which can be unlocked by typing in the right code on the remote (the actual code can be found on the internet).
With this series, it's well worth the effort!",1219622400,8,956,4.117647058823529
2881368,4,B000S6KTXE,"I really like this show! It's like Numb3rs, but with viruses instead of math, and without the field detective work. I've been watching season one on Hulu, but I'm worried that I won't be able to see subsequent seasons. I hope they put the rest of the seasons on Hulu or release DVDs.",1219017600,,283,4.3584905660377355
2881369,5,B000S6KTXE,"Fantastic show-- smart plots, great characters - it's like CSI meets 24 meets House meets the Center for Disease Control (although I'd argue that Regenesis is far better than the first two in that list)

2881370,5,B000S6KTXE,"This is really frustrating. It's in boxed sets in PAL television format in the UK, but I haven't seen evidence that it's been released in North America.

Given that it originates in Canada, all I can figure is that they don't want to erode syndication revenue by releasing it on this side of the pond. Then again, I've only heard of Six Million Dollar Man DVDs in the UK as well.

Oh, the vagaries of content licensing.",1207353600,7,419,4.428571428571429

2881373,5,B000S6KTXE,"I love this series. My only wish is that they had bothered to release in blueray instead of just DVD. DVD was old even when the show started to air.

I really wish this had run primetime in the US. I only found it because I was a nocturnal student.

I really wish more TV shows tried a fiction science (fictional stories about real science) bend instead of the traditional science fiction which is getting very stale.",1413417600,,417,4.402597402597403

2881375,4,B000S6KTXE,"I pick up shows that I have never seen while they were on TV. Here is a show that has a police procedule, sci-fi, drama mix. The shows star Outerbridge is a fairly well known actor. He carries this show as the lead and the writing does the rest. Good show with good back up cast make for a satisfying evenings entertainment.
The show was on for 4 seasons but so far only this season is released, Too bad would love to see all of it.",1403136000,,432,4.034883720930233
2881376,5,B000S6KTXE,"This is an excellent series. Adventurous and gritty, well acted and a plotline that leaves you asking for more. I have to say that I am greatly disappointed that it seems only season 1 is available (US) and seasons 2-4 just won't ever be put on DVD's.",1399593600,,251,4.361702127659575
2881377,4,B000S6KTXE,"Hi,

Look, I liked the series. I liked the fact that they tried - not completely successfully in my view - to make the science only just beyond what is currently achievable. And I really liked that among the extras they included a snippet of educational material about genetic engineering etc. But it fell down for me in a couple of places.

The first was the lab itself. I've worked in microbiology research labs. I've never seen a lab so dark. It was clearly done for ambiance etc, but in reality labs just aren't like that. They're light airy places because lets face it, as someone handling any sort of culture or chemical you want to be able to see what you're doing. Second where was the biological containment? They're dealing with among other things the Spanish flu, that's not stuff you leave simply lying around on a work bench.

Never mind. That's probably just a pet peeve of mine. What let the series down as a drama for me was the lead actor. I found him so over the top - moody, arrogant, insensitive and basically insufferable that I didn't believe him. I certainly didn't believe him as a father. I get that they wanted him to fill the eccentric obsessed scientist role, but quite frankly I don't know any scientists like that. And to be honest someone who was that way wouldn't be hired and he would absolutely never be put in charge of other people.

However the stories were good, the rest of the cast were good, and a few did outstanding acting in some of the minor roles.

Cheers, Greg.",1385424000,,1508,4.489051094890511
2881378,5,B000S6KTXE,"I saw several comments on imdb from people who work in this field that the science is scarily spot on - the DVD transfer could be better, in fact quite a lot better but the show more than makes up for it. There are four seasons and the last season is weird. And preachy. Not to say they are wrong about the political and social status of our world, but who likes preachy?",1372982400,,371,4.095890410958904
2881379,5,B000S6KTXE,Good plot lines and I think plausible science.  Waiting for the second and third season on DVD for US and Canada.  I have only seen these in the other video formats.  I have been able to watch the season 2 and 3 on Hulu plus.  4th season is still missing in action.  I found the series to be interesting in it's use of current science taken toward it's probable end.  Lead character is very human and very flawed which adds a flare to the drama.  Why can't we get more of this type of high quality programming?,1355011200,,510,4.195876288659794
2881380,5,B000S6KTXE,"Great show just wish more of it was on DVD/BD in the USA. The scientists remind me of my friends and proffessors, very flawed and human.",1347235200,,136,4.269230769230769
2881381,5,B000S6KTXE,It's a shame that it never made it's way to the states. Great show. Science and the characters are both realistic and believable.,1341705600,,129,4.6521739130434785
2881382,5,B000S6KTXE,"Amazon does a great job giving a series description.

Peter Outerbridge carries the series as David Sandstrom, a womanizing, arrogant, egotistical and sometimes savant in the same vane as ""House"".  Great supporting cast, including Ellen Page as David's Daughter who clearly illustrates her acting chops in a glimpse of what is to come.

This show is relevant, topical and compelling at the same time and would likely have died a slow painful death if it premiered in the USA.  Kudos to The Movie Network in Canada allowing this series to have a 4-seasons run.  Unfortunately, only seasons 1-2 are readily available.

Season 1-2 are great, season 3 is very good and season 4 stalls a bit, though is still good.
Highly recommended as a program that is different from most anything else available.",1336521600,,794,4.932330827067669
2881383,4,B000S6KTXE,Good acting and a storyline that continued throughout the first season made this a gripping series. Plus a glimpse of Ellen Page before she made it big in Hollywood.,1329436800,3,165,4.724137931034483
2881384,3,B000S6KTXE,"This guy they have playing the lead is just a complete failure in my book. They portray him right off the bat as some sort of ladies man, but seriously, take a look at him. There is no way that would be likely in real life. The guy would just barely come in as ""average"" in looks. Certainly no higher. Another thing I hated was him constantly rubbing and scratching and cracking his neck. By the second time he did this I could tell it was intentional and from thereafter looked fake and became annoying as heck.
 Lastly, if you're not one of those people out there that likes watching the History channel, where you get to learn about mysterious things, such as the human body, then you most likely won't like this series. This show is alot like House, so if you liked that series then you're going to like this one, most likely.",1323820800,,830,4.354838709677419

I would buy all the seasons in a heartbeat if they were available for US customers on Amazon.  I was really happy the last season didn't end with a cliffhanger....but wrapped up the series.

It's so great, that I found it by accident on network TV syndication at 3am (chronic insomnia) and I actually set my alarm clock now so I can get up to watch it and then STILL go to church at 8:30am!  (No...I do not have TiVo or ""other"" recording mechanism)  Compelling drama, intelligent humor, great character development, interesting camera angles or tricks to show you that two story lines occur at the same time, nice use of fantasy (you're almost disappointed to find out David didn't actually punch out the pompous bureaucrat...he only imagined what it would be like with us along for the ride, but then back to ""reality"").

I like Ellen Page as an actress, but her ""teenager with an attitude"" portrayal of Lilith is like fingernails on a blackboard. The insolence and eye-rolling and sighing -- gah! The main character, her father, is a selfish jerk. None of the other characters are likeable either. The one woman I sort of liked, Hera (Kira?) is played by a woman so physically unattractive that even SHE is painful to watch. I forced myself to watch the first 3 episodes and then had to stop.

8204387,4,B000S6KTXE,"What a find for an extraordinary low price. ReGenesis is a Canadian science mystery series that ran for four seasons. The series follows a team of scientific investigators who work for NorBAC (North American Biotechnology Advisory Commission) who invesitgate mysteries that are of biological origins such as bioweapons, genetics, and diseases. NorBAC is sort of a combination of the CDC and the fictional CSI series. The actors play their role as scientists very well, believably and realistically.
It is a shame that this series is it not more widely available. Why this very good series was never picked up by American television is a mystery. Season 1 is the only season available in the USA on DVD and is difficult to find.",1445990400,,727,4.967213114754099

8204389,3,B000S6KTXE,"ReGenesis: a 5-star series*
Video quality: 1 star (DVD), 3 stars (Blu-ray)

Season One was selling for an incredibly low $6 new on DVD, so I picked up a copy... and quickly discovered why it was only $6. The curse of the letterbox: if you don't mind watching a screen within a screen (this one is black bars at the top/bottom AND both sides, in a well intentioned attempt to retain the integrity of the aspect ratio and picture quality), then by all means, spend $6. I'm accustomed to left/right black bars on old TV shows (4:3) and likewise can also cope with the top/bottom bars of many widescreen films (like 2.35:1), but when confronted with 4 black bars you somehow feel betrayed (the first time I experienced this unfortunate scenario was with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Birds-of-Prey/dp/B000SMNL92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Birds of Prey</a>). To retain my sanity,  I abandoned the DVD set and subsequently purchased the German release of ReGenesis seasons 1 & 2 on Blu-ray (which is what you will receive if you order the Blu-ray) in hopes of seeing a reasonable presentation. While the picture quality doesn't live up to what we expect from Blu-ray (it's a bit snowy in the brighter scenes), it does discard the black bars (filling the entire screen), and is as good of a [presumably] remastered version as we will ever see.

* 5 stars >> if << you love science, less than that if you don't. ReGenesis is certainly full of fiction to keep it sensational for a broader audience (bioterrorism, human cloning, biological warfare, potential pandemics), but since the writers also assumed an audience can have an attention span longer than 10 seconds, there isn't an avoidance of portraying and talking about real science in ReGenesis. We can guess why less than three dozen reviews have been written for a season that was released on disc several years ago... intelligent scripts with college level discourse: we can't have that!!
That's not to say that there isn't soap opera drama. The Chief Scientist (David) sleeps with the new Lead Virologist (Jill) before she joins the research team. David's daughter, played by a very young looking [pre-Juno] Ellen Page, comes to stay with him for half the season. Page is by no means the only excellent actor in the season.

The music of ReGenesis is particularly engaging. Aside from HBO, the opening sequence is among the best produced for television; the music puts you in the mood fantastically, and I crank up the volume loud every time I watch the opening sequence.

Final thoughts: Although episodic, there is an overarching theme in the season. You would think the US Ebola scare of 2014 could draw people to watching ReGenesis, but apparently not, even when Ellen Page is added to the mix.",1440201600,,2795,5.028077753779698
8204390,4,B000S6KTXE,This show just got better and better each episode. While slow the first few episodes are needed to introduce characters and concepts. When I first watched the whole series I only came in at Season 1 Episode 9. I was sad to see the series finish prematurely - I could never have imagined how they came up with the final episodes. Brilliant stories. The Canadians are getting better and better at producing TV shows - especially their Sci-Fishows. Seasons 2-4 are 5 star +++++++.,1433289600,,477,4.690476190476191
