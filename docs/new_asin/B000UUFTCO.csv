You know there is alot to this little movie and That's shocking !
We have missionaries,zombies,drug smuggling and it all takes place in Panama via stock footage.
Okay,That husband and wife team whop brought you `FART The Movie',Has outdone themselves and its all on screen.
The characters although played by unknown actors are believable and the zombies are unique in portrayal.
85 % filmed in Florida again(ALL their films are),And clever use of stock footage of foreign countries adds thousands of dollars to THE LOOK of film.
There is action,chases,wild sets and even wilder performances with police men.",1273708800,,643,5.1923076923076925

1) ACTING: Not bad, not incredible, but not bad. A few of the actors, I don't know if their acting was bad, or if they were having trouble making the dialogue seem convincing.

2) PRODUCTION: Again, not bad, but I felt that there was almost TOO much stock footage in this film when the investigators were in Panema. Yes, I agree Panema is a pretty place with lots of nice scenery, but I don't really wanna see it in a zombie film. Minimal blood and gore. Editing was kinda rough, as in a few scenes, a character takes 12 minutes to get his 30 second point across. I know that this info was relevant to the movie, but it just seemed to take FOREVER to get to it. The soundtrack was okay.

3) ZOMBIES: These zombies were different. With minimal make-up, they looked like everyone else, but they may have had a bullet wound or a knife wound. And the majority of them wore brown monk robes. They were very subdued and pretty much were used as hired hands. I had an issue with them near the end of the movie as when they attacked someone, they started to behave as ""normal"" movie zombies, and tore a guy apart.

4) THE CAUSE: Voodoo / Black magic.

5) NUDITY: None.

I had high hopes when this one first started with the voodoo rituals and all, but the ""different"" zombies and the editing really made this one a tough movie to get through. Even during the action scenes, I found myself bored. While I did find the purpose of the zombies to be different, it was too little, too late to save this one for me. I don't think this movie was horrible, but the budgetary restrictions, and the editing really caused this movie to seem worse than it was. The storyline was a good idea, just badly executed.
