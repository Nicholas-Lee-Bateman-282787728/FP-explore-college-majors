8402451,5,B003QR2SQS,"Speaking in Code is a funny, warm, touching and artfully constructed documentary with a surprising intimate storyline.  This isn't your typical electronic music documentary at all, in fact, it feels like a real documentary.  I thought the personal storyline gave the film depth and heart.  It said something poignant about the power of obsession especially with music, and how this can affect lives.  I found many of the characters to be quite entertaining and there were moments when I even teared up.  I'd recommend this documentary to people regardless of their taste in music, but especially if they love music.",1440892800,,615,5.11
8402452,1,B003QR2SQS,"This was advertised as a documentary on electronic music, but was drawn out and poorly edited story about a couple's falling apart.  It's painful to watch, amateur, and has nothing to do with positivity in electronic music. Documentary fail.",1402358400,,241,5.17948717948718
8402453,1,B003QR2SQS,"As the director herself admits at one point, the film focuses above all else on her techno-geek husband. Not clear why. He's not particularly compelling or fun to watch. On two occasions we're treated to hear him speak at length about their credit card problems due to making the documentary. He seems to make admirable attempts to bring techno to their town of Cambridge, MA, but ask yourself how much you'll care before watching. It's a shame they went all the way to Berlin and Barcelona only to ask a few great artists inane questions. With barely any actual music footage, there's little redeeming value here.",1384819200,,614,4.80188679245283
