1410017,5,B00005A05W,"This is an excellant workout tape. Interested in the intensity of the aerobic portion, I hooked up my HRM and checked it out. I  got to 60% max heart rate and could sustain 70% max with no problem. Obviously if the 20 minute time period isn't enough, do it over, or hit pause between sections and do a few more reps.  In addition, use more weight.  For those that are initially intimidated by the speed of the aerobic section, play it in slow motion without weights until you get the gross movements down.  Then play it at speed without weights until you refine the movements with Jennifer's instructions while breathing properly.  Then add weights.  The Pilates section is a great workout.  The last portion is Yoga based and is both energizing and relaxing.  If you sincerely want to improve your posture and become stronger throughout while being coached by the focused, intelligent and quiet Jennifer Kries, purchase and use this tape.",993254400,17,939,4.788819875776397
1410018,4,B00005A05W,"I have taken a few Pilates mat classes, and found this DVD to be excellent for a beginner.  I like Jennifer Kries because she explains the moves really well - you don't have to keep looking up at the screen to see what she is doing because her descriptions are so clear.  Also, she is down to earth and no nonsense, and I just like her style.  One great feature of this DVD is the cardio section.  Many Pilates workouts don't include cardio work, and this one is nice 'cos it uses light weights and is low impact (but still manages to raise my heart rate).  I normally do The Firm workouts, and am used to more strenuous weight and cardio work, but this workout has made a difference in my abdominals and my flexibility.  I'm looking forward to trying Jennifer Kries' other Pilates workouts.",992476800,31,791,4.4206896551724135
1410019,5,B00005A05W,"This is a great workout and she goes nice and easy while giving you various options for the stage you are in. She doesn't talk down to you as you work out and the workout is a good one. In Core Condtioning when she says ""now you should be feeling this in you ads"" WOW you are and it's a good burn. Jennifer also gives you a back and forth workout ... meaning you don't do all abs then move to legs ect ect. Nope she does a little abs moves to legs back to abs then back. So just as 1 group is getting a beatin' and feeling tired it's getting a rest in the next mix. This DVD also has 3 workouts for 14.99 where as Denise's offers 2 workouts + 1 additional hip and thighs which is just a repeat of things from the workouts for 14.99.  Jennifer's is a better buy for your money and a better workout, too.
You won't be spending your money poorly if you get this DVD.",990921600,17,863,3.9314285714285715
1410029,4,B00005A05W,"I wanted to give this 5 stars, but I don't ever use the core part of the workout, so I didn't think that was fair. The Metabolic Booster workout is amazing though. It's a great mix of stretching, light weights, and balance/posture moves that moves fast enough to keep me interested. I've done this one 3 times this week, and people keep commenting on my posture! I highly recommend this one, and anything with Jennifer Kries.",1360713600,2,425,4.605263157894737
1410030,5,B00005A05W,"I still use my copy on VHS !  I find the Pilates and the Yoga sections work really well on their own. I've been practicing these modalities for over 20 years and they're still effective. My boyfriend even likes these sections because he says she's easy to follow. The second program is on the light side for a advanced workout, but great for a beginner.  Thank you Jennifer !!!",1336780800,,377,4.449275362318841
1410031,4,B00005A05W,"I have been exercising with this DVD for 2 years now and i love it.
The Yoga routine at the end is a real treat.",1304985600,,112,3.52
1410032,5,B00005A05W,"I really like this DVD! For reference, I've been using it for about three weeks and I consider myself an intermediate to advanced exerciser.  By the time I finish I've built up a sweat, I've stretched my whole body with challenging poses, and I've toned with weights---so the workout is comprehensive.  Kries' instruction encourages you to pay attention to your body's needs right in the moment so anything else on my mind has to wait till later! As a result, I feel more focused and mentally refreshed with this workout, almost like I've meditated.  My body awareness has also increased and my movement is more graceful and strong. When I stand up after the workout, my posture is perfect and I walk with a strong tush and relaxed back.

A word about the cardio segment---it's challenging as I tend to lose my balance during lunge sequences.  For now, I've modified the exercises a little bit and with awareness of my core I'm gradually getting better.  But it's really effective at making me sweat and toning my thighs.  As for the choreography itself, I didn't find the routine too hard to follow once I'd tried it once or twice (although the movements are challenging).",1265328000,,1173,4.748768472906404
1410033,5,B00005A05W,I love the workout 3!  It's only 20 mins stretching / yoga / deep breathing exercise & it really make me feel great!  Sleep better after this routine if I do it before bed time! Highly recommend to weaker & stressed out people.  It doesn't require lots of strength & skills and it's very relaxing.,1249084800,,297,4.363636363636363
1410034,2,B00005A05W,"I really didn't like this workout routine. The core workout hardly makes me break a sweat and I'm totally out of shape. The metabolic booster workout is way too complex and I feel like I miss half of the benefits from the workout because I'm too busy trying to do the moves right. Overall, this is my least favorite video from Jennifer Kries.",1242604800,3,342,4.444444444444445
1410035,5,B00005A05W,"Jennifer Kries is the absolute best Pilates instructor, to my opinion. For beginners or advanced she's always right on point with perfect illustration of the moves and calm precise directions.
I feel regenerated after doing her DVD Pilates Class.",1234224000,,246,5.333333333333333
1410036,4,B00005A05W,"I have enjoyed other workouts by Jennifer Kries for the past couple of years.  I absolutely love the core conditioning and AM/PM segments of this program.  She holds the stetches longer, gives better directions on posture and focuses more on breathing than in the other programs I have.  I already loved what I had and ordered this for variety, and I have been very happy with my purchase.
The matabolic booster was a nightmare for my friend and I when we tried it.  We sat sat and watched it then tried it ourselves.  Unless you are already coordinated and smooth, this segment is not helpful.  I can't walk and chew gum at the same time, so swinging weights and trying to combine 3 or 4 other movements at the same time only led to big bruises and frustration.  Forturnately, we tried this when the 2-year old was out of the house.
This program is totally worth the purchase price, but I am going to have to look elsewhere for a more aerobic workout.",1229990400,2,952,4.468208092485549
1410037,5,B00005A05W,"This is a very good exercise DVD. It has three sections. I do one section of it that's half an hour long every other day and I'm still working to getting it right. You need very light weights (3 lbs?) be barefoot and you will be on the floor for part of it so get your mat ready. It's graceful and not flashy but way more precise and difficult than it looks. You can't take your eyes off the screen and it takes a while to get the moves of the legs and arms together, so I've been focusing on the legs (I'm kind of a spaz with dance moves). She targets many body parts at a time and uses sweeping motions. I am dripping sweat by the end and feel sore in lots of places!",1191110400,9,669,3.926470588235294
1410038,5,B00005A05W,"Jennifer Kries is definitely the Pilates goddess of the workout world. Not only does she create challenging Pilates workouts, she gives perfect instruction and teaches you to respect your body in a new way. This is her New Method style workout. It is a combination of Pilates, Weight Training, Dance and Yoga.

Workout 1 - Core Conditioning - Classic Pilates routine and Yoga moves. You will recognize all the basic Pilates moves with the roll-ups and modified roll-ups. Jennifer gives a lot of advice on modifying, but I just have to say that I have my own secret ways for getting from the flat-on-back position to the bending over one's legs position. I'm not sure she would approve. While Jennifer shows each position, she gives even more ""breathing"" instructions. I love ""rolling like a ball"" and the challenge of making each exercise so precise.

Workout 2 - Metabolic Booster - Light weight training segment to increase cardiovascular strength. I love this almost ""dance-style"" workout. Jennifer is working out with four workout partners/instructors.

The music is motivational, the colors are inspirational and the setting is so classic. You flow through the stretches like a dancer and then learn to get fancy with the weights. You are moving fairly fast so it is advisable to really learn the moves before increasing your speed. I found that once I was distracted by anything, I had to refocus, rewind and begin again.

This is the most challenging weight workout I've ever done. Not only does this push you to the limit of your coordination, you are also moving in a very creative way. I love this section because it will be one I will be perfecting for months. Your arms will feel toned and the addition of the weights also helps you burn extra calories during the cardiovascular moments.

Workout 3 - AM/PM Rejuvenation - Yoga-based workout to release tension and promotes flexibility. You will recognize all the basic yoga moves and there are a few variations with an added dose of creative appeal.

Breath of Fire is an exercise I've recently seen in many yoga workouts. Jennifer almost seems to relax into this workout, although she is still just as precise. Her personality comes across especially well in the newer videos. She not only talks the viewer through the exercises, she is very comfortable with the entire process.

I like the way you can actually hear Jennifer breathing in various exercises, it reminds you to breathe! She teaches some breathing techniques I've been seeing in a number of yoga workouts. It only took me about three videos to get that breathing technique under control. Ironically, the secret is to let go of control.

This workout is the most challenging Jennifer Kries workout I've ever completed. If you do all three workouts one after the other, there is no need to do any cardiovascular work before starting this routine. Normally, I'd suggest walking for about 30-40 minutes, but with this workout, you don't need any additional exercise. You will strengthen and tone your entire body in 60 minutes. ""Perfect Mix"" has all the elements of a full-body workout and stretch.

I noticed immediate results in how toned my body felt and also in my posture. Jennifer has the perfect body and now we know why. It takes intense determination and when you do this workout over a short period of time, you will almost become addicted to the demanding aspects.

The workout you need to move into an entirely new realm of fitness. If you have working out for a few years and want to test your strength, ""Perfect Mix"" will invigorate and energize you. I highly recommend this workout.

1410058,5,B00005A05W,I love this DVD!  Jennifer Kries is so pleasant that it's like having a good friend over for tea.  I absolutely love the fluid movements of the warm up.  And the second section is a great way for me to do all the pilates I need without going overboard--the whole thing lasts about an hour and is really enjoyable.  I feel great after and it stays with me all day.,1165881600,,363,4.142857142857143
1410059,5,B00005A05W,"This is my favorite tape and I go back to it again and again.  The three separate workouts allow you to divvie them up to different days, if desired.  Each section is about twenty minutes: pilates mat workout that strengthens the core and targets the abs; an aerobic workout done with light weights for resistance and building muscle; and a relaxation stretch.  Jennifer Kries is a terrific instructor.  She explains while doing, so your not standing around killing time between exercises, and she talks just enough, not too much, and in a pleasant, non-condescending or patronizing way, and without ridiculous over-enthusiasm.  In other words: perfect.",1164672000,20,653,5.180952380952381
1410060,5,B00005A05W,"I have several pilates- and yoga-inspired workout dvd's, but I always end up going back to this one.  The 2 main reasons for this are: 1)Each workout, and the 3 together, have a great amount of variety and they don't get boring, and 2)Everything you need is on this one dvd.  The metabolic booster, my favorite segment, includes total-body strength, stretching, and cardio.  I am not much for dancing, but I learned this routine fairly painlessly and continue to enjoy it.  For me the routine quite effectively targets the buns without endless and boring squats and lunges, which I appreciate.  I usually follow the metabolic booster with the core conditioning segment, which targets more muscle groups than your average 20-minute pilates routine.  I like the final rejuvevation segment for days when I'm not feeling up to a full workout, or if I've gotten a little out of shape and I need to ease back into the other 2 workous.  I am thrilled with this dvd and I highly recommend it.",1110240000,3,984,4.752941176470588
1410061,5,B00005A05W,"This is my favorite workout CD.  I've have been doing pilates for quite some time but have been concerned that it doesn't really have that cardio effect.  This tape has it all.  The metabolic booster is a great compliment to the other two segments.  And, Jennifer moves right through without an endless description of how to do each movement.  I highly recommend this CD!",1105401600,2,371,4.734375
1410062,5,B00005A05W,"I am so glad I ordered this DVD! I think Jennifer Kries gives great instruction, and unlike some new pilates videos out there being marketed by any fitness guru, Jennifer Kries makes certain that you understand proper breathing and ""navel to spine"". She also gives little reminders about form, that I found helpful.
The core segment is classic pilates exercises with some yoga poses thrown in. Jennifer gives great instruction, and actually tells you when you *should* be feeling the work in the abdominals (and she was right!), she takes time to stretch between more difficult exercises, and shows ways to modify harder exercises.
The booster segment is tricky the first time- and yet I still managed to do it. Although the movements are fast- they are graceful, and the cueing is excellant. This segment is alot like Jody Hoegstedt's ""balletone"" if you have it- only with weights. I definitely got my heart rate up, and felt like I had a good inner thigh workout.
The last segment is titled ""rejuvenation"" and it is a relaxing yoga series. I sometimes skip the booster if I have already done cardio that day, but I *never* skip the final session. It is lovely, and I enjoy seeing how flexible Jennifer is, it gives me something to aspire to.
Some have said this is advanced... This was my second pilates tape (I also have Denise Austins ""Pilates for Every Body- different than this, but loved it, too) and because I am fairly flexible from yoga practises, I did not feel like this was too difficult. I felt challanged, and got a great workout, but did not feel overworked or strained. I felt lifted and relaxed!",1083110400,4,1613,4.723404255319149
1410063,1,B00005A05W,"This is a terrible video.  I enjoy exercise videos but this is one of the worst.  The instructor doesn't stop talking.  It's nice to be guided through postures but she doesn't shut up.  She also takes atleast five minutes of each segment and tells you how to breathe.  It felt like a Lamaze class.  The first segment is Core Conditioning.  It concentrates on your abs and lower spine.  It's not half bad and she does explain things nicely, which is good if you've never done Pilates.
The second segment, Metabolic Booster, is ridiculous.  She's jumping and dancing all over the place.  You'd have to watch it quite a few times to get the moves down.  The last segment, Rejuvination, is based on yoga.  Again, she babbles on for about five minutes then finally takes you through a few common postures.  Thankfully I only rented this video.",1076976000,2,838,4.657534246575342

1410065,4,B00005A05W,"I am not in the best of shape, but I am also what I would consider an beginning to intermediate Pilates student, and I found this workout rather challenging.  This is the first time I have done the DVD.
The first section was not so bad, it got my heart rate going a little and my muscles nice and warm, but the Metabolic Booster section was a KILLER for me.  I sweated and panted like crazy, and I feel incredibly winded after doing the 2 sessions back to back - so winded I am saving session 3 for tomorrow morning.
The metabolic section is SO confusing and fast-moving, like a dance class, that it might take a few times to get it perfect.  I found myself wondering when it would end, and that 20 minutes felt like an ETERNITY.  But I will continue to do it, hopefully the reason it felt like hell is because it is a good workout, and that is what I need.  Sure got me sweating!",1065484800,,880,4.152941176470589
1410066,2,B00005A05W,"Yes, this workout is pretty good.  The yoga and pilates segments are interesting and different, and they really feel effective.  But why hasn't anyone mentioned the terrible video and sound quality??  This DVD looks like it was filmed with a home camera.  The video is grainy, sometimes blurry, and very hard to look at.  It gave me a headache!  The sound is also bad.  At times it sounds like she is talking into a cup.  Also, the Pilates segment has no music until halfway through.
But it's not just that.  She spends a lot of time sitting and talking about the moves you are going to do.  This is great - the first couple times you do it.  After that, you are ready to just get to the workout and not have to sit and listen again.  It's not really convenient to FF, you always go too far and have to back up.
So, although this isn't the worst workout I've ever done (it's actually a pretty decent sequence)  technical problems and slow pace hamper this DVD down.  If someone already has it, go ahead and do it a time or two.  You'll like it.  Just don't waste your money on it, because you won't do it enough to get the value out of it.",1049673600,25,1139,4.227906976744186
1410067,4,B00005A05W,"The first time I did this tape, I did not like it at all, and I did not like Jennifer Kries. I made myself do it again, and for whatever reason, it has now become one of my favorite workout tapes. I think it was probably due to the fact that Jennifer is probably the most flexible person I've ever seen, and those ""smooth"" sit-ups are hard for a beginner, so I just didn't like her!! But now I especially like the last segment for those mornings that getting out of bed can be an exercise in itself! It really energizes you. One of the reviewers said not to do the 2nd segment if you have bad knees. That one is my favorite, but I have noticed some pain in my knees and I have had a RCL ligament replaced in my knee 8 years ago.....
All in all, I think this is a very good tape for people with limited time, and a basic knowledge of Pilates.",1046304000,8,841,4.011904761904762
1410077,3,B00005A05W,"I tried this Pilates DVD, going on a suggestion from a friend that Pilates was the way to go. It focuses a lot on isometric exercises (which I love...see my review for ""Callanetics"") and core control. However, this DVD was not what I was expecting it to be.
Granted, I consider myself to be in pretty good shape, as well as one of those ""freakishly flexible"" people that the Amazon editors call Jennifer Kries, so my review may be biased for the already-in-shape exerciser.  However, this DVD doesn't do as much as it could.
The core conditioning segment focuses on the abdomen and somewhat on the back. Here, I would strongly highlight the Amazon editor's comment about Kries not doing a lot of reps of each exercise. She doesn't. She does maybe 8 and stops. You do feel it in your abs, and then all of a sudden, the workout is over!  Kind of frustrating for someone who likes ab exercises.  If you are a beginner, you will probably find these exercises challenging.  Most are traditional Pilates maneuvers, and each can be modifed to the difficulty level you wish.
The metabolic booster section, meant to be a cardio workout, was more of an exercise in awkward choreography. If you had bad knees AVOID THIS SECTION OF THE VIDEO. She does a lot of lunges, with weights no less, and twisting...you're basically asking for a torn knee ligament.
I admit that Jennifer Kries is a very empathic instructor, and her style is very gentle and encouraging.  It's a good start for a beginner, but if you're in decent shape and are looking for an alternative to a complete body toning workout, this is probably not the DVD for you.  I only use the Core Conditioning segment as a supplement to my current routine.",1043193600,18,1702,4.619205298013245

I don't find her annoying in the least, which is important to me before I've had coffee. On the weekends, I do all three segments.  I really felt it in my abs and legs, while working on flexibility.  The core conditioning section is challenging if you've never done Pilates, but stick with it and you will be amazed at how quickly you progress.  Also, the music is good (Spanish guitar music).

You can see so in the way she cues each exercise, how she demonstrates the advanced and beginner version of each movement and how she aware that it takes time to master pilates and become as flexible as her.  She even takes time to explain breathin techniques although I think this should be a separate short section since it takes a few minutes from the core and rejuvenation workouts and you don't really need to see the explanation everytime.  In this DVD she has three sections core, methabolic booster (good music by the way) and rejuvenation.  Each section is 20 minutes long.

The metabolic booster was more challenging than it appeared when I first watched the DVD. I used five pound weights (with very controlled movement, not momentum), and I was absolutely wiped out by the end. Too bad it only lasts for 20 minutes, or it would be a standalone cardio workout. Jennifer Kreis is a supernice person to invite into your living room for an hour. Her instruction is clear, friendly, and not annoying. I also have the Precision Pilates, which I like very much.

I have neck/shoulder problems and was still able to follow Jennifer Kries instructions and not feel any pain.  She is very detailed when instructing and concentrates on breathing which helps.  The pilates part was a little more interesting...Some of the excercises are very tough, but you definately feel your muscles were worked the next day!  Overall, very well put together.",1026604800,,510,4.839080459770115
1410096,5,B00005A05W,"This video gives a great workout.  Although many of the moves seem quite small and subtle, your abs, legs, and arms get a great workout.  The opening floorwork is challenging but doable, the metabolic workout is a lot of fun and really helps you work up a sweat, and the stretching/cooldown section is a real job.
The style of this video is like a good dance class with clear instructions about breathing properly, feeling centered, and being aware of your body.",1024963200,3,462,4.691358024691358
1410097,5,B00005A05W,"I bought this tape a few weeks ago and have been using it alot.  It is comprised of three segments: A Core Conditioning which is Pilates segment, A Metabolic Boost which is a dance/cardio segment, and a AM/PM Rejuvenation which is a yoga/stretch/relaxation segment.  Jennifer is very clear on how to perform the moves and how they help the body.  She is gentle and encouraging and the moves are challenging.  When I finish, I really feel like my body has been stretched and strengthened.  My posture has changed completely and I feel much more graceful.  I use each segment seperately, the rejuvenation in the morning or evening if I am stiff and sore.  I use this along with Denise Austin's Hit the Spot Abs/Butt pack.  To round out my routine I am going to incorporate Denise's Hit the Spot Bust/Arms pack and a good cardio video.  With this, I definitly don't need a gym membership.",1024963200,4,885,4.658064516129032

1410099,5,B00005A05W,"The DVD has four segments: core-conditioning, metabolic booster, metabolic booster with music only, and am/pm rejuvenation. They're all good, but I like the metabolic booster the best--it's like dancing so it's fun and you don't even realize how hard your body is working. After 20-minutes of the various routines, I'm totally sweating! I love this DVD--it's an essential part of my daily routine. And Jennifer Kries is an excellent instructor.",1022716800,6,444,5.357142857142857

(in fact, I teach a 1/2 hour class of abs)  The second workout ""Metabolic Booster"" was an absolute joke.  Nothing cardio about it.  Finally, the last workout.  It was all about breathing properly.  I know this is hard for some people to do, at first.  This was just ridiculous.  I wish I could get my money back and return it.",1021939200,10,462,4.255813953488372

You'll feel the results the next day! --I love to do this workout. --- There are 3 segments, a revitalizer, a toning section, and a metabolism booster. I find the metabolism booster workout without the talking (she gives you either) is more enjoyable and for some reason makes following the repititions easier when you just watch and follow. -- The instructor is very clear and concise, pleasant to see each day, and is encouraging; no intimidating show-off stunts to make you feel inadequate, just clear and enjoyable leadership.--Definetly worth it!

After 3 months I decided to go to a chiropractor.  He did some adjustments and also said it should go away on it's own.  So I decided to try this DVD.  It worked!!!  I am nearly pain free.  I am not saying that this will help all back pain, but after seeing two doctors this DVD certainly helped.  If you have lower back (Sacrum) pain, and have consulted a doctor, this may be another option for you.  It helped me after 3 sessions.",1019433600,6,585,3.9741379310344827
1410103,4,B00005A05W,"This is a great video and my second Pilates video with Jennifer Kries.  Jennifer is inspiring to watch because of her flexibility. She describes the moves well and is good at encouraging the viewer.  I usually do the whole tape to get a good workout even though it is broken up into three segments.  It begins with good basic floor work to strengthen abs, legs and whole body.  By the middle dance section I am beginning to sweat.  The dance section is fun and challenging.  The end segment is a good cool down.  Each time I do this tape I feel relaxed, long and lean.  Over the next few days I notice that my hamstrings and stomach muscles are pleasantly sore.  My bestfriend said she noticed that I looked more toned after doing this 1-2 times per week than I did when we were walking 20 miles per week.  I've definitely noticed a difference in my stomach and leg muscles.  I have been doing the video for several months and still find it engaging - though I'm purchasing some new ones to help mix up my routine and advance my skill level.",1017273600,,1041,4.369791666666667

1410115,4,B00005A05W,This DVD is an excellent conditioning program.  I have been using it for about 2 months and have received excellent results.  I am gaining strentgh and especially muscle tone.  I feel much better and more flexible.  I especially like this because there is not some annoying aerobics girl trying to get you motivated.  Jennefer Kries is motivating but in a calm and relaxing way. The 3 segments allow you to mix and match which ones you want to do. Try this DVD if you want great results without the high intensity aerobic workout.,1015286400,6,530,4.655913978494624

I just (20 minutes ago, actually) completed the Metabolic Booster Section (without weights, thank you very much!! *grin*) with little trouble.  I was a tad clumsy, and my balance is not so great anymore, but I finished, mildly out of breath, a sheen of sweat, and feeling loose and fantastic!  I couldn't believe the 20 minutes was over already!  When I got up to walk around I felt a little... like jello, but that's a good sign to me, it means my muscles really felt it.  I need a little more stretching when I am done than she gives you, but then, I didn't do the DVD from start to finish either.  Maybe in a couple of weeks...",1015027200,3,798,4.315436241610739

1410118,3,B00005A05W,"This is my first try for Pilates. This dvd (or tape) is divided in 3 categories. First one is the core (abs) part. Very effective. I like it a lot. My abs were burning. I will do this part everyday. The second is the ""metabolic booster"". You need some dumbells to execute it. Well this part is ok to follow but I did't sweat as much as I expected. Maybe I should have heavier dumbells. I guess it is ok in the morning when you don't have too much time, just before going to work. But the stretches are very good. The last part is ""am/pm rejuvenation"" it is a soft mix of pilates and yoga: good for relaxing and stretching at the same time. I do it at night.
To sum up: good core conditioning and stretching DVD. If you want to sweat a lot, buy another dvd.",1011571200,3,756,4.080536912751678
1410119,5,B00005A05W,"As usual Jennifer does a terrific job! Yes it takes a few tries to get the moves down, but with patience it really does come easily. It is not fast-paced, but if you are looking for a good workout that combines cardio and strength training without collapsing a lung, this is it! Your body will move in non-traditional ways, which is a great change from jumping up and down aerobics. You use more muscles, different muscles with this style of exercise.
 When I started working out, I started with the method because it was different, not annoying but still challenging. Now that I workout regularly (cardio weight training, etc..) I still try to use one tape a week of the method to keep my flexibility and agility. Give it a try, it may be the key to keep you on the fitness track!",1008892800,5,781,4.461538461538462
1410120,5,B00005A05W,"I read lots of reviews and descriptions of this tape before I committed to purchasing it.  I was so excited when it finally arrived, and what a great workout it delivered.  I watched most of it before I started so I could get an idea of what was involved, and that helped (although I am so uncoordinated I still don't have the middle segment down yet).
The first section is a classic Pilates routine with some yoga interspersed in the middle.  Yes, you feel it in your abs right when she says your going to.  I like that she shows modifications but also encourages you to challenge yourself.  I probably benefited from learning first with the Ana Caban tapes, but I was able to keep up and try some new things.  I think Jennifer's roll-up variation with the feet flexed is more challenging that with the toes pointed, but I'm going to play around and see which feels best.  The neck pull was a surprise, but I was glad she had some different exercises in there.
The Metabolic Booster section was my favorite.  When I first watched it I thought ""Oh, this will be fine- will it get my heart rate up enough?""  Well, yes it did!  The moves are so pretty and graceful (although of course I'm still learning to get all of the steps down) that you don't really you're working your butt- or should I say glutes?- off.  Again, when she says you should feel this in your glutes, you will.  I love this part!
The Rejuvenation section was a great way to end the workout.  I don't know if it's Jennifer's extra dose of inspiration or if the other two workouts just loosened me up, but I definitely felt my hamstrings loosen up.  For me, that's huge.  I'm pretty flexible (except for the hamstrings) and I've been doing yoga for a while, so I didn't need most of the modifications she introduced, but they didn't bother me, either.
Again, this is a great workout- I recommend it to anyone who wants a total body workout but wants a softer (though not slower) pace.

1410123,5,B00005A05W,"I think this is a wonderful video, the moves although fast, are easy enough to learn once you get your coordination in gear, and Jennifer Kries is very practical and straight forward...one problem though.  I have just started working out and am in poor shape; I could not do 90% of the Core Conditioning, partly because I do not have the muscle strength to even make a semi-decent attempt at these exercises, and partly because I am not flexible plus the extra pounds I carry do not allow me to bend into the stretches as much as I would like to improve my flexibility (imagine putting a pillow between your stomach and legs when you bend forward).  I really like the Metobalic Booster, (love the music!) but I almost didn't make it to the end, I was sweating like a pig, my heart was racing, my legs nearly gave out on me, and I wasn't even using weights! The AM/PM Rejuvination is a really good stretching/wake up the muscles workout, but again, I am not even half as flexible as needed to really benefit from these exercises.  On the positive side, I have had a lot of back problems recently, and after working through the Rejuvination last night and the cardio section today, I can already feel a difference in my back, it doesn't feel so locked up.  I know it is a good thing to reach beyond our limitations, that is how we grow stronger, and this video definitely has me stretching. But I probably would not have purchased this video for beginning workouts had I known the importance of flexibility and basic muscle strength to benefitting from this workout.",995673600,24,1564,4.555160142348755
