4027429,5,B002ZG9990,"The movie, ""The Bounty Hunter,"" starring Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston was far more than entertaining. The movie as a whole was very consistent. It was a good mix, it had comedy, action, and serious moments that were very all well planned. I would go see this movie again and recommend it for everyone!",1271808000,7,307,4.703703703703703
4027430,2,B002ZG9990,"The ads for ""The Bounty Hunter"" proudly declare ""From the director of ""Hitch"". That film was made in 2005 and it is the most memorable reference to entice us to watch this new film? Pretty much, yes. That alone should set off warning signals.

As I sat watching the film, I was just amazed how unfunny it is. Two people who hate each other because of a previous relationship gone badly are now forced to spend time together. There are two major problems with this concept. First, who finds it fun to watch two people argue, fight and hit each other? Second, you know they will get together in the end so there is no suspense in the film. Sounds like a fun time for all, huh?

The other thing that occurred to me is that Jennifer Aniston is just unable to create any chemistry with Gerard Butler. Sure, he is also partially responsible for this, but he is, at least, trying to achieve the right tone for the film. Jovial and lighthearted. Aniston plays Nicole Hurley, a reporter for the Daily News who is trying to uncover a story involving corrupt cops. She is on a mission and very serious, so she doesn't want to let anyone or anything interfere. Unfortunately, when her ex-husband, Milo (Butler), a bounty hunter, receives a job to bring back Nicole, who has skipped bail, she doesn't change her demeanor or outlook at all. She never seems to smile or laugh or flirt. The only time she even approaches this type of behavior is when she is trying to convince Milo that she is interested in him so she can get his gun and break free to continue her investigation. Later, when their relationship reaches that inevitable stage where they are both gaga over one another, she seems like she has stepped into this film from a different movie. It is really strange. She is doing and saying the things you would expect, but since so much time was spent with the other Aniston, this one doesn't connect.

As I sat through this film, I began to think back to other Aniston films. Have I ever seen her create any chemistry with any of her co-stars? In her last film, ""Management"", she never seems to truly love either Woody Harrelson or Steve Zahn's character. Worse, she seems to tolerate Zahn and put up with his shenanigans. This is a good point because a better actress would be able to convince us of why she is putting up with this guy, this loser, and all of his craziness. ""The Break-Up""? Again, fighting with her love interest for over two hours. ""Derailed"". If you are able to look past the extremely unsettling subject matter, a certified piece of crap. But even in this film, she can't make us believe she is in love or in lust with Clive Owen or Vincent Cassell. ""Rumor Has It""? Also a piece of crap. She was okay in ""He's Just Not That Into You"", but because it was an ensemble cast, she certainly can't be called the star and she didn't carry the film. In fact, ""The Good Girl"" and ""Friends With Money"", two small independent films are easily the best she has made but I can't remember any romantic fireworks in either.

There has been a lot of press about the affair Aniston and Butler are having right now. They fell in love on the set and, apparently, are unable to keep their hands off one another, grabbing and touching each other on the red carpet. In front of paparazzi. When promoting this new film... They say that everything old is new again. This is exactly the same type of thing the major studios used to hire hundreds of people to orchestrate, to get publicity for their films. You connect the dots.

Gerard Butler plays Milo, a former cop who now works as a bounty hunter. He seems to have fun with the role, giving his character a certain amount of playfulness and sarcasm. The film opens with Milo chasing one of his skips, a guy playing Uncle Sam in a Fourth of July parade. As Uncle Sam, walking on stilts, walks along with the parade, Milo spots him and starts to chase him. The guy begins running on the stilts and they soon end up in the middle of some cops. Milo makes a smart aleck remark to the cops and they both reveal a high level of animosity towards each other.

Let's return to the director, Andy Tennant. Quick, besides the fact Will Smith starred in the film, name one thing about ""Hitch"" that you remember? I bet many would even have trouble coming up with the name of his female co-star. There are a few reasons why a studio would link a new film with a previous success. Obviously, they want the people who went to see ""Hitch"" and 'loved it' to think they will also love ""The Bounty Hunter"". But did anyone love ""Hitch"" or was it a success because of Will Smith's involvement? That's a rhetorical question by the way. Another reason is because the filmmaker is so brilliant the studio wants all of their devoted followers to know they have a new film coming out. But if a filmmaker is brilliant, they usually have name recognition followed by their last successful film. For instance, ""Shutter Island"" trumpeted ""The new Martin Scorcese film"" or ""From the director who brought you ""The Departed"""". Quite a difference. And the reason for this is Tennant's films are largely forgettable. His most memorable films, ""Sweet Home Alabama"" and ""First Kiss"" are sweet, if extremely predictable pieces of romantic fluff. Nothing he has ever made would make someone say ""Hey did you see this new film from this director, Andy Tennant?""

Instead, we are more likely to say, ""Did you see the new Reese Witherspoon film?""

Thankfully, when someone asks you if you saw the new Jennifer Aniston film you can happily report ""No, thornhill warned me not to.""",1271721600,7,5583,4.52079207920792
4027431,4,B002ZG9990,"Thoroughly enjoyed this action comedy.  The first time I saw it, I think that I was expecting something like The Ugly Truth.  It is not anything like that movie and I think that I was disappointed.  Since that time, I have seen it 4 more times and really liked it.  It has several story lines and it's interesting the way they all come together. I think that Jennifer and Gerard have a great chemistry together.  So many people keep acting as if this is a romantic comedy while there is a facet of that, there are other story lines involving car wrecks, fights,casinos and gun play. I will really be happy when it is released on DVD. As far as I'm concerned, it's a keeper.  It is just entertainment and at this time, I'm really enjoying that.",1271376000,,743,4.386861313868613
4027432,4,B002ZG9990,"This movie was really very funny and it had a good story to go along with the comedy. Granted there was a sappy moment or two, but it was minimal and really was more comedy & action than it was a romantic comedy. I watched ""Date Night"" a few days before watching this movie in the theatre and I definitely like this movie better. Date Night was so one-dimensionable, it just tried to be a stupid, silly comedy and I don't think succeeded very well at it. This movie had a bit of action, a lot of comedy, and a bit of romance. Unlike Date Night, the story in The Bounty Hunter was really pretty good.

The pairing and the acting of both Butler & Aniston was great - there was some great chemistry there. This is a much better ""date movie"" than Date Night, so if you are deciding which one to see in the theatre, I would definitely recommend this one. Enjoyed it!

4027434,1,B002ZG9990,"This movie is horrible. I've waited a few weeks to watch it and the way the two talk in real life and how they're in a real relationship gave me hope that they could use their real relationship experience and chemistry to make this movie work.

Wow was I wrong. This movie consist of two main actors that were not only NOT funny 98% of the time but also they had no chemistry. It is sort of a love story with a twist but the twist was weak and the two main actors had nothing going for them.

Whoever made the commercials that made this movie interesting and help tricked the viewers to watch it aka ME and I'm guessing you guys, I think that guy should be hired in replaced for the director that directed this movie because obviously the commercial guy saw the flaw and in short made it look good in the commercials.

This goes for many movies out there. Disappointed? Definitely. I'm half way through it and I'm close to throwing it out. I really hope their real relationship has a billion times more chemistry than what they showed in this movie because they'll need it....",1269907200,10,1076,4.37
4027435,3,B002ZG9990,"Very entertaining, very enjoyable, I would say this was a strong 3 star.  Gerard Butler (Milo) is a former NYPD cop, who left the job to become a Bounty Hunter.  Jennifer Anniston (Nicole) is a newspaper reporter who is currently on $50,000 bail for assaulting a mounted police officer, or his horse.  And BTW, they were married about 3 years ago, and divorced after about 9 months.  While the movie begins in NYC and is tied to NY, much of the movie takes place on the Atlantic City Boardwalk and around the casinos.

Nicole is investigating a story about a suicide that sounds fishy.  She arrives at court with 4 minutes to spare.  When she gets a call from a snitch, she stupidly runs off instead of going to court.  The judge orders a bench warrant for her and she becomes a fugitive.  The bail bondsman offers Milo $5,000 to go get her.  Because there is plenty of leftover passionate anger between the couple, Milo is only too happy to go after her--besides, he needs the money.  His $11,000 gambling debt is overdue and, well, they break your legs for stuff like that.

Meanwhile, the bad guys don't like Nicole investigating the so-called suicide, so they come after her.  Through Milo chasing Nicole and the bad guys chasing both of them, there is also a wanna-be love interest following Nicole because she made out with him one night while she was blitzed at a party.

I like both these actors and it was good to see them do a movie together.  It's a wild and crazy story.  It's cute and funny, and yes, I would watch it again.",1269129600,21,1537,4.474820143884892

Surisingly I really liked it, if you have a goofy sense of humor you should like it.  As for the idiot that says Gerard curls his mouth to cut down on his accent.....if you know anything about Gerard, you know that's not the case. And in my theatre everyone was laughing so I guess he was just in a theatre with people who had no sense of humor at all. I'm a die hard action movie buff,  and I HATE chick flicks, but this definately was one romantic comedy I'll add to my DVD collection.",1269129600,4,643,4.17741935483871

The parts that tried to be funny were the parts from the commercials so we already knew what was going to happen. I don't know why Jennifer Aniston is so famous. She's hot, but she has no personality. I can't think of one good movie she's done. And Gerard Butler? He shouldn't be in romantic comedies. They all suck. He curls his mouth sideways trying to lose the scottish accent and it sounds ridiculous. He is much better in action movies. I am warning you. STAY AWAY FROM THIS DVD.

4027848,2,B002ZG9990,"Review of The Bounty Hunter
Hot Toasty Rag, June 11, 2017

The Bounty Hunter is the reason some people don't like romantic comedies. It stars two good-looking people (although Gerard Butler is in the midst of his grunge phase) to lure lots of people from their homes during opening weekend. Once seated in the movie theaters, it would be best for the audience to glaze over and focus on the eye candy rather than the plot.

I know that sounded a little harsh, and when compared to other movies each of the stars has made, The Bounty Hunter really isn't that bad. It just isn't great, and given the box office appeal both Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston had at the time, I think everyone expected a little more from their first and only Hollywood pairing. They play ex-spouses, one of which is a bounty hunter and the other is, well, hunted.

If you don't mind sitting through a pretty silly romantic comedy with just as little humor as there is romance, go ahead and rent it. Its not a movie youll walk out of, but youll probably shrug your shoulders at the end of it and sigh, Oh well.",1497225600,,1089,4.435

4028715,5,B002ZG9990,"A romantic comedy worth watching!

Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston have great chemistry in this love-hate tale of love, love lost, and love regained.

Butler plays a bounty hunter, well, actually someone who tracks down people who have jumped bail and he is given the job of a lifetime...to track down his ex-wife who through a series of mishaps ends up on the wrong side of the law.  His job is to bring her in and collect his reward.  Of course things do not go as planned, and all kind of misadventures ensue.

I have to say that my favorite quote in the entire movie is one where Aniston asks him for help, and Butler replies, ""Well, that's a real shame. Because I wouldn't help you if you were the last baby sea turtle dragging your little, tiny body across the burning sand whilst hungry seagulls circled overhead. No, I'd just pull up a chair, sip a pina colada and watch nature take its course.""

I do not consume a regular diet of romantic comedies, but if one is good I am happy to set aside an evening and give one a look.  This film falls in that category.

5 stars for fun and good romantic comedy chemistry",1452124800,,1123,4.365384615384615

4028997,4,B002ZG9990,"The Bounty Hunter

 The teasers for The Bounty Hunter show skip chaser-AKA bounty hunter- Gerald Butler dumping his ex-wife into the trunk of a car.  This is an appealing image to millions of men involved in acrimonious divorce disputes.  It isn't enough to maintain an entire movie, one billed as an action comedy.  It would be more accurate to call it an action, romantic comedy.  The heart of the film is the relationship between the Butler character and his former wife, superbly crafted by Jennifer Aniston.  It is on this basis that the film succeeds.
 A cruel fate, or a bail bondsman with a twisted sense of humor, sends Butler to bring in his reporter ex to face a traffic charge.  She bumped a policemans horse and then failed to show up for trial.  One of the running jokes is her poor driving skills.  She is in the process of investigating a possible homicide that the cops have declared a suicide when she gets nabbed.  A further complication is the angry casino operative that sends goons to collect gambling debts from Butler.
 That accounts for the action part.  The real deal is the two ill fated lovers who try to find their way back to each other.  This is where Aniston shows the depth of her acting skills.  The pair are not teens struck with first love.  The formerly married are fully mature adults with a long history of pain and suffering, not the least of which they have inflicted upon each other.  It takes time to peel back the layers of protection that they each have built around their hearts.  Aniston plays a tough big city gal that is not easily nor quickly persuaded to take one more risk with her ex-husband.  Having bad guys of different casts trying to capture or kill them helps bring them closer in the end.  I last saw Aniston in Failure to Launch and Butler in The Ugly Truth.  I enjoyed both of those films and reviewed each of them favorably.  The chemistry between the two leads and particularly the subtle acting of Aniston allowed me to enjoy The Bounty Hunter even more.
 Director Andy Tennant knows how to build this sort of a film without getting in his actors way.  He oversaw such hits as Hitch and Sweet Home Alabama.  I wish him equal success with The Bounty Hunter.
 This PG-13 rated film has so far grossed a middling $50 million against a budget of $40 million.  There is violence in this movie but no naked folk or horrible language.  It runs a quick one hour and 46 minutes.  It deserves a strong three and a half saw blades.",1436918400,,2485,4.494407158836689

4030036,4,B002ZG9990,"I don't know any of the actors involved so I can't comment on how well they did compared to some other performances of theirs. In general, the two leads are competent but do not have the skill of those in the ""classic"" past who played similar roles: but then, who expects to get a Tracy, Hepburn, Grant, Lombard, not to mention Streisand and others, more recently, playing such roles in a routine movie. The supporting players vary in their comedic personas, but, for the most part, are at about the same level as the Stars.  That said, I enjoyed the film and think that many other viewers would do so as well. The story is ancient in its general lineaments but is done with verve and without those moments of overdoing which create audience embarrassment not pleasure. Yes, the older generation will not understand that showing several days beard is considered 'hot' these days (or, at least, three days ago-these things come and go rapidly) and, I assume without remembering any, that there must be other generation bound behaviors manifest,  but, still and all, I feel it safe to recommend the picture to most who are ready for a knock-about not an intellectual comedy.",1378425600,,1172,4.740196078431373

The jokes were a bit predictable, many of the situations were a bit out there and hard to believe, and I don't feel as though Aniston and Butler were the best of couples.

The acting was fine, Gerard is really good at playing complex characters with bad attitudes that you like anyway. Jennifer was her usual beautiful self who did a decent job in her roll also. There were plenty of laughs in this movie that will split your sides but there is plenty of time between those laughs. Time that makes you sit and anxiously awaiting your next laugh. This time is what really does the movie no justice, while i understand the writers wanted important plot points to be added in but the delays in humor scenes is too big for a comedy often 10-20min. This film does have a cooky romantic story i would say this film is more along the lines of a drama/chick flick than a comedy.

Overall The Bounty Hunter gets 3/5 stars. It isn't bad and i did have plenty of good laughs however those looking for a comedy should keep in mind that while this will make you laugh it is more if a chick flick than a comedy flick.",1353283200,,1030,4.33678756476684
4030638,2,B002ZG9990,"Surprise surprise....yet another unfunny Jennifer Aniston comedy. What is it with this over-pampered, over-paid actress' bad choice in movies? And yet, she continues to bring in the big bucks. Her last ten films since 2006 have grossed $770 Million in profit at the box office. I'm not making this up. People flock to go see her. Why?

The studios put Aniston in their films because they're guaranteed to make a sizeable profit, regardless if the movie is good or not. ""Wanderlust"", her last film, flopped at the box office. Perhaps this is an encouraging sign. Maybe moviegoers have become weary of her films. I certainly have. I took a chance on this one, but should have known better.

Aniston's last good film, ""The Good Girl"", was ten years ago. Before that she appeared in other critically acclaimed films such as ""The Iron Giant"" and ""Office Space"". These films are not rom-com's and perhaps they didn't rake in millions of dollars, but they did garner the actors who appeared in it valuable respect and admiration. Right now, Aniston is pretty much an industry punchline.

Jennifer Aniston can be humorous. So either she's not getting the good, funny scripts, or romantic comedies are not a good vehicle for her comedic abilities. My advice to her would be to take a chance on something different. Forget the rom-com's. Take a risk and perhaps you'll be rewarded with something other than a big paycheck.",1349049600,,1412,4.875

4030736,2,B002ZG9990,"THE BOUNTY HUNTER fizzles without ever being ignited. Sarah Thorp wrote this ambiguous tale and Andy Tennant (who ha done some good movies) 'directed' it and likely the only reason it ever made it into theaters lies in the decision to place name actors in the leads.  That doesn't even help.

Milo Boyd (Gerard Butler, grossly miscast) is an ex-cop turned bounty hunter whose track record is less than acceptable. He lands a chance to redeem his failing career when he is assigned to bring in his bail-jumping ex-wife, a news reporter Nicole Hurly (Jennifer Anniston) whose 'crime' is as foolish as the script. The 'cute twist' is that Milo and Nicole were married but found their commitment to work a barricade in maintaining their marriage.  The rest of the film is Milo chasing down Nicole who happens to be tracking a news story on a criminal and somewhere along the way the two have moments of reconciliation quickly botched by the clumsiness of Milo's bounty hunter abilities and Nicole's investigating warps. The chase becomes more of a stagy thriller than the intended comedy romance - and there is absolutely no chemistry between Aniston and Butler on the screen.

Tiny cameos are embarrassing, even in the hands of actors such as Christine Baranski, Cathy Moriarty, and Gio Perez.  It just doesn't fly.  Grady Harp, September 11",1315526400,,1338,4.898230088495575

4030738,3,B002ZG9990,"For Jennifer Anniston fans, The Bounty Hunter (2010) does at least offer a slight change of pace.  While not quite Knight And Day (2010), there's still enough action to separate the movie from the typical romantic comedy vehicles that Ms. Anniston usually appears in.  At 41, she looks fabulous, nicely tanned, and superbly toned.  The pairing of Anniston with Gerard Butler (300, The Phantom of the Opera), who plays a kind of rough around the edges type, makes for kind of an odd match, and is a switch from the pretty guys she's typically involved with.

Reporter Nicole Hurley (Anniston) is on the trail of a big story involving corruption in the police department.  Ex-cop now bounty hunter Milo Boyd (Butler), is given the assignment of bringing in his ex-wife (Hurley) for jumping bail.  Boyd tracks down his ex at a racetrack and tosses her in the trunk of his car, with the intention of bringing her in.  A short stop in Atlantic City perks up their romance a bit, but Nicole is still on her way to the police station, when an attempt on their lives finally convinces Milo that Nicole might really be on to something.  The couple spend the rest of the film mostly working as a team, reliving their past, and eventually discovering the truth.

Jason Sudeikis, Christine Baranski, Cathy Moriarty, and Carole Kane are among the supporting cast.  The Bounty Hunter isn't loaded with action, isn't hilariously funny, is just passable in the romance department, and has a terrible ending.  The writing isn't very clever, and Anniston and Butler don't seem to have the greatest chemistry together.  The result is a mildly entertaining romp, with a couple of pedestrian action sequences, and a few amusing moments.  Jennifer Anniston is extremely likeable, but remains a talent who has yet to find the ideal vehicle.  Though critically panned, The Bounty Hunter did well at the box office.  If you are an Anniston or Gerard Butler fan, you'll probably want to check this out.  If however you prefer a turbocharged romantic action flick, try Knight And Day (2010).",1312243200,,2064,4.854285714285714
4030739,5,B002ZG9990,"The Bounty Hunter is a pleasant afternoon diversion, a 2-1/2 to 3 (although I gave it five cause I'm tired of it being the poster child for bad movies.)  It's not bad, just not great.  If you like the stars (and I like BOTH Butler and Aniston) it's OK.  It has a lot of cute moments but doesn't gel as a whole for some reason.

That reason, I think, can be laid at the door of the producers/director.  Anytime a film doesn't measure up to people's expectations, critics, bloggers, man/woman on the street always lambast the stars.  Well, there are plenty of stars I don't care for, but I really don't think it's their fault, certainly not here.  The producers choose the script (here mild to say the least), the stars, the budget, the director.  It's their ballgame but they get to fade away and leave the talent holding the bag.

This film was poorly directed.  Yes, I know he's had other successes but here he dropped the ball.  Cute moments are allowed to lay there, the incidental music drains any sense of fun (the songs are cute but the rest is just bad), locations are drab and lifeless and poorly used.  And the fact that the film actually plays a lot better on TV leads me to my second assertion.

The producers/director were not tailoring this film for theaters.  Their sites were set on its perpetual play on cable, it's life on TV.  It is a classy TV movie, already honed to not upset anyone in their living room, tailor made for commercial interuption when that fate befalls it, and cute enough but not too distractive when you have to answer the phone or put the kids to bed - again.

I like Butler, a lot, and I like Aniston.  And if I don't like somebody I don't watch their films nor do I whine about them every chance I get (In other words, those who don't like Aniston - or anybody else - DON'T WATCH HER MOVIES. Sheesh!)  Butler and Aniston are good but too sanitized in this outing.  A little more edge would have helped a lot, a stronger central threat, a sharper paced rhythm (the director again).  I liked the loan collectors a lot, would have enjoyed more of a more energized Baranski - again, the director's use of his resources left a lot to be desired.

For pleasant, mild entertainment, I've developed a certain amount of affection for The Bounty Hunter.  Not the greatest film, perhaps, but a thousand miles from the worst film I've ever seen.  And if you like the stars, it's OK.  LOL",1309737600,4,2415,4.424036281179139
4030740,5,B002ZG9990,"I haven't quite figured out yet just why I like this movie so much but I think I found it to be kind of different, for one thing. Not the same old Jennifer Anniston, playing Rachel Green. Yes, she will always have that type of personality, 'cause that's who she is but I really like the chemistry between her and Gerard Butler for one thing. That's a big deal to me and I like a film where the characters actually grow, learn, change and move on-like they talked about when they had dinner together. Take responsibility for your #*%$ and move on. Also, I appreciated the fact that the few swear words were mild and the little bit of sexual innuendo was pretty tame. I also love Christina Baranski-she's fun no matter what she does but it would have been nice to see her and Anniston have a scene together (on the phone is not doing a scene together). The scene between Baranski and Butler was awesome, they even had chemistry. I also wonder how the actress who played Theresa managed to walk away without fainting when Butler dips her down for a passionate kiss after she hands him a check! Sigh! Now that was hot!
I really love this film. I have a copy that I just put in now when I'm doing other stuff and have it running in the background. It's fun, it's fast, it's clever, and it's crazy. Oh, and most of the violence, directed at Jason Sudekis's, Stewart, is comedic and besides his character deserves it, he plays a dope, but a hilarious dope! At one point, he congratulates himself for something and says, 'Stewart, you a tremendous stud!' Hilarious! He's perfect for the part.

No, this is definitely NOT a suspense- it's a really pitiful attempt at a comedy involving far-fetched and pointless ""bounty hunter"" *comedy* segments- completely unsuspenseful.

Romantic comedy sales are driven by women and women love Gerry and some director somewhere (whoever he was) obviously did not get that women came to see GERRY!  HOT GERRY!  HOT GERRY like the GERRY stripping in PS I LOVE YOU.  So, mistake number one---why isn't GERRY HOT!  Slob Gerry is what we got and---wrong.  Who is running Hollywood?  Why would you pay good coin to have him sloshing around.  The story line would have worked just as well if he had been a classy bounty hunter with a Jaguar who adored his car, made his bounty lick the dirt from it---worked better by the end when his precious Jag is torn to shreds.  He could still have needed money, still have been a gambler with a bad loss and a need for some fast cash.  He could have been in cuff links and white shirts and just plain HOT!  HOT!  HOT!  I kept looking at those tennis shoes and thinking of the Millionaire Matchmaker saying, ""Nobody wants to $%#$ that!""  Now that bathroom scene was what we were looking for.  C'mon!

Jennifer was just wrong for this film---wrong. He needs to be opposite someone who is half-nuts and Jen-Jen is so controlled.

I thought the story line was good---badly filmed, badly directed, badly cast---but I could see it as a really good comedic novel.  I think it could have been a good film.

Having said all of the above---I'm glad I saw it.  I'm giving it 4 stars, even though it probably was under three, but hey---there's Gerry half naked in the bathroom scene---that's worth a star and a half.  (-:

In the case of Butler and Aniston, it's a case of too little, and too much; Gerard Butler is a gifted actor of extraordinary range, but too frequently, he plays comedy on 'auto-pilot', recycling the same performance (there is little real difference between Milo, in ""The Bounty Hunter"", and, say, Mike, in ""The Ugly Truth""). Jennifer Aniston has the opposite problem; she frequently 'takes risks', working to avoid type-casting from ""Friends"", which has resulted in several remarkable performances (""The Break-Up"" is wonderfully nuanced), but here, she resorts to mugging and pratfalls to hide the weaknesses of a shallow script. Baranski (as Aniston's 'cougar' mom), and Kane (as innkeeper at the hotel where Butler and Aniston had spent their honeymoon) are two of America's finest comic actresses, but Tennant largely fails to capitalize on their formidable skills.

Still, I can't say he was made for romantic comedies. He's a macho brute, not that there's anything wrong that, but he lacks charm in films like the Ugly Truth and now the Bounty Hunter. Being a macho brute worked more for him in movies like 300 and Rocknrolla but not romantic comedies.

Seriously, there is nothing here that you can't find in a million other movies, and to be quite frank, it isn't done remarkably well here either.  I'm beginning to understand the complaint that Jennifer Aniston is not a film star.  She is a remarkable sitcom actress, and if she ever decides to delve back into TV I'll be first in line to check out her new show, but there are certain things that don't translate so well from small screen to big screen (see the `Sex and the City' movie for all the details) and there is something about Aniston's personality that fits in that boat of `made for TV'.  It just doesn't read so well on the big screen (she has exceptions, but they are few).  Butler is not a great actor, but he looks good and has an accent so he is obviously `in' right now.  I'd watch him do practically anything, but outside of his looks he doesn't have a lot of appeal (although I found him surprisingly tender in `P.S. I Love You'...why don't I own that movie?).  The plot here is a bit bland.  Why is it that these new romantic comedy marriage flicks all have to involve people trying to kill you; like the only way you can rekindle your romantic relations is if you save each other from death.  It just seems odd to me.  Thankfully that `Have you Heard About the Morgans' movie knew how to handle it better than this film.  It feels clumsy here.  Also, this is a rom-com...nothing more and so I find it off putting that they even try and make a statement about marriage (the whole dinner scene was out of place).  In the end there are some scenes that really work and others that fall flat.  Since when did Cathy Moriarty turn into Kathleen Turner?  That was a letdown.  And `The Hangover' certainly proved that Jason Sudeikis deserves much better than this (he was SOOOOO good in that movie).  Thankfully Carol Kane called Aniston stinky, for that was the only time I truly LOL'd during this movie.",1283126400,4,2060,4.46524064171123

4031209,2,B002ZG9990,"There are a large number of movies released starring big name stars that just never seem to quite live up to their potential. The movie that is, not the stars. And I don't think it's the fault of the stars either. Some would say it's a combination of script, direction and more but in general I don't think its any one item. It's a combination of them all and perhaps just a lackluster idea that seemed better on paper. Such is the case with THE BOUNTY HUNTER.

Gerard Butler stars as Milo Boyd, a down on his luck bounty hunter deep in debt to bookies who never seems to have much luck. Having just caught a bail jumper the end result is a night in jail for torching a parade float on accident while attempting to catch the guy.

Nicole Hurley (Jennifer Aniston) is a hot shot reporter who thinks she's on to a major story. An apparent suicide left behind too many questions that no one seems to be asking. As Nicole is about to go before a judge for an assault charge (what that involves is revealed later and it's not as funny as it should be) when she gets a call from an informant. Since she doesn't show for her hearing, her bail is revoked and she's a wanted fugitive.

Guess who gets to pick her up for jumping bail? Of course it's Milo, who also just happens to be Nicole's ex-husband. Yes the pair had a parting of the ways and one gets the idea that it wasn't an easygoing divorce. No, both parties seem to not think well of the other. And when Milo tosses Nicole into the trunk of his car to take her in, things don't get a lot better.

As the film moves forward, Milo eventually sees the problems that Nicole is having between trying to find clues to her story that might involve a best friend they both share as well as being shot at by someone who wants this story silenced. Along the way he keeps Nicole handcuffed to the bed at night and has to dodge his own problem, the bookies he owes money to. Somehow the only solutions to their problems is to stick together and figure things out.

This is the type of movie where you know from the first scene that a happy ending is just around the corner no matter how many guns are drawn and how many shots are fired. Goldie Hawn made several films in this genre including FOUL PLAY and BIRD ON A WIRE. A combination of agitation between the two main characters, remembering the past, romance, adventure and the chance that someone might separate the characters that were apart for good by the final reel. But that never happens.

Butler is coming along well with his career but his choices aren't always what he probably hoped for. He's taken a chance with comedy in a couple of films now and though he does an excellent job, he seems more suited for things like 300. Aniston has never seemed to make the leap from small to large screen like many actresses. Which is sad because she genuinely does a good job in everything she's done and this film is no exception.

So what's the problem? The directing is fine, the photography well done and the acting, as state, well above par. I think perhaps the problem lies in the script. The two characters reveal so little of themselves in a positive light that you tend not to care about them. You hope they get back together but know so little of them as the story unfolds. The small glimpses you get are very small indeed.

These are characters that we need to feel for, to understand, to want the best for and until late in the film we never have those emotions touched. Instead we witness two self absorbed people who whine about one another and blame each other for everything that went wrong. It's the Bickersons without the humor.

The laughs are short term and unmemorable. The action is predictable. And the whodunit that the movie surrounds itself around to make it all worthwhile isn't nearly as crafty as it would like us to believe.

All that being said, the movie isn't a bad film and definitely worth a dollar rental. Its just not one of those movies that you'll want to sit on the front shelf and pull down now and then. You may enjoy watching these two gifted actors perform well together once, but long term this isn't a movie you'll add to the collection unless you're a die hard Butler or Aniston fan. So enjoy the small amount of entertainment you get from this one and then let it fly.

Not even taking into account the entire Brangelina/Aniston debacle, which makes you want to like her, Jennifer Aniston is a mediocre actress. Long ago, she should have taken the time to give Brad Pitt the family he wanted because the truth is, the blockbuster career she sacrificed her marriage for just isn't happening. She needs to stop doing these so-called ""chick flicks"", which to be honest most of us ""chicks"" don't like. Instead, she needs a good script with substance and depth, that enables her to prove once and for all she can do more than flick her hair, smile sardonically, and be sarcastic.

4031467,1,B002ZG9990,"Most of the other reviewers who did not like this film excellently detailed what was wrong with it plot-wise, so I will go in another direction with this review.  Jennifer Aniston needs to return to sitcom TV.  That is where she shines.  Her excellent comedic delivery just does not translate to the big screen, which is not unusual - lots of television actors just cannot make that transition.  She is a beautiful 40-year old woman, but in this film, her beauty does not come through at all.  Her famous hair looks stringy, her skin is very orange from too much spray-tan, they put way too much pancake makeup on her face so that it was very visible in close-ups, and her normally lighter eyebrows were so thick and dark, I just couldn't get past that.

Now for Gerard Butler.  He plays a former NYPD detective-turned-bounty-hunter.  OK - I just couldn't get past the fact that rather than have a typical New Yorker cop accent (maybe a little Bronx), his Scottish burr came through so blatantly, and the way he gyrated his mouth to try to overcome this I guess, looked to me like he was spitting when he talked!  There are many English, Irish, Aussie and Scottish actors who completely lose their accents when they play American characters.  This guy just cannot.  He is good-looking, yes, but he is not a comedic actor.  As a matter of fact, I just don't see what all the hoopla is about him anyway.  I liked him in Atilla and in 300, but he has done nothing of note lately in my opinion.  His work is on the mediocre side.

Lasty, there was zero chemistry between these two.  Zilch.  Nada.  My recommendation is to completely skip this film.",1280793600,6,1644,4.534013605442177

His ex-wife, Nicole Hurley (Aniston), is a pouty journalist who has just skipped a court appearance and jumped bail for a hot story about a potential murder cover-up.

And by Mr. Smith I mean Brad Pitt.  Hijinks ensue, they reminisce, and yadda yadda yadda.

Watch it on an intercontinental flight and at least you'll pass about two hours.  Nothing is really bad, per se, but nothing stands out either.

When I go to the movies (or in this case, rent one), I want to get lost in the flicker of the lights, the darkness of the theater, with a great, or even just a pretty good story.

But no-o-o-o-, that does not happen here. None of that happens here. Nothing but cynicism, even toward my boy Gerard Butler. And Jennifer Aniston? My opinion is perhaps permanently sealed of her as a bratty, conceited, self-indulgent adolescent. And that hair? Normally, I can admire beautiful hair with the best or worst of them. But her hair? It is so annoying! How many times did she push it away from her face? I found myself even thinking of her hair as straggly!

And my boy? Why that shirt? Since we had to watch the entire movie with Gerry wearing the same shirt, why couldn't he have worn a prettier shirt, not that skimpy, cheap-looking one? And who picked that form-fitting little black dress that we must endure seeing Jennifer wear for the entire movie? Just because she still has a nice-looking figure? My thought: She's wearing it to show off her figure and her tan.

See? It's not the silly plot or tacky vengeful actions each takes against the other that concerns the viewer--it's all these questions. Watching a movie should be an engrossing activity, not one filled with all these questions and thoughts. So, in lieu of a traditional review, I'm listing some:

1. Why in the world did Gerard Butler want to be involved in such a stinker of a movie? Oh, no need to answer. Jennifer Aniston would also star in it. Since Gerry has become such a playboy, having the opportunity of working opposite such an attractive sitcom queen must have been too much to turn down. If the gossip rags are right, the two did spend time together.

2. I wish I had not seen the movie. Now my opinion of Jennifer as a one-dimensional actress is sealed. For the entire movie she is pouty and petulant. Frankly, in this story, she acts like a bratty adolescent instead of a professional journalist. She was never convincing. In fact, she exudes desperation and sorrow and loss. At least, that's my opinion.

3. That shirt and that black dress. I really tired of seeing them. Here's my question: Were the shirt and dress washed daily for the next shoot (yeah, right), or were there racks of black dresses and skimpy, plaid shirts lined up, waiting for the next day?

4. Two scenes with Jennifer: running in high heels? A double? And pumping away on that big tricycle in a short dress and high heels. Not believable and certainly not funny. More so, sad and pitiful.

Well, you get the idea. I don't even know why I'm giving two stars. Generous, I guess. I didn't even realize how much I did not like this movie until I stayed the night at my mother's house.

4031542,2,B002ZG9990,"""The Bounty Hunter"" is an example of a good Hollywood-made romantic comedy turned into a dull one. The film, directed by Andy Tennant (responsible much better ""Ever After"" and ""Hitch""), stars Gerald Butler and Jennifer Aniston. Butler is a cop-turned-bounty hunter Milo, whose newest assignment is to capture Nicole, a reporter working for a local paper - and she is his ex-wife - who has jumped bail to go after a story. While tracking down his divorced wife, Milo himself gets involved in the case Nicole is determined to investigate. And as you know, Nicole and Milo hate each other at first, but then something romantic happens again between them before the film reaches its inevitable conclusion.

Don't get me wrong. The film's storyline is predictable, but it is fine with me. What annoys me here is the filmmakers added so many unnecessary things to the already contrived story that should have been much simpler. There is a subplot about Milo's gambling debt that goes nowhere. There is another subplot about Nicole's coworker Stewart (Jason Sudeikis) that is unfunny and embarrassing. As to the ""story"" Nicole investigates, it is simply boring.

Even those who can ignore the weak story will be disappointed with the poorly-written characters Milo and Nicole. The two players themselves Gerald Butler and Jennifer Aniston are as attractive as ever, doing their best to save the film. Still the characters they play remain uninteresting throughout. Director Andy Tennant did a better job in ""Hitch,"" but his latest film lacks the charm and wit of the delightful Will Smith character.

It seems ""The Bounty Hunter"" has borrowed so much from classic films as ""The African Queen"" and, more recently, ""Midnight Run."" Sadly they didn't borrow what is most needed: a decent story and more interesting characters we can relate to.",1279929600,2,1832,5.059602649006623

Even if it involves this absurd journey where two people who start off hating each other are thrust into a tight bind and need each other to survive.

The Bounty Hunter, starring Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston is just another comedic romance.  The film tries to develop the story by introducing suspense and mystery as to why the bounty hunter who is chasing his ex-wife is suddenly being hunted himself.

It has an identity crisis that never fully lives up to anything more than just another comedic love comedy movie.  There are too many movies and I would only recommend if your a fan of both Aniston and Butler.",1279324800,2,847,4.72108843537415

There were some snappy dialogues but the the movie as a whole fell flat.  Weren't Aniston and Butler rumored to have a romantic relationship off screen?  Where was that spark onscreen?

The story was full of holes and painful to watch in spots.  Just know that it follows the usual formula of boy and girl fall madly in love, they break up, boy and girl are forced back together, they are chased by bad guys, and then boy and girl fall back in love. The end.

What was the best part of this film?  That would be Jennifer Aniston's co-worker at the Daily news who had a thing for her.  Very funny stuff but that still left 100 minutes of the film to suffer through.  My recommendation is to give this one a miss.",1279152000,3,1367,4.921397379912664

4031631,1,B002ZG9990,"n a year where American film audiences have been flocking to sub-par romantic comedy action hybrids, I'm happy to say that we have not done any worse, any more unrealistic, any more unlikable, any more unromantic, any more farfetched, or any more unfunny than The Bounty Hunter. In fact, it's probably one of the worst films of 2010.

Jennifer Aniston plays Nicole, the bail-jumping ex-wife of Gerard Butler's Milo, a fired cop who has since become a bounty hunter. He takes the assignment to pick his ex wife up, and take her to jail. But, somewhere down the line, a bunch of incomprehensible mumbo-jumbo about a murder, a cover-up, and other scoff-worthy cliches cause the two of them to flee, and of course, romance ensues, and it leads the two talented stars into the clutches of rom-com hell.

This is a film that simply tries too hard to be funny, exciting, romantic, and entertaining. It is entertaining for about the first half-hour, and then starts a downward spiral from which it never recovers. It's a shame that Jennifer Aniston, who has been in top form, for the past five years, giving glowing performances in every film she's been in (Friends With Money, The Break-Up, The Good Girl) chose a dud like this. I'm glad to say that her comic gifts have yet to leave her, however her ability to pick a good one seems to be long gone.

The characters in this film could have been so well-written and so interesting, but unfortunately, the lazy writers didn't know what to do with them, and it makes me wonder how detailed the script was anyway. While Aniston's character was somewhat interesting in the film's first act, Butler's character was the most revolting stereotype that I've seen in a film this year. He played the jackass. No more, no less. His character didn't take one unexpected move, or one unforeseen turn.

The one redeeming quality that this film had lied in its supporting cast. Curb Your Enthusiasm's Jeff Garlin and Christine Baranski have about five minutes of screentime a piece, and they bring more life to the table than the rest of the cast does in a painful 110 minutes. While Butler should just stay as far away from the romantic comedy genre as possible, and while Aniston simply needs a better manager, they both look as attractive and gorgeous as ever. There's nothing else for either of them in this disaster, however.",1279065600,24,2358,4.7299270072992705

I insist that there was chemistry between Aniston and Butler.

Now to the DVD.

Despite the well-deserved reviews, I bought the DVD hoping for something salvagable. At least a gag reel. Didn't happen. There's only a few extras and they disappoint.

The Making Of has very little content about making the film: it's mostly an overlong valentine featuring cast and production staff going on about how ""fun,"" ""creative,"" ""talented"" and ""funny"" everyone else is. It's as if they all got handed the same script.

The other featurette is about location scouting. Seriously. You can look at it their way: TONS of places! So many places! Or most people's way: New York and Atlantic City.

There's a ""how to elude bounty hunters"" which comprises a very short set of clips, so I'm guessing it was intended as a web ad for the film.

And finally there previews for other films that may or not be better than this one. (I skipped it, like I always do.)

The full retail price MIGHT have been justifiable had there been good or numerous 'extras.' If you must have it, get it on sale or used.",1279065600,2,1200,4.553488372093023

4031636,3,B002ZG9990,"This movie was decent to watch but wouldn't want to own it. If you like movies with a believeable plot you probably don't want to watch this. There were a lot of plot holes and things that happened that were not very believeable. A good example is that a bounty hunter drove off in a honeymooner's car just to caputre his ex-wife. I mean seriously people? He's not a cop so it's not like he can just legally ""borrow"" someone's car. So, yeah, he would be looking at grand theft auto here!

Not to mention any moron would just pay bail for his ex-wife instead of hitting a police officer to get put in the cell next to her! Besides he might be there for maybe a day next to her until, what do you know? It's time to transfer you. Besides  how is it that you being in jail going to help her? And not to mention that she'll probably get off without much time considering what she did to get put in jail. He just plain slugged an officer in the jaw!

4031640,2,B002ZG9990,"Do you know what it is like to go to the fair and play one of the carnival games?  Maybe the sharpshooter game.  You take your rifle and get your ten shots missing everything, not winning a single prize.  That is what I felt like when I watched ""The Bounty Hunter"".  It was painful to see two actors that I actually enjoy on most occasions fail so miserable at the attempt to create any on screen chemistry.  Setting aside a couple of laughs on occasion the movie had no depth, little plot and nothing endearing.  It was difficult to watch at times.

Nicole Hurley (Jennifer Aniston) is a reporter for a local newspaper.  She is divorced from Milo Boyd (Gerard Butler) who used to be a top notch detective, but is now a local bail bondsman.  He was fired from the police force for doing something that was never really clear.  The two of them dislike each other immensely.  You can guess most of the plot from here without me going too much further but alas, it is what I do.

Nicole, since she is a woman, can't drive that well and grazed the horse of a mounted police officer.  She was set to go to court but missed her designated time.  After several extensions from the judge she finally had her bail revoked, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.  Milo was assigned the case to bring her in for the sum of $5,000.  Damn, I would track somebody down for that much money.  Nicole, found herself not only being tracked by her ex-husband Milo but she was now also being stalked by some vicious killers.

She had been working on a new story about a suicide that didn't actually seem like a suicide.  When she got to close to figuring something out, she found herself on the run.  Milo and Nicole devote most of their energy fighting each other in the beginning, but after both of their lives are threatened they pull forces to fight the bad guys.  They bicker, fall in the water at a golf course, rip a bed apart and end up falling back in love.  It makes you wonder what happened the first time around to make them hate each other so much.

I happen to like romantic comedies.  I like Jennifer Aniston.  I like Gerard Butler.  I didn't like this movie.  As I left the theater I wondered what ever possessed me to walk in to begin with.  It was grossly disappointing.  I would give it a couple of stars for a few laughs and just for old times' sake, but I sure hope these two don't make another movie together for a long time.  Sometimes on screen chemistry works and sometimes it just needs to be saved for real life.  Uhhhhh, well, maybe that didn't work either I guess.

I will say this; Jennifer Aniston still has some of the best legs of any woman any age.  They are just flat out gorgeous.",1272672000,11,2698,4.3107569721115535
