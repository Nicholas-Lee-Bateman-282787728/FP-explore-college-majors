7889194,3,6305378452,"The Chris Benoit-Mike Enos match was dull with Benoit basically wrestling himself. The Norman Smiley-Chavo Guerrero Jr match while good,it was also too long for it's own good. The Fit Finaly-Van Hammer match was BORING. I mean this was Junior boring. The Wrath-Bam Bam Bigelow match while not bad,the crowd didn't give a hoot. The Konnan-Lex Luger match was so-so. The Loser wears a dress match between Perry Saturn & Chris Jericho was not great but pretty good. The 4 corners match for the Cruiserweight title(Billy Kidman vs Re Mysterio Jr vs Juvi Guerrera vs Psicosis) was also not great but pretty good with excellent spot-work to boot. The Ric Flair/David Flair-Barry Windham/Curt Henning tag team match was so-so too. The Tazer/Ladder match between Bill Goldberg & Scott Hall was mediocre at best. I give this PPV a 5 out of 10.",1357257600,,834,4.880281690140845
