8639383,5,B00I5E963U,"A powerful, well acted & moving drama that enlightens & lightens up in moments of levity. Explores the harsh realities of having your past control your future as well as how we use our moral compass to guide us in life & especially through friendship. This film for me is a ""Rocky"" for all those people who feel marginalized by their lack of success early on in their lives only to come to terms with a more hopeful present & future.",1410998400,5,433,4.3580246913580245
