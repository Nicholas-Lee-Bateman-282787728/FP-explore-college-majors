7841175,5,6303201024,"Plot:  The Enterprise is going to have a battle simulation in order to help train people for the coming Borg incursion (it's good that they show that Starfleet is actually preparing for this and that it's doesn't get shoved under the carpet until ""Best of Both Worlds"").  So, the Enterprise is going to test some of the crew by sticking them aboard the retired USS Hathaway (which doesn't have warp drive) and do a mock battle.  With warning (although, I think we can forgive the mistake) a Ferengi Marauder cripples the Enterprise with plasma bursts...

Pretty good episode.  It's fun to see everyone try and basically rebuild the museum-piece Hathaway and also that the reason for the whole mock battle was based on the incoming Borg.  The only complaint is that the mock battle (if I remember correctly) was in Federation space.  So the Ferengi battlecruiser appearing suddenly begs the question, ""What was that Ferengi captain thinking?  He could start a war between the Federation and the Ferengi Alliance, whom the latter would probably lose.""  Otherwise, pretty good.

Strong 4 out of 5 stars.",1158364800,,1100,4.929347826086956
7841176,3,6303201024,"Later to make himself known as ""Quark"" on DS9, Armin Shimerman dons the lobes of Ferengi commander ""Bractor"" in this episode from the series' second season. This was not the first time that the actor portrayed one of big-earred aliens, having assayed similar and distinctive characterizations in two earlier installments.
The story is rather routine and not among the show's best but it's worth a look for the development of Ferengi as pivotal characters in the Trek mythology.",1074816000,,477,5.128205128205129
7841177,4,6303201024,"Starfleet has sent the legendary Zakdorn strategist, Sirna Kolrami, the Third-level Strategema Grand Master to overseer a simulated war game.  On one side we have the Enterprise, commanded by Captain Jean-Luc Picard and his trusted Android Second Officer Commander Data.  On the other side we have Commander William Riker, supported by La Forge, Worf and Wesley, in the Hathaway, an eighty-year old starship that does not have warp drive.  Sounds really fair, huh?  This would be a really good test for Picard and the Enterprise, especially with the Borg on their way from the far ends of the Star Trek universe.  Okay, the set-up is somewhat lame, but Riker and his wily crew sure have fun coming up with all sorts of tricks to help even the odds.  Then, just to make things interesting, the Ferengi show up and cause trouble.  This episode is a bit above average, and even though nothing significant happens it does show the crew being innovative and having fun.  Clearly a couple of key elements in the show's second season was not only showing the crew as highly functional but also establishing them as becoming more of a family.  In these regards ""Peak Performance"" helps solidify both elements.",972950400,2,1201,4.876847290640394
