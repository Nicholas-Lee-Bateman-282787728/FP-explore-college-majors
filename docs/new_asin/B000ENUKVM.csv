8111674,5,B000ENUKVM,This anime is funny. They're afraid of ghosts. There's some wierd stuff with poltergiests. The alchemy aspect is kinda wierd but enjoyable. A well rounded script for anime. This is meant for adults so don't get this for your 4 year old. It's not meant for kids.,1298764800,,261,4.574468085106383

8111676,5,B000ENUKVM,"*Yes* you will read this same review on each of the DVDs for this series. I do not own them all as of yet, but have seen the series in it's entirety.

I am absolutely impressed with this show. The first time I watched any of it, I was not the least bit interested. I'm a definate anime fan, however, I'm very select about what I choose to watch (no sailor moon, or pokemon for myself thanks!). My original take on this show was that it was over-hyped and childish. At the time I was involved in another set of shows and was content, but when I finished those shows this series was rerunning from the beginning on cartoon network's adult swim, so, with nothing else to watch I thought I would give it another chance.

This time I fell in love with it, it has become one of my favorite anime's to date! The story is very indepth, and detailed. There isn't near as much ""fan-service"" as in other shows which can take away from the show itself, and it has relevant undertones.

I am a fan of shows like Cowboy Bebop, Trinity Blood, Trigun, Big O, FLCL (Fooly Cooly), Samuria Champloo, and such. If you share similar interests, then you may very well enjoy this show!",1169769600,,1162,4.321100917431193
8111677,5,B000ENUKVM,"This is an amazing series, with such a powerful theme and just enough comedy to lighten the mood.

What keeps me interested and amazed by this series is that it can appeal to a wide age range and the plot is rich enough to create a positive explosion of thought and reflection.  The bond between the brothers is inspiring and the loyalty that the """"military dogs"" have for the major is artistically shown in this DVD.

I won't go into detail about the episodes since, lots of others have done so eloquently, but I hope that this is enough to persuade you into buying the entire collection.",1156896000,,589,4.485981308411215
8111678,5,B000ENUKVM,"This show is one of the greatest anime shows available. The characters are good, as well as the story line. A very engrossing show for people of all ages.",1154563200,2,154,4.344827586206897
8111679,4,B000ENUKVM,"The first episode on Volume 10 focuses on a more comedic aspect of Fullmetal Alchemist that has gradually dwindled from the anime but has been present in the manga of this title from the beginning. This abrupt switch in gears in Episode 37 which spotlights Colonel Mustang in a ghost hunting expedition right out of Scooby Doo doesn't mix at all with the more tragic bent of the show and comes off as a too little to late homage to the manga. Episode 38 follows Winry and the bookworm Sciezka as they wiretap the phone of King Bradley's secretary, a woman that was supposed to have died many years ago! The last two episodes go back to Ed and Al as they arrive at the ruins of Ishbal and learn about the role of the Chimera in that war from Marta, one of Greed's ex-minions that was crossed with a snake and is seeking revenge against the military establishment that killed all her friends.

I thought the comedy episode was really weak. It's too late to bring in the laughs now as a bunch of lives touched with tragedy are coming to a meeting, and with some dark secrets of the past being revealed, the humor is even less welcome. After that throwaway, the other 3 episodes made up for the non-beginning. The writers of the show are starting to get to the humanity of the characters, most ironically, with the Homunculi, if that makes any sense. You get the sense that the characters paths are set, and they have to do what they have to do and not look back. Whether it's Scar, Ed, Al, Winry, Mustang, or the Homunculi, they all have a reason and a goal they are trying to achieve, even though some of their dreams will lead to the deaths of whole nations. Great show.

I would also recommend the anime Scrapped Princess and Cowboy Bebop. Also the manga version of Fullmetal Alchemist.",1152230400,,1786,4.442073170731708
