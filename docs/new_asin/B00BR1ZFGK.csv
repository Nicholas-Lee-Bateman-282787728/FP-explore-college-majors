8573024,5,B00BR1ZFGK,Alperoviz is one of the few I have read or heard who has ideas about what should replace the uncontrolled capitalism which is wrecking this country. I have talked to one of my friends who is a retired economist and he highly recommends Gar Alperovitz.,1386547200,,251,4.6
8573025,5,B00BR1ZFGK,"I heard about Alperovitz on NPR, googled him finding a five minute video, and had this DVD within a week.  I immediately bought his book  What Then Must We Do? and have benefited from his clear summary of the problems that face America and the solutions.",1371427200,,254,4.5

8573027,5,B00BR1ZFGK,"I saw the trailer to this movie on Vimeo and was blown away, so I bought it on through Amazon and had it arrive at my house three days later. The film didn't disappoint--I set up a screening for friends on Facebook and Eventbrite, and used the movie's website resources to do a discussion afterward.

The film is great because it gives people an analysis of what the long term trends of the U.S. economy are (stagnating wages, environmental destruction, rising inequality) and how they affect American politics. The most important thing, though, is that it offers solutions. As communities around the country build up economic power through practical initiatives, Alperovitz shows how that can translate into progressive political power, and hopefully a way to break open the corporate stranglehold that's preventing us from dealing with climate change, a bloated financial sector represented by Wall Street, wasteful and exclusive health care, and wealth inequality. Alperovitz says that the top 400 people have more wealth than the bottom 185 million of us combined! We should all be thinking about how to deal with that as the major obstacle to real democracy in America.

After the movie my friends and I did some brainstorming, and we're thinking of moving our money to a local credit union and seeing whether we can influence its governance to invest in low income areas in the city. The worker co-ops in Cleveland were exciting to learn about too. It gave us an idea about how our food co-op can be more involved in outreach. We're going to see if it can partner with the local public schools to offer healthy, local alternatives to mass produced junk food that's trucked in and wastes carbon while not contributing to local jobs. Alperovitz thinks that these efforts to displace corporate power can build up, as they already are all over the country, and hopefully set the stage for the ""next American revolution"". Highly recommended!",1364774400,7,1942,4.972307692307692
