1958731,4,B0000YEDLI,"I have to agree with Ivy Lin on most counts, -I usually find her reviews objective and helpful,- I'd just like to add a few comments of my own. First, about the sound. Either the orchestra was playing off-key, or there is a great deal of distorion on the soundtrack. (Perhaps both.) The picture is typical of a 1950s movie and would have been ok, if it were of uniform quality. Unfortunately, portions of the film used for the transfer are worn and others have been ""burned"" (exposed to too much light). I don't complain, though. This is a historical document and I'm glad to own it in any shape.

Of course, what makes this dvd worth having, is the presence of Maya Plisetskaya. Her Odile is unforgetable, -I don't think I'll ever fully enjoy another ballerina in the part, after having seen this demonic seductress she brings to life! But, -and here I have to disagree with Ms Lin,- I also found her Odette superb. Unusual, yes. Unique, definitely. This is not the gentle, delicate princess we expect to see in the Swan Lake. Plisetskaya's Odette is a tormented, frightened, tragic being. To watch her is shocking, but also wonderful. Seeing her here, gave me an idea of how 1950s' audiences must have felt when they heard Maria Callas turn those famous bird-like coloratura roles into dramatic parts. I'm not saying that this is how Odette should be performed from now on (and how could it, after all, unless another Plisetskaya came along?) But I can not put her down because she does not conform to our preconceptions of the role. Her interpretation is unconventional, but quite valid (Odette IS tortured and frightened and anguished,) and I think it's great that she chose to use these emotions, which are often brushed aside in favor of superficial gracefulness, as a basis for her portrayal. It's been two days since I first saw her and I still can not break the spell.",1173916800,9,1877,4.670694864048339
1958732,5,B0000YEDLI,"Historic performances must be evaluated utilizing entirely different criteria from those applied to contemporary works.  To judge a recorded performance from the past using modern audio-visual standards is to entirely miss the point of historic art preservation.  Even precious snippets of performances, however poor the quality, enable us to time travel back to an earlier era in which artistic practices were markedly different from today's.  These differences, however, in no way diminish the gifts and genius of earlier talents.

These older and sometimes extremely rare artifacts are a spectacular opportunity for those of us who appreciate having these otherwise lost cultural treasures salvaged and preserved.

In this case, we have the legendary Maya Plisetskaya - youthful, beautiful, and phenomenally flexible, charismatic and dramatic, in the quintessentially Russian Swan Lake.

The sound and picture quality are by no means inadequate.  It is a stunning experience just to be able to see Plisetskaya in her milieu at the Bolshoi, creating two completely different characters - one vulnerable, magical, the other seductively evil and predatory.  Her gracefulness, her almost supernatural ability to incarnate the soul of a bird, make the cuts and audience shots irrelevent.

In fact, for those who truly appreciate history - cultural and political as well as artistic - this video is priceless.  We see the Soviets at their propagandistic best.  It's as if we're seeing two videos - one an historic ballet performance starring one of the 20th century's immortal artists, the other an adroitly executed and subtle propaganda film - in which the well-groomed, appreciative audience from all classes in this classless society is as much a part of the performance as the dance.

Besides Plisetskaya, the other stars of this film are the audience and the stage crew: beautiful young intellectuals mingle with sturdy loyal Party members.  The less elegant but apparently no less artistically informed workers, both in the audience and behind the curtain, seem to appreciate ballet as much as the intelligentsia in the boxes.  We even see Maya, behind the scenes, relieved and gratified to receive the loving approval of the woman who helps her change her  costume.  After all, in this vast Marxist experiment, all comrades are equal....

The conducting of the Bolshoi orchestra is excellent.  The dancing is consistently superb.  The jester has the outstanding athleticism and power we associate with the Russian school.  The Rothbart plays out his death scene with such dramatic potency that the audience explodes with spontaneous applause.

Yes, there are cuts; yes the film quality is not Hollywood.  But to have the opportunity to view Plisetskaya at the Bolshoi, in her youth, in the stellar role of her career is priceless. I highly recommend her autobiography ""I, Maya Plisetskaya"" which candidly and passionately tells the story of the grinding struggles even artists at the highest levels were forced to survive in the Soviet Union.",1118448000,31,3047,5.343815513626835
1958733,2,B0000YEDLI,"Almost every other dvd with Plisetskaya is superior to this one.  Maya Plisetskaya ia a great dancer and well worth seeing and studying, but if you want to see her dance, see ""Plisetskaya Dances"",""Anna Karenina"", or her version of  ""Carmen"".  This Swan Lake is very poorly presented.  The only reason to purchase this dvd is if you must have a sample of her Odette/Odile, then go ahead, but don't expect much.",1115251200,3,409,4.71830985915493
1958734,2,B0000YEDLI,"Plisetskaya deserves 5 stars but this is a very poor ballet film
The first act is heavily cut and there are too many shots of the
audience even in such important scenes as the second act and black swan pas de deux and also many shots from the stage showing
the back of the dancers and the theater. The audio and the video are poor.",1084233600,13,331,4.107692307692307
1958735,4,B0000YEDLI,"I adroe Maya's artistry but this recording is not doing her justice. Very poor cameramanship ! They rather shot faces of audience than showing her dnacing in many occasions. ( It was probably a Soviet propanganda at that time to show how beautifula nd well dressed the audiences were ! ).Maya's tecnique was solid but not too expressive in this performance. The dying swan bonus is a jewel. I also recommend this only for historic reasons. Otherwise,the Makarova and Ananiashivili recordings are my favorites.",1073692800,11,509,5.071428571428571
1958736,5,B0000YEDLI,"This is a historic ballet film from the fifties. Notably the sound and video is not first rate. It is not recorded as a live performance per se. There are cuts here and there to the performance.
In spite of the sound and video quality, I thoroughly enjoy the dancing of Maya Plisetskaya. I am not a ballet expert, but I also own the Kirov (with Galina Mezentseva) and the Nureyev versions. In my opinion, among the three, Maya is the best Odette/Odile, followed by Galina. Her whole body can dance - her legs, arms and face. The Russian dancers seem to have more facial expressions which make them look more ""into"" the role, enhancing the effectiveness of their performance.
If you want a complete Swan Lake, this may not be the DVD for you. This DVD is recommended for its historic value.
For more info, please see reviews of the same film in VHS format.",1073260800,9,855,4.487179487179487

8004363,5,B0000YEDLI,"My mother asked me to buy her every version of Swan Lake I can find by the Russian ballet. I found 3 versions on Amazon.
The videos are good quality and she loved all the productions.",1483401600,,183,4.111111111111111
8004364,5,B0000YEDLI,"This is simply Russian ballet at its most beautiful and most dramatic.  There could never be a ballerina more beautiful, more technically accomplished and more gifted dramatically, all at one, than Plisetskaya, as demonstrated in her effortless transition from Odette, tragic, tormented and terribly vulnerable, to Odile, blatantly sexy and triumphantly malevolent.  Nor could there be a danseur noble more classically handsome and athletic than Fadeyechev.  And Levachev also provides an impressively athletic and genuinely scary Rothbart, despite make-up grotesque to the point of comedy.  One might well feel infuriated by the occasional shifts of view from the dancers to the audience, though one might be touched by their evident adoration of Plisetskaya and certainly by the scene where she comes off stage as Odile, relaxed and smiling (!) and reaches out to touch the shoulder of her dresser, who has presumably just told her that she wasn't bad at all that time.  Simply a treasure.",1422835200,,991,5.326923076923077
8004365,1,B0000YEDLI,"Bought this for an elderly friend who likes ballet.  The date on the description is 2003.  Nowhere in the descriptiopn does it say that it is an old 1957 soviet recording.  For those who aren't ballet aficionados the description is poor and misleading.  I'm not in a position to judge the ballet performance, but the description gets only 1 star.",1419811200,,346,4.716666666666667
8004366,1,B0000YEDLI,"The reader should be warned that this is not a full ballet and that the photography is poor.  The audience is panned almost 20% of the time,
even during the  dance.  I wanted to see Maya, not the applauding audience.  Save your money.",1418947200,,234,4.372093023255814
8004367,5,B0000YEDLI,"Not only does this DVD feature the exceptional dancing of Maya Plisetskaya etc., but it is the main document for the conducting of Yuri Fayer, conducting which not only brought out the nature of Tschaikovsky's music but also was keyed to the exact movements on stage. Fayer's skill & understanding of what was needed onstage were greatly appreciated by the Bolshoi's ballerinas & leading men. Fayer conducted ""Swan Lake"" over 400 times; this 1957 film was made not long before his retirement. His audio recording of Coppelia with the Bolshoi Orchestra (on YouTube) can also be recommended.",1396224000,,589,5.082474226804123
8004368,4,B0000YEDLI,It should be essential viewing for anyone studying ballet to see this Version of Swan Lake. Not for nothing has she been touted as the greatest exponent of this ballet.,1375315200,,168,4.633333333333334
8004369,3,B0000YEDLI,"Even with consideration for its age, 1957, this film is in poor condition.  The lighting wavers at times.  On close shots one can tell it was shot in color on the more distant shots the color seems to fade.  There are very abrupt cuts and some of the performance appears missing.  In one act the stage is washed out by overexposure; the sound is adequate.  There are some very poor choices by the video director, particularly in the last act where too much time is spent showing audience reaction shots.  However, the production is lavish and Maya Plisetkaya's interpretation of the Odette/Odelle role riveting.  The character of Rothbart is handled beautifully with a half man/half bird costume.  The ending is the happy one in which Rothbart is killed and Siegfried and Odette are re-united.  This is an ending that I personally find most satisfying.",1300320000,,852,4.861111111111111
8004370,3,B0000YEDLI,"Having been lucky enough to have seeen Plisetskaia in Carmen (in Buenos Aires), I was so looking forward to this DVD.Pity the filming and sound are so bad, plus the fact that the cameraman kept showing faces of the audience during critical passages; the ""tempo""of the first and 3rd.acts way too fast. But you can still see her splendid Odette/Odile. I can only imagine what it would have been if had been filmed as it should. Anybody who has seen The Red Shoes (filmed in the40""I believe)knows what good ballet filming is.",1213401600,2,522,4.684782608695652
8004371,5,B0000YEDLI,"Yes, it has all sorts of irritating cuts to the audience, but after many viewings I became interested in what people looked like all dressed up in the late 50's in Moscow. I began to imagine what it must have been like to go to that theater and see these dancers and to see Maya. They say that Stalin went to secretly watch Maya dance the Swan Lake and the next day he died. So it seems that her dancing had the magic to slay the dragon.

I am so glad that I bought this; I wish that it wasn't butchered but it is and I still savor it any chance I get. It is the best Swan Lake I have ever watched despite all the flaws so well described in the other reviews.",1212019200,3,659,3.917910447761194
