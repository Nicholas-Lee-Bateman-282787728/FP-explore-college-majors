2246369,4,B0007WFY5W,"This is a great film about life thriving in the most extreme, desolate conditions known to man, perfectly demonstrating how life always reconciles with its environment to establish a relationship of coexistence.

The film begins with a steady descent for miles and finally exploring the colonies of living creatures betrayed by the light of the sun and ostracized by normal marine life only to find sustenance in the toxins discharged by the stomach of our earth's core.

Another positive value to this feature was the calming energy it instilled inside me. It was a great film to watch before bed.",1277856000,,598,4.97
2246370,5,B0007WFY5W,"I found this documentary to be really fascinating, and not just because of what they uncovered in the depths of the ocean. The conditions that exist where these creatures have been thriving are brutal. It is a true testament to the fact that life can ""always find a way"".

This leads to the part that would excite anyone who is interested in the possibility that life has been able to exist on another planet (or satellite of a gas giant). Yes, I admit to being a nerd.

In short, this is a great documentary and the information it contains has ramifications that can fascinate people who may not necessarily have an interest in the bottom of the sea.",1271808000,,651,4.508474576271187
2246371,1,B0007WFY5W,"This is not worth the purchase for an educational DVD.  I would not have wasted my time and money with this DVD, if I knew what I know now.  It is to bad that there is no refund program.",1270771200,,186,3.7435897435897436
2246372,5,B0007WFY5W,"I have never taken the time to write a product review, probably because I never sat down and was shockingly amazed at how beautiful the picture of a particular movie was. This video on blu-ray is well worth its price. I loved it and cannot imagine ever not recommending it as a first choice, underwater video.

This is a MUST-SEE!!!!",1268611200,3,333,4.55
2246373,5,B0007WFY5W,"I bought this for my fifth graders. In fifth grade we learn all about energy and how the sun provides energy for all living things on Earth. My students were absolutely blown away that geothermal heat could be the source energy for living things as well. I showed this video in the last two weeks of school, and students created an energy pyramid to reflect the hydrothermal vent environment. My video had a very good educational ""extra feature"" with science demonstrations that explained concepts students needed to know to understand hydrothermal vent environments. Awesome, awesome enrichment tool. I will be looking for more videos from this producer. Please comment if you know any...",1246924800,5,689,5.106194690265487
2246374,4,B0007WFY5W,"This is a film whose strength lies mostly in its first-class imagery. The high definition underwater film coupled with the excellent CG sequences create a very unique and intimate look at life on the hydrothermal vents. If you are new to this ecosystem, you will be truly amazed and taken aback at how alien it is. But for those who are already somewhat familiar with  hydrothermal and chemosynthetic ecosystems, you won't be learning anything new. The film is fairly light on information, preferring to dazzle the viewer with closeup looks at the vents and impressive computer generated scenes.",1200960000,8,595,5.071428571428571
2246375,5,B0007WFY5W,"This... on HDTV... is just like in an IMAX!  I'm an earth science teacher, and I can tell you this mesmerized the class.  In fact, it's great for life science as well.",1175644800,9,167,4.1875
2246376,5,B0007WFY5W,I saw this feature at our local IMAX and as soon as it was released on DVD I had to have it!  Volcanoes of the Deep Sea features footage of some VERY cool invertebrates living DEEP under water at hot vents on the sea floor.  Ed Harris does a great job narrating.  I wish these IMAX features were longer!,1142380800,14,303,4.101694915254237
2246377,5,B0007WFY5W,"Given that they spend a lot of time at the lightless bottom of the ocean exploring ""black smoker"" geothermal vents, this was visually phenomenal. I heard somewhere that they used a new lighting system, and the color at depth was excellent - the teeming life they found down there was astonishing, and the mystery of the ""patterns in the sand cores"" was also quite interesting - possibly more so because the actual creatures responsible for the patterns had not, by the end of the movie, been located.

As a professional scientist in another field, I found this riveting - and so did my six-year-old. Can't say that about too many nonfiction films out there! One of the best features is that the film does go into detail, but mixes the narrative detail in with the stunning visuals in such a way that while older viewers are listening to the science as well as looking, the kids are looking at all the cool (well, hot, actually) stuff and may also be listening.",1132185600,37,960,4.614035087719298
2246378,5,B0007WFY5W,"First class adventure beneath the sea at depths and sea floors which are truly an ""other"" world.....but not.  Stunning visual wonders, facts and information about our current world and a wonderful adventure into the amazing world of our earth's past.  See it for yourself.  Words are pale imitations.",1124755200,17,300,5.208333333333333
2246396,4,B0007WFY5W,The photography is excellent. The reporting on these deep sea volcanoes is very useful or a general education science ourselves.,1379116800,,128,5.45
2246397,5,B0007WFY5W,My grandson is hooked on volcanoes and anybook or DVD is a winner. This movie is for all ages and shows a part of our changing planet we seldom see. Good product,1354838400,,161,4.0625
2246398,3,B0007WFY5W,It was good enough for what it was...isn't the best I've seen. I love blue planet videos shows more organisms.,1352332800,,110,4.55
2246399,5,B0007WFY5W,"In response to a review previously posted by a customer, this movie has everything to do with volcanoes. I was impressed with the cinematography and rigorous scientific studies that were compiled to make this film. The film is based in the mid Atlantic ocean ridge, where there are numerous active and inactive volcanoes. The film then shows the animals and bacterium that live and thrive in very harsh conditions such as: crushing pressure and very poisonous gasses venting from the volcanic sea floor.

I highly recommend this movie. Very educational and informative!",1301961600,3,569,5.184782608695652
2246400,2,B0007WFY5W,"I was disappointed with the content. I expected to see actual volcanoes, since that is what the title indicated. An example would be the volcano off the coast of Hawai'i that is building a new island on the sea floor. Other than that, it was OK for what it showed.",1298678400,,264,4.3
2246401,2,B0007WFY5W,"I saw this film at the IMAX in the Maryland Science Center, and while it is not the WORST big screen film I've ever seen, it's nowhere near being the BEST either.

Visuals: The underwater scenes are mostly dark\drab with only a few scenes of colorful tubes like you see on the cover. There was only ONE scene in the entire film that made me sit up and saw ""WOW!"" - and it wasn't the superflous CGI segments that added absolutely NOTHING to the film or the audience's understanding of the subject.

Narration: Dull, unininformative and lacking for several segments of the film. The music they played when the camera approached a heat vent was far too dramatic for the 2 or 3 seconds we'd get to see of it before the camera clouded up.

Script: Dull, unimaginative and obviously padded (and the film is only 47 minutes long!), but worst of all if it's unfocused: if it weren't for the occasional shot of a vent clouding up the camera it would be very easy to forget you were watching a film about volcanoes and not tube worms, fossilized sea creatures or any of the other topics this film covers in its relatively short run time.

2 stars (out of 5).",1294617600,,1148,4.42654028436019
2246402,5,B0007WFY5W,"I thought this was a very beautiful movie. You can't go wrong buying this one. The colors were incredible.
I know a filmmaker who creates IMAX films. The effort is unbelievable.

Volcanoes Under the Sea gives us a glimpse into our enormous ocean rift zones which circle the globe.
There are so many volcanoes that I don't know if anyone can count them. Then there exists the unbelievable
life surrounding the volcanic vents. What enchantment! I bet this deep sea life existed before we did (yes, you and me-dummy).

If you want to learn something new and perhaps enchant your children, buy this video.  I loved it!",1288396800,3,614,4.719626168224299
2246403,1,B0007WFY5W,"Often what is shown is not at all explained, other times only explained in a very cursory way. I was expecting much more information about the underwater vents than was presented. Also the narration did not always fit the imagery that was being shown at the moment. And the narration at times seemed rather lazily delivered and vague.
 The exact same shots were used more than once, not excusable for a feature that is only 45 minutes long.
Over-all this production seemed tacky and overly-impressed with itself, but failed to deliver at the same level as many other available documentaries of the natural world.",1287187200,5,612,4.884615384615385
2246404,1,B0007WFY5W,"We enjoy watching educational videos with our family and purchased this one for our library.  After watching it this evening we're very disappointed.

While the photo content was average, we soon discovered that a fair bit of it is computer generated imagery.... not fact but imagination.  There are periods of complete silence alternating with dramatic music, but very little clear explanation of the video photography being shown.  The writer/producer was very free to include far-fetched, contrived theories of origin presented as fact.

Neither was there a clear line of discovery or an educational theme.  This film was presented as scientific.  However, there was no presentation of what they hoped to discover, no explanation of the method they planned to use, no clear conclusion of the results found or how those results related to the original hypothesis.  The film was also presented as an educational video.  But there was no clearly stated overarching theme as would be expected... no ""if you remember nothing else, remember this"" idea.

Not even close to BBC.",1287100800,2,1073,5.222222222222222
2246405,4,B0007WFY5W,"I found this movie to be extremely unique, and facinating. It was very cool to see them filming 8000 plus feet below the ocean. Very rare footage, and I was amazed at the amount of life they found down there.

The only reason why I gave it 4 stars, is because they put a lot of ideas of how the earth spun off from a star, and a bunch of stuff they are guessing happened, as fact. It has a lot of the millions and millions and billions and billions of years ago evolutionary talk. I just looked past that though. I loved the rest of the movie, and if what I just mentioned doesn't bother you, then you will probably think it's 5 stars if you buy it.",1282867200,2,649,4.0310077519379846
