4690487,5,B005GHIK2M,I have been looking for this on DVD for a long time. Now I am not forced to have to watch it on Hulu anymore. This show was a great concept focusing on cameras that film us on a daily basis. This show followed the movie Look that was original broadcast prior and includes members from the movie as well. The case image I am afraid will chase many away as they see it as simply a voyeur/pornish movie which is a shame as there are elements in this show that do not focus on those aspects.,1405036800,4,487,4.030927835051546
4690488,5,B005GHIK2M,"Amazing look at how we live through the eyes of surveillance cameras, the security guards really make the movie more entertaining. Wish there were more seasons to this!",1352332800,3,168,5.035714285714286
4690489,1,B005GHIK2M,"I was  looking forward to this but was pretty diappointed... the characters are not very gripping, it doesn't follow any one person very closely such that you feel its about them and when the season ends it feels like there is no conclusions. I will be selling it :/ wasn't at all what I thought in terms of Camera perspective either. its more about other people watch folks in camera rather than you watching them. On the whole it left me unsatisfied.",1351123200,3,452,4.512195121951219
4690490,5,B005GHIK2M,"Whether it be for the graphic nature or the seediness, ""LOOK"" is as addicting as watching a train wreck, driving by accident scenes or watching a voyeur camera for hours, unable to pry yourself away just for the sheer sake that you know if you do, you'll miss something.

The concept is hidden cameras. They are everywhere, and the program treats you as if you were sitting in a booth that had access to all hidden cameras in the world and could follow the lives of multiple people seamlessly and effortlessly. It is a first person peeping Tom and as fun as it is, it is also equally disturbing at how, if you think about it, all of the cameras used to make the storylines come together are all completely pheasible and real. We are all, at all times, capable of being watched.

The show locks into 8 to 10 people and through hidden cameras tells their stories. At times, the camera shots are mundane and rudamentary, but that is part of the fun. It makes it real. The actors involved should all be commended for achieving a level of realness that sells the gimmick. Never once in the entire run of Season 1, did I think that these are actors, although I know they are because some are very familiar. Ali Corbin was just a big part of the new release of ""American Reunion"", for instance.

This is an outstanding show and when Season 1 concluded with a gasping moment, I scrambled to the internet to see if Season 2 was available. I hope it will be soon.",1343001600,8,1453,4.394052044609666
4690491,5,B005GHIK2M,"Adam Rifkin directed the movie LOOK and i rented it on a guess hopin it would be entertaining..and turns out i loved it. So when i heard Adam was directing the show LOOK for a T.V. series i was pumped,but it was on Showtime and i didn't have the station,So i missed it completely. Now it finally has hit dvd and i can tell you if you loved the film,the T.V series takes it a step further and basicly the movie LOOK part 2 spread out in to 25 min segments each week,and it's fantastic..It's about four or five differant story's going on and some connecting in odd ways. Tons of nudity,graphic segments,the show takes place from cameras no matter where the camera's are at,like the back of a car camera,street camera's security cameras in the mall,and others,Bottom Line buy this dvd..i really hope they make a season 2..This show is better than Breaking Bad,Walking Dead,American Horror Story...It's that good...",1324771200,16,911,4.7
8471567,4,B005GHIK2M,I'm a big fan of this show. I am pleased with the DVD however is there any way I can find this show in bluray? Also I would like to find season 2 of this show to purchase.,1521936000,,171,3.526315789473684

8471570,5,B005GHIK2M,"This is such a creative and entertaining series! It is all shot through surveillance cameras in every imaginable setting and webcams. It really makes you think just how many types of surveillance we can be under at any given point in the day. The series opens with a statistic that the average American is captured 200 times daily! I wish there was a second season but after such a long time, I doubt that it is ever coming to fruition, even though I read that it was in pre-production a few years ago. I highly recommend checking this show out, as well as the feature-length film LOOK.",1469318400,,586,4.485981308411215
8471571,5,B005GHIK2M,"I like Ali Cobrin. I came across her by chance in ""American Reunion."" After that I started looking into her body of work. ""Look"" is intoxicating, funny, and freaky. A bit of a walk on the wild side. Sharon Hannendael and the rest of the cast are also good. I recommend this show to Ali Cobrin fans.",1459123200,,298,4.245614035087719
