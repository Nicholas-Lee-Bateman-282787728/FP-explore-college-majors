8507158,5,B006ZPDMLS,"Victoria Vives and her troupe of kung fu fighting women has put together their first ten webisodes, and hopefully they'll reach a larger audience then they did with YouTube postings, and dozens of fans of women in combat in movies.

Sure, these are choreographed fights, not the ""real thing"", that falls under the arm of the law, and that I do not like watching when they finds their way from mobile phones/cameras to the net... Victoria's ""femmes"" are stage combat artists, and very good at it, and they have been imagining fight scenarios that cover at least ten of Hollywood's stereotypes. Although too brief for my taste, running from 3 to 9 minutes, each episode (well, webisode) has a little prop or twitch that shows imagination, humor, and love for their work. Sharp cinematography and straightforward stories, as required in the silent movie style of a hundred years ago, these episodes certainly are against the current trend of dark scenes to hide faulty acting and poor production values.

The production may be cheap, but it has nothing to hide - neither do the ladies, often in abbreviated dresses. The combat and dance moves are spectacular, and the moves are to be appreciated more than once. Some episodes I've seen more than four times already, and I'm thrilled yet again...

Amateur movie directors (and even many so-called professionals) would be wise if they bought and studied these webisodes, as lessons about how to make simple and efficient thrilling combat scenes. Provided that they have stunt people of this quality, that can act as well as fight.

8 webisodes are about woman-to-woman combat, and 2 are mixed combat scenes... (In this case, the male appears as a competent, able fighter as well, licked in the end by superior females, but this group also features mixed combat in which the ladies chew the bitter end of the fights.)",1441843200,,1861,4.898412698412699

8507160,2,B006ZPDMLS,"I ordered this based on the one review, which admitedly did not actually say anything about the show itself, only that he/she liked it and would buy any of them.  I had expected, at the very least, females in combat (from the picture on the cover) and hopefully in full contact (such as in MMA).  Unfortunately, this is simply a series of extremely short episodes in a longer, but disconnected, story.  The fighting is althletic, but choreographed, like the stupid so-called  ""professional wrestling"" ""shows.""  The writing, though stilted and cliche-ridden,  helped make it enjoyable and of course the (mostly) attractive women.  I wouldn't watch it twice.",1370044800,,656,5.132075471698113
