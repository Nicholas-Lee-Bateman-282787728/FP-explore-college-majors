2054058,5,B0002183ZQ,"Barney and the kids go through a scrapbook, remembering and reliving the good times they have had. Songs and short nursery rhymes/fairy tales are shown. This is relatively quick-paced, and holds my 2-year-old's attention well. Some of the songs included are: Mr. Sun, And the Green Grass Grew All Around, That's What An Island Is, Ta-Ra-Ra- Boom-De-Ay and, of course, I Love You. Ahh! That last one kills me. In all, there are 14 songs performed here.",1134259200,7,451,4.87012987012987
2054059,5,B0002183ZQ,"My mother got this for my 3 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it.  Basically, Barney goes through his scrapbook reminscising about some of fun times he's had.  Then they show older episodes of the show (my guess from the mid to late 90's).  If your kids like Barney, they will probably enjoy this DVD.

One proviso:  I gave it 5 stars because my daughter enjoys it, not because *I* enjoy it.  This is definitely not stuff for adults (well, not for the non-drooling segment of the adult population anyway.)  If you're over 7 years old this will definitely fry the rest of your functioning brain cells if you watch it too much.

As for bonus features, there are none, except for some trailers for upcoming children's DVDs like The Wiggles and Kipper.  It's kind of nice that they are in the bonus section so you don't have to watch them if you don't want to.

All in all, I recommend this for kids who are Barney fans.",1107820800,10,925,4.420118343195266

2054072,5,B0002183ZQ,It is amazing how my son is captivated by this DVD.  The songs and the way Barney sings them with his friends is absolutely brilliant.  The only time that my son sits still to have his meals is when we play this DVD for him.  A good buy if your child is a Barney Fan!,1227571200,,267,3.8181818181818183

2054075,5,B0002183ZQ,"My children are NOT into watching television (especially my 3yr old daughter) but this is one of the only shows besides Little Bill that they will literally sit and watch!  I love that they have learned so much from this dvd and yet are not tired of watching it.  My daughter was very shy but in viewing the children on the dvd, she has truly started to be more outgoing with other children.  I love the colors, the songs and how it is perfectly produced to grab the attention of a 1 year old and a 3 year old.  Great job, a true blessing in this household.",1204675200,,557,4.177570093457944

2054078,5,B0002183ZQ,"My son watches this DVD everyday and doesn't seem to tire of it.  He now adores Barney.  This is an older Barney episode but the songs brought back memories of when my girls, now teens, were toddlers and they loved those same songs too.",1163635200,,236,4.340909090909091
2054079,5,B0002183ZQ,"This particular DVD is great for my 15 month old.  If your child just likes to dance, sing or listen to music this is the one for you.  The special features offer a section called ""Jukebox"" where only the songs (along with the video)

will play. Since those children younger than two may have a difficult time following storylines or conceptualizing, parents can skip the actual video that combines Barney reminiscing with BJ and Baby Bop about the past with music and singing and go straight to music/singing without a delay between songs.  However, if you have a child who enjoys storylines, you can have that as well!  This video is great for kids 6 mos- to 7 years old!",1148601600,9,673,4.575

8019935,5,B0002183ZQ,"This collection is a compilation of memorable moments from previous shows, but the best thing about it is that there are 14 songs on the DVD and this is the chief attraction for the 2 year old for whom it was bought. The various montages are linked by a very credible storyline and it as usual continues the lessons on sharing and caring for others so it is a good addition to a pre schooler's DVD collection",1286064000,,408,4.311688311688312
8019936,1,B0002183ZQ,"***Parent Annoyance Meter Rating: 5*** (1= not annoying whatsoever, I would watch this without my child - 5=If I have to watch this again, someone better bring me a straitjacket)

This is one of those Barney videos that is not really a story on its own, but a series of flashbacks. I personally cannot stand this episode, and I have hidden it away so that my daughter will not ask to watch it. She however, doesn't seem to mind it, though it is not her favorite. I would recommend passing on this one and going for one of the Barney's that have higher production value like ""Let's Play School"", ""Let's Go To the Farm"", ""Let's Go To the Zoo"", ""Barney Songs from the Park"", ""Play it Safe"", or ""Moovin and Groovin"".",1258243200,2,712,4.435114503816794
