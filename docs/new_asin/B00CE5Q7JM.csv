8580747,5,B00CE5Q7JM,"This is a good music video collection of some of Missy Elliott's songs. Unfortunately, there aren't subtitle lyrics to sing along to so you'll have to know these songs.  Since it's a dvd you can insert it in a karaoke dvd player and sing along to it though you won't be able to disable the audio to make it instrumental.  Based on what I've read about her 'Hits of Miss E The Videos' dvd, I think this is a better collection of videos.",1366156800,2,435,4.228915662650603
