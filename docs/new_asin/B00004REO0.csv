If you'd like to watch the series I recommend buying the DVD set, but if you want to collect.. then this is a nice product/VHS Tape to be collected. The box art is really nice. It has a glossy look with vibrant colors. It stands out in between the rest of VHSs & DVDs/BlueRays.. etc ; ] [Get it brand new so it's got the plastic wrap to protect the cardboard case].
The price is very good, so if you collect VHS Tapes & you're a fan of this anime.. Stop thinking about it & get the damn thing XD
