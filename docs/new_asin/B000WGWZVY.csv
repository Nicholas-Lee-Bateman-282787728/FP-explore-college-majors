Not for financial gain, but to get these turtle back into the wild where they belong. These turtles have been around and not changed or addapted in any way ,since the time Dinosours romed the earth. They survived the ice age and were doing just fine for tens of thosand's of years... Heck Million's of years. Over the last 50 years Human's have destroyed this animals simple habatate,and has manage to wipe out 4/5ths of the wild turtle's. Over trapping these turtles for meat and as sad as this may sound Killed because of ignorant fisherman thinking the turtles wipe out game fish such as Large Mouth Bass or Trout. Witch is totally false as John point's out. These turtle are really not fishermen like the common snapping turtle. They prey on dieing fish and pretty much eat weaker animals in the pond or swamp that are going to die anyway. They play an important part in a water source's eco-system. John also points out that these turtles don't reach breeding maturity to around 18 years of age. We can help raise these little hatchlings at home and john will glady take them back when they get to big for your care,he will introduce these older turtles back into the wild,plus send you a new hatchling to raise free of charge. There is so much false info on these creatures. JOHN  seems to know more about these turtles than any Biologist or any Reptologist. Buy this DvD",1311379200,3,1535,4.602189781021898
8223295,4,B000WGWZVY,I was really hoping this would show more about the turtles than the turtleman.  It's not false advertising and the story is fascinating but it just came up a bit short.  I'm giving it a good review because it does what it claims not because it wasn't what I was looking for.,1233273600,,274,4.25
