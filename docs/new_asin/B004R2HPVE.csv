8438650,4,B004R2HPVE,"Movie opens on an intriguing mode that continues to be stronger as it progresses introducing the characters. They have a strong presentation that keeps the audience involved all the time until around intermission when suspense is completely unfolded. Looses the audience around the mid part for 10-15 minutes but the new character then keep them entertained. Songs are unnecessary but who can dare to make a hindi flick without songs. 1st song is really impressive. Rani Mukharajee keeps the tense situation, breezy. Satish Kaushik is unique. Shinde is incredible as usual. Certainly an entertainer.",1304035200,,599,5.382978723404255
