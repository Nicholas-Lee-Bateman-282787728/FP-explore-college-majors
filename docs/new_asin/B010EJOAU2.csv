8722253,5,B010EJOAU2,"Am pleased to report that Hinda and Shirley are as fully on their mark as ever, enthusiastic and articulate that the economy must serve people, not the other way around.  We met with them last night in Seattle and enjoyed viewing for our first time Two Raging Grannies.  Highly recommended, let this little film develop, engage and envelop you!  And be assured that in person Hinda and Shirley are every bit as nice, articulate and engaged as in the film.  Happy viewing!",1489968000,,471,4.7073170731707314
8722254,5,B010EJOAU2,"Compelling, entertaining , important. The fact is that these grannies are so far ahead of the curve it makes you wondrr why the masses do not get it. A must see doc.",1479513600,,165,4.1875
8722255,4,B010EJOAU2,"I originally tried to stream this film on Amazon when it first became available, but there was no sound and so I had to contact Amazon for a refund. Since then, it's not been available here, but IS available on Vimeo.

Apart for how contrived the unfolding narrative is (it's fairly obvious how situations and dialogue, while looking and sounding organic, were framed for storytelling impact),  I can still see a few applications for using this film in the classroom:

1. Some of the concepts are presented in ways that would be easier to access by my students
2. The inquiry process is nicely demonstrated whereby you have two learners in pursuit of a deeper understanding of an issue they care deeply about
3. It includes proactive ideas addressing unsustainable growth, like ecological economists pursuing a ""steady state system"" can be further pursued at all levels (local to global scope)
4. Also, it shows two brave and relentless souls actively engaged in problem-solving and citizenship.

There's just one part at around the 59-minute mark that's a potential deal-breaker for use in the classroom.  At the 60-minute mark, a man (whose face we don't see) physically threatens one of the ladies using shockingly vulgar language.",1454198400,2,1234,5.029411764705882
8722256,4,B010EJOAU2,the movie documented two elderly women's concern about the condition of our world and what we're leaving and what their grand childrene will be faced with.  And it was interesting watching try to get answers.... you decide,1448236800,,222,5.0
8722257,5,B010EJOAU2,Contains at least one shocking scene where an anonymous capitalist threatens one of the grannies with murder after they attempted to simply ask a question.  Unforgettable live documentary footage.  Asks the Big Question:  Why do we really need economic progress forever if it only leads to global destruction of the environment?  Two brave ladies!  Love 'em!!!!,1447459200,,361,5.375
8722258,1,B010EJOAU2,is most of the dialogue supposed to be muted? if so this movie is ridiculous.,1447113600,,77,4.2
8722259,5,B010EJOAU2,"Did you know that there are Raging Grannies chapters across America? Now you do, and two raging grannies from Seattle are the most endearing but dedicated political / social activists you'll ever meet. I really had no idea what to expect from the film, but the two friends do something amazing: they stump the economic experts by asking a simple question: ""Why must we always  have economic growth?""

The pursuit of the answer leads them across the country and their persistence in seeking an answer isn't always welcomed, but they make a huge impact. There's a shocking moment at the climax of the film that I won't spoil, but rest assured these grannies are anything but boring. Hugely recommended.",1442188800,,700,4.873949579831932
