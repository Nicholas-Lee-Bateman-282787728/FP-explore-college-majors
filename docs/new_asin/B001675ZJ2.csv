3153133,5,B001675ZJ2,"In Karl Malden's autobiography, he wrote that the series really started to click with season 2.  In season 1, they did the indoor scenes back in LA and the outdoor scenes in the city by the bay--they were always tired from all the flying!  In season 2, they did all the shooting in San Francisco.

One thing I like about season 2 is that the detective duo is getting more screen time.  In season 1, the show was such a showcase for the guest stars, that Stone and Keller actually seemed absent from much of the show.  There's better balance in season 2.  There are still more scenes with guest stars only than in a modern show, but we get to see a lot more of the great partnership then we did previously.

The stories are fairly routine for the 1970s, but this is just such a great looking show.  Malden and Douglas are great together, the acting is excellent, and the city looks fantastic.  The long tracking shots of two actors talking while walking through the streets of San Francisco with no cuts are a real hallmark of this series.",1215302400,16,1038,4.392670157068062

First they released it in two volumes for a total of $60.00 and now they released season 1 in one dvd set for just $53.00 so wait and not buy this season 2 vol 1 until they release the whole thing unless u can't wait at all...,1208563200,13,253,3.792452830188679
3153135,4,B001675ZJ2,"The 119 hour-long episodes of this police drama were originally broadcast on ABC from 1972 to 1977.  This DVD contains 12 episodes (570 minutes) of the 23 episodes from the second season.  All the second season episode titles and their original air-dates are detailed below.

Quinn Martin (""The Fugitive"" and ""The F.B.I."") stayed with his favorite genre and enhanced it by using the city made famous for its crime by ""Bullet"" and ""Dirty Harry"".  The production is classy but the stories are not particularly interesting or original.

The show's real claim to fame is as the best ever pairing of a veteran cop with a young hunk rookie.  While this is an overused concept it works particularly well in this series because the actors (Karl Malden as Mike Stone and Michael Douglas as Steve Keller) shared much the same career dynamic as their on-screen characters.  Veteran actor Malden (""On the Waterfront"" etc.) plays a blue-collar 23-year veteran of the force and acting novice Douglas a college-educated newcomer interested in new methods of crime solving.

3153136,5,B001675ZJ2,"I recently finished watching the entire first season of THE STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO and the episodes were even better than I remembered them.  Karl Malden and Michael Douglas work wonderfully together and every story has the mark of a high-quality production, with beautiful location scenery and top-notch guest stars.
As with HAWAII FIVE-O, the second season of STREETS isn't quite up to the level of the first year, but there are still quite a number of outstanding episodes.  Highlights include HAREM, where former teen idol Rick Nelson plays a boyish pimp who lures teenage girls into prostitution; A WRONGFUL DEATH, in which Inspector Keller is accused of shooting an unarmed youth; and BETRAYED, featuring Martin Sheen as an ambitious businessman who uses every tool he can think of -including robbery and murder- while climbing the ladder of success.
Looking ahead, the good news is that the best is yet to come: the third season of THE STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO is the finest year of all.  Meanwhile, don't pass up this latest collection of exciting police stories in The City By The Bay.  You won't be disappointed.",1206662400,26,1124,4.962765957446808
3153137,4,B001675ZJ2,"The Streets of San Francisco is part of the legacy of Quinn Martin, who was one of television's alltime most successful producers, responsible for some of television's most popular action/adventure series. Martin was the producer for such popular series as The Untouchables, The FBI, Cannon, and Barnaby Jones.

The Streets of San Francisco followed the pattern of most of Martin's shows. There were divided into three acts and an epilogue, and the guest stars were introduced at the beginning of each episode. The show feature veteran, Oscar-winning actor Karl Malden (who during this time starred in a series of popular commercials for American Express credit cards) and Michael Douglas, son of Hollywood legend Kirk Douglas.

Malden played veteran SF homicide cop Mike Stone, who was newly paired with rookie detective Steven Keller, played by Douglas. Following the Naked City model of police dramas, Stone showed the green Keller the ropes of policing the city while Keller used his criminology decree and understanding of modern technology to balance the equation. Darleen Carr has an occasional role as Stone daughter and Keller's eventual love interest.

This was a solid, enjoyable series and the teaming of Malden and Douglas was an excellent one. This show is one that is still entertaining almost forty years later.",1206662400,12,1327,5.25

3153165,5,B001675ZJ2,"""The Streets of San Francisco"" established itself in its first season on ABC and became even more popular in its second season, finishing 1973-74 ranked in the Top 30.  This DVD set contains the first eleven episodes from Season Two that were originally broadcast in the fall of 1973.

In these episodes of this superb crime drama, Lt. Mike Stone (Karl Malden) and his young, college-educated colleague Steve Keller (Michael Douglas) have great chemistry both in spite of and because of their age difference.  The two solve crimes such as murder, bank robbery, larceny, prostitution, organized crime, and a jail break.

The series was filmed on location in San Francisco, with great views of the city and surrounding bay and ocean framing the action, and the setting was further enhanced by incorporating period houses, bars, wharves, hospitals, and even the city zoo.  Alcatraz Island even made an appearance in an episode on this set.

Several notable guest stars including Michael Constantine, Martin Sheen, Leslie Nielsen, Tom Bosley, and Ricky Nelson appear on this set, and the Seventies cars and clothes here are cool.  Those who enjoyed Season One of ""Streets"" would enjoy these episodes as well.",1391299200,2,1204,5.112244897959184
3153166,5,B001675ZJ2,That is how Mike Stone would always refer to his partner inspector Keller. My brother and I used to watch this show religiously when it was out back in the 70's. My intentions are to have The first 4 seasons.,1353456000,,208,4.225

I got part of the first disk to play  on I Blu-Ray player ( I have 2 Blu-Ray players and 2 DVD players, all different brands) but it wouldnt play through and I thought it may have been because the disks were all scratched. I sent it back to Amazon who were nice to exchange it for this time, an unscratched copy.  However the new disks won 't play beyond showing the CBS logo because not one of the 4 disks in this volume will allow the menu to show. Very Frustrating, to say the least. Has anyone else experienced trouble with these disks? I have a DVD and Blu-Ray library of around 1500 in quantity and this is the only time I have ever experienced disks that won't even play the menu!!!

He often reminisced about how good those shows were compared with the police/crime TV series nowadays, so I decided to get him these sets. He absolutely loved them both and has been watching those episodes each night since he got them a couple of weeks ago. What a hit that Bithday gift was with him. Thank you, Amazon, for offering these at a great price and shipping them so quickly, just in time for his B-day.",1319760000,,603,4.252173913043478

The quality of these copies is excellent--the videos have been completely restored.  I would recommend this series to any fan of the old, gritty, 70's detective shows.  A real classic!",1306108800,2,439,4.64935064935065

Hawaii Five-o is also one of my favotite show, but the chemistry between Karl Malden & the younger looking Michael Douglas is what made me watch this show. Besides I live in the Bay Area now I wanted to see what San Francisco look like way back then",1275091200,,424,4.182926829268292
3153173,4,B001675ZJ2,"Great quality of scenery and acting when you consider this is made in 1973.
Michael Douglas is probably making his best acting scenes only overgone by Basic Instinct.
And Karl Malden also act very well and he's conviencing as a Leutennant. You forget that
the film crew are there. Probably the best police-series on television. Great scenery also.

I just wish that CBS DVD/ Paramount would stop ripping us off and release a full season set for these great shows.

How true, For my money this is one of the best series ever filmed. Kudos to Karl Malden one of the greatest actors ever. He totally owns this role and is unshakeable even after taking alot of verbal and physical abuse on the seies. What is interesting is that Maldens character can so easily connect with the city's working class characters. The city is populated with Runyonesque characters and great storylines. I heard that they were making another version of this show. I am not interested in seeing a bunch of rich yuppies and their problems. This show will forever be a classic",1219968000,7,700,4.608

3153179,5,B001675ZJ2,"The Streets of San Francisco is a true walk down memory lane, with none of the boring projector slides and dusty photos in a shoe box. Each episode in this volume is packed with thick plots, great acting, and a bit of humor. The chemistry between Mr. Malden and Mr. Douglas is secret ingredient that really what makes this whole series groove. That and the endless array of guest stars. In what other series could you see Tiny Tim, Tom Bosley, and Patty Duke?

If you are hungry for a good, old cop drama served up with a smear of nostalgia, this will not let you down.",1217548800,5,569,4.317757009345795
3153180,5,B001675ZJ2,It's great to see what San Francisco looked like nearly 40 years ago when Union Square had the old stores like Roos Atkins and the old San Francisco ride at Fisherman's wharf.  I miss seeing those from when I was a kid.  It's nice to take a trip down memory lane and see Karl Malden and Michael Douglas work together.  I just wish that they would release the entire season and not split it up.  It would be nice if there were some extras included too like they did in the first season volume one.,1216857600,12,496,4.189473684210526
3153181,3,B001675ZJ2,"You cannot fault the series itself, I love it and am so glad to be re-visiting ""Streets"".
I think I will have to reconsider buying anymore volumes due to the disgraceful tactis used by the studio to sell the dvds. I could not believe that Season TWO Volume ONE has only ELEVEN episodes. Why the volumes one and two when there are so few episodes in the season.
For goodness sake increase the price by 10.00 and sell it as a complete season.",1215907200,35,440,4.313253012048193

Those who enjoyed Season One of ""Streets"" would enjoy these episodes as well.",1391299200,2,1204,5.112244897959184

3387664,1,B001675ZJ2,"The first time I bought this from Amazon it wouldn't play.  I got part of the first disk to play  on I Blu-Ray player ( I have 2 Blu-Ray players and 2 DVD players, all different brands) but it wouldnt play through and I thought it may have been because the disks were all scratched. I sent it back to Amazon who were nice to exchange it for this time, an unscratched copy.  However the new disks won 't play beyond showing the CBS logo because not one of the 4 disks in this volume will allow the menu to show. Very Frustrating, to say the least. Has anyone else experienced trouble with these disks? I have a DVD and Blu-Ray library of around 1500 in quantity and this is the only time I have ever experienced disks that won't even play the menu!!! And that's each of the 4 disks!",1329004800,,781,4.158940397350993

3387666,5,B001675ZJ2,"I got these two sets of the Streets of San Francisco (Season 1, Vol. 1 and Season 2, Vol 1) as a birthday gift for my husband who first watched the series in his native Italy in the 1970's. He often reminisced about how good those shows were compared with the police/crime TV series nowadays, so I decided to get him these sets. He absolutely loved them both and has been watching those episodes each night since he got them a couple of weeks ago. What a hit that Bithday gift was with him. Thank you, Amazon, for offering these at a great price and shipping them so quickly, just in time for his B-day.",1319760000,,603,4.252173913043478
3387667,5,B001675ZJ2,"It's great seeing these old shows again.  My parents were from San Francisco, and I grew up there during the 60's and 70's.  So, this show helps me to remember the City the way that it was, rather that what it has become, which is almost unrecognizable.

The quality of these copies is excellent--the videos have been completely restored.  I would recommend this series to any fan of the old, gritty, 70's detective shows.  A real classic!",1306108800,2,439,4.64935064935065

shows.  I'm so thrilled.  I will be buying the entire six season series ASAP.

3387669,5,B001675ZJ2,"The video transfer of the 2nd season is quite good. Watching the 2nd season was fun - I thought it brought me back to my freshman year in college when the 1st season debuted. Hawaii Five-o is also one of my favotite show, but the chemistry between Karl Malden & the younger looking Michael Douglas is what made me watch this show. Besides I live in the Bay Area now I wanted to see what San Francisco look like way back then",1275091200,,424,4.182926829268292
3387670,4,B001675ZJ2,"Great quality of scenery and acting when you consider this is made in 1973.
Michael Douglas is probably making his best acting scenes only overgone by Basic Instinct.
And Karl Malden also act very well and he's conviencing as a Leutennant. You forget that
the film crew are there. Probably the best police-series on television. Great scenery also.

3387671,5,B001675ZJ2,"This is one of the best 70's cop shows ever. I just can't get enough of The Streets of San Francisco. Lots of action, car chases and good acting. Karl Malden and Mike Douglas have perfect chemistry and the scripts are top notch. Don't hesitate to buy this DVD. I just wish that CBS DVD/ Paramount would stop ripping us off and release a full season set for these great shows. Well, at least they did not replace the music in THIS show!",1232582400,3,435,4.253012048192771

3387673,5,B001675ZJ2,"One reviewer stated that if it weren't for the cars and clothes you wouldn't know that this was filmed 35 years ago. How true, For my money this is one of the best series ever filmed. Kudos to Karl Malden one of the greatest actors ever. He totally owns this role and is unshakeable even after taking alot of verbal and physical abuse on the seies. What is interesting is that Maldens character can so easily connect with the city's working class characters. The city is populated with Runyonesque characters and great storylines. I heard that they were making another version of this show. I am not interested in seeing a bunch of rich yuppies and their problems. This show will forever be a classic",1219968000,7,700,4.608
3387674,5,B001675ZJ2,"Ecellent remastering job on this series! If it wasn't for the classic cars and leisure suits, I would have thought it was shot in 2008!",1219104000,4,135,4.44

3387676,5,B001675ZJ2,"The Streets of San Francisco is a true walk down memory lane, with none of the boring projector slides and dusty photos in a shoe box. Each episode in this volume is packed with thick plots, great acting, and a bit of humor. The chemistry between Mr. Malden and Mr. Douglas is secret ingredient that really what makes this whole series groove. That and the endless array of guest stars. In what other series could you see Tiny Tim, Tom Bosley, and Patty Duke?

If you are hungry for a good, old cop drama served up with a smear of nostalgia, this will not let you down.",1217548800,5,569,4.317757009345795
3387677,5,B001675ZJ2,It's great to see what San Francisco looked like nearly 40 years ago when Union Square had the old stores like Roos Atkins and the old San Francisco ride at Fisherman's wharf.  I miss seeing those from when I was a kid.  It's nice to take a trip down memory lane and see Karl Malden and Michael Douglas work together.  I just wish that they would release the entire season and not split it up.  It would be nice if there were some extras included too like they did in the first season volume one.,1216857600,12,496,4.189473684210526
3387678,3,B001675ZJ2,"You cannot fault the series itself, I love it and am so glad to be re-visiting ""Streets"".
I think I will have to reconsider buying anymore volumes due to the disgraceful tactis used by the studio to sell the dvds. I could not believe that Season TWO Volume ONE has only ELEVEN episodes. Why the volumes one and two when there are so few episodes in the season.
For goodness sake increase the price by 10.00 and sell it as a complete season.",1215907200,35,440,4.313253012048193

MacMillan and Wife broke trail for the tough guy cop show but because it was set in S.F. MacMillan and Wife was a much softer kind of cop. Rock Hudson was amazing doing a lot of  his own stunts, and his acting was smooth and comfortable. He was a real pro. Michael Douglas is nostril flaring, cliche yelling overreacting cop. This kind of behavior is expected in New York but not in SF.",1496707200,,536,4.414141414141414
