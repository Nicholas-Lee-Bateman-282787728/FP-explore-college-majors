3147550,5,B0015VQAZM,"Most ""reality"" TV is scripted, or events are orchestrated by producers to maximize drama and improve ratings. Intervention is true reality television. It gets real, it gets dark, and it hits close to home. Everybody knows someone who struggles with addiction in one form or another. It's hard to watch and not feel real emotion for the families, and the addicts. This show definitely imitates life, whereas sometimes the addict finds recovery, and other times they don't. It really is satisfying at the end to see the one's who complete rehab, and to see how healthy and happy they look, and to listen for their plans, and bright outlook to their future. Of course it's never all milk and honey. If you are ever curious to know how your favorite Intervention addict is doing today, do a little research online, and you'll find a website that will update you about those who lost their battles with addiction.

This show also can be an eye opener on how you or someone else might be enabling an addict, and what steps need to happen for an addict to realize that they need help before it's too late.",1473638400,,1098,4.630769230769231

3147575,5,B0015VQAZM,I use this in a Life Management class for students to learn the serious effects of substance abuse and the value of intervention. Juniors and seniors can especially benefit by seeing how substance abuse that began in high school follows individuals into adult life to wreak disaster with careers and all social relationships.

3147580,3,B0015VQAZM,"There are more videos on the streaming video which doesn't tend to work well with Windows. I ordered it overnite air, and being in a major city hub, it got here right away.

DVd's still work much better than streaming and you get the extras you don't get otherwise.

As a show, I didn't get the shopper and the gambler. I didn't get his parents he conned for almost half a mil.

There were meth heads; no shooting up, thank God. I always thought that was a big negative in this show. Nasty. I've had the identical conversations with alkies they show here, so it was a sick sort of gallows laughter when you bang your head against walls trying to make addicts see logic. ""Where did you go last night?"" for example with someone you have every right to know where they are, such as a partner or child. ""Did you use?"" Well, yeah they used, they're freakin' addicts, that's what they do! Usually ALL they do, but still. Use caution, because they don't tend to be faithful when using.

I always love this show because it tends to have a happy ending. Wish they told more suffering people the truth about addiction, especially their families.

Main point: if you have a problem, you know it because of a pervasive unhappiness, no matter what. You're only happy stoned. You have innumerable relationship, financial and emotional drama in your life. People suggest ""Maybe you should quit,"" or tell you outright you have a problem. Normal people don't ever hear things like this-they don't have to. They can take it or leave it to start.

Yes, real life will still suck butt some days, BUT you will be able to handle it sober; a thing which you can't put a price on or underestimate how great it can be. It will be hard for a time, the first year is hardest, but it gets much easier after the first 12 months of roller-coaster stuff. When you make your life about helping others, you will finally find what you wasted your life and money and everything looking for: real happiness. It won't hurt forever. The feelings you blocked for years will hurt coming out. But they can't kill you. It just feels like it sometimes. :)It will pass, as everything does.

Try the A's if you need them. The Anonymous groups: AA, NA, CA, whatever A you need. Give it a full commitment for a full year, and see how you feel. It takes that long to notice a difference most of the time. It takes that long for your brains to start to heal, though once you've been a pickle, you never get to be a cucumber again. Read Alcoholics Anonymous, especially the stories in the back. It's an easy read and given a lot of comfort to people for many decades.

parents/lovers/children/spouses: Try Al-anon. Give it a full year of a commitment. It will help you immeasurably, even if they're dead and have been for decades; the pain doesn't stop. Especially if they're sober, you need help to move forward. If they're not, you need to be with others who get it, that you don't have to explain yourself to. You will get strength you don't know you have.

It takes that long to see a real steady difference, just as it does for the addict/alkie. After that, I guarantee you that you won't want to go back to how it was. Live YOUR life, not the addict's.

Go to bed. Don't wait up for them. Make plans for things you have always wanted to do. Let them have their consequences. If you told them you'd leave if they vanished overnight, AGAIN, then DO that. You have to; they had fair warning. Keep putting THEIR problem out of YOUR mind, and back in their laps. Over, and over and over and over and over again. Think about and DO stuff that makes YOU happy. Ignore them when they say mean things and act insane. imagine they're yelling it out the window of a mental hospital, and know that like bad pennies, addicts ALWAYS turn up, sooner or later, looking for money or a place to crash, if nothing else. Don't give them money or lend them your car. You'd be liable if they hurt someone with it.

  Addicts have guilt about pain they cause; when they bait you into being furious, they win. It makes YOU look crazy, so they HAVE to use, because you're so awful. You MADE them an addict. If so, then they NEVER have to quit. Rule 1: protect the addict inside at ANY cost. Don't cry. Just walk out of the room or the house. Buy those Bose noise cancelling headphones. I think was the best 299.00 I ever spent. They can rant all they like, and you can not hear them. It's like freakin' Utopia. lock the bathroom door, go sit in the garage, do what you gotta do. Tell them they're not acting logical, and leave. Let them know you love them and you'll be back when you feel safe around them. Or they can come back sober.

Don't give them ANY money, DO NOT bail them out of jail. Again. If your house rules are no alcohol in your house, and they break it, tell them what you will do in advance and stick to it. If they are violent, rude, mean or abusive, you have the right to protect yourself. Leave if you have to. Call the cops if you know they'll rip you off and ask the cop to get them to leave. File any charges for forgery, theft, abuse. If it's domestic, don't expect to have a win in court: domestics are a joke, btw. BUT you just keep having them arrested. Keep signing those papers. Eventually they will figure out they don't care for lockup.

If you love an addict, why do you settle for crumbs of a relationship? You are worth better. The addict has you, but what do YOU have in return? Don't mother them anymore. Let them have their own consequences like the rest of us.

Addicts USE not only substances, but people. Don't be stunned to find numerous lies, cons, other relationships, thefts, forgery, total unreliability, and extreme anger if you dare to ruin their high. Go to yourself, ""Yeah, whatever."" A lot. We get the right to ruin our life if we want to.

Don't lay your whole life on some magical treatment cure. it's expensive, and lots of addicts won't do it if they can go back to using. AA's at least free, and that's what keeps people sober long-term. Live your own life, don't lay your life on if they're good or not.

This is just what helped me, what I did that gave me peace from both sides of the fence. You still get to and have to make your own decisions. These are merely suggestions, as is everything in 12 step programs. Addiction is the scourge of society, and drunks are often seen as normal drinkers from outside the household. This hurts, of course, to be told someone didn't die of liver disease, but some imaginary cause. When the family or friend wasn't even there much of the time.

Don't drink or use any substance to get a break from their issue. Get out of the house, get a massage or a manicure, do something YOU love. Something that never fails to make you happy. Volunteer at an animal shelter and sniff the fresh puppies.

As for the damned phone, disconnect it if you're getting 3am calls. If someone's dead or hospitalized, they will still be so tomorrow. I've been known to toss the phone in the closet. I once ripped the doorbell I always hated the sound of right off the wall, b/c the addict wouldn't stop ringing it for 2 hours. That's normal with an addict.

Respectfully hoping this helps someone who needs it. The show is sort of like being with the addict, but a better outcome, and I have hope for them, more than I ever got dealing with addicts in ""real life."" Mine usually die, but that's their right.",1368835200,,7411,4.375272727272727

3382077,3,B0015VQAZM,"There are more videos on the streaming video which doesn't tend to work well with Windows. I ordered it overnite air, and being in a major city hub, it got here right away.

DVd's still work much better than streaming and you get the extras you don't get otherwise.

As a show, I didn't get the shopper and the gambler. I didn't get his parents he conned for almost half a mil.

There were meth heads; no shooting up, thank God. I always thought that was a big negative in this show. Nasty. I've had the identical conversations with alkies they show here, so it was a sick sort of gallows laughter when you bang your head against walls trying to make addicts see logic. ""Where did you go last night?"" for example with someone you have every right to know where they are, such as a partner or child. ""Did you use?"" Well, yeah they used, they're freakin' addicts, that's what they do! Usually ALL they do, but still. Use caution, because they don't tend to be faithful when using.

I always love this show because it tends to have a happy ending. Wish they told more suffering people the truth about addiction, especially their families.

Main point: if you have a problem, you know it because of a pervasive unhappiness, no matter what. You're only happy stoned. You have innumerable relationship, financial and emotional drama in your life. People suggest ""Maybe you should quit,"" or tell you outright you have a problem. Normal people don't ever hear things like this-they don't have to. They can take it or leave it to start.

Yes, real life will still suck butt some days, BUT you will be able to handle it sober; a thing which you can't put a price on or underestimate how great it can be. It will be hard for a time, the first year is hardest, but it gets much easier after the first 12 months of roller-coaster stuff. When you make your life about helping others, you will finally find what you wasted your life and money and everything looking for: real happiness. It won't hurt forever. The feelings you blocked for years will hurt coming out. But they can't kill you. It just feels like it sometimes. :)It will pass, as everything does.

Try the A's if you need them. The Anonymous groups: AA, NA, CA, whatever A you need. Give it a full commitment for a full year, and see how you feel. It takes that long to notice a difference most of the time. It takes that long for your brains to start to heal, though once you've been a pickle, you never get to be a cucumber again. Read Alcoholics Anonymous, especially the stories in the back. It's an easy read and given a lot of comfort to people for many decades.

parents/lovers/children/spouses: Try Al-anon. Give it a full year of a commitment. It will help you immeasurably, even if they're dead and have been for decades; the pain doesn't stop. Especially if they're sober, you need help to move forward. If they're not, you need to be with others who get it, that you don't have to explain yourself to. You will get strength you don't know you have.

It takes that long to see a real steady difference, just as it does for the addict/alkie. After that, I guarantee you that you won't want to go back to how it was. Live YOUR life, not the addict's.

Go to bed. Don't wait up for them. Make plans for things you have always wanted to do. Let them have their consequences. If you told them you'd leave if they vanished overnight, AGAIN, then DO that. You have to; they had fair warning. Keep putting THEIR problem out of YOUR mind, and back in their laps. Over, and over and over and over and over again. Think about and DO stuff that makes YOU happy. Ignore them when they say mean things and act insane. imagine they're yelling it out the window of a mental hospital, and know that like bad pennies, addicts ALWAYS turn up, sooner or later, looking for money or a place to crash, if nothing else. Don't give them money or lend them your car. You'd be liable if they hurt someone with it.

  Addicts have guilt about pain they cause; when they bait you into being furious, they win. It makes YOU look crazy, so they HAVE to use, because you're so awful. You MADE them an addict. If so, then they NEVER have to quit. Rule 1: protect the addict inside at ANY cost. Don't cry. Just walk out of the room or the house. Buy those Bose noise cancelling headphones. I think was the best 299.00 I ever spent. They can rant all they like, and you can not hear them. It's like freakin' Utopia. lock the bathroom door, go sit in the garage, do what you gotta do. Tell them they're not acting logical, and leave. Let them know you love them and you'll be back when you feel safe around them. Or they can come back sober.

Don't give them ANY money, DO NOT bail them out of jail. Again. If your house rules are no alcohol in your house, and they break it, tell them what you will do in advance and stick to it. If they are violent, rude, mean or abusive, you have the right to protect yourself. Leave if you have to. Call the cops if you know they'll rip you off and ask the cop to get them to leave. File any charges for forgery, theft, abuse. If it's domestic, don't expect to have a win in court: domestics are a joke, btw. BUT you just keep having them arrested. Keep signing those papers. Eventually they will figure out they don't care for lockup.

If you love an addict, why do you settle for crumbs of a relationship? You are worth better. The addict has you, but what do YOU have in return? Don't mother them anymore. Let them have their own consequences like the rest of us.

Addicts USE not only substances, but people. Don't be stunned to find numerous lies, cons, other relationships, thefts, forgery, total unreliability, and extreme anger if you dare to ruin their high. Go to yourself, ""Yeah, whatever."" A lot. We get the right to ruin our life if we want to.

Don't lay your whole life on some magical treatment cure. it's expensive, and lots of addicts won't do it if they can go back to using. AA's at least free, and that's what keeps people sober long-term. Live your own life, don't lay your life on if they're good or not.

This is just what helped me, what I did that gave me peace from both sides of the fence. You still get to and have to make your own decisions. These are merely suggestions, as is everything in 12 step programs. Addiction is the scourge of society, and drunks are often seen as normal drinkers from outside the household. This hurts, of course, to be told someone didn't die of liver disease, but some imaginary cause. When the family or friend wasn't even there much of the time.

Don't drink or use any substance to get a break from their issue. Get out of the house, get a massage or a manicure, do something YOU love. Something that never fails to make you happy. Volunteer at an animal shelter and sniff the fresh puppies.

As for the damned phone, disconnect it if you're getting 3am calls. If someone's dead or hospitalized, they will still be so tomorrow. I've been known to toss the phone in the closet. I once ripped the doorbell I always hated the sound of right off the wall, b/c the addict wouldn't stop ringing it for 2 hours. That's normal with an addict.

Respectfully hoping this helps someone who needs it. The show is sort of like being with the addict, but a better outcome, and I have hope for them, more than I ever got dealing with addicts in ""real life."" Mine usually die, but that's their right.",1368835200,,7411,4.375272727272727

Could you please put all the episodes and seasons together into one dvd set of this wonderful series?

The problem is the dvds are burned and not pressed. The dvds with dyes will deteriorate faster than pressed ones. The information presented in this series is worthy of, and should prove itself profitable enough to package it as a complete set of all episodes in that format.
