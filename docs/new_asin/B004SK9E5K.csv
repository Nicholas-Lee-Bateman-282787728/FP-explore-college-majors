8439837,3,B004SK9E5K,"I bought this for a 2 year old who's obsessed with bowling. It's kind of neat to see the old ""stars"" bowling, but I wouldn't call it laugh-out-loud funny. My son enjoys it, and that's all that matters.",1462406400,,201,4.315789473684211
8439838,3,B004SK9E5K,"Have you ever found yourself sitting around on the sofa on a Saturday thinking, ""I wish I could see Gabe Kaplan and Norm Crosby bowl against Pat Harrington and Shelley Berman to win a Westclox, Electrophonic stereo system with LP and 8-track players, King Koil mattress set, or maybe even a La-Z-Boy?"" If so, boy have I got a show for you: Celebrity Bowling! Long before Dancing with the Stars proved that it didn't need stars, Celebrity Bowling proved that it didn't need celebrities. Actually, that's too harsh: There are some genuine celebrities who pop up in this series, and even those you may not recognize now were usually at least somewhat well known in the 1970s, when this show was produced. Many of them come from television and are part of that constellation of B-list 1970s celebrities who would pop up on daytime soap operas, game shows like Celebrity Bowling, and guest-starring roles on the Love Boat.  It is often a stretch, though, to describe the contestants as ""Hollywood's biggest stars,"" as they always are introduced at the start of the show.

So, why would anyone watch this show? I do wonder what the appeal was when the shows originally aired, but as a time capsule or nostalgic trip down memory's bowling lane, this series can be fun to watch today. First, the celebrities dress casually, and the men's clothes are often hideous as they could be only in the 1970s: Polyester pants matched with polyester shirts with wild prints or cotton shirts with broad stripes and huge collars, often topped off with gold necklaces. These bowlers may be stars, but if they were holding clear plastic cups of Budweiser, they'd look like average Joes in a small-town 1970s bowling league tournament. That's part of the charm of the series--even the biggest stars who appear on the program, like Ed Asner and William Shatner, look resolutely unglamorous. As for the women, who appear less often on the program, their dress is often more variable, from little girl ponytails and dresses to some less dated and less Lolita-like looks.

If you want to step into a time machine and dial into in the 1970s, then settle in and watch to an episode or two of this series. The series may not be an entertainment strike or even a spare, but it's not a gutter ball either.",1425945600,2,2272,4.732323232323233
8439839,5,B004SK9E5K,I liked it because the person I got it for loves watching bowling.  Actually recognized some of the celebrities in it.,1392249600,,118,4.619047619047619
8439840,4,B004SK9E5K,"""Celebrity Bowling"" is a very interesting, enjoyable show! I hope this show will be made available in season sets pretty soon!

Let me get the gripes I have about the set out of the way:
  That dumb new logo they put at the end of every episode. Why didn't they just put it with the others when you put in the disc and when it ends? I wonder, since the show was done at Metromedia, if they originally ended with that MPC logo?
  I wish they would've included info with episode numbers and years. All you can tell is that some of them were made in 1976, and others were not. They were obviously not in chronological order. The only episodes on this set that would be considered ""milestones"" are the 100th episode, and one where a team broke the record for lowest score. But it doesn't have the first or last episodes, or definitely not that 90-min. special.
  Companies that put together these sets usually figure that people have read about or seen such-and-such online, so they put that episode on the set. The ""Match Game"" set includes the ""school riot episode"" for that reason, I believe. Unfortunately, don't expect to see that Tom Kennedy & Richard Deacon Vs. Ed Ames & McLean Stevenson episode here.

What I like about it:
  Of course, that it was put together at all! I like the fact that some company is putting together a DVD set of yet another interesting, obscure show!
  Again, at least they DID include a couple of ""milestone"" episodes.
  There was one episode that included commercials for Colgate-Palmolive involving a free bowling promotion. This may be annoying to some folks, but I think it's neat that the long blank space in the tape between one of those commercials and the next part of the show is kept in!

  I think it's great when DVD sets of obscure shows come out (such as ""Pink Lady & Jeff"" or ""The Magic Garden"")! I'll be looking for ""Roller Derby"" and ""Bowling for Dollars"" in the hopefully-near future. But until then, I guess I'll settle for season sets of ""Celebrity Bowling"".",1315008000,3,2009,4.5515320334261835
8439841,5,B004SK9E5K,I love these shows!  It's great to see how celebs behave when there are no scripts!  The original reality TV!  Keep 'em coming!,1307404800,4,127,4.434782608695652
8439842,5,B004SK9E5K,Pop in a disc and flash back to a time when ascots and polyester pants were actually considered cool. Watching these celebs bowl for a washing machine or aome other household appliance is priceless. So glad these episodes are collected in this 3 DVD set. Thank you S'more Entertainment,1306454400,6,285,4.836734693877551
8439843,4,B004SK9E5K,I watched these on ESPN Classic earlier this year and it was so much fun.  So many memories and what fun to see the true stars as everyday people having a good time bowling and cracking each other up.  Just great to watch.,1306108800,5,222,4.1395348837209305
8439844,5,B004SK9E5K,"Several classic episodes of television at its finest!
