Here the english voices are not re-dubbed ( they re-dubbed the voices of majin buu in the orange brick version which is cropped, etc), and the disc offers the original japanese cast.",1392940800,,254,4.3125

The one thing the Champ can do is pull off a snow job. So convincing the world to accept him may be easier than they Z fighters first believed.",1355875200,,292,4.051724137931035

Like one of the guys before me said, ""You are too absolutely avoid the English version as it takes away from all the emotion of the Japanese version."" Wrong. The original isn't always better...
The Japanese version has girls do the voices. And when I say girls, I am not joking. The voice of Goku in Japanese is done by an actual girl. It sounds like a girl, and its not very good for gokus character. Anyways, the Japanese version has bad music. Basically there is never any music too fit the mood. The sound quality is also less than average. Besides, When Goku finally powers up in the English version and gets ready to fire his bomb, an intense, moving music kicks in and lets you feel the atmosphere because you know the bomb is going to completely obliterate anything in it's path. In the Japanese version, there is no music(literally). Lets be honest though, the original isn't always better. Some people just won't stop whining about how the Japanese version is the only way to watch. Heres a tip, get a life... The English version on this DVD is way better, and who cares if it isn't the first version made like 30 years ago.",1068940800,2,1258,4.45021645021645
7962089,5,B00006677B,"These episodes detail the final destruction of Majin Buu.  However there is still the potential for good Buu to release the angry side once more.  In a pinch the champion finally convinces the humans to give their spirit energy to Goku's spirit bomb.  Still, Goku lost most of his strength trying to power up the SS3 form to its maximum and so the eternal dragon porunga may have to step in and give him back that strength he needs to get Buu inside the bomb.  Look for tons of guest spots from original Dragon Ball characters on this disc.  6 months after Evil Buus death the Good Buu has been wiped from the easily frightened people's minds(again by the dragonballs) however he may not be able to cope with everyday social etiquette problems much less Bulma ordering him around.  Mr. satan's guidance is the only thing keeping Majin Buu from killing, kinda frightening thought there.",1043625600,6,885,4.67741935483871
