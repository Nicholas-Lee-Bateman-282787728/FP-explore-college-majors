4285633,4,B00480OCXO,"Since they are never going to release the best All New Scooby Doo Movies of which one of the best of the ""Guest Stars"" were the Addams Family, we have thankfully the same HB guest stars in their own cartoon series!! This is the same cast that would appear in the aformentioned ANSDM. These characters are IMHO the closest to the Charles Addams comics strip characters, because they are just that, animated comic strips. The big bonus for me is instead of the Haunted Mansion in the TV series, we are treated to the ""Creepy Camper"" which is the RV version of their home! I think they are the best voices for what you would imagine the Addams Family characters to sound like. The episodes are hilarious, I really laugh out loud when Morticia does her screams (song for her) and Grandmama is priceless, the voices and the animation are tooo funny. They are all here, Lurch, Thing, Fester, Pugsley, Wednesday, Morticia, Grandmama, Gomez, even Cousin Itt, and some extra added cooky characters, such as Ocho an Octopus, Mr. V a vulture, and an assortment of other weird pets, including Morticias carnivorous plant.",1363219200,4,1109,4.751295336787565

4285638,5,B00480OCXO,"I just got this dvd in the mail today and the first thing i did when i took it out of the package was insert the dvd into the dvd player and it worked fine! so to answer the question that i was wondering about as well as a few of you out there, ""what the hell do they mean by playback play now dvd player?"" to put it in plain english, these dvds play just fine in your regular dvd player! these sets are just like an official bootleg only with very nice artwork. and one-sided discs. the appearance is just fine, and you don't have to see any annoying ""b"" boomerang or whatever other tv station logo or popup or damn commercials. very well packaged, well done. though, not digitally remastered, i don't give a hoot, i'm just glad to have them! now they need to do the 1980's jonny quest and i HOPE someone will do the rest of the depatie/freleng cartoons (super president!!! the barkley's, oddball couple), and hanna barbera needs to come out with that second and final season of ""wait til your father gets home"" HURRY UP!!!! customer with money for dvds here saying to you companies, RELEASE THE DAMN THING ALREADY!!! and do i have to get into a rant about BATMAN 1966 tv series and the filmations 1968 one????????????????????",1308096000,13,1227,4.409691629955947

4285640,1,B00480OCXO,"There isn't anything indicating this, but this is the cartoon from the 60s not the 90s. The voices are very classic cartoon and plots are also pretty classic. I was disappointed, but I guess that's on me.",1497830400,,204,4.54054054054054

4285642,3,B00480OCXO,"It's an entertaining show. Personally, I prefer the live action series or the 90's animated version. This just isn't as...macabre. It's still The Addams Family, but you get a bit less of their typical morbidity. It's slightly Scooby-Doo like, in my opinion.
The sound is a bit off on the intro for a few episodes and there's some slight pause (almost like the disc skipped) at least once. But, converting an old show to DVD, that can be expected.",1483315200,,446,4.658227848101266

4285661,3,B00480OCXO,"Just another ripped copy of the original animated series, with no mastering, extras, etc. Find it to stream before you even consider buying (and, yes, it IS out there, if you wish to um ... search, wink wink). Being a kid from the 70s, I have a personal fondness for THIS Addams Family (not the Charles Addams editorials, the classic b/w TV show, the later cartoons, or movies). Like all incarnations, though, the humor is pretty much black puns, so nothing new to write home about. However, it's somewhat creative (the house is a ""motorhome"" on wheels here) and fun. So, worth a look.",1407628800,2,585,4.634615384615385
4285662,5,B00480OCXO,I love the Addams family so I decided to give the animated version a try. When I was watching it I realized that the person who plays uncle Fester in the live TV series is the voice for uncle Fester for the animated version. There are differences though. So in some ways it goes about the family differently than what most people think when they think of the Addams Family. I would recommend this DVD in a heart beat!,1401926400,6,417,4.291139240506329
4285663,3,B00480OCXO,"Cartoon was great,BUT GOT A BAD COPY,FROM (STANDING OVATION) they took by money,and would not change it. Outside of that the cartoon was great. I watched it when I was a kid.",1401148800,,174,4.46875

4285665,3,B00480OCXO,"I didn't grow up watching this cartoon, but always watched the black and white show, and the movies. This is a little disappointing because its not really on the morbid gothic side like the show or the movies, but more funny and happy going. (which I should of assumed since it's a cartoon}",1396137600,,290,4.490566037735849

4285668,5,B00480OCXO,"This version of the Addams Family seems more in tune with the original Charles Addams comic strip while still including some of the best Addams Family TV Show qualities.  Gomez Addams is short and pudgy a shocking change from the thin athletic John Astin Gomez who in my opinion defined the role.  However all the Addams in the animated version are just as funny and all together creepy as those on the 1960's Addams Family TV show.  the Addams Family animation quality id typical Hanna Barbara fare maybe a step down from Flintstones Quality.  The animators did manage to capture the essential essences of the Addams characters.  Best of all the comedy works between the Characters.  Only thing missing is Gomez is not made to seem as passionately in love with Morticia Addams as was the case on the Addams Family TV show.  I understand this animated version of the Addams Family was designed for Saturday Morning Kiddy time viewing but, I always felt the love shared between Gomez and Morticia was ALWAYS handled in the best taste.  Gomez was always passionately in love with Morticia but never showed it in ways patently vulgar.  I was an autistic very young child when the Addams Family TV show first aired and I was pleased to see a husband and wife love each other so passionately and honestly.

I always enjoyed these Addams Family animated stories and remember waiting to watch them on Saturday Mornings.  Because Uncle Fester loved light bulbs as did I he was always special to me.",1385337600,14,1490,4.736434108527132

8418475,1,B00480OCXO,"I grew up watching the original 60s television show , but , didn't remember THIS cartoon. My daughter , really loves the old series , so , I thought she might enjoy this one , since it features Ted Cassidy ( ""Lurch"" ) and Jackie Coogan ( ""Uncle Fester"" ) , voicing their original characterizations. How wrong I was! I sat through all 16 episodes with her , and they are dreadfully lacking the Addams Family charms.( Of both Charles Addams original creations , and the t.v.show. ). A lot of the plots come off as ""Scooby-doo"" throw aways. The Addams Family are now relegated to driving across the country in their ""Creepy Camper"" ( a poor man's ""Creepy Coupe"" from the ""Wacky Races"". ) , as opposed to everybody coming to their home. The animation is sub-par , even by 1970s animation standards! Lots of ink and paint mis-coloring. Lots of errors in character composition. ( Sometimes Gomez and Lurch are the same height! ). Sometimes Uncle Fester has ears , other times he doesn't. But  probably most grating and annoying of all , is Lennie Weinrib's voicing of Gomez! ( He's basically imitating Johnny Carson's ""Art Fern"" character , and it is the epitome of bad voice casting! ). I should also point out , the picture quality - as far as transfers go -  is pretty good , even if the occasional second or two seems to be suffering from poorly stored master tapes. The sound quality , volume wise , seems to differ from episode to episode. Overall , I would only recommend this to the hardest of hardcore Addams Family collectors!",1514592000,,1530,4.5398550724637685
8418476,1,B00480OCXO,"These are very cheap dvd-r's and look pretty terrible honestly. No care was put into thisand you can tell. If you are expecting the same quality of other hanna barbera sets like Scooby doo and Yogi Bear, forget it. These are not what you want.
