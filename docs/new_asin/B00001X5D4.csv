7914961,5,B00001X5D4,"This is a Mexican Wrestling film circa 1990's that pays homage to the old Mexican Wrestling films that were produced in Mexico during the 1950's-1970's. Mexican Wrestling films were a particular genre where Mexican wrestlers were your local super hero without the super powers. They used wrestling moves and their wits to stop the bad guys and bring them to justice. This film is very pulp, and follows the cult classics of El Santo, Blue Diamond etc. There is some fast wrestling action and a positive message for kids. Overall it is a fun film, cheesy but fun.",1450656000,,562,4.744897959183674
7914962,3,B00001X5D4,"Ok so this movie is painfully stupid, but that makes it funny, the characters and acting are terrible the props are from the early 90's. This is about a boy who persuades a oversensitive bitch of a failing wrestler to defend his family from a construction company trying to build a highway where their neighborhood is. i cant really compare this to anything else because i haven't seen anything this stupid. just buy it and laugh its only 7 dollars and one hour of your life.",1237334400,,475,4.534883720930233
7914963,1,B00001X5D4,"I can't believe I bought this piece of...  I'm looking for a fork right now so I can gouge my eyes out.  If the director makes a sequel as he says, I'll hunt him down.  If this is ""mexican justice"" I'll never party in TJ again.  Jeez.",1071792000,,234,3.9148936170212765
7914964,1,B00001X5D4,This an extremely horrible- I don't know what to call it. I can only believe that the other reviews were friends of the director. Don't waste your time or money.,1022716800,,161,4.4
7914965,5,B00001X5D4,Atomic Blue destined to become a classic wrestling movie. Atomic Blue utilized many of the United Wrestling Council's stars and that is a very big reason that the movie's wrestling action is incredible! The other  reason is our UWC wrestlers were able to overcome the ineptness of the so  called legendary wrestling mark and mark co-ordinator Karl Lauer's  participation in the making and the all out exploitation of mexican  wrestlers! We salute Mr. Salazar and the many people that it took to make  and believed in the work and the message the movie makes.,964396800,2,558,4.8936170212765955
7914966,5,B00001X5D4,"First of all it was about time that a movie produced by Latinos of this high quality was made. I remember watching the wrestler movies with El Santo and Blue Demon and the excitment it caused with all those other kids  watching. This brings back all those same feelings while thinking that it  is being produced by today by these two entrepreneurs who obviously were  exposed to this type of entertainement. Congratulations, and go Latino  Power!",949622400,,446,4.828947368421052
7914967,5,B00001X5D4,"Azul Atomico is the best kept secret in wrestling movies.  The story is one for the whole family, the soundtrack is awesome, the Culture Clash guys are hilarious, and it's a great film altogether!  This makes a great gift  for anyone who likes wrestling and Lucha Libre!",948067200,3,270,4.702127659574468
7914968,5,B00001X5D4,"Atomic Blue Mexican wrestler is a fantastic film. It combines action, comedy, drama and politics. I thought the film was quite entertaining. For an independent film it has a very high production value. The actors in the  film were great especially Azul, Hirsch and Nick. The wrestling scenes are  realistic and well done. Culture Clash is hilarious. The video sends a  serious message  and does very interesting political satire. Azul's  populist appeal reminds me of Super Bario a famous Mexican wresler. The  soundtrack is also quite good. All in all this video is a interesting and  entertaining film that I would highly reccommend!",947116800,4,635,5.106796116504855
7914969,5,B00001X5D4,"Azul Atomico (Atomic Blue)...brings back memories of childhood backyard wrestling tournaments inspired by Lucha Libre. In the mythical world of Lucha Libre (Mexican Wrestling), the man behind the mask was a  manifestation of all that was possible in the world. The 60's and 70's may  have brought some psychedelic trips to American hippies, but in Mexico,  that era brought Lucha Libre. Every kid wanted to be like wrestling  superstars like El Santo (The Saint) and Mil Mascaras (A Thousand Masks).  They were the epitome of what a gentleman should be, never resorting to  guns and always respectful. In a country filled with corrupt politicians,  masked wrestlers in tights darting across the ring became the  revolutionaries of Mexican Cinema. And like Lucha Libre movies of  yesteryear, Azul Atomico has a mission and a lesson.
It took the  producers two years to finish the movie. A process including long hours,  empty pockets and numerous telephone calls to family members for help. Karl  Lauer, legendary wrestling promoter, coordinated the films wrestling moves  and served as Associate Producer.
Careful to cling onto the traditional  conventions particular to the genre yet giving the film a twist all their  own, together the troupe redefined Luch Libre. Like his famed predececcors  Mil Mascaras and Santo, Azul Atomico never takes off his blue nylon mask  (which comes complete with an atom sign on the forehead) Typical of Luch  Libre, complicated wrestling scenes filled with high-flying action and bone  crushing suplexes are sprinkled all over the movie. In one fighting scene,  a 300-pound wrestler does a splash off the top rope, nailing Azul onto the  mat.
In contrast to the tradional larger-than-life wrestling champions,  Azul Atomico is a dumpy, two-bit wrestler who is behind on his rent and  forced to fight in lousy gyms in remote cities.
Like scooping your way  through a bowl of rocky road ice cream, you'll find little morsels of  Chicano Culture hidden within this movie. A special treat for any Latino  with a sweet tooth for comedy is an appearance by Culture Clash, who play  die-hard fans of Azul. El Vez groupies also get their fix when the Mexican  Elvis impersonator graces the screen. Music by El Vez, Los Straitjackets,  Yeska and Viva Malapache with a score composed by Philip Pellitier appear  in the film.",946857600,2,2349,5.089238845144357
