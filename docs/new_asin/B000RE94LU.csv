2864581,5,B000RE94LU,"I had started doing some other exercises and watching what I eat a bit more, but wanted to add yoga to my routine, so I picked up a couple of DVDs by Maggie that amazon had sold together.

This DVD is great if you want to start learning yoga.  It is broken down into three sections to help you get started with shorter workouts and routines then advance further.

Maggie is clear in her instruction and the pacing of the workouts was just perfect.  She describes what the pose is going to help you do and you can move in and out of the poses.

Highly recommended",1200182400,5,562,4.214953271028038
2864582,5,B000RE94LU,I have purchased other yoga/pilates dvd but never followed though. Why? I was simply too inflexible and uncoordinated for most of them--when I bend over I can very touch past my knees and I'm also about 40 pds overweight. But this video is doable for me--the routines are simple and give you time to work into a pose unlike others that move too quickly. I also like how the instructor uses props such as a chair to aid in stability.,1199145600,186,432,4.4125
2864583,4,B000RE94LU,"Essential Yoga for Inflexible People is a DVD which offers a variety of beginning-level yoga practices.  These practices are designed for inflexible people in particular by providing various modifications of traditional yoga poses, including use of props such as a chair and a blanket.  The Main Menu of the DVD offers the following options:

Short Routines--Learn the Basics
Short Routines--Continued
Extended Routines--As You Progress
Credits

Each of the above options is broken up into practice sub-menus as described below.  The times are as listed on the DVD, but I have added my own comments.

SHORT ROUTINES, BASICS
*Sun Salutations with Chair (6m)--2 rounds of sun salutations performed at a slow, modified pace using a chair
*Sun Salutations without Chair (7m)--2 rounds of slow sun salutations, still modified but without the chair
*Standing Poses with Chair (25m)--despite the title, these postures DO NOT use a chair; rather, they are modified standing postures including mountain, triangle, warrior 2, and side stretch
*Standing Poses with Chair II (14m)--this segment actually does use a chair, but only for a few postures; consists mainly of variations on intense side stretch pose

SHORT ROUTINES, CONTINUED
*Seated Poses (9m)--held seated postures including staff pose, cross-leg, cobbler's pose, and hero; a blanket is used
*Forward Bends with Chair (15m)--chair is used to support hands/arms for both standing and seated forward bends; ends with reclined leg stretch using a strap
*Beginning Back Bends (8m)--gentle variations of cobra pose
*Yoga Twists with Chair (11m)--starts with twists seated on chair, then moves to floor for additional seated twists and reclined twists

All of the practices in the final segment, Extended Routines, are made up of the the shorter segments from above; most of the practices add a 5-minute relaxation segment as well.

EXTENDED ROUTINES
*Extended Standing Postures (30m)--both standing segments from above
*Legs (40m)--seated segment, forward bends, seated twists, and relaxation
*AM Wake Up (45m)--seated segment, sun salutations w/chair, 1st standing segment, and relaxation
*Spinal Work in 3 Dimensions (40m)--sun salutations w/o chair, forward bends, back bends, and twists
*Stubborn Hamstrings (65m)--sun salutations w/chair, both standing segments, forward bends, relaxation
*Full Routine (90m)--combines all of the above

Overall, these practices are definitely appropriate for those with little pre-existing flexibility who are new to yoga.  Instructor Maggie Rhoades generally provides good voiceover cues.  However, she moves VERY slowly, often taking several minutes to set up a single pose.  Therefore, anyone with prior yoga experience may become easily bored by these practices, even those with limited flexibility.  Furthermore, although the practices are filmed against the beautiful backdrop of Half-Moon Bay in Antigua, the camera sometimes focuses too much on the scenery and not enough on Maggie, which may make this video challenging for those just starting out with yoga.  For a true beginner who is very flexible and looking for short, modified yoga practices, this DVD might work very well; I would recommended, but it would not be my first choice for either someone new to yoga or someone who is inflexible.",1196035200,103,3291,5.567134268537074
2864584,5,B000RE94LU,"A great DVD for beginners. The pace is excellent for those learning the poses - the speed is relatively slow so the viewer can take the time to move into a pose and focus on attaining correct alignment. The instructions are clear. Rationale and purpose of most (maybe all?) poses are provided as well.
It's also a great DVD for advanced beginners. I am an advanced beginner, and I found that it was helpful to see close-up how my body was supposed to be positioned. Sometimes in yoga class it's hard to see an instructor's subtle movement: you may be in the back of the room, the instructor may not hold the pose because he or she needs to assist students, or you may not be wearing your glasses (like me)!
The video allows you to progress at your own speed. There are routines that focus on one type of pose (eg seated), one body part (eg stubborn hamstrings), and full routines too (eg AM practice). The DVD culminates in a 90 minute routine, which I believe is comprised of other parts of the video.
In summary, it's a great yoga DVD with, ironically, a ton of flexibility  in how it can be used. The scenery is beautiful and Maggie Rhoades' voice is soothing and calming. I highly recommend it!
(Disclaimer: I am actually a student of Maggie's. If you ever have a chance to take a class from her, do it. She is an amazing teacher with a great sense of humor and extraordinary enthusiasm for yoga practice and life.)",1194134400,170,1419,4.436781609195402
2864585,5,B000RE94LU,Essential Yoga for Inflexible People has been a great addition to my fitness program.  I mostly like to do very active cardio type exercise and wanted something in yoga to use to go with that so I can gain some more flexibility.  The shorter routines have been perfect to do after cardio just like the instructor says they are.,1193270400,28,327,4.52542372881356
2864586,5,B000RE94LU,"As someone who is rather inflexible and who is beginning to explore the world of yoga, this is an incredible product.

I like to go to yoga classes, but have trouble fitting that into my schedule and following up in the weeks that pass between classes. So I had tried other yoga videos, but found them to be far too fast paced to follow along, and had pretty much given up on them.

There's a ton on this DVD, something like 3.5 or 4 hours altogether, and it's fun to try and do different parts on different days.

I wanted to give it 6 stars, but amazon only allows 5!",1191542400,179,569,4.154545454545454
2864587,5,B000RE94LU,"My husband is still new to yoga and not very flexible and this DVD is perfect for him. The poses are gentle, varied and easy to follow. He says he feels that my body has increased mobility.  The instruction is very clear and allows him to get into the poses in a non-rushed way. Even though I have been doing yoga for awhile, I also use this DVD from time to time because I like the instructions and flow and to reinforce some elements of my practice.

It was also filmed on a beach, the scenary is gorgeous and is an added bonus.",1191456000,43,530,4.135922330097087
2864588,4,B000RE94LU,"This was my second yoga dvd purchase and while I enjoy it, I would like the flow to be a bit smoother. It's excellent for instruction and gives you plenty of time to get the pose properly executed, but doesn't seem to move from one pose to the other in a free flowing manner.",1190246400,8,275,4.111111111111111
2864589,5,B000RE94LU,"I am a big fan of this DVD. When I saw this title it really interested me and it is great! Not only is it beautiful, but I find the poses very accessible and the instruction clear. It really is a wonderful resource for anyone wanting to start doing yoga(or even who does yoga, but wants to learn the poses in more detail and carefully).",1183075200,15,336,4.184615384615385

2864591,4,B000RE94LU,"No problem with the seller at all, but I thought a person still needed to be quite flexible to do these exercises.  Then again, maybe I am just too inflexible to start with.

2864603,5,B000RE94LU,"I am inflexible...seriously. This was easy yoga to do and I like how it is broken up into several sessions. This allows you to choose how long you want to work out for. It also helps with setting the appropriate skill level for you.
I enjoy this DVD very much.",1416960000,,260,4.22

2864606,5,B000RE94LU,I have been so pleasantly surprised as to how much I am enjoying this DVD. I have tried other yoga DVD's before but I was always frustrated at the pace the instructors would set and the crazy instructions for breathing. Essential Yoga for Inflexible People moves at just the right pace and she doesn't focus on complicated breathing. I feel SO good after I complete a few sessions. I highly recommend this for ANYONE. An added bonus is this DVD isn't full of annoying commercials before the program...it immediately starts off. Also the scenery is gorgeous.,1406851200,,557,4.8125

I have been a dedicated gym rat and runner for many years and recently became interested in yoga to retain broad muscle tone and flexibility. To get started I have been experimenting with yoga DVDs to find one that is challenging but realistic for me to attempt. So far this is my favorite. There are a range of routines from short ""basics"" to extended routines of standing poses. Also, the background instructions are very clear and pleasant to listen to, and the beach background gives me a positive vibe.",1406246400,,555,4.731958762886598

2864611,4,B000RE94LU,This is my first time doing yoga.  The dvd is a good beginning yoga dvd with easy to follow instructions.,1403222400,,105,4.25
2864612,3,B000RE94LU,"I thought trying to stand still and get each muscle perfect in the video was harder than trying to do complicated poses. Pretty scenery in the background and definitely no poses that are really  difficult, just found it hard to stand still for as long as they want you to as a beginner.",1402963200,,286,4.39622641509434
2864613,5,B000RE94LU,"I started out very, very slowly.  In fact, I didn't even play the dvd for eight months.  ;)  But when I did start doing just the five minute exercises every day it definitely helped with my bad knees which I have after decades of standing on a concrete floor for eight or more hours a day.  I was really surprised.  Some of the more advanced techniques are quite beyond me but it's a fun little ritual that I hope will become a daily, (in the evening) thing with me.  I actually enjoy it and after even a short practice, (I don't spend long at it at all) I feel refreshed and tingly.  I think I will look for other yoga dvds that are designed for chubby slackers like myself later on, but this one is great.  I think anyone starting out would find it helpful and especially calming and energizing.  Try this and see. The beautiful background of ocean waves and the simple narration really make this one good.  I feel more connected to my body now.",1399420800,4,947,4.299435028248587

2864615,5,B000RE94LU,"I really like how this video is geared to help inflexible people.  Some nice basic and short routines to start with that has assistance.

Then about 1/2 more that run from 10-25 minutes straight through to increase the length of time as you get stronger.

The later levels have longer workouts (longer than 30 minutes or so) that combine some other moves previously taught, but they work well.",1383868800,,393,4.75

I lost all fear with this video.  This is definitely a good starting point for anyone new to the yoga scene, or flexibility-challenged!  The repetition helps so much, and the background is pleasant enough to keep the necessary repetition from putting you to sleep.

I ordered this because of the good reviews and am glad I did. I have only used it a few times but I love the way the instructer explains everything step by step--I can follow along without having to try to look over at the t.v--she suggests things to do while building your flexibility to make the poses more comfortable and there seem to be a lot of different options for when I get the basic moves mastered.  very happy :)",1374364800,,699,4.2556390977443606

The exercises in the beginning section require flexibility in your back, arms, quads, hamstrings, ankles and more.  Maybe I expected too much or maybe those who CAN do yoga don't have ANY inkling on how hard it it for those with flexibility issues to do yoga.  Yoga on my Wii FIT is much easier than this!  There are no alternative poses or suggestions for those who are too tight - except one (where you're sitting on the ground with your knees bent and feet on the outside of your knees (ouch!) - they tell you to get a foam block to sit on if it hurts...  Like another reviewer said, the menus don't fit with the content (ie said the exercises were with a chair - but they don't use the chair) and my DVD had issues going back to the main menus.  I also noticed the person showing the poses not to follow exactly what the voice over (which was a nice voice) was saying.

The first two routines on it come from this DVD and I ordered it instead. It's great! A lot of the standing poses are with a chair which makes it so much easier. Each day I get a little more flexible and soon will be able to do the included routines without props.

So I got her the stress relief one and it was better for her. I got this one for me now and I love it. It's not easy peasy. It requires a bit of effort but I love the way I feel after I have done the routines. So far I am more limber than I have been in years and this is only a few weeks after purchase. I can actually touch my toes again. I've lost a bit of weight as well and I feel stronger.

2864651,2,B000RE94LU,"I purchased this DVD based on reviews from Amazon customers. I am a beginner in Yoga. My first exposure to the exercise was in the P 90X series and the Jillian Michael yoga DVD. I wanted a supplement to improve my flexibility and to use as a warm up to the Jillian Michael workout as well as a substitute 90 minute routine when my husband has the P90X DVD with him when he is out of town.

I watched the various workouts and I realized I had completely wasted my money. Although I need to work on my flexibility in some areas this video was pretty much useless for me. I suppose I am not as inflexible as I thought. I do not need the chair and I was under the impression that various alternatives would be given for the moves - like a beginner, intermediate, advanced type of thing. The only positive thing I have to say about it is that the backbend portion of the workout series was explained well and I did get a better understanding of how the back stretches work. I found the quality of the video itself to be very choppy. The ""extended workout"" looks like it was just patched together from the shorter workout sessions.

I will be taking this down to half price books and hoping I can get a little money back on it. If you are able to do other basic yoga workouts this DVD is probably too basic.",1301184000,6,1301,4.220883534136546

One of the things I was worried about since I was new to yoga was if this ""beginners, beginning"" tape would be too easy and a waste of money because I needed something more.

When you are getting better with things, you do not need to use the chair or other things and everything is pretty much around the house, such as books if you want to use yoga blocks.

Clear guidance with modifications to start you off then adding more things later on.  The use of the chair was helpful (though there was a typo on one selection on the menu, which is the only thing I found wrong.)

Maggie teaches well. After the first couple of routines I really felt good and felt I could learn yoga, which was something I was not sure of after taking a couple of classes locally.

Beginners do not have enough time to get into a pose correctly, let alone to feel the pose and its effect on their body.

It's something I feel I should start incorporating into my life to not only strengthen and regain my full flexibility, but for the mental / anti-stress effects as well.

I also find the slower pace compared to some other videos to be perfect for me.

This disc is riddled with inconsistencies making it difficult to do even know which routine you should be doing! The menu titles of the routines read either ""with Chair"" or ""without Chair"" but they are not always correct so you think you're choosing a section with the chair, but when the routine is over with, you find that a chair was never even mentioned.

Next, we have the routines themselves. Our ""Yogi"" will say one thing but will be doing something else, which just leads to distraction. As you try to figure out which thing you should be doing, your attention shifts from your body's alignment to over thinking what's going on on the DVD so that you can be comfortable with the idea that you're doing what you're supposed to. Next thing you know, you've hurt yourself.

One more thing and I'll stop: this video moves very slowly, so if you have problems with your knees, for instance, you will spend a significant amount of time putting a lot of pressure on them in certain standing poses. She holds these positions for a long time (15-30 seconds, give or take) and you will feel them.

Overall, this DVD had a lot of potential, but in the end, it failed... miserably. It seemed rushed, with lower-quality camera work, editing and voice-overs. The ""Yogi"" also spends the video smiling like she's in a beauty pageant, which is just silly - it's supposed to be yoga - not cheesy aerobics!

8200022,3,B000RE94LU,"This is actually ""regular"" yoga, done in a series of movements that have no instructions for ""inflexible"" people.  While it is a very good dvd, it is not for anyone who has flexibility issues.
The better dvd to buy is ""yoga for inflexible people"" by bodywisdom media which focuses specifically on one's inflexibility and has  35+  easy to follow routines.  (not sure if I'm allowed to say that here but they'll cut it out if I'm not.)",1471737600,,434,4.597402597402597

8200025,5,B000RE94LU,"Very good instruction with many different workouts included.  Different time lengths of workout, target areas/focuses, and intensities make for more options than I expected which is nice depending how I feel that day or how much time I have.  Better than a competitor's DVD that I have been using for a while.",1446768000,,309,4.923076923076923
