8624008,3,B00GK6WR0O,"I confess that I do not like Arab movies. To me this one is better than most. The filming is reasonable.

The casting is bad. It needs more actors. Today it's not good enough to have one actor playing a boy, then a man and later  an old man similarly an actress playing a girl and then a woman.

The actors however are good. One problem here is that Sadat was in real life not a colourful character, to play him accurately an actor has to adopt such a role. Unfortunately, it does not make for a good film experience. The woman that played Sadat's wife is extremely good.

The story line itself is weak, and I did not really get emotionally involved in the story.",1262131200,,663,4.238095238095238
