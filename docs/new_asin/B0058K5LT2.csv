Everyone needs to watch this film, good clean fun.",1334534400,,113,4.428571428571429
4599534,5,B0058K5LT2,My huband and I first saw some of this story on PBS.  We purchased the DVD's and have really enjoyed the story and the beautiful scenery.  Well worth seeing!,1334275200,,157,4.379310344827586
4599535,2,B0058K5LT2,"I really enjoyed the portions of this I saw on PBS so I ordered the complete set. I was a little hesitant due to the high price but given the seller was the son of the filmmaker, I felt it would be worth it. While the content is great, the shipping was unacceptable. The 4 DVD cases were just put in a simple paper envelope and mailed. Every DVD case I received was broken and even the paper covers inside the clear wrapper were damaged.",1330473600,9,437,4.152941176470589
4599536,5,B0058K5LT2,"We need more shows like this which depict the basics of life and how to survive in the wilderness. The movies are educational and informative. It is very interesting to see how a person can be creative with minimum tools and survive by being aware of one's surroundings and dangers that are present in everyday life. I would highly recommend this series to everyone, especially for family viewing.",1326672000,15,397,4.852941176470588
4599537,5,B0058K5LT2,"This is not only most interesting, but also most educational. I have been to Alaska and can truly appreciate the setting of these magnificent videos.",1326499200,2,149,5.0
4599538,5,B0058K5LT2,"If you love the wilderness, you'll love this 4 disc set of the story of one man who lived alone in a remote area of Alaska for 30 years. It gives a clear picture of how he built his own cabin, furnished it and made a life for himself. Great footage that he films himself through the years, of the wildlife and beauty of the place he calls home.",1325635200,3,344,4.0
4599539,5,B0058K5LT2,love it,1448755200,,7,3.0
4599540,3,B0058K5LT2,I bought this because I wanted to see part 2 of alone in the wilderness with the impression it was his life over the 30 years and as he aged but it was mostly him fishing and taking pictured of the wild animals.  Part one showes all the cool stuff of when he first settled and built his cabin. The other videos are redundant in my opinion.,1405814400,2,339,4.059701492537314
4599541,5,B0058K5LT2,"Hello,
Got it for the hubby for his birthday, he thought it was great & will probably watch it more as the time goes by.

GOD BLESS,
Vicki",1376784000,,138,3.9285714285714284
4599542,4,B0058K5LT2,"If there is one word to describe Dick's Alaska life and adventure, it's relaxing. Whenever my husband and I want to chill out with a DVD (we're in our 60s), we pull out the Dick Proenneke selections and pop one into the DVR. The guy was so laid back yet tenacious and resourceful. He was a real inspiration to adventurers in a very quiet way. We admire this guy.",1366329600,,362,4.260869565217392
4599543,4,B0058K5LT2,I think the first two are the best but the other two are just plain nice to have. A true documentary of a wilderness life. It is older footage bear in mind.,1364947200,,156,3.90625
4599544,5,B0058K5LT2,what a great series on a very courages and brave man.  he was creative and it gives me the sense that i could be creative too.,1363996800,,126,3.8461538461538463
4599545,5,B0058K5LT2,"This is a wonderful product that I didn't rate immediately because of construction in the house but it is one of my all time favorites that I got as a gift for my son in law. My 10 year old granddaughter even loves it and watches it with her dad, who has spent happy hours commenting the whole time, ""This is SO me!"". I rate it five stars because of fascinating content, family appeal, and rapid communication/shipping by Mr. Bob Swerer. You can't go wrong in any way with this DVD or the seller.",1358380800,,496,4.287234042553192
4599546,5,B0058K5LT2,"I ordered this upon recommendation of a friend. I sure am glad I did. It is a great story about a man that wanted a challenge in life and to enjoy something simpler. He built a cabin all alone with an axe and hand tools and lived in the Alaskan wilderness for many years, often going months alone without another human around. I like the 4 disk set I bought. At the bare minimum you need to get part 1 & 2. The other 2 disks round out the set nicely. Do the outdoorsman in your family a favor and get them this set, you will be glad you did. I would also like to mention that when i ordered the set one of the disks came loose during shipping and had a segment that wouldn't play. The seller was nice enough to respond promptly to my email and sent me a new one right away. Excellent service for an excellent product.",1356998400,,817,4.049382716049383
4599547,3,B0058K5LT2,"Alone in the wilderness part one and two is very very good! I recommend it to anyone and everyone loves the outdoors and getting back to basics.

But please note the other two movies in this four Pack, were not very interesting. And the other two movies were mostly made up of scenes you see in the alone in the wilderness movies.

But I guess they were still pretty good... Just my personal preference, I didn't really like them...",1351728000,20,432,4.455696202531645
4599548,5,B0058K5LT2,"and he loves them! he got inspired by mr. P and told me if i ever pissed him off, he was going to Alaska and build his own cabin...I told him it was ok if he went, as long as he left the credit cards! LOL",1343692800,,204,3.4565217391304346
8461679,5,B0058K5LT2,I keep watching these over and over again. He inspires me to live a simpler life and enjoy nature.,1525651200,,98,4.2105263157894735
8461680,5,B0058K5LT2,"My 12-year old son is mesmerized by these videos; most boys have the attention span of gnat before they're off to something else, but my son asks me if we can sit down and watch these for an hour or more. Kids and adults alike are mesmerized by the life and talents of Dick Proenneke shown in this video series. Purchase the set - you won't regret it!",1509667200,,351,4.176470588235294
8461681,5,B0058K5LT2,Love these videos.,1509321600,,18,5.333333333333333
8461682,5,B0058K5LT2,They did a great job with the whole thing. If you liked Grizzly Adams as a kid or Jeremiah Johnson....well....be prepared to enjoy yourself!!...only difference...this guy Dick Prenoke was REAL LIFE not a movie!...best 100 I spent in a  long time id recommend it to anyone. The man was unbelievably self sufficient and totally reminded me of my dad!!! buy it!,1504483200,,358,4.868852459016393
8461683,5,B0058K5LT2,ALL FOUR DVD'S GREAT BUT WHEN THE DVD'S ARRIVED 1 OF THE CASE'S WAS CRACKED BUT NO DAMAGE TO DVD WAS NOT PACKED THAT WELL IN THE PACKAGE.,1490918400,,137,3.9285714285714284
8461684,4,B0058K5LT2,"Love, love, love the DVD's. The reason for 4/5 stars is because the two of the DVD cases were smashed out on both ends.",1486684800,,119,4.0
8461685,5,B0058K5LT2,This will absolutely astound anyone born past 1975. Men used to be quite handy and interesting. We're all totally useless compared men like Eichars Proenekke,1473465600,,157,5.32
8461686,5,B0058K5LT2,"These videos are awesome,I would love to be able to experience this in my life!",1452124800,,79,4.333333333333333
8461687,5,B0058K5LT2,Love them,1451952000,,9,4.0
8461688,5,B0058K5LT2,"Movies like Jeremiah Johnson and Never Cry Wolf have always been like comfort food for me. These are like comfort gravy. If you haven't seen these, oh my gosh, don't wait, or rent or whatever, buy these and own absolute unique footage and world class representation of Dick's life.",1449014400,,281,4.755102040816326
