8533575,1,B0090XK9KY,"I purchased this a few years ago, shortly I had finished the anime. I was so excited to own my own copy of the series as it had become one of, if not my all time, favorite anime.

However, it became quickly apparent that this was quite possibly a bootleg. At the very least, it wasn't a good product.

There are only two disc's in the case which have to fit 13 episodes each. Most series are split up onto multiple discs in order to provide higher quality viewing. With this set however, there is an obvious loss of quality. It's nowhere near a decent definition onscreen, and looks like a youtube video at 240p.

The subtitles are at times very inaccurate which is a minor annoyance, but lends  to the evidence that this is not in any way an official product.

The art used on and in the case is all stolen fanart and even features characters from completely different shows.

In short, this isn't worth paying for if you wish to own the series. Luckily, it was officially released for western audiences not too long ago and it's worth every penny. Any fan of the show should seek out the official blu-ray release as it's not only higher quality in every way, and not only does it come with bonus content including an Episode 0, but it also helps support the studio that helped bring us this wonderful show.",1518825600,,1308,4.406639004149378

8533577,5,B0090XK9KY,"When I get stressed out about the mass criticism of my favorite Sentai (Ninninger), I often turn to other sources of entertainment to relieve myself.

Enter Nichijou, an anime I came across by SEARCHING THROUGH JOHN CENA MEMES. (Not even kidding- this was what I found: https://youtu.be/ZGTVPzyBU-A). Unlike other typical cliched schoolgirl animes, this one is leagues beyond- well, pretty much everything!

We'll start with the basics. There is no plot since this is a comedy anime, so we can skip that.

In my opinion, there are eight characters worth keeping track of; maybe there's a few that are worth looking at, but a lot of them (mostly men- feminism at its best) aren't that interesting.

*Aioi Yuuko: An optimist, slightly dimwitted girl with INSANELY HILARIOUS REACTIONS.
*Naganohara Mio: She has athletics around average but never manages to pull through with instructions. In her freetime, she writes slightly... disturbing manga. Oh, and she has physics-defying hairpins.
*Minakami Mai: A quiet, seemingly-emotionless character who is somehow amazingly adept at trolling.
*Shinonome Nano: A highly-advanced(?) cyborg robot. There's no way you'd figure out she's a robot... aside from the giant key in her back that ends up being a dead giveaway. Also her arms pop off from time to time.
*Shinonome Hakase: An eight-year old professor who somehow managed to graduate already, because... why not. She built Nano and often pulls random pranks.
*Sakamoto: A runaway cat given a scarf that allows speech; he acts as a ""parental"" figure to Nano and Hakase. But he's still a cat. You'll find out what that means eventually.
*Tachibana Misato: A tsundere that somehow pulls projectile weapons out of nowhere and shoots others if they make her uncomfortable about her romance life.
*Sasahara Koujirou: A gentleman character. Mio has a crush on him... and so does Misato, although anyone who mentions this gets shot.

There really aren't many other characters worth talking about, but in all seriousness these eight are enough.

Most of the humor comes from the downright hysterical reactions, including but not limited to:

*""D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-DOPPIO?!""
*""SUPERULTRAGREATDELICIOUSWONDERFUL HARD TO UNDERSTAND!!""
*The ABSENCE of any reactions at the shrine.
*Literally every time Misato shoots someone (usually Sasahara)
*Yakisaba. Yakisoba. That is all.
*Yuuko clicks her pen... the other way.
*Yuuko and Mio try to figure out if Nano is a robot.
*And much more.

When it drifts away from just reactions, the humor is equally as funny, including:

*Superglue... which is literally a super-sized, super-sticky adhesive.
*Yuuko attempts to catch a falling sausage. Hilarity ensues.
*A pumpkin is made of concrete. Trying to break it is hard.
*Three words: Mio runs away.
*And much more.

To sum it up, Nichijou is a ridiculously hysterical reactionfest, and that's not a bad thing. I'm gonna have to recommend this to everyone. 6/5 stars!",1448064000,3,2941,5.291845493562231
8533578,2,B0090XK9KY,"I really love Nichijou and the anime itself is great but when I ordered this exact one but off of eBay I discovered that the quality was just terrible and I couldn't even watch it, it was so bad. This kind of thing may not bother some people but if you can't watch a movie/show that has less than average quality I don't recommend this.",1422057600,2,336,4.184615384615385
8533579,5,B0090XK9KY,"I streamed this show from crunchyroll and really enjoyed it. I came to this site to purchase it, because i purchase everything from amazon. It is not here, i will wait like everyone else here to purchase it.

The show follows a few different people on different time lines that eventually come together in a way only this show could produce. It was a very funny show where i was caught laughing for 5 minutes over a silly joke, like pushing a mechanical pencil down on the wrong side and getting a blood blister. Because, in my ordinary life, i have done this. The day i can purchase this show, i will.",1368489600,4,602,4.375
8533580,5,B0090XK9KY,"I have to say I've been waiting since ""Nichijou"" first aired for it to come out on DVD, the slapstick comedy is unbelievably unusual, but very enjoyable to watch over and over. If you love comedy anime, this show is definitely for you. I am waiting for them to(hopefully) make another season of it, I can not get enough!

Though it is on amazon for sale, it is ""currently unavailable"" this is upsetting, but I'll just wait until Viz, or Funimation dubs it to buy it(and hopefully they make the English version just and enjoyable as the Japanese one).

P.S. Though this anime is GREAT, the only genre it falls in is Comedy, there is no variety in terms of genre(that I can think of), Which usually turns people off, but this comedy does it right!",1353283200,11,745,4.470588235294118
8533581,5,B0090XK9KY,"Do you like existential comedies? This show has moments that will make you roll on the floor laughing while also warming your heart in the next episode. Kyoto Animations has been producing really good stuff for awhile now and I love that they tried something new instead of the same old formula as present everywhere else in anime. Check out some clips on youtube first if your'e unsure, but overall this is a really solid choice and is definitely watchable more than once.",1350518400,15,473,4.710843373493976
