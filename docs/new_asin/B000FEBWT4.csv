8121463,5,B000FEBWT4,"My son loves it.  It's a nice, non-conflict, DVD story for all ages.  I really like Jay Jay because there is no content that could be potentially upsetting to my son.",1222732800,,166,4.32258064516129
8121464,5,B000FEBWT4,"My 5-year old daughter absolutely loves the Mysteries!  She's spouting information that she learned for hours after each episode.  ""Momma, did you know...""  These are great for a pre-K!",1218326400,,185,5.310344827586207
8121465,4,B000FEBWT4,Since this is a DVD it gets marginal kudos..a gift for a grandson...content better than a lot of 'children's ' dvd's but still passive entertainment with no creativity....,1198368000,,171,5.142857142857143
8121466,4,B000FEBWT4,"I was a little annoyed when I learned about the ""Jay Jay's Mysteries"" changes to the new episodes. And I really freaked out when we didn't hear the familiar theme song. BUT give these a chance. They focus on teaching concepts like shapes, sizes and the five senses.  (And Brenda blue gets an actual tool belt, which makes a heck of a lot more sense than the red belt she used to wear with her coveralls.)  In addition to these new mysteries, this DVD features some ""old school"" -- style episodes, complete with the old theme song.  So this is a good mix of the old and new. And my kids seem to really enjoy Lena.",1159315200,3,612,4.258620689655173
8121467,1,B000FEBWT4,"My son and I anxiously awaited the release of a new Jay Jay the Jetplane DVD and I must say both of us were immensely disappointed.  The format was different from former episodes and focused was primarily Jay Jay and the new plane, Lena.  Brenda Blue was a huge focus as well, as most of the talking was done between Brenda and the planes.  (Why they can't just let Brenda wear her hair down is beyond me, she's prettier than they're making her look - she looked strange in the backwards baseball cap.)

Tracy made an appearance for a few seconds, but that was it.  It's apparent that they're trying to copy Dora the Explorer with the Spanish speaking character - but they went over the top with it.  Lena is a cute character but should not have been focused on so heavily.

All in all, if you like the older Jay Jay episodes and were looking forward to some new ones - I think you'll be disappointed.  I would rent this DVD first before spending the money to buy it.",1155081600,7,967,4.303867403314917
