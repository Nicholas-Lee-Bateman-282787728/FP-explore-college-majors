4559467,5,B00545D5TY,A great production!  It makes me feel as though I am right there on the streets of Venice.  Love the characters and the story line.,1361145600,,131,4.2
4559468,5,B00545D5TY,"We have the entire set and are only disappointed that we now are at the last of this series. We hope there will be more. Donna Leon is one of my favourite authors, and the movies are great. Sometimes I take exception to some of the changes, but overall we enjoy them all. Only one surprise, the movies are in German. Course we turn them to English, but what a surprise, German when the setting of course is Venice. As for the movies they are better than a travel CD.",1359590400,2,466,4.188888888888889
4559469,4,B00545D5TY,"My mother turned me on to the Brunetti books, so I ordered the series for her (she speaks German), and I knew these were in German when I ordered them. The episodes are beautifully filmed (I know Venice well), and so far seem faithful to the books. I am however having a hard time getting used to the lead actors speaking German, especially when you can hear Italian being spoken in the background in several scenes.

A well done TV series, but the gutteral German against the visuals of Venice is an odd disconnect.",1355875200,3,516,4.48936170212766
4559470,1,B00545D5TY,"In German?  That is a deal breaker for me I am afraid, though I love the books.  I will admit that I have not seen these productions - full disclosure - and I will wait for an Italian production or stick to the books.",1336694400,,217,3.909090909090909
4559471,1,B00545D5TY,"Both DVDs were defective and couldn't be played.  Be sure to save all packing materials so you can return them.  I didn't so am stuck with having paid and bad DVDs.  Ordered 3 sets - the Episodes 1, 2 was fine, but the Episodes 3,4, and Episodes 5,6 were both defective and couldn't be played at all.  Sad ...",1333324800,3,309,4.186440677966102
4559472,4,B00545D5TY,"I must confess that I am a Donna Leonaphile--anything she writes or produces, I want to read or sample.  But, I must also confess being dumbfounded by this excellent series, one of Brunetti's best, once the DVD arrived.  Here is an American-born author, writing about a Venetian man, his family and his beloved city, but the dubbing was not in Venetian, or Italian or English, but in German!  Go figure!  Thank goodness the subtitles were in English, or I would have had to return all episodes.  I'm grateful for the series, but was a bit internationally challenged.  Thank you.",1332806400,,578,4.787878787878788
4559473,5,B00545D5TY,I've read all the books from this series by Donna Leon. The DVD's are true to the books as well as the characters who play the key roles. I only wish they were speaking Italian rather than German but it's still all good.,1329177600,4,220,4.1395348837209305
4559474,5,B00545D5TY,"Love her books and seeing them in video is fabulous.  Hope Amazon has other Brunetti episodes.  Please let me know if you do or when you get them.

4559475,5,B00545D5TY,"The television version of two of Donna Leon's popular books about a Venetian Detective. Produced by a German company in German, but with English subtitles, which work well. Photographed mostly, if not totally in Venice. Loved the books, loved these productions, definitely recommend them. We have now also purchased episodes 1 & 2.",1311465600,10,331,5.264150943396227
4559476,5,B00545D5TY,"We were unsure about a Brunetti in Deutsch, but it works well.  Like the second Brunetti better and the first Paola.",1427155200,,116,4.523809523809524

4559481,4,B00545D5TY,"Finally found!  I love the Brunetti mystery novels..what a treat to find the films.  If you don't mind subtitles, these films are excellent versions of the novels!",1405728000,,163,5.0
4559482,4,B00545D5TY,I have read all of the Brunetti mysteries and was expecting the movies to be in Italian with English subtitles. I was surprised to find they were in German. Next time I'll read the fine print.,1394064000,3,192,4.361111111111111
4559483,4,B00545D5TY,While it took awhile to get used to a Venetian series being in German the movies are a good adaption of the books.,1393459200,,114,4.0
4559484,4,B00545D5TY,"These stories show the Italian and Viennese people and their ancient culture through Donna Leon' stories. Many of the stories have a dark and depressing side but the family life and characters of the story bring it to life. I enjoy these German made films, in German with English subtitles.",1376956800,,290,4.82
4559485,5,B00545D5TY,"Absolutely love this series: fantastic setting (Venice), great acting, great plots, and it's in German. What? Yes, when I began watching the fist episode in Series 1, I have purchased Series 1-6, I thought my hearing was going bad. I am reading the English subtitles and hearing German, not Italian. No problem at all, since the subtitles are very well done, but somewhat a surprise. Brunetti is definitely on the same excellent level as other Italian detective series, such as ""Fog & Crimes"" and ""Montalbano.""",1369353600,6,510,5.011764705882353
8456264,2,B00545D5TY,"I will not add what others have said about dubious and changing casting. This I would be  ready to live with, as long as the main character which is Venice itself was adequately showcased. But it is not. I believe this is not the creators fault  but the fault of Mhz and the image compression techniques they used. The DVD  is produced by MMz and like the Inspector Montalbano  DVD's I have purchased from them, the image quality is horrible. These series, Montalbano and Brunetti feature beautiful settings  and this is an important part of the story for the aficionados  I purchased the DVD's rather than streaming from MHZ in order to get a better image for my large screen TV and to be able to fully appreciate the quality of the series. The Inspector Brunetti images are a bit better than The Montalbano. The backgrounds are a bit sharper. However nothing similar to a good quality DVD. Also on some Brunetti DVDs, when the camera moves the background moves in a stuttering fashion which is very annoying. These are most probably artifacts from the compression process used. Not recommended.",1526169600,,1096,4.742105263157895

8456267,5,B00545D5TY,Donna Leon's books are way up among my favorites.  I never pass up the chance to read one.  The Guido Brunetti are the best but all her writing is worth reading.,1482710400,,161,4.161290322580645
8456268,5,B00545D5TY,Found the books in a small bookstore in Venice 10 years ago and have read them all. So excited to have the DVDs and I have the complete series. They follow the books very well. Love the scenery. Their apartment is very close to the apartment we rent. Actors are perfect. Wish they were in Italian,1466035200,,296,4.303571428571429
