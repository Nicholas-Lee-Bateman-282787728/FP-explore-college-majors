Really enjoyed Deborah Raffin's performance. made me think of ""Romancing the Stone"" mixed with ""Creature from the Black Lagoon."" Maybe one day her other film ""Touched by Love"" with Diane Lane will be released on DVD.",1420070400,,273,4.829787234042553

7906608,5,B00000F4FW,"This is a pretty funny movie. I've loved it for many years and created a drinking game to go with it to make it even funnier. I first saw this movie on tv about 25 or 30 yrs ago and loved it thot it was so funny and loved Fondas character although Deborahs character of the dr was quite annoying. I winced every time she shot another one of his bottles lol I looked for the movie for years on vhs but never found it, however i recently found it online and introduced it a good friend who helped make up a drinking game to make it even more enjoyable to watch, so here he is with the rules! You take a hefty shot of hard liquor (vodka or something similiar) every time the doctor addresses the pilot with the name ""Mr. Bidicker"". She does it quite often and its a lot of fun. You also have to do two shots of liquor every time Estaban says ""Drink"" to the doctor. It's great  to just get friends over, lay out enough liquor, and have fun viewing!",1364342400,,944,4.075268817204301
