8456101,5,B0035ZZ9NA,"I like the picture being 16:9. I like the story. I like the action and violence. I like all the shooting, punching and kicking.",1507075200,,127,4.333333333333333
8456102,5,B0035ZZ9NA,"Great effort from upcoming stars and good entertainment from limited resource studio collaboration.  The storyline shows a depth of perception of decadence in very urban cities like New York, Chicago, Los Angeles,.....  The actors were exceptional in conveying a fast and violent lifestyle that is nothing but deadly.  The studio did not expend a 100 million dollars in making this movie and that showed the great commitment of this collaboration in doing their professional best as entertainers.  The movie's premise and continuity is good, the actors performed well and the production showed talent when compared to 100 million dollar productions.  Great effort.",1506988800,,664,5.470588235294118

8456104,1,B0035ZZ9NA,"this feels like something kids in high school would put together, I don't know how it still has a 4 star rating, this one is so bad it's beyond the realm of funny and becomes a chore to watch. The editing is bad, videography is bad, acting is bad, and sound is horrendous with it dropping off and getting quiet whenever an actor turns away or walks away from the camera.",1506470400,,370,4.225352112676056
