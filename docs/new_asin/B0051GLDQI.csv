4521565,5,B0051GLDQI,"I may be biased because I am a fan of Jillian since the 30 Day Shred came out and I have all of her DVDs, but I got to say, she does not disappoint on this one.  I consider myself advanced and I felt the burn on Level 1.  Like she said, if it is too easy, just add weights and problem solved.  But even without weights, it burns.

The only thing I noticed that was inconsistent is it says the workouts are 30 minutes long, but they are actually between 40-45 minutes long (Level 1 about 40min, Level 2 about 42min and Level 3 about 45min).  I guess if you don't count the warm-up and cool-down, then they are 30min of strict strength/cardio training.

And for those people that get annoyed and actually pay attention to what she is saying, she complains a lot about people saying on Facebook and Twitter that her workouts are too easy and how that pisses her off and she mentions that a few times.  Not a big deal, but I know people get annoyed about stuff like that.

If you own her other DVDs, you will notice she incorporates a lot of the moves from 30Day Shred and Ripped in 30, especially on the Level 3 workout.  That being said, it doesn't feel like you are doing the same workout as in the other DVDs.  I like that these workouts focus on the lower body because I am sure they burn a lot more calories.",1315267200,402,1310,4.162698412698413

4521569,5,B0051GLDQI,"I bought this DVD two years ago, and it's still my favorite. I did these workouts for 5-6 days a week for 3 months (sometimes swapping one day out for a different DVD of hers to mix it up) and lost about 35 lbs. I've kept the weight off since then via leading a way more active lifestyle, but I'm just getting back around to doing this DVD again for the first time in almost a year, and I'm excited.  The comparison picture is from my first round with this DVD, January 22nd-April 22nd of 2016.",1515628800,17,494,4.145833333333333

4521571,4,B0051GLDQI,"These workouts will definitely make you sweat! Even though it is focused on lower body, it feels like a full body workout, especially for your shoulders--there are a lot of plank-based moves in this. I was actually underwhelmed by level 3--I thought level 2 was harder! But it's worth it to go back through all the levels and add heavier weights each time to get the most out of it. I lost 2 sizes and 10 lbs in the 2 months I did this (3X a week every OTHER week. I did not need to lose weight, I was more focused on building muscle, so I was actually happy with these results). My only complaint is that Jillian's constant silly comments were a little irritating, but that is par for the course with her workout dvds. As long as I get results, she can say whatever she wants.",1514937600,2,777,4.256756756756757

4521575,5,B0051GLDQI,"I have only been doing it a week (4 times last week, once the other day on Level 2 and today again) I can ALREADY feel/see a difference in my legs. It's pretty tough and kinda fast paced in Level 2 but even if you go at your own pace, you will still see results. I can't wait to see what the results will be in 3 more weeks. This will definitely be my go to workout for my legs for the future! Stick to it, be consistent and you will be very happy :)",1511308800,,450,3.7473684210526317
4521576,5,B0051GLDQI,"Great Jillian workout. I have about 10 of her DVDs and find myself doing the workouts from this one the most. About 90-95% of the exercises do not require weights, and those that do can be done without weights (although they obviously wouldn't be as challenging), so even if you do not have weights at home you can still get a very good workout. As always, Jillian makes very hard workouts (even level 1) that burn and strengthen your body, and keeps things interesting with many exercises you haven't seen before.

The burped are a little tough to do exactly as demonstrated especially with previous knee injury, but able to find great alternative to still keep up the burn. This is not overly challenging, but you will feel your heart rate go up, which is great for the fat burn. Highly recommend if 35 minutes is all you got.",1503792000,,371,4.23943661971831
4521584,5,B0051GLDQI,You will sweat your ass off. I play soccer and run regularly. I wanted something for inside on rainy days. I've now bought multiple Jillian Michaels workout DVDs and I love them all. I've done Yoga Melt down and 6 weeks to six-pack. I just purchased Killer Arms and Back and can't wait to try it. these work outs have multiple level. I switch DVDs each workout to get a good overall variation and am still on level one of all of them. The first level of these has so many ways to increase intensity it makes the same routine harder each time you do it. I like that they focus on a main body part while still adding those little extras to support your overall body. Yoga meltdown is great to start with! it is more of an over all body workout!,1500681600,,742,4.195804195804196
4521585,5,B0051GLDQI,very good video.  I am in decent shape (or so I thought!).  Very sore afterwards and that was only level one.  Happy to have a video I can do at home.

I've gotten injuries from other hiit dvds and I love how this video focuses more on form than intensity.  I feel the burn already!

4521591,2,B0051GLDQI,"I bought this years ago. I started to get really into it, and eventually did one of these workouts several times a week, usually the third one.  It did make my butt look FINE. However, I'm pretty sure that this program is flawed. I don't have a lot of confidence in Jillian Michaels' authority when it comes to precision and form. I say this because it was while I was doing these workouts heavily that I developed a hip and back issue that has been debilitating, chronic, and painful. My hips are unstable, constantly popping in and out of place. My hips are obviously misaligned, and I think that caused extra stress on my back, which caused heavy inflammation and disc degeneration. I can't prove it was Jillian Michaels' videos that caused these problems (and subsequent thousands of dollars of medical care), but I think it was. I would never wish this health experience on anyone. Do at your own risk.",1498780800,,907,4.633540372670807
4521592,5,B0051GLDQI,The name doesn't lie! This video kills your buns and thighs but it is very effective. Jillian gives every exercise a weird name but they do kill your buns and thighs and are effective at shedding calories and toning. She did not disappoint yet again!,1498694400,,250,4.5777777777777775
4521593,5,B0051GLDQI,"After seeing other reviews I was kinda skeptical....not sure should I buy this or not, but since I am a fan of Jillian Michaels, and I really got bored with the videos I have now, I decided to give it a try.

I just finished level 1, and it turned out to be a good buy for me! However I would not recommend beginner to start with this DVD. I have done several Jillian's DVD for the past two months. I always hate the lunge move, even I am doing better now, I still hate it, and there are even more lunges in the level 1 video I just watched.

Comparing to Jillian's 30 Day Shred, this one is definitely harder, but if you have done 30 Day Shred level 1, I think you will be good with this one (I guess the Killer Bun level 1 difficulty level is about the same as 30 day shred level 2?).

If you are looking for new moves(ok just for me, I didn't watch all her videos), and more challenges, I would recommend this DVD! I have done ""No more trouble zone"", ""30 day shred"", ""6 week 6 pack"", and part of ""ripped in 30"". So I can tell it is a mixture of everything and some new things! I can't wait for level 2 and level 3 now.

I tried cleaning the DVD although it looked fine and put it back in my brand new Blue Ray/DVD player and it continued to do the same thing. I had similar problems with 6W6P and KA&B and am returning for a refund. Not reordering as I'll probably end up with more defective DVDs since many others have complained of the same thing.

4521621,2,B0051GLDQI,"The workouts are awesome  -- 5-stars all the way. Holy quad burn!!! And the way she shows you how to make moves even more difficult has actually helped me breathe new life into some of her other workouts that I've had for years. (I jump during more of the lunging moves in Six-Week Six-Pack now.) However, the disc quality was absolutely terrible. No one wants to have their workout stop mid-way through, then inexplicably jump back to the main menu screen, forcing you to restart the workout, fast-forward to where you left off, only to have the same thing happen over and over and over again. I of course washed the disc and was then able to progress through a few more moves only to have the same issue repeat. I took excellent care of the disc. I had only used it a handful of times before this started happening. I have a suspicion that my copy was pirated or made-on-demand. In addition to the issue I described above, the print quality of the DVD cover art as well as the image quality on the disc decal was not of the same caliber as the other Jillian DVDs I own. I've had no issues with any of my other discs. If you choose to order, just know two things: 1) you might get a faulty disc, and 2) all three of these workouts are available on YouTube. I personally like having the disc, but when I purchase again, it won't be through WeeBee CD's N Stuff (Amazon fulfilled the order though, so not sure who's really at fault).",1485129600,5,1431,4.33955223880597

 A little background about myself to help others- I am in my upper 20's trying to lose 5-10 pounds and tone up. For the past month and a half, I have done this workout 4-6 times a week on a rotating basis so I don't get bored (level 1- day 1, level 2- day 2, level 3- day 3, repeat).  There are modifiers that help you out, so don't be intimidated by going up a level.  As Jillian says, just move and get out of your comfort zone.  So far I have lost two inches off of my hips.  I had been doing the 21 Day Fix, and 21 Day Fix Extreme and this has been the most effective at toning my lower body.

I have been searching far and wide for a workout that would isolate and tone my buns and thighs in a 20 or 30 minute period effectively but I never really found anything besides thousands of basic squats, lifts and curls, and yoga.  However, Jillian Michaels took the time to painstakingly sculpt the. perfect. bun. thigh. workout! I Nothing else is as effective.

You get three different levels and yes, they can all be a killer! She is less chatty in this video, in my opinion but you can always turn down the volume once you get a hang of the routine.

4521660,5,B0051GLDQI,"I am pretty good about doing a home workout DVD about 5-6 times a week. I have tried several of Jillian's programs, several in The Firm series, more Beachbody programs than I care to admit, and a few random ones for good measure (Billy Blanks, prenatal workouts, and a few Bellydance). That being said, I am not athletic. I hate working out but do so because it is the healthy thing to do. I would classify my level as ""lower level advanced"". I am certainly not a beginner but by no means am I a super toned athlete.

As a way to kind of organize my own DVD collection, I wanted to go through and rate them all so I can quickly grab exactly the kind of workout I am looking for that day, rather than try to think ""hmm, is this the good ab one or the good thigh one?"". Posting them here on Amazon for all to benefit from.

Killer Buns and Thighs includes 3 levels of a bun/thigh workout on one DVD. Here are some notes/stats:

Time: Warm-ups are around 6:30 each and Cool down are 4 minutes each, total time working out is between 40-45 minutes.

Skill Level: What I love about JM is that there is always a modifier for beginners. That being said, this is not her easiest workout (even at Level 1). Level 3 is especially hard, though they all have really challenging bits. I am still challenged by them, so I can safely say beginners and advanced alike will be able to make this workout a challenge for them.

Equipment: If you have a hard workout surface, you will want a mat since you spend time of the floor. You will also need weights. I used a set of 3#, 8#, and 10# (though I plan on upping the 3s to 5s next time). You will also need a chair (to step up on) for level 2.

Breaks: Breaks are very minimal- just a few seconds in between circuits.

Format: 4 circuits at about 8 minutes each. Each circuit has 4/5 moves and repeats twice. This is not the same circuit format Jillian sometimes uses with the 3-2-1 method (3 minutes of cardio, 2 minutes of strength, 1 minute of abs). Here are some notes I took during each workout:

Level1: Circuit 1: #thighs #lower back. No, seriously, my thighs are killing already!
  Circuit 2: #cardio (lots of cardio)- out of breath
  Circuit 3: Old school floor work- good for the #butt
  Circuit 4: Kicks, balance work, cardio, lower back is feeling it again (is my form  wrong?)

Thoughts: Level 1 is not ""easy"". Your butt will be feeling it. If you can make it past circuit 3, you'll be fine :)

Level 2: Circuit 1: Lots of #plyo, jumping #thighs burning #squats
  Circuit 2: Nice mix of core, balance work, and cardio with a dash of arms
  Circuit 3: lunges, burpees, kneeling pop-ups- this circuit is not kind if you have bad knees so be sure to modify if necessary
  Circuit 4: DYING. Just when you thought your thighs couldn't handle anymore you have leg extensions, side lunges, some lateral hops and STAR JUMPS. Ow.

Thoughts: This is a high impact workout. Great for a cardio/thigh workout. I didn't feel it in my butt (especially compared to Level 1). I could not do every rep and there were plenty of modifiers to make it easier or even harder. It was difficult, but in a good way.

Level 3: Circuit 1: On the floor on your stomach- resistance/strength challenge right away
  Circuit 2: jumps, lunges, nice modifiers (still hard)
  Circuit 3: #quads burning, #squats #kicks, #butt starting to feel it
  Circuit 4: (favorite!!) floorwork for the buns- my booty was really feeling it by the end

Thoughts: There is a fair amount of laying on your stomach and back. Great great lower body workout that hits both buns and thighs.

Overall, I think this is my favorite JM workout (and I have reviewed several of them). These workouts are challenging and are so versatile in terms of the level/modifiers. The ONLY downside (for me) is that they are SO LONG. I usually like to keep my workouts at around 25-30 minutes so unfortunately I don't get to do this one as often as I would like. I wish my 16 month old would let me do more but alas- I do what I can!

Note: If you have bad knees I would stay away from this one (or just be sure to modify)",1470009600,15,4094,4.336399474375821

As a semi-sedentary middle-aged woman (not into fitness), I found the three DVDs to be fantastic for getting into shape. I will say that level 1 is difficult if you are not a regular exerciser. Some of the exercises were challenging for me to do (logistics -- not enough upper body strength to maneuver into the proper position). However, will practice and regular use, I did see great results. I would say that of the three DVDs, I found the ""30 Day Shred"" to be most effective at improving my cardio capacity and my strength. The other two were challenging, and provided different results. If you are looking for a great workout, and don't want to spend a lot of time, then consider any of Jillian Michael's workouts.

Level 1, which is about 38 minutes total (including the warm up and cool down) struck me as the most aerobic, whereas Levels 2 and 3 (slightly longer, but really not much) had more plyometric moves and much more jumping up and down in general.  I will say this: I've done Level 1 many times, as it's my favorite of the three Levels and is a great workout (I'm not as much of a fan of jumping up and down for 30 minutes), but I definitely felt the burn more in Levels 2 and 3.  The difficulty difference between Levels 2 and 3 is minimal, in my opinion -- both are hard, but doable.  I'm a runner, and all 3 workouts provide excellent strength training to complement and tone.

4521839,5,B0051GLDQI,"I'm 51 years old and past menopause by two years. After several years of no exercise, I was afraid it would be difficult to drop the extra weight. Four months ago I purchased Jillian's Body Revolution through an individual and completed it. Then I purchased a trio of DVD's from Amazon and another one from Wal-Mart. In that short time, I have dropped all the extra weight and have muscles in places previously unachieved. All of the DVD's so far have been doable, and I'm not an athletic person. The key is to follow her instructions and keep moving. I also found that you should not keep doing a certain level until you feel comfortable doing it. The point is to always be pushing your body.  Jump right in there and trust the system. I should also note that I only do one session of exercise about 6 days a week with a moderate change in my diet. I wanted a system that I could live my life with and be consistent with beyond getting back into my  clothes. I've never had anything be as effective as these DVD's, and I'm old school Jane Fonda material.",1456099200,12,1055,4.377551020408164

4521844,1,B0051GLDQI,"Ok, so I realize I'm a beginner in fitness, but that's the whole reason I got a DVD, to learn some routines instead of having to go to a gym and be totally overwhelmed. I liked the fact that this DVD has a beginners routine, so I started it, and I was SO overwhelmed and confused right from the beginning. Jillian ZOOMS through without explaining how to DO the exercises involved in the routine, just assuming we all know how to do them, and it's super fast and it was so hard to keep up that I turned it off within probably three minutes. Am I just too much of a beginner for this DVD? I thought beginner meant the instructor would walk you through the poses. I'm really annoyed.",1455580800,13,680,4.2384615384615385

It is like they have this weird S & M dynamic going on and the rest of us (and Anita) are on the outside watching and feeling uncomfortable. In my opinion, Jillian has lost what made 30 Shred such a hit. In 30 Day Shred, she got straight to business and focused on giving you helpful tips. Natalie and Anita were great supports and were not distracting. As a result, you focused on the workout, not their personalities. In this dvd (as well as in Ripped in 30), Jillian comes on way too strong. She's obnoxious and way too interested in teasing Natalie or complaining about what others have said on social media about her past workouts than giving good instruction. I am not sure why they thought this was a good idea. Also, would it hurt them to put more clothes on Natalie?  In Level 1 she is so scantily clad that I was worried something would pop out during one of the jumps. While the workout is good, I wish Jillian would go back to her roots...subdued, focus on the movement, and encouraging. I miss this.",1442361600,7,1170,4.391705069124424

4521945,4,B0051GLDQI,"This DVD has 3 workouts - all around 35-40 minutes long (she says ""under 30 minutes"" at one point and that is not accurate - none of the workouts go under 30). The workouts are listed as 3 different levels of difficulty, but my experience doing them is that they are all about the same level. Which is actually great - it means for under $9, you get three great lower body workouts, and because you can rotate them, you won't get sick of them as quickly as if you stuck with just level 1 for weeks, then 2, etc. ! That's the good news - three great workouts, none of which are too difficult for a true beginner and none of which are un-modifiable to the point that they wouldn't be challenging to someone in great shape. The exercises themselves are varied - a little yoga, a little barre inspired, some old school buns-of-steel moves, tried and true squats & lunges, and cardio bursts - so you get it all done!
As for what I don't love: first of all, she takes breaks between each exercise, and even though we are only talking about a few seconds, it bugs me that she doesn't keep it moving. Also, Jillian herself is an acquired taste - you either love her or you don't - and sometimes her awkwardness/annoying comments are more than I can take in the early morning hours. I've gotten better at ignoring her, and I always turn off the last few minutes/cool down and do my own stretches.
I've done each workout 3 times each (completing all 3 each week), and I'm hoping for results after 6-8 weeks on this plan! Wish me luck!",1433808000,2,1524,4.3321678321678325
4521946,5,B0051GLDQI,"I bought this DVD at Target, but I've been impressed enough with it that I wanted to review it. I love it. I was slim with an okay shape before my first child. After that, I worked really hard and got into the best shape of my life. Then I had my second child and experienced autoimmune issues after delivery. I am far from the best shape of my life. I alternate this dvd with the 30 Day Shred and an 80% clean diet. I'm getting results fast!

This dvd has 3 workouts that vary in level of intensity from beginner to advanced. She claims that they're about 30 minutes, but the warm up and cool down tack on extra time. I think closer to the 40-45 minute mark is more accurate. Get ready to do lots of plank based moves, kicks, pylo based moves, balancing, squats, and lunges. There's even lots of old fashioned mat work which I enjoy. I feel the burn while I'm doing the moves, and I even feel a nice burn afterward. Sometimes I have to stop and take a 2 minute water break to get my energy level up enough to complete the workouts. I think this dvd is moderately challenging for the novice and probably much easier for the athlete. The higher impact/ real calorie burning moves are broken up by easier exercises to help you keep going, and I find that several of the moves give modest arm and core work along with the lower body work.

I'm already seeing improvements in my knees which are one of my least favorite areas as well as the lift in my bottom which is a true problem area. As a pear shaped wannabe athlete who wants better fitness and a more attractive shape, I will be using this dvd again and again.",1433808000,8,1613,4.233766233766234

I'd been doing my butt bible dvd for a couple years and really like it, but just felt that I was at a plateau. So I got this DVD. And I did level 1 on wed, level 2 on fri, and level 3 on the following wed. Literally after neat doing this dvd 3 times I've seen a difference in my thighs. The tone in my thighs and knees in just 3 days is amazing. Jillian is not hard to follow at all, and most of the time I'm doing the advanced,not beginner, workouts. I really love it. I think the HIIT cardio is making the difference. Coupled with the fact that, except for 1 or 2 moves, each level has different moves. So it keeps it interesting.

4521979,5,B0051GLDQI,"Now, let me start by saying I love ALL of Jillian's DVDs. She is the reason I have gotten as fit as I am now. Anyways, this is the best lower body workout you will get. I would like to say that level 2 is either a TAD bit harder than level 3, or just as hard. I mean, the warm-up in level 2 is even a bit more intense than the other ones. Yes, they are tough. I do not think this is a beginner DVD at all, even though there is a level one. It's still challenging. However, you can work your way up to this DVD. I am telling you, my legs burn...and a GOOD burn. I mean, it feels like my legs are on fire! Not only does it work legs, it give your entire body a nice cardio workout, so you can burn extra fat elsewhere. Jillian (well, and Billy Blanks from Tae Bo) are the only two workout instructors I trust. I have other DVD's, and they do not hold a candle to either of them.

4521990,3,B0051GLDQI,Too much jumping.  Very hard on my knees.  I have to improvise and run around the house during the jumping jacks and mountain climbers.  IMO this is an advanced exercise video.,1427760000,2,176,4.612903225806452
4521991,3,B0051GLDQI,"I'm 9 months pregnant and have been sedentary for the duration (and have gained much more than the recommended amount) but got this video at 9 months.  I haven't looked at Level 2 or 3, but have been doing level 1 without issue.  There are some moves I skip, like jumping in place, high knees and planks, but I swap those exercises with some of the other exercises in the video or just do upper body workouts with light weights. There aren't too many of those I have to skip and I do modifications for the side planks, where I instead stay on the ground and on my elbow to do the leg lifts she's doing.  The first level is basically a traditional stability phase of exercise so I would say it should work for anyone who has been sedentary and is just starting out.  Not too much cardio in it so you won't get out of breath at all (I never did but I did skip the jumping in place warm-up and I can't go all out when doing the moves like I might if I weren't 9 months pregnant).  I can't speak for the other levels as I haven't watched those yet.

With regard to her comments, I actually don't mind them for the level I watched.  I have other Jillian videos and I get so sick of hearing it and seeing the stupid background people's comments and facial expressions, it is irritating. But this video actually hasn't bothered me yet.  What I did appreciate is that one of the girls that Jillian favors actually gives Jillian some backtalk and ""talk to the hand"" gestures and actually pushes her away a couple times. It's all in good humor but I think it lessons how irritated I might otherwise get at being repeatedly subjected to the same banter. Jillian's attitude is definitely happier in this video so far so that is a nice change. And I appreciated that she only does 2 sets per circuit. In other videos of hers she does 3 sets and I get extremely bored.

One thing I didn't like was that there is background music with a beat, but I don't think even one exercise is executed to the beat of the music. I also didn't see an option to have music-only, so you'd have to mute it and find your own music - but then she's not doing anything to any rhythm so you'd be doing your own number of reps to your own beat.

Overall, I prefer her other videos to this one because they are a better workout for me, with more cardio and more weights and follows the beat of the music, so I probably wouldn't ever do level 1 of this video if I weren't compromised by being pregnant.  Again, my disclaimer here is that I did have to substitute some of her moves (mostly with others from her level 1) that I just couldn't physically do with a giant belly.",1427673600,,2635,4.229083665338646

4522006,5,B0051GLDQI,"I am a long distance runner. When I strength train, I focus mainly on my core and legs. I own 30 Day Shred (completed it 4 times with better results each time), No More Trouble Zones, Burn Fat Boost Metabolism, 6 Week 6 Pack, and Killer Buns and Thighs. I cannot say enough good things about all of the videos I own. I never get bored with Jillian, even though I can repeat exactly what Jillian says in the videos I've done them so many times. I do 6 Week 6 Pack twice a week and this time around in my training program I've thrown in Killer Buns and Thighs once a week.

I love Jillian and this workout does not disappoint. If you know Jillian, she's the same in this workout that she is in all of her workouts, or even in the show Biggest Loser. I think it makes her seem real. I like her chatter because it makes me smile (one of my favorite lines of hers from 6W6P is ""I want you to leave this workout visibly smaller"", it motivates me. Another is ""you don't quit when you see the finish line, you RACE for the finish line""- this is often a mantra when I am training for a race, or during the race.) That being said, it makes me sad that people don't like her workout because she's too talkative or the things she says, who cares. A) She's an awesome trainer for me and millions of other people BUT that doesn't mean she's going to be a great trainer for everyone, we each need a different style. B) We should be judging her workouts, if you can't stand what she says, put her on mute, but her workouts have proven results to me.

I have lost 40 pounds and 12 dress sizes in the last 2 years through running and Jillian. I do not pay to go to a gym. I have a flat stomach with a defined six pack and that magical ""V"" that guys say girls can't get. My first mile I ever ran was slower than slow, I have cut minutes off my pace. I am faster and lighter and feel more amazing than I have ever in my life. I am hoping through more consistent use of this video to FINALLY shave off my saddlebags and better tone my booty and thighs. I love the way I look. When Jillian tells me in 6W6P that I'm gonna look amazing, I trusted her, and through hard work and determination and just 30 minutes a day (plus miles and miles of running) I DO look amazing for the first time in my life. What's better yet, is I feel amazing. I highly recommend adding this DVD to your arsenal.

I use her videos after I run, I feel less fatigued if I do my run first and her videos after.

Just an FYI, I started running 2 years ago with Couch-to-5k and did 30DS for 30 days, L1 for 10 days, L2 for 10 days, and L3 for days to kickstart everything. I then progressed to No More Trouble Zones and Burn Fat Boost Metabolism (which goodness! I can run 26.2 miles but this DVD kicks my BUTT!). After that I did 6W6P (5 days a week, L1 for 3 weeks and L2 for 3 weeks). I've now run a marathon and a handful of halfs and 10ks and am training for my second full. So, I do not recommend starting out with this DVD if you are looking to lose weight, or are a beginner. I recommend her 30DS or Ripped in 30 to start, and then go from there.

I look forward to adding her body revolution to my repertoire as well!",1426723200,11,3176,4.018987341772152

4522024,5,B0051GLDQI,"This workout is TOUGH. So far I've only done level one twice and have yet to level up.

I'm a huge JM fan (I own 6 of her workouts), and can honestly say this one leaves me burning like none other. The first time I did this, I was unsure if I was going to make it through. Level one clocks in at a little over 40 minutes, including the warm up and cool down.

I'm 5'5 175 pounds currently, in average shape. I've recently lost about 15 pounds in a little under 2 months. I think this workout would be very challenging and perhaps a little discouraging for an absolute beginner, but there are endless ways to modify the moves and tailor ye workout to ones' own abilities. Natalie and Anita are there to give you some ideas.

The moves in level one are quite diverse, most of which I hadn't seen from Jillian before. Each circuit targets a few specific areas and hammers those muscles HARD. For example she goes from sumo squats right into squat jumps, leaving your quads begging for mercy. The good news is that before you know it, you'll be onto the next circuit, affording those muscles a bit of recovery. She uses the perfect mix of mat work, strength, and cardio that keep things interesting.

Her combination of squats, kicks, inner/outer thigh work, plyometrics, and even a bit of yoga will definitely tone you up. Although I've yet to do levels 2 and 3, I know this DVD was worth my money already.

I'll admit, there is a lot banter in level one (I'm definitely sensing some tension between Jillian and Natalie!). I don't mind it, but some people might find it disruptive. I think it's funny...plus when Jill psychs one of the trainers out, I get to laugh at the girls losing their balance while I mainain focus and form!

I have begun to add this to my current rotation of JM videos: BFBM, NMTZ, and Hard Body. I would also recommend 30DS and Ripped in 30 for anyone who likes 20-30 minute workouts.",1424822400,4,1906,4.400568181818182
4522025,3,B0051GLDQI,"This will go pretty low on my rotation because of the stress many of the moves put on my knees. Level two is particularly punishing, and some of the moves she has you doing don't quite seem safe (I am a former AFAA trained aerobics instructor).The set up is a warm up circuit, and then four interval circuits with the fourth mixing in some mat work. There are cardio intervals sprinkled in throughout each workout, but the whole approximately half hour is cardiovascular because you are using your large muscle groups. I found level 2 particularly challenging and endurance building.",1424822400,4,583,4.84

Some of the moves look very scary and complicated but once you try them and master them, it will make you so proud of yourself! When I first started I would skip some of the scarier moves but eventually convinced myself to try them. I can definitely feel my butt and legs getting toned with these moves. In circuit 3 is where I think I felt my glutes burning the most. I think excluding the warm up there's about 4 circuits? If you've done a Jillian DVD before, it's no different. You do a circuit focusing on one leg and then repeat it moving to the opposite leg. Then you're done and move on to different moves. Some people find this repetitive but it's really not that bad. Each circuit is under 10 minutes. As for her joking and talking during the moves, some people don't like it but eventually you learn to tune it out. I've done her dvds so many times that I have all her little jokes memorized. You can always put some earbuds in!",1424304000,,997,4.225130890052356
4522030,4,B0051GLDQI,"To preface this, I'd consider myself an advanced beginner by Jillian Michaels workout standards. Before I started her workouts in December, I'd been exercising, but not on a consistent basis. I was in ""superficially good shape"" -- meaning, I was already thin, but I was not strong and I sometimes got winded walking up long flights of stairs, that sort of thing. So I decided to try the Beginner 30 Day Shred, which I LOVED, and found to be a great starting point for someone in my situation (it's also great for absolute beginners -- but that's another review). After completing that, I was so happy with how much stronger I felt, how much muscle tone I was seeing, and how energized I was that I wanted to try more of her workouts, so I picked this one up along with a few others.

Overall, this is a fantastic workout that seriously kicks your butt. It's got a nice difficulty level -- even if you're doing the ""beginner"" movements (which, Jillian herself says aren't really ""beginner"" -- it's more like challenging movements vs. the ""advanced"" movements, which are superhuman, haha). Personally, I alternate between the normal movements and the advanced ones, depending on what it is. Obviously we've all got our strengths and weaknesses, and what I love about JM and most of her DVDs is that she takes this into account and gives you simple ways to increase/decrease difficulty based on your fitness level.

The only reason I'm giving this a 4/5 instead of 5/5 is that I'm not super fond of the way the workout is broken up. In all of the other JM DVDs I've tried, it's been broken up like this: Warmup, Circuit 1 (x2), Circuit 2 (x2), Circuit 3 (x2), Cool Down. But in this one, she has you do the warmup twice, which makes it feel like it's a circuit, not a warmup. I'm there's a reason for this that isn't immediately obvious to a non-fitness expert, but it was a little strange and caught me off guard. I can get over it, though. There are also four circuits (five, if you count the warmup), which isn't a huge deal -- I'm just partial to three-circuit workouts. But what really threw me off was that during level one, there are a few times she says this workout is ""less than 30 minutes."" It's actually 43 minutes (I checked level 2 and 3, and they're also 43 minutes each). I thought maybe she meant the workout itself (so, minus the double warmup and cool down), but even if you take those out, it's still more than 30 minutes. I was really hoping for something around 30 minutes total because I'm short on time in the morning, but again, it's something I can deal with. I just have to get up a little earlier.

All in all, I'm really pleased with this DVD. Can't wait for her new one to come out in a few weeks -- got my preorder in!",1424304000,2,2746,4.433663366336634
4522031,4,B0051GLDQI,"I've only done level 1 , 3 times so far. And I didn't last more than 15 minutes each time =( I never really exercised before, so this really killed me. First day I was laying on the floor after 15 minutes thinking how am I going to go downstairs, my legs were shaking so much I couldn't get up lol So thats the good part. It works your muscles very well. 2 minor complains, though I understand she talks a lot to keep us distracted from focusing on pain , it did get a little annoying after a while, so I just turned off the volume and put on some trance house music. Next , I felt like there is not that much variety in exercises. We did 3-4 different types and start over doing the same thing...idk maybe there is a reason for that , that Im not aware of, but it is what it is...Anyway, Im giving it 4 stars, overall its a good DVD.",1424217600,,834,3.9702380952380953

I have never had a weight problem, I got these just because I need to be exercising since I am now in my late 30s and my body is telling me it's time. I am now a Jillian Micheals fan. Her workouts keep me interested and motivated. Just when I start to think I want to cheat she reminds me it's a short workout and you gotta work to get results. Next thing I know its cool down time.

ANYWAYS, the workouts are really phenomenally difficult on this work out.  I do it about four days a week and for the first three weeks, I had a PERMANENTLY sore butt.  I've only been at it for three weeks, but I can see a huge difference in myself.  I can actually FLEX my butt.  I will say I have noticed more of a difference in my butt than in my thighs, but then again, I am not advanced enough to go all in on every work out.  I have done all three levels and there are just some moves my wimpy arms can't handle (like the ones in level one where you have to support yourself with just one arm, yeeeesh!)  I will say, if you modify, level three can seem really pretty easy, but it's also possible I may not be doing all the moves 100% correct.  Jillian is upbeat and motivating--and there were a few times I literally had to stop the DVD because she had me laughing so hard.  Anita and Natalie seem a lot less stuck up than in 30 Day Shred--especially Anita (my friends and I used to laugh about the death glares Anita gave Jillian in Shred).  It's a great work out, has me pouring sweat every time I do it!  Can't wait to see more results!",1416787200,12,1501,4.116838487972508

wow! this is AWESOME - she really ""burns it out"" - my thighs feel amazing and I totally love the hamstring/glute stuff!! It goes quick and each workout is different and challenges you in a diff way.

Each workout (there are 3) is about 30-35 minutes long - perfect!
Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3.

Honestly, Level 1 - if you add hand weights and do the 'advanced' versions of the exercises is still DIFFICULT!!!

I love that she shows you a modifier on EVERY move - I can't do all the plyo stuff so she shows you how to still work hard and not bang up your knees on every workout.

She's funny and always talking. The girls working out with her are SOOOO motivating to look at - shredded but not super skinny stick figure models - REAL girls who work hard to look FANTASTIC!",1413331200,2,795,4.176470588235294

4522085,5,B0051GLDQI,"I have been a big fan of Jillian and her at-home workout routines, ever since I picked up 30 Day Shred and began my healthier-me journey.  I credit her tough-love approach to getting me off the couch and moving.  Like I mentioned, I am a big fan of the 30 Day Shred DVD, and I am also currently using the Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism as well as the No More Trouble Zones.  I knew that I needed something that concentrated more in the lower region of my body, because my legs and hips weren't where I wanted them to be.  I should have known that Jillian would come through for me.

The first level of this DVD I didn't find especially challenging, because I was already rotating some of her other workout routines.  I did feel the tightness in my quads and calves, but nothing especially grueling.  That all changed once I hit Level 2.  This DVD contains three levels progressing in challenge until Level 3 and its one-legged mountain climbers of doom.  Even now I sometimes still collapse on those.

I started noticing an improvement my second day after hitting Level 2.  My whole overall lower body, from ankles to hips is tighter, and like the title mentions, my buns are killer!  I have never had such good definition before, and I am absolutely in love with the results.  Some of the moves you will recognize if you are a Jillian fan.  That doesn't mean that they are any easier to do!  One of the moves is a squat into a roundhouse kick (Level 3), which, if you do BFBM like I do, you may feel relived to see because you were doing roundhouse kicks on your first circuit in BFBM.  Wrong.  There is no relief.  I could barely lift my leg into a kick because the combination of moves really puts you through the wringer.  In a good way!  Jillian even mentions that it's not always the moves themselves, but the combination that you are doing them in.

I'll say it again, this DVD did exactly what I was expecting it to do, and I love the results that I am seeing.  I will continue with this routine, and because it's only about 30 minutes (40 in total with the warm-up and cool-down routines) I can work it quite easily into my week, and as a supplement to any other workout I'm currently doing.  I would definitely recommend this workout routine to people of all fitness levels.  Just because you may already been working out and ""in shape"" (like I considered myself to be) doesn't mean you won't feel the burn on this one.  Keep in mind, you will need hand weights (light and heavy) and a chair for this workout routine (and I highly recommend an exercise mat, especially if you have hardwood floors).",1412985600,11,2606,4.412997903563942

The circuits make it easy to keep track of time, and the exercises are very well demonstrated. Each workout runs approximately 30 minutes with the warm ups. I always ""feel the burn"" after sweating it out with Jillian!",1412812800,,334,4.491803278688525
4522088,5,B0051GLDQI,"I am by no means a pro athelete. I am restarting my fitness journey after having three surgeries (non knee related) in 18months. I have a personal trainer that I can only afford to see once a week. I am incorporating Jillian's DVDs on the other days. I've only done it four times since I got it last week and I already feel results.

I agree with previous posters. Level two is serious business! OMG! I feel it today :) I love a workout that leaves me dripping sweat and achy the next day. Level one was a good sweat, but no soreness the next day. Jillian being angry with the tweeters who called her workouts easy is mostly in the level one workout. She mentions it 3 times.

As with all home workouts, if it hurts, STOP! Modify moves to suit your body. There are parts in this DVD that would strain my joints beyond what I find acceptable. No high impact for me. My Dr ok'd this so long as I don't do anything that stains my joints. I opt for other things that work my muscles and keep moving.

I'm currently looking into more of her DVDs. I prefer workouts that incorporates weights rather than simple Cardio. Also 30-40 minutes are easier to contemplate on a regular basis than workouts that require one hr or longer.",1412640000,3,1221,4.323144104803493

4522100,5,B0051GLDQI,"This is an awesome DVD, and it deserves 10 stars. First of all pros and cons:
The Pros:
- literally one of the most challenging workout DVD's I've ever done (love nmtZ, bfbm, ripped in 30, kickbox fast fix, insanity, and p90x)
-it will give you a great round, firm butt, and Carrie underwood thighs
The Cons:
-it's really damn hard
-if you don't already have VERY strong legs you're going to be in rough shape for days.

So I've done this DVD, mixed in with other JM videos and tri-weekly 7 mile runs. I am in excellent shape. This workout took me to a different level and gave me a 'grade A' 5 star rearend. (Thankyou Jillian!) As some negative reviewers said, 'this workout won't give you a butt like nicki Minaj or Kim kardashian' ummmmm, no workout will give you that because that is genetic and those are fat deposits (or surgical enhancements) not muscle. And news flash: Kim k isn't in shape! And I was really annoyed when someone said this would give you an ass like Jennifer aniston or Miley Cyrus. No, and no. My measurements are 35-24-40, 5'2, and 129 lbs so I'm hardly in that category, although I'd love to look Jen!

This workout is amazing. I have a great butt thanks to jillian. If you want a curvy round butt you will get it, just don't expect to do it twice and then look like JLo. Consistency is key and Jillian's workout are great for tightening and toning everything up. If you were genetically blessed (or cursed depending on your personal taste) with a petite frame and a small butt, no you're not going to end up looking like Maliah Michel, but this will sculpt you, tone you, and lift your booty into amazing ass land. Great butts can come in any size, so use Jillian's workout and work that thang!",1410566400,10,1723,4.415094339622642

4522105,5,B0051GLDQI,"Oh Jillian. I was leery to buy this given that I don't really enjoy Jillian on Biggest Loser, but I actually love her on this DVD! She has some corny lines during the workout, but she isn't screaming, and I feel like it's a great workout. I like that it includes levels based on difficulty, so you can start on Level 1 and work your way up (or do Level 1 on a day when you're not feeling 100% committed). I like the backup instructors, who are seriously strong and healthy. I chose this DVD based on the fact that the workouts are shorter than usual, since I get bored easily and am more likely to do the workout that is 30 minutes versus getting overwhelmed with the prospect of an hour. Jillian is actually very encouraging, and I think she gets a bad rap on Biggest Loser. She does most of the workout, and I like how she alternates between high and low intensity. Probably my favorite Jillian Michaels workout DVD!",1409529600,2,918,4.343023255813954

4522107,1,B0051GLDQI,"I'm soooo freakin disgusted with this DVD that I just abruptly stopped this mess of a video to come here to vent and release my frustration by rating it on Amazon (as opposed to throwing it against my wall!) for you today :-(  !!!!
I bought this DVD due to the high ratings it received and because I did enjoy Jillian's ""No More Trouble Zones"" DVD.  Due to the fact that I spent my hard earned money on this one, I have tried adnauseum to like it or at least get into it, but I just cannot do it! With such a high rating, I thought it must be me, but after trying it for the last time, I think NOT! Now I remember why it's one of the few exercise videos that's been sitting here on the floor over a year gathering dust....  It's like torture trying to get through it. Not because I'm not into a good hard workout, but because it's harmful to your knees (even with the most proper technique) and this woman is just sooo obnoxious in this workout video. First off, if you want an ass like Jennifer Anniston or Miley Cirus then go ahead and buy this, but just be prepared to have bad knees if you do it too much; However if you want an ass similar to Nicki Manaj or Kim Kardashian, this workout will definitely not get you that because it's not enough weight resistance. Just a bunch of hoping around up and down side to side crap, gyrating, unnecessary jumping up and down, knee knocking, joint stressing BS. Jillian is a powerhouse from a media prospective so I believe people are more drawn to her celebrity-ism than the true quality of what it means to have a good effective workout that will enhance the intended body part(s) that it claims to workout. People who have rated this DVD high obviously don't know how to get a good ass workout to the point where an apple will sit on your ass cause it's so perky and high. Oh and did I say  Jillian is so freak'in annoying? Also, she gives no real example before actually starting the set of each exercise. She and her crew just jumps right into it causing you to have to constantly rewind to get the knee busting moves right.  In all honesty, I probably can get past her obnoxious persona by putting on my earphones and just watching the DVD, but only if this were a good workout. It's just not though. Faithfully, I've been working out for over 15 years and I understand that you do have to use your knees in any glute exercise for it to be effective (which is why I have a great ass and I'm trying to keep it that way, but i digress...), but there is a proper way to do it without damaging your knees from the harsh beating they will take if you perform the exercises in these routines. Then to top it off, these exercises will not do anything to give you a nice shapely ass. It's just exercise for the sake of jumping around. In fairness to Jillian, I suppose she should get one star for the cardio part of this routine, which results from you jumping around so much. After this crap, I will just mainly stick to my leg press, squats, dead lifts, etc. I will say that I have enjoyed Tamilee Webb's ""I want those buns"" DVD. It's an oldie, but goodie! By adding extra weights (if you are a mid to advance level exerciser), it's really an effective workout and she is a class act and a professional at what she does. Maybe class is no longer a requirement for so called ""fitness gurus"" of today. The only issue with Tamilee's video is that I've worn it out because it's so good. My body has gotten used to it so today I needed to switch up my routine so I thought I'd try this Jillian crap, but what a waste of my precious energy.  If you are a real and true exercise connoisseur, do not be lulled into getting this DVD just because it has Jillian Michaels featured as the brand. You'll be sorry. Her name on this DVD is not worth its weight at all (pun intended). Try to see if you can view it on Youtube or borrow it from the library beforing buying it (which is what I usually do and should have done. Maybe I wouldn't be so irritated right now). If you go against the few descenting opinions here, and you do decide to buy this DVD, just be prepared to get to know a good orthopedic doctor cause you'll need one for your soon to be  messed up knees. And if you do have challenges with your knees, your knees will get even worse due to the hellava beating they will take from this knee pounding piece of mess of a a DVD.  What a waste of time, energy and my money:-(  ... If I can help just one person in their decision of whether or not to buy this junk, then my suffering today would not be in vain.",1409529600,13,4553,4.188356164383562
4522108,5,B0051GLDQI,"I highly recommend Level 2 for a great Leg Day workout. I recommend it over any lower-body exercise in T25 or P90X3.

I thought the buns and thighs would be better, thinking the focus would be on the lower body. I should have known better since her workouts use all parts of the body, but it wasn't great to do with my injury. I did what I could on level 1 but there were a lot of sequences I had to skip over. What I was able to do was great and I still felt it the next day which is always a good sign of a good workout in my opinion. Once I'm feeling better, I think I'll enjoy this more. Also, a lot of the reviews said Jillian is annoying in this video and they are all correct.

This killer buns & thighs DVD targets all those butt muscles I never knew I had.  Honestly, I've never felt so strong and healthy before in my life, (and I've had 2 kids by the age of 30).
I can feel a difference and I've only done Level 1 twice on this DVD. Thank you Jillian for once again delivering a sweat-drenched-effective workout all in the convenience of my living room while my kids are napping!",1406592000,2,572,4.336448598130841

It's definitely NOT a typical girly 30 min exercise video (which I didn't want!). It kicks. your. ASS :) (pun intended). I like that the women in the video look like athletes versus skinny little runway models. Also, sometimes they mess up or get tired during the video (granted, they're doing 100 takes, but still...), which makes it feel more like you're working out alongside real people! My quads and glutes have never been so sore (and I've only tried workout #2 so far!). This video is LEGIT. Definitely worth the money.",1406505600,4,635,4.72972972972973

4522134,5,B0051GLDQI,"My background: I'm not a beginner, nor am I new to jillian workouts. I've mastered several of her DVDs, including the popular 30 Day Shred & Ripped in 30.

I've done level 1 of this DVD twice, and I've previewed levels 2 & 3. This DVD is KILLER.  The 2 times I've done level 1, I made the mistake of not wiping off my make up first; my face was dripping with sweat like crazy!!  Even though the title says ""Killer Buns & Thighs"", you will actually get a full body workout (which is what I love about all JM DVDs).  Level 1 really works the core & arms too, because of all the planks.

I exercise almost everyday using mostly JM DVDs, and I STILL found level 1 to be crazily intense! I truly wouldn't recommend this DVD to absolute beginners. Jillian jokingly says so herself during the cool down that her level 1 is not really a ""level 1"" workout.

I love Jillian's personality in this one & I love how she jokes around with Natalie & Anita; it makes it more fun. Some reviewers complained about how Jillian complains about negative feedback & comments on Facebook / twitter.  Well, it is true that she mentions how much it pisses her off, but it's not like she's doing a whole segment about it!! And I personally didn't find that to be distracting or unprofessional; she is telling you how to make the workouts more challenging if you find them too easy.

To each their own, but I personally love this DVD & I love her style & personality. I am looking into purchasing her book, Slim For Life...because I am becoming very addicted to Jillian!!",1406073600,10,1544,4.355400696864112

4522139,4,B0051GLDQI,"I have been exercising regularly for well over a decade, and I find the butt a challenging area to tone... Most exercise videos are too mild to really feel the burn.  I mean that BUURN you feel after the 1st time you do it you're walking funny the next day, and shaking right after you finish.  I did workout 3 twice once in the AM & once in the PM and I do feel the lower part of my butt...but it's about a 5 1/2-6 on a scale of 1-10 1 being pure fluff and 10 being that BUURN I spoke of before.  There's plenty of cardio...high impact stuff like plyometrics and that's great... but I wanted the workout to be focused on the butt more with longer reps.  It's not a waste of money (for me) the plyometrics (sp?) really works the fast twitch muscles of the lower body.  In addition to feeling it in the butt, my abductors, adductors, hip flexors, hamstrings, & lower back are mildly but pleantly sore.  Everytime I walk up stairs I am reminded that I did get an effective workout however... I WANT MORE!!!
For more of a challenge, I recomend Ballet Beautiful with Mary Helen Bowers.  I can't remember the exact name of the video, but it's all about the butt and extremely effective.  It's a completely different workout done entirely on the floor... it's 4- 15 min. workouts you can customize.  She really fatigues those lower muscles, because she dosen't stop working one side until she's completely done with that side then on to the other.  The workout options are :
1) Butt Series # 1
2) Butt Series # 2 (my favorite)
3) Swan Arms (this one's eh I recommend light weights)
4) Ballet Blast",1404691200,,1591,4.36271186440678

4522145,3,B0051GLDQI,"I've used the dvd twice now; the first time I did the beginner level and the second time I did the middle level.  There are 3 videos/intensities. The workouts are challenging, so no real complaint there and she tells you how you can make them harder (along with complaining to us about how we better not complain on facebook that the workout isn't hard enough because she hates seeing those posts---its our fault if we don't like the video she says, add more weights!)  Compared to other videos I've done, these workouts just aren't that enjoyable for me.  I think a large part of that has to do with Jillian as the instructor; I'm just not a huge fan of her personality and I felt that she spends way too much time in the video goofing off with the 2 girls that are performing the workouts.  She is clearly friends (especially with the one girl) off-screen and while that is not a problem, she spends too much time joking around with her.  It just doesn't come across as professional and I don't feel very motivated by her.",1403827200,2,1024,4.454545454545454

Devastating to me since I have always been in great shape but honestly the running without weights and target training just wasn't cutting it anymore.  I was doing Gunnar Peterson's Bun Battle regularly but no real change.
I started Level 1 and it seriously kicked my butt.  Sweating, burning, wanting to quit, but going on anyway.  I was so sore the next day it was scary but I did it the next day too.  For the next 2 weeks I did Level 1 3-4 times per week.  Now I am at level 2 and have been for the last week.  I am definitely getting stronger because Level 2 is challenging but I don't feel like I did when I started level 1.  This tells me its working!
I honestly love it and I am so glad I bought it.  My clothes fit loser and my legs (even the front) have barely any cellulite after only 3 weeks of doing this DVD.",1403049600,13,938,3.9732620320855614

4522149,5,B0051GLDQI,"Ok, so this is my first time writing a review for a product even though I've read hundreds of them.  However, I felt compelled to write one for Killer Buns and Thighs and to rate it 5 stars.  I've been running for about 4 years now and slowly building up my mileage and ran my first 10-K in April.  My next goal was to complete a local half marathon this November.  Well, not sure if it was the increase in mileage too quickly or the extra pounds I gained over the winter but I started experiencing awful calf pain every time I ran. I got to where I couldn't run half a mile without stopping 2-3 times.  If you're a runner you will now how discouraging and disappointing this is. I tried everything I could think of, ice packs, foam roller, calf sleeves, meds, but nothing was helping.  Just when I was about to give up, my wonderful husband-to-be, suggested I try a workout video to help strengthen but butt muscles to see if it would help.  I figured why not since I tried all I could think of.  So we found Jillian Michael's, Killer Buns and Thighs and of course I was very skeptical but bought it anyway.  The first day I did I thought I was going to die.  I was on the floor gasping for breath in a pool of sweat.  WOW, this was harder than anything I had every done and that includes running!!  But I didn't want to give up so I kept at it.  That was 2 weeks ago and only doing Level 1.  Well, yesterday I decided I give running a try to see if things had improved but VERY skeptical.  To my disbelief, I ran 2 miles without pain!!  I felt so good and strong I could have ran for 10 miles but I didn't want to push it.  But I did it without having to stop to stretch or slow down or want to cry from pain.  I'm sorry this is so long but I just can't impress how happy I am that I can run again.  If you are a runner, please, please consider doing this workout, you won't regret it.  Even though the scale hasn't gone down, I've definitely noticed a change in my butt, thighs and stomach.  I'm going to start Level 2 today but I'm no longer dreading it but looking forward to the challenge.

4522151,4,B0051GLDQI,Very difficult work out again from Jillian but that's kind of what you have to expect.  I have tried level 1 so far but trying to master that before I move forward.

Good thing because I was pretty much unable to walk for 3 days after due to how sore I was. This dvd will kick your butt, which was just what I wanted! I personally can't stand Jillian Michaels* so after I've done her workouts a few times and feel confident enough, I mute her and listen to my own music while I follow the DVD.

Unfortunately, I was so incredibly sore from doing it, I have not been inclined to do it again.  Please do not misunderstand me.  I love to exercise, walking, yoga and moving my body.  However, I am not interested in hurting myself.  I will likely stick to walking and yoga.  I think Jillian knows her stuff and have no doubt that this DVD will provide results, provided that you have both the physical ability to do this and more than basic knowledge about form.

4522167,4,B0051GLDQI,"The workout itself is great - as most women know, thighs and butt are parts of the body that are hardest to tone up. Jillian doesn't disappoint on this part of it. I've only done level one and two so far... I got it because I am a long distance runner and noticed that my legs could use some muscle lengthening in them and to also strength train to help my endurance while running. It is a good workout to get you winded and I do get somewhat sore the next day with it. It is like most of her other workout DVDs - she does circuit training and includes cardio to keep your heart rate up. Her style has proved to work for so many, and I feel others will see the benefits of it.

My one gripe on this DVD (which is why it's rated 4 instead of  stars) - She does a lot more talking in this DVD than others I have done. We all know how Jillian is - she always has inspirational things to say and does talk a lot throughout the workout to keep you going, however, in this one, it doesn't seem like her. She talks about critics on her Twitter and Facebook and how it ""pisses her off"" when people make comments. Of course, that's gotta be hard to read, but she's a professional and she's famous - it comes with the territory. The best way to shut up harsh critics is to keep plugging away and do what you do best. She has the freedom to say what she wants, but to me, it pulled me away from the workout. I was focused and going and then it just took my concentration away. Some might not be bothered by this, but I like an instructor that is busy counting reps and inspiring so I know how to pace myself for the particular move I'm doing. She usually does this.

All in all, it's a great workout. I can't wait to start level three and see how tough it will be. I look forward to the soreness!",1396051200,2,1785,4.022535211267606

Since this is a 30 min workout(per level) (not her 1 hr videos) I combo'd this w/ the 6 week abs and I got one heck of a workout. I will say this, level 1 by itself was rough so if you only have 30 min you will still  get a great workout. There were 2 exercises I really couldn't do yet so I just did more of the others to compensate. For the most part though, all the moves can be done , just perhaps a bit more slowly at first. My only grip w/ JM videos is that she doesn't explain the move first, she just jumps in as if you should know the name of the moves and know what they are about. So, the first time through on her vids I have to just watch her then play catch up when a new moves starts. All and all, a great vid to add to the JM collection.

4522200,5,B0051GLDQI,"Totally agree with all the reviews!!

Please note that this review is not just for ""Jillan Michaels Killer Buns & Thighs"", but for all of her series like the ""6-week, 6-pack,"",""No More Trouble Zones"", ""Burn Fat Boost Metabolism"" etc.

I am in my late twenties and have been working out regularly for about 7 years now.  I am gym person and always thought that workour DVDs are just a marketing gimmic. I was bored with the kind of crunches I had been doing and thought that they were not useful anymore. Like anyone elese these days, I went on to YouTube in search of workout videos. Jillian's 6-week, 6-pack abs caught most of my attention and when I tried them I could really feel the difference . I went ahead and bought the DVD and never regretted! It actually feels like the 30-40 minutes you spend in the workout were really worthwhile.  I loved it so much that I also bought other titles in this series like the one with the 'killer buns and thighs' and 'no more trouble zones'. I hardly ever go to the gym now! I can safely say that Jillian's DVDs are  the most effective form of workout I have ever did. It is truly kick-butt and don't require much equipment.  My body is much toned and I am confident that if I do these regularly, I will get rid of all the trouble areas. I am sure most of us know the types of exercises which Jillian shows. E.g. we all know lunges tone quads and crunches tone abs. The DVDs are more effective because they focus a great deal on form  and the pattern of breathing. Also, the sequence in which Jillia gets these done makes a lot of difference. The camera work actually helps you to learn an exercise , rather than just following it blindly. Plus, Jillian's instructions are totally motivating!

Just a tiny bit of problem that I face is that the circuit training, i.e., doing the sets repeatedly with no break, is not really possible for everyone. I still struggle with some of the exercises.
E.g in her ""No more trouble zones"" DVD, I cannot do the jumps and squats at the same time. But you can easily figure out your own variations in it, i.e you can just do a normal squat and still feel the work done.

One more issue is that in the beginning, one HAS to take a break in the mid of this exercise. But as you work your way up, with time, you get stronger and can do an entire routine in one go.

All in all,I highly recommend this DVD. I am myself going to make sure that I have each and every one of Jillian's workout DVDs.",1390780800,6,2470,4.2924731182795695
4522201,4,B0051GLDQI,This video is pretty good. I have only done level 1 and I don't think I really like Jilliam Michael's style so far but the workout is good.,1390348800,,139,4.0

4522207,3,B0051GLDQI,"The negative comments from Jillian make the workout harder.  I gather she is a professional and has the knowledge of positivity and how it encourages (and actually helps) those that are working to improve.  She isn't very professional in this workout. My goodness, she is famous and is successful on TV and for her DVDs (books?).  Why does she focus on Twitter comments?  The constant interaction with the girl on the left is distracting and not at all helpful.  Watching JM pick on someone doesn't exactly inspire the viewer.  And then she says thing like: ""This is hard...""  I know it's hard and I am working very hard; having somebody say it's hard makes things worse.  I use the DVD, turn off the volume/mute, and turn on my music. If you want this for the workout it's great.  If you are sensitive to verbal comments and distractions, you may want to get another DVD.  Or you can mute it, and keep moving, like I do :-).  You will probably need the instruction at least the first couple of times, of course.  Still, not my favorite for above-mentioned reasons.",1389139200,,1065,4.6063829787234045

They do give you great results, but you have to do them 5-6 times a week. I have been doing J. Michaels DVDs for 4 years now and I won't change them for anything. I like the level (1,2,3) optionality, but usually stick to lever 3. The length of the workout is very appropriate - ~30 min and 10 min of warmup and cooldown.

It is not really for a true beginner. I simply knock off a star because I do not care for the words she chooses to use. But, she is a motivator and encourager. She is definitely good at her job (and she knows it). Each one of her workouts is thorough and will make you sweat. I love the way this DVD is structured with 3 levels about 40 minutes each. Within each are four circuits that repeat two times before moving on to the next circuit. There are not many reps to each drill. There is nice variety. A 10' x 8' area is ideal.",1388448000,3,697,4.057971014492754

4522216,5,B0051GLDQI,"I would highly recommend this DVD. Yes, Jillian rants a fair bit; yes, the ""musical"" soundtrack is less than stellar, but if you stick to the program, you WILL see a difference!
I've done 4 of Jillian's DVDs, and was expecting mostly repeats of moves. I was wrong! So far (Level 1), there are only a few moves that are repeated (high-knees, butt-kicks, side-lunges - in the WARM-UP), but mostly new moves and old ones that have been modified. In the new context, even the repeats are just as hard!

4522255,5,B0051GLDQI,"I consider myself to be in pretty good shape. I run, I lift weights, I do martial arts twice a week. I'm proud of most of my body.
HOWEVER...
My German peasant ancestors gifted me with generous childbearing hips and a butt to go with them. Now, I love having hips; I look fabulous in tight pencil skirts and close-fitting pants. I like having a butt, too. My husband also appriciates the fact that I have a butt.
Now, despite my active lifestyle and reasonable fitness, I carry a bit of cellulite in the butt region. With clothes on, this is not noticable. In a swimsuit or nekkid, however, it is. It's a minor thing, but it bugs me. I don't need to lose any weight; I just want to tone up a little better and maybe help banish the cottage cheese. So when I saw this DVD, I went ""Awesome"" and bought it.
I've never used a Jillian Michaels DVD before. Holy crap. As mentioned before, I work out. I run 3-5 miles six days a week. I take martial arts for an hour and a half twice a week. I lift weights. I can bench press 150 pounds; twenty more than I weigh.
This DVD kicked my ass. My butt and thighs were sore for two days after the first day of the level one routine. I did the more advanced exersizes, but still. Holy crap.
After 2 weeks of using this DVD (I alternate; one day with the DVD, one day without) I can already notice a difference. My leg muscles are more chiseled and...I think...the cellulite is beginning to lose ground! Just a little bit, but still!
Worth every penny. Jillian impressed me. I'll be buying more of her stuff.",1377820800,40,1542,4.2482993197278915

Now the workouts are great, challengind and you feel sore: which is exactly what I'm looking for and needed.
I'm hesitant to press play soon as I don't feel like seeing some kidding around and laughing when working out as it's serious for me and the workouts are not easy.  I guess at one point I'll get used to the workouts and mute the dvd and put my own music.

(in my 50's; lot of miles of those joints!) But she has other exercises in this DVD that are great for those problem areas, and I was able to complete the workout.  It has a lot of muscle stretching moves that feel great for areas that you don't often seem to work on a regular basis.",1376870400,3,546,4.046296296296297

I was 130 pounds, 5'4. Now I am 124 and a half pounds. I love her workouts! I am doing her kickbox routine currently for 10 days. Then I will switch to her Yoga Meltdown video level 1, Banish Fat, and No more trouble zones, doing them 10 days each! I have gotten more toned in my butt and legs. The 6 week 6 pack video toned my stomach a little more than I've ever seen it, but still needs work. I used to be 120 pounds in the past, and in high school I was 145. But my weight goes up and down between 120 to 135. My goal is to reach 115 lbs. with Jillian Michaels hopefully by October.",1375920000,3,760,3.8164556962025316

It will leave you hurting for days.  All of you ladies who want to firm and tighten those ""buns and thighs"" for swim suit season, this is it!  The circuits are fun, challenging and some of them have you sitting there thinking, ""Is she insane??""  It really has a great range of expertise...from beginner, to insanely challenging.  Natalie and Anita from the 30 Day Shred are also in this video!  Overall, it's a great purchase.",1374364800,4,599,4.584905660377358

4522277,5,B0051GLDQI,"Number one and two are great but if you are already in great shape and want to push yourself to another level 3 is the best. Each workout is only 30 minutes so you'd really have to make big excuses to not to have the time to do this at home a few times a week. The intensity of the workout is so great that I think it's all you need even at just 30 minutes. If you want to loose weight probably need to add on another 30 minutes of cardio somehow I'm sure.
 It's interval training. Jillian brings your heart rate up then sends you into deep squats or leg lift type exercises then back into high knee running in place for example. I'm dripping sweat with this! Some of these moves are great and my buns were burning! Glad I bought it!",1373673600,2,733,4.055172413793104

4522280,5,B0051GLDQI,"I used to think workout videos were a joke. Sorry. I admit it. Taebo and a few others changed my mind and so did this one. For me personally no video compares to an hour weight training session or HIIT cardio on a machine or outside. However, there are some good workout videos and then there's this excellent one! :)
It's divided into three workouts that get progressively harder. I did the first two together and I was impressed. Workout one is my favorite because it was just a great workout and I love Jillian. Workout two was good, but there was some choreography with some of the combinations that made me go ""What?"" Lol Maybe after a few more times I'll be more coordinated. I haven't tried workout three yet, but I watched that one and it looks good, too and harder.
I laughed how she kept mentioning people on Facebook saying that the workouts from some other video she made weren't hard enough. During the one workout the poor side girl is out of breath doing some move on the floor and Jillian comes over with a weight and says something along the lines of "" No, no. Let's make it harder. I don't want any crap on Twitter/Facebook."" Hahaha! Love her. :)
The recommendation is to do workout one for a few weeks and then build up to workout two for a few weeks and then do workout three for several weeks. I think if you're a beginner that's probably good. If you're intermediate and up and are able to do a lot of the advanced moves you might just want to alternate each day between the three videos. Whatever works for you. I like variety so that's what I'm doing in between my leg/butt day at the gym.
I love that she explains proper form, too. Not everyone does and it's important so you get a better burn and don't injure yourself.
Remember too that the better you eat and the less processed/junk food and sweets you consume the better you'll look and the faster you'll see results. Healthy diet really reduces the cellulite in some people. I've noticed it with me just by working out hard and eating really good. Resting between workout days is important, too as is lots of water.
Not trying to bore anyone with info. I just wanted to mention it in case somebody was starting out and didn't know. Results are much better when you do all those things right. It takes time, too, so don't get discouraged. Good luck! :)",1372809600,15,2331,4.410672853828307

My only caution is for the ""40 something"" crowd.  Again, I'm an advanced exerciser, but have to modify a few of these exercises to spare my knees.  My knees aren't what they used to be!  But I still get an outstanding workout.  For you 20 and 30 yr olds...  you will love it and likely have no problem.

Its laid out very well with 3 levels and 3 (could be 4 not currently watching at this very moment in time) circuits you repeat for each level. After these workouts my legs feel like jello and I feel more toned in the booty region. She uses the same dancers from 30 Day Shred whom I enjoy watching as Jillian has good chemistry with them.  I rotate a lot of her DVDs so I don't get bored watching one over and over and its a great addition to my rotation.,1372118400,3,516,4.0588235294117645

4522288,5,B0051GLDQI,"I started this workout after doing 30 day shred. I have a post pregnancy body and wanted to get in shape again. Because I work and take care of baby, I was not consistent - 2/3 times per week and I am a vegetarian with no special diet - saw results on my behind and thighs. Maybe if I were more consistent there would be more dramatic results.
Anyway. Level 1 was difficult but doable. Levels 2&3 were difficult. I thought level 2 was the hardest. These exercises are intense and hard on the knees so I needed to rest a lot in between though. My butt is firmer and rounder. I have one now and that is important to me. My legs are a little slimmer and more toned. Looking great in skinny jeans. I lost 5 lbs. not sure i would do it again because of the intensity but we'll see. Doing 6 week 6 pack now.

Trust JM, she knows her stuff.  Whether you like her or not her workouts get results and the price is good.",1371859200,13,910,4.05

4522290,3,B0051GLDQI,"Jillian talks about how great she is through the duration of these workouts. It is very irritating to hear her keep patting herself on the back for being so tough and an ""artiste."" She also has a way of sounding like a playground bully, especially when she's talking to the other two girls working out with her. She calls them ""precious"" and teases them when they can't keep their balance or have trouble with a move. It would be more helpful if she instead counted reps or called out cues. In fact, since she doesn't call out cues, you have to keep your eyes on the screen the whole time anyway, so you might as well mute it.

It seems very unprofessional to me, and I am a bit of a workout DVD junkie. I prefer someone like Karen Voight. She's very professional and gives great cues. She never talks about anything except the moves and how to execute them correctly. Her workouts aren't incredibly hard, but I enjoy them.

As for the ""Killer Buns and Thighs"" claim, the workouts seem more total body than targeted toning. She definitely doesn't do enough hamstring work, but the quad exercises are sufficient. I had a ""Legs of Steel"" VHS in high school that was a great targeted toning workout. I wish someone would put that on a DVD.",1371686400,,1236,4.464601769911504

In just 3 weeks I've noticed significant toning around the buns and thighs plus her workouts have helped my agility and flexibility due to quick moves and engaging many muscles of the body.  I also like that most of her workouts are only 30 minutes which are great in a time crunch and still results oriented...it is a great mix in to my longer cardio routines of cycling and running during the week.  I have really enjoyed my first dive into Jillian's workout series!",1369267200,,693,4.564516129032258

4522306,4,B0051GLDQI,"I was nervous to try this workout after reading the reviews. I have a ""tricky"" hamstring that I injured a few years back and now it seems to pull easily, naturally I want to tone my thighs and glutes and help resolve this issue. I heard from a friend that Julians workouts were awesome so I thought I give her a try. The reviews said it was very difficult, and some of the reviews were from people who say they workout regularly and have for years. Me being some what new to all this I was worried I had made a bad purchase and wouldn't be able to do the exercises or I would get annoyed with Julian. She does talk a lot and I can see where someone may be annoyed, but I just think that's how a lot of trainers talk, I didn't think it was irritating. And I've only done level 1 so far but all the exorcizes I've found are easily modified. And really when you begin something like this you don't have to do as many reps and as fast as the girls in the video, you just do your best and you'll improve each time. I'm very happy with it so far, the only complaint I have is they add a little extra to her booty on the cover LOL but she's in great shape and she's a good motivator.",1369180800,,1176,3.98728813559322
4522307,1,B0051GLDQI,"I came all the way to Venezuela and when i wanted to watch the video it doesnt work. There is no DVD that can read it, so i have to returned it back to the US.",1369180800,,159,3.4444444444444446
4522308,4,B0051GLDQI,"First of all: I'm 20 years old, undergrad student, about 113lbs, 5""3, not in bad shape but not in good shape either. I had never seen a Jillian Michaels DVD before (I have Insanity by Beachbody but let's just say it didn't even remotely work out). I was attracted to Killer Buns and Thighs because those are precisely my problem areas (flab, cellulite, fat) and let's just say being slim is not the same as being fit or toned, so I was really looking forward to this DVD.
You will feel the burn, you will be sore, and most importantly, you will see changes! I finished five days of Level 1 and I feel maybe an eighth of the soreness I felt after the first day. A certain pair of jeans slide on much more smoothly.
Take your time with the levels and the moves, remember the women in the screen do this for a living. Focus on proper form like Jillian says, not on speed.
The length is great! 30 mins, 3 circuits, nice warmup, and a cool-down with stretches (too short I think, but just stretch for a little longer to further reduce next-day soreness).

Cons? Many moves require you to put your body weight on your wrists. I have zero strength in my arms. When it comes to side planks and mountain climbers and some plank combination thing, I simply cannot go through those. I do realize that's my problem and that some people can breeze through those. Also, I'm a fitness newbie so when Jillian calls out the name of the next move I'm totally lost - no stress, just observe, then hit rewind.
 Jillian makes one comment about Facebook, one comment about Twitter. I see how it gets annoying after watching it over and over. I understand that it's unprofessional. However, I don't consider it a big deal.

The bottom line? It's a great workout and I'm very glad I bought it. Pay attention to the moves and not the chatting, go at your pace, hit rewind as needed, take little water breaks, don't hurt or overexert yourself, and most importantly, breathe through it and remember to eat right! You WILL see fast and very, very pleasing results.",1369008000,12,2036,4.453083109919571

I felt my legs and butt start to change and tone up almost immediately and gained strength quickly. I always have a hard time working my butt muscles, but this does it every time.

If you are new to Jillian and not accustomed to doing intensive workouts like this (more than just cardio without any added weight), then I'd recommend doing another Jillian DVD first (like Ripped in 30) in order to build that base level of strength all around. I did get frustrated at first with this DVD because I felt like my legs were strong enough to do the workout but my upper body just wasn't there to support me in planks, burpees, etc.",1368230400,,782,4.3561643835616435

4522326,5,B0051GLDQI,"I wasn't sure how I would feel about this DVD. I bought it several months ago and it was still in its wrapper up until a couple weeks ago. But, now that I have started using it, I am thoroughly enjoying it. There are new moves dispersed throughout as well as some oldie, but goodies. I am also liking the slightly different format consisting of 4 shorter circuits instead of her typical 3. The moves are a mix of cardio (i.e. jumping lunges, one legged burpees - yes, they are just as horrifying as they sound) and toning exercises (i.e. sumo squats, warrior 3, leg raises). While my heart rate is not as elevated as it may be on Ripped in 30 for example, I do break a serious sweat especially on Level 2 (haven't made it to Level 3 yet).

Plus, Natalie and Anita from 30 Day shred are back. Natalie looks amazing, very inspirational. The chemistry between all of them is really lighthearted. While some people have complained about Jillian's comments in this DVD about twitter or whatever, I overall found her attitude to be much more playful and fun than some of the other DVDs. Trust me, she is still tough and I feel the soreness immediately after each workout, but it is a nice change of tone and pace from the other DVDs. I find myself smiling throughout. I do miss some of the upper body exercises and have started compounding some of the moves similar to what you see in her other DVDs to get some additional upper body work in (i.e. sumos squats with tricep dips or bridges with chest fly, etc). But hey, its called buns and thighs for a reason, so that is not a bad thing. All in all, this one is now permanently in my rotation. I highly recommend!

There are 3 levels, each workout is approximately 40 minutes (including warmup and cooldown).",1366416000,,1753,4.424148606811145

4522358,2,B0051GLDQI,"I have several of Jillian's dvds and work out to her videos regularly. She is at her MOST ANNOYING in this video! Constant harping and blabbing, she will not shut up, and it's not nice, encouraging things like in 30 Day Shred where she is telling you to keep going, you can do it, etc. It is all mean and nasty stuff, inappropriate. She is trying to look alternately tough, cute and funny at the same time but it just comes off as egotistical and nasty. I can't stand listening to it, so that is the biggest reason I won't be continuing to use this DVD. It's a good thing I borrowed it from the library and didn't buy it. Her older videos are not as bad, it seems, and her newer ones are like this one. Maybe fame is going to her head.

The workouts themselves also leave something to be desired. I didn't try L1, just L2-3. L2 is not as difficult as I expected. There are a lot of moves where you are going too deep into the squat, which left my knees sore (and I don't have knee problems). In L3, the entire first circuit, and much of subsequent circuits, have you on the floor supporting your upper body on your wrists. It's not as bad as some of her others, but it is too hard for many people's joints, particularly wrists/knees.

Having said all that, the L3 is very hard, so if you are looking for something for your lower body that is pretty intense, it is decent. I do like her use of plyometrics and think they are very effective. But I'm sorry to say that I just can't stand listening to her. I wish there was a voiceover option where you could just hear the cues and not the rest. Then I could turn off the blabbing.

4522364,1,B0051GLDQI,"I didn't make it more than five minutes into this DVD. Not because the moves were too difficult, but because motor-mouth Jillian would not SHUT UP. I can understand the need for commentary, but don't understand the need for endless banter: ""Broadway! Broadway! Yeah, you're looking like a Rockette!"" and ""LeBron James, who you wanna be, you wanna be LeBron James?"" Instead of explaining each move in the circuit first, the would just scream out the name of each particular exercise and then back to the non-stop commentary. It seems that she cares more about letting us know that she's buddies with the two fitness models and being loud and ""cool"" than she is in making a DVD that's easy to follow.

Also, the camera work was ridiculous, flying over Jillian and her two cohorts, twisting, zooming in and out. I don't need the camera locked-off in a static shot, but this is an exercise DVD, not a freakin' rock music video. I need to see what's going on, not be entertained.

I've been doing the 30 Day Shred videos for quite some time now and wanted to switch to something that would target my problem areas. Obviously I haven't seen a difference yet since I just started, but I can already tell it's going to. If you are looking for a video that targets the buns & thighs this video is for you! Level 1 (and the ""beginner"" moves) really burns and can't wait until I can move on to levels 2 and 3! Love Jillian, love this video!",1362528000,3,545,4.102803738317757
4522371,5,B0051GLDQI,"First let me say, I am a huge Jillian fan, but this review is a completely unbiased view of her workouts. I am intermediate to advanced, so maybe beginners will have to take it one step at a time with her work outs. Jillian is the best for getting into shape in the shortest amount of time. Though the levels on the this DVD are slightly longer than 30 day shred or Ripped in 30. If you are looking for a great lower body work out this is the best. The great thing about Jillian's workouts:

1. She combines a bit of cardio, so you get the most out of your workout
2. She incorporates plank work, which means she hits your core
3. And in this DVD, every part of your lower body is targeted, in addition to what I have mentioned above

So its like an awesome 3-in-1 deal your getting.

So why wouldn't you go for it? It's time saving and its efficient. She has you working so hard, that you kind of tune out the talk and just focus. So if you are looking for a solid workout, in this case, a lower body one, then she is the one to turn to. Sure you may not like the way she screams, but does that matter, when you will get fit,toned and the body you always wanted? I have a lot of DVDs but when I am rushing for time in the mornings, I don't think twice about picking up Jillian's DVDs..and when it's 5:30 in the morning, I need someone screaming at me, so I don't fall flat on my face or just give up.",1362441600,5,1401,3.9964285714285714

I've only done level 1 so far, but can get through it with no problems. It is challenging, but do-able. The exercises are great and Jillian keeps it moving at a good pace. The circuits are just right. When I found myself thinking, "" I don't know how much longer I can do this exercise"", it would change and I could move on (AND not get bored). Could do without all the facebook and twitter comments, but other than that, it's a great addition to my other workouts!",1361664000,,616,4.273504273504273

Give me a break, that sounds ridiculous. I didn't mind the banter and seeing a couple of bloopers made me feel better about myself maybe not doing every thing perfectly!

This DVD will work your lower body out. It is hard. Level one (and she gives you a beginner and hard girl to watch to meet your level) is tough. If you are extremely out of shape, you will probably not be able to do level one in one go. (but you have to start somewhere, right?)

Started w/ the level 1, obviously, which had a good mix of basics and more advanced, harder exercises, with options to add/decrease difficulty in them. This really is a buns & thighs video, with a little bit of lower leg, and also some core (mostly due to assocation to said buns). I mixed this workout I was already doing, and was a little sore after initially doing it. My mother did it with me one day (she usually just walks for exercise), and she said she really felt it the next day, so I would say it really works for beginners. I really like the mix of large movements, pulsing movements, isometrics, and balances to vary it up and give different areas of the body rest, etc. Overall decent video to add to the mix for those that are regular exercises, and very good for beginners looking for a nice challenge.",1361059200,,857,4.464968152866242

4522388,5,B0051GLDQI,"I coasted through my early to mid twenties with virtually no exercise. Having a good metabolism meant I stayed slim, so I thought I was doing alright. Back then, I mistakenly thought that working out was for people who needed to lose weight or for fitness fanatics..

Well, I was very wrong. When I went to the doctor for a yearly check up and found out my cholesterol was high, I decided to pick up a couple work out DVDs to get in shape.

I started with Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred and I can't recommend that DVD enough. After working my way through level one and two, I decided to pick up another DVD to alternate with Shred. I chose Killer Buns and Thighs, and it is glorious.

Now on level two after two weeks of level one, I can say that I'm getting results from this and Shred. My thighs and bum are firmer but more importantly, I feel healthier. I have more energy during the day and sleep better at night after an afternoon of working out.

For those who are beginners like me, don't get intimidated by Jillian Michaels. She explains the exercises really well. If you're new to Jillian or to exercise DVDs in general, start out with 30 Day Shred and supplement your weekly regimen with workouts like Killer Buns that target your problem areas.

By the way - level two is hard but really fun. Single leg burpees, reverse squats, lateral jumps (lots of jumping, actually). And the ladies do a great job of making you feel like you're there, toughing it out with them. Jillian has her own style of no-nonsense encouragement. It's refreshing and it works. There is this excellent positive energy around level two that makes me get into it every time. Now I can't wait to work my way towards level three.

In nearly two months of working out 4-5 days a week with Shred and Killer Buns, I have lowered my BMI, significantly toned down my shoulders, abs, thighs, and bum, and lost an inch around my waist (something I wasn't even aiming for). I'm going to hit the doctor in a month or so to check out my cholesterol, but after all this work and a couple diet changes (less meat, more grains and greens) I'm sure to have better results than before.

I was really having a difficult time finding the right fitness regimen until I found Jillian's programs. I've heard they're based on military training, where you're constantly mixing a weight-bearing move with a cardio move. Sounds practical.

 Regardless, this was the key that opened a new door to fitness for me; I had been bored with straight pilates. Plus I enjoy her screaming and yelling and tough talk. If I get bored of it, I mute her voice and turn on the dance mixes. This was her hardest video for the lower body yet, and I'm counting Extreme Shed & Shred, which made me lay on the floor and actually cry a few tears, LOL!  (my first video).

I'll definitely keep ordering the new ones as they come out. I don't care if they mix in some old moves with the new ones. It's always a brand new routine, and I come out COMPLETELY HURTIN' EXHAUSTED with each new DVD it takes me a few months to catch up. Totally worth it!

I should mention that I'm fairly out of shape, and most of my life I haven't been disciplined to work out. Also should mention that I have tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis) from computer mouse overuse, and have had this injury for 7 years.

Because this video is called Killer Buns and Thighs, I had no idea that on about half the workouts, you will have to support your weight on your hands. I think for that alone, there are whole circuits I won't be able to do without risking further injury. I have weak hands/wrists because of my issues, so I really struggled with many of the moves. I just wasn't expecting them.

Second, I could not get through this whole video in one sitting-- not just because of my wrist issues but because it's damn hard!  I had to stop at the 17-minute mark and take a break.

Although I like Jillian very much as a likeable and no-nonsense instructor, I can only conclude two things-- this video is probably NOT for beginners (luckily she DOES have a beginner set of workout vids, which I just bought and will try next). And two, if you have tennis elbow and are still healing, you may be taking a significant injury risk doing this workout.  I'm thinking, sadly, that I may have to put this one away for awhile. If only they made videos for sufferers of tennis elbow who would like a good booty workout. :(",1357516800,5,1602,4.34113712374582

I still  haven't got to level 3 but I love this work out. I did have a problem tough it does not workbin all dvd players .  So I have to use it on my laptop or blue ray.

4522451,5,B0051GLDQI,"This workout is great for those who want results fast. It is not the easiest workout but you will definitely see great improvement in less time. The first couple of days you might think: this is too hard, I can't do it. But if you stick to it, you'll get better and better and it will get easy, then you move to the next level. I love that Jullian made three different levels of workout so that you're always in the learning zone and you push yourself harder. As you get familiar to the workout it's more and more fun.

4522456,5,B0051GLDQI,I bought this DVD hoping to add to my workout collection. I've purchased a DVD of Jillian's in the past that was an intense aerobic workout but I also wanted an anaerobic routine-more of a muscle building routine. This is definitely a DVD that achieves that. I see results very quickly and still feel the impact from the workout for days after I've exercised.,1355270400,,359,4.625
4522467,5,B0051GLDQI,"I love the different levels of workouts and the challenge/intensity that Jillian always gives.  This video has all the basic moves and some new ones... love it and as always she keeps things interesting.  There are some moves that I've had to modify though because even at 28, they just didn't 'feel right' on my knees so I wanted to avoid injury which I thought may happen if I tried to do them and keep up with the pace.

Now if I could just convince myself to do them more often...",1355184000,3,484,4.2967032967032965
4522468,5,B0051GLDQI,"KBKT is awesome.  I really felt like this toned up my legs with a great combo of cardio, yoga and strength.  Jillian does a good job keeping the workout moving.  The warm ups get your muscles and heart pumping, and each circuit uses a good variety of moves.

I'm surprised that people do not find it challenging.  I think there are some easy ways to make the video harder if you feel you need to. For starters, there are a few ""breaks"" where Jillian is hyping the next move or transitioning with the girls. Once you know the DVD, you can keep exercising for a few more seconds to pick up some extra reps and push yourself harder.  Like Jillian says, you can always up the weights. I used weights on a few exercises where she did not have them on the girls (including bionic woman/running man in level 2) which helped. Also, this is virtually ALL difficult with 8lb weights.",1354838400,2,873,4.391304347826087

4522470,5,B0051GLDQI,"My biggest trouble area is the whole stomach, hips, and thigh area.  Workout one starts at all those basics that you know help (old school mat work) and staying on that for a couple of weeks is recommended before advancing to level 2 and 3.  You will need a chair for those levels and oh does it hurt! With that said, I am getting a good workout focusing on my problem area and as much as I love all her DVD's, and I do all of her workouts, I love this one for the focus.  I used to do those Buns of ""you know what"" workouts back in the 90's and this is 10 times better and you're getting your cardio in as well.",1354752000,3,612,3.9193548387096775

4522476,3,B0051GLDQI,"I am impressed with the intensity and targeting of this workout. No doubt - by keeping up with it, it will continue to do exactly as she promises.... However, if you are one who likes transitional time and cues between moves, and ""form coaching"" i'd skip this one and go straight for P90x. Everything about the transition and coaching is better.  I've heard her other DVDs are better for that, so I'm a bit sorry this is my first one.

The other downside is as others have said. This is not a motivational workout...she definitely seems a bit jaded here. Most of the way through the workout I wish I could tell her to ""leave it on the field, sweetheart!"" when she complains about twitter etc.

All that said - I commend Michaels on a tough workout, and one that I will continue - because all in all its what we make of it, right?",1354147200,,829,4.335483870967742

She is amazing.",1350432000,,351,4.242424242424242
4522484,5,B0051GLDQI,"prior to purchase this dvd, I had been working out with Jillian's BFBM for up to 5 times a week (For 2 years) and even tho I lost weight with it, I was still not happy with my flappy butt and thunder thighs. After I saw many reviews on this DVD, I purchased it in Feb and have been working out with this DVD for 2-3 times a week. I  did notice my butt is firmer and the thighs are slimmer after 4 months. Now that I have been using this DVD for 8 months, i finally feel confident enough to wear shorts and skinny jeans and I have been getting a lot of compliments from my family on how my legs are so much more toner and look slimmer than ever before!

But don't expect result over night! It takes a lot of hard work to get the result and don't give up on the DVD just because you don;t see result after 1 week! Personally, I still find level 2 and 3 tough and there are days I don't even want to work out just thinking about the moves on the DVD!!!!! But persistent and pushing through it's the only way to go if you want to have killer buns and thighs!!!!",1350432000,13,1057,3.9345794392523366

4522486,4,B0051GLDQI,I love this video-levels 2 and 3 are challenging and give me fast results. The only thing I don't like with the instant video is there's no menu to choose the level you want. You have to fast forward or rewind to get where you want.,1349568000,,232,4.065217391304348

I was always tired and stressed out bc I had to workout on those days or I felt so disgusted with myself and I was busy all the time so I had to always set time for working out for the full 1 hr and then cool down and shower and change. But Jillian is amazing. I just pop in DVD workout for 30 and then I'm done. There is a diet you could go online to do but I've actually gotten better results doing all Jillian tapes instead of the other super expensive ones I mentioned and I'm much happier since it takes so less time.",1349395200,6,609,4.083333333333333
4522489,5,B0051GLDQI,"Usually I don't like workout videos... the hosts, the music, the camera moves.... they're always so cheesy. This one is great because it's Jillian (easy to like her), the production style is simple and not overdone, but most importantly, it's effective! Before doing this program my butt wasn't big but it was lax and the flesh didn't feel too yummy to me when I grabbed it. (I don't grab my own ass much, this was for science) Anyway, after doing this program ONCE the next day my butt felt and looked so much more alive and juicy. Juicy not in a fat way, but in a young-looking way. I've been doing it every other day and even with taking breaks when I'm tired, I'm seeing a steady improvement. I'm really happy with it, thanks Jillian! : )",1348531200,6,742,4.423357664233577
4522490,4,B0051GLDQI,"Jillian Michaels is slightly obnoxious in this DVD because of people evidently saying her workouts aren't difficult enough. That may drive you crazy but that being said the DVD is a really great workout. I've done levels one and two and both are difficult. One thing I will say is that Jillian gives you the name of the exercise but doesn't do ""an example"" to show you how to perform it. For beginners who don't know the exercise lingo it may be hard to keep up. Also, at the end of level one she does stretches but not necessarily for your hips so I always stretch my hips out after the DVD is over. She does throw in a hip/butt stretch at the end of level two which is good. My butt is already perkier (for lack of better word) after a few workouts.",1347926400,3,751,4.222222222222222
4522491,4,B0051GLDQI,"So I had read the two star reviews and a couple of them were talking about knee pain. I have terrible knees, runs in the family. I had knee surgery when I was 19 and never felt I recovered because the knee would dislocate from time to time. I tell my knees whatever, screw you, I am gonna push you and make you strong again. Well I have, I built up my leg muscles so nicely that I finished a Spartan Sprint in Blue Mnt, PA in 2:20 with no pain or injuries, well, soreness for days but that is a given. I owe a lot of this strength to Jillian, I do only her videos plus play soccer. If I ate less I would be in amazing shape but I love to eat yummy food, homemade wine, and good beer, what can I say, life is short people! So, I just did this workout, Level 1 of course, I am not crazy, and felt no pain, not even a tingling in either knee. So please, at least try the video and see how it works for you. I really enjoyed the workout and am dripping sweat. The husband just laughed at how much was dripping from my head. I look forward to getting stronger so I can walk when I am old and still rock a Spartan Race!

Oh and I gave the review 4 stars because for some reason the DVD does not play on the DVD player. It is an old player, that may be why but all my other videos play just fine. I had to do this workout with my laptop.",1346803200,3,1330,3.818840579710145

I find this to be her best DVD yet, and its helping me train for my upcoming (super hilly) 1/2 marathon.  I find level 1 to be good for a rest day, level 3 to be challenging, but do-able, but level 2 consistently kicks my a**.  It is HARD.  Every other Jillian workout I feel like I can master in a few tries.  Level 2?  No dice.  Lotsa plyo.  Its awesome/terrible.  If you have bad knees or can't do high impact work, don't buy this DVD.

If one is bored then we won't be interested in the work-out. So save your money and try anyone else from Callanetics (way old) to Richard Simmons way fun or the classic CIndy Crawford dvds. And especially Adrienne Reed and her different levels of yoga. I believe people just say that they like this video but it has NO long-term staying power like those of other people I have mentioned. This is an awful video even if the exercises work. It doesn't hold my interest at all. AND her babbling on about Twitter/Facebook over and over it not something I want to hear.

I moved on to level 3 tonight and I'm probably going to be pretty sore tomorrow, but right now, I am on an awesome ""fitness high"". I feel great, my lower body muscles are feeling pretty good and I will continue on with level 3 until I get tired of it, but that is going to be some time, I'm sure.

I'm almost through my 9 days at Level 2 and I'm THRILLED with the changes in my rear and thighs!! I've lost a lot of the ""fluff"" around my upper thighs and butt...I never dreamed at age 44 (after years of ""thunder thighs"") that I'd get results like this.  Yesterday, I grabbed a pair of my 16 year-old daughter's jeans by mistake.  Just as I realized I had the wrong pants, my daughter walked in and said,""I can't believe you're wearing my black skinny jeans...but they look great!""  You guessed it, I wore them all day!

This pain continued for 8 days, I iced, took pain relievers, anti-inflammatory's from past injuries, stretched, foam rolled, you name it, I did it. I gave in and went to the doctor and SURPRISE! I tore my LCL! I am annoyed ad in pain beyond belief.

4522503,5,B0051GLDQI,"I'm a huge fan of Jillian's and have yet to be disappointed.  Level 1 is pretty easy, but Level 2 steps it up big time.  I haven't even made it to Level 3 yet!",1343606400,,159,3.6470588235294117
4522504,4,B0051GLDQI,"I am a HUGE fan of Jillian Michaels dvds.  I own all of them with the exception of her latest very expensive set.  I bought this after having my baby wanting a jump start to getting my pre-baby body back.  Well, as usual, Jillian delivers tough exercises!  In my opinion this is one of her hardest workouts she's put out.  She is a bit obnoxious, as she tends to be in most of her dvds, but she does give what she promises.  I VERY challenging and effective workout.  Great addition to the collection.
* The workouts are not 30 minutes though, they are more like 40-45.",1343347200,,569,4.311320754716981
4522505,5,B0051GLDQI,This is one of my favorite Jillian DVDs (I have all except her biggest winner ones). I find it fun and yet it kills! I did her 30 day shred and this was still challenging! Absolutely fantastic!,1343174400,,193,4.243243243243243
4522506,5,B0051GLDQI,"This video is amazing!  Level 2 is HARDER than level 3 in my opinion. Level 3 and level 2 need to switch levels. The 1st week I was sooooo sore, but I kept going! Im a big fan of Jillian but Jillian's voice is annoying as ever, however I will sacrifice listening to her annoying voice all day because this DVD deliver the results!! And at the end of the day, that's all that matters. She no joke but I enjoy how she motivates me to keep going. ""Don't half ass this workout you want results you better show up for me"" "" I wanna see smoke coming out of those buns"" ..it's crazy, but when she says this during the workout for some reason I get amped.

My butt and thighs look amazing in my jeans, my butt is lifted and there is less & cellulite on the side and back on my thighs. I do this video in the morning Level 1 Mon, Level 2 Weds, and Level 3 Fridays and plain ole 30 mins of cardio on Tues and Thurs. And Hot Yoga on Sunday and Monday evenings.

The videos are about 40 mins long.. In three weeks along with eating right and cutting out alcohol altogether I've lost 14lbs, my butt honestly looks amazing. You have to do the workouts at LEAST 3x a week and I PROMISE you will see the results. Leave the alcohol and wine alone for a while if you are like me! Lol
Get the DVD..Commit to it.. show up and you will not be disappointed.",1342742400,21,1335,4.030188679245283
4522507,5,B0051GLDQI,What I really like about this workout video it's that Jillian michaels it's always giving opttions to make your workout harder or keep it at low pace if you are not use to some of the exercises. Very helpful video!,1342742400,,214,4.375
4522508,4,B0051GLDQI,Great workout.  Works your rump well.  I have other dvds by Jillian and am not fond of them.  This one I like a lot and plan to use it on a regular basis.  Thanks Jillian!,1341792000,,171,3.8
4522509,5,B0051GLDQI,This dvd is excellent as she provides a really good workout.  She also includes two other parties in the video for the people that work on a regular basis and for the beginner.  The warm-up feels like it should be part of the work out. Love this dvd.,1341446400,,250,4.1875
4522510,5,B0051GLDQI,I have more trouble toning my lower body then my upper body so I bought this DVD. I got it yesterday and tried it out today (really wanted to yesterday but the power went out) I don't know what level 1 is like because I started on level 2. It is a great workout and my legs were shaking at the end. I would recomend it. A side note: this dvd is cheaper at Walmart.,1341014400,2,364,3.8666666666666667
4522511,5,B0051GLDQI,Wow! The first time I completed this workout I was in pain. I am a teacher and I was going to bend down to help a student reading on the floor and I just had to let myself fall! ha! I've been doing Level 3 and I love it! My legs look and feel strong!

4522512,1,B0051GLDQI,"Before I get blasted for reviewing the format instead of the product, let me start by saying that I think this is important information for anyone considering this purchase. Based on the number of positive reviews, I'm assuming this is a relatively recent change to the way Amazon offers some products.

Anyway, I love Jillian Michaels' DVDs and was excited to try this one out. Imagine my disappointment when the display on my DVD player flashed ""loading"" for two solid minutes before giving me the message that the disc could not be read. I thought maybe it was dirty, so I took it out to clean it and immediately noticed that it looked strange, not like a typical DVD. I tried it out in my Blu-Ray player with the same result. My laptop CD/DVD drive was also unable to play it. (I have played DVD-Rs successfully in all of these players, so I don't know what makes this one different.)

So, I looked it up on Amazon and noticed the small ""DVD-R"" note. Then I looked up a few more Jillian DVDs and found another ""manufactured on demand"" with a negative review about how the DVD-R quality degraded over time. It seems like this format is problematic, and I want to make people aware of this. Unfortunately, a review based on the format seems to be the only way to get the word out.

I will be purchasing this DVD elsewhere to make sure I get the real deal next time.",1340150400,149,1367,4.438247011952191

4522515,5,B0051GLDQI,"I was at first sceptical about this dvd primarily because of the reviews. Most mentioned how Jillian was a little out of control with her Facebook and Twitter comments. I did notice that but I also feel that it was blown a bit out of proportion. I don't deny the fact that she brings up the comments and she does have some weird moments in the wokouts but I think it is more important to focus on the actual workout. This killed me! I could feel muscles working that I didn't know could burn the way they did. I have only done this workout a few times but I swear that there is already a visible difference in my lower body area. My friend even commented saying everything looked tighter and now she wants to join me. I should also mention my brother joined in on a few workouts. He is a big gym nut and works out for hours each day but he said he felt this workout more than his typical routine. My opinion, if random chatter from Jillian doesn't bother you than you will enjoy the workout.",1339200000,6,991,4.221052631578948
4522517,4,B0051GLDQI,"This is one of many Jillian Michaels DVDs that I own. I started with the 30 Day Shred and Yoga Meltdown, a couple years ago and after starting back up working out with Jillian, I wanted some more variety and some longer workouts. This workout is great for all of the leg muscles. The moves are very intense if you do them with proper form. I noticed that I got a much better burn in my legs when I used the entire range of motion in the exercises (i.e. dropping the knee all the way to the floor in a lunge or getting my thighs parallel to the floor during squats). If you are new to this workout you can work up to that range of motion. This workout is a little lower impact, believe it or not, than some of her other workouts. Less jumping and more lunges, squats, and kicks.  I haven't noticed drastic results thus far, but have only been doing these workouts for about 2 weeks, alternating with my other Jillian DVDs: 6 Week 6 Pack and Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism. I have noticed significant muscle soreness in my inner thighs, which is great because I've always had trouble targeting that area. Jillian is a bit more obnoxious in this DVD than the others, and that's why my review gets 4 stars instead of 5.",1339113600,,1213,4.296943231441048

I thought that I would only ""feel the burn"" in my buns and thighs (given the title), but this video also incorporates some core and upper body work as well. Some of the exercises incorporate pilates/yoga moves, so you will feel the burn in both your lower and upper body, although she does focus on the lower body. Overall, great workout.

Her personality is very strong in KBT.  If you like Jillian, you will love this one.  I found her engaging and tough.  I can see that if you like a softer leader, this will not be for you.  This is not my first Jillian video and yet, I am seeing results.  Good DVD.  I highly recommend.",1338768000,,430,4.158536585365853
4522521,5,B0051GLDQI,I LOVE level 2 and 3 of this workout DVD.  I actually think Level 2 is harder than Level 3.  Great way to get in shape for those short shorts or swim suits.

I never watched Biggest Loser, so I didn't know anything about her. Now, after owning several of her other DVD's, including the Body Revolution package, I love her to death. She knows what she's doing. She gives important tips for not getting injuries and modifications for those who can't quite do the moves. Most of my junk is in the trunk and this DVD really reduced the size after only a few months. Enough to feel comfortable in a bikini bottom instead of board shorts :-)",1338508800,4,604,4.401785714285714

While the legs, buns and thighs are the target, cardio, arms and abs are not ignored in true Jillian ""maximum efficiency"" style which I love.  You are never just working your buns and thighs there is usually an arm option to add-in which is great. I have been doing this workout 2-3 times a week for the past 2 weeks with her ripped in 30 on alternating days and already can see a more toned EVERYTHING- defintely effective and challenging, but do able. One caveat: I turn Jillian on low volume, turn on the subtitles because I like to know how many reps I have left in  set and she always gives a ""ok 2 more!"" which I need and then i CRANK my music and get into the zone!",1337558400,,815,4.119496855345912

So i laughed out loud when I realized I had ordered KILLER BUNS AND THIGHS. just saying that makes me say ""ouch!""
So out of a rut of not working out from being sick, i popped in the dvd and started with level one. On this first day, I remember saying to myself at least 5 times during the workout, ""she is crazy""
But THANK GOD for Jillian Michaels and her craziness!! My butt and thighs are more toned in just a week. no joke. I feel it in my butt and see it in my thighs.
And when I don't feel like putting KILLER BUNS AND THIGHS in my line up, I look at the cover and think- if my backside can look like Jillian's does here.. it's worth the pain. PLUS no push-ups!! haha",1337212800,,898,4.107954545454546

I immediately searched for buns & thigh workouts and bought this one as soon as I saw it. I have done it a few times now, and have already noticed a little more perkiness! The first time I did the work out I didn't get 100% out of it because I was trying to get the moves down, most were new to me. Second time I had it down way more. It's definitely a challenge and am nervous (but excited) for level two. I will first master this one though, I'm assuming it will take me a while! Jillian's voice and chit chat with the girls doesn't bother me at all, I'm way more focused on getting the moves down perfectly. Another thing- she doesn't *MAKE* you use weights like in 30 day shred, they are just optional, but I highly reccommend using them, I got a way better workout with them.",1335052800,7,1018,4.1206030150753765
4522614,5,B0051GLDQI,"I bought this DVD because I hold most of my weight in my hips, butt and thighs. I figured it was so inexpensive that I might as well give it a try.  I've done her 30 Day Shred on and off, but felt it was too short of a work out.  In the dvd she says it's a 30 minutes workout- which it is if you don't include the warm up and cool down.  I've only done level 1 and I did this workout two days in a row.  It's a much faster pace than 30 day shred and involves a lot more moves.  She mixes in a little cardio and some moves that work your upper body also.

After my first workout I definately felt the burn in my legs and decided instead of taking a day off that I would do the workout again. I can feel it so much more after the second day which is probably because I knew the moves better the 2nd time around.

People who gave this dvd lower reviews because of her flirty coversation with Natalie and her rant about facebook are being petty.  It's a great workout and I could barely pay attention to what she said about facebook because I was working so hard.  And I actually laughed when she spoke to Natalie.  It makes her seem more down to earth.  I think she is pretty cheesy- but I kinda like that about her.  Her workouts are great and if it is too easy for you just add heavier weights to the moves.  And honestly if you are in perfect shape- I'm not sure why you are wasting your time with workout DVD's.  Just put that money towards a good bootcamp and stop complaining.

And if you are just starting to workout I would start with her 30 Day Shred so you can build up some arm muscle.  She does a lot of plank work and you will have a lot of difficulty with some of the moves.

Overall though- awesome workout!",1334793600,28,1719,3.97953216374269

That being said, her DVD's are incrediable!  This is the third one I bought and it is such a workout. I did level two last week-thinking I was ready for it, I could hardly walk for 2 days.  On the DVD's she pushs so hard and uses muscles that I don't think I ever used.  I really do expect to get results working on this DVD.

In just the week I rented this DVD from my library I noticed a tremendous difference in how I filled out my pants and skirts. I can't wait until I can buy the DVD to keep for myself. And I didn't even get to levels two and three yet! Jillian says that level one is a 'toning' level but my booty is more curved than it was before, I can't wait to get through the DVD and pass it along to my friends.

As for those people who put up the negative comments about Jillian's 'shrillish banter', they can shut up. She's the one with the skill and generosity to share her gift with others. She doesn't always have to be a drill sergeant and this is more targeted for women so why shouldn't she come off as someone trying to be personable? The woman's attitude is appropriate for a booty workout, which should be fun. And if you're too concerned with her talking and laughing, OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE NOT WORKING HARD ENOUGH. I don't even hear that anymore because I'm too busy getting a juicy booty with my weights and reps.

However, I really wanted some workouts I could do at home in the morning before work or when I couldn't make it to the gym that DIDN'T take over an hour to get through.  So I figured I'd give Jillian a try....and I absolutely love it.  Killer Buns and Thighs, or super booty workout as I like to call it, is great.  There are three workout segments to chose from with a wide range of exercies that you definitely feel in your legs and tush.  I tried a fitness bootcamp with my boyfriend, and I feel like this workout is just as intense as the bootcamp at a fraction of the price.  Best of all, I can get it done in under an hour, so I don't have to get up at 5 a.m. if I want to do the workout before getting ready for work.  I can also pair this workout with running or other cardio.  I definitely recommend this, as well as her other workout videos.",1333411200,5,1028,4.0495049504950495

Yea, I am swearing at her during the whole workout and am telling her to shut up and that she's crazy, which she is, but even with all of that, I feel amazing when I am done with the workout. My ""buns and thighs"" are toned and butt is lifted just after level one. It works out my abs and arms too! I am a true believer of Jillian.

But the first time I pushed myself with this video I felt the results immediately! I could barely walk downstairs my legs were shaking and, man, were they sore the following few days.

I'm working to make and keep a healthy body without paying a personal trainer. Jillian is a great fit for me--I can workout at home, for only a half hour at a time if I want, and feel the results. She helps you mold the body you would like to have. I'm stickin' with the Killer!",1332806400,5,1000,4.410810810810811

When I began level one of KBandTh, I was challenged but able to push through because one's body remembers.  I was, at the same time, reassured that Jillian knows what she is doing.  The sequences are terrific:  after a particularly gruelling routine, recovery is provided whilst one keeps moving.  She's a star ... Thank you, Jillian!  With the reassurance that she truly is a fitness guru, I was inspired recently to order 3 more of her work outs.  Looking forward to the journey.",1332633600,2,644,4.547826086956522

The woman who checked me out chuckled a bit and said she didn't liked jillian,,,and I joked back neither did I. Took the dvd home and was blown away..Ive worked with Shaun T's dvd and P90X...jillian can do what they do without the weights with out all the jumping around...her warm ups don't feel like a chore and you leave your workout feeling STRONG. The lady @ the library is misguided...and I owe Jillian a big apology...I thought she was a flake ...but she is the best a genius...she will work you hard and kick your buttt and in the end you will love her for it.  The buns dvd is awesome too, Im only doing level one until I maaster my breathing and it becomes to simple...but I also have other Jillian Michaels stuff on its way too...she is worth it ...good good teacher!",1332115200,5,973,4.375690607734807

4522674,5,B0051GLDQI,"I got this video because I wanted to tone my but and thighs. And trust me when I say, it's definitely working! Jillian starts out with some basic jumping up and down to get your body moving. I thought that would be enough of a warm up for me, however the next day my legs hurts so bad, I couldn't stand up or sit down without help, and I'm only 23. I HIGHLY recommend stretching before you start. She talks about not wanting to do ""static stretching"", but if you're out of shape and just getting back into working out, stretch a good amount before you start! You may regret it in the morning like I did.
Other than that, just stick with it, and move up from level to level!",1331424000,2,673,4.145038167938932

I would not recommend this for a beginner...but if you are an intermediate or advance exerciser...this will do the trick.

4522677,5,B0051GLDQI,"Please do not be fooled by the inane comments about her personality. Sometimes I feel like she just can't win with people. Either she is too tough and people hate her or she is too talkative (which I find comical) and people hate her. Either way, this is a solid workout. And during the moments where my buns and thighs were burning or I was out of breath, I found her one liners to be funny. I own ALL of her DVDs and I think she is just a lot more comfortable and herself in her most recent videos. She jokes like this in Six Week Six Pack and there are vestiges of humor in 30 Day Shred (especially between her and Natalie). If you are pear shaped (which I am) you really can't go wrong with this DVD. Just ignore the other comments and buy it; she isn't talking about facebook or twitter for the full 30 minutes. You won't regret it. Because she WILL push you, but you WILL get results. I have been an AVID supporter of hers and without her I would not have lost 25 pounds last year.

Liked that the workout doesn't have as many lunges as other JM DVDs that I have to limit due to killing my knees---no matter how careful of form I am. I do this DVD back-to-back with another JM DVD like the Abs DVD. I'm still on level 1 and find that Jillian talks WAY too much. It's like she has a crush (or dating?) the advanced assistant, Natalie, (on our left as we view the DVD). It gets really annoying to see her flirt with Natalie the whole time! Also the the last song on the 2nd circuit can drive you up a wall. Between the song and Jillian's constant flirting and bitching about viewer's comments, I'm ready to put the sound on mute. All that being said, I do like the actual workout. Jillian, for the next DVD, cool-it on the flirting and complaints.",1330732800,3,806,4.240259740259741

I just started this week and I have only done #1 so I can not comment on the other 2 but this is a fun workout that works. I am an ex body builder and you can feel that this workout will definantly produce results. One of the reviews mentioned her comments about FaceBook & Twitter but she only made 1 about each web site and I wasn't bothered by this at all. Love her energy and her personality. I recommend this work-out! 4 stars because there are afew of her exercises that I would use caution doing. Definantly watch your form because the knees will pay if you do not.,1330041600,7,679,4.190839694656488
4522712,5,B0051GLDQI,"I got cocky and started with Level 2. Big Mistake. You can't really follow through since she goes by the moves quickly (some of the moves were new to me).
I ended up getting irritated half way through the workout and wasted a workout day.
So - Read the Recommendation and Do level 1 first!

A note about her 'twitter' comment - I understand that she wants to get the message out to people that if the workout was too easy, they probably need to increase the resistance. But it could have been phrased in a different way. I don't care personally - after all she is human. But it does distract you from the workout for just a sec.

Word of warning - It is Hard on the knees! If you have a knee injury of any kind, be very very careful. The workout is hard and does what it promises, and thats why it gets 5 stars.",1329955200,6,811,4.09433962264151

Level 2, in my opinion, is more difficult than level 3.  I'm giving this 4 stars because several of the moves did aggravate my knees.  Jillian does certain moves that, in my opinion, shouldn't be performed at a fast pace - for example, jumping lunges.  You cannot keep proper form on a lunge while moving at a pace like that.  So, I modified that it by simply moving at my own pace, to ensure proper form.  I also do not do the ""reverse squats.""  Those really bothered my knees.  I just substitute another move in its' place.  I have no issue with any of the other moves.  Since I have incorporated this tape into my routine, my legs have DRAMATICALLY changed shape.  Everyone I know has noticed.  You can still get great results even if you have to omit some of the moves and replace them with others, to save your knees.  It's a tough workout, but definitely doable.",1329782400,28,1040,4.316062176165803

4522717,5,B0051GLDQI,"It's been three years since Jillian Michaels changed my life.  Something in her voice told me to ""keep going"" and for some reason, I listened.

I look fit and secure and my metabolism has enabled a more leisurely lifestyle.  Doing her workouts for at least six months means you will lose weight, but you will change the way your body burns fat and calories.  You will also change the foods your body craves.

After more than than three years with her three staple CD's--30 Day Shred, Banish Fat and BOost Metabolism, and No More Troublezones--I wanted a new challenge.  And she gave me one.  Holy *****.  I love the Plyo!  In fact, when people ask me what I do to look so ripped and shapely, I say, ""Plyo and Circuit Training"" and then they ask me ""What?"" and so I show them my mean jump-squats!

Bravo Jillian!  Your laugh is infectious and I hope you keep coming back to me for years to come...you're the workout buddy for CRAZY People!  (the good crazies!)

I wish she had a DVD of just her doing each exercise so I could concentrate to try to get things down.

Of course after trying it a bunch of times I can get it done right but even her beginner type DVD's have her popping up and running around after only doing an exercise 1-2x.",1329177600,4,636,3.7669172932330826

I was on level 1 and needed to modify some of her moves because my knees would kill for days afterwards or my back.  You will have needed someone to really show you how to do burpees with good form before engaging in this workout.  The risk is like me you are a cardio queen with some weight room experience that doesn't translate into good form on some of these combination movements.

4522746,5,B0051GLDQI,"I got this DVD back in the fall, and have done Level 1 consistently (1-2x per week) mixed in with a few other Jillian DVDs since then. A few weeks on Level 1, I tried Level 2... and I really thought I was going to die! So, Level 1 it was. However, despite being 'stuck' at Level 1, I definitely have noticed my thighs, hammies (as jillian calls them!), and butt getting smaller, stronger, and more defined. I have defined thigh muscles for the first time EVER and I'm absolutely thrilled at my progress in just a few months.

In early January, I started her Ripped in 30 series, but added Level 1 of Killer Buns and Thighs onto that. Ripped in 30 is hard, but it just isn't long enough, and this added into my workout routine is perfect. I upped it to Level 2 today, and I am absolutely SHOCKED at how different it was this time around, as opposed to when I first tried it. Yes, it's hard. Yes, I was burning. But, my balance, stability, endurance, and fitness level have dramatically increased! I was able to do the advanced version most of the time, and only had to stop and catch my breath a few times. I used to never, ever, ever be able to do plyometric moves, and now I can not only do them, but can do them with good form and don't feel like I am going to die.

This DVD is definitely a worthwhile addition to any fitness routine, and I highly recommend trying it. Even if you can't do the whole thing, or have to modify/take breaks, sticking with it, working up to it, and believing in your ability to change will make all the difference. I'm amazed at my progress and now make excuses to work out, instead of finding ways to avoid it.",1327881600,17,1643,4.229299363057325

I also started to get bored. So i think doing only section of this at a time is best! The next day my butt was sore, it works.

Talking about twitter/facebook comments which I did not care to hear about during my work out. I found that completely inappropriate, talk about it some place else. I consider myself an intermediate to advanced exercise level. Her Level 1 workouts are challenging enough, I cannot imagine what Level 3 would be and I don't want to know. Her workout moves I feel can easily induce injury. I don't believe an exercise move has to be crazy difficult to be effective.  I personally like Jackie Warner and Cathe Friedrich so much better. They deliver very tough effective workouts without all the complicated moves and the annoying chitter chatter. If you like Jillian you might like this DVD,I think maybe I just don't like her style.

Veterans of her workouts will like that she stays true to her familar circuit system, and that she uses some moves you're used to while also incorporating some new exercises.  I'm no novice -- I've completed a marathon and P90X -- but even moves in level one (a static sumo squat to jumps while in a sumo squat!) make me feel the burn.  I always love that she has beginner and advanced moves in each level, which makes the 3 workouts more like having 9 levels.  With the number of workouts on each DVD and the price, these are one of the best deals in the market.

I agree with some of the other reviewers -- it can be annoying to hear her complain about people making negative comments on Facebook and Twitter.  Hey Jillian, we keep buying your DVDs because we love them, so don't let the haters get you down!  I love being able to recommend the workouts to my friends who are starting to begin a program, so their accessibility and versatility is a plus.  People who want seriously intense workouts can purchse P90X or Insanity.

This one especially targets those ""trouble"" areas, buns and thighs and you will feel the burn when doing this video. It does offer different levels so you can work your way up to the more advanced workouts. Grab yourself a good mat and some water and you are ready to begin. I workout to this video at least a couple of times a week along with Jillian's other DVD's (including her yoga)and believe me, this compliments the others great!!",1325721600,,597,4.245614035087719

She likes it a lot and finds it challenging (in a good way), but some videos really need a menu to help navigate and this is one of them.  Since the video has three levels, if you want to do the second or third level you have to keep trying to skip forward using trial and error until you find the other levels.  It helps that she wears different colors for each level (since you can just look for a change of color to know it's another level).",1325635200,,510,4.02970297029703

I have many of Jillian's dvds and this is by far the HARDEST workout EVER!  I'm so excited that I finally have an in home workout that ranks up there with those of my own personal trainer's!  Thank you Jillian for going above and beyond your other workout dvds for those that are more advanced!,1325635200,,407,3.9390243902439024

4522799,5,B0051GLDQI,Even though this is a Jillian video I did not expect it to be so difficult.  Oh my goodness!!! Level 1 is not so bad but you get to 2 and 3 and she is doing moves that seem impossible and I love it.  It is crazy hard and is definitely not for someone who is not committed but if you are an avid Jillian user and you want a challenge get this DVD.,1325462400,,346,3.6621621621621623
4522800,5,B0051GLDQI,"I started working out with Jillian last year as a sophomore in college. I didn't have time to go to the gym at school because it took an extra hour out of my day, which I didn't have. This is the second DVD I bought, and I AM IN LOVE. I was an athlete in high school and I wanted an intense leg workout with some cardio involved. I started at level 1 and couldn't do every move perfectly, but I'm on level 2 right now.

IF SOMEONE DOESN'T THINK THIS WORKOUT IS HARD, JILLIAN IS RIGHT.... THEY CAN'T BE DOING IT RIGHT OR ADD MORE WEIGHT!
I used to lift in high school intensely so I know a good workout and this is a GREAT WORKOUT!

For those who complain about Jillian throughout the videos, she may talk all of the time but I find her motivating. And so what if she talks a lot, it's her video!

If you want a good workout to tone your legs and incorporate cardio at the same time, I 100% recommend this DVD. You will not be disappointed if you do it right!

I do not recommend this DVD for someone who has never worked out or does not know how to do proper squats, lunges, etc... THIS IS NOT A BEGINNER DVD, and Jillian does not do a ton of explaining on how to do each move properly. Learn how to protect your knees and back before trying this DVD. Once you become more experienced, give it a try!",1325376000,3,1300,4.0271317829457365
4522801,4,B0051GLDQI,"Well, I'll be honest- I've only done the work out once so far. I read many reviews on this one before buying and the only downside I read was that she talks too much. True, she does but she talks in her other videos, nothing new just turn the volume down.  The only big reason I didn't give this one a 5 is because it was really hard on my knees. My glutes and thighs are still a bit sore, but my knees are still killing me.  I have a bad knee so I took that into account but my other knee is still bothering me.

Another thing I didn't care for but will like later is she doesn't take a couple seconds to introduce the moves like ripped in 30.  But of course after the 3rd or 4th round that won't be a problem, but I kept falling behind because she would jump from move to move and I'm still trying to figure out what to do.

It's a tough one though, I couldn't keep up with some of the ""beginner"" modifications at times and I'm in decent shape.

I'd definitely recommend it, just make sure your knees are supported some how if they're a bit weak.",1325289600,,1048,4.014423076923077

They are both fun and definitely do-able (especially with the beginner modifications). I recently tried to do level 3 (after a week at level 1 and 2 weeks at level 2) and found it far too difficult. Other reviewers said that level 2 is more difficult than level 3, so I may need to give it another shot. I am now alternating between levels 3 and 4 of ""Ripped in 30"", level 2 of this DVD, ""Banish fat..."", and ""No more trouble zones.""

Well, I have used it probably 5x now (I take 2 days off after I workout since it's a large muscle group to let it repair/rebuild). All I can say is I have already seen an improvement. I am not trying to toot my own horn at all, but I did have a decent base to start with so my results might be quicker than some just because of that reason. But these workouts do legitimately make a difference. I have seen an improvement in fullness, roundness, better glute-hamstring tie-in, and lift. I can't wait to see the improvements over the next couple months. Yay :)",1324944000,2,717,4.279411764705882

I am only on level 1, I was able to get through the entire workout, however, I did find the moves challenging and a great complement to the P90X workout.  Jillian's constant chatter about random things was quite annoying in the beginning. I would prefer that she just encourage those working out to push through the burn and focus on the outcome.  However, as I continued to workout to the DVD, a wonderful thing happened... I no longer paid attention to her comments! If you can get over the talking, and just focus on the exercises, you will get a good workout, and eventually see results; and in the end that is the point.  I recommend this video to anyone who is trying to sculpt and tone their lower half. Jillian really does work every muscle.",1324857600,2,894,4.4

I've been wanting to improve my lower body. So you know I was thrilled to find this DVD. If anybody's gonna get me in shape, it's gotta be Jillian, right? Well...

Since buying this disc two months ago, I've only used it four times. I CANNOT get past level 1. Don't get me wrong! Like the other two DVDs, the workout is challenging yet fun. However, IT IS KILLER ON MY KNEES. I have never had a knee injury and don't consider mine to be weak. But after 40 minutes of level 1, my knees feel just plain wonky and stay that way for many hours afterward.

I feel things going wrong right from the warm up. Once you're in the proper workout, Jillian has an extensive amount of jumping, lunges and squats. But what seems to do the most damage is the floor work. You are on your knees for what feels like five to six minutes doing ""fire hydrants,"" ""donkey kicks"" and other forms of torture.

Yes, I'm doing the modified versions. And yes, I'm concentrating on my form (like the Dickens!). But my knees STILL don't feel right.

I like Jillian. I like level 1 of this DVD. But my knees are not a fan.",1323993600,45,1332,4.312
4522819,5,B0051GLDQI,"Over the course of this summer/fall I've become a huge Jillian fan.  I wasn't too excited about this title because I like to get a full body workout, but I gave it a shot.  I'm so glad I did.  This workout rocks!  I was already in pretty good shape, but I had no idea that my legs could ever be like this.  That blob of fat at the top of my thigh / bottom of butt disappeared within a few weeks of rotating this in with other daily workouts-- I didn't know that could even happen!  It does a great job of toning and burning the fat off your legs without bulking you up -- I tend to put muscle on easily, too.  So I give sky high marks for the results.

The workouts are also quite fun, but they are difficult.  I put the first one on expecting it to be like week 1 in Ripped in 30 (one to skip over if you are already in shape).  But, even level 1 burned and got the sweat pouring.  I also agree that level 2 might be more of a challenge than level 3 -- but they are both plenty hard.

As others have mentioned, some of the goofing around is a bit annoying, but it detracts little from the overall quality (and nothing from the results).",1323820800,49,1137,3.960352422907489

I, like many others, started using Jillian and then went shopping crazy and bought a bunch videos.  Killer Buns & Thighs is intense- EVEN LEVEL 1! I am excited that it will take me a while to build up the strength to ""graduate"" to the next level.  It is jam-packed with awesome moves that work every area of the legs and even abs while keeping your heart rate up.

Get started with Jillian!!  It really will change your workout experience and in the end will change lots of other areas of your life.  We have 5 DVD's we are rotating thru to keep us motivated thru winter and so far- so good:)  Good luck!!",1323820800,26,967,4.2228260869565215

I think if you spend money on buying a product, you are entitled to comment. I'm in Cape Town, so had to spend extra cost on shipping and VAT. I enjoyed the 30 Day Shred workouts and thought this would be a great addition to my workout routine but I am put off by the fact that JM uses profanity and uses God's name.

Im not a fan of jillians facetious remarks and quips with natalie however the workout is well worth dealing with that, plus Jillian gives excellent tips throughout.  I also agree with other reviewers that this is NOT for all levels.  I pause and drink water between the sets and if Im low on energy this is a tough workout for me to get through, and thats still level 1.

Well, I am 2 weeks into Level 1, and it is kicking my ass!!!  Thank You Ms. Michaels!  I actually like her workout better than the leg workout from P90x.  KB&T is shorter, but it is constant, non-stop kick your butt workouts (Keep in mind I have only done level 1)..  I can't wait to get to level 2 & 3!!!  P90x was long, lots of breaks, and took FOREVER.  I also appreciate that the KB&T seem to focus on women's trouble areas.  So I am already seeing a more feminine sculpture vs. P90x ""Man Muscles!""

4522826,5,B0051GLDQI,"Having done the 30 Day Shred, Shred it with Weights, and 6 Week Six-Pack, I expected Killer Buns and Thighs to be Jillian's typical (and extremely effective) mix of cardio, weights and resistance. But this one is a little different to the others. Namely, there are longer periods of repetition in the resistance moves- you hold stances longer, repeat moves more, and stay in similar positions for different exercises. For example, in Level 1 you do back-to-back moves in Sumo squat- different exercises, same position. This kind of repetition really, really hurts. It reminds me a bit of the Tracy Anderson workouts on YouTube, but obviously much better.
No question, Killer Buns and Thighs had me in more pain than any of Jillian's other workouts. And I always absolutely kill myself during her routines. I have a rule that if I can speak in the 10 seconds immediately after doing one of her workouts, I'm not working hard enough.

Killer Buns and Thighs still has weights, cardio and resistance, like her others, but you don't huff and puff from cardio so much, but more from trying to hold and repeat the positions and exercises for the length of time required. It's similar to the way Olympic weight lifters huff and puff when they lift the equivalent of an African elephant. Basically, you put a huge amount of strain on your body and you can FEEL it. But the results come very quickly. The last of the flab on my upper thighs completely toned up in about 3 days, which blew me away. And the vibe of the whole thing is pretty fun- Jillian laughs a lot and jokes around with Natalie and Anita (the 30 Day Shred girls), which takes your mind off the pain a bit.

Each level lasts for about 40 minutes, which is a little longer than some of her other DVDs. I do this workout five days a week, which leaves time for muscle recovery. Needless to say, this workout is very challenging, even Level 1. You need to already have very well-developed muscles, and a very strong core, otherwise you literally will not be able to do about 70% of the moves. I would advise anyone who is not pretty fit to first do 30 Day Shred, or 6 Week Six-Pack before attempting this DVD. The copy on the back of the DVD is misleading because it basically says that unfit people can do this workout- I completely disagree with that. I had come straight off 6 Week Six-Pack, which pretty much gave me thighs and abs of steel (!) and I still couldn't hold all of the positions for the full amount when I first started. It's tough. But it's worth it.",1322956800,39,2523,4.506550218340611

If you want to target the tush and thighs this certainly does it, and the circuits go pretty fast, you get some cardio.  I wouldn't recommend for the true beginner, if you aren't used to working out hard you would have to take this pretty slow, and just keep up the best you can.",1322179200,4,665,3.9185185185185185

I like this workout because she seems to go back to a more reasonably paced workout that makes you sweat bullets but gives you time to maintain proper form.

Warm up: jumping jacks, lunge into warrior, squatting vine step, flying pigeon, windmill skaters. (the workout begins with the warm-up)

Circuit 1: Speed squats, surrenders, sumo squats with weights, single leg runners ( single leg squat), and squat hops.

Circuit 2: Burpees to superman, reverse squat, double unders (double jumprope), single leg thrusts, statue of liberty (single leg squat with a weight touching the opposite toe and a squat at the top)

Circuit 3: jumping lunge, single leg burpee, step ups (onto a chair) with a backward lunge off the chair while holding a weight, single leg thrusts with a chair, pop ups

Circuit 4: Leg extension, side lunge with a jump, dancing crab, lateral hops, and star jumps

I was gargling my heart by the end!!! My Garmin wasn't charged so unfortunately, I don't have a heart rate or calorie burn.  I haven't done level 3 yet.

I tried several Beachbody products (P90X, Turbo Jam and Fire, etc.) and they worked fine. However, my favorites are all Jillian Michael's DVDs. For this particular one, I actually enjoy the moves, well, I usually do the modified version and even created my own if it gets too challenging. Don't be intimidated by the levels. I didn't find level 3 THAT much harder than level 1. I alternate all 3 levels just to avoid repetitions. All in all, it is a highly effective program.",1321401600,,609,4.545454545454546

4522849,5,B0051GLDQI,"I have been doing Jillian Michaels workouts for the past couple years, starting with 30DS, then NMTZ, BFBM, SIWW, 6W6P and RI30.  While all of her other workouts gave great toning results, this one really focuses on your lower body, as the title implies.  I used to run track in high school, and my legs and buns have not been this toned since then.

Level 1 was *tough*, and I thought I was going to *die* half way through Level 2, but I worked hard and eventually (after ~2 weeks on each level) moved on to Level 3.  I agree with other reviewers that Level 3 is not as scary as Jillian implies just before and during the warmup.  It didn't feel quite as intense as Level 2, but just as hard, if that makes sense.  Once you get past the first circuit, it's not so bad.

I also appreciate that the cool downs get more thorough with each level.  I almost wish she did the Level 3 cooldown after each.

I have and i love the workouts, they really work you hard, which is exactly what i need.

I only did level 1 to try it out! Needless to say, I will definitely recommend this workout. I will probably combine it with the workouts I have been doing as well.

It reminds me of Ripped in 30, which I love and this work out makes me sweat even more than her other DVD's.  My husband and I get up every morning and work out to one of Jillian Michael's DVD's and this one is kicking our butts.  We have been doing these DVD's for about a year, 5 days a week and have noticed huge changes in our bodies.  I have not really lost weight but have changed the shape of my legs and muscles a lot!  My husband said when he started, his belt latched on the 3rd hole, and how he is on the 5th hole.  Pretty soon he will need a smaller belt.  He looks more trim and fit than I have ever seen him look.  We highly recommend her DVD's because they are short and super effective.  Everyone can spare a half hour of their day.  We get up at 5:20 in the morning to work out becuase he have to be out of the house by 7:30 to either work or get the kids to school.

I could be doing one move and think i cannot go on, but the next move will ""relax"" that same area that was just being worked so I CAN go on.
This video primarily works the outer thighs, buns and backs of legs, all problem areas for me, and for many women (and many men).

It's just been an uphill battle with my thighs.  Over the years I have tried Buns of Steel, The Firm, Denise Austin, etc.  Other newer trainers really get on my nerves and/or their workouts take too long  i.e. P90X).
 I just started with Level 1 of the Killer Buns&Thighs two nights ago after several months of not working out.  Wow!!  I managed to get through it, although trembling and very very sweaty!!  I felt sore, but great this morning, so I did it again tonight.  I just feel like this is finally the workout that is going to make a difference and help me give myself the legs of my dreams.

I've read the other reviews & I agree w/ a lot of comments;  I find Jillian Michaels rather irritating in this dvd!  I own several other dvd's of hers (as well as some of ""The Biggest Loser"" dvd's) and found her instruction on those videos very helpful.  I don't think she stops talking AT ALL during ""Killer Buns & Thighs""!  I wouldn't mind this except that most of her commentary has less to do w/ giving instruction and more to do w/ enjoying bothering Natalie (from ""30 Day Shred"").

I also agree w/ other reviewers that the music in this video isn't so great-some songs sound like they're from the 80's/early 90's (1 song actually has lyrics-2 whole words being looped: ""It's Alright"").  This isn't a deal-breaker for me, 'cause I normally turn down the volume & crank my iPod once I get used to a routine.

One thing I really like is how there are number of shorter circuits (vs. 2 longer ones on her ""6 Week 6 Pack"" dvd), however, I would like it even more if it would tell you on the screen which circuit you're currently in (like on her ""30 Day Shred"" dvd).

4522873,4,B0051GLDQI,"I received my pre-ordered copy of Jillian Michaels' new DVD, ""Killer Buns & Thighs"" in the mail last week - and it wasn't until last night that I had the opportunity to give it a whirl!

Let me preface this by saying that I was NOT in the mood to workout yesterday. I procrastinated as best I could, nearly talked myself into curling up with my Nook e-Reader instead of doing a workout at all. It was cold out, and my fleece pants and Snuggie were looking pretty tempting.

But since I'm headed on vacation in a few days where I won't be working out a whole lot, and will be baring a whole lot of skin on the beach, I convinced myself to do something. I decided to try KB&T, thinking if Jillian couldn't pull me out of the funk I was in, then no one could.

KB&T has three levels - the first level requires a mat and a set of hand weights, while levels two and three add in a chair to mix things up a bit. I bet you could make it even more difficult by using an exercise ball instead of a chair, but that remains to be seen. I'm sure it's hard enough without adding difficulty, if it's like Jillian's other workouts!

I did Level 1 last night - 5lb weights. Jillian starts with a pretty comprehensive warmup, focusing on the muscles that are going to get the brunt of the action in the ~30 minutes that follow. Even in the first circuit, my butt was burning! My quads were screaming and my hammies were feelin' like Jell-O. Level 1 had a good amount of plank work, variety of lunges (curtsies), front/side/back kicks, some plyo work, side planks with inner thigh lifts, old school mat work and of course, some cardio thrown in there with butt kicks and high knees. Needless to say, I was sweating bullets by the end of it.

I have been extremely exciting about the Killer Buns and Thighs DVD to come out as these are my biggest problem areas and I thought if Jillian couldn't help me with them then I don't think anyone can. I have done Level 1 (2) times in the past three days, with a day off in between when I just did cardio (running). Although I am not as sore as I thought I would be, I still feel it for sure!

4522877,5,B0051GLDQI,"I love Jillian's videos and have several of them. But, it's been awhile since I've been doing her videos consistently, so I did Level 1 of this video somewhat cold turkey.

I really like the workout, but it's TOUGH. If you're a beginner or coming off of a Jillian break, I would start with another Level 1 workout, like 30 Day Shred or 6 Week 6 Pack Level 1, give yourself a week of some beginner toning, and then do this video. All of the squats and lunges are pretty intermediate moves even in Level 1 and so you might be a little frustrated if you feel your legs aren't strong or you don't have the flexibility.

I will say though, the cardio isn't hard, so if that's what you're worried about you should be fine.",1316044800,10,716,4.257352941176471

However, she grated on my nerves. My 15 old thought the same thing. She NEVER stops talking and her voice goes into a shrill tone when she is trying to be 'cool' and funny. All the chatter I found to be very distracting. I would give just the work out (sans all the distraction) 5 stars.

I prefer Jillian when she is serious and no-nonsense, but this time it seems like she is trying to be something she is not.

She carries on with Nat (one of her ""best girls"") quite a bit...like when you take a class and a few people are personal friends with the instructor. They joke between themselves...the rest of the class continues to work out while they giggle and play with one another...The connection between Nat, Anita and Jillian in Shred was pleasant, this was not.

She complains about the comments her users post on her Twitter and Facebook accounts (""it pisses me off!"") and I found that to be very unprofessional. Granted, it must be difficult reading criticism about yourself, but a true professional will find the tread of truth, take it with dignity, and apply what is valid. To be sour toward the very people that are spending their money on your product seems to be ultimately self-defeating and frankly, arrogant.

I purchased this before it was released because I have enjoyed all her other dvd's. I will definitely not buy her next one without pre-viewing it first.

4522884,4,B0051GLDQI,"I agree with most of the other reviewers in that Killer Buns & Thighs does not disappoint.  I was a little hesitant to pre-order the DVD simply because I enjoy full body work-outs.  In true Jillian fashion you not only work your legs and booty until the muscles are quivering, but she also gives you a solid dose of cardio!  Phew!

My only complaint, as one other reviewer has pointed out, is that Natalie continues her cheating ways from 30 Day Shred.  I'm also not a fan of her commentary to Jillian.  I'll chalk it up to my ""work-out personality.""  I like to show up, shut-up and sweat...bring back Basheera indeed!  I also don't want to be doing a better job/working harder than the bad-ass version model (Natalie).

All in all, I would recommend it! The work-outs are too good, and eventually, once I learn the moves, I can just watch it on mute.",1315872000,,851,4.474025974025974
4522885,5,B0051GLDQI,"This DVD will definitely give you killer buns and thighs. There is also some light upper body in the work out. This is a challenging work out, you will feel the burn no matter what level of athlete (or non) you are. Highly recommend!",1315872000,,233,4.318181818181818
4522886,5,B0051GLDQI,"I love Jillian & have all of her DVDs & do them 6 days per wk religiously. Altho I could probably start on the hardest level, I always start w/ level 1 so that I can be familiar w/the moves & not hurt myself. I'm 52 & can't afford injuries. Unless you are a full time athlete or trainer, Jillian's workouts can be as hard as you make them. I am in pretty good shape for my age (probably in better shape than most 20 yr olds) & she always gives me a good workout w/ cardio. As jillian clearly spells out in Level 1 on this DVD...to make it harder, add weights. Or, perfect your form. Level 1 didn't seem too hard w/out weights (except for the side planks w/leg lifts) but 1 day later my butt is sore. I alternate all of her DVDs for muscle confusion, but do the new ones a couple of days in a row, advancing to the higher levels. I'm looking forward to Lev 2 &3. If you haven't worked out w/ Jillian before, she is the best! Jillian puts P90 to shame. You can be out of shape & start out by modifying the exercises to suit your abilities, but it will be a challenge. If you don't have guts, try something else. If you want to look great, try Jillian. These workouts have really given me a much better body. I've lost weight, feel great, toned up all over & feel like I look fantastic for my age. Altho I always love getting compliments (who doesn't????), it is almost embarrassing because people frequently tell me I look great. I love Jillian's line on another dvd about 'your arms are one part of your body that the world sees naked, so make sure they look good'. Feeling like you look good makes you feel great at any age. If you REALLY want to look & feel great, buy Jillian.",1315872000,9,1678,4.134556574923548
4522887,5,B0051GLDQI,"Jillian is my favorite. This is another GREAT workout DVD for you to add to your Jill collection.  My buns and thighs were definitely killing even after the first workout.  Let's see how Workout 2 & 3 go next week :).  I highly recommend this and ANY of Jillian's workout DVDs.

UPDATE YA'll!  Level 1 is hard.  BUT LEVEL 2 AND 3 ARE ABSOLUTELY INSANE IN THE BUTT BRAIN.  I mean, how does she come up with some of these moves?!  THE FROG JUMP!? WHAT WHAT?!?!?!  Those of you who have gotten to level 3 know what I'm talking about, and those on their way to level 3, HAVE FUN!

I saw somebody mentioned how Jillian talks non-stop (and found it annoying) in this particular DVD, and she does.  But I found it rather amusing and motivating..haha.",1315785600,,743,4.350364963503649
4522888,5,B0051GLDQI,"I own the 30 day shred and when I started that video I nearly died the first week. I managed to make it to level 3 by the 4th week and I feel so good. I ordered Buns and Thighs this week and I just finished it not 20 minutes ago. Another great workout by Jillian. She had a couple of the same moves in this video that she has in her 30 day shred. (Jump rope, high kicks, butt kicks) but other than those, every single excercise was new. My thighs burned so bad I could barely finish each set. Sweat was dripping from me after 10 minutes. What I really liked was her motivating attitude in the video. I also liked how she told you what leg we were were working on. In the 30 day shred video she just said, ""opposite leg"" so at times I forgot what leg I used earlier. I also liked how she set up the circuits in this video. It was more structured.

I can still feel my legs burning right now. I can't wait to do this video again Sunday. I plan to do this video 3 days a week along with the 30 day shred every day. Get this video! You will have fun and you will get great legs in no time. I LOVE JILLIAN!! (so does my husband) lol.",1315526400,11,1128,3.883116883116883
4522889,5,B0051GLDQI,"WOW!!! Is all I can say! I just finished this workout on level 2, thinking I'm too in shape for level 1, and all I can say is WOW! This is a fat burning, sweat dripping, ass kicking work out! I own ""Get Ripped in 30"" and work out almost every day a week, so I'm always looking to add to the routine. And ""Get Ripped in 30"" is looking easy compared to this. Although it is aimed at thighs and butts, she works out every part of your body from cardio, to weights. Another great work out DVD to add to the Jillian collection!",1315526400,2,522,3.980952380952381
4522890,5,B0051GLDQI,"I have purchased everything from ""8 minute buns"" to devoting myself to the thigh master, and I can honestly say that Jillian's video is hands down the best lower body workout I have ever done.  After 3 days of working out to the dvd I felt a major difference and could tell I was really working my gluts and quads...The music is very catchy and all in all I rate this with 5 stars!!",1315440000,3,382,4.162162162162162
4522891,5,B0051GLDQI,"Because I do not like gyms or their expense, I have always turned to workout dvd's to get my sweat on. I am a runner, first & foremost, so I am always on the lookout for good at-home dvd's that I use to cross train. I have used everything from Tae-Bo, to Tracy Anderson, to Biggest Loser, Winsor Pilates, heck, I even tried Jane Fonda! But NOTHING has ever come close to Jillian Michaels. I got into the best shape of my life using her No More Trouble Zones & Blast Fat, Boost Metabolism dvd's after having my third child. I used NMTZ exclusively for cross-training while training for a half marathon last year & was running 7:45 minute miles. So when I heard that Jillian was coming out with a butt & thighs dvd, I pre-ordered it as soon as it became available. Because runner's need strong legs & booties to really run at prime, this dvd was like an answer to prayer from the running gods.

There are three levels: Level one, which is difficult, but doable. Level two looks bitchin'. I say it LOOKS bitchin', because I haven't done it yet, but I think that when I do get to that level, I will already have an a$$ of steal! Level three looks like it is insane, which is what the back of the dvd promises. At any rate, after doing level three, I anticipate being able to break a 7 minute mile, as my legs & butt will be a force with which to be reckoned.

This definitely isn't an all-around/full-body workout (if you're looking for that, get No More Trouble Zones & Blast Fat, Boost Metabolism), but it IS a great workout, perfect for giving anyone the thighs & butts of his/her dreams.",1315440000,162,1587,4.322147651006712
4522892,5,B0051GLDQI,"I'll start by saying that I've never been a fan of workout videos.  I'm 23 years old and realized early this spring that I was not in the type of shape I should be for my age.  So, I started working out at the gym and got less than favorable results.  While shopping around a local Target, I saw Jillian's Shred It with Weights on sale so I decided to give it a go because I love kettlebell training.  I immediately meshed well with her style of training.  After completing that video, I started Ripped In 30 towards the end of July.  With that said I've lost 40 pounds in three months by working with Jillian 5-6 days a week and eating a low carb diet.

I was excited to receive my preorder of the Buns and Thighs DVD yesterday because I had just finished Ripped.  I intend to do this DVD for a month, probably 10 days each level as you would with her Shred video.  Level one was DIFFICULT, but I got through it with ease because I was primed by working with Ripped in 30.  (If you've done this video you'll find a lot of the same moves, with a good mix of new ones.)  I generally mute the dvd and play my iTunes in the background, because I find the music choices in the videos to be a little cheesy and not motivational.  I also find myself in moods where I don't want to hear Jillian blab about random stuff while I'm sweating my butt off.  However, I did complete this dvd without having to mute it this time, which was a great sign.  The music is MUCH better, and Jillian is funny and personable.  She does go on a rant about messages left on her facebook and twitter, but its rather funny.

My one complaint is that Natalie who models for the advanced moves in levels 1&3 tends to slack off (she returns from the original shred video).  She's inspirational to watch because her body is totally sick, but I watched the rest of the levels just to see what I would be in for, and she definitely cheats it out at times.  I understand these moves are incredibly hard, but I'd imagine that someone who's supposed to be advanced could be a little more dedicated to completing sets.  There are times when the beginner model, I think her name is Anita (also from shred), seems to be working harder and with more intensity!  Jillian catches Natalie multiple times and while its not a big deal it didn't go unnoticed.  Note to Jillian---Bring back Basheera!!!

All in all that one criticism is not enough to downgrade the rating.  I'm writing this review with my legs propped up on my couch in pain.  I haven't felt sore in weeks so this is a good sign.  You WILL see results with Jillian but you can't eat back your calories and completely negate the work you put in.  I'd also encourage you to take measurements before you start, because you may find that you only lose 1 or 2 pounds through the process--while dropping 1-2 pant sizes.  Don't live by the scale, and good luck!",1315353600,51,2874,4.303538175046555
4522893,5,B0051GLDQI,"I did Level 1 of the DVD today.  It was a great workout. I definitely feel like it was challenging but fun too. I've Shred it, Shred it with Weights and Ripped in 30days and this one won't let you down either.",1315353600,,209,3.9761904761904763
4522894,5,B0051GLDQI,I have almost every Jillian Michaels workout DVD - they are the best out there!  This one is no different.  I have only done level 1 so far but it was awesome.  It worked the targeted areas but also gave me some cardio and ab work with was a great bonus.  I exercise at least 5 days a week and after this workout I woke up somewhat sore but not unable to move - just enough to to know it's working.  I would reccomend this DVD to anyone with a moderate level of fitness who wants a killer booty!,1315353600,2,495,3.95959595959596
4522895,5,B0051GLDQI,"Jillian never disappoints! I own most of her workout DVDs and LOVE all of them. Her pace is perfect, the level of difficulty is perfect- I love how there are different levels and I love the results! I have noticed results within 1 week each time I start a new Jillian workout...I had a baby last October and have lost 78 pounds doing Jillian's workouts! Needless to say, I am a fan for life!",1315353600,14,391,4.297297297297297
4522896,5,B0051GLDQI,"I am first of all, a huge fan of Jillian Michaels.  I pre-ordered this video and it came in on the release date.  I used it yesterday, and i could only do like half of it!  It's KILLER!  Today, even though I only did about half of the moves, I am definitely sore.  I pair this video with the 6 week 6 pack, afterward, I feel my whole body has had a really good workout.  I only tried level 1, but it still kicked my butt!  She did some great moves, and some were really challenging, but after doing it a few more times I think I will be able to keep up.  It is a bit longer than 30 min, but come on, who couldn't use an extra couple of minutes to have amazing buns!?  The other girls in the video are very likable also.  They have actual personalities!  Its nice to see that they can pick around on each other while still getting a killer workout.

CONCLUSION:  Buy this workout! It is pretty tough, but totally worth it!",1315353600,,921,4.05
4522897,5,B0051GLDQI,"Would there be any doubt that we would receive nothing but a tough workout from our beloved trainer? Yes, she still makes you want to reach through the TV and occasionally give her a smack down (with all the muscles she helped you form) but alas, you keep pouring it into your workout.  I'm an athlete, 43 years old, mostly run trails and circuit train daily (with one rest day) so am in good shape but have room to improve (we all know staying fit is nothing but a ton of WORK - fun WORK.)  I've been looking for something that focuses more on the backside and could barely wait all weekend for my Amazon package to arrive today. Even if you have not been an athlete or if you are trying this as a beginner, just take your time, honor yourself, and follow the beginner in the video. Just stick to it.

This quick review is about workout 1 and 2 and I did them back-to-back tonight.  I may update later w/workout 3 but I just wanted to write quickly to say that Jillian herself says she lies (!) about time - of course (and thankfully so) the workouts are a bit longer than she announces in the beginning.  Lots of plank work, variety of lunges (curtsies), front/side/back kicks, some plyo work, working with the chair (step-up to back lunge), side planks with inner thigh lifts, old school mat work.  In workout II I really loved the single-leg burpees back to plank and then back up to single leg and jump or the single leg squats with corkscrew overhead press with jump.  I was sweating big time in Level I - I wouldn't recommend anyone skip this one because it is a great challenge and of course, with Jillian, you can make it even more intense.  All of this can be paired down to suit your level of ability.  Overall, for first workout, I had 146 avg hr and burned almost 430 calories in 38 min for workout I.  Workout 2 was 475 calories in 38 min. I'm 5'9 and b/t 135 and 140.  Pretty awesome stuff.  It was just about the same for me in workout II but I did peter out a bit at end after long work day and challenging workout so I tapered off in intensity so as not to lose form.

There was an earlier comment that Jillian rags about naysayers on Twitter or whatever but it's just a fleeting comment and it's no big deal, it's the truth. She takes hits for putting herself out there because people can be mean but this video is just rock solid.  The back-up girls are awesome too - prime condition and no messing around.  Nothing to gain attention or distract (minimal ego, which is so refreshing.)  I'm a huge Inside/Out Bob Harper fan (love those cd's - but some of the folks in the background can be distracting.)  The music is familiar, some of the old school mat workout is familiar (think Jane Fonda even, or TA mat work) but it's effective.  Jillian calls herself an ""artiste"" in this one and I believe her - master trainer.

I'd recommend listening to Jillian's podcast.  Check out the 3/11/11 post - first it talks about possible nutrition pitfalls of going vegan (I'm not vegan, but have huge respect) and then there is a section of the talk that refers to how she trains and how much time you have to put in.  All about combo/hybrid lifts, utilizing all muscle groups all at once - it takes at least 20 mins to release hgh hormones.  This is where she calls herself a ""liar"" about time (of course she says it's shorter than it is) and I love her for that.  I'm so excited to just give all of myself to this new dvd and see what happens.  Give yourself a treat and get this one, add it to your arsenal (pun intended.)

Update: Finished Workout 3. It's tough but not as tough as 2 in my opinion.  It seems to have more mat workout - warm-up was kind of slow compared to workout II.  Overall, my avg hr was 143 and burned 385 calories. It just wasn't as intense as I like but i still love it. I think if you're up for challenge combo'ing a few of these like 1 and 3 or 2 and 3 (esp on weekends) would be rocking. You could easily do level III and tag on a run (if you're already in good physical condition.)  I have to say that I'm not sore at all (from any of these) but I still have room to grow/improve/challenge myself but I def feel the booty working and I'm dedicated.  I hope everyone loves this workout too and sees the results you want!  Take care!

Now to enjoy the afterburn.  Cheerio!",1315267200,232,4310,4.250306748466258
4522898,5,B0051GLDQI,"Being the ""maniac"" as Jillian refers to, as soon as I opened the DVD I went straight to level 3.  It was tough enough.  Not too hard, not too easy.  I didn't lose my breath easily and I wasn't dripping in sweat as much as I was with her other workouts.  I was worried I wasn't feeling the burn on the exercises but when she did the fire hydrants and kicks, THAT'S when I felt my butt lol!  Jillian brings back Natalie from 30DS and Anita from Ri30.  Also the setting was a lot different than what she usually does.  At first it looked similar to an animated film/workout to me; but that was just the setting/lights/atmosphere.
