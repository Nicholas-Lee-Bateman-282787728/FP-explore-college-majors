194040,4,1573624160,"A pleasant surprise.  I would recommend it to anyone who looks elsewhere than ""blockbusters"" for entertainment.  The movie pulls you in as you begin to understand the relationships of the characters.  It is about life and therefore disjointed and not fully understandable until the end.  The message will differ depending on the viewers background and perception. But if you see it (the message, that is), then it is there.  If you don't, then it wasn't there for you.",979344000,7,468,4.948717948717949
194041,2,1573624160,"The idea was there.  A film about the change over of Hong Kong from British to PRC rule.  The casting was there too.  Jeremy Irons, Gong-Li,  and Maggie Cheung.  This was a film I looked forward to, understood very  well, but was ultimately disappointed.
The symbolism is great.  The dying  Jeromy Irons represents British rule.  The scarred but always optimistic  Maggie Cheung is the people of Hong Kong.  Again, this was a clever idea  and props to that, but the film often just wanders and drags.
Also  disappointing was Gong-li.  Gong-li is one of the most gifted actresses in  China.  She is fantastic.  However, her poor English really hurts her  performance.  She has given many powerful performances in her native  language and it was painful to watch her struggle in a English film.  Gong-li is great and should not rush to make anymore American films.
So  again the films concept is great but the finished product is a noble  failure.",967248000,8,945,4.76875
194042,5,1573624160,"As with all true masterpieces, you either love or hate this film.  I have read all of the reviews for this film on Amazon.com and IMDB (Internet Movie Database) and one thing stands out:  All of the reviewers either  pointed out what a piece of trash this movie was, or were totally and  completely entralled with it's cinematographic spendor.  I must confess  that I fall into the latter category. I have watched literally thousands of  movies in my life (average of 10 per week) and I have to admit that most of  them have been forgotten.  It is for movies like Chinese Box that I wade  through the endless sea of mediocre and just plain pointless films, on the  off chance that I will find a jewel in the rough.  I feel that Chinese Box  is one of the true jems, I would place it in my top 3 list. For those who  have experienced the truly memorable experiences (both good and bad) that  life can throw at those who REALLY think and care, this movie is for you !  It will dredge all of the past meloncholic feelings out of your  subconscious mind and shatter your everyday demeanor.  I found myself in  tears at the beautiful conclusion of this film, something that only 1 other  movie (Bladerunner) has ever been able to accomplish.  I have never in my  life viewed a motion picture that so perfectly captures the essence of the  human condition. All in all, I would say that this is one of the few films  I will ever watch again and again, and ever time that I view it will bring  exquisite new meaning to this most meaningful piece of art.  No, correct  that, this MASTERPIECE of cinematography.",957657600,39,1601,4.412371134020619
194043,4,1573624160,"I have to say I fell for Gong Li in this film.  This is not Shakespeare in love, this is Jermery Irons in love and hate.  Gong Li was the forbidden women that that poor mr jaded journalist Jermery Irons could have had...  But, he was called away like the British that leave during the film in a  mass of fleeing rats from the ship.  The background to this film is  interesting as the 1997 change over is played out.  Yet Gong Li has played  this character before, or something like it, but here she is able to seduce  the Brit this time.  The poor Brit? No, he is more like the tiger that  hunts the streets that quests for a reason to live.  I was most affectd by  the ending of this film, because I knew what would happen, but I did not  know how the characters would react, hopfully not go and die....",956966400,5,804,4.103225806451613
194044,2,1573624160,"Wayne Wang is just an embarrasement to ""Chinese"" film-makers.
The overall story of Chinese Box is a love-story wrapped around the Chinese and English cultural encounter in Hong Kong around 1997,  but just like Joy Luck Club, it's so full of stereotyping it's terrifying.  I cannot conceive of viewing it as a love story or as a cultural  exposition. Throughout the story, characters who are supposed to have led a  life of exodus or growing, similar to people I see around me daily, are so  bizzare I almost yelled: ""they are not real  people"".
Essentially, I find it very hard not to consider the  cultural aspect, since Wang spend so much time moving around Hong Kong in a  handheld video camera. But his Hong Kong is composed simply of stylish  upper class composing mainly of expatriates and then all lower-class folks,  as if there was nothing in between. And I mean it, there was nothing.  Jeremy Irons' John has close to no HK friends, no social life, and is only  interested in Hong Kong as a dump. He lives in a dump, films the dumps, and  his only other incarnation is a reporter who writes about the economy?  which Wang didn't go sufficiently deeply into. You might say he is just an  eccentric person, but there are enough disturbing scenes of the Hong Kong  society in this movie that worries me, because ultimately John's journey  becomes the reality for people who are not familiar with Hong Kong. I'm  very disturbed with such lack of depth as Paul Theorux is also credited for  story and he has written a lengthy monograph on Hong Kong. If that's Mr  Theorux's Hong Kong, then I'm even more worried. Still, as a Hong Konger, I  cannot help taking this subject matter personally. The Hong Kong, and even  the overall mood of the changeover, is grossly inaccurate, with incorrect  events made solely to terrify the audience, making it a lot less valuable  as a ""Chinese Box"" because it might as well be called  ""Jupiter Box"" and it wouldn't be less funny.
The cultural  essays are also very disturbing. Gong's character is so paper-thin (not her  body shape) you could knock her down with a brush. Here you have a new  immigrant who rise in society using her body, and now owns a bar, again  with no close associates or connections to talk of. Without that life,  which happens in the middle of the story, she could only revert back to  becoming a low-life? And in the end of the story she appears in her full  glory in a high-class event, unexplained. This flip-flopping does not  magics make, just amazement. I have never seen Gong in such an  unchallenging role (acting-wise). To argue for the screenplay, I have to  say the writer may have simplified her life. But, as someone who knows the  Hong Kong society first-hand, first, ""the stigma of her past""  does not ruin her life -- not in Hong Kong, and, second, there are just too  many opportunities in Hong Kong to believe an ex-bar-owner can only lead  the life of a prostitue. I am not about to criticise a writer's artistic  license. However, this is definitely a cultural bias, no less disturbing  then that found in ""Joy Luck Club"". Because, believe it or not,  Chinese women are very strong! You can see that in most of Gong Li's or  Wong Kar-wai's movies.
The cultural bias goes on and on, with a story  around Maggie Cheung whose life is ruined because of a love relationship  with a ex-colonial son. That was just so incredible. I don't think I need  to go into that because everybody knows that's fairy tale, at least  everybody in Hong Kong. Maybe true a long long time ago ...
Ultimately,  it seems that Wang's characters are typically pick out of Hong Kong  melodrama movies in around '50s-'60s, when stereotypical tear-jerkingly sad  characters were very successful. But life just isn't that simple, and I  thought modern day film-makers are already beyond that. Even judging it  merely as a love story, I find it less than interesting, cardboard figures,  with a Western moralistic hero falling head over heel for his Chinese doll,  who couldn't love him, and then have to. God, that's ... that's ... that's  so Wayne Wang, such an embarrassment. And to think he was born in Hong  Kong.
Maybe -- just maybe, if the movie was set in the '20s or '30s Hong  Kong, then it could have been acceptable.
One thing is clear, Wang is  incapable of making movies about places he's never lived in.",950140800,10,4373,4.627118644067797
194045,5,1573624160,"Somewhere I read--I don't even know if it was in relation to this movie--that if you've never loved a woman you couldn't have, you won't understand this movie.  This is a more than reductive introduction. I  can begin by saying that this is one of the most thoughful and intelligent  movies about the new internationalism that I have seen, but that sounds  like a blurb.  Irons is a man whose unconsumatable love for his adopted  Hong Kong is embodied in his love for Gong Li's character, just as gong  Li's character suffers from a love of the west that cannot escape old  collonial cliches of bondage and subordination.  So that's a pretty concise  summary of the ""significance"" of each character, so what?  By  using the romantic metaphor, Wang manages to peel away a layer from our  true international obsessions (at the heart of which is possession) and  gambits.  There are no flattering portraits in this movie: the west tries  to use Asia for a quick buck, while Asia tries to use the west for a type  of legitimacy.  Unfortunately, the actions of the west have estranged it  from itself (Irons being estranged from his family), while the attempts to  embrace the west isolate the Asian from Asia (Gong Li's inability to climb  up the Hong Kong social register).  This is just a scratch.  1000  words can't do this very well done movie (except for the strangely lo-tech  computer graphics title sequence) justice.  You have to think.  The movie's  there, but you have to think.",948067200,23,1485,4.74015748031496
194046,2,1573624160,"Despite a first-rate cast, the movie never really delivers.  Maggie Cheung is interesting as the waif-like June, but Gong Li and Jeremy Irons just can't connect.  In all of their scenes together, I kept wondering whether  Gong Li really understood anything that was was being said between the two;  and her lines (in english) seemed rather ersatz in nature.  If you want to  see what Gong Li is really capable of (and she is capable of quite a bit),  see ""Ju Do"" or ""Farewell My Concubine.""",946339200,5,490,4.627906976744186
194047,4,1573624160,"I say ""quiet"" because, as other reviewers have noted, it was slow. Still, that didn't bother me. I was drawn into it, and if the story itself seemed weak, the characters and setting were not. Jeremy Irons  played the role he plays best -- a man obsessed with one who is  ""forbidden,"" and in this case, it's the city as much as the woman  that draws him. Gong Li and Maggie Cheung both gave memorable performances  as well, and the seduction-scene between Li and Irons is both tender and  titillating. I also want to praise the soundtrack. The sequences by Graeme  Revell, featuring ""Dadawa,"" were haunting and evocative, and I  ended up buying the soundtrack soon after I saw the movie. You may find the  movie dull if you're expecting action or high drama, but its voyeuristic  feel, the underlying love story, and the actors themselves make the film  worthwhile.",936748800,10,864,4.7
194048,4,1573624160,"The three central characters in this film Jeremy Irons (the foreign reporter), Gong Li (the former prostitute), and Maggie Cheung (the scarred street hustler) each represent aspects of the old, Great Britain Hong Kong  and new China Hong Kong.  I think Gong Li and Maggie Cheung, two great  actresses, should have had more screen time.
This film was long and slow,  lacking the traditional rising action, climax, etc.  However, it had a  mysterious quality about it that makes it captivating and gave me a worldly  feeling.  It changes the way you perceive things.",922924800,6,564,4.989247311827957

194091,3,1573624160,"Neither weak and bland nor spectacular, this movie is a little bit touching, a little bit short, a little bit informative (given its setting in Hong Kong right before the handover), and the characters seem real. Hardly anything happens, only a series of changes of heart, and I think that's intentional.

It is worth noting that the premise presented is exactly a premise, the set-up of the action.

A weakness I noticed was that Jeremy Irons' character controls the perspective. This may be intentional, as the viewer can begin to feel the sway of the other characters' wills as John weakens -- sort of a pan out -- but I feel the impact of Vivian's final decision is less felt because of this.

I noticed a French writer, Jean-Claude Carrire, had a hand in the script. He seems to have had a hand in a lot of movies, and may inform a conclusion to someone prone to research that.",1469059200,,881,4.528301886792453

I don't like to be put through the jerky, fuzzy picture experience for nonsensical reasons.

The Jeremy Irons character never had much of an opportunity to be likable at all.  Perhaps he was representing Britain itself, and therefore was not supposed to be likable.  Gong Li, on the other hand, was representing Hong Kong, and in the end the camera panned in on her designer jeans just before she set out to rebuild after the handover.

194592,2,1573624160,"At first I thought the dizzying effects were a poor download from Amazon and then I realized they were the vision of the director. While this settles a bit after a half hour or so, the movie never found any footing and really disappointed me.
Where to start? First, the characters are all hard to like and worse yet, they are ridiculous clich&eacute;s. Jeremy Irons' John is a bitter and cruel man who does not deserve anything but his self-inflicted lonely circumstances. What he does to Jean is downright heartless and his drunken attempts to divulge the background of Vivian deserved a beating. Then we have his callous disconnect with his wife and family. I'm supposed to feel something for this woeful self-absorbed fool?
Next up is Gong Li (who truly needs to find a better agent when it comes to English-language movies - Miami Vice? Hannibal Rising? This?) playing a wretched clich&eacute; of the China doll prostitute. What does she want? What's her story? So many questions that needed answers and I'm given only superficial explanations and disjointed actions. What a waste of one of the finest working actresses in film.
Lastly, we have Maggie Cheung as the deranged street hustler who so captivates John that he goes full stalker on her. What could be her story? It has to be something mysterious and fascinating, right? Wrong again. Yet another waste of talent and character development potential.
These three hollow characters are thus left to try and prop up a weak story full of trite representations and analogies of Hong Kong's change from British rule to Chinese rule. Sure, it's full of great potential but this mess of a movie does it no justice and neither does it do China any justice, either.
The more English language movies I see that attempt to tell Chinese history, the more I crave the movies of Zhang Yimou, Ang Lee, and others who spare us the jaded western anti-heroes, the pathetic eastern stereotypes, and the Geraldo-esque pseudo-exposes of the underbelly of a country that deserves far better than Chinese Box. That a Hong Kong native made this is even more confounding.",1320364800,2,2107,4.871866295264624
194593,4,1573624160,"Wayne Wang's ""The Chinese Box"" was in the budget bin @ our local video store; so I took a chance.  The slow-paced film produces some excellent delights.  Jeremy Irons who won his Oscar for ""Reversal of Fortune"" in 1980 plays John, a British citizen living in Hong Kong right before the turnover of control to the Chinese.  As John, Irons is expressive in an unrequited love for Vivian.  He deals with his serious medical condition and says goodbye to that which he loves most dearly.  Gong Li is elegant as Vivian.  She expresses so much with a look from her eyes.  Li has won four major acting awards which are the Volpi Cup for Best Actress from the Venice International Film Festival for ""The Story of Qiu Ju"" in 1992, a supporting award from the New York Film Critics Circle for ""Farewell My Concubine"" in 1993, Best Actress from the Montreal World Film Festival for ""Piaoliang Mama,"" & a support award in 2005 from the National Board of Review for ""Memoirs of a Geisha.""  Vivian's boyfriend Chang owns a bar & refuses to marry her.  Michael Hui is not the most of attractive of men; so one wonders why Vivian stays in the relationship.  Maggie Cheung won a Best Actress award in 1988 from the Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival for ""Full Moon in New York,"" she won the Silver Bear for Best Actress in 1992 for ""Center Stage"" from the Berlin International Film Festival, was nominated for Best Actress for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hero/dp/B00030590I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hero</a>&nbsp;in 2002 by Hong Kong Film Awards & won the Best Actress award for ""Clean"" from the Cannes Film Festival in 2004.  Neither Gong Li nor Maggie Cheung have ever been nominated for an Oscar, which is surprising.  As Jean, she roams Hong Kong with a walkman, a chip on her shoulder & a prominent facial scar.  As we learn her story, we question her mental stability, but also see how people can live inside their dreams.  It is a powerful performance.  As Jim, Ruben Blades plays guitar and comes to stay with John periodically depending on the ups & downs of his love life.  ""The Chinese Box"" is a slow lyrical film, but I found it moving with great visuals from Hong Kong.  Enjoy!",1221523200,4,2221,4.833333333333333

Vivian is eager to secure her position in Hong Kong society and wants her successful boyfriend Chang to marry her. When Chang proves to be indecisive about their relationship, Vivian turns to John. Giving into their feelings for a brief but passionate affair, they now face inevitable change and unexpected obstacles in this touching and compelling film.""

Nothing else I have seen or read captures the poignant and slightly fevered atmosphere of Hong Kong in the months leading up to the 1997 handover. The relationship between John (Irons) and Vivian (Gong Li), and what we learn of Maggie Cheung's character's past relationship (?) with her schooldays English boyfriend, seem to mirror aspects of the political and cultural relationship between the British and Hong Kong Chinese. The ending is deeply moving.

This film is infinitely superior and almost entirely different in terms of plot, and indeed everything else, from Paul Theroux's disappointing novel, Kowloon Tong, that apparently inspired the makers of this film.",1215993600,11,1195,5.186528497409326

If you choose to waste 99 minutes with a film that is absolutely ridiculous be my guest. How could someone such as Wayne Wang who directed THE JOY LUCK CLUB and actors Gong Li (RAISE THE RED LANTERN) and Jeremy Irons (just about everything for thirty years) have ever held their heads up after this bomb!!! It is obvious that Gong Li was chosen for her crossover fame and NOT her ability to speak English!!! She is given lines such as ""What?"", ""Yes"" and the most important  ""No"". Irons is the same if not worse as in his sex-crazed lover role in LOLITA (which was tons better).

1997 Hong Kong is in the midst of British Colonial Rule ending. What will happen to it's culture,it's society etc. as the Chinese regain rule? If that is the story then something really got lost in translation in this internationally produced debacle. This screenplay is absolutely one of the worst that I have ever sat through.

It is the social commentary part that is laughably atrocious. It should be a crime for a film maker to make up historical events like Mr. Wong did in this film; I am referring to the two scenes of student suicide. For those of us who are well informed, the movie just lost all credibility; for those who aren't, it just added more to social and racial prejudice.  It is beyond artistic license, it is political propaganda! Why oh why Wayne? To appease certain Westerners' stereotypical view of the Chinese? Simply unforgivable!!

194599,1,1573624160,"This film has a good plot (a romance, in a background of change in an exotic place), a great cast (Jeremy Irons, Li Gong, Maggie Cheung), and a well-known director (Wayne Wang, the director of ""The Joy Luck Club""). Notwhitstanding that, ""Chinese box"" falls short of expectations, and can only be defined as a forgettable movie.

In case you are still interested in this film, despite what I have just told you, I will outline the plot for you. The main character is John (Jeremy Irons), a journalist in love with Vivian (Li Gong), a lovely Chinese woman with a shady past that he cannot have. John discovers he is severely ill, and decides to make something in the last few months he has left. He wants to make a documentary regarding Hong Kong, the place where he lives as an expatriate. During his new endeavour, John meets a very troubled young woman (played by Maggie Cheung), and manages to document some of the turmoil that took place in Hong Kong before the Chinese takeover in 1997.

All in all, I regret renting this movie, and I regard the time I spent watching ""Chinese Box"" as lost. Not recommended.

194600,5,1573624160,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE! Sorry, but I have to resort to caps to counter-act all these negative reviews. Wayne Wang is an underrated genius. Sure he's made his fair share of crapola (Maid in Manhattan?), but Joy Luck Club, Center of the World, Smoke, and Chinese Box are all high art as far as I'm concerned. To me this film is about the inability of a westerner to fully understand the east, and more specifically the changing but undying spirit of Hong Kong. Using the british withdrawl from Hong Kong as a backdrop for a story about a dying british man in love with an unattainable Hong Kong woman is an interesting irony by itself.

As far as Gong Li's character being a stereo-typical high-class asian prostitute, and that being a folly of Mr. Wang (as suggested by another review), I think something is being missed. The whole point of her character is that she represents that western (male) fantasty, and is therefore unattainable. Maggie Chueng is the other side of that coin. She is the REAL Hong Kong, although equally elusive. She even has her own ""Jeremey Irons"" (british boyfriend) that is to her unattainable. Get it?

The shots and camera work are unbelievable in this film. The atomosphere is %50 of it. It has an almost cyberpunk quality. The music, especially Dadawa, is awesome aswell. This is a multi-faceted work of art.  By the way, the DVD has some great features!",1125187200,56,1381,4.674897119341564
194601,5,1573624160,I highly recommend this movie to anyone curious about interracial relationships. The movie is set during the handover of Hong Kong from the British to the Chinese.  This movie talks about the love between a Chinese prosititute and a British journalist.  The reality in the movie is very healthy and wonderful.  It shows the relationship between the colonial British and the people in Hong Kong in a very truthful way.  It's definitely a movie for today's culture.  It's a very good movie.,1121126400,6,488,4.902439024390244
194602,5,1573624160,"I first saw this film in Scottsdale, AZ at the local arthouse movie theatre, and it really left me with a feeling. Couldn't immediately put it into words or identify it, but a feeling nonetheless...an impact...a strange sensation. The more time that passed, the more I thought about the film and the more I liked the experiece while watching it. Although I have never been to HK, I believe that Wayne Wang has captured the breath and soul of Hong Kong and the mysteries that it carries. It has put in me, a hope and a dream that one day I can visit this exotic city and breathe in the aroma, the sounds and sights of its vibrant, pulsing atmosphere. Even with Ms. Li's newly budding English skills, this is still a remarkable piece and dazzles with metaphors and rich character-driven fabric. Ruben Blades is a marvelous choice as Iron's ex-pat friend and strums a beautiful song, Across the Borderline. Mr. Wang, if you are listening, this is fine piece of work and I hope that you continue to make these wonderful films that evoke a canvas of feelings and stimulate the senses.",1060905600,7,1079,4.595854922279793
194603,2,1573624160,"'Chinese Box' attracted me through a fairly interesting looking trailer.  I couldn't have been more disappointed with the movie itself.  Jeremy Irons, Ruben Blades, Gong Li - these three characters are somehow close, but they interact as if they're from three separate universes.  They're certainly not helped by the script (what the heck is this about anyway?), Wayne Wang's sloppy direction or his choppy, disjointed storyline.
Gong Li is worthy of particular note.  Perhaps China's greatest working actress, I've gotta think that Wang was so infatuated with the idea of having her in his film that he manufactured a way around her (at the time) very limited English.  Her very few lines have the feel of being pieced together via phonetics.  As a result, the supposed intense relationship between she and Irons' character is real stretch to envision.  It's a real shame that many viewers will get their intro to Gong Li in this fashion.  She deserves far better.",1041465600,5,965,5.0251572327044025
194604,4,1573624160,"Among the crop of Chinese filmmakers known in the US, Wayne Wang is by far the most intellectual. While some of his works were received warmly (say ""Smoke"" and ""Blue in the Face""), many accused Wang of being over sentimental  or even downright exploitative (think ""Joy Luck Club"") .
Picking a place to stand with the film is an interesting position.  For this viewer, ""Chinese Box"" is a fascinating, if flawed piece of ""masterwork"".
Local Chinese in Hong Kong were largely unable to understand the film, citing Wang fabricated facts (such as the demonstration students setting themselves on fire, or the suicide shooting at the club to protest the Chinese Handover) while the whole  affair was  directed at a foreign (international) market.  The gweilos (the expats in Hong Kong) hated it because they were portrayed as arrogant, self-serving prospectors, and there to make a quick buck.
Wang's vision is unique, for the simple fact that this is someone who's brought up in Hong Kong, then migrated to the US. He returned to Hong Kong later on to work for a brief period, but (understandably) left again to continue his career.
Before ""Chinese Box"", Wang made an independent feature ""Life is cheap...but toilet paper is expensive"" and it was a wild rollercoaster ride of the Hong Kong. Cutting and uncompromising, cynical yet laced with touches of poignancy, the film could not have made been made by anyone from Hong Kong.  ""Chinese Box"" is, in many respect, the sequel.  Placed side by side, the two films echo
the scarred history of Hong Kong.
I love ""Chinese Box"" because Wang speaks about the gulfs between East and West that are never acknowledged. It touches on the narrowmindedness of much of  the locals and the expat community.
Wang fabricates some of the facts on the Handover for the simple reason it was a media event.  Truth can be oliberated and fiction can easily be made up and printed. There's a nice bit where the photogenic Gong Li imitates Dietrich on the television, miming and reenacting her stage gestures. The reunion scene between Maggie Cheung and her former school sweetheart is akward and look exceeding uncomfortable on the screen. Yet, it is absolutely spot on and made sense.
Don't watch this film as some piece of  Asian exotica or Orientalist kitsch. Wang's thinking is far ahead of other directors like John Woo or even Ang Lee (much I think highly of Lee). Wang presents a reality of Hong Kong that few dares to admit.",1026864000,12,2454,4.835322195704057
194605,4,1573624160,"Chinese box is a very interesting film. First of all a Wayne Wang film (remember eat a bowl of rice ? a film portrayed the Chinese immigrants life in US and excellent movie smoke  as a result of his cooperation with Auster) that is set in Hong Kong and includes excellent performances by Irons, Li, and Cheung . Secondly it is based on the time period which was extremely important as well as worrying for many Asian people. It marked the end of British rule and unification with China. Film focuses on those days with  an impossible love story between Irons and Li.
Film has full of images and tales about the people of Hong Kong and their way of living, power politics and market scale as well as the difference of eastern and western people in their way of thought and living. Irons' impossible love for Li and her struggle between two man, are represented throughout the film in a different way and thus forcing to make the viewer try to understand or at least make him/her to be as objective as it is possible on making judgements on Asian life. Western people has problems with understanding Asian mind and way of living and unfortunately only very few people really tries to do. As portrayed in Irons character, he tries to understand the people and the city over a decade but fails because in his words everything is changing so fast.(Maybe like many westerners suggest, it is rather a difficult task and since you have the best (!) of it why sweat it ?)
Wang draws the picture of city in one hand a fast moving, modern Asian city full of local and foreign businesscholics. Caught in the middle , on one hand trying to stay as traditional it can be but on the other hand trying to look , live and feel as a western democracy. There are many symbols and signs showing this as fish market, mah jong, family relationships as well as the businessman with mobile phones and blasting western flavoured music, scarred cheung and the running dog prepared to fight by the owner etc. Lions offers a solid performance and Li suceeds to come up with goods as it is her most difficult role so far portraying such an untraditional character. Cheung continues to rise with the young, hip but  a bit of a desperate character.
This movie is not an easy, let's go type of film. As I mentioned, Wang tries to make us understand the way of life, thinking as well as the identity clashes in people who lives in this fascinating neon city. So viewer has to force his/hers mind to de code the symbols and icons which tells a lot to the viewer about the situation.

For instance, two customers drank and talked about the northern girl in a very bad slang. Their attitudes were so rude. They embarrassed Gong Li because she is from the northern part of China. I hope that the audience who watched this film do not have an impression that the Hong Kong people are rude. It is not turth. Generally speaking, most Hong Kong people are polite and conservative.
