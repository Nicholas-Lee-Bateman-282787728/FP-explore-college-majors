8552298,5,B00AIU7LK4,"I had been looking for this concert DVD for a long time here in the US. I am a big fan of the Kassav' and I wanted to see the musicians, at least on a concert. Everything in the DVD is up to the point and I love every second of it. Of course, I would have liked the presence of Patrick St Eloi (PSE) but God decided otherwise (so no PSC song is played in the concert, but that is normal). Besides the regular musicians (Jacob Desvarieux, Jocelyne Beroard, Jean-Claude Naimry, Jean-Philippe Marthely, Pierre Edouard Decimus), you get other incredible musicians in the band, including a horn section out of this world (they don`t do music like that anymore). All the guest stars are very good. This concert DVD is very good. I hope Kassav' will do another concert DVD like that, soon.",1385683200,3,782,4.4375
