5558032,3,B00B58FV82,"Of course there's a hidden lab deep in a jungle, where else would you put one if you were planning to create some HUGE killer wasps.  Naturally, some old dude just had to go poking around in this lab; he soon goes missing requiring his dutiful daughter to search for him.  Enter Corin Nemec as a reluctant tour guide/body guard/bug killer.  He's a soldier with a very small platoon (small body count).  And as if the killer wasps weren't trouble enough, there's also a local guerilla guy with a fondness for stretching out words with ssssssssss in them.  Unfortunately, they let him talk way too much.  He's about as menacing as Elmer Fudd.
The quotient of bug action to human action was way off.  In a sci-fi flick titled Dragon Wasps, you would expect more wasps, less people.  Sadly, this is not the case.  The angry insects are used sparingly and repetitively.  The acting is uniformly subpar, the dialog is yappy and inconsequential, the plot is pretty basic.  There are absolutely no surprises.  Nothing unique is offered but for the title and the promise of some interesting monsters that never really materialize quite in the way they should have.  A bit of a disappointment, it was just barely okay.",1405814400,,1208,4.722488038277512

5558034,1,B00B58FV82,What a total rip-off of a so-called sci-fi film.  Horrible special effects...even more horrifying actine...and a plot that reminds me of a 1940s Tarzan film.  Avoid.  Don't even rent.  Spend those extra 90 minutes watching three old episodes of The Twilight Zone.,1393632000,,263,5.190476190476191
5558035,4,B00B58FV82,I can't help but wonder what all the people who claim to LOVE B-rated movies expect from such movies. Maybe if you're some sort of B movie critic then this might not be for you. But for anybody who knows how to pop one in and enjoy it? This is gold. A few quality one liners for sure and plenty of ridiculousness make this a film worth your time!,1393113600,,346,4.028985507246377

5558037,5,B00B58FV82,"Here's a short and sweet review. Dragon Wasps is a sort of update or re-make of a not-so-classic grade B sci-fi flick called ""The Monster From Green Hell"".

Only the MFGH bugs are extremely laughable to see (and yeah, they are giant bees who move more slowly than a snail) but the acting is even more hilarious.

Watch that one, then watch this one. ""Dragon Wasps"" will show quite a bit of similarity.

Yet both reflect the fears of their time. In the 1950's it was the fear of mutation by atomic radiation. In our time it is the fear of mutation by genetic engineering.

So why 5 stars? Well, Grade B 1950's sci-fi is unforgettable and often goes classic. In 50+ years, maybe this film will be a classic as well.

Also, as silly as the DW movie was... I kind of enjoyed it because it reminded me of MFGH (which impressed me when I was 8 years old)!",1376611200,4,849,4.28125

5558039,3,B00B58FV82,"When her father disappears on an expedition, Gina Humphries and her assistant, Rhonda, set out to search the rain forests of Belize. Due to numerous happenings in the jungle, they are escorted by heavily-armed soldiers. Guerillas, led by Jaguar, ambush them and have a bloody shootout. Then, out of the blue, a horde of Dragon Wasps(massive flying bugs that shoot flame from their abdomens) swarm the soldiers. The military must defeat Jaguar and his bandits & survive the onslaught as they venture inside the Dragon Wasps hive.

I'll admit, with a title like Dragon Wasps & a plot like the above, you'd think this movie would have alot going for it. You'd think it'd, at least, be a fun and exciting movie in a B-movie sort of way. However, Dragon Wasps isn't quite the fun and exciting B-movie you'd expect. It's not a bad movie, mind you. The acting is good and the plot is okay. It's just as another reviewer pointed out..it feels too generic or, as I would say, flat. The wasps aren't menacing or scary at all and, because of that, I feel that's why you yourself can't take the movie so seriously as it's played. With a little better direction, I think this movie could've been pretty good.

As it stands, though, It's an okay movie. A decent time-waster. As far as a purchase goes? I'd give it some thought.",1366934400,4,1313,4.6068376068376065

5558046,4,B00B58FV82,"Classic B Monster movie! it has Corin Nemec in it who also was in Sand Sharks, Robo Croc, Dracano, as well as Mansquito! This guy is quickly climbing my list of favorite actors for his work in these movies

Dragon Wasps is about what most kinds of these movies are about...and to be honest its two words I look for in the description of these movies. ""Genetic Experiment"" typically automatically puts the movie in my cart and this one seriously didn't disappoint. Nobody really of much fame is in this but some might recognize the bad guy from ""Poseidon Rex"" (another most have in my opinion for your crappy monster movie collections.)

Its got a pretty good pace and the animation is actually pretty great as far as these movies go. Its got enough humor to keep it light but not over the top and even mentions ""Sand Sharks"". Its definitely not an academy award winner but its fun and worth the watch

8/10 honestly!",1414368000,,916,4.539393939393939

8562729,4,B00B58FV82,Not too bad for an animal hybrid movie. I thought the effects were a little better than most of these types of films. The acting was hit or miss. I didn't feel cheated out of the hour and a half I spent watching it and would probably watch it again.,1457827200,,249,4.0
8562730,2,B00B58FV82,"You watch this type od movie to see the big bugs or whatever it is.  We get to see the big wasps 2 or 3 times throughout the movie and the rest is dealing with what should be the side story.  So basically, it is a movie of the military fighting drug runners, with occasional big wasps that pester them.  Yawn....",1448496000,,312,4.081967213114754
