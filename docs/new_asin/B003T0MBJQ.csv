8404902,5,B003T0MBJQ,Fantastic on Blu-ray.  Picture quality and audio is great.  Subtitles work nicely.,1485475200,,82,5.75
8404903,2,B003T0MBJQ,"I bought this blu-ray disc last week. Not worth spending $30 with shipping for the blu-ray disc.

Audio quality is poor. I have latest model Bose 5.1 audio system. I tried both the audio options (Uncompressed LPCM, Dolby Digital) which are available with disc.  Audio is coming out only from front speakers all the time.

Video quality is OK, but not worth spending 30 bucks.",1324339200,,375,4.7384615384615385
8404904,5,B003T0MBJQ,The quality of the film is brilliant. I enjoyed every single scene and expression of this film in HD. The movie itself was so good and entertaining as well. Definately worth the money!!,1290988800,,185,4.636363636363637
8404905,5,B003T0MBJQ,"Very impressive, with a large variety of events/scenes (great computer special effects used to re-create ancient times).

This movie had a sense of humor, not always taking itself too seriously, but also had intense/brutal moments (the very first 5 minutes is a very dramatic opening).  I give a lot of credit to the main actor (he was incredible) and the amount of work everyone put into this movie.

For me, it occasionally had a somewhat 'Chinese storyline' feel (even the music, which was very good, sometimes had a Chinese quality to it), which worked out well.  Really enjoyed this clever/developed story and the acting (beautiful scenes).

This is an adult movie due to the battle/fight scenes (not for young family viewing), but highly recommended!!!",1284163200,3,758,5.080645161290323
8404906,5,B003T0MBJQ,"If you like Bollywood movies, you might want to travel south to Tollywood and the world of Telugu language fims. Like Bollywood, Tollywood has its own pantheon of stars and is capable of turning out first class productions. Magadheera is a terrific tale of reincarnation, love and spectacle--and yes, it's chock full of dance numbers. What makes this special is that the film spans two eras: today and the 1600s, however the 1600s here are more mythic in tone--think Prince of Persia. This one of the most fun movies I've seen this year. Oddly, the blu-ray version lacks the extras of the two-disc DVD edition.",1281830400,4,610,4.819047619047619
