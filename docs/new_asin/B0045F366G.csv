8416638,3,B0045F366G,"Clearly a made for TV sci-fi was not on the budget of a current theatrical release or even made for TV special. A fan, of which I am not one, raised on elaborate computer games and mega-movies, will find much lacking in this four episode series highly regarded in its times. Not only was it made in the 70's but it reflects an adult's view of the ""flower children"" generation and the visible breakdown of many conventional norms. Much more generally, though not explicitly, it reflects the rejection of the ""Baby Boom"" generation and its perceived disorderly, anti-middle class behavior reflective of hostility towards the womb from which it emerged. The breakdown of legal order as a consequence of their rejection of moral order is a fundamental theme.
The plot is simple: hordes of mindless flower children are being disintegrated, in masses they form, by some mysterious force. Attempts at negotiation with these forces fail and the earth faces extinction of its young. Professor Quatermass, great scientist, wants only to find his lost granddaughter, presumably, a flower child. There are subsidiary plot-lines but the primary one focuses, first, on social disarray and, second, on saving the earths children.
Sir John Mills role as The Scientist, gradually emerges as the Star of the film, earlier on, Simon MacCorkindale, dominates as the scientist who saves his life, in the face of threats posed by urban gangs and as a married man with two children. For some reason, which never becomes clear, he and his family are identified as religiously practicing Jews. The veteran Mills does as well as the script allows as does MacCorkindale, save for a rather thankless plot line for him in the last segment of the film.
All-in-all, sci-fi fans who are seeing this for the first time, should expect some, greater or lesser, degrees of disappoint. Today, in 2012, is does not appear to be competitive with first rate theatrical or television productions.
Note: As is my custom,  I did not watch the second disc which contains the theatrical release of the series edited to two and one half hours. The other bonus is a History Channel documentary on Stonehenge, which, as you would see in the series and film, has a distinct relationship to the plot.",1325462400,3,2250,4.936675461741425
