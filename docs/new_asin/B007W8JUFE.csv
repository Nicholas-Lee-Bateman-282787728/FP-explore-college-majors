8522435,5,B007W8JUFE,"I've been a Robotech/Macross fan since Robotech first hit US shores. Being very young at the time, my memory was hazy as an adult but I do remember it being an epic and did recall many pivotal scenes. My dad, traveling for work, had even brought home some fighters straight from Japan, as well.

For the past few years I've been collecting up the ""original"" series (as they arrived in the U.S. as Robotech) and the later Japan only Macross works. This ranks well with me, as does ""Plus"" and ""Zero"" as must haves. Frontier is great. While the storyline is not completely original it is well done, well animated, and the production quality is excellent.

There are some quirks. As mentioned by others, during a few episodes the captions are translated rather poorly and aren't timed perfectly. It is still easily understood. On my example the picture quality was perfect. On the main character having been a famous Kabuki star, strange as it is, it fits the storyline well, as he struggles to find a place among seasoned pilots as well as earn respect from his friends.

Unlike many Robotech works, the sound effects, songs, and musical score are great. While things sometimes feel rushed, it is 25 episodes and if it was 100 I doubt many would want to own or watch such a set.

The additional movies that were included with the set were not worth watching. The alternate story lines were not well done or thought out, the additional songs added nothing to the experience, and the translation was terrible. It almost feels as though there was additional footage and ideas that they didn't want wasted, and it was rushed into something. It was a waste of time and an aggravation to watch.

Overall it was a great story with a lot of action, included some interesting characters, and my purchase was timed well as the price was within reason of a regular purchase and not an inflated ""collectors"" price. Excellent.",1395532800,,1910,4.6895522388059705
8522436,3,B007W8JUFE,"i watched this show when it was online,the subtitles were much better(they hade better spelling too)and as another reviewer said there was something wrong eith the color,it looks washed out compared to when it first came online.  Also when i got my dvds i thought they gave me a differant show because it had a differant picture on the disk,it wasn't until i put it in my player when it was the right show fyi it it happened to u",1371513600,4,429,4.3625
8522437,2,B007W8JUFE,"I might sound old, but for me the true standard for a Maccross series is the original one from the 80's. The story had complexity, it was realistic, and the element of a love triangle in times of conflict added a lot to the story. After that, I enjoyed Macross Plus very much as well, because of its originality and attention to detail.

I stopped watching the rest of the Macross series, sorely disappointed as they became more standard, unimaginative anime like many other, but by chance I watched the first couple of episodes of Macross Frontier and I regained hope. Quirky as it is (like most anime), it has a lot going for it: the mecha, while not very original, is very well animated and the battles are exciting; they new enemy, the Vajra, is also pretty original. But they threw it all away by introducing very strange details to the story (spoiler alert) like flashbacks of Alto appearing suddenly as a Kabuki actor, dressed as a woman, for now particular reason. Realism is the least of their priorities in the way the use the Macross as a very movable robot (as if there were not people and vehicles, etc., inside it suffering from the acceleration of the enormous ship), and frankly the story is very generic and just goes too fast, without enough argument to convince you of what they're pitching to you.

Now, storyline quality aside, the subtitles are terrible: it's like they just used google translate and threw it in without a second thought. Especially in the movies disc. You can understand what they mean, especially if you've seen enough anime in your life and kind of have a feel for how the japanese language works, but it is offensive that so little care was taken in the production of a $35.00 disc set. The series is there in youtube to watch for free (in HD quality, too), with a much better translation by FANS, for crying out loud!

In conclusion, I liked many of the battle scenes and there are a few original elements in the plot, but with the poor storyline and the low translation quality it is definitely not worth the price. I guess there will never be another Macross like the original one.",1370044800,2,2127,4.57742782152231
8522438,2,B007W8JUFE,"Macross Frontier is a great series, and should be an addition to any Macross Fan.

Unfortunately for this product the picture quality is terrible and the subtitles is off in later episodes, appearing too quickly and out of sync with the characters. The songs are central to the series but are either sometimes missing of mixed in with the dialog. For something that came out years ago (it came out in 2008), you would think they would have made a decent box set by now.

Foreign companies take too long either voicing over or licensing and then over charge it when it comes over to the USA. It is disappointing. But make no mistake Macross Frontier is a homage/salute to the entire Macross series and is worth watching, but you'll have to wait for a good version to come out. I have bought two versions, one without  the movie (last year) and one with the movies (this year), hoping they changed. Don't be fooled buy the picture you see on Amazon, they didn't even change the box art.

The movie was only slightly better in the way of subtitles.

Alot of the anime that has either the Chinese/English subtitles are a hit or miss, they either get it right, or they totally messed up.",1361232000,8,1182,4.5046728971962615
