I do not believe that I've received one decent video in the last four I've bought be they dog training or how to learn automotive pin-striping, they all have had something terrible wrong with them. Bad sound, bad picture or a combination thereof.

Well, this is my last attempt at buying on-line, any sort of training/learning video. It's just too much a pain in the A#% to return them...",1157932800,,443,4.594936708860759
8654542,5,B00000JN45,"This video is great.  I used it for training my German Wirehaired Pointer.  Janet Nahorn demonstrates simple no BS techniques for training a hunting dog.  She starts from a pup and works through the dog's first year.  If you follow her method, you will have a solid hunting dog.",1061683200,,278,4.612244897959184
8654543,5,B00000JN45,"This video presents a sensible, humane way to help your puppy develop into a great hunting dog and companion.  Janet Nahorn's method of bringing a puppy along is a departure from the harsh, demanding approach many trainers  advocated in the past. (Some still do.) She takes advantage of the puppy's  natural desires and she uses those desires to help the puppy think for  itself.  They really ""get it"" when you use Ms. Nahorn's training  method.  With this method you will find yourself with a bright, intelligent  dog who will be a true friend and hunting partner that you can enjoy being  around.  I have trained a number of dogs and I only wish this method had  been available from the start.  My current puppy is being trained with this  gentle, progressive approach and he's really coming along well.  You will  not be disappointed if you get this video and try Janet Nahorn's teaching  method.",960163200,18,899,4.740259740259741
8654544,5,B00000JN45,My dog has been trained using the simple techniques in this video and the results have been nothing short of amazing! I am by no means an experienced trainer but you wouldn't know it when you see the way my dog works. The  training was easy and I will never use anything else ever again. I can't  thank the folks at Mason Creek enough for taking the difficulty and  confusion out of training a great hunting dog!,958867200,11,412,4.324675324675325
