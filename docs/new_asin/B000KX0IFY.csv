8159518,5,B000KX0IFY,"Great movie - the action shots are well done.  I very much enjoyed the variety of locations, especially the freestyle exposition that took place in Red Square, Russia.

Amazing riders.

Most of the action takes place on natural steep mountain slopes, not ramps.  This is a much better way to view the riders' skill and technique.

Best of all, the soundtrack did not give me a headache.  Most of the sled DVDs out there feature songs by unknown bands who basically play three cords and yell alot.

The music was certainly not ""tame"".  The songs reflected the spirit of the sport and the riders.

In my opinion this is one of the best sledder DVDs on the market.",1193875200,,661,4.533898305084746
8159519,4,B000KX0IFY,"Great sled action, high production value, and they have removed all the ramp jump garbage for the other video.  This is yet another solid video from the Slednecks franchise.  I would recommend it without hesitation to all sledheads out there looking for a fix while waiting for the snow to fall.  Man, they should hire me for PR :)",1167091200,,331,4.576271186440678
