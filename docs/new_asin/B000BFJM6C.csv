All are original.  After all, anything beats another Hollywood comic book sequel, right?  And you have to give these film-makers credit for trying to do something different.  If you enjoy  this, then please check out Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation.",1225238400,,442,4.905405405405405
8086082,4,B000BFJM6C,"I have never seen a Tromadance DVD before this one, so I was not quite sure what to expect. I thought it would be mostly indie horror movies similar to the troma brand. It appears to be a selection of various independent films, not specifically horror, but all are mostly weird and funny.

Le Bagman was a really well done troma type horror movie. Lots of guts and gore. The Dubya and Nosferatu: The friendly vampire were funny. My favorite was Teenage Bikini Vampire. Lick-it Man and Johnson 2: The passion of the Johnson were longer movies with some humorous parts. The passion of the Kingdom Rebels was a great cartoon. In all the DVD contains 15 movies that run about 2 hours, 45 minutes. DVD extras include Directing Lloyd, Tromadance 2005 PSA, Make your own damn movie! Lesson (really good segment), Webmonkey's Bananas, and Parts from the Family trailer.

Overall, there are some good movies here and none that are really bad. I just ordered one of the other volumes, but I'm not sure how this one stacks up against the others right now. All the money from the DVD goes back into Tromadance, so at least your supporting independent filmmakers with your purchase. I think most troma fans will enjoy this DVD.",1146787200,,1214,4.668224299065421
8086083,4,B000BFJM6C,"I'm not going to go in depth, like I did with volume 3 (I don't think I have the strength), but I will say this is a really great collection of offbeat short films -- comparable in quality and variety to volume 3 (some online reviews I've read argue that volume 1 is still the best -- these people don't know what they're talking about).

Some highlights include LE BAGMAN, the first film, which is quintessentially Tromatic (an eensy weensy bit of plot and TONS and TONS of hilariously ridiculous homemade gore); EMILY, about meeting your in-laws and killing to make them happy; JOHNSON 2: THE PASSION OF THE JOHNSON, a hilariously dopey detective parody; and the AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE-ish cartoon THE PASSION OF THE KINGDOM REBELS.  There are actually many more I'm not mentioning, but just discover them for yourself.

In his amusing introduction at the start of the DVD, Troma president Lloyd Kaufman talks from the set of his upcoming film POULTRYGEIST and claims (jokingly?) that volume 4 is the best Tromadance collection ever, so there won't be a volume 5.  Considering the combined merit of volumes 3 and 4, I suspect volume 5 would have a lot more goodness, so let's hope it's not true.",1130803200,3,1197,4.712918660287081
