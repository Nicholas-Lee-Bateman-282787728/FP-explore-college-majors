8603189,4,B000GBI3GQ,"This movie is far fetched in terms of plot so step back, suspend reality and enjoy. `Crash' has dreams, and these are pivotal to the story. Carried along by fate, `Crash' cares about the people his ambulance scrapes off the streets. The victims of life sometimes don't make it, and this becomes brutality evident. The movie ends up being I think, life affirming and optimistic (without being sentimental).

The young actors do a fantastic job, and it is an empathy for their characters that makes this an enjoyable film. Matthias Schweighofer does a great job as `Crash'. Jessica Schwartz is wonderful, she was a very brave young woman to do a nude sex scene whilst nearly 9 months pregnant. Jessica was also the prostitute, killed for her sent in the movie `Perfume'. So, this is a bit strange and quirky, and it didn't work for me all the way through, but I thought it was memorable",1232841600,,884,4.666666666666667
