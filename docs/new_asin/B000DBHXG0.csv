2474783,3,B000DBHXG0,"Zathura propels the audience and two squabbling siblings into deep space while playing a mysterious board game. The live-action film is based on Chris Van Allsburg's 2002 follow-up to his award-winning Jumanji. Brothers Danny and Walter's combative relationship is established immediately along with a four-letter word, which is more jarring given the young age of the film's target audience. Zathura is rated PG, but considering the overall family tone of the film, the line is awkward at best. Tim Robbins plays the inefficient dad who appears only long enough to leave Danny and Walter in the problematic care of the sleeping older sister.  After this not-entirely, unnecessary, initial exposition the movie is remarkably fast-paced leaving little need to think too hard about the physics or lackthereof. One cool effect is followed another as the brothers take their turns to make matters worse, one card after the next, just like Jumanji and its movie adaptation.  And like Jumanji there is an adult who shows up in the form of an astronaut, played by Dax Shephard, to help end the game before the house is entirely wrecked by the barrage of black holes and bad robots. The astronauts presence, not only gives the parents a character to connect too, but creates a much more interesting dynamic between the brothers. The game itself is nicely sci-fi retro, as are the sci-fi scenarios, the art direction and the music.

A mostly harmless family film which looks as pretty as Chris Van Allsburg's artwork (too bad he didn't add color to HIS Zathura).

 Watch for the ""Citizen Kane"" homage in the alien ship.",1131753600,7,1610,4.992537313432836
2474784,4,B000DBHXG0,"Yes, it does have the same basic premise as Jumanji (both books were written by the same guy, after all!)-- board game wreaks havoc on innocent children who happen to have a few problems other than an insane board game. But Zathura is about 100 times better. First of all, the characters aren't overshadowed by 1) huge special effects and 2)big name actors who take over the movie. This is a movie with heart, and a great way to start the holiday season, I might add. Remember how surprisingly good the fun, holiday movie Elf was? This is like that, and both are directed by Jon Favreau. This film does a marvelous job of making an implausible situation seem plausible, while giving the characters some realness.

Two young boys, Walter (age 10) and Danny (age 6) are constantly fighting. Danny just wants someone to play with. Walter could care less. Their father (played by Tim Robbins) is newly divorced, which only adds to this family's stress. There's also an older sister, Lisa, who sleeps until 2 pm and doesn't care about anyone but herself. When Danny finds a mysterious game in the basement called Zathura, he begs Walter to play. Walter doesn't feel like it, so Danny begins to play anyway. On his first spin, the game spits out a card that reads, ""Meteor Shower. Take evasive action."" Danny can't really read, and it's not until their living room is being pelleted with meteors that the boys take evasive action. Danny runs in circles screaming. Eventually, when the house if floating in the middle of space, they rescue a stranded astronaut (played wonderfully by Dax Shephard!), who reveals that he also once played the game and that's why he's a stranded astronaut. There's actually a twist in this movie about the astronaut, which I totally didn't see coming. I had to explain it to my little cousins because they didn't really get it, but they still thought it was cool.

In the words of a three year old movie critic prodigy, this movie is ""really really cool, kinda scary, but really cool."" She even said it was better than Jumanji! And if you can't take my word for it, take hers. This is a very sweet movie that explores not only the far reaches of space, but the relationship that siblings have with one another. Very good and PERFECT for kids (except a couple swear words, nothing to really worry about though), I HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND this movie!!",1131667200,86,2373,4.6746411483253585
2474785,3,B000DBHXG0,"This was a space odyssey game for astronomers as most of the action takes place out there in space among the planets, stars, meteor showers, and black holes.  Two squabbling brothers go on a space adventure, courtesy of Zathura, an old-fashioned board game.  It is one of those ""be careful what you wish for"" moral stories and shows that, sometimes, small is better.

Danny, the younger brother, is never satisfied and is forever needing attention.  These children (an older sister is on board) are the products of a broken home, and it shows in their mis-behavior and discontent with the hand fate dealt them.  Walter is the most maladjusted as he foolishly blames the youngster for the parents' breakup.

As the house floats around in space, reminiscent to Dorothy's house there in the tornado which lands in Oz, they run into a destructive, defective robot, some metal lizard men, and goats with multiple eyes.  All misfits.  As the astronaut teaches them, there are some games you simply cannot play alone, and that once started you must finish this game.  This is 'a move forward to the future,' as the past is relived, and the moral of the story is to appreciate what you have and value those you love.  Walter is prevented from making the wrong 'wish.'

Even though the family home is completely destroyed out in space, it is magically restored after the robot is reprogrammed, the astronaut from the future eats a 'dagwood' sandwich, and the harried dad returns from his urgent errand to hand them over to their mother for a four-day week.

This might be a little too scary (even with the gerbil) for smaller children, but pre-teens should have a good time with the subliminal experiences and violence all adolescents feel when frustrated with uncaring parents and authority figures.  ""Jumanji"" director, Jon Favreau, did wonders with Chris Van Allsburg's fantasy game come to fulfillment, better than his original jungle adventure.",1131667200,8,1940,4.932307692307693

2474970,4,B000DBHXG0,"Zathura is a great book-to-film adaptation to come out in this past decade. The idea of a board game coming to life has always been a fun idea to bring to life. First done with Jumanji we now have Zathura. Zathura successfully ponders many tensions in our daily lives, such as sibling rivalry. The two brothers in this film are very dysfunctional and are both full of pure hatred for one another.  Don't worry, there is a fantastically satisfying ending. The divorce of the parents had destroyed the relationship between the two. The little brother is always living in his brother's shadow. Desperately trying to get his father to be proud of him. Zathura offers a engaging story with a great balance of everything. The special effects are extremely believable and the sets and props are outstanding. They definitely look alien for sure. The film offers some brilliant photography and dazzling lighting. Suspense is abundant in this film, so I don't recommend the movie for younger kids. Many life and death situations happen in this film, this can be scary at times. This was a first for a couple stars that today, are now some of the biggest names on the silver screen.

2474975,4,B000DBHXG0,"In 1995 the movie ""Jumanji"" came out, based on a story by Chris Van Allsburg about two children playing a board game that came to life.  When it became fairly successful, another short story of Van Allsburg in the same theme was turned into a movie.  This was ""Zathura"".  Whereas the Jumanji game centered around an African jungle safari, the setting of Zathura was rocket ships in outer space.  Despite the nature of the board game, the movie ""Zathura"" is of the ""fantasy"" genre, not science fiction; the idea of children being magically transported into the universe of a board game is fantasy, and the universe depicted is a fantasized version of outer space that isn't intended to match reality (more on that later).  Zathura was generally well-received by critics but tanked at the box office.  However, despite the lack of success or of the star-power names its predecessor had, Zathura is actually the better movie.  It is less pretentious than Jumanji, and similar to Pixar movies is packaged with a nice little moral (in this case regarding sibling rivalry) that is not horribly overdone.  It also has surprisingly good special effects, much better than Jumanji's.  The ""Zathura"" board game that the children find has a graphic style that looks like the covers of 1950's science-fiction pulp magazines.  When the boys get launched into ""outer space"", instead of making the environment look like a REAL spaceflight the movie brings the campy 1950s-look of the board game to life and makes it quite realistic.  ""Sibling rivalry"" was a prophetic theme for this movie, considering its older brother was a successful movie whereas this one sank in the theaters without making a ripple.  Nonetheless, Zathura is the movie I'd watch again.",1313884800,2,1741,4.986159169550173

I found it a really good sci-fi movie. A lot of non-stop action. A boy finds an old game in the basement and once the game is started it must be finished to completion. This game takes the boys on an outer space adventure, a story line teaches the brothers they need to learn to get along and work together to get home.",1310428800,,489,3.989795918367347
2474978,4,B000DBHXG0,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.

This movie was very similar to the Jumanji Blu-Ray.  Both are presented in 1.85:1 aspect ratio (no black bars at the top and bottom), both have excellent DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 sound (great surround and sub-woofer bass), both are about 1 hour and 37 minutes long, both are about board games which affect reality, both with great special effects, and both with not-so-great video quality.

I give the audio a 10.0, but the video only 8.0, maybe 8.5.  I had to make sure the blue light was on on my Blu-Ray player (Sony's do this when playing a Blu-Ray disc), but realized since I was hearing DTS-HD Master Audio, I did have the Blu-Ray disc in, and not the DVD, which is included in the case.  I just didn't think the video quality was great, like it should be on a Blu-Ray disc.

If you've read some of my other reviews, and noticed these two movies' video quality being inconsistent, I recently watched a regular DVD in my Blu-Ray player, and thought it looked pretty good.  These two movies are not much better, if at all.
Zathura might be a little better than Jumanji (video quality).

This was my first time watchint Zathura, and I thought it was pretty good.",1310342400,2,1266,4.517543859649122
2474979,5,B000DBHXG0,"I went into this movie at first not expecting much, and if you look at it on paper that's exactly how it seems. This observation starts changing with each new scene in the movie opening up a very pleasant experience all around. Zathura is a spiritual sequel/remake of Jumanji, and aside from the whole story being based on playing a board game there are almost no similarities between the two. That being said Zathura is a great film about sibling rivalry and bonding that unfolds in an ever-expanding universe of imagination and wonder. It's a family film best suited for young adults and young at heart.

Here's the plot. Two brothers decide to play an old wind up board game found in the basement. Every time they come to an event on the game it comes to life. This being a sci-fi game those events come in the forms of a rampaging robot, menacing aliens, a wayward astronaut, meteor storms and other sorts of mayhem that systematically trash their house and challenge the brothers to outrun or out-think their way out of every situation. In the process the brothers build a stronger connection with each other that ends with a very satisfying, even if ultimately stereotypical, happy ending.

The story is laid out in such a way where the viewer is learning new things as the plot moves forward. The set up of the characters and their lives, playing Zathura, finding solutions on the way. All of this is done in a way that empathizes with the point of view of the kids. Notice I didn't say ""through their eyes"". This isn't a movie trying to pander to younger audiences with goofy gimmicks. The storytelling is mature while at the same time very accessible. As an aside this story just isn't evolving around the family. There is a universe that unfolds from the game that resonates more than just being various creatures and events to build excitement. It comes out as a living, breathing entity of itself that feels like it will go on long after the boys finish with their game.

At its core this movie is a science fiction film, and the imagination put behind that element on Zathura is really nice. Since the game itself seems to be from the 50's era the robots and spaceships in the film have that nostalgic and classic sci-fi look. If you like the Flash Gordon/Buck Rogers look back in that day you will love this homage to the style. The alien baddies on the film, the Zorgons, are a pretty well developed concept with the creatures having a bit of depth in it more so than just a generic bad guy. They also are the coolest looking reptile alien I have seen.

The special effects for this movie are beyond excellent. Director Jon Favreau (of Iron Man fame) decided to use as much practical effects as possible and the end result is so visceral and tangible that it shames all of those movies who opt for pure CGI for their effects. Real walls come tumbling down. The rocketships and embattled house in space are real models. The explosions and flames are real. The Zorgons (designed by legendary Stan Winston in fact) have real actors in them along with animatronics. When you see a robot running in a kitchen knocking down dishes it's really a guy in a bulky costume slipping all over the floor and tearing up real props. Sure computer effects are used to touch up that robot and add digital backdrops. This amount of tactile interaction makes what you see feel a lot more real. It makes all the difference.

The acting is impressive and shows some real keen strategy in the casting. The youngest kid (played by Jonah Bobo) has the big eyed wonder that moms melt for and had that underdog demeanor that all younger brothers feel at one time or another. The older brother (played by Josh Hutcherson) is a classic ""boy too old to be a kid and young to be a man yet trying to reach that plateau"". Both child actors play off their parts with a kind of conviction to the part that impresses me when I see it in adult actors. They are playing kids with kid's complicated lives, and you believe that to the hilt. Then you have their sister (played by Kristen Stewart of Twilight fame). Her time on the screen is not as long as the brothers, but her interaction with them as the teenage sister sells the performance of that complicated relationship a teen would have with younger siblings. The only other main role was the astronaut (Dax Shepard). Dax plays the part with a natural and casual demeanor that says he's used to being in the middle of all the craziness. In other words the acting is as well produced as the special effects and story in my book.

Zathura didn't do too well in the box office with a lot of people dismissing it as Jumanji without the star power. More the pity, as this movie to me feels like it's much better than Jumanji's special effects-laden showcase, yet many didn't get a chance to experience that. Now you can get the movie on a Blu-Ray and DVD combo pack, and it includes all of the great special features found on the DVD along with an exclusive extra. Visually I don't think you can get any better on this sort of film. The details from the live action and models really come out. This BD-50 disk (announced region free) is packed with language options with a DTS-HD English 5.1 master audio track and 5.1 Dolby Digital in five languages (Spanish, French, Japanese, Portugese and Thai). Subtitles are in all these languages plus Chinese (traditional Mandarin I think), Korean, Dutch, Indonesian and Arabic. Here are the features:

Audio Commentary - With director Jon Favreau and producer Peter Billingsley. They have really good chemistry on this commentary and you get a score of interesting information as well as some entertaining banter.

The Right Moves: The Making of Zathura - Goes over the book the movie is based on and how the production wished to honor that book. They also go over the human aspect of the film and in capturing that element in the story.

Race to the Black Planet: A Visual Effects Documentary - This is a really cool making of featurette that shows how they did all of those practical effects I was talking about as well as the CGI and digital elements of the film. You get to see some cool pre-production footage and how they tweaked it in post production.

The Cast - Actor profiles and their comments on making the film. Some cute anecdotes like how Bobo was loosing his baby teeth during filming and they had to get a bridge made for him.

Zorgons, Robots and Frozen Lisa - A featurette on Stan Winston and his company's contributions to the movie.

Making the Game - A little documentary on the game Zathura and what thoughts went behind designing it.

Miniatures - Remember when I said they used miniatures for the spaceships and exteriors of the house in space? Well here you get to see those efforts and get some insight on why they were the best choice.

The World of Chris Van Allsburg - Kind of a tribute to the author of the book the movie is based on. It goes through a little biography of Van Allsburg.

Race Through Space: Virtual Board Game - This is a Blu-Ray exclusive. While all the other featurettes will be on both Blu-Ray and DVD this one is only on the BD. This is a two player game where you race to beat your opponent on a digital board game by answering film related trivia questions.

Zathura is a grossly under-appreciated film that has gotten lots of good feedback from people who saw it, but unfortunately not many people actually did. Sci-fi fans, with families or without, do yourself a favor and get this flick. The Blu-Ray has a lot of great extras and will likely look awesome on top of that.",1308182400,17,7597,4.542397660818714

2474984,5,B000DBHXG0,"Like Joe Dante, who directed the 1985 sci-fi flick ""Explorers,"" John Favreau understands exactly what it is about sci-fi that tickles the imaginations of kids. Both directors ground their adventures in the familiar setting of home -- a neighborhood, a house -- and both directors show a talent for remembering what it's like to be a kid in awe, presenting everything from the point of view of the boys as they stumble through unlikely space adventures.

This movie is perfectly paced, the kids play their parts with convincing emotion and the dialogue is often hilarious. Zathura is a movie about a magical board game that brings aliens and space ships to life, but it's also about siblings pulling together and discovering their love for each other even if they don't always get along.

There are very funny moments here, like one scene that plays on the absurdity of an astronaut who lands on a house floating in space and still offers the courtesy of ringing the doorbell. The comedic timing is absolutely perfect. But there are also warm scenes, showing what another reviewer described as ""a movie with a heart,"" which is a great way to put it.

Favreau makes it just as easy for adults to feel the same thrill at the prospect of a space adventure as the younger audience. And like Joe Dante, who paid homage to the sci-fi classics of the 50s with ""Explorers,"" Favreau gives those films a nod visually with the retro ships of the alien villians and a malicious robot that's straight out of early comic books.

This was a great release for the Christmas season and I could see it becoming a seasonal classic for families. I caught this movie with my brother -- we're both in our 20s -- and my mom during a week when my brother was on a rare leave from an overseas military station, and it was a great way to spend a family afternoon. It's safe to say that if you have young kids, they'll love it too.",1142640000,2,1903,4.555555555555555
2474985,4,B000DBHXG0,"Once `Jumanji' brought us an adventure story in deep jungle (deep jungle in your house, to be precise). Now its updated version `Zathura' arrives, which is about a `space adventure' by two brothers Walter and Danny. The boys are stranded in the outer space (with unsuspecting sister in her room) after starting the game of the film's title. To go back to the Earth alive, they have to finish the game, pushing the red `GO' button, one player after the other. Unfortunately, however, Walter and Danny are not always co-operative, both having a quarrel with each other.

Yes, `Zathura' is about an old game found in the basement in the brothers' house, and Danny accidentally becomes the first player of it. Unlike `Jumanji' in which wild animals of the jungle rush into your living room, the game of `Zathura' transports the entire house into the outer space, where many life-threatening events happen to the brothers. After the rather weak initial 15 minutes which introduce the family (including their father Tim Robbins, and sister Kristen Stewart), `Zathura' keeps entertaining us like a roller coaster despite some slack moments.

Though the appearance of Tim Robbins is too short, which is little better than a cameo, Dax Shepard provides a good support as a stranded astronaut, who is probably better than the over-the-top Robin Williams in 'Jumanji'. The two child actors Josh Hutcherson and Jonah Bobo are also good, though I find some part of their acting (especially when quarrelling) is irritating and overdone.

`Zathura''s simple premise is based on the book of the same title, beautifully illustrated one by Chris Van Allsburg (`The Polar Express' and of course, `Jumanji'). And the story resembles those of them - children learning a precious thing or two about family or life itself after the incredible and imaginative adventures set in another world. Some viewers would complain, perhaps with good reasons, that the script of `Zathura' (by David Koepp and John Kamps) recycles some elements from `Jumaji.' I understand, but you know, both of the films are based on the same concept - kids playing a potentially deadly board game - so let's ignore the resemblance. And the predictability of the `game' should also be forgiven because, as you know, all the games of this type will end in only one way.

You may not praise actor-turned-director Jon Favreau for inventiveness and originality, but it must be said too that he succeeds in imbuing the old-fashioned feeling into the film, which, in spite of plot holes and some unnecessary slapsticks, turns out a delightful, well-told tale for children and adults alike. The film is greatly helped by the first-rate CGIs, but the real charms of `Zathura' are its touch of the good old sci-fi films in the 50s. Don't expect `Star Wars: Episode III' here; `Zathura' is like one upgraded version of the original TV `Star Trek,' sometimes corny but ultimately joyful and optimistic adventure story.",1134172800,2,2956,5.026530612244898
2474986,5,B000DBHXG0,"Well unless you have been living under a rock for the past year or so, you must know that Zathura is a sequel to the movie ""Jumanji."" Basically, if you liked Jumanji, you will like Zathura. It has the same plot, very simular characters and story line.

However, I enjoyed Zathura a little more than Jumanji. Maybe it was the space aliens who look like dragon-men, or maybe it was the meteor shower barraging the living room of the house where Zathura takes place.

It's one of those movies that makes you start thinking, ""What would I do in this situation?"" As you watch the characters fall out of the frying pan and into the fire again and again. Despite some tense situations, none of the characters are actually hurt, so it's just clean fun. Some bad language is used but all in all a great movie for little kids.",1133049600,,816,4.433333333333334
2474987,5,B000DBHXG0,"So I'm 14. Not the brand of person to go and see such a movie for my own gratification; it really was one of those 'well, it's the only thing playing...' sort of deals; like you were almost FORCED to go via ennui.

I would have NEVER comprehended sitting through Zathura at the edge of my seat, encouraging and cheering the siblings and the stranded Astronaut on with every ounce of oomph I could (I might have been screaming it out loud too...) rally, laughing out loud at Danny's charming personality and loving the benevolence maturity of Walter as the film progressed. The action is exhilarating for the kids and prudently done for the parents and a tale that redefines BRILLIANCE and, dare I saw, overtakes the area of Jumonji and all its glory. Zathura is not only a thriller with a plethora of feat and battle, but also a case in point of siblinghood and collaboration shown in such a way it's sure to be super glued to your memory. More than just a film, it's an exemplar for all disagreements of family, clearly not only by telling but SHOWING you that it really does take two; or three and possibly even four hundreds. The numbers could matter less; it's the moral behind the turn of the key and the little tin rocket ships on the board game.

A brilliant film with a three dimensional story for the entire family, young, old, my age, whatever, I command that you see it with anyone you can find. They don't want to go? Drag them blood, tooth and nail into the theater by their legs if you must. It's worth every scratch, every penny and every single moment.

I'm seeing it for the third time tomorrow.

Heh, I'm insane, I know.",1132963200,3,1638,4.45
2474988,4,B000DBHXG0,"Zathura bears a striking similarity to Jumanji.  This is not shocking, considering that both were originally novels written by the same author, Chris Van Allsburg.  The principal difference here is that Zathura is a board game about outer space, and as the two brothers who are at the center of the film begin to play the game, their house ends up in space.

The strength of this movie is that it depends almost entirely on two young but very talented actors to carry it through its one hour and fifty minute ride.  The two young men are quite engaging, and give convincing depth to the big brother/little brother relationship.  They are joined along the way by an astronaut and their older teenage sister, who has little to do but does just fine doing it.

The effects work here is nice.  In the CG age, it's hard to note anything as being a standout, but outer space here is vast and beautiful, and the 'destructive' effects are a little scary.

As Zathura reaches its third act, the story bogs down.  There is some sentimentality and predictability, but on the whole there is great fun to be had here.  This movie is ok for kids who are not overly sensitive to frightening images.  Final grade: B",1132531200,,1199,4.55607476635514
2474989,5,B000DBHXG0,"Zathura

During the first half of Zathura, I was thinking of subtracting one star for this review due to scientific flaws.  Destination Moon, made over 50 years ago, was more accurate.  However, by the end the story was so good it gets 5 stars anyway.

It's about two brothers who find an old game, Zathura, in the basement, and when they play it, like in the same author's ""Jumanji,"" things start to happen.  A game card warns of a meteor shower, and real meteors breech the roof of the house.  It turns out once they started playing, the whole house has been displaced into outer space, and they have to finish the game to get back, even if it brings on horrendous aliens and other grave dangers.  It's more than just ""Jumanji In Space"" though, with some family lessons as good as, but different from that earlier film.

The most glaring mistakes are:  One, when the house enters a gravity field.  We see things falling off shelves all over the house, and pieces falling off the outside of the house.  You don't have to be a science student; anyone who reads sci-fi (Heinlein, Clarke, etc.) knows that the house would fall at the same rate as everything in it and there would be no relative motion.  Furthermore, in the next scene there are still some dishes on the shelves to rattle and fall.  Two, they set a couch on fire and push it out into space, where it continues buring with visible yellow flames as it floats away.  Of course there's no oxygen in space and nothing would burn in that manner even if supplied with oxygen.  All that's really a shame because the movie could have had some educational value if they'd bothered to get some facts right.

I guess you just have to take it as a children's fantasy instead of serious SF, and as such it's an exceptionally good movie.",1132358400,2,1786,4.4829721362229105
2474990,2,B000DBHXG0,"I had no idea that Chris Van Allsburg had written Zathura.  When I saw the trailer for Zathura and heard ""from the world of Jumanji"" being advertised, I figured it was just the movie studio trying to reap more money out of Chris Van Allsburg's Jumanji.  When I got to the theatre, I was plesantly suprised to see that it was actually based on a book that Chris Van Allsburg had written.

The movie started out with overly done bickering brothers who seemed to be bickering for a bit too long by the time the game of Zathura was found in the basement.  In this beginning part of the movie, I was very suprised at two words that were written to come out of a 10 year old's mouth.  It was unexpected and unnecessary.

The bickering brothers began playing Zathura and realized that they were in outer space after meteors destroy their living room after the first move of the game.  They go and open the door and see that they are floating through an asteroid belt somewhere in outer space, but yet they could breath perfectly, and there was normal earth gravity for the majority of the movie, unless you spit off of the porch, and then the spit would float away.  Each move of the board brought something new, whether it be a malfunctioning robot voiced by Frank Oz (voice of Yoda, Miss Piggy), picking up a stranded astronaught that has been drifting through space for the past 15 years after first playing Zathura, or being attacked by Zorgons.  Speaking of Zorgons, was it just me, or were Zorgons a tribute to a few different movies?  When searching the house, the Zorgons reminded me a whole lot of the raptors from the Jurassic Park movies.  Their ships looked like ships from classic sci-fi movies, but without really thinking about it, it dawned on me that they look a WHOLE lot like the Natalus from 20,000 leagues under the sea, and then in the Zorgon ship itself, there was the tribute to Citizen Kane.  It wasn't exactly Rosebud, but close enough.  I see I'm not the only amazon reviewer that spotted that, but I have a feeling that most people completely missed that.

Overall, the movie didn't have an original enough story.  It was just Jumanji all over again, only this time in space and with a much smaller (and less famous) cast.  The language and intense scenes did seem way too much for a PG movie as well.  It could have easily been rated PG-13 in my opinion...",1132012800,,2378,4.493023255813953
2474991,4,B000DBHXG0,"Danny (Jonah Bobo), seven years old, and Walter (Josh Hutcherson), ten, are left in the care of their older sister, Lisa (Kirsten Stewart). Dad (Tim Robbins) asks her to keep an eye on them as he runs to the office to pick up something for an upcoming meeting.  Being the teenager she is, she promptly goes back to sleep. Walter wants to watch baseball on TV, avoiding his younger brother. When Danny proves to be too much of a pest, Walter chases him throughout the house. He finds Danny hiding in the old dumb waiter and lowers him into the basement. Danny finds his way to the stairs and notices an old board game hiding between the wooden steps. ""Zathura, a Space Adventure for Two Players"". Danny excitedly shows the game to Walter who ignores him. Danny opens the box and turns the key on the board, causing a button to pop out. He presses the button. His spaceship is moved mechanically across the board. A card pops out. It reads ""Meteor Shower. Take Evasive Action."" Danny can't read the card and shows Walter. Walter looks at the card and explains what it means just as meteors begin to destroy the living room. They soon realize that their house is floating in outer space. The only way home? To complete the game.

""Zathura"", directed by Jon Favreau (""Elf"", ""Made"", ""Swingers""), is based on a Chris Van Allsburg book, the same children's book author behind ""Jumanji"" and ""The Polar Express"".

A well-crafted film suitable for the whole family, ""Zathura"" is a delight.

The story is involving and interesting and effectively brings us into the lives of these children. As Danny and Walter run around the house, getting on each others nerves, they seem entirely realistic; two young boys, stuck inside, bored, on a Saturday afternoon. What else would they do except annoy each other, get into mischief and make various attempts to play together? As soon as they find the game, the story really kicks into gear. They realize that they have to play the game through to the end, to get their house back to its small lot in Pasadena and for everything to return to normal. As they play the game, they realize that they have to work together to overcome the challenges of Zathura.

""Jumanji"" had a similar premise, but ""Zathura"" is a very different film. The first film seemed overflowing with characters and animals. ""Zathura"" takes a different approach, telling the story of the two brothers and a couple of visitors who help out through the course of the story. Because of this, ""Zathura"" seems more manageable, more intimate. The first film had Robin Williams' antics, but this new film seems better, more enjoyable, more like a real adventure.

Each card popping out of the machine signals the beginning of a new part of the adventure, a new challenge. Some of these put the two boys in dangerous situations that only strengthen the bond between them, others provide some comic relief. An early card reads ""Player enters cryogenic sleep chamber. For next five turns."" Lisa (Stewart), still not realizing that the house is floating through space walks into her bathroom, concerned that she will be late for her date, and instantly freezes solid. The two boys don't know what to do, except to keep her safe until that action has expired. Another card reads ""Rescue Abandoned Astronaut"". At that very moment, an astronaut (Dax Shepard, TV's ""Punked"") flies by the front door. After they rescue him, he proves particularly useful during the remaining challenges.

When you were a kid, you most likely played games or with toys, imagining they were real and you were actually interacting with them. ""Zathura"" brilliantly captures this feeling, taking it to a new level. Two little boys who were playing a real board game would probably interact in the same way. If one of the players started imagining something a little scary, the other would either encourage him to keep going, to become stronger, or help him through the challenge. The two brothers do this throughout. As various parts of the house are demolished by a robot, heat seeking aliens, and meteors, they scramble to keep the board game, their ticket home, intact.

Director Jon Favreau does a great job at the helm. From the beautiful house, a million plus dollar Arts and Crafts home that dad (Robbins) says he is fixing up, to the look and feel of the board game, Favreau has a definite and unique style. Much like in ""Elf"", Favreau likes everything to seem a little retro. In ""Zathura"", the board game graphics and design appear to have been plucked out of the Fifties. A robot, looking more like something from ""Forbidden Planet"" than ""Star Wars Episode III"", makes an appearance. It actually looks like some of the special effects were created the old fashioned way, with models and miniature, rather than excessive CGI, lending the film a charm many parents should appreciate.

Favreau also does a nice job with the actors. The two brothers are great. Funny and entirely believable, they could live in any house on your street. Kirsten Stewart is also very funny as Lisa, the typical teenage girl. And Dax Stewart does a nice job as the slightly charismatic astronaut.

""Zathura"" is that rare live action film good for the entire family. Kids will love it and adults will enjoy watching it. A couple of the scenes are probably too scary for some of the youngest children. Children Danny's age, under 7, will probably find the film too scary. But everyone else should have a great time playing ""Zathura"".",1132012800,2,5478,4.787301587301587
2474992,4,B000DBHXG0,"I took my 5 1/2 year-old nephew, a kindergartener, to see ""Zathura"".  I expected Michael, as someone who's been exposed to a steady diet of Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers, and Spider-Man, as well as to Peanuts, the Wiggles and the Muppets, to enjoy the sci-fi elements.  Predictably, he spent the second half of the film cowering in his seat, latched onto both of my arms... and he walked out of the theater at the end loving every minute of it, completely jazzed about the experience.  We spent most of the 10-minute walk back talking about outer space, aliens, and how it was all fiction, and he drew a lot of pictures of aliens (most of whom looked like Muppets) once he got home.

As others here have said, the language used by the two boys in the movie (10 and 7) is a little disconcerting.  However, they use the same words I was exposed to at that age, and comparable to the language Michael is exposed to at home.  Michael didn't walk out of the theater cursing, so that part of the movie did not bother me.

The scare factor is somewhat intense.  The predictable monsters don't show up until the final two reels and aren't what I'd call terrifying, although that's the part of the movie that had Michael cowering.  There's also a big clunky '50s-style robot, but when you find out who provides the voice you'll realize that this wasn't meant to be terrifying -- not if anything to say about it Jon Favreau had.  The images of the house floating through space, alongside asteroids and suns, is what will really stand out for the younger viewer.

This is basically a kids' movie directed by Jon Favreau, so naturally it's going to seem odd.  Based on the uncomfortably short shorts worn by the teenage girl in the movie (and she has nothing else to do at all), I'd say the target audience is boys 9 to 12.  There's also a surprisingly deep plot twist involving another game player that the boys meet as their house drifts through space.  I had trouble explaining that to my nephew, although his grandmother didn't understand it either.

My final verdict is that it's safe to take a smaller child (6-ish) to this movie, and they will not take anything negative away from the experience.  It's no loss if you make them wait another three years before seeing it, though.",1131840000,72,2272,4.545454545454546
