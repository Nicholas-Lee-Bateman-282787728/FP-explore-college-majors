8058310,3,B0009837JE,"I was intrigued by Wash Day after reading disparate reviews about it. One reviewer thought it was a cinematic triumph; another poster opined it was the silliest thing he's ever seen. My opinion: it may be both.

Apparently, a ""beautiful young girl"" (the famous Jenny Petersen of a series of similar films) has her bedroom right outdoors in the backyard, with a vanity, dresser, bed, and a bathtub. We see the girl try on a variety of outfits, stripping naked several times as she models panties, little skirts, sundresses, and tight jeans in front of a mirror. She then takes a very brief nap before washing out some clothes and hanging them out to dry. After her chores, the young lady feels sweaty and grubby and seeks solace in her bathtub, conveniently outside and hooked up with running water. Later, she cuddles up with a Harry Potter novel on a swing, while daydreaming and giggling to herself.

The girl's lovely form is revealed to the viewer slowly: it takes a while to get from shots of her back and backside to full-frontal nudity.  In my opinion, the girl is at her loveliest and sexiest when she's wiggling around in her blue jeans and when she's standing up in the tub using the shower head.

Who or what exactly is this beautiful creature? A forest sprite? An exhibitionist? A self-absorbed narcissist? At the beginning of the film when she's trying on clothes in front of her mirror, the girl seems to be vamping for her own pleasure, like a menarcheal, insecure little thing wondering if she's pretty enough. And does she know she has an audience? Are we as viewers voyeurs intruding on this innocent's private world, or does she want us to come in and drink our fill?

If one can get past the inherent silliness of the premise, the film is actually charming. It has no real story, very little plot. It does have a sweet young blonde, who is naked, absolutely gorgeous, and endearing in an offbeat sort of way. It's not a cinematic masterpiece, but it's a harmless and pleasurable way to spend 45 minutes.",1229904000,2,2023,4.639664804469274

8058313,3,B0009837JE,"Wouldn't consider this to be an artistic movie. Just an opportunity to

show a fairly attractive model in various stages of undress. Jenny is

worth the expense. Natural body in her early 20's. Hokey backyard

set though, so it doesn't have an expensive filming budget. Wish I had

a girfriend like her.",1143849600,10,303,4.769230769230769
8058314,3,B0009837JE,"The Idea was good. I thought this would be more euro. Should of had more than one girl. There wasn't as much full frontal as you would have expected. Just a few scenes in the tub. These movies are bought for the nudity, at least they should put some in it",1128816000,23,255,4.019607843137255
