8150272,3,B000JGG9NM,This is what should be playing if you own/run a bjj/grappling school.  I really didn't find it that useful for much more but it's still a cool video.,1210464000,,149,4.321428571428571
8150273,3,B000JGG9NM,"Having watched some impressive grappling highlight videos on Youtube and Google video, I bought this DVD in search of more of the same when someone recommended it to me on an Internet forum. I was disappointed.

This DVD advertises that it ""takes you around the planet to the toughest competitions, featuring some of the top competitors in the sport today"". However, by and large it is just American tournaments such as Grappler's quest - certainly not the toughest competitions. There are no mundials, no ADCC, I'm not even sure the PAN-Ams were on here (haven't watched it in a while). There are some good competitors, but many are notably absent: Marcelo Garcia, Ronaldo  Jacare, Roger Gracie, etc. Most of the grapplers will be people you've never heard of, often blue belts and purple belts. At least two thirds of the submissions were not really highlight worthy. When a big name grappler or fighter appears, often it's clear that they are being shown just so the authors can put a big name on the outside of the DVD box. This is apparent because the submission is often unimpressive e.g. a basic armbar from the mount, or it is performed improperly.

The soundtrack is 100% hip-hop, often with an ""I'm going to kill you"" flavor which unfortunately reflects the mentality of a large portion of U.S. grapplers. If that's your thing, then you may like the soundtrack. I found it grating.

Basically if you're a novice grappler this DVD *may* have enough educational and entertainment value to justify the purchase. Experienced grapplers should stay away, however, as a majority of the highlights are basic techniques and unimpressive.",1168646400,2,1638,4.945454545454545
