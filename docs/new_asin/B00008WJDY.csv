1865852,5,B00008WJDY,"I love this film.  I am not a Mormon.  I am a Catholic.  I have great respect for the Mormon faith because of their values.  Though, true, this film is historically inaccurate, the production values are first rate!  It is true that the Mormons were run out of every town they tried to settle in.  It is beyond reproach the way these people were treated just because ""they were Mormons"".  The cinematography is superb!!  The musical score in unforgettable and the acting is excellent, particularly Vincent Price as Joseph Smith.  Jane Darwell has another memorable mother role as Eliza Kent.  The struggles portrayed during their pioneering movement is inspiring and edifying.  The DVD transfer is excellent and there are some nice extras in here namely, a great commentary and an A&E biography of Linda Darnell.  Truly a great, inspirational film, no matter what your faith is!!",1123545600,21,878,4.938356164383562
1865853,2,B00008WJDY,"I was disappointed with the way the movie portrayed Brigham Young as being unsure about whether he was the Prophet or not.  From what I know about the history of the Church, he was very self confident and forthright.",1122422400,,216,4.538461538461538
1865854,5,B00008WJDY,"This movie is not historically accurate, so it's important to watch the movie twice and listen to James D'Arc's comments during one viewing of the movie. He explains which scenes are for drama and why they were shown that way. He explains the true account of the trek west. In fact, I felt that his comments were far more valuable than the movie itself. The cricket scene is especially moving as he tells how the people in the scene were not acting when they fought those crickets. It was horrible and some did not think it was worth the money to be in that scene. However, as in the historical account of the Mormon Crickets, the seagulls came to their rescue after a prayer for help was said. Even though the movie is not completely accurate, it's still a touching drama.",1101513600,18,773,4.48936170212766

Oh, and the movie has a young Vincent Price in the early parts playing an important role until his character is killed.  He is a good guy in this movie.",1438992000,,384,3.810126582278481

1865862,4,B00008WJDY,"This little-known black-and-white biopic tells the story of the Mormon migration to Utahwhy it happened and what followed it.  In 1844, Joseph Smith (Vincent Price) has been head of the Mormon Church since he founded it in 1830, but other Christians have strongly resisted the idea that any collection of writings outside the Bible should be considered equal to it, and they doubt that God would single out an ordinary person like the roughly-hewn Smiththe son of a struggling farmerto receive new revelation.  The sect has been forced to migrate from New York State, its original home, to Kirtland, Ohio, then to Independence, Missouri, meeting with hostility in both places, and at last to Illinois, where it bought a tract of bogland on the banks of the Mississippi (on the reasonable theory that no one else was likely to want it) and there built a town called Nauvoo.  After five years the Mormons have become prosperous, but the jealousy and hostility of mainstream Christians is again rising.  One night a band of local citizens attacks the home of the Mormon Kent family, which is entertaining some neighbors, including Gentiles Zina Webb (Linda Darnell) and her father.  Mr. Webb is mistaken for a Mormon and shot while releasing the horses from the barn, which, with the house, the raiders fire; and Mr. Kent is tied to a tree and whipped to death, leaving his son Jonathan (Tyrone Power) and wife Liza (Jane Darwell) in charge of the three younger children.  Though Smith has never wanted anything but to be left in peace, and is willing to do the same in return, he sees that his people must defend themselves.  But when they try to, Smith is arrested and tried for treason, and despite the eloquent defense of his disciple Young (Dean Jagger), hes put in the local jail, where that night another mob breaks in and shoots him.

Despite counterclaims from Angus Duncan (Brian Donleavy), Young now declares that he is the man the Lord has chosen to lead the church.  Duncan, unable to dislodge him, makes a deal with the Gentiles of Carthage, or at least tries to: he and his followers will be allowed to stay on unmolested, while Young and his will be driven out.  Young, getting word of the plan from a sympathetic Army officer (Russell Simpson, who himself played a Mormon in John Fords Wagonmaster), determines to flee, and the Mormons, in a sequence anticipating the flight of the Jews from Egypt in Charlton Hestons Ten Commandments, surge out of Nauvoo by foot, horse, wagon and cart, abandoning fields, houses, and businesses, taking with them only what they can carry (including their printing press and the bell from the Temple cupola) and just getting across the iced-over Mississippi before the mob can follow them.  With them go the Kents and Zina, whom the family has offered sanctuary until she can decide what to do in the wake of her fathers murder.

What nobody except, perhaps, his wife Mary Ann (Mary Astor), suspects is that Young isn't at all sure the Lord has really nominated him for the post hes assumed.  Still, motivated by the responsibility for thousands of lives, he does his best, leading the Mormon caravan across Iowa to Council Bluffs, where the Indians welcome them, and there establishing a sort of halfway station where most of the people will stay long enough to raise a years crop before following himself and his advance party further west.  Duncan urges that they go to California, but on the way through the mountains Young receives a visiona revelation, as the Mormons call itthat shows him a broad valley just ahead.  This is the place, he says.

Pooling all their food for the winter, the Mormons begin building houses, laying out an irrigation system, and planting winter wheat.  Sent back East to carry messages to the Council Bluffs settlement, Jonathan Kent and Porter Rockwell (John Carradine in long hair and braids, with two pistols at his belt) return to find the infant Salt Lake City in the grip of near famine: most of the stored food has been eaten, and Kents little sister and brother are reduced to eating grubs like the local Indians, while Zina, who has been giving them most of her rations, is nearly dead of starvation.  Furious, Kent confronts Young and says hes taking his household on to California as soon as Zina is strong enough to go.  Then a cloud of crickets (locusts or grasshoppers) descend on the fields of young wheat.  The Mormons attack them with shovels and brooms, but there are too manythe hills are black with them.  And then a miracle: thousands of seagulls appear and begin gobbling up crickets right and left.  Maybe words like we use, says Mrs. Young, aren't [Gods] kind of language at all.

There are a few historical inaccuracies (not only Joseph but his brother Hyrum were shot in their cell by a mob; Nauvoos charter was revoked, but it wasn't burned, and the Mormons didn't have to clear out by dark of night; nobody (except possibly some Indians) knew there was gold in California till 1848; the Mormon Church didn't publicly admit to its doctrine of polygamy until the 50s), but not as many as most cinematic biographies of the time suffer from.  The costumes and guns are particularly authentic, and oxen are shown hauling manyof the Mormon wagons, something most movies don't do.  Power, though obviously intended as the romantic lead, doesnt have a lot to do, which will disappoint viewers who like his work, but Jagger is quite effective in his part, making Brigham Young seem human and sympathetic.",1436313600,,5506,4.788806758183738

1865864,3,B00008WJDY,"This is a better than average movie of the early history of the Mormons.  However, being a student of Mormon history, there are two historical details which are heavily dramatized in the movie. To begin with,  the Mormons were not violently forced out of Nauvoo as depicted.  The Mormons had already experienced quite a lot of that in both Missouri and Illinois particularly when the governor of Missouri, Lilburn Boggs, ordered their extermination.  As a Jew, I can certainly sympathize from an historical point of view how tragic it all was.  They were certainly ""encouraged"" by their non-Mormon neighbors to depart.  But the church agreed to leave at the urging of the Illinois authorities and agreed to leave that following spring after Joseph Smith's assassination.  Additionally, Brigham Young did not agonize over taking control of the church.  He simply stepped up to the plate and convinced the church members to vote for him.  It was all rather pedestrian!  Anyway, if you like history, you'll find this interesting, but, if you're really interested in Mormon history in particular.......read about it!",1433289600,,1112,5.162011173184357

1865877,5,B00008WJDY,"Vincent Price is  hardly mentioned, but he does a masterful performance playing the role of Joseph Smith.
This movie is about the first two decades of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
The movie was apparently done by Hollywood Jews and Gentiles.
It appears the LDS Church had nothing to do with it.
Nevertheless, it makes a better case for the Church than anything anybody ever did, including the Church itself!
It is remarkable in its fairness, honesty, and historical accuracy, with minimal dramatic license.
For what it sets out to do, it is an absolute masterpiece!
Practically all histories of the settlement of the West are conspicuous for their blatant omission of the pioneering of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
This movie is a rare exception by gently calling attention to the real driving force that made settlement of the United States possible, albeit in a very muted way.",1398902400,,919,4.929032258064516

1865882,3,B00008WJDY,"Very entertaining, in a sagebrush oater kind of way, but tends to be vague on Mormon theology and cultural practices.  Why does everyone hate the Mormons so much: you really don't get much of a sense of the passion behind the outbursts, of what it was in this religion that would drive people to rampage against it, beyond gut-level bigotry.  There's some talk about polygamy, but nobody is ever shown with more than one wife.  Vincent Price particularly good as Joseph Smith: too bad he didn't have more to work with. Spoiler alert: the seagulls win in the end.",1380844800,,562,4.656565656565657

1865884,3,B00008WJDY,The movie would have better had the producers done a little more research on the lives of Brigham Young and Joseph Smith and what really happened to the Mormons in the 1800s.  There were too many inaccuracies in the movie.,1372377600,,222,4.55

1865887,3,B00008WJDY,This movie mainly was the story of Brigham Young.  The Mormans faced angry mobs and were forced  to move several times.  The story shows how they suffered and died during their pursuit to get settled in Utah.,1367107200,,208,4.5675675675675675
1865888,4,B00008WJDY,"I have very little knowledge or awareness of the Morman faith so I really enjoyed this movie. Whilst the story theme is necessarily simplistic to accommodate its telling within the confines of a movie script, it allows an ignorant viewer to gain a basic & very shallow understanding of the historic background in the formation of the Morman faith & I personally enjoyed that.
The direction is adequate with some scenes over acted with the Director trying to emphasise a particular situation however overall it is a good movie & well worth the effort to watch.
I was impressed with Karl Malden's characterisation of Brigham Young & I also enjoyed Vincent Prices brief performance in his portrayal of Joseph Smith however Tyrone Power was a little disappointing for me & I am a fan of his.
Finally, DVD quality was good & it arrived on time so no problems with the service.",1364860800,,871,4.7368421052631575

But if I rated it as a movie I would rate it very high because as a movie it was excellent. I allready had gotten this Dvd a few years back and was hoping they had COLORIZED it and seeing it said COLOR instead of BLACK AND WHITE I quickly purchased it. As far as the picture plot and speed of shipping I was very happy but very disapointed IT WAS NOT IN COLOR. Hopefully someone will COLORIZE Brigham Young soon and I will re buy it. I will keep this one I just purchased so it will be used for a future gift for someone this christmas and the only loss was my expectations.

1865893,5,B00008WJDY,"First of all I'm a Christian-Lutheran and I thought this movie was pretty good, even though I don't know much about the history about the Mormons. I got this movie not for the history per-say but because I'm a huge fan of old movies despite of what they are about.

This movie stars; Dean Jagger, Tyrone Power, Linda Darnell, Brian Donlevy, Jane Darwell, John Carradine, Mary Astor, Marc Lawrence, Vincent Price, plus others. The movies runs for about 112 min (1hr 52min), is in black&white and is in full frame. This movie was directed by one of the best directors during the 50s-70s, Henry Hathaway who directed a lot of John Wayne films.

Overall this was a good movie and I would recommend it to anyone. If you like Hathaway's movies then I recommend seeing this one.",1344729600,3,771,4.62043795620438
1865894,5,B00008WJDY,"This film tells the story of the Mormon exodus to the west in the face of unremitting persecution, seen through the eyes of a participant (Tyrone Power). Dean Jagger plays a good Brigham Young, if perhaps a little less forceful than the real one, while Vincent Price is an excellent Joseph Smith.

Hollywood being Hollywood, there are places where dramatic effect is allowed to take precedence over historical accuracy. In particular, the murder of Joseph Smith is shown as coming after a jury has been terrorised by the mob into finding him guilty, when in fact it came before any trial could take place, so that the entire courtroom scene is fictitious. This, of course, was precisely why Joseph's enemies lynched him rather than permitting the law to take its course. They knew they could not convict him of anything serious enough to end his career.

Polygamy is not altogether ignored, but on the whole is rather played down, with only one of Brigham's wives appearing on screen, though the existence of others is mentioned. Presumably, going further than that would have been inappropriate for Hollywood family entertainment.

Later, Brigham Young is shown as leading the Saints across the frozen Mississippi (true thus far) just one jump ahead of the mob, and they all look back to see Nauvoo burning behind them. In fact, the evacuation took place over more than six months, with Brigham leading the first party out in February 1846, and the last not going until September. As far as I know, the City of Nauvoo was never burned (though the Temple was) but just gradually looted after its abandonment. It is however true that the Saints remained subject to vicious attacks long after they were clearly in process of leaving, and posed no possible threat or danger to anyone.

The hardships of the Pioneer Trail are well portrayed, and, perhaps in a sign of changing attitudes, the Indians are shown in an entirely favourable light. The film ends on a really dramatic note, when the Saints are fighting desperately to save their first harvest from the crickets, and are saved at the last minute as the crickets in turn are eaten by seagulls. I understand that the cast had to perform this scene for real, there being no way to fake it with the special effects available in 1940, and found it every bit as unpleasant as it probably was first time round.

All in all, an excellent movie portrayal of one of the greatest pioneer epics of the American West. Shame it's only available in Region 1, as it deserves a wider audience. Still, multi region players aren't too expensive these days. Enjoy it.",1341187200,4,2602,4.78619153674833
1865895,5,B00008WJDY,"This movie reflects a lot of the persecution that actually happened to the people of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  It is not exact, but close.  The movie is well worth having in your movie library, however, the recording that Amazon sells will not play on all DVD Players!  The recording I received will only play on a DVD player that plays recorded DVD's.  I was disappointed that it will not play on any DVD player.",1335139200,,437,4.425
1865896,5,B00008WJDY,"I watched this movie this afternoon and for a movie of 1939 - 1940 I was very impressed and liked it a great deal.  Although it is not historically accurate, i.e., the trial of Joseph Smith which never took place, Brigham Young's closing arguement never took place because he was in Boston when Joseph Smith was murdered.  The scenes of Carthage Jail were at times very close to the real jail, however, the movie did not protray the murder as it should have.  It shows the mob barging in, then shooting Joseph Smith, when in reality, Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith and their other companions fought back trying to keep the mob at bay.  Hyrum Smith was Shot in the face and John Taylor was wounded.  Joseph was shot from both withing the room and from the ground.  He did fall through the window to the ground below.  Also, before the trial, Joseph Smith never said the saints were not going to leave and they would not turn the cheek anymore.  Joseph Smith was charge with destroying a printing press and was charged with treason.  The printing press was ordered destroyed by the town council for printing false information about the church.  He and his brother Hyrum left Nauvoo for their safety, but many of the Saints lost faith and critized Joseph for leaving.  So he returned to face his trail.  He and his brother traveled to Carthage with the promise from the Illinois Governor he would be protected.  Joseph and a small number of his friends traveled to Carthage without armed escort and turned himself in.  Joseph Smith never received a trail, nor was he protected as promised, nor was he legally convicted of any crime.  A blood thirsty mob of over 100 (against four) stormed the jail and murdered two people without their due process of law.  The Nauvoo Legion was in exsistence at the time and the Carthage town was affraid the legion would attack, but it never did.  The movie depicts the Mormons leaving right away, but in reallity, it was two years later.  Brigham Young was not the Prophet at the time and many other leaders tried to envolk their status as the next Prophet.  Brigham Young was the president of the quorium of the twelve aposoles.  Sidney Rigdon felt he should be the next leader of the church and tried to persuade the saints to follow him, but it was Brigham Young they chose after a serman he gave where many of the saints saw the face of Joseph Smith in the face of Brigham Young.  Three of the Aposoles did not follow Brigham Young.  One of the comments on this movie was that Joseph Smith had appointed his son, Joseph Smith Jr., to be the next prophet which has been a topic of debate since the death of Joseph Smith.  As stated, Sydney Rigdon believed he was the next prophet.  Joseph Smith Jr., never accepted his status as prophet of the ""Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,"" and only after three years after his father's death did he accept the position of Prophet of the ""Reorganized Church of Latter Day Saint,"" now known as the ""Community of Christ.""  Brigham Young did organize several treks from Nauvoo to the Salt Lake Valley.  He was the leader at the time, but never was sustained as Prophet of the Church until several years after arriving in the Salt Lake Valley.  One of the commenters about this movie said the reason for the Mormons being driven from every community they leaved in was because they were a law unto themselves, they counterfieted money, they lured young underage girls into polygamous marriages and a life time of slavery.  The Mormons had vast arsenals of weapons and they threatened everyone who disagreed with them.  This Commenter also mentioned the ""Mountain Meadows Massacre"" and so called public whipping ordered by Brigham Young.  I've never heard of the Mormons being a law unto themselves, although they may have kept to themselves as much as they could after being persecuted and  having their homes destroyed, property stolen, women raped, and men and children murdered.  I would like to say to this commenter to read the Twelth Article of Faith which states ""We believe in obeying the law of the land.""  The mormons believed in this even as they traveled to the Salt Lake Valley, when the Government of the United States, Who failed to protect them from Mobs who violated their Constitutional rights, asked them to form a Battalion during the Mexican War.  Many of the Saints were against doing so, but Brigham Young said it was the right thing to do.  As far as the counterfiet money, the Church as well as many other communities organised their own banking system.  As in all banks, people put their money in and the bank invest it and pays interest to its customers.  The Church did print money as did other banks for the purpose of their own use as many of the communities would not trade with them.  However, the banking system in that day failed and was one of the worst situations during the time.  The Church and it's customers lost money as did several banks not LDS.  Several Members blamed Joseph Smith because he promised if they remained faithful and obeyed the commandments of God, they would be protected.  But many of the saints did not follow Joseph Smith's council.  Polygamy was practiced during the time and is mentioned twice in the movie, but only suttle.  It is not true the women were treated as slaves and they were never forced into the marriage.  Less than 3% of the church practiced Polygamy and did so because it was a commandment of God, (from the book Brigham Young and His Wives).  If people believe in the King James Version of the Bible, which LDS people do, then one would read of several polygamy incidents where God commanded and accepted his children practicing it.  As for the arsenal of weapons.  Well probably true as communities of that time period formed Malitias to protect themselves, so the LDS people were not alone in this practice.  ""Mountain Meadow Massacre"" did happen and shouldn't have, but the entire church was not to blame just as the entire communities of Palmyra, Kirkland Ohio, Independence, Hauns Mill, and Far West Missioui, and eventually Nauvoo Illinois were not to blame.  One must realize that in 1857 Utah was at War with the United States and a U.S. Army was coming to invade.  Many LDS people were scared and upset, believing they were going to be driven out of their homes again.  Brigham Young ordered the Saints not to bother the wagon train of people passing through Utah, but the ones in Mountain Meadows didn't listen and the incident happened.  But that doesn't mean the entire church should be to blame.  Now back to the movie.  Although not historically accurate, it is an outstanding movie with a few historical events.  If your LDS, then I highly recommend this movie for your collection of movies about the church.  If your not LDS and your purpose is to degrade the church no matter what, then this movie isn't for you because even if it was historically accurate, you would still find fault with it and continue your pursecution as those during the time period.",1329782400,2,7032,4.658556366585564

It very much shows a lack of many things in a person when they do such things. If anyone would like I have a blog online called Who are the Latter-day Saints? [...] . If anyone is interested. It has explainations about who we are and what we are about. Still working on it and adding things as they come to me so please I ask for patience while I am adding more to this wonderful site. I have links there that better explain (more indepth than my blog does) about us if anyone is also interested and wants to know more. There is a lot more information than people realize about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and it's people. It's always best to get to know the truth from the sources themselves instead of from other people and what they say. I am still new with the whole blog thing so please e-mail me and let me know if you want to comment on my blog. My blog is open for discussions but I will not have untrue statements posted and debates at all there. I will delete if anyone trys anything. My blog is a place of information finding and helpful resources to go too. Not an attack arena.

If there are any members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that may have some really good thoughts on what to add onto the blog that would be more helpful please let me know?? I am open to suggestions and I check my e-mail daily. So please don't hesitate to e-mail me. Thank you! Peace be with you :)",1239062400,4,1621,4.146031746031746
1865899,4,B00008WJDY,"Overall, I thought that this was a well done movie. I thought the story concept of religious persecution and trying to learn to listen to God and follow Him were beautifully woven into this historical event. However, it was a fractured history on many occasions. There is a trial at the beginning (beautiful story telling) that never occurred because Joseph Smith never had a trial in Carthage and Brigham Young was on a mission in Boston. The flight from Nauvoo occurred two years after Joseph's death, not in a few days. The Mormons left Nauvoo in groups, not all at once with gunmen chasing them. Also, while it is true that Brigham Young doubted his callings to be a prophet, it was a vision he had at winter quarters in Nebraska that changed his doubting, not that he was still doubting at the Salt Lake Valley. I felt, overall, that the movie was good and most Latter-day Saints will actually appreciate this motion picture.",1234915200,3,930,4.676829268292683
1865900,1,B00008WJDY,"I bought this DVD because I remember seeing the movie on TV when I was a kid back in the '60s. I wanted to see if it was what I remembered. And yes, it was...a great piece of propaganda for the Mormon (LDS) church.

I was a member of that cult in the 1970s. So I know what I'm talking about.

I have an Australian friend whose mother-in-law points to the seagulls ""saving"" the crops as a miracle, since Utah is nowhere near the coast. Well, I live in Idaho. We're nowhere near the coast, either. But seagulls are here scavanging newly turned fields every year. It's no miracle. These birds adapted to an inland environment after the ""Salt Lake Sea"" receded.

Buy this if you want. But remember that it is just propaganda.",1207872000,6,721,4.365671641791045
1865901,3,B00008WJDY,"Okay, Im an atheist.  A fire breathing Objectivist.  And I loved this movie.  Its so well done that a tiny bit of me converts, I swear to god, at least for the duration of the flick.  Explains a lot about what I like about Mormons!

Its also a great adventurous tale of pioneering in the olden days when men were men....  The special effects are quite good.  Tyrone Power, great as always, and the the woman who plays Zina is hard to forget and very convincing.  But maybe I just go in for this sort of somewhat cheesy American individualist against the elements, Oregon Trail, thing.

Terrific for late night drinking and rainy afternoons and to inspire that long lost American Pioneer in you.  I'm serious!

Enjoy.",1178236800,2,716,4.559055118110236

A+++++",1168473600,,147,4.0344827586206895
1865903,4,B00008WJDY,"Considering that this movie was made in 1939 and 1940 it is an amazing achievement. The special effects are quite impressive for the time: The birds-eye view of the wagons leaving Nauvoo with the temple in center screen, Crossing the Missouri frozen river, Nauvoo homes and temple burning in the background across the river, all of the wagons and oxen crossing plains, rivers, climbing mountains, etc. But especially the near-final scene of the locusts and the seagulls (which were mostly all real).

Dean Jagger does a remarkable job as Brigham Young. He resembles him closely and even has a similar voice, according to a crew-member who was hired for coaching because he knew Brigham personally, and was around 16 when Brigham died in 1877 (50 years before filming this picture). Interesting trivia note: Dean Jagger was not LDS when he made this film but later married a Mormon woman and subsequently joined the church.

Vincent Price respected Joseph Smith greatly and had great reverence and admiration for him while playing the role of the prophet. His screentime is minimal but he does a fine job (in spite of being 10 years older than the man he was portraying).

The LDS first presidency approved the script, even though it veered from the truth on many points. They did this because they agreed that it helped make the picture more dramatic and exciting. Personally, I would prefer historical accuracy over romance or excitement, but that's how it was back then. Successful movies had a sort of recipe, and they wanted this one to follow that recipe as close as it could.

But all-in-all it paints an accurate picture of America in the 1840's and 50's and the trek of the early Mormon pioneers.

I recommend it, but if you can, watch the excellent commentary afterwards. It clears up fact from fiction and is very enlightening.

7987712,4,B00008WJDY,"The 1940 movie Brigham Young is a good portrayal of the Mormons and their journey to Utah in 1847.  The film portrays the murder of Joseph Smith (the founder of the Mormon Church), the exodus from the settlement of Nauvoo in Illinois, the journey on the Oregon/Mormon Trail, the arrival at Salt Lake, the war on the crickets, and the development of Salt Lake City.  The scene showing the war on the crickets is especially well done.  Though the movie contains some historical inaccuracies I did find it to be a good depiction of Brigham Young and his leadership.  In sum, Brigham Young is an entertaining film about a significant episode in the history of the American West.",1459296000,,674,4.686440677966102
