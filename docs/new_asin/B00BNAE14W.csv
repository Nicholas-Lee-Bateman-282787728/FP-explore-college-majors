5657912,1,B00BNAE14W,"What I thought would be a pretty cool movie at least judging from the cover turned out to be the worst cgi lizard creature or any creature I""ve ever seen setting cgi effects back about 15 years. I was hoping to see a pretty good Sc-Fy film but that went down the toilet as soon as the creature crawled out of the hole it was sealed up in after being blown open with explosives which should have been able to have dug itself out a long time ago with those claws. The only reason I bought this is seeing the other 3 reviewers who saw it and seemed to like it for some reason but they must easily be entertained and from what I read about films like this is that most of them are pretty sorry. Also, if they can't show whats on the cover of the box, then they shouldn't release films like this and I should get my money back.",1375142400,14,822,4.049079754601227
5657913,5,B00BNAE14W,I really enjoyed watching this newer horror movie.  I highly recommend it to any other horror/sci-fi movie lover.  Movie was well packaged and arrived fast.,1374883200,,156,5.2

5657915,4,B00BNAE14W,"This film takes place in Alaska; about miners working on a site and that excavate too deep and a prehistoric beast emerges causing a lot of casualties. Also about the truck drivers who haul supplies and explosives to the mining site. It has drama, a little humor and romance and lots of action.",1497052800,,294,4.566037735849057
5657916,1,B00BNAE14W,"I contemplated purchasing this. I'm glad I refrained from doing so long enough to catch it for free on the Sci-fi network.  After watching this, I came away with this feeling,  once you've seen one of these terrible low budget sci fi creature movies, you've seen them all. This thing was terrible.  The storyline, the direction, the acting, the special effects,  and overall quality of production were bad, bad bad! I wouldn't pay a penny on this....if I were you.",1492819200,,464,4.7625
5657917,3,B00BNAE14W,"For a low-budget B-movie, this actually wasn't that bad. It's got the cheap CGI you'd expect, and the characters and story are total cliche, but where many such films often leave me groaning at how stupid they are, this was honestly okay. Not good, not awful . . . just okay. I wouldn't have minded a little more ""ice road"" than I got, and the monster's defeat seemed a bit underwhelming (even by B-movie standards), but it's paced and shot a bit more competently than some of the other B flicks I've seen, and hell, even the acting isn't half-baked. They won't win any Oscars, but it's leagues better than what you often get from these movies. Overall, if you're a bad movie fan, you'll probably have a little fun with this one.",1490227200,,729,4.488721804511278

5657925,4,B00BNAE14W,"I love this movie.  I first saw it on the SyFy Channel, which, of course, had lots of commercials, especially during the last half hour. I figured I would enjoy it even better without commercials, so seeing it on DVD, was well-worth it.  The story starts out pretty fast with something crawling out of a hole in an Alaska construction site, and took off from there with lots of monster scenes.  The foreman was a total jerk, and I wasn't unhappy to see him meet his demise in a fitting way, unfortunately, it was after all of his crew had been killed.  The two lead men, Zachary Ty Bryan and Dylan Neal, were very believable as best buddies who would die for one another, I was routing for them both all the way.  This was a fast paced movie, with a lot of action, and no time to take a breath throughout most of the movie.  Some of the plot was of course a bit silly, how was the creature getting about underneath the road without the road, and the trucks, caving in? But, all in all, if you like good old-fashioned monster movies, this one is pretty good.",1475366400,,1057,4.28643216080402

5657929,5,B00BNAE14W,"Great B Movie. If you like the B movies that SyFy shows on television, you will love this movie. It has the monster, the gore, the death toll, and most of all the happy ending. I have to admit, I love these movies, I could watch them 24/7. This is one of the best of the lot. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is willing to overlook some of the things that make it a B movie and not an A movie.

5657939,1,B00BNAE14W,"I don't like to give 1 star reviews but this one deserves it. There is a lot wrong with this movie even taking into account that is a low budget movie and not meant to be taken too seriously. Just because it's low budget and the creature doesn't look that great it doesn't mean that the story has to be terrible.

There are so many problems with the story that without knowing anything about the production crew, I'd have to guess there were a few rewrites of the script. A whole lot in this movie doesn't make sense.

For starters, the acting is below average. It's not the worst I've seen but it's well below average even for a low budget movie. Throughout the movie the characters behave in a very unrealistic way. Unrealistic, even for the typical behavior of imbeciles in a horror movie. The behavior is uneven, especially Neil who at times seems brave and at other times seems like a meek baby. Jack is an idiot. He loses the trucks over sheer stupidity.

Despite appearing as a somewhat slow lumbering creature, it manages to follow our 'heroes' under the ice road despite the trucks travelling at full speed. It must have retractable fins that can't be scene along with GPS on humans. How the creature manages to follow it's prey all over Alaska is beyond me. The creature has the 'Predator' heat vision thing going for it. This trick has long since been played out by sci-fi movies.

After losing their trucks like a couple of idiots, they then, get this....walk a mile but somehow the creature can't follow them when walking but has super speed when it's prey are in their trucks. They walk on over to Lowman's house where the story gets exceedingly dumber.  Lowman says they are safe in his house because he built it. Even though it shakes just from the roar of the creature. They then start casually closing curtains and boarding up the place with the creature who ripped apart the whole mining camp walking around outside. Instead of hiding they decide to fight it out and/or make a run for it due to the fact that there is no possible way to communicate with the outside world and they are 100 miles from anywhere. A few minutes later they have another idiotic battle with the creature in which our heroes would have blown themselves up had this been real life and then guess what?....a helicopter comes to rescue them a few seconds after that. So much for nobody being able to rescue them.

The dialogue can best be described as 'corny' and it is awful most of the movie. There are too many dumb lines to count.

The effects are below average at best. The creature does not look good at all. This movie came out in 2011 and the effects should be better than this. The creature looks nothing like the creature on the cover of the DVD box. It looks like a giant gila monster with exaggerated T-Rex teeth. It looks as if they added snow in some scenes but then screw it up by having no snow in the closeups.

Recommended for nobody......ok maybe if you are a trucker on an ice road and just have to have a horror movie based on your life.",1459728000,3,3050,4.453405017921147
5657940,1,B00BNAE14W,"Have to be honest... the movie is complete garbage. The acting was a joke. The girl that played as the hitchhiker, her favorite word, ""Jack!"" She always has her mouth open through the movie... Where does the movie take place. Alaska. You'd think they would be cold. No, there's no show of coldness. Really I can't put it into words how badly this movie was made.",1456358400,,362,4.5

5657951,2,B00BNAE14W,"Be forewarned:  The creature on the cover is not the creature you get.  The actual creature in the movie is the worst CGI I've ever seen - or at least since CGI first started when?  In the early 1990s?  And it looks more like a large lizard who's incapable of attacking a cat, much less tearing a big rig to pieces.  Even my easy-to-please husband looked at me and said, ""This movie is TERRIBLE!""

5657959,2,B00BNAE14W,"I found this SyFy movie to be disappointing. I did find the romantic connection between the one trucker and the female scientist appealing, but on the whole, it was a typical TV flick which I wouldn't watch again. I know in horror, characters must be killed off, but in this one, too many characters met their demise. All in all, I found it low budget and slow with gratuitous carnage for shock value which I didn't find shocking or frightening ... just needless. I would say, watch this movie on television for free, but I wouldn't recommend spending money on it.",1437868800,,564,4.594059405940594

The story isn't to bad and if there is nothing on television or left at the video shop than this will have to do. The rating I gave this is an B grade and that was pushing it. I know we all make mistakes and I don't mind admitting it occasionally but down the track I will watch it again for punishment.

5658004,2,B00BNAE14W,"I'm not a fan of a lot of CGI generated creatures. Yet, there are films with very good CGI generated monsters. This film isn't one of them. Willis H. O'Brien and the great Ray Harryhausen would be appalled at the juvenile euphoria represented by all the lucky stars that this ridiculously inept, ""made-for-cable"" film has received. Even their old stop-motion animation is far superior, and often more biologically accurate than this. Any real creature with the biomorphic movements of this poor CGI creation would have died after it had taken its very first breaths of life! Only in a child's imagination could such a creature survive millennia underground, not to mention feed itself so ferociously, as this robotic ""ice slug"" seems to be able to do. This creature moves so slowly that the actors, in an attempt to appear to be ""running"" from something akin to a Velociraptor, literally have to be caught and eaten ""off camera."" We just see human ""remains"" flying around (thrown about by the film crew) while this pathetic CGI mutation manages to lumber along at a turtle's pace chasing down even a semi-trailer truck! I am not suggesting by any means that anyone should not watch it - especially if one likes comedy - but just don't expect much.",1410652800,2,1247,4.831775700934579

Like stabbing a woman with his tail, sorry wrong animal, just something they do in these films I guess.  Two top
drivers are making one last drive to a mining set with two trucks loaded with explosives, only to find everyone dead.  Killed by a giant lizard that they had unearthed.  Then it becomes a race to get away from the monster.  (Myself, with two trucks full of explosives, I would have used them on the monster, but then the movie would have been too short and there is a reason I am not a director).

5658011,1,B00BNAE14W,"This movie should be put on ICE!!!
Terrible movie, even by SciFi Channel standards. Terrible characters, predictable, and exceptionally bad CGI effects. The title ""Terror"".(hardly), looks like a giant cross between a komodo dragon and a gila monster, and is so flat and cartoonish they should have been able to kill it with a cartoon anvil!
Characters are mostly redneck truck drivers, hardly engaging or likeable, and one smart but dull female scientist character thrown in as a love interest. Most of the movie is about the ""monster' chasing after 2 trucks with all the characters..nothing new, original or fun.
Makes SHARKNADO look like it should be on Masterpiece Theatre. Glad I didn't pay much for this..not even a good ""B"" movie..BLEHHHHHHHHHHHH!!",1405123200,,754,5.188524590163935

The monster has graphics pre-1960 and it is one of the slowest movies I've ever seen.  90% of the film is hyping these two trucker guys that are simply terrible actors.  5% is fluff...and the remaining 5% is silly monster action.  Rather than showing the monster eat people, the crew simply throws organs and limbs on the ground like a butcher in a meat market.  If you're a horror or sci-fi fan...avoid at all cost.

Big cats do this, Alligators do this along with several other species of predator as part of their hunting style so I wasn't surprise to see it in this movie.

5658039,4,B00BNAE14W,"In a remote region of Alaska, men are willing to blast for diamonds where no men have dared blast before.  For their hubris, they get some uninvited company in the form of a fabulously crappy piece of CGI monster lizard thingy with a taste for people.  Naturally, their fearless leader is a cowardly chicken unwilling to help any of his workers save their lives.  ""You're already dead.""  (And half the man you used to be.)  There's nothing to be done but feed this thing.  Enter two truckers and the obligatory love interest.  They're hauling explosives.  It's uncharacteristically warm for that time of year.  Road conditions are terrible but they couldn't very well name this movie Slush Road Terror.  They make a run for it.  The stakes are high (something to do with a crappy trophy, I think).  Dylan Neal was the only actor I recognized and no, the layered look didn't do him any favors!  (You already know the camera puts on ten pounds, why would you then wear 75 shirts and a vest.)  Just saying.

Nothing about this movie is new or unusual; it's pretty much what you'd expect from a monster movie.  The creature looks cartoony at all times.  There are no surprises.  It plays it safe by sticking with clich&eacute;s.  I found its familiarity very comforting; it's a no-brainer.

8571555,1,B00BNAE14W,"This epic opens at the site of a diamond mine is Alaska. Forget, if you will, that there have been only two viable diamond mines in the U.S. (Arkansas and Colorado), and they closed. Lets just say that these men either made one heck of a discovery or just aren't very bright. They mine by blowing holes in the surface of the ground. This is either a novel concept in the field of diamond mining or they just aren't very bright. Hmmm. Theres a pattern developing.

On this particular day, they chose poorly when planting an explosive. Thats because a giant lizard crawls out of the hole and commences to dismember the crew. Either that or a tomato paste factory explodes. Its hard to tell from the high school video project special effects, which surpass the script and acting.

The token Eskimo in the crew explains that this creature is an old Inuit legend. Thats amazing since no old Inuit ever saw a lizard. Lizards prefer warmer climes, even with the higher rents.

While the lizard is laying waste to the mining camp, south of there, two truckers are offered a bonus to haul explosives up to the mining operation. Poorly secured loads, as it turns out. And, wouldnt you know it, just as they're about to depart, a hottie scientist show up and needs a ride to the mine. Forget that she has no luggage, no equipment and no plans for how she was going to get up there, its not as though anything in this rings true.

They arrive and find parts of bodies strewn about. Lesser men wouldve burned ice getting out of there but they hang out and encounter a couple survivors. And, the lizard. We learn that the reptile has poor vision and isn't especially fast. Except, it later demonstrates good visual acuity and enough speed to keep up with the trucks. After doing a fairly decent impression of destruction derby driving, they head south, puzzled about where the lizard had gone. Even though the lead trucker is checking the trailing one in his mirrors, he somehow misses a lizard the size of a Greyhound bus perched atop the trailer.

When the ersatz monster makes himself known, they outwit him and take off. Down the road, the lizard breaks through the 2 ice in front of them, which begs the question, how is the thin ice supporting the loaded trucks? They play chicken with it and it submerges.

But, theyve managed to dislodge the mine explosives in one truck, which go off with all the force of a party popper. Theres a Bic lighter-sized flame coming out the tailgate, so they decide to consolidate in the undamaged truck by leaping from one to the other while rumbling down the road. Yeah, right.

They make it to a rural truck stop run by an elderly couple and make a stand. The lizard perches atop the shack so they wire up the roof to the generator and give it stunning shock.  Forget that the current would barely faze a child jamming a pair of scissors into an outlet. In the process, they fry the generator and bemoan that theyve lost all electricity. There must be some kind of biblical miracle afoot, because the lamps in the house are still on.

Our hero then unleashes a shotgun on the giant lizard. Yeah, buckshot should do it. Unlikely, even though the weapon appears to hold over a dozen shells.

He then delivers the coup d grace to the scaly villain by aiming a gas pump nozzle at it and lighting the stream. Child, please.

If watch it you must, first drive a motorcycle into a concrete wall without wearing a helmet. That will help you appreciate it.",1513382400,,3474,4.515923566878981
