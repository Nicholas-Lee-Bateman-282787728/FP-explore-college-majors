1248147,5,B000021Y6L,"I am being simple in my description but it is the action and interaction of the character that make the movie, not really the story line.

John 'Smithy' Smith (Ronald Colman) not his real name wakes up in an asylum with no memory of who is. One day the door is left open and he wonders out or escapes. A dancer Paula Ridgeway (Greer Garson) spots him and eventually takes him in like a lost puppy. They eventually set-up house in a cottage in the country and have a son. He goes to a new job in Liverpool. Then it happens; he is hit by a truck and now has no memory of the three lost years as the happy and caring Smithy. He realizes he is Charles Rainier the heir of an industry and a good size house. He also has a niece Kitty Chilcet (Susan Peters) that really is not related, who is growing up fast with matrimony on her mind.

Will he marry Kitty?
Will he (or we) ever see Paula again?
Is Smithy dead?

The same actors are found in other Hilton stories; such as Ronald Colman in ""Lost Horizon"" (1937), and Greer Garson in ""Mrs. Miniver"" (1942). Greer was up for the Best Actress Oscar for this movie. However she got it for ""Mrs. Miniver"" and the rules say that you can only have one award per year.

Susan Peters was on the way up in the movies when she had an accident that left her paralyzed from the waist down. She died 10 years later at the age of 31.",1504483200,,1362,4.109022556390977

1248153,5,B000021Y6L,"Random Harvest is one of the great romantic films of classic cinema. It's the kind of film that the phrase, ""They don't make them like that anymore"" perfectly describes. It's one of those films where everything works. It was an enormous hit, the third biggest-grossing film of 1943 and made back four times its high production cost. It got the full MGM treatment, given their best production team. It was directed by Mervyn Leroy. a director whose talent spanned many genres, and who made Anthony Adverse, Little Caesar, The Wizard of Oz (uncredited), 30 Seconds Over Tokyo, Quo Vadis, Mister Roberts and Gypsy. Here his direction is spot on, never letting the sentimental material get too maudlin or melodramatic.

The film is superbly acted by the two leads whose intelligence, restraint and chemistry are what make the film work. Although they were two of the biggest stars of the '1940's neither one is as well remembered today as they deserve. Ronald Colman had been a big star in the silents and made the transition to talking films without a problem. In fact he was even bigger after the sileent era, his mellifluous voice, which conveyed intelligence, decency and sincerity, becoming his strongest asset. Interestingly, his role was written in James Hilton's novel as a twenty year old as it opens, but because it's Colman, we accept him in the role without question. At a later point in the film his age makes for a slightly awkward situation (missing in the novel), but again because it's Colman, we let it go. Greer Garson was a new face, having just broken through in the biggest film of the year, Mrs. Miniver. The two films together made her a major star in a very short time. Like Colman she exhuded a warmth, kindness and decency that made the two seem perfectly matched. You want these two to get together.

They are supported by an excellent cast of actors including Reginald Owen as Biffer, a friendly bartender and former boxer; Susan Peters as Colman's young niece Kitty; and Philip Dorn as Dr. Jonathan Bennett, a psychiatrist who plays an important role. Familiar faces Henry Travers, Melville Cooper, Rhys Williams and Una O'Connor also appear in smaller roles. But it's all Colman and Garson's show and it's their presence that holds the whole thing together.

Author James Hilton was on a roll at this point, having written Goodbye Mr. Chips, Lost Horizon, foreign Correspondent and the screenplay for Mrs. Miniver. The plot of Random Harvest will offer some challenges, especially for some contemporary viewers. The story is an out and out romance, and as such you have to accept it on its own terms and by doing so, be rewarded by its twists and turns and final outcome. The 1940's were fascinated by psychology and psychoanalysis and movies found much material there. Amnesia (a malady that seems to have occurred more in films than in real life) plays an important role in this film and the way it is used as a plot device strains credibility. My advice is to simply accept it or the movie won't have its full effect. There are a few other moments that don't quite add up, but the film is too good to bother noticing.

An extra word has to be added about Herbert Stothart's score, one of the film's other outstanding supporting players. This is one of those classic Hollywood films where music is playing almost entirely throughout the picture. It's very important in sustaining the mood but is just barely noticeable most of the time, unlike films where the score is practically demanding that you feel a certain way. This restraint makes it far more effective than a loud, melodramatic score ever could. Speaking of music, Greer Garson sings an old Harry Lauder tune and dances on stage in a show number and does it all quite credibly.

If you like romantic films, this one will really tear you up and put you through the wringer before it's all over but it's worth it. Famed director Sidney Pollack presented this film on TCM's ""Essentials"". He had wanted to remake this film but after watching it realized it simply could not be remade. It's that good.",1497830400,,4086,4.765536723163842

1248166,5,B000021Y6L,"Unlike the novel upon which it is based, the movie proceeds in a linear fashion, and the audience is aware through the whole story of the nature of the central character's memory loss. We know why he is so sad and feels something missing from his life. The book by Hilton by contrast begins in the middle of the story and the reader (unless they have viewed the movie) does not know what it is that or who is missing.",1495497600,,417,4.225

1248171,2,B000021Y6L,Don't waste your time or your money. This is a very formulaic film with perhaps one of the sappiest scores I've ever heard. Ronald Coleman was way too old to play the love interest of Greer Garson (and old enough to have been a young grandpa to Susan Peters) and there's just not very much chemistry between them. The story is not at all believable. There are hundreds of better classic movies to spend a date night with.,1491264000,,421,4.410256410256411

Actually, the acting was pretty solid across the board.  There is a scene between Charles and Kitty in the church when they are picking out wedding music.  The organist plays a song that strikes Charles' memory and he looks out the window, dazed and trying to remember.  Kitty walks over and looks at him, then he turns to look at her.  Neither one of them said a word, but their expressions said everything--simply remarkable.  It seems like you don't see this kind of acting anymore.... Of course it has a happy ending, but there are a lot of emotions in this film.

Picture and sound quality are very good and subtitles are available if needed.  If you like Ms. Garson, Mr. Colman, or sappy love stories in general, this one comes highly recommended!",1468022400,,920,4.735849056603773

TITLE: Random Harvest (1942)  PG-13  2:06:29
  Ronald Colman, Greer Garson, Susan Peters, Reginald Owen
  Mervyn LeRoy (Director)

  This movie is an excellent example of why MGM was the PREMIERE movie studio in the world from the mid 1930s to the mid 1950s. This movie has comedy, wit, drama, romance, style, tragedy and triumph. It has a superb cast featuring Ronald Colman, Greer Garson, Susan Peters, Reginald Owen, Una O'Connor and Henry Travers. It also features very-good direction and excellent acting. And, finally, it has high production values (i.e.very good lighting, very good wardrobe, good- to very-good sets, good editing, and  best of all  it features a very well-written and highly-moving story). In short, if you're a fan of ""old"" movies and/or an incurable romantic, do yourself a BIG favor and buy (and watch) this movie. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

  See the other reviews for more detail and/or other opinions regarding the plot of the movie.

VIDEO: 1.33:1  B&W  480p  MPEG-2 (5.9 Mbps)

  Within the confines of the DVD format, this film exhibits excellent picture quality  in part, I'm sure, because of its much higher than average bit-rate (for a B&W, 4:3 movie on DVD). Apparently Warner Bros. has also done some re-mastering work on this classic film, because there are very few artifacts such as black specks, white dots, hair-lines or dropped frames. In addition, sharpness and detail (for a DVD) are VERY good  with the textures of most clothing and furnishings being readily apparent. Also, contrast and gray scale (again, for a DVD) are VERY good overall, and in many scenes, even excellent. This is the best that this movie is going to look until it gets officially re-mastered and re-released on blu-ray.

AUDIO: Dolby Digital 1.0 (Mono)

  Warner Home Video has apparently also done some clean-up work on the film's soundtrack, because there are no loud bumps nor objectionably high levels of hiss. Also, dialog is very clear and all voices are easily understood. However, dynamic range is limited, and there is not much bottom-end nor any top-end to speak of (which makes the musical score and the Foley work all sound a little 'thin' and not quite realistic). Otherwise, considering the age of the source elements and the fact that this is a monophonic, dialog-driven movie from the early 1940s, its audio presentation has acceptable sound quality.

So many nice reviews have already been posted attesting to the quality and sheer delight of this truly great love story that I won't regurgitate them but will simply say, thank goodness for those organizations that are preserving such great old classics as Random Harvest.  There have been so many great films lost forever due to the stupidity of studios improperly storing them and/or focusing all their attention and money on making today's trash movies or movies brimming with special effects.  As such, studios are slowly letting the old great films slide into oblivion.  Thank goodness also for entities such as TCM who make it their mission to show classic movies so upcoming generations have the opportunity to formulate an appreciation for really great movies made during the eras when actors and actresses were just that.  They knew how to act and delivered performances sans baring their T&A or using the ""F"" word every other word.  The acting chemistry between Colman and Garson resulted in a truly believable, beautiful and touching love story, one that can never be replicated by any of today's so called ""stars"".

1248234,5,B000021Y6L,"It's a rare and precious thing when a movie surprises. Oh, it's not that I'm such a discerning film-goer as much as it's a knock on cinema's dearth of original storytelling. RANDOM HARVEST happens to carry one of the all-time surprise twists for me, and it's only one reason out of many to cherish it. It stars Ronald Colman and Greer Garson, two old-timey favorites of mine, and, in 1942, these two worked wonderful magic together, he as ""John Smith,"" she as ""Paula Ridgeway."" Smith is a World War I veteran who is so deeply traumatized he'd incurred amnesia. He finds solace in the company of a kind-hearted showgirl named Paula, and off Paula and ""Smithy"" - as she affectionately dubs him - go on their fresh start. But then an accident reestablishes Smithy's old memories, buries his more recent ones. So, there's Smithy restored to his former life, a powerful industrialist now, and no room now in his fragmented mind for Paula, she who gave everything up for him. Ah, but then...

Every so often, even a manly man like me must lay off the stonemasonry and the krav maga and the breaking in of wild mustangs. Every so often, I strive to soak in some culture. And ain't nothing like these prestigious MGM films to make you feel all high-falutin'. I love this movie so much. I don't know that I can trumpet to the world that RANDOM HARVEST is Colman's best flick because, y'know, LOST HORIZON, THE PRISONER OF ZENDA, IF I WERE KING, RAFFLES... I love all these movies. RANDOM HARVEST speaks to the inner romantic in even the most flinty of viewers because when you see these characters endure such lengths to achieve their measure of grace, it makes you pause and marvel. There is a panoramic sweep to the story and perfect pacing and a lushness to the romance. There is bone-deep heartbreak and unfathomable sacrifice, and you must, must have a heart of uncrackable stone to not get swept along in its detritus of shattered emotions. Colman and Greer are simply magnificent. But also credit Susan Peters' memorable performance, a promising MGM starlet who, in a perfect world, would've better capitalized on the critical acclaim garnered for her role here, except a hunting accident in 1945 left her paralyzed from the waist down which effectively put paid to her acting career. Peters plays a distant relative of Smithy's, and she is in turns sassy and wistful and moving and wise beyond her years. It's quite a gamut of emotions but all of them effortlessly within Peters' range.

I so much want to tell you what the plot twist is. But you'll hate me for spoilering it. So I won't. RANDOM HARVEST remains one of the screen's timeless love stories and a boss of a movie. To this day, there's a radiant glow about it and a ready knack for generating revenue for the Kleenex empire. For the trivia-head, author James Hilton was so taken with the film - never mind that changes were made from his book to the film adaptation - that he recorded the opening narration himself. So, there, I've done my bit for you swoony types. For me, it's back to snake-wrangling or log-sawing or whatever bunch of bs I laid claim to before.",1449360000,,3125,4.6389891696750905

He then regains his memory, but forgets about his wife. If I go on in this manner you will not buy this. However incredible the story line may be Colman and Garson overcome it all. Bring the Kleenex.

Hollywood does its usual thing in this one, deleting huge swaths of what is a truly unforgettable story, changing settings, casting inappropriate actors, Americanizing it, and turning deep emotion into banality. It's an especial shame with this story. Read the BOOK instead, which is infinitely better than this insipid version. If I could give this movie no stars I would, but since it's necessary to rate it, the best I can give it is 1 star, and that's a stretch",1403049600,,583,5.083333333333333

She loves even when all hope is gone.  She never gives up when she finally finds love but a love that she must wait for.  This movie is touching and heart warming.

1248567,5,B000021Y6L,"It's hard to go wrong with leads like Ronald Colman and Greer Garson and with lesser stars it could have played as far fetched.  But the gravity of the two actors make this a first rate love story.  A monster hit in its time full of touching sentimentality from a classy era now long gone. Garson is radiant and at her 1940's war era peak. This is also her favorite film although she won the Oscar the same year for Mrs. Miniver.  This film is also in the AFI top 100 love stories of all time. If you like classic films then they don't get much better than this.
  As a footnote: I get tired of people reviewing classic films through a contemporary lens. None of the tripe we all go see in droves these days could  hold up to how we view film 70 years later.

One can see why it particularly was fair game for one of Carol Burnett's hilarious movie spoofs, as mentioned by another reviewer.  Industry-wide, they seemed to have an ongoing shortage of good material and/or how to handle what they came across, and resorted to some very absurd premises.  However, usually the stronger leads can overcome that, which is what happened here.  This one also has the older actors playing younger people element, without much adjustment being given to that factor, which was also routinely done.  Despite all that, the film has the usual high MGM production values and two of their best stars.

1248675,5,B000021Y6L,"One of James Hilton's 3 masterpieces. Incredible books all, & incredible films. Random Harvest is a rich romance; the story has an underused, perhaps even original plot.
I don't want to spoil it but here goes: WWI vet with amnesia, walks away from mental hospital during chaos of war's ending. Ronald Colman (vet), is taken under the wing of a showgirl (Greer Garson ) & her acting troupe.
In a rare scene for Garson, she sings, dances & shows off her very pretty legs.
Colman sickens with the worlewide flu epedimic that occurred after that war &  Garson leaves  her job to nurse him; they fall in love, marry &  even though he still can't remember, have a baby.
He takes a  trip to the city when he finally gets an offer on a book he wrote. While there, he's hit by car & wakes up another person -his former, forgotten self.
That's all you get for now, but there's so much more to come.
This is a wonderful Ronald Colman film & Greer Garson is better in my opinion, than in her Mrs. MIniver role.
Even the guys should like this one - and that speaking voice of Colman's? Come on, no ones has had a better voice since.  In the old days, they'd call it a 2 hanky film.

1248677,1,B000021Y6L,"During World War II, Americans resorted to escapist fare - in books, film, stage, etc. - in order to cope with (or ignore) the horrors of global atrocities. The Depression and WWII educated Americans that there existed conditions and policies that ignored the United States' status as a utopian environment - and it was finally acknowledged that the U.S. was just another component/entity of the human and worldwide experience - good and bad. In this context, such fare as ""Random Harvest"" was conceived: to divert the populace from the egregious reality of warfare and annihilation and to provide solace in contrivance and fantasy.

Amnesia as a medical condition is a rarity in reality. There are actually very few documented incidences of this ailment. But in this film, the protagonist portrayed by Ronald Colman experiences this affliction twice in the course of the movie's two-hour running time. In the beginning of the film, his amnesia, due to having been shell-shocked in WWI combat, is believable. He has forgotten about his past and shall shortly progress to a rewardingly loving relationship with Greer Garson's character - who's compassionate and nurturing. But then he suffers from amnesia again.

If once is effective, do the filmmakers think that a second dose of amnesia would result in a movie that will be twice as successful? (Or the novelist, James Hilton? - not having read his book, I cannot vouch for the film's adherence/faithfulness in its portrayal of this double bout of amnesia). This film is a confection with an excess/surfeit of sugar. And it has absolutely no bearing on reality, but instead caters to audiences far too willing to bury the daily vissicitudes of life deep within one's subconscious. It is understandable that a daily dose of reality can result in pessimism, demoralization, and even one's questioning the existence of God. But this filmic contrivance is an atrocity - certainly not on par with the occurances at the time, e.g., the Nazi's invasion of Europe, the Holocaust, the rape of Nanjing, ad infinitum. And certainly this film is an insult to all thinking people.

Should you be saddled with this DVD, try to focus on Susan Peters' truly nuanced and accomplished performance. Her career ended far too prematurely and far too tragically, and her acting in this insignificant and inane film provides the only compensation.",1346803200,,2376,5.087179487179487
1248678,5,B000021Y6L,"Have to admit it.  I simply love the movies like Random Harvest that were made in the late thirties and early forties.  Those set in England are particular favorites.  All those magnificent estates that no one can afford to heat nowadays.  The ubiquitous servants, usually played by marvelous character actors, that hover about.  Those breatfast scenes with tables weighed down by silver serving dishes.  Yummy.  (That silver had to be sterling.  Or was it Georgian plate?)  Was the image of that England real or the imaginings of the American cousins?  Whether real or a fantasy, that England, like the films that portrayed it, no longer exists.  Random Harvest presented a broader view of this real or imagined England than did other film like it.  The milieus of estate, pub, country cottage, and others are all there.  Greer Garson dresses up in a mini kilt and sings and dances like Sir Harry Lauder.  She was good... and so were her legs.

Well, it's a wonderful movie  and my significant contribution to the reviews is another 5 star vote.  One of the 1's is complaining
about Warner Bros., not appropriate for this forum.  Another who fell asleep obviously doesn't know the story, because Colman is
not about to marry Garson's daughter.

So that I'm not merely doing what I'm complaining of, here's a brief synopsis:  A WWI vet has amnesia.  He wanders away from the
hospital, falls in love and gets married.  Subsequently an accident restores his memory, but he loses the alternate life memory.
So, he goes home and forgets his wife.  The wife hunts him down and becomes his assistant but does nothing to inform him of
their past.  So the story plays out until he remembers her on his own.  These movies are about entertainment, who cares how improbable
these amnesia events might actually be.  It makes for a great romance.

I will add one of my own pet peeves.  Somebody needs to come out with a Greer Garson collection.  What an increbible body of work:
Random Harvest, Mrs. Parkington, Goodbye Mr. Chips, Blossoms in the Dust, Mrs. Miniver, Madame Curie, That Forsythe Woman ...

He returns to the old family home with key in his pocket his only real clue to those years. His post war love searches for him only to find the shell of the man that doesn't recognize her and could be lost to her should she reveals a true identity.

Paula: That's a strange thing for you to say. Your capacity for loving, your joy in living, is buried in a little space of time you've forgotten.
Charles: In some vague way, I still have...
Paula: ...hope?
Charles: Yes, I suppose that's it.
Paula: Have you, Charles? Do you feel that there... really is someone? That someday you may find her? You may have... come so near her, may even have brushed her on the street... You might even have met her, Charles. Met her and not known her. It might be someone you know, Charles. It might... it might even be me.

An amnesiac soldier known only as 'John Smith' (Ronald Colman) wanders out of the county asylum on the same fateful night that peace is declared in England.  Lonely and ill, he meets by chance a charming music-hall entertainer, Paula Ridgeway (Greer Garson), who gives him a sympathetic shoulder to lean on.  Together, they move to the quiet English countryside where, as 'Smithy', he carves out a small career as a journalist and marries Paula.  But during a brief business trip, a car accident catapults 'Smithy' back into his old life as Charles Rainier, millionaire industrialist, complete with another set of romantic entanglements - chiefly Kitty (Susan Peters in an Academy Award-nominated performance).  Paula finally tracks down her husband, and, using an alias, becomes his faithful secretary, but must be careful in her attempts to jog Charles's memories of his former life.

Based on the 1941 novel by James Hilton (""Lost Horizon"", ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips""), RANDOM HARVEST is indeed a ripe showcase for the talents of it's topline stars, who between them had already played out roles in the film versions of Hilton's previous works (Colman in ""Lost Horizon"" and Garson in ""Chips"").  Combined in RANDOM HARVEST, these stars are beyond luminous.

Ronald Colman is infinitely touching as Charles/'Smithy', and plays out his internal dilemma quite beautifully.  He is especially moving in the opening scenes.  It's probably no accident that a story about the effects of war on the minds of soldiers in WW1 appeared just as the world was gearing up for WW2, and I'm sure Louis B. Mayer jumped on the movie rights with an eye towards using the film as propaganda (this was also true for ""Mrs. Miniver"").

A landmark in the annals of great screen romances, 1942's RANDOM HARVEST firmly cemented Greer Garson as the stoic, self-sacrificing wife--in the same year she also played ""iron rose"" Mrs. Miniver in the film of the same name, winning the Academy Award for her performance, but it might just as easily been awarded for her stellar turn in this film.  Paula is definitely amongst the best of Garson's film roles.  Never once does she hit a false note, or become melodramatic.  She even gets to sing, with a joyous scene set in the London music-hall.  In lots of ways this is the ultimate Greer Garson film, and that is taking into account her ""Mrs. Miniver"" triumph.

The DVD includes two vintage shorts (""Marines in the Making"" and ""Don't Talk"", audio of the Lux Radio Theater version with Colman and Garson; and a Greer Garson trailer gallery, comprising the trailers for this, ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"" and ""Mrs. Miniver"").",1314576000,,3262,4.882246376811594

Directed by Mervyn LeRoy

Director Mervyn LeRoy must be given credit for bringing it to the screen in a film that has all the ingredients to keep the viewer glued to his seat.  Author James Hilton gives us a glimpse into the lives of two people who met not once but twice with strange results.  Mervyn LeRoy, the James Hilton story and that wonderful company of players make this a perfect fiilm or our viewing pleasure.

There is a magic to this film, with several twists and turns  about lost love and rediscovering those lost moments when all seems hopeless.

Ronald Colman plays his dual characters with an ease that is mesmerizing to watch, made these two men credible as if they were separate persons and yet not at all - the amnesiac soldier, as well as the business magnate that he was prior to losing his mind in the war.

Greer Garson was one of the most accomplished actress' of the time, with her natural beauty, her tact, gentle humor and intelligent restraint are in perfect service to her character and the story, made us believe she is the woman whose love for her man is everything, that of Mr. Ronald Colman very talented and a leading man in Hollywood of the times.

Colman and Garson are the perfect grownup romantic couple: they make intelligence and maturity seem impossibly glamorous, and they embody the idea that friendship, loyalty and mutual respect must be at the center of every enduring love, which should be in every relationship.

Nominated for Oscar Best Actor in a Leading Role (Ronald Colman), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Susan Peters), Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration (Black-and-White), Best Director (Mervyn LeRoy), Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture (Herbert Stothart), Best Picture (M-G-M) and Best Writing, Screenplay

Special Footnote: -- Ronald Colman had first-hand experience of shell shock - he had fought in the British army at the Battle of Ypres in World War I, during which he was also gassed.

Ronald Colman fought with the British army in World War I at the battle of Ypres in 1914 where he received severe shrapnel wounds to the knee and ankle of one of his legs. He was decorated for bravery and was invalided out of the army several months later.

Reported to be Greer Garson's favorite of all her film career appearances.

1248723,4,B000021Y6L,"This is a wonderful story of true love and devotion! Greer Carson is as beautiful as ever and she brings a such devotion to this roll. She was so believable that when the film was over I found myself wanting more and wondering how this wonderful couple was doing. If there is a negative with this film its the fact that the writers if this film had trouble getting to the point and establishing a real story. There were time during the movie  I felt like I had gotten in on the middle of a story that had started in another film! But Greer Carson and Ronald Coleman pulled it together and made this film romantic and lovely to watch,no, experience!",1313452800,,648,4.355371900826446
1248724,5,B000021Y6L,On the surface this is an emotionally gripping love story.  But the deeper allegory of married life as one where we too often forget the beginnings of the love that started a husband and wife down the path to marriage in the first place.  We become too comfortable with one another and lose that sense of devoting ourselves entirely to the other.  The lucky few rediscover that intense flame that brought them together and they remember why it is they first fell in love and they fall in love all over again.  A classic film with a classic theme of keeping love aflame.  Ronald Colman and Greer Garson were never better than together in this film.  A must have.,1312761600,,661,4.512605042016807

1248743,5,B000021Y6L,"""Random Harvest"" is one of my mothers favorite movies.  She always talked about Ronald Coleman's silky voice.  I first saw this movie about 35 years ago and I finally purchased it this year.  I am giving this movie amongst several to my mother for Christmas.  Ronald Coleman is wonderful in this movie as well as several others such as ""A Double Life"" and ""A Tale of Two Cities"".  Greer Garson is one of my favorite actresses from that era of movie making.  She was fabulous in ""Mrs. Miniver"" which she won best actress Academy award the same year of the release of ""Random Harvest"" and I loved her in ""Madame Curie"".  You basically know how Random Harvest will end but, the movement of the movie with its little twist and turns keeps you glued to every nuance of this film.  This was a fine movie with its great cinematography.",1291593600,,828,4.510067114093959
1248744,5,B000021Y6L,"In 1942, Greer Garson was on a roll.  She was to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress in MRS. MINIVER and she was also hailed for a stunning performance as a woman who loses her husband to amnesia in RANDOM HARVEST.  It was important for Hollywood to present England in a favorable and optimistic light so Director Mervyn LeRoy used his stable of British stars to recreate a suitably stolid cast of reliable actors to people a backround that looked English but was a Hollywood sound set.  The result was a superior soap that was so good so involving that the audience was regaled from the first reel to the last.

Ronald Coleman, who was in his early fifties at the time, is a soldier who is confined to a sanitarium due to loss of memory.  He escapes in a daze where he meets Paula (Garson), who immediately risks her job as a singer/dancer to help him.  That she falls in love with him at first glance is not so far fetched given the exegencies of wartime England. She called him ""Smithy,"" since he has none of his own.  They marry and live in relative peace and a slowly growing affluence due to his talent as a writer.  When he travels to Liverpool for a job offer, he is struck by a car, and wakes up with no memory of his marriage to Paula but his memories of his prior life are intact.  At this point, one might be forgiven to point a finger of dramatic slackness at the director for using such an obvious ploy, but events force us to care about his fate and Paula's fate, who guesses that something like this was inevitable.  What follows is pure soap but Coleman's convincing screen persona of the erudite gentleman carries the middle part of the film.  Greer Garson disappears for this mid part and her place is taken by Kitty (Susan Peters) a fifteen year old step daughter of his sister who, like Paula, immediately and totally falls for him.  We see Kitty's relation slowly grow into a believable courtship, no easy feat there since the audience might have looked askance at the huge disparity in ages.  They wait several years until Kitty is twenty-one and they decide to marry.  There is a powerful scene in the church where they are preparing for the nuptuals and Kitty stares at his face and sees indecision.  Coleman says not a word, but his countenance clearly evinces his lack of true love for her and his lingering feeling for some female during his lost years.  Much of the film deals with the ramifications of Coleman's amnesia.  Later, Paula reappears as his secretary and she has to hide her feelings and true identity since he does not recognize her.  The final twenty minutes pushes the two toward a recognition on his part of who he was and what he did during those lost years.  Little clues add up incrementally, eventually nudging him toward their former residence where the final reconciliation is made.  The last scene is a study in contrasts between Coleman's face as he slowly connects the lost dots and Garson's face as she waits, hoping against hope, that he will succeed.  The enduring beauty of RANDOM HARVEST is that we wait, along with Garson, for Coleman to remember.  Only the best soaps can do this.",1291507200,,3148,4.524734982332156
1248745,5,B000021Y6L,"The first time I saw this movie, I missed everything up to the point when ""Smithy"" went to Liverpool.  Even missing all that, I loved this movie, but never knew the title.  I was so excited to finally see it from the beginning.  And it didn't disappoint!  What a powerful movie! Ronald Coleman may have been a bit long in the tooth to play this part, but he brought a wonderful vulnerability to the role.  And Greer Garson - WOW! I'd never seen her play anything even remotely bawdy, but that Scottish number and risque outfit were fabulous.  They just don't make movies or actors and actresses like that anymore!!!",1288656000,,615,4.545454545454546
1248746,5,B000021Y6L,"This is a classic ""tear-jerker"".  Delightfully performed by Colman & Garson.  Beautifully photographed in dramatic black & white.  The story begins during the last days of WWI in an industrial town in South England.  Ronald Colman is an amnesia victim who wanders off from an asylum when he serendipitously meets an engaging stage singer/entertainer(Greer Garson).

They marry and have a child, all the while he still cannot remember his past life.  On a business trip, he is struck by a car, becomes unconscious and his past memory comes back, but he now does not remember anything of his life with Garson.

As with all melodramas, his true life is as a wealthy aristocrat who excells in business all the while privately tormented by the vague memory of another life.  Also to keep the excitement, Garson has become his secretary/assistant who never reveals to Colman any hint of who or what she had been to him even as she watches him almost marry another woman and then agrees herself to marry Colman ""in name only"" and helps him to rise in prominance in the English government.

The years go by and the last scene in the movie when Colman finally recalls all the years of his life is maybe by todays standards a bit corny, but so beautifully done.

It's a great film for history buffs and romantics of any age.",1287100800,,1314,4.673913043478261
1248747,5,B000021Y6L,"This is a wonderful romantic drama, dealing with a serious by-product of war as well as the uncertainty of human relationships.

1248749,5,B000021Y6L,This one of the great love stories.  But you have to understand that the greatness of the story has little to do with Ronald Coleman's character.  Paula Ridgeway is one of the great heroines of all time.  Every man should want a woman to love him the way Paula Ridgeway loves Ronald Coleman's character.,1275436800,,303,4.574074074074074
1248760,5,B000021Y6L,"Random Harvest is a very strange film: it ought not to work at all, but it does.  The reason is that it is a kind of archetypal myth (there are Arab and Hindu stories of men suddenly losing twenty years and then recovering their original lives again in the blink of an eye) with James Hilton using memory loss (twice) here as the vehicle for the man's story.  It is linked with another archetypal myth,  the woman's story, a kind of Eurydice or Psyche story of her seeking Orpheus to redeem him (and her) as well -- his redemption is simultaneously  her redemption. She is prepared to sacrifice everything just so he will recognize her for who she really is, even though he is staring her right in the face.  The moment he sees her for who she really is, is the moment he will get his memory back, and vice versa.  This is the secret of the film's power, which overrides the complete absurdity of the plot.  The myth speaks to everyone who wants to be seen for who they are,  or who were once seen as who they are, by someone they love, but somehow that act of being seeing as who one really is by the other, that look of recognition, has become lost over the years.

This is in another sense the apotheosis of the Hollywood obsession with the ""face"" -- the film keeps recurring to Garson's face as if somehow her face is the key to his self-recognition (which of course it is, and is the reason why the last shot of the film is of her face).

All kinds of silly things and implausibilities riddle the film but none of it matters.  The flimsiness of the ""British"" Hollywood world actually adds to the mythic flavour of the film -- the fake cottage, the absurd Random Hall, the foggy streets, the stock British character actors --  it is an unreal world.  On the other hand, some of the reviews here make more implausibilities than there actually are. For example, there is no reason why Colman shouldn't be older at the beginning of the film -- he's a captain (or a major) in the army.

Perhaps the most brilliant moments in the film are in the first fifteen minutes, which has a kind of German expressionist feel about it, and a beautiful rhythm.  The absurdity of Smith's wartime terror mingling with the arrival of its exact opposite, the armistice, is brilliantly ironic, and deftly orchestrated.  A special mention should be made of the sound -- Herbert Stothard's work, again especially at the beginning, is astonishing, it carries the plot along with its layering of remembered sound (note at the end when Smith's memory begins to come back, how the tunes recur very faintly).  And Colman's acting in the early scenes is the best he ever did (the scene with the possible parents is devastating), though one does fondly recall the moment in Lost Horizon when Robert Conway loses his faith in the truth of Shangri-La.  Colman was one of the one or two best screen actors -- as a screen actor -- there has ever been, because his emotional truth reads so clearly on screen.  Similarly, Garson's early scenes are her best -- she has a kind of believable sweetness that goes away as she becomes the stiff-upper-lip sufferer.  Her best scene is the one with him in the dressing room -- she just radiates openness and believability.  She makes one believe that she's a kind of ""ready-for-anything"" person,  and this helps propel us through a whole pile of succeeding improbabilities.  The first fifteen minutes of the film are completely heartbreaking -- the lost officer full of grief in the midst of wild, mass happiness (one is reminded of the carnival scene in Les Enfants du Paradis).  It is as if the memory of the First World War ought to be unassimilateable by anyone,  and this lost soul is its symbol.

Watching the film again one notices all kinds of little symbolic touches: for instance, how the whole film is ""bookended"" by movement towards doors that will open and free one from the chains of memory loss.  Smithy clutching his parcel of clothes like a real refugee.  The melee of the soldiers in the theatre flooding the stage -- and how something about it triggers Smithy's fainting spell (ostensibly from flu). There is also a dream quality about the final scene -- by rights the fact that the tree at the gate hasn't grown at all, and the gate door has never been oiled, and that the village (as already mentioned) is so obviously an MGM fake English village should aggravate us -- but it is as if the tree and the gate and memory are all frozen in some mythic archetypal past, needing to be reawakened into life.

I suppose the hardest thing to believe in the film is that Greer Garson's character couldn't have had a stage career (she is very, very good in her song and dance number). But that is part of the subtlety of the film: there is a sense in which everyone's life is not quite working the second time around,  and so it might be that she couldn't bring that fizzy innocence to the stage a second time. Another example of great acting in the film is the way in which Colman gives us a sense that though he becomes terribly successful and seemingly happy, he too is crippled.  It is done with extreme subtlety -- the scene with Kitty where he looks blankly at her is amazingly done.  It is one of the best things about the movie that he is matched in these scenes by Susan Peters in quality.  That everything went wrong for her is such a tragedy.

A strange, great, deep, haunting film, that ought to be stupid sentimental trash, but isn't.  It just carries you along into very strange emotional realms that you shouldn't be drawn into, but are.  It is also an extraordinary testament to the screenwriters (all three of them!) that they could make a streamlined, powerful, story out of a really second-rate novel (contrary to other opinions).  It is a complete disaster. The original novel wanders around and is endless, told at second hand by a completely contrived narrator.  The novel is full of opinions about whatever the author is interested in on any subject that is of passing interest.  The arrival of World War II is contrived to arrive on the last page of the novel -- at exactly the same moment as the great revelation -- as if we needed that (ah, England has found its memory again!).  Ridiculous tripe.  The movie starts on page 197 of my copy of the novel (where the Melbury story begins).  And then movie magic strikes.....",1274140800,,6366,4.533683289588802

1248766,5,B000021Y6L,"Random Harvest is truly one of the most romantic, well written and acted movies of all time. This movie captures the essence of why we go to the movies. Ronald Colman, an amnesiac from the Great War, is found by Greer Garson, in her most engaging of all films, wandering the streets, and she cares for him. She helps him heal with love despite the best psychiatric care available to wounded soldiers, and they fall in love and marry and then she becomes pregnant. His pre-War brilliance begins to emerge, and he is hired to write for a newspaper in Liverpool; while securing the job, he is struck by a car and his memory returns...and he forgets his life with her. In one of the most clever plots ever, they are reunited, but he is still unable to remember her. It's heart wrenching, but the finale still makes me cry. I met Greer Garson in 1976 at my college where she and her husband were benefactors (College of Santa Fe in NM), and she aired this movie to the college for the students to enjoy! (I sat right in front of her crying my eyes out!) She loved it too! She was wonderfully generous to the College of Santa Fe and its students. Despite her fame and great beauty even late in life, she was so kind to everyone. She shared a story about Random Harvest; she told me that she would call Ronnie when RH was played on late night TV in the New York area to reminisce about how wonderful RH still was many years later!

1248767,5,B000021Y6L,"""My life began with you. I can't imagine a future without you."" -- Smithy

This gentle spring blossom to true love is one of the most beautifully rendered romances ever filmed. It is pure and untarnished, a reminder that love begins in the heart, eclipsing all other things, and is all in life that truly matters. Mervyn LeRoy was a fine studio director who made some memorable films, many now considered screen classics. The romanticist fingerprints of Sidney Franklin, however, give strong evidence that as producer, he and LeRoy worked closely to make this film one of the loveliest of any decade. Having directed Smilin' Through in 1932, starring Norma Shearer and Leslie Howard, he is in fact responsible for two of the most exquisite love stories spanning two decades.

James Hilton's tale of a shell-shocked WWI veteran unable to remember and the years of ghost-ridden love that follow is touchingly realized by Ronald Colman and Greer Garson. They make a story that spans years so terribly involving that this film becomes a part of the viewer carried in their hearts long after the final credits. The kind of old-fashioned love between Colman and Garson is so rare in our time it has a nostalgic quality, a reminder of how love used to be, and still is, for a lucky few. Colman is magnificent, small gestures and haunted looks capturing the efforts of an anguished man trying to somehow put together the voices and whispers of memories as they drift like snowflakes though his mind and heart, then dissolve into nothingness as he reaches out to catch them.

Greer Garson is remarkable in one of her finest performances. Her devotion and tender caring, trying to hang around just on the chance someone might one day remember her is so utterly real it tugs at the heartstrings. She is lovely and wistful, alluring and charming, and makes anyone viewing Random Harvest wish for such love and devotion, or be thankful if they are among the rare few who possess something so valuable. A lovely score from Herbert Stothart and the lush photography of Joseph Ruttenberg frame Colman and Garson against a background full of small but perfect details; a romantic refrain or snow falling outside a windowpane during a tender moment making magic in the darknesss. There are great classic films as lovely, many of which I've seen and commented on, but none which surpass it. It is a long and beautiful love letter to love and devotion.

Hilton's story, adapted to the screen by Claudine West, George Froeschel and Arthur Wimperis begins in the autumn of 1919 at an asylum with a military wing for shattered minds of the war to end all wars. Colman is the traumatized soldier who barely speaks, an amnesiac longing just to belong to someone, and knowing he doesn't belong there. In the excitement and wild frenzy created by the armistice, he simply walks out one night and escapes. It is in a tobacco shop that he first meets the kind and sweet Paula, who helps him dodge those out to take him back and falls in love with her Smithy. He also falls in love with the music-hall angel, and when her friends don't understand, wanting to send him back too, she runs away with her Smithy and they start a new life.

It is a beautiful display of faith and love, her tender devotion healing his broken and lost spirit as they find their own happiness. He begins to write, and proposes once he feels useful again. A key to the cottage where their happiness abounded is the only tangible item connecting him to that world, however, when a car accident causes him to remember who he was, and forget his Paula, and who he is now. Charles Ranier is a good man, from a fine family, but the capacity for love and joy are things from his former life he no longer possesses. He moves into business then politics, somewhat haunted by things just out of his reach, knowing there is something more, but unable to remember. He proposes a marriage of convenience to his wonderful secretary Miss Hanson, not understanding how this must hurt her, for Miss Hansen is also his Paula.

Garson is simply wonderful here, deciding to accept in the hopes that even if he doesn't remember, he will fall in love with her all over, and become her sweet Smithy once again. Young Susan Peters is also enchanting as Kitty, a young woman who adores Charles and begs off their marriage when she realizes he is haunted by a ghost of which she only reminds him. It is tender and touching, and you realize what a great film this is by the emotional depth of it. There are no wasted scenes or feelings in this film; it is all part of a beautiful mosaic to be seen with the eyes and felt by the heart. When it becomes too much for Claudia to pretend anymore, she goes on a long vacation, revisiting the old places where they were once happy. It will be a labor dispute in Melbridge and a tobacconist which provides a thread Ranier will follow as he tries to unravel his inner torment and discover the key to who he truly is, and the happiness he must have once had. The ending rewards our hearts with a lasting memory of love shared by all who watch this loveliest of films.

A fabulous supporting cast inculdes Philip Dorn, Henry Travers, Reginald Owen and Una O'Conner. But it is Ronald Colman and Greer Garson who are unforgettable as Smithy and Paula. This deeply touching film is widely available in both VHS and DVD and is a must see film for anyone the least bit sentimental or romantic. Truly one of the great films of all time, with a warmth and tenderness rarely seen onscreen. Beautiful.",1255219200,,5550,4.611336032388664
1248768,5,B000021Y6L,"Not many novelists have had a better and more fruitful relationship with Hollywood than James Hilton, author of the 1941 novel on which this film, starring Ronald Colman and Greer Garson, is based. Hilton's 1933 bestseller ""Lost Horizon"" was turned into one of the great romantic fantasy-adventures (nominated for 7 Oscars) of all time by Frank Capra in 1937; his 1934 ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"" was filmed in that well-regarded year of 1939 by Sam Wood, also received 7 Oscar nominations including a win for Robert Donat as Best Actor; Hilton won an Oscar himself for his screenplay of ""Mrs. Miniver"" three years later, which also won the Leading Actress award for Greer Garson, and Best Picture. Everything he touched for a decade or so seemed to turn to gold - or at least silver.

""Random Harvest"" isn't quite as well remembered as the other films I mentioned, though it also received a lucky 7 Oscar bids, winning none in that year of ""Miniver""'s dominance. It's the story of a shell-shocked World War I veteran (Ronald Colman - at 51 just a might too old to be convincing as a young soldier in the early parts of the film) who escapes from a mental hospital during the confusion and celebration of Armistice Day and falls in with a young dancehall performer, Paula (Garson), who christens the memory-impaired and stuttering man ""Smithy"". An accident in which Smithy knocks down a man as he's being searched for leads the two to leave the town of Melford and travel west to a small village in the hopes of Smithy getting well and retrieving his memory. He doesn't, but he and Paula soon fall in love, marry, and have a child, and he begins a career as a writer. On his way to meet a publisher in Liverpool, he gets hit by a car, falls down, and remembers who he was - but loses his recent past, and Paula. How Smithy, now wealthy scion of industry Charles Rainier, and Paula find each other again you should find out for yourself.

Simply put, ""Random Harvest"" is my favorite tearjerker of it's era. LeRoy's direction and the camerawork are simple, smooth and never ostentatious - sure it's got the typically lovely MGM ""house style"" but this is a film entirely focused on character, feeling, memory, loss. If you've never seen it before, or read the book, you'll experience quite an amazing couple of ""shock"" scenes, which are hard for me to judge properly now having seen the film 8 or 10 times but which do seem absolutely right in this kind of melodrama - nothing is really overdone here despite a certain silliness in the concept as the film runs towards it's glorious ending. The film removes a good chunk of the political content that the book is full of - which is probably all for the best when it comes to current audiences, it feels much more relevant as a purely romantic story about two individuals struggling to find the real truths in each other. The whole structure of the film is different as well - the novel is told in flashbacks, which would in the film be hard to do without the central revelation coming too soon; and the role of Kitty, Charles Rainier's young niece who falls for him and is about to marry him, is lessened somewhat in the film (though her central importance as a reminder to Charles that ""something"" is missing in his new life, something from those years he has lost, remains) while a whole subplot involving Smithy and Paula living with a clergyman in London is removed entirely. As I said - the concentration is entirely on the love story and as such it achieves a resonance and intensity that is awfully rare.

Much of this intensity is of course attributable to the lead performances of Colman, measured and never getting to the Barrymore-esque hamminess that he could be prone to, and especially Garson who I think gives the performance of her career here. Her Paula is the essence of the good, self-sacrificing person taken to a fairly ridiculous extreme - but Garson pulls it off with intelligence and real energy, she's a powerful force of life throughout and doesn't waver when ""Smithy"" eventually comes into his own as her equal - and she makes you believe that she could, in fact, wait a good chunk of a lifetime and singlemindedly work towards a dream that in the end seems almost mystical as it turns fantasy to awakening...",1252800000,,4275,4.629776021080369

There is melodrama in this movie and a more than subtle anti war sentiment, but at it's heart RANDOM HARVEST is a romance whose major theme is about the power of love..it's controlling power and it's power to heal.

For those who see this film for the first time there is a surprise twist more than halfway through it, and an ending so touching it will bring tears to your eyes. I won't divulge the plot but just say that it's the story of memory and love, lost and regained. Ronald Coleman gives a fine performance in this movie despite being perhaps a bit old for the role.

That, too, was a fine film but a frustrating one to watch. This, too, has its frustrations as Greer Garson holds back information that you and I couldn't have the strength to do.

In all the time that passes in the story- about 15 years - no one ages! They still look the same! Also, Ronald Colman, an actor who was 40 or 50 years old, playing a young 20s guy??

Overall, however, it's a good story that keeps your interest, even if it suspends belief. How many times you'd watch this depends on how much these type of stories appeal to you.

1248779,3,B000021Y6L,"My search for the perfect romantic comedy continues with this 1942 drama of love found, lost and rediscovered. Colman, looking rather middle aged, plays a World War I British office wounded in the trenches who has lost his memory and is stuck in an asylum. Greer Garson, who is lovely, befriends him for reasons that are not very clear. They fall in love, marry and have a child.
Then on a trip of Liverpool, Colman's character is hit by a car. He recovers his lost memory but loses all recollection of the past three years including his marriage.
Now he's a wealthy landowner, businessman and ultimately member of parliament. His faithful secretary and right-hand woman turns out to be abandoned wife Garson who lives to be near him and waits patiently for the man she married to reappear.
Will Colman remember his lost love? Will these two find love? Will tomorrow be Monday and the next day Tuesday?
The acting in this movie is quite old-fashioned and lots of British stiff upper lips are in evidence. The ""sex"" is sexless and Colman's character especially is rather passive. There isn't much spark between the characters. But the movie remains rather sweet and innocent and the ending is touching.
I'm still looking for that perfect romance but this is not a total waste of time.",1231027200,,1283,4.757847533632287

1248787,5,B000021Y6L,"Yes, this is a tearjerker. But no way is it a simple ""chick flick"". This movie has two protagonists, one male, one female. Each of them has something they want desperately, and though their goals are slightly different, the motivations behind them speak to the hopes of every human being.

The second half of the movie focuses on the secret wish of a secretary to the rich Charles Rainier. The first half focuses on an equally desperate desire by wounded World War I vet Smithy. Either half in itself makes an interesting story. Bound by what the two haves have in common, the story becomes a classic that will resonate long after the credits roll.

James Hilton (who wrote the novel this movie was based on), had a unique and special talent for getting at the the heart of what drives human beings most deeply: the need to connect and to belong. One of the most touching moments in this film is a scene in which the mute and amnesiac Smithy is brought face to face with an elderly couple. They have lost their son in the War and travel to the sanitorium, mistakenly believing that he might be Smithy. As the two old people sadly shake their heads and turn away, actor Ronald Coleman stretches out his hand, and makes a small gesture toward them. It's a little thing, very staged, and it could never work in a film today, but its candid pathos is so touching, I've never forgotten it.

I'm so glad I finally got to see this film.  Coleman with his little pencil mustache was nominated for Best Actor for the film.  While James Cagny would take home the trophy for ""Yankee Doodle Dandy,"" Coleman turns in an excellent understated performance as the amnesia victim called ""Smithy"" and Charles Rainer, the wealthy businessman.  Greer Garson shines on screen as Paula, the British actress who befriends Coleman, marries him and has his son.  The early scenes with her witty repartee as she tries to draw out the taciturn Smithy are charming.  Susan Peters was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her role as Kitty, the young girl who wants Rainer to marry her.  Teresa Wright took home the trophy that year for Mrs. Miniver.  But Peters' story is touching, being paralyzed in a hunting accident two years later and dying at age 31.  As Kitty, she is full of youthful optimism and then has a great scene where she lets Charles go.  Philip Dorn who was in ""I Remember Mama"" and ""Paris After Dark"" plays Paula's friend Dr. Jonathan Benet in a touching cameo.  Irish actress Una Connor who was in ""The Invisible Man"" also has a nice cameo as the tobacconist.  Mervyn Roy was nominated for the Best Director Oscar that year, but saw William Wyler take home the trophy for ""Mrs. Miniver.""  Roy went on to direct ""Mister Roberts"" in 1955 and ""Gypsy"" in 1962.  He took home the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award in 1975.

It sounds absolutely impossible, but that is what Random Harvest is about. Charles Rainer (Ronald Colman) was a soldier in WWI when a shell went off and left him with no memory of his life. He does not even remember his name; his adopted moniker is John Smith. When the news of the end of the war reaches the assylum where he is kept, John manages to escape and meets a friendly redhead in the street. Paula (Greer Garson) takes a liking to the strange man, dons him ""Smithy"" and takes him away with her to start a new life. They marry and all seems well until Smithy goes for a job in the city. He has an accident that brings his memory back but destroys the three years he lived after the war.

Random Harvest exhibits the talent of many amazing figures of classic Hollywood. Colman is tremedous in his part. He brings the character to life but appropraitely shifts his personality with each memory lapse. It is a difficult role, but he makes it look easy. Garson is absolutely beautiful; each emotion is strongly conveyed in a subtle way. The story by James Hilton is an enchanting tale of love and loss.

1248791,5,B000021Y6L,"Kidding aside, this piece of romantic nostalgia recently prompted mcHaiku's husband to morph into a convincing *Smitty* - - the role of the WWI soldier played by Ronald Colman in RANDOM HARVEST.  In real life Colman was swooned over by women; in this movie he played the part of an amnesiac just as the war ended.  In the excitement of victory he eluded the hospital guards and was rescued by Greer Garson, a beautiful music hall dancer of unusual refinement.  And the story builds from there to a satisfactory close.  When I question this cotton-candy ending, asking  ""You must believe in Fairies, too?""  he replies, ""In this world maybe that's not such a bad idea?""

He contends that today's movies don't have real storylines.  An accurate translation is that no film matches his favorite, LOST HORIZON. Interestingly, James Hilton authored both books from which the two films were made.  We do not ask if we saw this film in 1943 >OR< if we also suffer from amnesia, >OR< are we just too ancient to remember?  We won't forget the perfection of Greer, the charming persistence of Susan Peters and the suave syllables of Ronald Colman - - or the sharp black & white photography with some moody grays!  RANDOM HARVEST exerts an emotional hold on us that takes us back through our own 'pea soup fog' of past decades.  It is not to be missed.

The radiant Garson was never better playing Paula, a woman whose imperishable love motivates acts of supreme self-sacrifice. And Colman, playing essentially two roles, manages to elicit our sympathy as he journeys from shell-shocked mental patient to industrialist prince, a man with a nagging sense that the hole in his past is the key to real happiness.

1248803,5,B000021Y6L,"""Random Harvest"", a novel by James Hilton, was an enormous hit when it appeared in the late thirties. The story of a war veteran who suffers amnesia and marries the same girl twice, however contrived, tore at the heart strings.

MGM purchased the rights and the film broke box office records in 1942.  Filmed in typical MGM style, which means a syrupy score, artificial sets and soft focus camerawork, it is beautifully mounted and therefore completely unrealistic but it doesn't matter. A cynical view is easy to adopt but ultimately irrelevent. When I showed the film to a friend recently, she was riveted to the twists and turns of the plot and reduced to tears by the end. After 60 years it still works.

This is possibly Greer Garson's best performance. In contrast to Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer and so many MGM stars, Garson was a trained actress and in the right circumstances, she could transcend the artificial settings and really create a character. In this film, she does just that and Ronald Colman, who is much too old for his part, matches her. His underacting, handsome face, modesty and overwhelming magnetism and charm win you over and together they make a memorable team.  Garson was on record that this was her favourite film and that she loved making it. It shows. The rapport of the leads added so much to the onscreen relationship.  She also performs a song and dance, an imitation of Harry Lauder which she carries off very well.  Special mention too of the tragic Susan Peters who superbly plays the girl Colman almost marries. By the way, LISTEN to the film. You may never hear the English language spoken so beautifully. The leads' voices are a large part of the magic.

The DVD print is good and the package contains a few extras which are of marginal interest.  The Lux Radio version is irrelevant when you can view the original and the Garson film trailers are really a marketing exercise.  The 2 shorts are of historical interest.",1126396800,,1962,4.730205278592376
1248804,5,B000021Y6L,"Random Harvest is the classic double-amnesia yarn, quite effective due to the immense talents of Ronald Colman and Greer Garson.  Colman is one of my favorite actors from the olden days, one who could play anything from a rugged hero to an intellectual professor convincingly.  It's a shame he's not known to modern audiences; in my book he's right up there with Gary Cooper, Spencer Tracy, and Jimmy Stewart.  The few of his movies available today include Talk Of The Town, Lost Horizon, Champagne for Caesar, and Random Harvest.

Here Colman plays an English World War One veteran who escapes from an asylum with a severe case of amnesia.  Greer Garson (Mrs. Miniver, Madame Curie) is Paula, an entertainer who takes him in and calls him Smithy.  She decides he's better off not returning to the asylum, and takes him to the country, where they start a new life together, fall in love, marry, and start a family.

After three years Smithy goes to Liverpool to answer a job offer, where he's struck by a truck in the street.  The shock brings back the memory of  his identity, at the cost of that of his new life, wife and all.  He returns home an heir of substantial wealth and responsibility, and as years pass he takes over the family business, and eventually becomes engaged.  But his three year memory gap haunts him and he breaks off the engagement, suspecting his life can never be complete, failing at every attempt to bring back memories of his lost time.

During the second half of the film the plot takes a new turn as  Paula, having discovered his real identity, takes a job as his secretary.  On the advice of his former doctor, played by Philip Dorn (the Papa in I Remember Mama), she can't reveal her true identity to Smithy.  This becomes really engrossing.  If you let yourself in on this - if you're a romantic, and let yourself be absorbed by the well-performed story - you're in for a heart-wrenching experience, an allegory for any lost love experience, as she attempts to live with him unrecognized as his former wife.  But I think you will find it well worth while at the end.

The supporting cast also includes a favorite character actor, Henry Travers (It's A Wonderful Life, Ball of Fire, On Borrowed Time, etc. etc.), Susan Peters, Reginald Owen, Melville Cooper, Alan Napier, Peter Lawford and Arthur Shields (who was Barry Fitzgerald's brother).",1121817600,,2375,4.709443099273607

Starring Greer Garson in what I think is her most luminous portrayal (I prefer her in this to Mrs. Miniver which I think is great also.  But I like her character's nobility and genteelity better in this one).  Ronald Colman as the suffering amnesiac gives a poignant and touching portrayal.  As a matter of fact, the entire movie which comes in at 126 minutes is a great classic from the golden era of Hollywood.  Understandably a huge box office success at the time of its release, this movie stands the test of time and is never artificial or ""soapy""....thanks to the intelligent screenplay, acting and direction.  The film also contains one of the finest ending shots of a film ever made.  I won't give it away.  You'll have to watch it and find out for yourself.  Hint:  Greer Garson's etherealness and fine acting ability is prominent!  The mastering of the DVD is outstand in brilliant black and white.

1248807,5,B000021Y6L,"The book is slightly different, due to the exigencies of the plot the screenwriters had to divulge a certain surprise in the movie because celluloid's visual nature left them no way to tell the story properly.  In the book you don't find out who Charles Rainier's secretary is until the very last pages.  In the movie, you know as soon as the door opens and Greer Garson enters.  She's fine in this role, and she and Ronald Colman have a chemistry together that she just doesn't have with Walter Pidgeon.  The one thing in this story that I just don't buy is why, why, why would Paula marry a man escaped from a mental hospital?  Oh yes, eventually his good nature becomes obvious, but any sensible woman would have turned and ran once she realized he had just stepped out of an asylum and was still obviously feeble in the head.  However, if she had not married him, where would the story be, so I'm ready to swallow it, and it helps that Garson really makes you believe she's interested in Colman, not just congenially, then romantically, but there's a sexual spark between them right from the beginning.  And this is heightened by the way she is protective of him, as though he were her son.  I love the way she calls him ""Smithy.""  And that country cottage they live in is also out of this world isn't it?

When Colman becomes Charles Rainier that's where his real acting begins, he manages to convince you that he is indeed a genius businessman and the head of a querulous family, and yet still somewhere in his head is the foggy period in which he lived his life as ""Smithy"" and loved and was loved by a woman he just can't remember.  No wonder poor Kitty (the seductive Susan Peters, quite winning in the part) doesn't stand much of a chance with Rainier, alluring and confident as she is.

You just hope and hope that somehow he will regain his memory (or lose his memory, depending on what side you take on the memory loss debate).  Every time I see the film I still fall victim to the suspense built in to the story, and the bravura acting of Garson and Colman go the distance every time.  Yes, I would agree with the many reviewers who have commented that actually both Garson and Colman are about ten years older than the characters they are supposed to be playing.  But suffering has ennobled them both, and I don't think the audience would have accepted Paula if played by a young girl.  The mature, sophisticated Greer Garson is perfectly cast.",1114992000,,2459,4.479820627802691
1248808,5,B000021Y6L,"One of the all time great four hanky tearjerkers, ""Random Harvest"" (1942) is a bittersweet tale of love and sacrifice, set against that mythical backdrop of jolly ol' Britain that never was. It stars Ronald Colman as Charles Rainier, a war veteran who is suffering from amnesia. Paula Ridgway (Greer Garson) is the unfortunate dance-hall hostess who falls in love and marries Charles - renamed John Smith. But true love never runs a straight course and John and Paula's brief chance at divine happiness is overturned when a car accident jogs John's memory. He returns to the life he once knew, oblivious that his new and fragile world with Paula ever existed.
Colman's gentlemanly congeniality, as always, astounds with genuine canter and frank grace and maturity - qualities soarly lacking from the leading men of today's cinema. Garson is charming; blowing in as a summer's breeze and just as passionate, divine and charming as Colman. Director Mervyn LeRoy modulates each plot point and circumstance with subtle panache and quiet rectitude for his subject matter. There's never a point at which the melodrama becomes cheap, exploitive or overwrought. Ah, but the years may pass and memories fade, but ""Random Harvest"" has proven to be that rarest of eternal cinematic treasures - genuine and outstanding in every way.
Warner Home Video delivers a marvelous DVD transfer. The gray scale has been impeccably rendered with fine tonality and attention to fine detail. The picture is generally sharp and pleasing on the eyes. Blacks are very rich, deep and solid. Whites are on the whole clean.

The audio is mono and very nicely balanced. A hint of background hiss is detected in quiescent scenes, but again, for a film element that is pushing 70 plus years, there's really nothing to complain about here.

Script, acting and production are great (we'll overlook hollywood's typical looking at england thru' rosetinted glasses). The DVD is presented in packaging similar to ""goodbye mr. chips"" and ""mrs. miniver"", and the extras are welcome (two wartime shorts which while they have nothing to do with the film give a taste of the period and the radio version of the story).

When he described to me the basic premise of the film I was kind of resistant to the film because it sounded it to me like, well, schmaltz.  On paper that's how ""Random Harvest"" sounds but as executed by director Mervyn LeRoy it is a very rewarding experience.  MGM knew how to manufacture this kind of material and make it palatable.  The film is also enhanced by superlative performances by Ronald Colman and primarily Greer Garson, who also won an Oscar for ""Mrs. Miniver"" the year of this film's release.  Garson manages to cut through the more saccharine aspects of the story and make the story more compelling.  I would also like to reiterate what a previous reviewer from Australia stated and say she has a great pair of legs. Colman for his part is most effective in the earlier portions of the film when his character is in the throes of amnesia.  As good as Colman is, however, it seemed to me that he may have been a little old for the part he was playing.  This is most apparent when he shared the screen with Susan Peters.  I wasn't just thinking that he looks old enough to be her father but possibly her grandfather.

There are many unexpected twists to the plot, saving it from being ""sappy and sentimental"", and it is blessed with lovely cinematography (by Joseph Ruttenberg, who also filmed and received an Oscar for ""Mrs. Miniver""), an atmospheric score by Herbert Stothart, and sensitive direction by Mervyn LeRoy.
There are some numbers connected with this film: It is # 36 in the American Film Institute's ""Top Romances"", it was nominated for 6 Academy Awards (Best Picture and Best Director lost to ""Mrs. Miniver"", and others were Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress with the excellent Susan Peters as Kitty, Screenplay, and Score), and Ronald Colman was my mother's # 1 heartthrob, as he was for so many women during those golden years of the cinema.

It was the end of the First World War, and the ""asylum"" for war shell shock cases in Great Britain was full of problems.  John Smith was only one of them,  He lost his memory due to the horror of war, and escaped the hospital in the excitement of war's end.

Paula (Greer Garson) gave his life meaning again, and then, on a trip to Liverpool, he was hit by a car and lost it once more.  But, unfortunately, he lost that which he had most recently lived through--the current three years--and remembered the rest.

There are flaws in the science of memory loss, but the story is good nonetheless.

The story is Garson's effort to help him regain his memory and his lost love.

Colman and Garson were once both great actors--the first rank.  This movie was a good one.  No filthy language to prop it up, or gutter histrionics, but--strangely enough--they managed to tell the story anyway, in spite of all those restraints.

This story of amnesia could have seemed ridiculous or far-fetched, but in the hands of all concerned it works very well.  Colman is his smooth, classy self, believable at every stage of the story.  But Garson is the real treasure here, creating a subdued, warm portrait of a woman who knows she must wait, perhaps forever, to have her love returned to her.

We develop genuine interest in the characters played by Ronald Colman, a WWI English soldier who is a shellshocked amnesiac, and Greer Garson, an English music hall singer.  Garson sees Colman wandering dazed and tired on the street, feels sorry for him and takes him under her wing.  They fall in love, get married, have a child, and appear ready to live happily ever after as Mr. and Mrs. John Smith.
Up to this point the story interest is Colman's amnesia and Garson's help in making his life living with this affliction bearable. The story takes a dramatic turn when Colman is struck by a taxi in Liverpool and regains his memory, forgetting Garson and their child.  In fact he is a rich industrialist and takes up his former life.  It appears as if Garson will be forgotten, but we know this is a 1942 Hollywood production and we are only moderately surprised when Garson reappears in his life as his secretary.
By saying this film is not a tear jerker in my opening comments, I have revealed the ending of this film, which while not surprising, given the nature of the film, nonetheless provides dramatic intensity and genuine interest for the viewer.
This is an old fashioned Hollwood film which has stood up well over time.

If you haven't see ""Random Harvest"" rent it, buy it, keep it.  You won't forget it.  Or read the book by James Hilton.",1022112000,,980,4.244565217391305
1248849,5,B000021Y6L,"This 1942 five hanky tearjerker garnered seven Academy Award nominations and was the number four box office hit of the year. It is a wonderful, sentimental and romantic love story that captures the heart of the viewer. Corny? Sure, but so what. The film is totally absorbing, fueled by wonderful performances by the velvet voiced Ronald Colman and the beautiful Greer Garson.
The story revolves around a shell shocked, World War I vet (Ronald Colman), who is suffering from amnesia and convalescing in a sanitorium. He simply cannot remember who he is. One day, he simply walks out of that sanatorium and runs into a dance hall entertainer (Greer Garson), who takes a shine to him. Realizing that he has been under a great strain, she looks after him and, before you know it, they fall in love and marry. Now Mr. and Mrs. John Smith, they rent a little cottage in a quaint country village, and he begins a career as a writer. They have a baby boy. All is rosy and well with their world for three years. One day, John travels to Liverpool, where he is struck by a car. The end result is that he remembers who he was before the war, but has no recollection of the last three years.
It turns out that he is wealthy industrialist Charles Rainier. He goes home and takes over the reins of his business. He ultimately engages the services of a wonderful secretary, who turns out to be his wife, though he is unaware of having had any relationship with her, and she does not disclose it to him under advice of the sanatorium psychiatrist, wonderfully played by Phillip Dorn. Steadfast, she patiently waits for the day that he will remember all that they had together.
What happens to them is memorable in this story of love lost and found. It is, no doubt, a highly sentimental and manipulative film, as its intention to tug at one's heart strings and render one immobilized by tears. It definitely succeeds in that department. It is also hugely entertaining. They certainly don't  make 'em as they used to. All in all, a wonderful film. Fans of Ronald Colman and Greer Garson will love it, as will all those who love classic films.",1009065600,,2125,4.57742782152231
1248850,5,B000021Y6L,"Whenever I see all the mediocre films that are being released on DVD today, (with exceptions, of course) I cannot understand why films like these are not being released in this format. This is a wonderful movie adaptation from James Hilton's (""Lost Horizon"", ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"") novel of the same title. The movie does not follow the progression of the book but one can easily see that filming it that way would not have been possible. I agree that Ronald Colman is a bit old for the early parts of the movie but that didn't stop him from giving a virtuoso performance.  Greer Garson is once again in one of her memorable performances as a wonderful, caring and kind, dance-hall girl who took care and pity on a shell-shocked and speech-impedded amnesiac soldier from the trenches of World War I.  There is nobility and sacrifice and goodness and decency in this film. It is one of those movies where the traditional and necessary clash of good and evil is conveniently left on the wayside and everybody is just charming and pleasant as can be.
It is said that this movie was one of cinematographer Joseph Ruttenberg's personal favorite. And of all the films made by Greer Garson, including ""Mrs. Miniver"", she always said that this film was her favorite as well and was convinced that it is one of the best half-dozen love stories ever written. Director Mervyn LeRoy reputedly said that between the two stars of this movie Garson and Colman--never has the English language been spoken more beautifully on film. And few would argue with these after they've seen this movie.",1006041600,,1574,4.761904761904762
1248851,3,B000021Y6L,"Years ago, Carol Burnett used to serve up comedic treatments of old movies, as a kid I saw her version of ""Random Harvest"", about a shellshocked amnesiac WWI soldier who wanders away from the mental hospital and into a romance and marriage with an amiable music hall singer. However, a chance accident has him regain his previous memory only to forget about his most recent past and marriage. Will he ever remember the girl he left behind him? As you may imagine, CB had a lot of fun bonking the soldier over and over on the head to make him go in and out of amnesia.
Well, then I read the novel by Hilton, and enjoyed that, so I was all set to love the ""real"" movie with Ronald Colman and Greer Garson. However, I was disappointed. Dare I say it? Boring. Yes, it just seemed to be far too long. And while I could buy Greer Garson as a secretary in the latter part of the movie, I just couldn't see her as a music hall singer (although I think she did actually start out as one).
So, my harvest was not what I hoped for. But you can go ahead to see if you think better of it.",997228800,,1075,4.123809523809523
1248852,5,B000021Y6L,"They don't make movies like ""Random Harvest"" anymore. More the pity. I had waited years to see this movie again, and just as the first time, I cried. It's one of the most beautiful, touching, sensitive and satisfying movies I've seen. I had also read the James Hilton book (similarly titled) upon which the movie was based, and found it just as enjoyable, even though it was told from another point of view. To make the movie precisely as the book was written would have been difficult and not as poignant. I loved both and rate both five stars. Moviemakers, here's a movie to remake. Can you best this version? A hard act to follow.",994723200,,633,4.51304347826087
1248853,5,B000021Y6L,"Oh yes, this is my favourite film of all time. Time... this is the essence of the movie.  It was made in wartime and the opening sequence is set just in wartime, at the end of the war to end all wars.  Time is lost, nearly 20 years of it, as Paula waits for Smithy to unlock his memory. The key fits the lock in the door to the cottage and the love that was lost is recovered but the time never can be.  A moment which makes the hardest of hearts weep, but is it for joy or in sorrow?  It is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.  Or is it?  Being transfixed by the skill of Garson and Colman provides the answer, but it will not be painless.",981504000,,667,3.832116788321168
1248854,5,B000021Y6L,"This movie really grabs you.  The story could be made again, but there are no actors today who could play these parts the way Ronald Coleman and Green Garson did.  They were at the top of their craft when that meant something  real in Hollywood -- not that they had good publicists, but that they could  tell a story without moving a muscle, screaming or taking off their  clothes.  Their acting is a prime example of ""a picture speaks a  thousand words""..  And this movie has two hours of unforgettable  pictures of intelligent, sensitive characters.  This is an excellent movie  for crying, laughing, yelling, feeling better about yourself, and asking  your friends afterward -- ""what would you have done when...""  Rent it, buy it, but by all means watch it!",957571200,,760,4.753846153846154
1248855,5,B000021Y6L,"A masterful, tearjerking film based on the James Hilton novel, this film is probably the epitome of the vast quanity of popular romances produced at MGM during WWII. Colman is the shell-shocked WWI amnesiac who's made happy by beautiful music hall dancer Garson; he ultimately regains his memory and forgets about Garson and their child....What still works, inspite of the dated, contrived plot is the universal appeal of the struggle for true love; the film touches all of us who have known the dreams of impossible romance. RANDOM HARVEST may be melodramatic but the performances of both Ronald Colman and Greer Garson are amazingly full of vitality (Colman was 51 here) and the dialogue serves as a showcase for the stars beautiful voices. RANDOM HARVEST was nominated for 7 AA.",944697600,,781,5.015384615384615
1248856,4,B000021Y6L,"I first saw this movie years ago on tv and fell in love with it. I have since read the book, which is also very good but the movie is just a bit different. Mostly in the point of view in wihich it is told and I think the  movie is definitely the better of the two.  Invite some friends over, make  a big bowl of popcorn and be sure to have plenty of kleenex on hand, this  is a classic that is sure to leave you feeling wonderful.

1248858,5,B000021Y6L,"I have seen this movie over 100 times.  This movie could not be recast and shot today.  Ronald Coleman is irreplaceable as Smithy.  And what about Greer Garson's saloon act, not to mention her death defying shoulders  displayed in that unbelievable deltoid hugging dress.  Woof!  Buy the film,  invite some friends, and see the greatest film you and your friends have  never seen! The ultimate sleeper!  Have pillows and punching bags available  for punching and smacking Charles Rainier to help jostle his memory.  Have  lots of Kleenexes for the girls, and bar rags for the boys.  This movie is  definite second honeymoon viewing. And if you are not married, have a ring  handy and be on your knees for when the lights come up.
