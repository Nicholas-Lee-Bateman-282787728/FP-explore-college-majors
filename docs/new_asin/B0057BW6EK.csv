4595110,1,B0057BW6EK,"Overall, the dvds seemed to be kind of a low-rent production.  I'm willing to overlook the home video-esque production value for a good workout, but was disappointed there too.  First, the strength training dvd is lead by a super-skinny blond with gigantor fake boobs -- just what every pregnant woman is looking for: a workout with a Hooters waitress.  Plus, the workout is awful, lots of exercises that have you do 30+ reps in a row of something (can we break this up into sets?).  In addition, it did not seem well tailored to a proper and safe prenatal workout.  Annoyed, I moved on to the yoga dvd, hoping for better.  The Hooters-girl was gone, but the yoga routine seemed disjointed and slow paced (even for a beginner).  Honestly, I gave up prior to the Pilates dvd, so in fairness, I can't comment on that. in short, save your money and opt for one of the many other great prenatal workout dvds on the market!",1326499200,33,918,4.527272727272727
4595111,2,B0057BW6EK,"I was very excited when I first rec'd this dvd workout. However, I'm disappointed because the quality is pretty bad (I thought it'll be HD or something nice) and the workout is just too boring.",1326153600,,193,4.542857142857143
4595112,5,B0057BW6EK,"I thoroughly enjoy this workout DVD.  With the three different options: yoga, pilates, fit and toned, it gives you enough variety to switch up your workout and not get bored.  Within each of these DVDs the workouts are broken down by trimester and then within that there are even more options.  The options can become overwhelming, but once you go through them once you can figure out which ones are best for you.

The length of each of the workouts is also on the menu, so that you know approximately how long each one will take.  They are as short as 15 minutes and as long as 60 minutes (the yoga workouts are the longest).  This is great for me because I don't have time to workout for 45-60 minutes, but the 15-30 workouts are just enough.  I feel the burn and still have time to do other things.

The fit and toned DVD is my personal favorite.  I don't enjoy Yoga as much and I do find this Yoga DVD to be a little odd.  It's fairly easy for a yoga novice, and I am giving it a chance.  The pilates DVD is good as well.  It all depends on what you want to do that day.  Overall I am very pleased with this purchase and am looking forward to the second and third trimester versions.",1326153600,7,1187,4.176211453744493
4595113,5,B0057BW6EK,"I like different things to do and here you have a chance to do yoga, pilates and a general workout, all of which are designed with prenatal fitness and health in mind.  For instance, the yoga is made for each trimester to take care of morning sickness in the first trimester, the pilates has each trimester and modifications along the way and changes in what should be done or avoided and the fitness has three models showing each trimester and what to do.

Well done.",1326067200,5,468,4.4941176470588236
4595114,4,B0057BW6EK,These CD's worked well for my needs.  They are simple to follow and just knowing that I am doing the right exercises is alot off my mind.  Highly recommend them.,1324252800,,161,4.333333333333333
4595115,5,B0057BW6EK,"Good selection of different workouts to do that I can find to do on different days and depending how I feel.  Sometimes I am looking for more of a workout and go with the cardio, other days want to focus on certain issues or stretch and put on the yoga and the pilates is nice between the two.  Overall there is so much between the videos that you can definately find more than enough to make this total set worthwhile.",1323561600,13,419,4.225

The selection of things to do (yoga/pilates/strength & cardio) is great and I am able to choose what I want to do easily.  If I have morning sickness or just feeling not up for more of a workout, the yoga is perfect.  When I want some more of a workout, the other two are there.  Nicely done.",1320796800,15,351,3.9714285714285715
4595117,5,B0057BW6EK,"This three DVD set has been a nice purchase for me and has really helped.  It covers a broad range of things to do.

The Yoga DVD is targeted for each trimester (three sections) with yoga to help with various things such as Morning Sickness.  The routines I have done so far (late 1st into early 2nd) have been very helpful.  Gentle and relaxing workouts.

The Pilates DVD is also broken down into three trimesters with modifications and recommendations for each level in the introduction.  It is a nice active workout.

The last general fitness DVD has a range of workouts with all three trimesters at the same time.  Three people at different trimester) and the main instructor (1st trimester) leads you through and points out all the modifications you should be doing.

Very worthwhile and helpful purchase.",1317081600,44,810,4.811594202898551

I bought it in the middle of the pregnancy but I reccomended to do something like this since the begining. I wasn't a yoga expert before pregnancy neither after, so for the price I got it ~13 it worth all the money.",1421452800,,302,4.05

4595125,3,B0057BW6EK,"I should have read the description more clearly. So far the Pilates and Cardio, Strength are pretty good, short enough that I can work up the energy to do them but tough enough that I'm sore the next day, the modifications are easy to follow if you need them and while it does look a little eighties I think these two dics work fine for any moderately fit - to slightly out of shape pregnant women. I am normal quite fit but a combination of too much travel (too much eating out & not enough exercise) and our long awaited honeymoon I was a bit more out of shape and chubby to start my pregnancy. I was also extremely tired during my first trimester so working out more or less did not start again until early in my second trimester. So with all that in mind these two discs have been perfect to get me moving and exercising again.

The Yoga Disc however is CRAP! I'm not a huge yogi but I know quite a few poses and am relatively flexible still, the modifications and ""flow"" to these routines are awful! Not only does it look and sound like a bad home video the narrator (yes narrator) is not the person doing the workout and she talks the whole time!! No quiet breathing time, no actual work on your breathing with the poses (which I was hoping for since I'm terribly at managing my breathing). While I know that the description says not your traditional flow vinyasa yoga I did not think it would be quite so bad! I can do better just doing poses on my own.

Overall I think the Strength & Cardio and the Pilates are worth it but if your getting this mostly for the yoga, DON'T!",1412121600,,1581,4.249169435215947

4595127,1,B0057BW6EK,Didn't use these at all after trying once. The work outs had no flow to them and were way to easy for 1st and even 2nd trimester. May have been appropriate for 3rd trimester but didn't bother trying at that point.,1405296000,,213,4.219512195121951

4595129,1,B0057BW6EK,"I was so excited for this and what a waste of money.  This seems like it is from the 80s, super outdated! It would be a great SNL skit. I am not the fittest person and I thought these exercises were lame and driven more towards geriatric. Oh and the yoga....no transition between moves.

4595132,3,B0057BW6EK,My wife said this was decent. She used it a couple times. She said the bowel movement yoga was effective and it helped eliminate constipation. Overall I think she was okay with it but she only used it twice before giving up on the working out and just did her thing working all day. Wouldn't buy again but that is not the fault of the DVD but of a great wonderful woman who tries things she may or may not do more than a couple times.,1396915200,,434,4.058139534883721

4595136,2,B0057BW6EK,I only did one of the videos on here and I put them away. You were on the floor for a move then standing up and it kept going back and forth like that. Too much up and down for a pregnant woman and these are supposed to be for pregnant woman. The up and down also triggered my morning sickness and I ended up having to lay down the rest of the night.,1391126400,,350,3.7432432432432434

4595138,2,B0057BW6EK,I had done plenty of in class yoga sessions and I was hoping this could supplement when I couldn't make it to a class.  This set is horrible!  The props look cheap and the tempo is SO SLOW.  Wish I could get my money back...,1387152000,,224,3.933333333333333
4595139,1,B0057BW6EK,"This has got to be one of the worst DVD sets I've ever seen! They were painfully easy and basic.

I was so excited to get it in the mail, that I tried out the Yoga disc immediately. I loved that it had 8 workouts for each trimester, so they were specified to your needs, and had enough so that you wouldn't get bored.

That love stopped as soon as I tried the routines. There is NO flow from one pose to the other. They are all shot in individual takes! Its 2 minutes of getting into a singular position, 1 minute of holding it, and then another 2 minutes of getting out of it. Not to mention that every single position is modified to be as gentle (useless) as possible. I understand if this was for the third trimester, and for a very beginner, but these were the first trimester routines! No talk of how to make the poses easier or harder to suit your ability either. They are SLOW, BORING, and I honestly can't see how anyone who isn't bedridden and spending their first day of their life with any motion would benefit from such limited range of motion stretches.

If you have ever done any yoga before in your life, and you want anything beyond a mild stretch (or even, I don't know, building the strength and stamina you will need to get through childbirth!) SKIP THIS PROGRAM!

Then I decided to try the strength training video, thinking it was more my style. IT IS STEP AEROBICS!!!! That's right, who needs real strength when you can TOE TAP your way to fitness!!! Okay, I am being unfair, they threw in a couple moves with 5 lb weights. Again, even if you upped the weight, these are moves that will only challenge first time exercisers.

This is just, all around, the worst workout videos I've ever attempted!",1385942400,2,1718,4.3730407523510975
4595140,2,B0057BW6EK,There was no flow in the sequence of the exercises. It was really choppy and hard to get into. It did not meet my expectations.,1384214400,,127,4.12
4595141,2,B0057BW6EK,I was really excited to get the videos. I tried them but was not thrilled. I am not an advanced athlete but still found the videos to be less than remedial. I might try them again as I get farther along in my pregnancy but for the first and second trimester I will stick to a more rigorous routine.,1383782400,,298,4.067796610169491
4595142,2,B0057BW6EK,Really outdated. The yoga is horrible. I can't get past the unitard the girl is wearing. The cardio instructor is not pregnant.,1383177600,,127,4.818181818181818
4595143,4,B0057BW6EK,This is a great DVD for someone who is a beginner!  I am just starting my second trimester and have never done yoga or Pilates before. Very easy to follow and I find that it gives me a good workout without over exertion.,1382745600,,220,4.116279069767442

4595146,1,B0057BW6EK,"I bought this when I found out I was pregnant. I was hoping for a yoga routine I could pop in my DVD player and do pretty much anywhere (traveling, any room of the house, etc.). Every yoga routine requires extra props (bricks, blankets, chairs, and exposed wall, pillows). If I knew it was going to be that complicated, I wouldn't even have considered it. Plus, I thought it would be very modern based on the picture on the front of the DVD. However, the routines and DVD itself is very outdated. I wish I could return it, but like another reviewer said, not worth the money.",1376524800,2,575,4.383177570093458
4595147,3,B0057BW6EK,"The dvd has plenty of yoga options for all ailments, but I felt the video was horribly boring ( even for yoga ). Also it seemed to be rather old fashioned. Wasn't pleased overall but the workouts are ok.",1376006400,,203,4.230769230769231
4595148,3,B0057BW6EK,"I had every intention of exercising along with these workouts and thought that it would provide some good variety. I've been known to overdue it in the past with routines like P90X, so I wanted to make sure that I had something that would be more gentle and have a slower pace during my pregnancy.

I always watch the video before doing it, so that I can have a general idea of what is expected. I made the mistake of watching the yoga video first and it nearly put me to sleep. The ""exercises"" seemed extremely simple and were little more than supported stretching, in my opinion. This may have felt good on achy days, except that the instructor's voice and delivery was monotonous and annoying, which would have cancelled out the relaxing aspects of the workout. As others have said, the production value was also pretty low, looking like it was filmed with someone's home camera in their basement. I was so turned off that I did not return to the videos for months.

Fortunately, the strength tape had a different instructor and seemed a bit more lively. I would have watched it sooner, had I known that it was not the same instructor as the yoga video. That was not the case, however, and my pregnancy kept me so queasy that I did not have the energy to try it.

I never did get a chance to look at the third video, which is why I am giving it the benefit of the doubt and rating it 3 stars instead of 2. Although, if I was basing it on the Yoga alone, I would only be rating it a 1 star.

Even though, I did not like it, I suppose it may be more useful to women who have very little experience with exercise training.",1375401600,,1622,4.273615635179153
4595149,5,B0057BW6EK,"I used this throughout my pregnancy and was great.  I really loved it.  As I went along I found the yoga very valuable in helping me relax and stretch safely.  It was obvious the instructor was careful in doing so.

The same for the other two titles, the Pilates was as precised as to seperate the second trimester into two and explain the differences.

Both provided good workouts, as did the cardio video with its workouts.

Listen and follow, and all three are highly effective in doing what they are designed to do.",1370217600,,519,4.526881720430108

It does require a bit of extra equipment, normal household things, but I just wasn't aware when I began and I was doing the exercises on a different floor of the house than where all those items would be found (I was upstairs, everything was downstairs). Things like blankets, chairs, and walls were used. And as silly as it may sound, I didn't have an area to work in that also had a clear wall to use. I have space in my room to do the exercises but there is furniture along all the walls, or even my living room...I have a small home with an awkward layout and my couches and tv use all my walls. I mean, its not impossible to do, but I felt I would need to do more rearranging than exercising to get the workout done. I ended up watching the workouts and then just putting together the moves I felt I could do with what I had at the time. So I wasn't recieveing the full benefits of exercises that help with nausea and such because I wanst following them in that specific order.

In fact, when I first did the strength one, I thought, ""This is laughably easy."" I'm pretty active, though I'm not consistent, and I had been training for a half marathon that was the same week that I found out I was pregnant, and I've also made it 2/3 through P90X a few times.

Fast-forward to a few months into my pregnancy, after I had zero time to work out and was starting to feel sluggish when climbing stairs, etc. I tried the strength workouts again and loved them. They're just enough to help keep my muscles feeling strong, especially as I'm carrying around the pregnancy weight. The instructor is annoying, but the workout was great for where I was.

I find the yoga videos, though, really boring and hard to follow. I've tried a couple of different yoga workouts on the video and haven't been able to make it through more than 5 minutes of any of them. I don't feel relaxed, I don't feel that my hips or back are getting the stretches I want them to get, and I just don't see any benefit. I'm doing a semi-regular prenatal yoga class, and the class  is infinitely better for my needs. Maybe this video is too focused on fine movements, but I need to stretch my lower back.

I tried the Pilates videos early on and liked them fine.",1363219200,,1385,4.3565891472868215

I guess it would be okay for someone who is accustomed to a level 1 beginners yoga, but for those of us who like at least a little bit of a challenge (and to get at least a little sweat on!) this sequence  has nothing to offer.  I also tried the pilates and strength training... not impressed with those, either.

Not to mention the DVD says the ONLY way to do the moves is against a flat unobstructed wall facing the TV. I do not have this in my house thus it makes doing the yoga and Pilates DVD near impossible. You also about 8 different items to perform these workouts, prior to the purchase I had a yoga/ pilates mat and some bands but  I wasn't expectingto need thick horse blankets , yoga blocks, and specific pilates bands to perform the moves.

I've done yoga on-and-off for 10 years and that DVD is the farthest thing from a yoga workout I've ever seen...however...The fitness/workout DVD alone is worth your money!

  I've been using the workout DVD for about a month, alternating with hiking the hills in my neighborhood. I considered myself in very good physical shape before my pregnancy, but the DVD actually gets me out of breath in the first few minutes and I actually feel like I'm getting a good workout! I use little 5lb weights, and I actually feel toned and a little sore after I'm done. The Pilates workout on that DVD is also great.

Each one offers routines that you might typically do while not pregnant, with modifications for your changing body and the health and safety of your baby during the pregnancy.  There is an ample number of routines so that you are not stuck doing the same one over and over again.

4595182,2,B0057BW6EK,"If you are an experienced yogi, or are simply looking for a decent practice and something pretty similar to what you were used to before pregnancy, don't waste your money!  I ordered this last week in hopes of being able to use it many different ways with all of the options people have discussed in other reviews, and bought it mostly for the yoga to keep limber and aligned, and for the pilates to stay toned.  While I have not done all of the routines, and have not yet tried the pilates dvd, I am already very disappointed with the yoga dvd.  I have been very active with yoga and piyo for years and this is not at all what I was expecting from other dvd's I've done and the classes I enjoy attending.  The home routines I've enjoyed in pregnancy until Netflix recently dropped ALL fitness from their instant menu, were the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crunch-Yoga-Mama-Prenatal-Yoga/dp/B0001LJCSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crunch Yoga Mama - Prenatal Yoga</a>&nbsp;(LOVED THIS and highly recommend!!), and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crunch-Candlelight-Yoga/dp/B00006FMB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crunch - Candlelight Yoga</a>&nbsp;(LOVED this one too, even in pregnancy.)  While in my first trimester, before I became unable to perform the regular routines anymore, due to back pain that started in trimester 2, I loved the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Shakti/dp/1591791847/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Shakti</a>&nbsp;routines and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heart-Flow-Vinyasa-Yoga-Beginner-Intermediate-Advanced-a-Practice-DVD/dp/B0017093O6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heart Flow Vinyasa Yoga, Beginner, Intermediate & Advanced, a ***Practice DVD***</a>, and many others. What I've watched so far of this dvd set is nothing like the others I've done in the past and very far from what I was looking for. I'm going to just end up buying the Crunch fitness routines mentioned above and I just ordered Shiva Rea's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prenatal-Yoga/dp/B0000BYNMH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prenatal Yoga</a>&nbsp;with hopes that it's as pleasing as her Yoga Shakti.

First, I ordered this because it was released in 2011, so I was hoping for a recent recording, this seems like it was made in the 90's, so it's out of date and very visually unappealing.  It's performed in an extremely old dingy looking venue, where I cannot believe they use the walls as often as they do, considering they're covered in bumpy wood molding and metal grates.  It's so displeasing and uncomfortable to look at that it's almost distracting. I would much prefer to do routines with recent information, an aesthetically pleasing/relaxing atmosphere with decent music and smooth transitions. All the of the dvd's that I mentioned above were either on a beach, in a forest, or in a relaxed studio and had a great flow, filled with variety, smooth tranistion, various options for trimester and ability level, and helpful instruction.  All of them were a pleasure to do and much more helpful than this 3 disc set.  I can't speak highly enough about the Crunch dvds!

Second, while I appreciate all of the routines that specifically target the symptoms you may have (back aches, indigestion, morning sickness, etc.) and that they are broken down by trimester, every one of them is just a bunch of randomly pieced together positions.  Not only do these poses not flow from one to the next at all, they are in a random order, so it's very frustrating to follow and has you jumping all over the place with the use of like 5 or 6 different props.  It will have you come out of one pose and get perfectly seated and positioned for the next pose, and then it cuts out and comes back to a standing pose against a wall and you have to grab and place props...to finally put you back in the seated pose you were headed for in the first place.  This drives me nuts because it's the case between nearly EVERY single pose!  Usually in a practice or a routine, the series and location of poses and use of props will make sense flowing from one to the next: starting with alignment and balance, flowing into the standing poses, moving down to the floor and ending with relaxation.  In this you're up, down and all over the place the whole time....this is especially frustrating to a preggo and could cause injury!

When in these poses, there's no indication for what pose you're getting propped up in the first place, and no guidance on breathing or legnthening to help you ease into it and get the benefits from it.  It just keeps you hanging and wondering where you're headed, what the point is and how long you're going to be there.  They wait to tell you until you set up several props and get into a basic position for something that could be so simple and you can get into much more effectively on your own.  So you waste all this time moving furniture away from walls, gathering and setting up props and getting into place for something to have to start all over each time. Perfect example from when I did the Sleep Well ""pracice"" last night and it did everything but help me wind down and go to bed: It had me moving furniture and setting the stage for poses with the use of half a dozen props about 10 different times. I almost turned it off after it instructed me to move my mat up to a wall (again), grab a chair, put down two blocks or a bolster, and grab two folded blankets... and it turned out to be a simple down dog and and I had to start all over and move all of this crap out of the way.  Same situation when I wasted tons of time and energy setting up for a simple squat and then butterfly because they didn't tell me what pose I was preparing for until I ""set the stage"" with stuff I didn't need. I found myself blurting out ""are you kidding me?!"" several times, and I really missed out on that soothing accomplished feeling that usually results from yoga.  I'm going on 33 weeks pregnant and I can assure you I don't need all of this stuff for simple poses..or anything but a mat, for that matter.  You'll be just fine with a pillow/bolster, blanket and a mat in most cases, these are usually enough for yogis at any experience, pain, trimester or comfort level. It was totally unnecessary and nothing but annoying setting up half a dozen props and rearranging my living room for simple poses when I was trying to wind down for bed. Don't waste your time and energy! :(

With the myriad of experiences I've had in and out of a classroom and with home dvd's I have a hard time even calling this yoga.  This is a scrambled mess of stretches with associated yoga pose names, other than that, it's hardly yoga and it's definitely not relaxing, almost to the point of being not helpful at all.  If you're looking for a yoga practice, this is not for you!

I'll see how the prenatal pilates is, and maybe I won't mind the choppiness and unorganized thrown together poses as much because the pilates I'm used to doing is more of a collection of calisthenics, so the cutting out between poses and the constant repositioning might not seem as out of place.  I will give the third dvd a try too since I'm stuck with the set now and waiting on new dvds to arrive.  But if they're anything like the yoga dvd, there will be no rational flow from one section to the next and it will be just as frustrating, so hopefully they at least make me sweat and have routines and music from this decade!",1345680000,9,7620,5.011084718923199

My pre-pregnancy workout preference was more toward gym classes, especially cardio.  The Fit & Toned program is just that, but for pregnant women.  Good modifications are offered for the different stages.  I haven't worked a lot with the  Pilates yet, but I have done a couple routines on it and browsed though some others.

This is definitely not it.
The overall quality of  all dvd's was poor; bad selection of instructor's, settings, and pace.  The strength routine dvd was ok but slow moving with too many reps at a time.

The yoga is the easiest one in temrs of working out, the pilates the middle ground, and the last one is the ""workout,"" and each fit in nicely.

On the yoga video the three trimesters have a introduction about the trimester and the yoga.  The first addresses Morning Sickness, Headaches/Dizzy, Constipation as specific things, and also includes 4 other routines such as relaxing.  The second has Hips & Back, Bloating and a couple general.  The third follows the same idea, and includes Backache.  The ones I have done so far have been really helpful in the first into second.  Cannot comment on the third yet.  Good gentle practice overall.

The pilates are general pilates workouts and broken down by trimester.  It covers things like mat workouts, strength training, stretching and other pilates items.  Pilates is a good workout and is helpful in how controlled it is.

The last DVD has 6 workouts with three models in the 3 trimesters, a warm up, Upper & lower workout, Total body and a cool down.  It is more active than the yoga and pilates (though the pilates is a good work out.)

If you are looking for just a workout, just yoga, just pilates, then perhaps something else may be better.

I have been doing yoga and Pilates for a few years. I am not into running or cardio, just strengthening.

This is a 3-disc set which uses props and each disc is divided into sections for each trimester.

The Pilates disc is divided into 4 sections. You'll need a mat, Pilates circle, various weights and strap/band. I found the moves to be the same or very similar for each trimester. The routines did not have much variation in them.

I found the yoga disc to be the most annoying. The moves are very basic and the pace is excruciatingly slow. Try to stay awake through the whole exercise. FYI - uses many props: 4 pillows/bolsters, a wall, a chair, strap/band, and 2 blocks. This disc also includes a ""Fertility"" Routine, in case you're trying to get pregnant...huh?

The ""Fit & Toned"" disc is led by a non-pregnant, silicon implanted instructor with 2 pregnant women in the background representing different stages of pregnancy. This was the more upbeat and energetic of the 3 discs. The routines are at a moderate pace appropriate for pregnancy. I can understand how the instructor could be annoying to some people.

Also, i don't know how appropriate these videos are for pregnant women. The pilates required more abdominal work than i was comfortable with. I became very ill after a few of the workouts. One of the yoga videos that was supposed to help my stomach, had me over the toilet for three hours.",1435536000,,535,4.414141414141414
8460501,2,B0057BW6EK,"It is a very low rent looking DVD. He host of the toning and Pilates sections can't say her ""L""a instead of saying hold, it sounds like hoed. It's annoying. Plus the workouts don't particularly seem safe or tailored to pregnancy. I was doing P90X yoga and that seemed more doable than this DVD. I'll stick with the P90X yoga and walking for this pregnancy.",1431648000,,356,4.492307692307692
