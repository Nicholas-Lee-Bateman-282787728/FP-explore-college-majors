3512220,1,B001CFQO3Y,"Lots of long dialogue scenes and one stupid scene when one if the villain randomly sings for like 5 minutes are just a couple reasons why you should just rent/borrow this movie.  I feel like the whole thing was dragged out, and I don't understand how you pull that off in such a short show.
Anyway I was very dissapointed and I wish I had viewed this before I payed for it.",1227398400,2,373,4.180555555555555
3512221,5,B001CFQO3Y,"I'm so glad Hellsing IV is finally here I was so sad when all that stuff happened, but now that Hellsing IV is here I'm so happy.. =D

The Hellsing Ultimate is a must for the fans of the Hellsing manga it follows pretty closely with the storyline and I think both the English and Japanese voicing is really great the extras in the Limited edition dvds are really nice and the 200 page artbook is really nice I give this 5 out of 5 stars because Hellsing ultimate has such a good story and this volume is my favorite because it has Rip van Winkle she's one of my favorite characters in Hellsing so it was so nice seeing her and hearing how her voice sounds also seeing as how there is a Karaoke of Major's Speech I was hoping there would also be a Karaoke of Rip van Winkle singing...  Just kidding. =)

With Hellsing Ultimate IV here I can rest well knowing there'll be more of the Hellsing Ultimates comming on the way.",1224892800,2,920,4.215909090909091
3512222,5,B001CFQO3Y,"Nazi vampires preparing to invade London, bloody vampire violence, ten minute long death scenes, and a meeting with the Queen herself what more could a hellsing fan want? Vol IV gives us a taste of what's yet to come for Hellsing and to our delight the ova series has been following the manga almost perfectly. The english cast has many new editions such as Kari Wahlgren as Rip Van Winkle, Helena Taylor as Zorin Blitz and Laura Bailey as the adorable cat-boy Schrodinger plus Heinkel Wolfe who has yet to have an actual speaking role. This episode gets even more violent with a ten minute death scene for a certain someone, but with Hellsing you come to expect high octaine violence so if you have a weak stomach Hellsing might not be the best way to go. The extra features disc will keep you entertained with 2 cast interviews one with director Taliesin Jaffe and Ralph Lister the voice of Walter and Kari Wahlgren. The karaoke of the major's speech is highly entertaining especially with a group of Hellsing fans things could get crazy! Sadly it will be a long time before we see vol V of Hellsing but with the cast interviews, trailers, a Karaoke of the Major's speech, and a great fifty minute episode this will keep Hellsing fans satisfied until vol V.",1224806400,3,1259,4.6
3512223,3,B001CFQO3Y,"I love hellsing and since ultimate is closer to the original manga, i had to buy the limited editions. The first 3 volumes never caused a problem, but with this volume i had troubles playing it in vlc media player. The sound and picture was choppy, which surprised me, since all other dvd's played fine. Soon i discovered that this disk installs a copy protection rootkit on your system, so that you can't copy files from the dvd. Seems like this caused the problem with playback. As if the copy protection rootkit isn't enough, i couldn't even watch the movie. I used Anydvd, which disabled the protection during playback and this worked fine. The movie is great, but for the rootkit, i would have given it 5 stars. Now i consider not buying dvd's from this company anymore, since i don't like software being installed without my knowledge which interferes with my system. Things like that should be banned",1224201600,24,907,4.710691823899371
3512224,5,B001CFQO3Y,I loved this DVD it came with a art book and was so exciting I started repeating the lines to friends.  It was a blast.,1224028800,,119,3.76
3512225,4,B001CFQO3Y,"The animation in this volume is topnoch!!!! If you love anime, blood, and vampires this is for you!!! My only problem was the dubbing is so well done with the accents that sometimes I can't understand what the characters are saying like at the beginning with the major. A solution to this is to simply turn on the english subtitles..",1222214400,,333,4.566666666666666
3512226,5,B001CFQO3Y,"I saw the English Version and it was dubbed perfectly just like the past 3 OVA's. I have the Japanese version, the packaging was different than this U.S version, because All of the North America releases have metallic casing.
But yeah, this is worth bying its action-packed and bloody...My Fav ; )",1221955200,,297,4.730769230769231
3512227,5,B001CFQO3Y,"Our favorite vampire returns to tear through some nazi vampires, and I mean literaly tear through them. But thats the reason we love Alucard isn't it, he's viloent, merciless and has no remorse. We also get to see some new powers on display by Alucard that we haven't seen in previous episodes. All in all it was good fun, can't wait for the english, Although I do like Joji Nakata's Alucard better than Crispin Freemans. Crispin Freeman's still tight but Joji Nakata's the sickest, he's got this sinister laugh that I love. This Hellsing Ultimate series is definately one of my favorite anime series of all time, it's got bloody action and a decent story and a killer english dub. And the best part is I can watch these episodes over and over again and still be excited about them. Can't wait for volume 5.",1218326400,2,807,4.572413793103448
3512228,5,B001CFQO3Y,"Let's get one thing straight, I have not yet seen Hellsing Ultimate Vol. 4! I simply post this review to describe what viewers should expect.  If you have already read the Hellsing manga, you will know the story, period.  The Hellsing Ultimate series follows the manga to the letter with only a few minor plot cuts.

But, of course, the plot is not what the Hellsing Ultimate Series is about.  What really sells the series is the unflinching and brilliant way the studio brings Hellsing to life.  The massive splashes of blood, the flying bits of gore, the tremendous explosions, all are brought together in a glorious vision that sends a shiver down my spine.  And the voice acting for the Ultimate series is simply phenomenal, Geneon brought all the original voice actors to reprise their roles.  I can only presume that Funimation will do the same or the DVD sales will tank.

All in all, if you're a sick little puppy, you will find Hellsing Ultimate Vol. 4 to be an expression of your very soul; if you're a regular anime fan, you'll find a beautiful anime that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll.",1217980800,2,1129,4.554455445544554
3512229,5,B001CFQO3Y,"I bought this OVA a few months ago, atleast the Japanese version. As for how the english dubbing is I obviously cannot say. Despite this the rest of the quality is quite similar to the previous OVAs. The animation and score are phenominal; specifically where one of the characters does a bit of singing. I don't want to give anything specific away to those who are still in the dark. As for the story, it ends somewhere in the sixth manga. Also, for the gorehounds out there; as a fellow hound, you can trust me it is no less than any of the previous OVAs. I for one will pre-order this with rush delivery, I would recommend other Hellsing lovers to do the same.",1217635200,5,662,4.346774193548387

8287490,3,B001CFQO3Y,It's good but it's not great. I could have done without the  5-10 minute monologe at the end. That was very boring to me. I'm not really sure if I like where the series is headed. I'll have to wait and see what the rest of the series has to offer.,1411603200,,247,3.843137254901961
8287491,5,B001CFQO3Y,"The original Anime is loosely based off of the Manga. By that I mean the first couple episodes go along with the manga.  As with all things, the book is better than the anime.  However...Hellsing Ultimate comes so very near what the Manga was about, blood, story, defining of characters.  It's truly amazing how they used the visual effects to create the world you watch unfold.  The seemingly random moments of laughter, along with the dramatic build up before a fight.  When watching the bonus discs you learn how they searched far and wide to ensure the voices for each English/German character would fit the character.  It's quite amazing how much detail they have given to this series, and how well they followed the manga.  They've gone as far as to include story from the often unheard of Dawn series which is about Alucards days before the Hellsing Organization.  With this much work and detail put into one short series, I waited over a decade for the completion...and am still a fan to this day.

8287492,5,B001CFQO3Y,Cannot wait for the others to come out in packaging like this!! I have 1-4 and love the gore and animation so much more than the original anime series. VAMPIRES DO NOT SPARKLE!!,1363392000,,177,4.393939393939394
8287493,5,B001CFQO3Y,"I have been a huge fan of Hellsing for many years, so I absolutely love the Ultimate series for being such a great production that also stays true to the manga. The voicing is spot on, the animation is brilliant, and the story flows as it should. Especially with this volume, the accents are fantastic. No ridiculously crappy voice acting.

I read that people had issues getting the DVD to play. Instead of trying to run it in my PS2 I played it on my laptop instead. I used the software that came with my computer and had no problems.

I have only one complaint; however, I'm not sure what is to blame. The manga seems to drag on, over-explaining every detail and lingering on scenes involving the Nazis, Integra, and Iscariot; but this volume of the Ultimate series in particular appeared a tad bit rushed, given the amount of material it covered from the manga.

Overall, I'm pleased with the result. The gist of the story is presented without chopping vital information. Whoever cut the scenes made a good choice because there was nothing that was left out that I couldn't live without.

But that's just me, and I'll be honest -- I'm going to end up buying the remainder of the series as it's released to DVD.",1281398400,,1213,4.525114155251141
