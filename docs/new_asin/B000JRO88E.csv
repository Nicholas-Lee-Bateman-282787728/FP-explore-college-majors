8152803,3,B000JRO88E,"I purchased this a couple years ago not from Amazon but from a hockey store out in Anaheim, CA thinking I could benefit from viewing this dvd. First off the menu system was glitchy; I'd hit a button to go to a specific chapter and  it wouldn't work, it would just stay on the main menu. So I had to opt to the play all button instead and fwd through out.

Secondly, the annoying graphics & sound was too much after each and every chapter would start was just overkill. The sound was just too loud and didn't help to make me want to re-watch the chapters because of that.

Now for the meat & potatoes: It's okay... the goalie that was used for the demostrations was mediocre, a bit slow and the shots to the net looked like they were ""hand-tossed"" by the cameraman to make it look like an ""awesome"" save.. ho-hum. After about 15 or so minutes, I began to nod off by the tepid information.

For those looking for a better dvd for about the same price, I'd suggest looking up ProHybrid Training Vol 1 & 2. I don't believe Amazon carries them but you can find in through their site.",1240185600,,1078,4.2439024390243905
