6036281,5,B00FXSI9UW,"Before you heed the advice of one reviewer look at the name and judge for yourself.  Marita Lorenz was involved with DeMorchant who was connected to Oswald and the Fair Play for Cuba Committees involvement with an attempt on Castro's life in 60 and the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 62 done to ruin JFK's Presidency.  Cubans were the Burglars at Watergate.  They also pipelined cocaine from Columbia into Amerika later  Through all of this nefarious bull s***e the name Bush keeps coming up! and the Bush Dynasty are known Nazi collaborators back to WWII!  This movie raises many credible questions about who exactly and how was this ""accident"" engineered by what Walter Wink identified a long time ago as TPTB!  Look all of these names up on the www. to discover the truth about this present darkness in our National Affairs ala Kissinger, CIA, Harrimans, Rockefellers, Dulles Brothers and the Bushes!.

By the way, the democrats don't want this country governed by the people.  The democrats want to control everyone.  In their eyes, people are too stupid to take care of themselves.  Don't like this so-called documentary at all.  These narrators appear to be very Liberal - and Republican/Conservative haters.",1494460800,,416,5.2272727272727275
6036288,2,B00FXSI9UW,"Okay. I try to watch these with an open mind. I did learn some interesting things about JFK Jrs crash that wasn't widely publicized or even reported that I saw. However, I just could not figure out how this could possibly be President Bush's doing. He disappeared that day and didn't come back until Monday? Or he got financial support after losing an early primary? Or because the last screen of the video states Bush is so evil he eats babies? Or maybe that just made it easier to call him names at every opportunity?
I don't know, but apparently I am a blind, enslaved idiot because I don't accept the obvious theory that the Illuminati and the mafia and The Bushes are all Nazi's who murder people to make the club. Oh and don't forget to throw in the CIA/Mossad Ultra MK mind control currently performed in a Canadian hospital that trained the killers of everyone from John Lennon to Reagan. Bush Sr ""killed"" JFK, so it is poetically symmetrical that the son ""killed"" the son. Of course! Why didn't I think of that?
I was actually intrigued by the info presented about the crash and the obvious mishandling of the aftermath. But the vitriol the documentary maker spews, just because he can, is truly sad and destroys any possiblity of credibility he might have been able to convey in the little time he focused on anything resembling real information.",1493683200,,1356,4.630705394190872

6036325,1,B00FXSI9UW,"There are a number of inaccuracies in this conspiracy/documentary.  For example, the narrator claims that JFK Jr. had 17 years of flight experience, however JFK Jr. only received his pilots certificate in 1998 and this crash occurred in 1999, so its not possible that he had been flying that long.  Even if that were true, the ~310 hours he did have would be inconceivable over a 17 year flying career (said as a pilot) as it would mean that he would have averaged ~18 hours of flight time per year and that is not enough to truly be current.  The points made about VFR flying and talking with controllers along the route of flight is also not accurate.  I fly out of Westchester County Airport to the east end of Long Island all the time and many pilots on clear days do not talk with ATC once they are out of the bravo airspace.  Pilots who fly to Martha's Vineyard (myself included) know of the often tricky weather conditions as I am betting JFK Jr. did.  Sadly, he misjudged the situation (which could happen to any of us) and was put in a situation that he could not get out of.  This documentary is poorly done and not worth watching primarily because it is so far fetched.",1472428800,4,1180,4.410138248847926

6036327,1,B00FXSI9UW,"The question is, how many conspiracies can we tie together to get to the end result we want. The end result is to blame everything bad from the last 40 years on the Bushes and Republicans. I wasn't able to continue watching after it tried to link the 9/11 attacks to the evil military industrial complex. The major problem with any conspiracy is the number of people that are in the know directly relates to how likely it is that it will be discovered. Could there have been a conspiracy of just a few people in JFK's assassination, definitely. 9/11 would be impossible. Using conspiracy theories to support the idea of other conspiracy theories is just ridiculous.",1472169600,4,665,4.6923076923076925

6036329,1,B00FXSI9UW,"To accuse George W. Bush of this is ridiculous. There is no way.  Besides, how would it help the Bushes?

I honestly can't believe it is legal to make up such a ridiculous story and try to pass it off as fact. It is so preposterous and anyone writing positive reviews is doing so because they hate the Bush family and want to slander them, not because they actually reviewing the documentary. I love good documentaries and watch them all the time - but they lose their purpose when they blatantly make up lies to support an outlandish conspiracy theory.

6036344,3,B00FXSI9UW,"The approach the author took to the information was distracting from the information he offered. I am not a conspiracy theories proponent, but there were  very valid points raised in this documentary and it is indeed very easy to ruin a person's reputation like JFK Jr. with a few well chosen words such as a careless pilot, incompetent, etc., and it also looks like many things simply don't add up in the original crash investigation.",1470528000,3,435,4.8
6036345,5,B00FXSI9UW,"So glad this is here on Amazon prime. Great research. My only complaint is that the case against Bush 11 is very weak.  JFK jr was absolutely murdered.  And I am sure the Bush crime family was complicit.  I have actually seen this a number of times before noticing it was here today. I urge all to view and then argue the accident theory.

But truly, where was George that day? Why are they lying? Why claim to have not recovered the flight book?  Why had the back up battery to the black box been removed?  And the coincidence tying the exact same thing happening to the fuel button on the hijacked Egypt flight???  Where is the missing plane seat??  If you know the actual history of this country, you know the Bush hand in everything.  You also know they line their pockets with money from our enemies and the documented historical connection of this rich, elite, powerful group of men to Hilter is fact.

6036349,2,B00FXSI9UW,"This presentation demonstrates obvious discrepancies in  the chronology, testimony and crucial details as they first emerged on the news media, versus the way  government agencies appear to have constructed a differing narrative. The trouble occurs when the audience is supposed to take a huge leap at the summation in accepting wild claims and accusations that are immaterial to the facts of the case  of JFK Jr,'s crash. This only serves to discredit the detailed research and how facts might fit together to point to a deliberate obfuscation. The speculation at the end is essentially a grotesque cartoon that I found really offensive on principle.",1469232000,2,651,5.240384615384615
6036350,5,B00FXSI9UW,"Before 911 I would never believe a cover up of this magnitude. Now I know ""they"" can do anything they want. (Of a few names I've heard for ""them"" my favorite is Shadow Government).
If nothing else in this documentary the 15 hours it took to start the search has got to tell you something is not right. I realize a lot in this film is speculation. But I believe it to be the closest thing to the truth I'm ever going to get.
Believe it or not what I feel is far fetched is that anyone would let such a boob as George W. be directly involved.

This doc has a lot of information to digest. I appreciate the way events were presented to help me comprehend JFK jrs murder and the cover up. I also appreciate those who are trying to get information to the American people. It's really hard

6036351,5,B00FXSI9UW,"Another blockbuster of a coverup film of the corrupt acts performed by our government trying to hide their murder of JFK Jr. There was a flight instructor aboard JFK Jr's plane, thus the purposeful delay of 15 hours locating  JFK Jr's plane so the government could remove the flight instructor's body. The fact that the entire seat he was sitting on was not found in the wreckage speaks for itself. JFK Jr. never flew his plane without a flight instructor aboard. The delay in the taking off of the plane by JFK Jr., was due to the flight instructor being late...This film tries to prove that the flight instructor was a victim of MK Ultra's mind control. He was programed to shut off the fuel control switch on JFK Jr's  plane thus sending the plane straight down into the sea.....The one fact left out of this film was the fact that JFK Jr's chauffeur was an Israeli Mosad agent who might have had orders to plant a bomb on JFK Jr's plane because of the article in JFK Jr's magazine: ""By George,"" that tried to prove that Issac Rubin was murdered by Sharon Perez.....",1468886400,,1069,4.505154639175258

Ted Kennedy had to contact President Clinton in order to accomplish a proper investigation and recover the bodies.  Maybe John Jr did suffer some bizarre pilot malady but that does not explain and/or give credence to the complete situation or rule out foul play.

Turning off the fuel selector valve will cut fuel off to the plane.  According to the documentary, this can not take place by accident as there is a safety feature that makes this a two-handed operation. Why would anyone in the plane cut fuel to the engine?  Why would the Pentagon take over the search from the Coast Guard?

  JFK jr. was actually a great pilot despite the lies about the ''Kennedy curse'' , the only curse is bad people keep killing them and good people suck on the lies.",1402444800,5,240,4.511627906976744
6036455,1,B00FXSI9UW,"I give this a one because the documentary starts out okay-then becomes so biased for the Kennedys and dwells in conspiracy theories that even Alex Jones wouldn't believe. It lost all credibility in it's worship of every Kennedy that ever lived. To be clear, I think JFK was a phenomenal president and was killed because he wanted to dismantle the military industrial complex, but he and his brothers are not saints. That is the way this documentary tries to make them out. It doesn't mention how like the Bush's and others, the Kennedys also have built their wealth through oil investments in offshore tax exempt accounts. It also makes some claims without backing them with evidence, such as claiming Ted Kennedy was drugged when he ran his car off the bridge resulting in the death of Mary Joe Kopechne and then quickly moving to another talking point unrelated.

They could be right about what happened to JFK jr., but the obvious bias of such a questionable family of politicians is suspect. Maybe without such praise of the kennedys it could have been more believable.",1402272000,7,1073,4.831521739130435
6036456,1,B00FXSI9UW,"While there are indeed some viable facts involved in this ""film,"" this production is a poor excuse for a documentary. The details this production cites are all from tabloids or other such frivolous media. Further, there are gaping holes in lines of logic. Additionally, the narrator seems irate -- as depicted in the crude ""animation,"" -- which clouds his credibility for any thoughtful audience member who's fluent in conspiracy-based documentaries. Sadly, these amateur mistakes cloud the real and alarming facts interspersed throughout. Whether you watch this isn't up to me, but if you do, please watch at least 2 other documentaries on the topic by viable journalists.",1402272000,25,673,5.299065420560748

6036460,1,B00FXSI9UW,"I watched this out of pure curiosity about JFK, Jr.  The absurdity of the 'film' is breathtaking.  George Bush, Sr. had JFK murdered and GW had JFK, Jr. murdered.  One of the questions he feels to be important is how Bush, Jr., a drug addled alcoholic (according to him) could POSSIBLY have won an election against upright war hero John McCain?  Gee, I don't know.  How did Obama beat the war hero?  I don't want to dignify this by a further critique.

8619282,3,B00FXSI9UW,"This is a technically, poorly produced documentary, that shows the conspiracies of how the Bushes killed the Kennedys, father killed father, son and killed son... and how Bush pushed the button for 911. I am not sure if this is supposed to be comical, based on the way it was presented, and the lack of education displayed in the dialog, (many uses of words like retarted and stupid), or if it was a serious individual that really believes everything, as facts but has a lack of education, as well as little to no background in English, Grammar, or Speech Writing. I can picture stoned, college aged viewers, really enjoying this. The producers use of a cartoon devil and letting us all know that people like the Bushes, Ford, etc., were Nazis, is something that has not been shown in other JFK Jr documentaries that I have viewed.",1529280000,,831,4.659863945578231
8619283,2,B00FXSI9UW,"While I am a believer in the facts that both JFK and Jr were both assassinated, the narrator's and/or the writers obvious politically one sided slights overshadowed the facts.
To make idiot statements such as ""Bush ruled while Reagan napped for 8 years"" is way out of bounds and completely inaccurate. Bush senior couldn't win an election on his own and couldn't lead on his own. Which is why he lost reelection after Reagan set him up! Reagan was the best President since JFK and this is from a Republican who knows that JFKs policies and forward thinking were a unique and awesome blend of both conservative and liberal thinking.
This would have been a better program if the writers would have just stuck to the point.",1528070400,2,720,4.677165354330708

8619285,1,B00FXSI9UW,"Entertaining, but almost entirely based on logical fallacies and contradictions. This is a fantasy trip down the mind of a left wing conspiracy theorists belief system. It is worth watching to view the authors exercise in propaganda, hasty generalizations, and acts of connecting guilt to wealth and ideology, wholesale. While idolizing and overlooking the tremendous wealth and connections of Joe Kennedy (the father of JFK and Bobby), who was in favor of appeasing Hitler and got flack for it from England, All the while the author claims that all the indrustrialists and Republicans were in control of Hitler. I think the Kennedis were good, but flawed, The Bushes were good but flawed. However, you won't find any people who have qualities of both good and evil here, only those who are either evil or good wholesale.",1518998400,,821,5.044117647058823

I have a friend with bvFTD - behavioral variant Frontal Temporal Dementia - and she would love this due to the paranoia that is one of the hallmarks of her disease.
