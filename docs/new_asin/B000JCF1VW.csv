But wait what is this still in bead? Yep it is eight year-old Kevin (Macaulay Culkin.) Now after realizing he is alone the fact that it could be fun sinks in. The only thing he has to watch out for is the mysterious neighbor (Roberts Blossom) that seems to be eyeing him. Yeah right. The fun thing about Christmas is it attracts wet bandits (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern.)

Now the contest begins between the bandits (in Wile E. Coyote style) are wanting in the house and Kevin (in the Road Runner style) holding them off.

Who will win and will his mother find a unique way to return in time?",1498780800,,735,4.389705882352941
