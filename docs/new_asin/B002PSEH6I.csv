8377289,5,B002PSEH6I,"Four dvds, 426 ninutes, it's a real study.  Dvd #4 has 96 minutes of extras.  The movie is 33o minutes long.

Acting is very good.  Cinematography is very good,  It is 54 years old but the transfer is good.

I have 4 players but the blu-ray player locked up now and then.  My other players worked fine.",1334707200,2,302,4.192982456140351
