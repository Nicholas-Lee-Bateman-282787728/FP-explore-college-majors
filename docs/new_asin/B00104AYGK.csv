3045934,5,B00104AYGK,"Well, I seem to have developed a taste for Asian ""art house"" type movies, especially martial arts epics with great choreographed fight sequences, vivid colors, interesting storylines.

I've previously seen and enjoyed such fare as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crouching-Tiger-Hidden-Dragon/dp/B00003CXR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Curse-of-the-Golden-Flower/dp/B000MRA592/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Curse of the Golden Flower</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Forbidden-Kingdom/dp/B0013FZUQK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Forbidden Kingdom</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hero/dp/B00030590I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hero</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Flying-Daggers/dp/B0007Q6VXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of Flying Daggers</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Monkey/dp/B00005V1Y2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Monkey</a>. Each of them has its strengths and weaknesses.

Getting back to Legend of the Black Scorpion, from my understanding, it's a Chinese martial arts retelling of Shakespeare's play Hamlet. While I don't think I've seen or read Hamlet, I don't think it's essential to have previously read it or seen it to understand what's going on here.

Similar in theme to Curse of the Golden Flower, Legend of the Black Scorpion is a martial arts / drama piece about Chinese dynastic royalty and empire. Though it mainly focuses on the family / political dynamics of the royal court, with various plots to seize power, etc.

A number of the fight scenes have an almost ballet-like quality about them. They're often more like a well-choreographed dance than a battle per se. It makes sense, insofar as there is also a sub-plot about the crown prince taking up the arts of Chinese song and dance.

Now, one thing that I noted was the overemphasis on blood in this film. it spurts, it gushes, it drips everywhere. There seems to be a special focus on showing the blood itself, sometimes in slow motion. I thought it was excessive, and I'm not sure why so much attention was paid to emphasizing blood and bloodiness in this film.

The blood issue was minor to me, as I'm more-or-less desensitized to it at this point. Overall, I really liked this movie though (outside of the blood and brutality of some scenes). I thought the sets and costuming were colorful and first rate. The choreography was great. Etc. I think it makes a good addition to the other ""art house"" type movies listed above.

I'd certainly take this movie over&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Butterfly-Sword/dp/B00022PZJC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Butterfly Sword</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warriors-of-Heaven-and-Earth/dp/B000683VH0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warriors of Heaven and Earth</a>&nbsp;(neither of which I particularly cared for, despite decent reviews on Amazon and/or DVD Empire).

Addendum (8-12-08): Apparently this film was originally titled ""The Banquet."" So, if you've seen that one, this is the same movie from what I understand.

Again, rather bloody at times, but otherwise pretty gorgeous cinematography. Right up there with some of the other good ""art house"" cinema.",1217721600,3,3511,7.320665083135392
3045935,5,B00104AYGK,"I have gotten slightly addicted to asian films since watching the AZN Channel (which, sadly, is no more) so I picked up some films from Amazon. This was one of them and I was very impressed by it. Visually it's stunning, the sub-titles are easy to follow. I highly recommend it.",1207526400,2,278,4.470588235294118
3045936,4,B00104AYGK,"How this film missed the American theater circuits is inexplicable!  One of the most visually sumptuous portrayals of court life and intrigue since Bertolucci's The Last Emperor, and on par, if not surpassing, the historical martial arts epics of Yimou Zhang. This is a must for anyone that enjoys or appreciates this genre of Chinese cinema, and is the best cinematic adaptation of Hamlet that I can recall.  It also is accompanied by an excellent critical commentary (which may aid those who find the film ""cold"" or the ending incomprehensible).",1207353600,31,547,5.066666666666666
3045937,3,B00104AYGK,"The Legend of Black Scorpion is a phenomenal blend of scenery and style as the director uses operatic appeal in the form of the metaphorical phantom to stylize the sequential and breath-taking coreographic kung fu, especially as exemplified in the hide-away forests where the endangered and practically deposed crown-prince drowns in his sorrow, overwhelmed by the injustice of his uncle, the murderous usurper of the throne.
While this is the most fantastic scene, the flow is maintained to a great degree throughout the film. HOWEVER, a great disappointment like many previous kung fu movies, for example, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Jet Li's ""Hero"" and House of Flying Daggers, and not to mention Curse of the Golden Flower. Somehow, Shakespearean endings do not suit these martial arts. Eastern Philosophy is characterized by some forms of exquisite closure and transcendence, and these movies have none. Moreover, the kung fu was not enough. The movie gave a blast of unparalleled kung fu in the fighting scene at the prince's hide-away and from there took a down-hill turn into just drama. We watch these because we love to see a man being ""kung-fu-ed"" to death, not to see a woman killed by a sword or knife protruding from nowhere and no one. These directors need to snap out of the Shakespeareanism, be true to Eastern tradition in martial arts and give us closure and stop with the romance. SOMEHOW, romance always absolutely spoils a martial arts film. There are no really great martial arts films being produced today and the lack of closure without a sequel is incomplete artistry that detracts of satisfaction.
Legend of Black Scorpion has good scenery, costumes, and initial choreography, but faded into a drama with a disappointing ending.",1207094400,2,1758,5.086505190311419
3045938,5,B00104AYGK,"I was irked that this retitled reissue of THE BANQUET wasn't identified
as such. Obviously, I had THE BANQUET already. But this reissue has a radically superior print and audio and very, very well-done subtitles.

It's really an Asian retelling of Hamlet. But an adaptation so slick and well-done,  it's like a whole new story. The concept of combining dance with swordplay with an extraordinary musical track really comes across  with this improved version.

The second disk of added features doesn't add much,
just the usual self-back-patting face-on spiels.
And humorously, so deadly serious.

The less-than heavy characterizations comment of other reviewers noted is true. But the graphics alone are worth the trip. Costumes, scenery and set designs are magnificent.

( But I still think that Amazing Amazon should PROMINENTLY
note that such repackaged/retitled films are not re-make's...)",1206748800,7,893,5.434782608695652
3045939,3,B00104AYGK,"The costumes are beautiful. The fighting scenes are artistic and attractive. The acting of the main female actor is convincing. However the plot and ending are confusing. The ending does not make sense.

3045940,3,B00104AYGK,"My husband ordered this DVD so I had no expectations on quality or any knowledge of the story.  It didn't take me long to figure out it was based on Shakespeare's ""Hamlet.""  Unfortunately, it didn't do justice to that classic, tragic story.

This film is a good example of what has almost become a genre - films that attempt to duplicate the success of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""  We've bought and seen ""Hero,"" ""House of Flying Daggers,"" and ""Curse of the Golden Flower.""  They all have the near-flying martial arts, expertly choreographed fights and gorgeous costumes.  We enjoyed them all, but where these films fall short, including Black Scorpion, is the stories lack the magic of CTHD.  That tale of unattainable love, wrapped in a mystery was original, with superb acting and a new take on action.  This one would have been better served to follow Hamlet more closely as the changes they made did NOT improve the story.  They slowed the movie down, or caused confusion.  And the movie was very slowly paced to begin with.

The story is focused on the empress' point of view, rather than the prince as in Hamlet.  That works just fine, as Ziyi Zhang is captivating in the role.  She gives life to what could have been an awful movie rather than just a disappointing one.  The old emperor dies from a Scorpion bite and his brother usurps the throne from the prince and steals the empress, who had already been stolen from the crown prince by the last emperor.  Familiar characters appear, from Polonius, to Ophelia (who is the best represented character in the film) to Laertes and the royal family.  We have the mousetrap play, wherein the prince does indeed catch the conscience of a king and the kill all the lawyers ending.  Except, the ending has a distracting and confusing change that leaves the viewer hanging - literally.  I won't spoil it, but one of the main characters dies after the climactic confrontation, but who does the deed is never revealed and is all the more confusing since everybody who is anybody has already died or been exiled!

As to this edition, the DVD does have a dubbed track available and is very well done.  After 15 minutes, I forgot it was being dubbed.  Though it is a two disc edition, there is nothing spectacular in the extras.  The making of featurette is perhaps the most interesting, but there are also two translated interviews and a behind the scenes bit.  There is no extra footage, or featurettes on costumes, or better yet a piece on the historical time period.

Overall, if you enjoyed the other films you'll enjoy this one though likely not as much.  If you've never read Hamlet, you'll like it even more. I recommend the single disc edition over paying so much for 2 discs, but some viewers will enjoy the extras.  Cautiously recommended.",1205280000,20,2801,4.700205338809035
3045941,5,B00104AYGK,"The Good Things:
*Actions scenes are pretty darn awesome.  They are well-choreographed, have lots of slow-motion, and are quite bloody.  Some of it even looks beautiful.
*Filming style is good.  It has plenty of good camera angles, and has a lot of vivid imagery.
*Sets and costumes are very imaginatively designed.
*Music is interesting.
*Acting is good; characters are interesting, and it is easy to see how they correspond to Shakesphere's ""Hamlet,"" from which the story is derrived.
*Even though this is an adaptation of ""Hamlet,"" it is a very different and liberal one.  The story and characters stands well on its own.

The Bad Things:
*A little slow at parts.

As with other great modern martial arts films (like ""Hero,"" or ""Shinobi""), this one has a very lavish, mesmerizing style and lots of impressive fight scenes.  It is not quite Shakesphere, but it is definately artful martial arts.  Even the bloody scenes are done with style; Stanley Kubrick would have been jealous.  I would definately reccomend this to anybody who likes martial arts.",1204761600,8,1053,5.005747126436781
3045942,5,B00104AYGK,"I would have passed this up, but I ended watching it several times.  I always grumbled to go to Shakespeare when I was little, but afterwards I always ended up throughly satisfied that such art could be produced and enjoyed.  It is a variation on a theme but at the same time nothing seems out of place.  China shows us its middle earth can be a pure setting for any well formed story.  I can't say how historically accurate it was, and so perhaps some doubt there takes away from it being perfect, but this was cerainly of the most memorable art.  I would hope it comes out in a higher definition format.",1204675200,,605,4.31858407079646
3045943,4,B00104AYGK,"LEGEND OF THE BLACK SCORPION (a.k.a. The BANQUET) is the Chinese rendition of Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"". Directed by Mainland China's own acclaimed director Feng Xiaogang, joined with the lush cinematography by Tim Yip (Croaching Tiger Hidden Dragon) and the action choreography by Yuen Woo-Ping( Fearless); the film is set to bring Chinese Wuxia epic to new heights. Feng even acquired the services of one of China's most renowned international actresses; Zhang Ziyi.
The film was released in Asia in 2006( before ""Curse of the Golden Flower""), set for the American market but for reasons unknown, ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" was marketed instead to U.S. shores.

Synopsis loosely derived from Media Asia DVD back cover:
The story is set in ancient China during the period of Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms. Against this backdrop of internal turmoil and external threat poised by the neighboring Khitan Empires, lives Empress Wan (Zhang Ziyi). As beautiful as she is limber, she harbors forbidden desires for her stepson Crown Prince Wu Luan (Daniel Wu). When the Emperor dies of reasons undetermined and his younger brother Li takes the throne, Wan marries Li to protect Wu Luan and seal her own position in the ruling body. But Li is not a fool and dispatches assassins that ultimately fail to kill Wu Luan. When Emperor Li proclaims a big banquet, Wu Luan and Wan realize it is time to strike.

The Banquet (I prefer to call it by its original title) is a beautiful film; elaborate costumes and set designs are the main draw of the film. Frankly, I liked this film's cinematography, atmosphere and set designs more than ""Curse of the Golden Flower"". The film simply looks astounding, the colors and way it is shot is truly amazing. However, beauty and cinematography can only carry a film so far. The expectations for ""The Banquet"" are extremely high, and while it does succeed as a high-quality spectacle that is a visual and aural feast; it fails to deliver on emotions and its characters. Even Yuen Woo-Ping's action direction feels a little hampered with the overused slow-motion approach undertaken by the director. Still, the film is better than most. It presents itself similar to a stage play (which is fine, it is ""Hamlet"") but I believe this style does hurt the film a little. The film is carefully and superbly arranged with characters well-mannered that even assassins conduct themselves politely even in the face of blood. The Banquet is more a period drama than a Wuxia film, in fact, I believe the film could have survived without any martial arts action.

Amazingly beautiful Zhang Ziyi struggles to carry the film. As good and beautiful the actress is, even Zhang cannot carry a film all by herself. Her portrayal of Empress Wan is actually the film's center; Zhang's character is in the middle of deception, lust and eventual betrayal. Thankfully, Zhang has the charisma to pull off an underdeveloped character such as Empress Wan. However, Zhang feels a bit unseasoned and too young (perhaps) for the role of the empress. Don't get me wrong, I think Zhang Ziyi is an awesome actress, but the role feels tailor-made for Chinese veteran actress Gong Li. Daniel Wu plays Wu Luan; a brooding, quiet and never shows his emotions in calculating vengeance. Wu plays an acceptable performance, after all, he does play ""Hamlet"" which was meant as a person with minor momentum, instead of displaying raw anger he imposes his wrath through indirect means. I guess it was a good move for the screenplay to emphasize Empress Wan's character than Wu Luan himself, I doubt Daniel Wu will be able to carry the film at all.

The performances are good for the most part. It's just that the characters seemed a bit underdeveloped that the lead characters will have some difficulty connecting with its audience. The film does take off strongly but it couldn't stay aloft. Supporting actress Zhao Xun (Ming Ming) has huge talent but her character of Quing is too simple and a bit one-dimensional. Ge You comes out with an outstanding performance as Emperor Li; his powerful portrayal is truly superb and note-worthy. Ultimately, while this film is loosely based on ""Hamlet"", the climax does occur in a banquet and this is a Chinese film where the old adage applies: No evil deed will go unpunished and repaid.

The Banquet is a very difficult film to judge. The film feels too mainstream for a Wuxia Epic drama and it seems geared towards international audiences and not to the people of Feng's native land. The film is definitely a part of the superficial, overindulgent popular Chinese film for viewers in the U.S. It is not a contemporary Wuxia film but rather one so polished for international acclaim (then again, I've read it was its intention). The lack of emotions and character depth never allows the film to surpass its gorgeous costumes and set designs. The film does succeed in the classic manipulations and plots of betrayal; but ultimately, the lasting impression is how beautifully shot and expensive the film is that it falls a bit short of epic grandeur. The film is better than most, it is better than Chen Kaige's ""The Promise"" but if you saw ""HERO"" and "" HOUSE of FLYING DAGGERS""; the film just cannot surpass the coldness of its exterior.

RECOMMENDED [3  stars]

Note: The Dragon Dynasty release (re-titled Legend of the Black Scorpion) will carry an English dubbed track.",1200096000,68,5395,4.894967177242888

3045945,5,B00104AYGK,"A marvelous expression / Interpretation of Hamlet within the culture of China - concerned with the ideological aspect of Shakespeare and not a word for word translation. Artfully scripted by  Gangjian Qiu and directed by Feng Xiaogang (look these guys up if you don't know their work. They put out many worthy works) the movie is a beautiful wedding of Greek, English and Chinese elements. Staged in a theatrical style the presentation is executed at once in a limited view (the stage) and expansive as the stage often explodes in action with players floating around and one time they enter the scene floating on bamboo tree tops as seen in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. They also display three dimensional movement by floating in and out of view and fighting / flying to the various levels of a multidimensional structure built on a beautiful set. The incorporation of Greek flavor is accommodated by Greek style mask worn by the players in some beautifully executed performance. Their contribution to the films artistry and imaginative makeup is wonderful. The acrobatics performance of the wushu players is done with a visual grace and refinement throughout that should please any fan of wushu theater.

The director displays remarkable restraint in maintaining an even, steady purposeful pace throughout the production. I've read that some consider the pace slow at times! I sometimes found the films pace a challenge to my will and my ability to hold my emotions in check so I did not race ahead of the presentation. This excertion of self control created a level of suspense and tension between the film and myself that I very much appreciated as it forced me to match the pace of my emotions with what I saw unfolding before me. A wonderful experience as I was able to see and appreciate the refinement of the players brilliance. Every moment is well done and should be appreciated for the quality on display throughout. For example; I enjoyed the performance of the masked players as so well done I found myself completely drawn into their visually artistic and, I thought, ingenious performances.

Singing is an important component in the Chinese traditional theater. The singing in this interpretation is wonderful. Teeg Geer has a vocal ability capable of summoning the spiritual expression of any soul listening to his wonderful interpretation of the play. Of course, this is Shakespeare, and lust and ambition drive several characters to the conclusion which is a who done it killing. You will be well rewarded for the scant price of this blue ray. You may even find yourself watching it several times finding new gems with each viewing, ENJOY",1496793600,2,2658,4.981981981981982

3045988,4,B00104AYGK,"I liked this highly original 2006 Chinese adaptation of ""Hamlet"", even if it has some flaws. I spend a rather pleasant moment watching it. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

China, X century, the end of the Tang Dynasty. The Crown Prince, Wu Luan (Daniel Wu) and one of ladies of the imperial court, Little Wan (Zhang Ziyi) are in love - but the Emperor, after seeing Little Wan, takes her as his Empress and orders Wu Luan to marry another woman, lady Qing Nu (Zhou Xun). Wu Luan, deeply hurt, refuses and goes in voluntary exile in the province to devote himself to study music and dance - his extravagant behaviour makes that some people believe that he went insane with grief. Soon after, the Emperor is murdered - many believe that the killer was his brother Li (Ge You), who became the new Emperor. The new Emperor retains Little Wan as his Empress and recalls the Crown Prince from the exile. Soon factions form in the court, one supporting the new Emperor, the other the Crown Prince who is expected to seek revenge for the murder of his father. His return is especially expected by Lady Qing Nu, who, albeit not wanted by Wu Luan, is very much in love with him... And then the film really begins...

From the first minutes of the film it is obvious, that this is NOT exactly the story of ""Hamlet"", as there are important modifications. Hamlet's mother was replaced by a younger woman, whom he was in love with. The stealing of the bride of the Crown Prince by his older father is in fact an echo of one such very famous incident in Chinese history, when in 738 emperor Xuanzong took from one of his sons his young wife, the archi-famous Yang Guifei. The relationship between Wu Luan and Qing Nu is somehow different than the one between Hamlet and Ophelia. Wu Luan is somehow more assertive and less hesitating than Hamlet. Many elements are added, like court intrigues, fights, escapes and elaborate assassination attempts. Last but not least, the final fate of Wu Luan's evil uncle, Emperor Li, is very different from the one in ""Hamlet"" - and honestly, that was actually for me the weakest thing in the whole film. On another hand, the ending is in its general lines very Shakespearian...

It seems unavoidable that idiotic kung fu and other surrealistic fights must be introduced in almost every Chinese production - in this film martial arts are present, but thanks God not as much as I feared... Visually this film is splendid, actors play very well and Zhang Ziyi is incredibly beautiful.

In Europe this film was released under the much more appropriate title ""The banquet"" - the title adopted for USA is really not very good, as it suggests some kind of martial arts B movie. Which is definitely not the case...

Although not really a masterpiece, this is a good, original, very entertaining film. I am very glad that I bought and watched it and I think I will keep the DVD for another viewing. ENJOY!",1446508800,2,2944,4.6106870229007635

3046039,5,B00104AYGK,"Just finished watching LOTBS today and I must admit that this is now one of my favorites. I have always been a fan of asian cinema because of it's penchant for delivering authentic period depictions of samurai, geisha and the ruling class and their way of life. BTW, I own the bluray versions of Ran, Sansho the Bailiff, Kagemusha, Kuroneko, Rashomon and Yojimbo as well as dvd's of Chushingura, Kwaidan, Onibaba, Goyokin, Throne of Blood and Flowers of Shanghai so I'm not just a casual fan. While some of these films are considered timeless classics of world cinema, still others have been ignored and dismissed. Crouching Tiger made martials arts movies popular again and it truly is an amazing film yet it does not have a monopoly on terrific story telling, sumptuous visuals and operatic combat. While Tiger is the more kinetic and exhilarating of the two movies, I feel that Black Scorpion pacts the greater dramatic impact. While some may consider the slow pacing and long takes to be a tad dull or boring, that is merely the reaction of the uninitiated. All of the movies I named earlier also feature measured pacing and some formal ceremonies or traditions that may lose those viewers who can't appreciate their authenticity. This movie boasts stunning cinematography, sharp dialogue and outstanding period detail. The casting is dead on and the acting is first rate. This is a must see!",1375833600,,1396,4.894514767932489

3046041,2,B00104AYGK,"Legend of the Black Scorpion is a disappointment given the who's who involved and the story. From director Feng Xiaogang to actors Ge You and Zhang Ziyi, it is loaded with talent, but it comes across as little more than beautiful but empty.

For starters, the movie drags. Slightly over two hours seemed much longer as the story crawls along to the inevitable (to anyone familiar with Hamlet) conclusion. It is a dialogue and scenery driven film and the dialogue is simply not up to Shakespeare even if the gorgeous scenery and plentitude of colors gives one much to admire.

Ge You does as well as he can, but his role is a lot of slow line delivery and dramatic pauses. Also, he makes his character perhaps a bit too sympathetic, despite the manner in which he came into power. On the other hand, Zhang Ziyi seems miscast as the empress dowager, plodding along with whispered treachery and her trademark devilish smile, but all the while seeming far too young. Zhou Xun is fairly wasted in an underdeveloped role as a pining lover, and Daniel Wu plays the Hamlet-ish role with an unfortunately cool demeanor.

In the end, The Legend of the Black Scorpion (aka The Banquet) seems to have fallen short of its own lofty goals. Given how many other fantastic films there are from China, you can pass on this and try some of the others. From this director, I recommend If You Are The One (also starring Ge You), or two other choices would be The Road Home with Zhang or To Live (with Gong Li), both directed by Zhang Yimou.",1369612800,,1520,4.54014598540146

3046046,5,B00104AYGK,"Originally titled ""The Banquet"" (English translation), Legend proves that Chinese movie making is finally in the big league with Hollywood.  The photography is artful and exquisite.  The acting renders the ""inscrutability"" of stereotypical Chinese at once both nuanced and comprehensible to this westerner, although I'll admit that it took me a while to fully understand some of the motivations after struggling with the subtitles.  Perhaps most impressive are the sets which fairly well evoke the grandeur of the imperial court.

The additional features are worth watching later, as they show the issues which confront Chinese movie makers and actors are very much the same as for their western counterparts.  Perhaps the most concise appraisal of the movie is that it isn't so much a martial arts film, as much as it is an art film with (superbly choreographed) fight scenes.  Me thinks Shakespeare would have been proud (of the plot.)",1354752000,,937,5.213333333333333

I would have cast different actors in one or two roles (the Emperor certainly and the Prince perhaps), but good grief! The sets! The costumes! In the opening scene, the Prince is in seclusion in a monastery the likes of which I've never seen before. I kept my disk from Netflix for 2 weeks because I couldn't stop watching this film. I finally had to order my own.
It is a very stylized work, full of formality, and much of the time, the visuals and the musical score just hit a sweet spot that makes everything about it seem very lush. As it is, you'll swear they filmed it in front of a live orchestra.  If the acting was a tad better, it would rank right up there with House of Flying Daggers and Hero (excepting Jet Li's wooden performance). As it is, it surpasses Curse of the Golden Flower, which ultimately portrayed the palace as a landscape of restricted spaces.

Yes, it does move at a leisurely pace, but as every frame of this film is such a beautiful tapestry to view, the pace is perfect. Be warned, the bloodletting and the acts of violence are filmed as lovingly as the dance movements that are part of the storyline. While it is much more graphic than some, it is not gratuitous.

I liked the storyline, and the clear parallels to Hamlet, yet this is a storyline in its own right. I found the characters beautifully drawn and superbly acted. The sets, the costumes, the attention to details throughout the production... all are simply stunning.

If you like films of this type, add this to your collection. You will be glad you did.

The balance of the film was totally disappointing.  Spoiler alert!  By the end of the film every major character is dead.  But so what, as with perhaps a single exception we have not developed any real feeling for any of them.

Plot lines are frequently introduced with no reason and often disposed of without effect.  As mentioned, the characters are presented without any true development or depth.  We have little or no appreciation for their motivation except by what is more often implied than stated.  The pace of the film is ponderous, more like a cross-country trek across the frozen Russian wilderness.  The martial arts sequences are just too often silly.  No degree of suspense of disbelief will succeed in making the conflicts acceptable.  The wire work, while perhaps novel and interesting in its first or second usage, is tedious and again, silly.  It truly makes one wonder why the actors employed horses so often in the film when they might have more efficiently just levitated from point to point.

3046055,5,B00104AYGK,"I should probably preface this review by saying that my movie collection is primarily dominated with Asian cinema and with that being said there is not a better blending of east and west than Legend Of The Black Scorpion. For all of you who were never in High School, Hamlet is the classic Shakespearean story about betrayal and revenge and this movie brings a brand new flavor to the story all together. The style is your neo classical Chinese setting per movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and the martial arts are actually used rather sparingly but what martial arts are actually featured are very refreshing and don't rely too heavily on wires. This is one of the few movies I have seen that really doesn't betray the central themes and plot of Hamlet but at the same time really make the story it's own entity. It takes so many of the main characters and really develops them in different ways but you always get the feelings they are supposed to evoke as characters in the Shakespearean story. So really what this movie lacks in following in the play it more than makes up for in the way it conveys the themes of the play. As some other reviews have said this movie is definitely geared more towards the Asian audience, dealing with some heavy themes that most western audiences aren't quite as used to and features quite a bit of the typical Chinese story archetypes but at the same time they seem to work well off of each other and work in perfect harmony.",1320278400,,1472,4.558490566037736

3046061,4,B00104AYGK,"LEGEND OF THE BLACK SCORPION

I have always been a fan of Asian cinema ever since I was born obviously as any one who has read my stuff before will tell you. As I have collected film after film and anime after anime [I hunt down the live action while my girl hunts down all anime] I'd like to think I have a pretty good collection. That is why when the Weinstein Brothers created the Dragon Dynasty company to introduce more of these films to an American audience. Here we have the very beautiful ""Legend of the Black Scorpion"" or ""The Banquet"" in its entire glorious splendor, it really is a wonderfully shot film.

This film is a take on Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" and tries to tell that story in a new way, on some levels it works and on others it fails. Directed by Xiaogang Feng this film is very amazing as far as style and cinematography but the storytelling lacks a little, underdeveloped characters hamper the film a bit. Still there is a lot good with this film and is worthy of your time but be prepared as it does move a bit slow. But it is based on a really well known and famous play so it has elements that will be appealing to the average viewer.

Empress Wan (Ziyi Zhang) has lost her husband and is now being put into a relationship with her brother in law Emperor Li (You Ge) as he wants the power of the kingdom. The thing is she has a thing for her step son Prince Wu Luan (Daniel Wu), and this is not lost on Emperor Li. He hires some assassins to kill the prince so that there will be no competition to the throne. But they fail to do so and the prince makes his way back to the kingdom. Upon arriving it is announced by the Emperor that there will be a banquet and it is in this a plan is devised to end the Emperor.

The film starts very strong and is at its most enjoyable throughout the first half of the film, but it starts to lack and can't keep the pace going. Also like I said before the film is beautiful and just amazingly shot, to be honest it really is a spectacle for the eyes more often than not. The astonishing and breathtaking cinematography mixed with wonderful scenery and sets make this a wonder to the retina. Add in the wonderful atmosphere and great slow motion fight scenes this is a good film.

But that does not mean it is a perfect movie, in fact one of its positives is also a negative. The slow motion fight sequences tend to be over used a bit here, it is better than it is bad but it is still an issue. Still the biggest flaw of the film is the lack of character development, for such a beautiful film there is a lack of emotion from the characters that can not be over looked. Ziyi Zhang does a good job here as does everyone really but the script did not add enough depth to the characters. To be honest this really did have a good chance at being a classic, any film that has Yuen Woo-Ping, Tim Yip, Li Zhang, and Xiaogang Feng behind the scenes had that potential.

The film does not reach that classic status but is very much worth a look if you have never seen it. The original release of course is great but for any American fan that may be interested may want to pick up the Dragon Dynasty release. It is comes with some great special features in a 2 disc collection including a great commentary track with Bey Logan. Of course the behind the scenes and all that stuff is featured as well, so I do recommend getting this film.",1284681600,,3384,4.1984615384615385
3046062,5,B00104AYGK,"LEGEND OF THE BLACK SCORPION (a.k.a. The BANQUET) is the Chinese rendition of Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"". Directed by Mainland China's own acclaimed director Feng Xiaogang, joined with the lush cinematography by Tim Yip (Croaching Tiger Hidden Dragon) and the action choreography by Yuen Woo-Ping( Fearless); the film is set to bring Chinese Wuxia epic to new heights. Feng even acquired the services of one of China's most renowned international actresses; Zhang Ziyi.
The film was released in Asia in 2006( before ""Curse of the Golden Flower""), set for the American market but for reasons unknown, ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" was marketed instead to U.S. shores.

Synopsis loosely derived from Media Asia DVD back cover:
The story is set in ancient China during the period of Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms. Against this backdrop of internal turmoil and external threat poised by the neighboring Khitan Empires, lives Empress Wan (Zhang Ziyi). As beautiful as she is limber, she harbors forbidden desires for her stepson Crown Prince Wu Luan (Daniel Wu). When the Emperor dies of reasons undetermined and his younger brother Li takes the throne, Wan marries Li to protect Wu Luan and seal her own position in the ruling body. But Li is not a fool and dispatches assassins that ultimately fail to kill Wu Luan. When Emperor Li proclaims a big banquet, Wu Luan and Wan realize it is time to strike.

The Banquet (I prefer to call it by its original title) is a beautiful film; elaborate costumes and set designs are the main draw of the film. Frankly, I liked this film's cinematography, atmosphere and set designs more than ""Curse of the Golden Flower"". The film simply looks astounding, the colors and way it is shot is truly amazing. However, beauty and cinematography can only carry a film so far. The expectations for ""The Banquet"" are extremely high, and while it does succeed as a high-quality spectacle that is a visual and aural feast; it fails to deliver on emotions and its characters. Even Yuen Woo-Ping's action direction feels a little hampered with the overused slow-motion approach undertaken by the director. Still, the film is better than most. It presents itself similar to a stage play (which is fine, it is ""Hamlet"") but I believe this style does hurt the film a little. The film is carefully and superbly arranged with characters well-mannered that even assassins conduct themselves politely even in the face of blood. The Banquet is more a period drama than a Wuxia film, in fact, I believe the film could have survived without any martial arts action.

Amazingly beautiful Zhang Ziyi struggles to carry the film. As good and beautiful the actress is, even Zhang cannot carry a film all by herself. Her portrayal of Empress Wan is actually the film's center; Zhang's character is in the middle of deception, lust and eventual betrayal. Thankfully, Zhang has the charisma to pull off an underdeveloped character such as Empress Wan. However, Zhang feels a bit unseasoned and too young (perhaps) for the role of the empress. Don't get me wrong, I think Zhang Ziyi is an awesome actress, but the role feels tailor-made for Chinese veteran actress Gong Li. Daniel Wu plays Wu Luan; a brooding, quiet and never shows his emotions in calculating vengeance. Wu plays an acceptable performance, after all, he does play ""Hamlet"" which was meant as a person with minor momentum, instead of displaying raw anger he imposes his wrath through indirect means. I guess it was a good move for the screenplay to emphasize Empress Wan's character than Wu Luan himself, I doubt Daniel Wu will be able to carry the film at all.

The performances are good for the most part. It's just that the characters seemed a bit underdeveloped that the lead characters will have some difficulty connecting with its audience. The film does take off strongly but it couldn't stay aloft. Supporting actress Zhao Xun (Ming Ming) has huge talent but her character of Quing is too simple and a bit one-dimensional. Ge You comes out with an outstanding performance as Emperor Li; his powerful portrayal is truly superb and note-worthy. Ultimately, while this film is loosely based on ""Hamlet"", the climax does occur in a banquet and this is a Chinese film where the old adage applies: No evil deed will go unpunished and repaid.

The Banquet is a very difficult film to judge. The film feels too mainstream for a Wuxia Epic drama and it seems geared towards international audiences and not to the people of Feng's native land. The film is definitely a part of the superficial, overindulgent popular Chinese film for viewers in the U.S. It is not a contemporary Wuxia film but rather one so polished for international acclaim (then again, I've read it was its intention). The lack of emotions and character depth never allows the film to surpass its gorgeous costumes and set designs. The film does succeed in the classic manipulations and plots of betrayal; but ultimately, the lasting impression is how beautifully shot and expensive the film is that it falls a bit short of epic grandeur. The film is better than most, it is better than Chen Kaige's ""The Promise"" but if you saw ""HERO"" and "" HOUSE of FLYING DAGGERS""; the film just cannot surpass the coldness of its exterior.

3046065,4,B00104AYGK,"The version I bought doesn't have the same cover art as this one does, but is a beautifully packaged Chinese Collector's Edition with a portrait of the fabulously beautiful actress and heroine of this story, Zhang Ziyi, as she stars in her first adult role, that of the Dowager Empress.  Some observers have suggested that this movie (La Legende de la Scorpion Noir, in my French voice-over) or BANQUET, on the cover, is based on Shakespeare's HAMLET.  That may ultimately be true.  However, though there are similarities, it need not become a distraction.

If BANQUET were a Shakespeare adaptation, it might remind one of THRONE OF BLOOD, the Japanese take on MACBETH, or RAN, Kurosawa's thrilling take on KING LEAR.  However, in that case one views the HAMLET story, through the eyes of the Prince, who detests the marriage of his mother, Queen Gertrude, to her brother-in-law and his uncle, King Claudius.  In that case, the problem is what to do with her son, the heir to the throne?

In this re-writing, before the story even begins, she Zhang Ziyi was not the prince's young mother, but his young fiancee.  No incest problem.  The death of the Emperor and the resultant confusion at court is only intensified when she agrees to marry the new Emperor (her brother-in-law) and the Prince goes into hiding in a kind of Monastary/Theatre School, specializing in poetry and dance.

The film begins, actually, as a messenger of the Court arrives to invite the prince to return to Court, only minutes before a squad of assassins sent by the Emperor arrives, to kill him.  He escapes, and makes his way back to Court and lives there under the protection of the new Empress, his former fiancee, who loves him at least as much as she loves the prestiege and power of her new position.  In this story, all the problems of the situation are hers, not the Prince's.

Eventually we learn that the former Emperor was murdered (by his brother, it seems) by means of a powdered compound made in part from the essence of a black scorpion which is blown into the victim's ear, through a feather.  That's a detail very like the murder of Hamlet's father, by a poison in liquid form poured into his ear.

Another similarity to the Hamlet story is the adoration of a young woman of the Court for the Prince.  As with Ophelia, his feelings about this innocent and loving girl are sexual, but ambiguous, and cannot be resolved.

The most striking difference between the two stories of Court intrigue is that here, there are no ghosts, and the Prince does not ever hallucinate his father.

But all these details are superficial distractions.  My advice is to abandon if you can, every reference you've heard between this film and the Shakespeare play, and simply sit back, relex and enjoy an historical drama of psychological complexity, produced with exceptional beauty and style, and played skillfully by some of the best film actors you'll ever see, in a specifically Chinese historical context, but with universal appeal.  The music is good, the sets and costumes are georgeous, and often spectacular, and if you follow the characters and their relations with one another, you will grasp and enjoy the story in its entirety.  The cultural differences between this production and any European story of similar type, are unavoidable; however the human emotions that motivate the characters are universal.  The behaviors of the characters may puzzle children and adolescents, they will not trouble adults at all.

BANQUET, or CURSE (or venom, actually) OF THE BLACK SCORPION is a piece of adult entertainment in the grand style.",1263686400,2,3610,4.862745098039215

I no nothing about Hamlet, I'm not a fan of Shakespeare at all, and I found the plot of this film very complicated.  I need to see it again a few more times.  So mainly I just read the subtitles, look at the the beautiful cinematography and listen to the score.  I really didn't understand the ending, it was so abrubt and confusing. I'm sure it will all make sense with later viewings. I hope they continue to make amazing Chinese films like this, I own all of them.  These are almost the best movies around right now.

This tale is an interesting version of a female Hamlet type love story that has its breath taking rises and falls as the story progresses. The costumes,uniforms, and background scenery the colors the padgentry is truly romantic and true to the age as well as the breath taking artistic input, it is simply a must see. The martial arts fighting scenes through-out the film, the flowing rythmic dance moves during the banquet, the tragic empothy you feel in each melody comes together so gracefuly without over shadowing the drive of the tale and feeling true to each scene. The icing to this marvelous mixture is the soul stirring theme song composed by Tan Dun titled ""Only For Love"", that plays prominently from the last scene through out most of the credits and the stiring vocals in Mandarin is a touch of class as this movie leaves you weeping and awe stricken for the ride you just took.

3046070,5,B00104AYGK,"There's no point in rehashing the premise/actors/other details of this film, as other reviewers are hitting it.  I'll simply make my arguments.

I agree that this film, for all its depiction of treachery and pathos, is cold and cerebral.  I agree that the action is also depicted on a very cerebral level: it is so stylized that it is robbed of its intensity--certainly robbed of the visceral aspect that would appeal to those who are looking for an action movie.  So I certainly advise against it for those looking for a great martial arts film.  Check out ""Tai Chi Master"" or ""Fong Sai Yuk"" for that!

What is left after the emotional attachments and thrill of combat are removed?  A purely aesthetic masterpiece.  This is truly an ""art"" film: sight and sound combine in moving paintings, symbols, and stylized archetypes.

You will not be drawn in by the story and the characters.  You will be drawn in by the crystalline imagery and sound that form an alternate universe in which everything is perfect form, hypnotic motion.  Beautiful images are frozen in space and time, haunting music and movement and color supersede all other concerns.

We know Hamlet.  We know this story.  We know these characters.  Here story and character are cyphers.  In this film the source Hamlet simply functions as a framework to hang a filmed aesthetic, a transformation of the world into stylized form.  Is it enough?  Is this all that is necessary to make a great film?  Yes.  If you are sensitive to it, you will be stunned and enthralled.  If you are not, you will be bored.",1243555200,15,1565,4.722222222222222

I will say however that unlike Hamlet, this movie does not have a nicely resolved ending. In fact, there may be many who might either be disappointed or confused by it.

3046074,4,B00104AYGK,"Visually stunning.  Impeccable sets, costumes and makeup and wonderfully shot.

While this movie has been labeled as ""wuxia"" and many viewers seem to have watched it ""for the fight scenes,"" it's not about the fight scenes at all (and there aren't many of them). Actually, a few of them were completely unnecessary and disrupted the flow of the movie (despite how pretty and ballet-like they are).  The director probably tacked them on to sell it as a martial arts movie and attract more audiences in the west.  So if you're watching the movie for fight scenes, you'll be disappointed.

The Banquet is an interesting mix of western and eastern elements.  While the backbone of the plot is undeniably Hamlet/Macbeth, the different parts of the overall story were definitely nothing new in Chinese history.  The only tidbit that was blatantly Shakespearean was the performance of ""Hamlet's"" play portraying his father's murder before the court.  The director did emphasize the theatrical quality of the film by employing slow, stilted, somewhat affected speech cadences.  Hence some may complain about the under-emoting, which is an effect of trying to establish ""a play within a movie.""

My gripe with the movie is that certain scenes seemed very out-of-place and contrived.  There are also moments when the characters would change moods and behavior quite suddenly.

What I thought was great about this movie (aside from the visuals) was the dialogue.  Since the emoting was toned down quite a bit, sometimes you can only glean what the characters really think from the words they are using.  The subtle insinuations and suggestions between the Empress and the new Emperor were especially delicious.  However, during some of the odd scenes mentioned above, the characters can utter some ridiculously trite sayings.

The film has a good score, and the main theme (the song that the prince brings back with him) is haunting.  The thoroughly modern end theme, however, seems a little anachronistic.

Another note about the ending (no spoilers): there's a reason why the director decided to end it the way he did.  The people who find it unsatisfying probably don't get the message he's trying to send.

Overall a truly great film.  Very beautiful and great lines.  Plus Zhang Ziyi and Ge You are spot on in their roles.  Be prepared for a long play on film.  Do not watch it if you're only interested in martial arts, but stay if you're into political intrigue and soul-twisting effects of desire.",1239321600,5,2493,5.009732360097324

The narrow range of emotions displayed doesn't involve us. The thousands of waiting minions thing was interesting, the first time. The fight scenes seem added on to try to inject some life into this sloth. A fight scene must be filmed and especially edited correctly or it will present as a bunch of unrelated blurs of action, uninvolving to us folks that crave this action. This film is maybe 50% guilty of this. Near the beginning there is a savage attack on what looks like a mime school. The mimes just strike those goofy ""mime poses"" and allow themselves to be slaughtered without resistance, it just appears dumb. There seems to be a genre in China nowadays that specializes in intimate examination of historical supremely decadent emperor's and their courts. There is always treachery and disloyalty. Always a tragic ending. Overall though, the film is well made. It is sumptuous in it's high court details. I would like the emoting/drama turned up a few notches.

A spectacular Chinese adaptation of Hamlet filmed on an epic scale with no expense spared and with all the action scenes that Shakespeare forgot to write, it's clearly aiming to be another Hero, with nods to Akira Kurosawa's Japanese samurai Shakespeare films along the way. Although it never quite hits the same highs, it works surprisingly well, with Daniel Wu's Crown Prince brooding over his father's murder by his uncle while his former beloved Ziyi Zhang is consumed by revenge in her desire to kill the new emperor as courtiers plot and intrigue around them. With superb art direction by Tim Yip, excellent cinematography by Li Zhang, striking fight sequences courtesy of Yuen Wo-Ping at his best and a fine score by Tan Dun (Andrew Lloyd Webberish end title song notwithstanding) and filled with colour, light and movement, it's always a treat for the eyes and ears, especially in this  2.35:1 widescreen transfer.",1219536000,5,1078,4.988888888888889
3280431,5,B00104AYGK,"Well, I seem to have developed a taste for Asian ""art house"" type movies, especially martial arts epics with great choreographed fight sequences, vivid colors, interesting storylines.

Each of them has its strengths and weaknesses.

Getting back to Legend of the Black Scorpion, from my understanding, it's a Chinese martial arts retelling of Shakespeare's play Hamlet. While I don't think I've seen or read Hamlet, I don't think it's essential to have previously read it or seen it to understand what's going on here.

Similar in theme to Curse of the Golden Flower, Legend of the Black Scorpion is a martial arts / drama piece about Chinese dynastic royalty and empire. Though it mainly focuses on the family / political dynamics of the royal court, with various plots to seize power, etc.

A number of the fight scenes have an almost ballet-like quality about them. They're often more like a well-choreographed dance than a battle per se. It makes sense, insofar as there is also a sub-plot about the crown prince taking up the arts of Chinese song and dance.

Now, one thing that I noted was the overemphasis on blood in this film. it spurts, it gushes, it drips everywhere. There seems to be a special focus on showing the blood itself, sometimes in slow motion. I thought it was excessive, and I'm not sure why so much attention was paid to emphasizing blood and bloodiness in this film.

The blood issue was minor to me, as I'm more-or-less desensitized to it at this point. Overall, I really liked this movie though (outside of the blood and brutality of some scenes). I thought the sets and costuming were colorful and first rate. The choreography was great. Etc. I think it makes a good addition to the other ""art house"" type movies listed above.

I'd certainly take this movie over&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Butterfly-Sword/dp/B00022PZJC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Butterfly Sword</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warriors-of-Heaven-and-Earth/dp/B000683VH0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warriors of Heaven and Earth</a>&nbsp;(neither of which I particularly cared for, despite decent reviews on Amazon and/or DVD Empire).

3280434,3,B00104AYGK,"The Legend of Black Scorpion is a phenomenal blend of scenery and style as the director uses operatic appeal in the form of the metaphorical phantom to stylize the sequential and breath-taking coreographic kung fu, especially as exemplified in the hide-away forests where the endangered and practically deposed crown-prince drowns in his sorrow, overwhelmed by the injustice of his uncle, the murderous usurper of the throne.
While this is the most fantastic scene, the flow is maintained to a great degree throughout the film. HOWEVER, a great disappointment like many previous kung fu movies, for example, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Jet Li's ""Hero"" and House of Flying Daggers, and not to mention Curse of the Golden Flower. Somehow, Shakespearean endings do not suit these martial arts. Eastern Philosophy is characterized by some forms of exquisite closure and transcendence, and these movies have none. Moreover, the kung fu was not enough. The movie gave a blast of unparalleled kung fu in the fighting scene at the prince's hide-away and from there took a down-hill turn into just drama. We watch these because we love to see a man being ""kung-fu-ed"" to death, not to see a woman killed by a sword or knife protruding from nowhere and no one. These directors need to snap out of the Shakespeareanism, be true to Eastern tradition in martial arts and give us closure and stop with the romance. SOMEHOW, romance always absolutely spoils a martial arts film. There are no really great martial arts films being produced today and the lack of closure without a sequel is incomplete artistry that detracts of satisfaction.

This film is a good example of what has almost become a genre - films that attempt to duplicate the success of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""  We've bought and seen ""Hero,"" ""House of Flying Daggers,"" and ""Curse of the Golden Flower.""  They all have the near-flying martial arts, expertly choreographed fights and gorgeous costumes.  We enjoyed them all, but where these films fall short, including Black Scorpion, is the stories lack the magic of CTHD.  That tale of unattainable love, wrapped in a mystery was original, with superb acting and a new take on action.  This one would have been better served to follow Hamlet more closely as the changes they made did NOT improve the story.  They slowed the movie down, or caused confusion.  And the movie was very slowly paced to begin with.

The story is focused on the empress' point of view, rather than the prince as in Hamlet.  That works just fine, as Ziyi Zhang is captivating in the role.  She gives life to what could have been an awful movie rather than just a disappointing one.  The old emperor dies from a Scorpion bite and his brother usurps the throne from the prince and steals the empress, who had already been stolen from the crown prince by the last emperor.  Familiar characters appear, from Polonius, to Ophelia (who is the best represented character in the film) to Laertes and the royal family.  We have the mousetrap play, wherein the prince does indeed catch the conscience of a king and the kill all the lawyers ending.  Except, the ending has a distracting and confusing change that leaves the viewer hanging - literally.  I won't spoil it, but one of the main characters dies after the climactic confrontation, but who does the deed is never revealed and is all the more confusing since everybody who is anybody has already died or been exiled!

As to this edition, the DVD does have a dubbed track available and is very well done.  After 15 minutes, I forgot it was being dubbed.  Though it is a two disc edition, there is nothing spectacular in the extras.  The making of featurette is perhaps the most interesting, but there are also two translated interviews and a behind the scenes bit.  There is no extra footage, or featurettes on costumes, or better yet a piece on the historical time period.

Overall, if you enjoyed the other films you'll enjoy this one though likely not as much.  If you've never read Hamlet, you'll like it even more. I recommend the single disc edition over paying so much for 2 discs, but some viewers will enjoy the extras.  Cautiously recommended.",1205280000,20,2801,4.700205338809035

3280440,4,B00104AYGK,"LEGEND OF THE BLACK SCORPION (a.k.a. The BANQUET) is the Chinese rendition of Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"". Directed by Mainland China's own acclaimed director Feng Xiaogang, joined with the lush cinematography by Tim Yip (Croaching Tiger Hidden Dragon) and the action choreography by Yuen Woo-Ping( Fearless); the film is set to bring Chinese Wuxia epic to new heights. Feng even acquired the services of one of China's most renowned international actresses; Zhang Ziyi.
The film was released in Asia in 2006( before ""Curse of the Golden Flower""), set for the American market but for reasons unknown, ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" was marketed instead to U.S. shores.

Synopsis loosely derived from Media Asia DVD back cover:
The story is set in ancient China during the period of Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms. Against this backdrop of internal turmoil and external threat poised by the neighboring Khitan Empires, lives Empress Wan (Zhang Ziyi). As beautiful as she is limber, she harbors forbidden desires for her stepson Crown Prince Wu Luan (Daniel Wu). When the Emperor dies of reasons undetermined and his younger brother Li takes the throne, Wan marries Li to protect Wu Luan and seal her own position in the ruling body. But Li is not a fool and dispatches assassins that ultimately fail to kill Wu Luan. When Emperor Li proclaims a big banquet, Wu Luan and Wan realize it is time to strike.

The Banquet (I prefer to call it by its original title) is a beautiful film; elaborate costumes and set designs are the main draw of the film. Frankly, I liked this film's cinematography, atmosphere and set designs more than ""Curse of the Golden Flower"". The film simply looks astounding, the colors and way it is shot is truly amazing. However, beauty and cinematography can only carry a film so far. The expectations for ""The Banquet"" are extremely high, and while it does succeed as a high-quality spectacle that is a visual and aural feast; it fails to deliver on emotions and its characters. Even Yuen Woo-Ping's action direction feels a little hampered with the overused slow-motion approach undertaken by the director. Still, the film is better than most. It presents itself similar to a stage play (which is fine, it is ""Hamlet"") but I believe this style does hurt the film a little. The film is carefully and superbly arranged with characters well-mannered that even assassins conduct themselves politely even in the face of blood. The Banquet is more a period drama than a Wuxia film, in fact, I believe the film could have survived without any martial arts action.

Amazingly beautiful Zhang Ziyi struggles to carry the film. As good and beautiful the actress is, even Zhang cannot carry a film all by herself. Her portrayal of Empress Wan is actually the film's center; Zhang's character is in the middle of deception, lust and eventual betrayal. Thankfully, Zhang has the charisma to pull off an underdeveloped character such as Empress Wan. However, Zhang feels a bit unseasoned and too young (perhaps) for the role of the empress. Don't get me wrong, I think Zhang Ziyi is an awesome actress, but the role feels tailor-made for Chinese veteran actress Gong Li. Daniel Wu plays Wu Luan; a brooding, quiet and never shows his emotions in calculating vengeance. Wu plays an acceptable performance, after all, he does play ""Hamlet"" which was meant as a person with minor momentum, instead of displaying raw anger he imposes his wrath through indirect means. I guess it was a good move for the screenplay to emphasize Empress Wan's character than Wu Luan himself, I doubt Daniel Wu will be able to carry the film at all.

The performances are good for the most part. It's just that the characters seemed a bit underdeveloped that the lead characters will have some difficulty connecting with its audience. The film does take off strongly but it couldn't stay aloft. Supporting actress Zhao Xun (Ming Ming) has huge talent but her character of Quing is too simple and a bit one-dimensional. Ge You comes out with an outstanding performance as Emperor Li; his powerful portrayal is truly superb and note-worthy. Ultimately, while this film is loosely based on ""Hamlet"", the climax does occur in a banquet and this is a Chinese film where the old adage applies: No evil deed will go unpunished and repaid.

The Banquet is a very difficult film to judge. The film feels too mainstream for a Wuxia Epic drama and it seems geared towards international audiences and not to the people of Feng's native land. The film is definitely a part of the superficial, overindulgent popular Chinese film for viewers in the U.S. It is not a contemporary Wuxia film but rather one so polished for international acclaim (then again, I've read it was its intention). The lack of emotions and character depth never allows the film to surpass its gorgeous costumes and set designs. The film does succeed in the classic manipulations and plots of betrayal; but ultimately, the lasting impression is how beautifully shot and expensive the film is that it falls a bit short of epic grandeur. The film is better than most, it is better than Chen Kaige's ""The Promise"" but if you saw ""HERO"" and "" HOUSE of FLYING DAGGERS""; the film just cannot surpass the coldness of its exterior.

3280442,5,B00104AYGK,"A marvelous expression / Interpretation of Hamlet within the culture of China - concerned with the ideological aspect of Shakespeare and not a word for word translation. Artfully scripted by  Gangjian Qiu and directed by Feng Xiaogang (look these guys up if you don't know their work. They put out many worthy works) the movie is a beautiful wedding of Greek, English and Chinese elements. Staged in a theatrical style the presentation is executed at once in a limited view (the stage) and expansive as the stage often explodes in action with players floating around and one time they enter the scene floating on bamboo tree tops as seen in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. They also display three dimensional movement by floating in and out of view and fighting / flying to the various levels of a multidimensional structure built on a beautiful set. The incorporation of Greek flavor is accommodated by Greek style mask worn by the players in some beautifully executed performance. Their contribution to the films artistry and imaginative makeup is wonderful. The acrobatics performance of the wushu players is done with a visual grace and refinement throughout that should please any fan of wushu theater.

The director displays remarkable restraint in maintaining an even, steady purposeful pace throughout the production. I've read that some consider the pace slow at times! I sometimes found the films pace a challenge to my will and my ability to hold my emotions in check so I did not race ahead of the presentation. This excertion of self control created a level of suspense and tension between the film and myself that I very much appreciated as it forced me to match the pace of my emotions with what I saw unfolding before me. A wonderful experience as I was able to see and appreciate the refinement of the players brilliance. Every moment is well done and should be appreciated for the quality on display throughout. For example; I enjoyed the performance of the masked players as so well done I found myself completely drawn into their visually artistic and, I thought, ingenious performances.

Singing is an important component in the Chinese traditional theater. The singing in this interpretation is wonderful. Teeg Geer has a vocal ability capable of summoning the spiritual expression of any soul listening to his wonderful interpretation of the play. Of course, this is Shakespeare, and lust and ambition drive several characters to the conclusion which is a who done it killing. You will be well rewarded for the scant price of this blue ray. You may even find yourself watching it several times finding new gems with each viewing, ENJOY",1496793600,2,2658,4.981981981981982

3280485,4,B00104AYGK,"I liked this highly original 2006 Chinese adaptation of ""Hamlet"", even if it has some flaws. I spend a rather pleasant moment watching it. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

China, X century, the end of the Tang Dynasty. The Crown Prince, Wu Luan (Daniel Wu) and one of ladies of the imperial court, Little Wan (Zhang Ziyi) are in love - but the Emperor, after seeing Little Wan, takes her as his Empress and orders Wu Luan to marry another woman, lady Qing Nu (Zhou Xun). Wu Luan, deeply hurt, refuses and goes in voluntary exile in the province to devote himself to study music and dance - his extravagant behaviour makes that some people believe that he went insane with grief. Soon after, the Emperor is murdered - many believe that the killer was his brother Li (Ge You), who became the new Emperor. The new Emperor retains Little Wan as his Empress and recalls the Crown Prince from the exile. Soon factions form in the court, one supporting the new Emperor, the other the Crown Prince who is expected to seek revenge for the murder of his father. His return is especially expected by Lady Qing Nu, who, albeit not wanted by Wu Luan, is very much in love with him... And then the film really begins...

From the first minutes of the film it is obvious, that this is NOT exactly the story of ""Hamlet"", as there are important modifications. Hamlet's mother was replaced by a younger woman, whom he was in love with. The stealing of the bride of the Crown Prince by his older father is in fact an echo of one such very famous incident in Chinese history, when in 738 emperor Xuanzong took from one of his sons his young wife, the archi-famous Yang Guifei. The relationship between Wu Luan and Qing Nu is somehow different than the one between Hamlet and Ophelia. Wu Luan is somehow more assertive and less hesitating than Hamlet. Many elements are added, like court intrigues, fights, escapes and elaborate assassination attempts. Last but not least, the final fate of Wu Luan's evil uncle, Emperor Li, is very different from the one in ""Hamlet"" - and honestly, that was actually for me the weakest thing in the whole film. On another hand, the ending is in its general lines very Shakespearian...

It seems unavoidable that idiotic kung fu and other surrealistic fights must be introduced in almost every Chinese production - in this film martial arts are present, but thanks God not as much as I feared... Visually this film is splendid, actors play very well and Zhang Ziyi is incredibly beautiful.

In Europe this film was released under the much more appropriate title ""The banquet"" - the title adopted for USA is really not very good, as it suggests some kind of martial arts B movie. Which is definitely not the case...

Although not really a masterpiece, this is a good, original, very entertaining film. I am very glad that I bought and watched it and I think I will keep the DVD for another viewing. ENJOY!",1446508800,2,2944,4.6106870229007635

3280536,5,B00104AYGK,"Just finished watching LOTBS today and I must admit that this is now one of my favorites. I have always been a fan of asian cinema because of it's penchant for delivering authentic period depictions of samurai, geisha and the ruling class and their way of life. BTW, I own the bluray versions of Ran, Sansho the Bailiff, Kagemusha, Kuroneko, Rashomon and Yojimbo as well as dvd's of Chushingura, Kwaidan, Onibaba, Goyokin, Throne of Blood and Flowers of Shanghai so I'm not just a casual fan. While some of these films are considered timeless classics of world cinema, still others have been ignored and dismissed. Crouching Tiger made martials arts movies popular again and it truly is an amazing film yet it does not have a monopoly on terrific story telling, sumptuous visuals and operatic combat. While Tiger is the more kinetic and exhilarating of the two movies, I feel that Black Scorpion pacts the greater dramatic impact. While some may consider the slow pacing and long takes to be a tad dull or boring, that is merely the reaction of the uninitiated. All of the movies I named earlier also feature measured pacing and some formal ceremonies or traditions that may lose those viewers who can't appreciate their authenticity. This movie boasts stunning cinematography, sharp dialogue and outstanding period detail. The casting is dead on and the acting is first rate. This is a must see!",1375833600,,1396,4.894514767932489
3280537,2,B00104AYGK,"Bought this movie thinking it was gonna be an epic war movie or martial art.  It was neither.  It was more drama than action.  Terrible plot, lousy script.  Some of the scenes were too long or simply unnecessary.  I couldn't wait for the movie to end.  How this movie got such a high rating on Amazon is beyond me.  Makes me wonder about the credibility of Amazon reviews.  This movie only receives a 5 or 6 out of 10 on other movie sites.

If you want fast action, epic war movie, martial art stuff, stay away from this movie.  If you want long slow drama, this may be your cup of tea.",1375056000,2,586,4.151785714285714
3280538,2,B00104AYGK,"Legend of the Black Scorpion is a disappointment given the who's who involved and the story. From director Feng Xiaogang to actors Ge You and Zhang Ziyi, it is loaded with talent, but it comes across as little more than beautiful but empty.

For starters, the movie drags. Slightly over two hours seemed much longer as the story crawls along to the inevitable (to anyone familiar with Hamlet) conclusion. It is a dialogue and scenery driven film and the dialogue is simply not up to Shakespeare even if the gorgeous scenery and plentitude of colors gives one much to admire.

Ge You does as well as he can, but his role is a lot of slow line delivery and dramatic pauses. Also, he makes his character perhaps a bit too sympathetic, despite the manner in which he came into power. On the other hand, Zhang Ziyi seems miscast as the empress dowager, plodding along with whispered treachery and her trademark devilish smile, but all the while seeming far too young. Zhou Xun is fairly wasted in an underdeveloped role as a pining lover, and Daniel Wu plays the Hamlet-ish role with an unfortunately cool demeanor.

In the end, The Legend of the Black Scorpion (aka The Banquet) seems to have fallen short of its own lofty goals. Given how many other fantastic films there are from China, you can pass on this and try some of the others. From this director, I recommend If You Are The One (also starring Ge You), or two other choices would be The Road Home with Zhang or To Live (with Gong Li), both directed by Zhang Yimou.",1369612800,,1520,4.54014598540146

3280543,5,B00104AYGK,"Originally titled ""The Banquet"" (English translation), Legend proves that Chinese movie making is finally in the big league with Hollywood.  The photography is artful and exquisite.  The acting renders the ""inscrutability"" of stereotypical Chinese at once both nuanced and comprehensible to this westerner, although I'll admit that it took me a while to fully understand some of the motivations after struggling with the subtitles.  Perhaps most impressive are the sets which fairly well evoke the grandeur of the imperial court.

The additional features are worth watching later, as they show the issues which confront Chinese movie makers and actors are very much the same as for their western counterparts.  Perhaps the most concise appraisal of the movie is that it isn't so much a martial arts film, as much as it is an art film with (superbly choreographed) fight scenes.  Me thinks Shakespeare would have been proud (of the plot.)",1354752000,,937,5.213333333333333

3280545,4,B00104AYGK,"There are wuxia movies, and there are wuxia Films. This is the latter.
Rich with stunning visuals, this movie contains musical numbers, traditional dance pieces, a brief play, and the sort of action and fight sequences that Yuen Wo Ping is known for. I would have cast different actors in one or two roles (the Emperor certainly and the Prince perhaps), but good grief! The sets! The costumes! In the opening scene, the Prince is in seclusion in a monastery the likes of which I've never seen before. I kept my disk from Netflix for 2 weeks because I couldn't stop watching this film. I finally had to order my own.
It is a very stylized work, full of formality, and much of the time, the visuals and the musical score just hit a sweet spot that makes everything about it seem very lush. As it is, you'll swear they filmed it in front of a live orchestra.  If the acting was a tad better, it would rank right up there with House of Flying Daggers and Hero (excepting Jet Li's wooden performance). As it is, it surpasses Curse of the Golden Flower, which ultimately portrayed the palace as a landscape of restricted spaces. Watching this, you could imagine that the Forbidden City goes on forever.",1342310400,,1196,4.537037037037037
3280546,5,B00104AYGK,"I very much enjoyed this film. I found it a very compelling and wonderfully told tale. Yes, it does move at a leisurely pace, but as every frame of this film is such a beautiful tapestry to view, the pace is perfect. Be warned, the bloodletting and the acts of violence are filmed as lovingly as the dance movements that are part of the storyline. While it is much more graphic than some, it is not gratuitous.

I liked the storyline, and the clear parallels to Hamlet, yet this is a storyline in its own right. I found the characters beautifully drawn and superbly acted. The sets, the costumes, the attention to details throughout the production... all are simply stunning.

If you like films of this type, add this to your collection. You will be glad you did. One additional note, after watching the film, be sure to set aside a time to watch it again with the audio commentary. There is much information about the various elements of the storyline and the choices that were made.

3280551,1,B00104AYGK,"I will give this film it's due: cinematography was magnificent.  But epic scenery is not enough to warrant two hours wasted on this film.  The balance of the film was totally disappointing.  Spoiler alert!  By the end of the film every major character is dead.  But so what, as with perhaps a single exception we have not developed any real feeling for any of them.

Plot lines are frequently introduced with no reason and often disposed of without effect.  As mentioned, the characters are presented without any true development or depth.  We have little or no appreciation for their motivation except by what is more often implied than stated.  The pace of the film is ponderous, more like a cross-country trek across the frozen Russian wilderness.  The martial arts sequences are just too often silly.  No degree of suspense of disbelief will succeed in making the conflicts acceptable.  The wire work, while perhaps novel and interesting in its first or second usage, is tedious and again, silly.  It truly makes one wonder why the actors employed horses so often in the film when they might have more efficiently just levitated from point to point.

3280552,5,B00104AYGK,"I should probably preface this review by saying that my movie collection is primarily dominated with Asian cinema and with that being said there is not a better blending of east and west than Legend Of The Black Scorpion. For all of you who were never in High School, Hamlet is the classic Shakespearean story about betrayal and revenge and this movie brings a brand new flavor to the story all together. The style is your neo classical Chinese setting per movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and the martial arts are actually used rather sparingly but what martial arts are actually featured are very refreshing and don't rely too heavily on wires. This is one of the few movies I have seen that really doesn't betray the central themes and plot of Hamlet but at the same time really make the story it's own entity. It takes so many of the main characters and really develops them in different ways but you always get the feelings they are supposed to evoke as characters in the Shakespearean story. So really what this movie lacks in following in the play it more than makes up for in the way it conveys the themes of the play. As some other reviews have said this movie is definitely geared more towards the Asian audience, dealing with some heavy themes that most western audiences aren't quite as used to and features quite a bit of the typical Chinese story archetypes but at the same time they seem to work well off of each other and work in perfect harmony.",1320278400,,1472,4.558490566037736

I have always been a fan of Asian cinema ever since I was born obviously as any one who has read my stuff before will tell you. As I have collected film after film and anime after anime [I hunt down the live action while my girl hunts down all anime] I'd like to think I have a pretty good collection. That is why when the Weinstein Brothers created the Dragon Dynasty company to introduce more of these films to an American audience. Here we have the very beautiful ""Legend of the Black Scorpion"" or ""The Banquet"" in its entire glorious splendor, it really is a wonderfully shot film.

This film is a take on Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" and tries to tell that story in a new way, on some levels it works and on others it fails. Directed by Xiaogang Feng this film is very amazing as far as style and cinematography but the storytelling lacks a little, underdeveloped characters hamper the film a bit. Still there is a lot good with this film and is worthy of your time but be prepared as it does move a bit slow. But it is based on a really well known and famous play so it has elements that will be appealing to the average viewer.

Empress Wan (Ziyi Zhang) has lost her husband and is now being put into a relationship with her brother in law Emperor Li (You Ge) as he wants the power of the kingdom. The thing is she has a thing for her step son Prince Wu Luan (Daniel Wu), and this is not lost on Emperor Li. He hires some assassins to kill the prince so that there will be no competition to the throne. But they fail to do so and the prince makes his way back to the kingdom. Upon arriving it is announced by the Emperor that there will be a banquet and it is in this a plan is devised to end the Emperor.

The film starts very strong and is at its most enjoyable throughout the first half of the film, but it starts to lack and can't keep the pace going. Also like I said before the film is beautiful and just amazingly shot, to be honest it really is a spectacle for the eyes more often than not. The astonishing and breathtaking cinematography mixed with wonderful scenery and sets make this a wonder to the retina. Add in the wonderful atmosphere and great slow motion fight scenes this is a good film.

But that does not mean it is a perfect movie, in fact one of its positives is also a negative. The slow motion fight sequences tend to be over used a bit here, it is better than it is bad but it is still an issue. Still the biggest flaw of the film is the lack of character development, for such a beautiful film there is a lack of emotion from the characters that can not be over looked. Ziyi Zhang does a good job here as does everyone really but the script did not add enough depth to the characters. To be honest this really did have a good chance at being a classic, any film that has Yuen Woo-Ping, Tim Yip, Li Zhang, and Xiaogang Feng behind the scenes had that potential.

The film does not reach that classic status but is very much worth a look if you have never seen it. The original release of course is great but for any American fan that may be interested may want to pick up the Dragon Dynasty release. It is comes with some great special features in a 2 disc collection including a great commentary track with Bey Logan. Of course the behind the scenes and all that stuff is featured as well, so I do recommend getting this film.",1284681600,,3384,4.1984615384615385
3280559,5,B00104AYGK,"LEGEND OF THE BLACK SCORPION (a.k.a. The BANQUET) is the Chinese rendition of Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"". Directed by Mainland China's own acclaimed director Feng Xiaogang, joined with the lush cinematography by Tim Yip (Croaching Tiger Hidden Dragon) and the action choreography by Yuen Woo-Ping( Fearless); the film is set to bring Chinese Wuxia epic to new heights. Feng even acquired the services of one of China's most renowned international actresses; Zhang Ziyi.
The film was released in Asia in 2006( before ""Curse of the Golden Flower""), set for the American market but for reasons unknown, ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" was marketed instead to U.S. shores.

Synopsis loosely derived from Media Asia DVD back cover:
The story is set in ancient China during the period of Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms. Against this backdrop of internal turmoil and external threat poised by the neighboring Khitan Empires, lives Empress Wan (Zhang Ziyi). As beautiful as she is limber, she harbors forbidden desires for her stepson Crown Prince Wu Luan (Daniel Wu). When the Emperor dies of reasons undetermined and his younger brother Li takes the throne, Wan marries Li to protect Wu Luan and seal her own position in the ruling body. But Li is not a fool and dispatches assassins that ultimately fail to kill Wu Luan. When Emperor Li proclaims a big banquet, Wu Luan and Wan realize it is time to strike.

The Banquet (I prefer to call it by its original title) is a beautiful film; elaborate costumes and set designs are the main draw of the film. Frankly, I liked this film's cinematography, atmosphere and set designs more than ""Curse of the Golden Flower"". The film simply looks astounding, the colors and way it is shot is truly amazing. However, beauty and cinematography can only carry a film so far. The expectations for ""The Banquet"" are extremely high, and while it does succeed as a high-quality spectacle that is a visual and aural feast; it fails to deliver on emotions and its characters. Even Yuen Woo-Ping's action direction feels a little hampered with the overused slow-motion approach undertaken by the director. Still, the film is better than most. It presents itself similar to a stage play (which is fine, it is ""Hamlet"") but I believe this style does hurt the film a little. The film is carefully and superbly arranged with characters well-mannered that even assassins conduct themselves politely even in the face of blood. The Banquet is more a period drama than a Wuxia film, in fact, I believe the film could have survived without any martial arts action.

Amazingly beautiful Zhang Ziyi struggles to carry the film. As good and beautiful the actress is, even Zhang cannot carry a film all by herself. Her portrayal of Empress Wan is actually the film's center; Zhang's character is in the middle of deception, lust and eventual betrayal. Thankfully, Zhang has the charisma to pull off an underdeveloped character such as Empress Wan. However, Zhang feels a bit unseasoned and too young (perhaps) for the role of the empress. Don't get me wrong, I think Zhang Ziyi is an awesome actress, but the role feels tailor-made for Chinese veteran actress Gong Li. Daniel Wu plays Wu Luan; a brooding, quiet and never shows his emotions in calculating vengeance. Wu plays an acceptable performance, after all, he does play ""Hamlet"" which was meant as a person with minor momentum, instead of displaying raw anger he imposes his wrath through indirect means. I guess it was a good move for the screenplay to emphasize Empress Wan's character than Wu Luan himself, I doubt Daniel Wu will be able to carry the film at all.

The performances are good for the most part. It's just that the characters seemed a bit underdeveloped that the lead characters will have some difficulty connecting with its audience. The film does take off strongly but it couldn't stay aloft. Supporting actress Zhao Xun (Ming Ming) has huge talent but her character of Quing is too simple and a bit one-dimensional. Ge You comes out with an outstanding performance as Emperor Li; his powerful portrayal is truly superb and note-worthy. Ultimately, while this film is loosely based on ""Hamlet"", the climax does occur in a banquet and this is a Chinese film where the old adage applies: No evil deed will go unpunished and repaid.

The Banquet is a very difficult film to judge. The film feels too mainstream for a Wuxia Epic drama and it seems geared towards international audiences and not to the people of Feng's native land. The film is definitely a part of the superficial, overindulgent popular Chinese film for viewers in the U.S. It is not a contemporary Wuxia film but rather one so polished for international acclaim (then again, I've read it was its intention). The lack of emotions and character depth never allows the film to surpass its gorgeous costumes and set designs. The film does succeed in the classic manipulations and plots of betrayal; but ultimately, the lasting impression is how beautifully shot and expensive the film is that it falls a bit short of epic grandeur. The film is better than most, it is better than Chen Kaige's ""The Promise"" but if you saw ""HERO"" and "" HOUSE of FLYING DAGGERS""; the film just cannot surpass the coldness of its exterior.

3280562,4,B00104AYGK,"The version I bought doesn't have the same cover art as this one does, but is a beautifully packaged Chinese Collector's Edition with a portrait of the fabulously beautiful actress and heroine of this story, Zhang Ziyi, as she stars in her first adult role, that of the Dowager Empress.  Some observers have suggested that this movie (La Legende de la Scorpion Noir, in my French voice-over) or BANQUET, on the cover, is based on Shakespeare's HAMLET.  That may ultimately be true.  However, though there are similarities, it need not become a distraction.

If BANQUET were a Shakespeare adaptation, it might remind one of THRONE OF BLOOD, the Japanese take on MACBETH, or RAN, Kurosawa's thrilling take on KING LEAR.  However, in that case one views the HAMLET story, through the eyes of the Prince, who detests the marriage of his mother, Queen Gertrude, to her brother-in-law and his uncle, King Claudius.  In that case, the problem is what to do with her son, the heir to the throne?

In this re-writing, before the story even begins, she Zhang Ziyi was not the prince's young mother, but his young fiancee.  No incest problem.  The death of the Emperor and the resultant confusion at court is only intensified when she agrees to marry the new Emperor (her brother-in-law) and the Prince goes into hiding in a kind of Monastary/Theatre School, specializing in poetry and dance.

The film begins, actually, as a messenger of the Court arrives to invite the prince to return to Court, only minutes before a squad of assassins sent by the Emperor arrives, to kill him.  He escapes, and makes his way back to Court and lives there under the protection of the new Empress, his former fiancee, who loves him at least as much as she loves the prestiege and power of her new position.  In this story, all the problems of the situation are hers, not the Prince's.

Eventually we learn that the former Emperor was murdered (by his brother, it seems) by means of a powdered compound made in part from the essence of a black scorpion which is blown into the victim's ear, through a feather.  That's a detail very like the murder of Hamlet's father, by a poison in liquid form poured into his ear.

Another similarity to the Hamlet story is the adoration of a young woman of the Court for the Prince.  As with Ophelia, his feelings about this innocent and loving girl are sexual, but ambiguous, and cannot be resolved.

The most striking difference between the two stories of Court intrigue is that here, there are no ghosts, and the Prince does not ever hallucinate his father.

But all these details are superficial distractions.  My advice is to abandon if you can, every reference you've heard between this film and the Shakespeare play, and simply sit back, relex and enjoy an historical drama of psychological complexity, produced with exceptional beauty and style, and played skillfully by some of the best film actors you'll ever see, in a specifically Chinese historical context, but with universal appeal.  The music is good, the sets and costumes are georgeous, and often spectacular, and if you follow the characters and their relations with one another, you will grasp and enjoy the story in its entirety.  The cultural differences between this production and any European story of similar type, are unavoidable; however the human emotions that motivate the characters are universal.  The behaviors of the characters may puzzle children and adolescents, they will not trouble adults at all.

BANQUET, or CURSE (or venom, actually) OF THE BLACK SCORPION is a piece of adult entertainment in the grand style.",1263686400,2,3610,4.862745098039215

3280567,5,B00104AYGK,"There's no point in rehashing the premise/actors/other details of this film, as other reviewers are hitting it.  I'll simply make my arguments.

I agree that this film, for all its depiction of treachery and pathos, is cold and cerebral.  I agree that the action is also depicted on a very cerebral level: it is so stylized that it is robbed of its intensity--certainly robbed of the visceral aspect that would appeal to those who are looking for an action movie.  So I certainly advise against it for those looking for a great martial arts film.  Check out ""Tai Chi Master"" or ""Fong Sai Yuk"" for that!

What is left after the emotional attachments and thrill of combat are removed?  A purely aesthetic masterpiece.  This is truly an ""art"" film: sight and sound combine in moving paintings, symbols, and stylized archetypes.

You will not be drawn in by the story and the characters.  You will be drawn in by the crystalline imagery and sound that form an alternate universe in which everything is perfect form, hypnotic motion.  Beautiful images are frozen in space and time, haunting music and movement and color supersede all other concerns.

We know Hamlet.  We know this story.  We know these characters.  Here story and character are cyphers.  In this film the source Hamlet simply functions as a framework to hang a filmed aesthetic, a transformation of the world into stylized form.  Is it enough?  Is this all that is necessary to make a great film?  Yes.  If you are sensitive to it, you will be stunned and enthralled.  If you are not, you will be bored.",1243555200,15,1565,4.722222222222222

3280571,4,B00104AYGK,"Visually stunning.  Impeccable sets, costumes and makeup and wonderfully shot.

While this movie has been labeled as ""wuxia"" and many viewers seem to have watched it ""for the fight scenes,"" it's not about the fight scenes at all (and there aren't many of them). Actually, a few of them were completely unnecessary and disrupted the flow of the movie (despite how pretty and ballet-like they are).  The director probably tacked them on to sell it as a martial arts movie and attract more audiences in the west.  So if you're watching the movie for fight scenes, you'll be disappointed.

The Banquet is an interesting mix of western and eastern elements.  While the backbone of the plot is undeniably Hamlet/Macbeth, the different parts of the overall story were definitely nothing new in Chinese history.  The only tidbit that was blatantly Shakespearean was the performance of ""Hamlet's"" play portraying his father's murder before the court.  The director did emphasize the theatrical quality of the film by employing slow, stilted, somewhat affected speech cadences.  Hence some may complain about the under-emoting, which is an effect of trying to establish ""a play within a movie.""

My gripe with the movie is that certain scenes seemed very out-of-place and contrived.  There are also moments when the characters would change moods and behavior quite suddenly.

What I thought was great about this movie (aside from the visuals) was the dialogue.  Since the emoting was toned down quite a bit, sometimes you can only glean what the characters really think from the words they are using.  The subtle insinuations and suggestions between the Empress and the new Emperor were especially delicious.  However, during some of the odd scenes mentioned above, the characters can utter some ridiculously trite sayings.

The film has a good score, and the main theme (the song that the prince brings back with him) is haunting.  The thoroughly modern end theme, however, seems a little anachronistic.

Another note about the ending (no spoilers): there's a reason why the director decided to end it the way he did.  The people who find it unsatisfying probably don't get the message he's trying to send.

Overall a truly great film.  Very beautiful and great lines.  Plus Zhang Ziyi and Ge You are spot on in their roles.  Be prepared for a long play on film.  Do not watch it if you're only interested in martial arts, but stay if you're into political intrigue and soul-twisting effects of desire.",1239321600,5,2493,5.009732360097324

The narrow range of emotions displayed doesn't involve us. The thousands of waiting minions thing was interesting, the first time. The fight scenes seem added on to try to inject some life into this sloth. A fight scene must be filmed and especially edited correctly or it will present as a bunch of unrelated blurs of action, uninvolving to us folks that crave this action. This film is maybe 50% guilty of this. Near the beginning there is a savage attack on what looks like a mime school. The mimes just strike those goofy ""mime poses"" and allow themselves to be slaughtered without resistance, it just appears dumb. There seems to be a genre in China nowadays that specializes in intimate examination of historical supremely decadent emperor's and their courts. There is always treachery and disloyalty. Always a tragic ending. Overall though, the film is well made. It is sumptuous in it's high court details. I would like the emoting/drama turned up a few notches.

3280576,4,B00104AYGK,"Feng Xiaogang's The Banquet aka The Legend of the Black Scorpion certainly lives up to its reputation as one of the most beautiful looking films ever made. A spectacular Chinese adaptation of Hamlet filmed on an epic scale with no expense spared and with all the action scenes that Shakespeare forgot to write, it's clearly aiming to be another Hero, with nods to Akira Kurosawa's Japanese samurai Shakespeare films along the way. Although it never quite hits the same highs, it works surprisingly well, with Daniel Wu's Crown Prince brooding over his father's murder by his uncle while his former beloved Ziyi Zhang is consumed by revenge in her desire to kill the new emperor as courtiers plot and intrigue around them. With superb art direction by Tim Yip, excellent cinematography by Li Zhang, striking fight sequences courtesy of Yuen Wo-Ping at his best and a fine score by Tan Dun (Andrew Lloyd Webberish end title song notwithstanding) and filled with colour, light and movement, it's always a treat for the eyes and ears, especially in this  2.35:1 widescreen transfer.",1219536000,5,1078,4.988888888888889

8236930,5,B00104AYGK,"Having no insight about the movie, I watched with an open mind.  About one third of the way through it struck me that this was very much Hamlet-like, exceptionally well acted and magnificently set. And so it was.  What an amazing experience.  The ballet-like martial arts movements, costumes and total immersion into the story provided an unexpected fusion of plot, visual impact and emotion.  The subtitles were not an impediment to the experience.  Highly recommended.",1519689600,,470,5.213333333333333

8236932,4,B00104AYGK,"Not really impressive with the martial arts but the fight scenes are artfully done similar to House of Flying Daggers and Hero. Ziyi Zhang is one of my favorite actresses right now. She is absolutely amazing if she wasn't in it I probably wouldn't add it to my Martial Arts collection, because she is the one that keeps me engaged during the slower parts of this movie",1517616000,,368,4.507462686567164
