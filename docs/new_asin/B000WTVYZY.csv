FYI in this whole process of healing my back I found along with these poses, sleeping on the floor on two extra cushiony  thick yoga mats have helped my back enorrrmously! Amazon basics has an extra thick yoga mat I bought and I layer 2 of those (I bought two wxtra cushony yoga mats) and later them ontop of my normal thin yoga mat. Give it a try! You can use doubled up hand towels rolled up under your neck for sleeping on your back as well as a yoga zafu meditation cushion for sleeping on your side and a folded up bath towel covered in a pillow case or tshirt as a pillow for sleeping on your stomach ear faced down. Rodneys poses plus sleeping on the floor helped me so much! Thought Id share!",1521072000,,759,4.198630136986301

8225640,5,B000WTVYZY,"I have been suffering from lower back pain for some time because of my scoliosis. And it was getting worse. My lower back pain was waking me up every morning and my back was increasingly hurting during the day too. Last November, I found this DVD in our public library and checked it out. It was sitting on my bookshelf for two weeks before I reluctantly put it into our DVD player. I was very skeptical but my lower back hurt me since morning on that particular day and I did not know how to get rid of it. I exercised the gentle yoga program with Rodney Yee. After this 30 minute exercise, I felt an instant relief in my lower back pain. I could not believe it. I was instantly hooked and started to exercise this program every day. I bought the DVD and also got other DVDs with Rodney Yee and one with Ann Carpenter. I continue to exercise yoga almost every day and my lower back pain is completely gone. This DVD has been perhaps the best investment of my life because my back does not hurt me anymore.",1406246400,,1006,4.244791666666667
8225641,5,B000WTVYZY,"I suffer from chronic back pain due to scoliosis of the lumbar spine. I liked the information provided on this DVD, it helped me understand where my pain comes from and gave me the mental attitude I needed to deal with this back of mine. I enjoy the Yoga for lower back included here and I became a fan of Yoga after doing this. Now, I'm looking forward on learning more about Yoga because I know for sure, it helps relieve my pain!",1279411200,,432,4.216867469879518
8225642,1,B000WTVYZY,"There is significant repeat of the same matter.

There is too much time wasted in showing the personilities of Mayo clinic

Less material on back problem and more general nutrition and genral material is given importance

The contents does not look like from Mayo clinic --should have been better selection of contents

Along with back exercise some other yoga activities should have been shown like yoga for other parts of body  more important than genral discussion
