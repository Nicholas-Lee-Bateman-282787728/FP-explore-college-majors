The slow start is all part of the plan so that when things start moving they can move quickly and we'll know the characters. If you aren't ready to see a movie that you could have easily bankrolled than yes skip it but if you want something that works on EVERY level and has several moments of real intensity watch this TONIGHT. I loved the little trick from NXNW and so much more. I only have one caveat, the ending is kind of abrupt, but the more I think about it the more it to works for me.",1314230400,7,575,4.008695652173913

Help!

First, whenever you seen multiple prolonged shots (i.e. something on the order of 30 seconds for each of many) of basically nothing (e.g. freeway, Portland skyline, clouds, more clouds, trees, unmown street side vegetation, ice making and ice bag stacking, street driving, apartment chats) then you've filled 90% of the movie and you're left wondering when is something going to happen.

Second, when an ex-girlfriend disappears which was bizarre in itself and the supposedly intelligent ex-student/ex-boyfriend misses a bunch of obvious clues while also being able to solve some that make no sense unless he was told the answers by the script director or had Houdini like clairvoyance you are going - huh! Or, the near ending scene where the soon to be victim is in a restaurant with an important briefcase inches from him and some girl walks up to the briefcase, grabs it and runs out the door, tosses it to another person, then runs around the car, gets in and drives a half block before said victim makes it out the door is like - sure, whatever!

Third, an obvious give-away to poor directing/writing is when the victim's car is being followed about a block or two behind (mostly no other cars around) and for multiple turns over miles and that person is clueless about being followed?? Even more surprising is when it happens more than once.

Fourth, the ending was like having bought one big firework for The Fourth and it doesn't go off. And, the alternate ending is even worse with just more prolonged shots of clouds, a waterfall, a creek, a tree branch.

Maybe this movie was made for really bright Nietzsche and Sartr Nihilists and Existentialists to appreciate.  I guess it's time to start my brain exercise reading.",1313193600,2,1859,4.848580441640379

4521441,1,B0051CSIK6,"Every so often, I get the feeling that certain (often highly respected) critics are either involved in slipping us a mickey, or have gone bonkers.
Take this film... please!
Critics RAVED about it!
ROGER EBERT called it virtually ""perfect"".
He is soooooooooooooooooo wrong!
Here's the film:
For the first 40 minutes we watch four incredibly boring young people do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! (Well, unless you consider stacking bags of ice ""something"")
Then one of them gets in some trouble and (although WE never get to see it) leaves some kind of cryptic clue about it that the others soon figure out, even though there is no good reason why the person in trouble couldn't, simply, have TOLD the others!
Anyway.
The other three solve the problem by, basically, doing nothing more than (SPOILER ALERT) running into a restaurant, stealing a ""package"" and running away.
They ARE NOT CHASED! They are NOT CAUGHT! They are in ABSOLUTELY NO DANGER WHATSOEVER!
And so, the film stops.
It doesn't END (How could it? It never began!) It stops!

At least after that, you have dry paint!",1312934400,5,1164,4.825
4521442,3,B0051CSIK6,This film had some interest in being different but was spoiled  with an overlong beginning and an abrupt ending - the director seemed to begin under the influence of Cimino and then run out of money.,1380499200,,199,4.527777777777778
4521443,2,B0051CSIK6,"Skip the first 35 minutes. It just portrays an empty protagonist with a criminal justice degree and no interest in criminal justice. He takes a job at a ice factory, makes a friend, but mostly hangs out with his sister. The ""mystery"" starts once we get the gist of how small and insignificant the lives of all the characters are. I've been to Portland, Oregon a few times and I always leave in a somber mood, like I just heard that a friend from my childhood died suddenly but I haven't seen him in 20 years. It's always chilly, rainy, and, while the citizens seem eclectic enough, they are just wandering around in a purgatory of unemployment with neo-folk music as the soundtrack. The scenery is beautiful but it's always damp and always cloudy. You wait for that sunny day that will dry out the clouds and lighten the shadows but, like this movie, it never comes.

4521444,3,B0051CSIK6,"SPOILERS:

I can appreciate art house (low budget movies).  Special effects traded for character development, multiple locations traded for quirkiness, dialog and wit, etc.  I had high hopes for Cold Weather after seeing the Rotten Tomatoes review and reading the synopsis on Wiki.  Unfortunately, it fell flat on many levels

Brother comes home to Portland from Chicago taking a hiatus from school and moving in with his sister.  Brother takes a job working the night shift at an Ice House.  Brother meets Carlos at the Ice House who is also a part time DJ.  Brother's ex-girlfriend from Chicago comes to Portland seemingly for job training since taking a job as a Paralegal in Chicago with a law firm headquartered in Portland.

In concert with the synopsis above:

Brother and sister are both seemingly without many friends and seem to be almost morose.  Without giving away too much of the plot, the ex-girlfriend disappears and is apparently not a Paralegal.

What I didn't like:

1.) The humor is all deadpan and while this would not normally be a problem for me, I just didn't find it all that amusing

2.) There is no back-story re: why the ex is in fact an ex?

3.) While I found the brother's connection to Sherlock Holmes interesting, it was not developed enough

4.) There are long pauses which didn't seem to go anywhere

In summary, I thought that the outline was great, though there was simply not enough done with it.  I didn't find the mystery aspect all that interesting, the dialogue was not overly witty or profound and the character relationships were not explored with enough depth.  I got the sense that the brother/sister relationship was near oedipal in nature (I.E. he made her mixed tapes in HS and she was uncomfortable talking about dating) and this could have been explored further.

To reiterate, I can appreciate a character or dialogue driven Indy/Art House movie (I.E. Swingers, Clerks, Open Water, Supersize Me, etc.).  However, this just didn't work for me, so perhaps I would file it under YMMV.",1358812800,,2032,4.831884057971014
4521445,4,B0051CSIK6,"I don't remember a movie showing in such a subtle way how one thinks and acts when one is an adult without having yet the maturity of an adult. On that point of view, the movie is remarkable.
The main characters are one young man, Doug, and his sister who live together in Portland. Doug has started studying forensics but works for now in an ice factory. We meet one of his co-workers who is a part-time DJ and Rachel, an old girlfriend of Doug.
The girlfriend gets into some trouble we know nothing about and disappears. It is a misdirection. One expect that she will be murdered and that Doug will use his freshly acquired forensic talents to discover the murderer, all this under the dark grey skies of Portland. But it is not the story at all. Doug has very little talent of observation and no forensic talent at all. It makes sense as he probably has learned from textbooks and has no practical experience, so he would not consider calling the police or wear gloves to protect the evidence.
The first thing he does is to buy a pipe to be like Sherlock Holmes ""because it is going to help him think"". That scene won me over. So 20 minutes into the film, I finally got what it was about: it is about this uncertain age...
So the mystery takes an unexpected direction; it is solved just like young people would solve it.
The movie has charm and is hard to forget. It suffers from very poor editing. I do not mind a slow movie at all, if the characters are interesting, but here the rhythms are all wrong: it starts too slow and ends too fast. I feel that the photography is not quite in tune with the intention and should be more intimate.
Maybe the next movie by the same people will be a great classic. Watch it!",1357603200,,1717,4.318885448916409
4521446,5,B0051CSIK6,"If you are an adventurous film watcher, this is a wonderfully rewarding gem.  Quirky, unexpected and delicious.  My one word review would be ""Charming!""",1347148800,3,152,5.291666666666667
4521447,5,B0051CSIK6,Totally original.  It is minimal but very clever.  It takes its time & doesn't over explain but is worth the effort.,1342656000,2,116,4.476190476190476
4521448,1,B0051CSIK6,"Watching this movie felt as if I was watching a 3-legged tortoise trying to win a 100-meter dash. It's a slow, boring experience. But I kept watching this flick because I felt sorry for this turtle of a movie. I wanted to like it. It seemed like an honest effort straight from the heart. But it was just too slow.

Acting: dull and lifeless. When the characters have their plodding dialogue, it's believable. When the characters are trying to show anger or fear, it is amateurish.

Camera-work: shaky-cam. When the characters are running, the cameraman is running behind them. As a result, the shaky-cam gets really bad. There's even shaky-cam when the characters are sitting down on a bed. Why?

Music: reminded me of Mark Mothersbaugh's music in Wes Anderson's Rushmore. In fact, I'm sure this movie was really influenced by Rushmore. Except this movie wasn't trying to be humorous. If it had been a comedy, I might have been able to forgive all the weak dialogue.

Pacing: This movie was extremely slow. Why do we need boring shots of library shelves? Why do I need two minute shots of characters eating on a bench 50 yards away? Why do I need shots of lamp posts? How many scenes do we need where the character does nothing but sleep? How many shots of Portland, Oregon though a soggy windshield do we need to see?

Although this movie isn't as aggravatingly tedious as Vincent Gallo's the Brown Bunny, the pace of this movie was idiotically slow. I am dead serious when I say this: you could actually skip the first 35 minutes of this movie and miss nothing. Seriously. If you watch this movie, skip to the 35 minute mark. In fact, this movie should have been a 30-40 minute short. It would have been much better that way. Nothing happens before 35 minutes. There isn't any character establishment whatsoever. The characters in this movie were lifeless. They had no motivation, no ambition, no drive, and no direction. As a result, the audience didn't have any reason to care about them. What a waste.

P.S. I don't give a crap whether you like this movie or not, you have to admit the ending was a big letdown. Even though I was happy this slow movie finally ended, I had to say, ""That's all? You're gonna end it like that? Really?"" It seems like the director got bored with the movie in the end and just turned off the camera. Either that or he ran out of batteries, couldn't get enough money to buy new batteries, and said, ""Screw it. I'm just gonna show it off with that pointless ending. I'm sure by that time most people will be too bored to care.""",1341792000,,2559,4.540130151843818
4521449,1,B0051CSIK6,"I completely agree with the other negative reviews on this film.  Having said that, I might have gone along with and maybe even have given allowances for the film if if wasn't that the main male character in the movie was so unlikeable.  He was self-centered, selfish, and annoying to say the least; in just one example, in one scene, he surprises and interrups his sister at work to go whale-watching and he will not take no for an answer. This for something so trivial, Yet, when his friend shows up at his door with the suspicion that the main male character's ex-girlfriend may be missing and the victim of possible foul play, he cannot be bothered and ,indeed, is agitated to the point of being indignant about having been woke up. All in all, I did not want to spend one minute with the guy, let alone 96.",1327104000,2,811,4.436241610738255
4521450,4,B0051CSIK6,"A slacker mystery about finding identity. Very natural performances create real, likable people rather than the usual movie caricatures.

4521451,3,B0051CSIK6,"I wanted so much to like this film. Mostly because it takes place in Portland, a city in which I have a great affection and affinity towards. It also looked like a promising detective film filled with mystery and intrigue. ""Cold Weather"" just failed to deliver the goods. The story follows Doug, a directionless 20 something who moves in with his sister. Doug has chosen to abandon his dreams of being a detective and elects to work in an ice packing factory until he ""figures things out"".
  Later on, his ex girlfriend comes to visit him and they have a pleasant time catching up. Things soon take a troubling turn when she fails to turn up for friend's Dj gig. Doug springs into action and uses her disappearance as a chance to use what he learned in forensic science class to find her. ""Cold Weather"" had a great opportunity to be a solid mystery movie but quickly became unfocused. Doug's forensic skills are barely displayed and the characters spend most of their time sitting in cars eating Swedish Fish. These long and pointless scenes could of been better utilized to create more depth to the plot but where instead wasted.
  I won't give anything away but the reason behind the disappearance was pretty lame and a tinny bit confusing. I spend most of my time being impatient and when all was said and done I asked myself ""..is that it?"" ""Cold Weather"" isn't a horrible movie by any means, and it worked for me on some level, but it seemed ultimately pointless. Watch it for some beautiful scenes of Portland and some mildly amusing banter, otherwise give ""Cold Weather"" the cold shoulder.",1323043200,3,1597,4.652482269503546
8452551,3,B0051CSIK6,Started out quirky and with an indy feel.  I thought it was going to be a dark comedy.  It tries to be but the plot is weak and there is no payoff at the end.  The main make character was a cutie though so there's that.,1512691200,,219,3.717391304347826
8452552,2,B0051CSIK6,"The only reason this gets two stars is that it's a fledgling attempt, and the dialogue wasn't too bad.

However, a BIG disagreement with viewers who think the ending was ok.

The whole premise of the movie depended on the search for clues, in the style of Sherlock Holmes, Agatha Christie, etc. They even made a big point of the kid getting a Sherlock Holmes style pipe.

When that premise is chosen, you don't put the audience through all the running around, and not have the puzzle all put together at the end. This style of writing depends on cleverness.

Indie filmmakers need to know leaving a script hanging is not okay.

The jig is up!  We've figured it out.  It's not arty.  You're just lazy.

8452559,3,B0051CSIK6,"I was browsing the movie section of my local library the other day in search of an interesting movie, and fell upon this. Given the `polar vortex' that we have gone through recently, how appropriate it would be to watch a movie called ""Cold Weather""!

""Cold Weather"" (2010 release; 96 min.) brings the story of Doug (played by Cris Lankenau) and Gail (played by Trieste Kelly Dunn). As the movie opens, we see them having dinner with what turns out to be their parents. Indeed Doug and Gail are brother and sister, with Doug having moved in recently with her in Portland, OR. He has stopped his CSI-like forensic studies, and eventually takes a job at an ice factory. There, Doug becomes friends with a co-worker named Carlos. And Doug also runs into Rachel, an ex-girlfriend who has come for Chicago for work purposes. The four of them all get along great, and Carlos even develops a crush on Rachel. Then late one evening, a distraught Carlos comes to Doug's apartment, telling him Rachel didn't show up for a date. Doug now can use his limited experience in forensics to help his friend, and believes himself to be the next Sherlock Holmes. What has happened to Rachel? At this point we a good 30-35 min. into the movie, and to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience.

Couple of comments: first, this movie must be a labor of love from writer-director-editor and co-producer Aaron Katz. The movie is made on a shoestring basis, if that much. But it doesn't stop Katz from setting us up with a decent mystery-thriller. Second, the movie is set in Portland, and the Portland scenery plays as much a character in the movie as any of the lead stars. Third, the movie plays out nicely, that is until the very end, which came abrupt and left me scratching my head, to be honest. Fourth, there are some interesting DVD bonus materials. I immediately checked out the ""Alternative Ending"", but that didn't do much more for me either. Far better is the live performance (taped in Nashville) of the movie soundtrack's End Titles by the composer and an ensemble of about 10 live performers.

Bottom line: this is a bare-bones, indie mystery-thriller that plays out well for the most part, even if the ending doesn't really deliver. ""Cold Weather"" is worth checking out as a rental from your local library or if you can borrow it for an evening from a friend.",1391385600,,2360,4.654676258992806
8452560,4,B0051CSIK6,Really good suspense movie with cute indie overtones.

Definitley enjoyable.,1389312000,,416,4.5675675675675675
