In fact, my mom loved it so much that she borrowed it from me. Craig does interrupt between songs to say what page of the book he is on and what song it is, but it is such a great video. I'm not sure how it will do in aiding in my fiddle playing, but I'm glad I bought it; and oh yeah, so is my mom!!!",1359936000,,507,3.6605504587155964
