I wholeheartedly support independent cinema, but there should be certain lines drawn, and this should have been kept in the can as a reference point of early work.

We follow the events in several people's intersecting lives as each hopes to find love but finds rejection instead. Hand held cameras follow these characters as one might see in a home movie. The sound is intermittent, the acting is improv with lengthy takes and repetitive dialogue. The production did not worry about the barrier being broken as mic pacs are visible on belts throughout, the ""epiphany"" videos seen at the end by the ladies could not exist unless the ""second"" camerman is acknowledged and the improv lines counter whatever continuity there was from the beginning of the film. Plus, our main character is a double stalker (follows both his love interest and the other guy on his own) so you really could care less about anyone in this film.

It lasts 68 minutes, there are no special features, and with this being nine years old it could have done much better being released as a supplement with one of his later movies. As a side note, I did the research on each of the quotes put on the cover art, and they edited down each one and did not put the entire rating from Metacritic (gave it a 8.4 from the same 5 people inflating it on each website - when it really should use the 18 score since most others tanked this as a dud). Gave it another star for being in the Guinness Book.",1247961600,,1619,4.598615916955017
8349924,4,B0023S4AUS,"I have to admit my bias up front. I have known director Young Man Kang for 16 years. It is amazing that he could make any kind of feature for a thousand dollars, let alone one that engages the audience. Again, maybe it's my bias because I generally don't like action films and that is what Kang usually makes - for considerably more money than he had to make Cupid's Mistake - but this is his best in my humble opinion. I got into the story and cared about the characters and stopped thinking about how little was spent to make the film. In case you are wondering how I can be reviewing a movie that does not come out on DVD for almost another three months, I will note that it used to be available to watch online many years ago. If you like indie film and want to see what can be done with truly very little money then watch Cupid's Mistake. Neither the production nor the acting is brilliant, but the fact that it exists and keeps you watching is a miracle. When will you do another romance, Young Man?",1241049600,,1005,4.212435233160622
