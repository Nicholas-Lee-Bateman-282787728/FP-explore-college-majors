8398866,5,B003KPMNBQ,I bought this video for my son who is a delayed talker. He loves this video and requests to watch it.... Even over his favorite cartoons! It has helped him with talking as well!,1427414400,,177,4.235294117647059
8398867,3,B003KPMNBQ,"First impression: I wish the description said the voices have a thick English, as in Brit, accent! I wonder if my American children will be asking to eat porridge for breakfast and then go to the bloody park in their trousers or knickers. The names Sookie and Finn are spoken like ""Sucky and Phil."" I give it 3 stars because in 15 miserable minutes my child was glued to it and already could say ""milk"" and ""rain"" with an entertaining English accent. All should be well, especially after he learns to call his mother Mummy. Jolly-oh!",1417651200,,533,4.5625
8398868,5,B003KPMNBQ,This is a fantastic DVD and brilliantly made and I would highly recommend it for any parents whose child had been diagnosed with an  expressive and/ or receptive language delay. Since I purchased this DVD my child has come on so much and he really enjoys the DVD. Cannot recommend it enough.,1400457600,,291,4.596153846153846
8398869,5,B003KPMNBQ,Great DVD for toddlers with speech delay. My toddler enjoys the DVD and the songs. Some of the other DVDs to help with speech he didn't like/was scared of the characters and they just repeated single words. This one repeats words and phrases.,1400284800,,242,4.651162790697675
8398870,3,B003KPMNBQ,Too much accent for young American child.  It did not hold his attention as other films for young children have done.,1378252800,,117,4.571428571428571
8398871,4,B003KPMNBQ,"This video is very different from the Baby Babble DVD series.  Baby Babble DVDs emphasized lip movement, consonant/vowel sounds, etc.)  Whereas, this dvd is about two children (cartoons) that run through their routine for the day.  Sookie and Finn each identify objects around them and explain what their doing (i.e., ""I am eating breakfast.""  ""There is toast and there is porridge"".  ""I am hungry"".  ""Finn is eating porridge"".)  In between the scenes of the routines (waking up, getting dressed, eating, playing, etc.), Sookie and Finn sing songs (Row, row, row your boat, I'm a little teapot, etc.).  This DVD is a reminder to parents to talk to your kids and point out different things while using simple sentences.  There is also a narrator that goes over what Sooki and Finn is doing.  She repeats the words that Sookie and Finn use.  Hope this helps out parents deciding if this is right for thier child.  Personally, my family found the Baby Babble series more helpful when it comes to addressing speech delays, but this was a nice secondary DVD to play.  The biggest reason why we preferred Baby Babble....it's hard for kids to follow speech patterns because you can't see the mouth movement in a cartoon.",1331683200,6,1213,4.8585365853658535
8398872,5,B003KPMNBQ,"This DVD was the first time my daughter (just over 2) actually understood what was going on in a story and it fascinated her. She understood a few of the basic words in My Day and the pictures looked familiar and she obviously loved that comprehension. Her speech is slow, but she has now started trying to copy the words and gets upset when the DVD has finished. No other book, programme, cartoon has helped her or entertained her this much.",1329436800,,442,4.469135802469136
8398873,5,B003KPMNBQ,"We bought this DVD for our 2.5 yr old and he loves it. We have already seen a huge difference in his language skills, his inunciation  has improved and the social skills they teach in the DVD are having a positive impression on him. It's a wonderful addition to add to all the educational videos.",1328918400,,296,4.381818181818182
8398874,5,B003KPMNBQ,"I bought this DVD for my 21 month old twins (boy and girl).  My son was born with bi-lateral cleft lip and palate which has recently been repaired,  My daughter has no physical issues.  Our intent was to jump start the speech therapy my son will be recieving shortly and my daughter could also benefit by improving her vocabulary.  We have this DVD for less than a week now and I am very happy with this purchase.

My twins love this video so much in the first few days they were turning on the DVD player themselves to see it.  They walk right up to the screen and seem to be interacting with the TV.  The first day my son said two new words and sounds he was unable to say before.  My twins were also emulating the play they saw in the video and started kicking a ball back and forth to one another.

The DVD uses events in a typical child's day and first presents the animation, then a follow up with an adult reviewing the words and concepts.  The nursery rhymes are great also and can be played by themselves.

This video was well worth the purchase price for just the enjoyment the kids get out of it and will pay for itelf again if they master the concepts it teaches (and they are on their way to doing so).

Update August 2012:  My twins love this video still.  We have purchased the follow up videos ""Going to School"" and ""At school"" when they came out in preparation for Nursery school.  These were not available at the time of my initial review.  My son does not have a speech delay anymore but this video in particular is a favorite and helps them emmulate the tasks they need to do in a day like brushing teeth and hair.  We also have the Baby Babble series and found that slightly more helpful for speech but would not have done without this video.",1320883200,,1763,4.246246246246246
8398875,5,B003KPMNBQ,"This is an excellent DVD. I bought this for my 2 year old son who is taking his time to speak. My son loves watching the DVD every evening before bed time. We don't let him watch much TV but I make an exception for programs that have educational value and Sookie & Finn is one of those. Since starting with this DVD, my son has been repeating some of the words in the DVD as well as started trying to sing the songs :) This is a well thought out DVD, it is fun and works. I especially like the fact that the dialogues are simple and clear, there is lots of repetition. The summary at the end is also very useful. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to boost their kid's speech. I wish there was another one.",1305676800,4,712,4.02112676056338
