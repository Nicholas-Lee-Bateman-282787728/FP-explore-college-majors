I know the problem is not the DVD recording but the quality of the source which is very old and without the current quality standards.
However I don't recommend buying this product because it will be a frustrating purchase for any Melchior's fan.",1504051200,,314,4.7272727272727275

8552643,5,B00AJER4J2,"Melchior's brilliant singing, bon vivant attitude, and jovial presence are expertly exhibited by this collection of his performances for the Firestone corporation.  Got it for the singing and for the singing it was terrific.",1390780800,3,224,5.588235294117647
8552644,5,B00AJER4J2,"As a longtime (55 yrs!) admirer of Lauritz Melchior, I couldn't let a 1-star review that denigrated the ""lighter"" side of his legacy go unresponded to. I haven't seen this DVD but have long owned & enjoyed the 2 VHS ""volumes"" that are here combined on it. Yes, the greatest of all Heldentenors is not presented here in his magnificent vocal prime (though in his 60s he could still outsing all of his Heldentenor successors) nor in the Wagnerian repertoire in which he was preeminent. But being able to watch & hear Melchior, regardless of the repertoire, is always a pleasure, especially as his own real pleasure in singing this mostly ""pop"" material is so apparent.

I had the pleasure & privilege of meeting & hearing  Melchior twice in person. In 1959, when I was 19, I wrote a fan letter to him & wound up being invited to be his guest at a performance in Brooklyn a few months later. I have an immense collection of his recordings, operatic, classical, semi-classical & pop, including his early recordings as a baritone & all of his complete Wagner opera performances that were captured from broadcasts, as well as all his commercially-recorded Wagnerian scenes & arias. A signed photo of Melchior as Lohengrin, which he gave to me, hangs on the wall over my record collection. I also own VHSs of all 5 Hollywood feature films in which he appeared, singing a mix of operatic arias, semiclassical & pop songs. As with the material on this DVD, Melchior never failed to bring his talent & enthusiasm to whatever he sang.

For all those unfamiliar with this great singer, as well as for those who know Melchior only from his operatic recordings, I can't recommend this DVD too highly.",1367280000,7,1686,4.6891891891891895
8552645,5,B00AJER4J2,Lauritz Melchior was the greatest Wagnerian tenor in recording history whose massive yet richly produced tenor fully met the demands of Wagner's music. These 2 videos capture him on live television showing not only the voice but also his delightful personality. Highly recommended. This DVD transfer the two previously-available VHS tapes to DVD.,1367020800,3,346,5.547169811320755
