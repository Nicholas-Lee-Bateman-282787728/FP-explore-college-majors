Since I own all three DVD box sets, all you are getting is a retread with no extras to speak of.

All three are good Filmation productions from the 70's and the 80's. However, it just seemed like BCI just took a disk from each show and slap tashed into a collection

There are no extras in this. It is just good shows, but BCI when you do collections like this and there are a few upcoming from them..Just throw an extra something into the mix to make this special...otherwise it is a waste of my money paying for something I already have
