328542,4,6301229398,Chuck Norris has always been a favorite actor of mine and any movie he stars in is good for me...I've seen this movie many years ago and I couldn't wait to buy it on DVD...,1128816000,4,172,3.942857142857143
328543,4,6301229398,"Chuck's after a nasty serial killer again!  It's the mute villian from Superman 3 playing a mute villian again!  Is this actor really mute or just have cruddy delivery of his lines?  You get to see Chuck's sensitive side, get to see him beat up a few bad guys(the movie wouldn't feel complete without that!), and get to see him lie to the press!  This one also has Superfly as the mayor, and the muscular black dude from American Ninja!(I wish he had more screen time)  The serial killer's name is Simon Moon, and he's not the kind of serial killer that outsmarts and plays with cops.  He's actually kind of a moron, but watch out coz he'll break your neck, boy!  Doesn't it seem like most famous movie stars have to do at least one movie involving the pursuit of a serial killer?  All of this and more in Hero and the Terror!  Invite the guys over for a weenie roast and beer and check this one out.",1047168000,11,900,4.27810650887574
328544,5,6301229398,"""Hero and the Terror"" is a 'face your fear' movie. But, then it's Chuck Norris vs. A Big, Ugly Weirdo. Guess who wins? It's hilarity to the extreme how Chuckage picks up the 1000 pound beast and throws him down a theater roof. Heavy load came crashing down onto a theater seat, ouch! Yes! Pure genius.",1043971200,2,301,4.392857142857143
328545,3,6301229398,"""Hero"" Chuck Norris plays a police officer named Danny O'Brian who is haunted by his past run in with serial killer Simon Moon (The Terror).  (...).  There is a side story involving O'Brian's relationship with his ex-therapist.  This tends to slow the movie in spots.  As Chuck Norris fans we want to keep the action pace high.  Hero and the Terror is one of my favorite Chuck Norris movies though it has less martial arts and more suspense and story than you may expect from one of his movies.  The quality of the DVD is very good.  It contains both the widescreen and standard screen format with virtually no extras.  That's OK considering the budget price of this MGM release.  Hero and the Terror is an essential addition to a Chuck Norris movie library.  Recommended viewing.",1041811200,14,780,4.669117647058823
328546,4,6301229398,"Chuck Norris plays Danny O'Brien, a police officer emotionally troubled by his run in with a fierce hulk of a psychopath named Simon Moon (played by Jack - Superman 2 - Halloran).  When Moon escapes from a mental institution O'Brien must again face his deepest terror.  Norris, as always, makes for a likable hero and director William Tannen pulls off some nice suspense sequences.  This is arguably the best movie Norris made for the Cannon Group and is an essential in any fan's Chuck Norris collection.",1015891200,4,505,4.848837209302325

Chuck Norris (HERO) has to chase down a Jason type killer (THE  TERROR) before he goes on a killing spree. Hero And The Terror diserves  more credit than it gets, but it still isn't a great film by any means.",965779200,7,369,4.630769230769231

Now that I'm older and realize what REAL movies are and what REAL context in a movie is... the plot in this is dumb.

328780,4,6301229398,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""Hero and the Terror"" starring Chuck Norris. I found it in the five-dollar bin at a nearby Wal-Mart. I've seen a couple Chuck Norris movies in the past and I enjoyed them. This one was acceptable, but didn't mark up to the others. Well, perhaps this action hero needed a bit of a rest.

The movie had Norris experiencing some really bad recurring dreams as an aftermath of a near-death experience with a mad man. He was being treated by a shrink, and she was his wife. How's that for a twist? And his wife was well along in a pregnancy. Complicated enough? Well, the mad man returned and deaths and mysterious disappearings began to be associated with a newly renovated civic theater that was about to be reopened. It seems the mad man was possibly living in the catacombs of the theater and it became to task of Norris to flush him out and apprehend him. It was a difficult and complicated task, but our hero was ultimately up to it.

The story is not particularly compelling. There's a lot of action and gunfire and mayhem. Well, what might you expect in a Chuck Norris movie? Actually, one of the better side stories in the movie was the pregnancy of his beautiful wife. Go figure. In a Chuck Norris movie? Well, it wasn't a bad movie. I'd rate it about 3 1/2, but I have no way of giving that so I'll raise it to four stars.

Danny O'Brien is a detective who the press call the ""Hero"" after he captures a serial killer called Simon Moon a.k.a ""The Terror"".You guessed it ""The Terror"" escapes from jail , holes up in a movie theatre and starts his murderous ways again. Only Chuck can save the day and take on ""The Terror"" and win. A easy to watch film and good if you want to kill a hour and a half but I found Silent Rage a better film , still Chuck is Chuck and I have most of his films apart from Top Dog which I found really bad.",1268092800,,669,3.926470588235294

328784,2,6301229398,"I rented this movie years ago and had some kind of nostalgic memory of how good it was. I finally bought it but was disappointed. There isn't that much action, though I still like the fight scene at the end. Its kind of awwsome how Norris keeps pounding on ""the terror"" but he keeps coming after him. I guess you could say there is some good character development in the character Norris plays.",1215043200,,394,4.410958904109589
328785,2,6301229398,"I normally like action movies, but this one... Danny O'Brien (Chuck Norris) was nicknamed ""Hero"" when he stopped serial killer Simon Moon, who ended up in a psychiatric facility. Afterwards, he spent some time with a therapist (Brynn Thayer) dealing with the nightmares, and he's now living with her, and they're expecting a child.

Simon Moon escapes the hospital and makes his getaway in an ambulance, which he crashes. Everyone wants to think he's dead, but when a woman disappears from a newly renovated theater, O'Brien knows Moon is back, but nobody takes him seriously.

Thing is, this could have been a decent movie, but instead, it's just dull. We're supposed to feel for Danny and Kay, and the ""heartwarming"" ending, but we never got to know them beyond Danny's nightmares and discovering that Kay had been his therapist, and that she's reluctant to marry him, but considers the relationship permanent. There's a scene in a restaurant on her birthday that I think was supposed to make us sympathetic, but she ends up looking stupid, and he's so laid-back, he's nearly comatose.

I'm not sure what the point of their relationship was in the film--him trying to have a normal life, maybe, but we never see him not having the normal life, and that normal life is never threatened. If Simon Moon had captured or threatened Kay, there might have been a point.

And what's the point of making her a therapist? She's a pretty bad one--his nightmares come back, and she just says it doesn't matter because she'd already cured him. Huh? And she's seriously out of touch with her own emotions, not even aware that pregnancy heightens them. And the biggie: a romantic relationship with a patient? Not a good thing.

As for the action plot--Simon Moon was a 2-dimensional villain. There's no reason for his actions, beyond ""he's evil."" O'Brien knows immediately whodunit, so there's no mystery or suspense there. He also decides, without any investigating, that Simon Moon is hiding in the theater. There is a search for him, but it's long and nothing at all happens.

Maybe my biggest problem was that there was very little action to distract me from the dullness of the plot.",1214611200,2,2175,4.849056603773585
328786,3,6301229398,"Hero And The Terror is a decent Chuck Norris movie. Many of his better films involved him being a cop, such as An Eye For An Eye and Code of Silence. This film is not as good as either one of those films, but it is still a fairly entertaining film.

Norris plays an LA cop who must go after a notorious serial killer after the killer ecapes from jail. Norris' life is already complicated because his fiance is pressuring him to marry her.

The climax in a old movie theater is good and entertaining, but the rest of the movie is only so-so. Hero and The Terror is not Norris' best, but it's not his worst, either.",1163808000,2,613,4.186440677966102
