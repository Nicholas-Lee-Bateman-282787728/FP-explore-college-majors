8617217,4,B00FNPQW7W,"""The Graduates Los Graduatos"" (2013 release; 120 min.) looks into the reasons as to why 1 in 3 Latinos do not graduate from high school in a timely fashion, and even more importantly, why that matters to the rest of us. The documentary consists of two parts. The first part focuses on the girls, and we get to know Darlene in Tulsa (and being a young mother), Stephanie in Chicago (living in a dangerous neighborhood), and Chastity in the Bronx (and at times in a homeless shelter). The second part focuses on the boys and we get to know Eduardo in San Diego (and dealing with gang violence), Gustavo in Griffin, GA (and being an illegal alien), and Juan in Lawrence, MA (and being gay).

The documentary gives great insight on the challenges that Latinos meet. While the circumstances are of course not exactly the same for the girls as they are for the boys, there are a couple of clear common threads that come back time and again: in most public schools the level of expectations for these kids is low, and hence not much is expected of them (or given to them). By having higher expectations, the level of performance is certain to go up. And why should all of us care about how Latinos are faring in high school and subsequently in college? Because they are the fastest growing segment of the population and their low performance in education is going to hurt America's competitiveness in the world over the long run.

This is an important documentary. It was first shown on PBS last Fall, but now widely available on DVD. This should be required viewing in many schools, and frankly not just by students but also by faculty and administration. Let's set high expectations, and let's give the necessary guidance and tools to Latino high school kids (and everyone else too, of course). They want to succeed. We NEED them to succeed. ""The Graduates Los Graduatos"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1394928000,,1889,4.66966966966967
8617218,5,B00FNPQW7W,The Graduates is a deeply moving and pertinent documentary.  Although there are some talking heads (and their perspective is valuable) Ruiz allows the young people to speak for themselves. I couldn't give this movie a higher recommendation.,1389744000,,240,5.486486486486487
8617219,3,B00FNPQW7W,"The program examines the lives of six Latinos (three female, three male) who pursue educations.  The interviewees are of diverse ethnicities and from diverse states.  One student has a baby.  Another has a gang past.  One would like to attend college, but his undocumented status challenges that.  One student is gay.  Another one is homeless.  The show disperses interviews from famous Latino politicians, authors, and activists.  This may be done partly to give the program some star power.  However, mostly it indicates what these students can become if they can receive diplomas.
I doubt the programs producer was thinking about the following, but it is significant to me.  These students HAVE DARK SKIN.  Spanish-language TV channels have been repeatedly condemned for rendering people of darker hue invisible.  Those shows like to imagine that all Latinos are visually of European descent.  In this documentary, they got some melanin up in there.  The six students were strongly of indigenous or African ancestry.  This program had no Andy Garcias, Christinas, or Frankie Munizes.
The program has two parts: one of the girls and one on the boys.  One expert stated that LatinO boys drop out of school at higher rates than LatinAs.  Implicitly, the program suggests that gender matters.  However, some may be frustrated that the program does not say more on the topic.  I was excited to see Dr. Pedro Noguera interviewed here.  Still, I would have loved to see Dr. Nancy Lopez, the author of Hopeful Girls, Troubled Boys speaking.
All of the six students speaks English fluently, even if their parents do not.  I could be wrong, but I got the sense that high dropout rates among Latinos have to do with older ones not speaking English and being embarrassed about being 13yo 5th graders or 17yo freshmen.  The existence and effectiveness of bilingual education is not really addressed here.  I also have some concerns that some issues are moot.  If I understand, right before the 2012 election, President Obama signed an executive order saying that youth who were brought to the country undocumented could now qualify for financial aid.  Hispanic politicians in Illinois fought for the undocumented here to be able to go to state universities years ago.  Further, a friend of mine once worked at our alma mater.  He said the school admits illegals, its just that federal law did not allow them to receive federal aid.  Thus, it wasn't that the undocumented could not attend school; it was that they had to pay for it on their own.  Many accomplish that by working while attending reasonably-priced junior colleges.
The Latina student with a child wanted to have one; it wasn't an accident.  That frustrated me as much as I see teenage girls on Maury Povich yelling for the same thing.  One student at first cant attend college, but then does.  They never explain how that was possible.  Did it happen via fraud?  The openly gay student was a dancer, but I could imagine his weight being more of an impediment to that pursuit than his sexuality.  (And Im speaking as a fat dude muhself!)  The work never describes the discrimination he faces.  Still, it stood out to me that all of his friends were female.  I wonder if this means that male peers shunned him.  The former gang member stated that he was going to be an engineering major, but changed to psychology after mentoring disadvantaged youth.  Fine, its a free country, but talking heads argue that it would be better if more Blacks and Latinos received STEM diplomas.  Please see the book Opting Out.
Some viewers may be frustrated as this documentary moves slowly.  However, if you are used to the pace of reality shows and don't realize how staged they are, then you may have forgotten that real life usually moves slowly.  If you liked this documentary, you may want to see Dropout Nation and the I Am a Wise Latina episode of MTVs True Life.",1388102400,,3906,4.845688350983359
