8227335,3,B000X9LS68,"I must edit this review.  I would give it one star, but Amazon does not let me edit the rating.

I have just discovered that this dvd does NOT contain the full broadcast.  I noticed that part of the game from around the 16:52 mark of the second half to the 15:36 mark of the second half is missing.  That is pretty bad, given that these ""On Demand"" discs are supposed to show the entire game.  And I haven't even watched all of the disc, so who knows, it is possible that even more of the game is missing.

In addition, the first 10 seconds did not contain any audio, so that is another problem with the disc.

I also wish they showed more of the post game.  They did show a little bit of the on-court celebration after the final buzzer sounded, but they did not show any of the locker room celebration or trophy presentation.

The disc does not contain any bonus material.

One thing I noticed while handling the disc is that my fingers now have blue lines on them.  I just washed my hands with soap and the ink did not come off.  I have never seen any DVD or CD that has ink come off onto your fingers, until this one.  Very strange.  It may be due to the fact that it says ""DVD Video Disc DVD-R Format"" on it.  It is definitely a DVD-R, and I bought this directly from Amazon (not from any third party seller).",1198281600,2,1313,4.134387351778656
