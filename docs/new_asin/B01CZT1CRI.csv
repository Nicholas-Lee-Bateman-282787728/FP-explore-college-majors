7695196,5,B01CZT1CRI,One of the greatest tv shows I've watched. I loved it from start to finish.,1462924800,10,75,4.066666666666666
7695197,5,B01CZT1CRI,"Not having read the novel yet, I was completely unbiased when I watched this series.  I thought it was great, and I liked James Franco in the lead role.  The sets really took you back to the 60s, and the acting was superb all around.  The plot was thought provoking, and the ending was both emotional and satisfying.  I highly recommend this series, and I am planning on reading the book one day.",1462924800,29,396,4.383561643835616

7695200,1,B01CZT1CRI,"If came into this series thinking it would be a faithful adaptation of the stellar Stephen King book you will be disappointed by what you get. At the end of the series you are left cold with a feeling of somehow being cheated.
While the production was good to great the story left a lot to be desired.
In the book you really like Jake and you feel for him because he's a stranger in a strange land but not the James Franco Jake.
You just don't ever like him, he seems so miscast in this part. The introduction of Bill Turcotte as the sidekick was disappointing and the way he is played is annoying.
There were very few redeeming parts of this adaptation but not enough to make you want to watch it multiple times.
It seems that good Stephen King adaptations are few and far between, this is no exception.",1462752000,12,804,4.296052631578948
7695201,5,B01CZT1CRI,"One of the best miniseries events based on Stephen King's work.  Acting and casting were great.  Time period set pieces were extensive.  Suspense continually built until the finale and it's bitter sweet ending.  Not an exact translation of the book, as they left out some Derry scenes and essentially created a new character, but as close as they could get while creating a successful show.  Hulu and J.J. Abrams did a fine job!

This was a review of the show only, not the blu ray.",1462492800,57,482,4.6117647058823525
7695202,2,B01CZT1CRI,"Not sure why you would take a story for the world's most popular writer and change it.  The  story only marginally resembles the great book.

7695204,3,B01CZT1CRI,"Interesting movie of what could have all been different in our history if JFK was not shot. Very inventive and fascinating book as the two people go back in time to try to change the events so the assassination does not happen. Some don't work so they keep trying to refine their actions to change history. A great ""what-if"" movie with no conspiracy theories et al.",1532822400,,365,4.545454545454546

7695206,2,B01CZT1CRI,"I am an avid Stephen King reader and I usually enjoy his movies or in this case the series. This series strayed so far away from the book it""s almost unrecognizable. I certainly don't believe that This is what the author envisioned. The book was very visual and would have been a great series if it had been followed.",1532563200,,317,4.389830508474576
7695207,3,B01CZT1CRI,"I was going to read the novel, but I heard it was 1,000 pages. I still might. This subject intrigues me, about the past and can it be changed if you go back. This movie:obviously has some fallacies, but I understand what the producers or Stephen King is trying to say. To me: it meant Live in the present.(That's not a spoiler)

If you like these kind of movies, ie, can you change the past, I recommend ""Triangle"" with Melissa George. I watched it 3 times. Makes perfect sense after you watch it in it's entirety and just think on it. That's why I watched it over again. You'll have to hang with it for most of the movie, but keep your thinking cap on. It's not boring at all. It was way better than this movie. In fact, one of the best thought out movies made,  in my opinion.:Triangle.",1532390400,,788,4.246666666666667

7695213,5,B01CZT1CRI,"I was around in 1963, and this is not only a good yarn (of course it is, it's Stephen King!) watching it is like going back in a time machine.  I particularly loved looking at all the chrome and fins on the vintage cars.",1530835200,2,220,4.0

7695219,1,B01CZT1CRI,"I understand that movie/series adaptations of books are not going to be exactly the way it was in the book but this one wasn't even close. Granted I only made it through one episode and it could have followed the book perfectly the rest of the way but there was already so much that they changed. I can see how someone who has never read the book would enjoy it but if you've read the book I wouldn't recommend watching this.

Since I only made it through one episode I would like to find out how to get a refund for this.",1528761600,2,522,4.117647058823529

If you are fascinated with the JFK Assassination you HAVE TO see this! This has suspense, history, fantasy, even love and so much more because it's from STEPHEN KING! I didn't know that until I was watching it already. This MUST BE a part of my DVD home collection! The finale is MIND BLOWING!",1528502400,,407,4.230769230769231
7695221,5,B01CZT1CRI,"Back in 1998 or 1999, I had a dream that I was a local PI (Private Investigator) in 1963. I dreamed that I saved JFK from being assassinated. I kept thinking to myself, ""What if that became true? What would happen if JFK lived?"". Well, 18 or 19 years later, Steven King made a book about Saving JFK. Then it was a mini-series that was almost what I have dreamed about. Only this was about a time traveler; not a local gum shoe. After viewing this DVD, I said that this video is totally awesome. Just like my dream, Jake, the main character, beat the crap out of Lee Harvey Oswald before he shot him with own rifle. Steven King did a wonderful job on this story.",1528070400,,661,4.21259842519685

And if you did, would it necessarily be for the better?

7695226,1,B01CZT1CRI,"I bought because I loved the steven king novel (actually the audible edition).  However this mini-series adaptation barely resembles the book.  Unfortunately it was drastically dumbed down rendition of of the novel.  The novel was very interesting historical twist and historical intertwining of the main character with the assassination of JFK, much the same way a James Michener novel would.

This rendition miniseries was so stripped of the interesting aspects of the Novel, so that I can only assume that it was intended to be understandable by the mainstream masses who probably barely know who JFK was. The story was drastically changed as to be almost unrecognizable.

I would not recommend wasting your time on this if you are a fan of the Steven King Novel as it will only disappoint you.",1526428800,2,797,5.007575757575758
7695227,3,B01CZT1CRI,The book is WAY better. I'm not a huge fan of how this was done but it was definably worth watching just to relive the book experience. It just deviated so much that I spent more time comparing the two than enjoying this series.,1525478400,,228,4.204545454545454

However when I played disc two it did not continue the story line.  This disc must be from another season.  It skipped a huge part of the story about the janitors family.  I guess I should return for a replacement with the correct discs.

It sounds like gears grinding. Because of that it gets only three stars. It plays, and the grinding eventually does stop.

7695245,2,B01CZT1CRI,"It was different than the book.  Well, the same, but different.  They switched things around, kept me guessing as to what exactly was going to happen next, but the basic story was the same.  At least they didn't try to put Obama on a pedestal.  What I really DIDN't like about it was the romance (I HATE romances/had forgotten about that part of the book--how? I dunno but I did).  And it was kind of dumb, the guy goes through the rabbit-hole and comes out in the middle of the street with a whole crowd of people around--but nobody notices he's there.",1517184000,,553,4.382352941176471

7695250,2,B01CZT1CRI,"I'm going to be stereotypical here and say that the book is better than the miniseries. James Franco did a good job as Jake Epping/George Amberson, though in the miniseries he is is Jake/Jake. I had a high expectations for this miniseries. Basing a movie off of a Stephen King novel is impossible, especially when the novel is 11/22/63. The book was one of my favorites of Stephen King and I thought a miniseries would be able to truly capture the spirit and intricacy of the book. I was wrong. Without giving too many spoilers, I will just say that the miniseries deviates too much from the book for my liking. My biggest problem was that Bill Turcotte plays a relatively small roll in the book, and somehow was made into a main character that simply was frustrating. Such a huge part of the book is how alone Jake/George is, which is why (in my opinion) he falls in love with Sadie. Having Bill Turcotte be a part of the miniseries simply created frustration and unnecessary drama. There was enough drama in the book to make it interesting without making Turcotte a main character. The other thing that bothered me was that the Yellow Card Man was barely a part of the miniseries, and played such an important roll in the big picture of the book. Yes, I am a snob when it comes to film adaptations, but this was a miniseries that had the opportunity to make a great adaptation and it simply wasn't good.",1515456000,14,1405,4.4921875

It has been years since I read the book so as far as I can remember, it followed it fairly well.  It was made well and I was very impressed with all the acting.

And Franco and the rest of the cast definitely turn in solid performance in a show that could otherwise seem totally unbelievable.  Definitely one of the best premises for a science fiction/time travel story.  Kudos to King for writing the original work that this show is based on, but kudos to this cast and crew for centering it in the way it needed to be.  Also as a History major, someone interested in historic architecture and the history of Pop music it is very believable to the events and time displayed in the past, even more so then ""Mad Men"" was.",1510704000,,719,4.507692307692308

7695273,1,B01CZT1CRI,"I finished reading the book by Mr. King. It was the first full novel I had read by King (I did read The Mist) and found it to be a tremendous book. It starts a bit slow but man does it pick up and get good. It was a con't put it down page turner. So I was super excited to see this series as I heard good things about it. Man, what a let down. They changed so much from the book. While that is always to be expected with an adaptation, the changes they made were head scratching and bordering on ridiculous. Ok, not bordering on....they were ridiculous. I won't go into detail to spoil it for anyone, but one of the moist important relationships in the book is short changed in the series. And one character who didn't play that much of a role in the book was given a bizarre and major role in the series. Plus what this character does it beyond laughable. One of the climatic scenes in Dallas (guess which one) is played like a scene from a Jason Borne movie and was just awful. Anyway, I could go on.

7695278,4,B01CZT1CRI,Spoilers ahead---I thought this was a really great adaptation to the book I had no problems with the changes they made. The star off is because of the lack of chemistry between the two leads Jake and Sadie. I though James Franco did a good job playing Jake Amberson until the scenes with young Sadie he had more chemistry with end of the series Sadie. Billy had better chemistry with Marina.,1506124800,,391,4.52112676056338

I always thought that this book would have made a great movie, but my wife disagreed because the story is so incredibly complicated.  I found the Blu Ray set at Best Buy last week and bought it immediately. Both my wife and I truly enjoyed the mini series.  Every bit as good as the book.

7695323,5,B01CZT1CRI,"These are not spoilers since they are written on the back of the cover.  This Mini-series based on a book by the great master Stephen King explores what might happen if you could go back to a certain point in time and go through the preparations leading up to changing the past.  In the movie the past fights back, because let's face it, the past does not want to be changed. Furthermore, what would happen if you fell in love with someone in the past while you are there?  This is a well thought out story with a beginning and an end, unlike some of King's stories adapted to television looking for another season. At times, the story gets bogged down with semantics, but those times are few and far between. It is slow moving at times as well, but there are also suspenseful times when you think you know what might happen and BAMM something else happens. I have to admit I enjoyed most of it immensely, the parts I did not enjoy I will not go into as I don't want to give away any spoilers. Since we already know that the main character goes back in time to the 1960's I will also state that the makers of this film do an amazing job of recreating the look and feel of the 1960's.  Because the 1960's were a very racist time period, you will see racism in this series. I overpaid for the series, because it is Stephen King, and I wanted it for my collection, I suggest you wait until it comes down in price before buying it. It's already $2 less than what I paid, I suggest it will be significantly less in a coming months. Should you buy it, definitely.

The acting was very good, and the characters were all interesting.

I enjoyed this series until right at the end when to me. It just fell flat.

** Spoilers ***

Right from the start, I questioned the theme, would stopping the assassination of Kennedy make that much difference?  I doubt it. Okay you avoid much of the American side of the Vietnam war but that still leaves most of it with all the killings to proceed, however, certainly for less time. To me, the story might have made much more sense to say kill Hitler, Mao or Stalin. Having said that the ending I did not like at all nor did I think it made sense. I doubt this is the best of all possible worlds, although I am not sure how you end such a time-travel show.

Nor did I like after the assassination, how our hero started raving like a conspiracy nut. I am sure the FBI would have demanded that our hero told them why how he knew so much.",1488844800,,1055,4.198019801980198

If you're a King fan or a Constant Reader who hasn't arrived at 11.22.63 - READ THE BOOK FIRST.

However, I understand why the screenwriter felt it necessary to have a second character to bounce off Jake as he does his investigation so that the story didn't become entirely a voiceover by Jake.  What I found most disappointing was how the dystopian future was portrayed.  All we saw was Jake's Maine hometown turned into an ex-war zone, and a short visit with Harry in his hellhole of a home.  Nothing about how the future had really been altered for the worse for all humankind because of Jake's actions in saving JFK.  I was most intrigued by the book's depiction of a dystopian future and hoped it would be fleshed out in the miniseries.

So I can not provide any validation of the accuracy to his portrayal. What I can say is Daniel Webber's character is lovingly hatable. His life backdrops the story in a genuine way.

Viewers know that this flick about the Kennedy Assassination of 1963 and what would happen if we could have prevented the murder?  Stephen King is a master of not only horror, but spine-tingling twists and turns that make the viewer/reader never want to hesitate until the very end.  I went out on a limb saying this was King's best.  Trust me...it is.  It's a mix of everything he has ever created...chiller, thriller, horror and science fiction all wrapped into one neatly packaged E-ticket ride into a world no one has ever been before.  James Franco, Sarah Gadon and George MacKay make this film a masterpiece.  If you're a KIng fan, don't miss it.  It has everything you would want in a production...from terror to romance.

Since it was in a MINI-SERIES format, there really was no reason for them to not stick to the story line. Those who never read the book might enjoy it, but the those who read the book will be disappointed.

7695479,5,B01CZT1CRI,"Although there are some differences to the book (the most obvious being the door took you back to 1958 in the book instead of 1960 adding an extra two years to each time Jake goes back if he gets it wrong and needs to reset), the book is a lot closer to the end product we see on the screens than most movies/TV shows adapted from his novels.  Jake also doesn't go back and forth through the door as much as in the novel but other than that there isn't much I would have liked the TV series to have done which it didn't.

The basic plot of this one is a diner owner has been travelling back in time to 1960 through a porthole in his diner's cupboard.  Each time he goes back it only takes two minutes from the present date, but he ages in real time for the duration he is in the past. Having lost a son in Vietnam, he is determined to stop the assassination of JFK.  However with years to go until 63 in the past he is diagnosed with cancer so must return to 2015 where he hopes to recruit long time caring customer and school teacher Jake to complete his mission.  Jake however is hesitant but eventually decides to complete the mission.  Jake however hasn't taken the experienced advice of the diner owner as seriously as he should have, and is distracted by his own objectives along the way.

The of course problem with this scenario is always even if Jake is successful in doing what he wants, and even lives happily from 2015 until dying of old age, eventually someone else will walk into the cupboard in the diner, or knock it down when he dies and walk through the space in the air resetting everything to play out with the JFK assassination and only altered by whatever they do in 1960.  I also wondered why no one in 1960 comes forward in time through the space in the air since there is no barrier stopping them and there are plenty of people nearby who would stumble into it. Even if you put up a barrier in the closet so they never knew they had traveled to 2015 and turned back, they would reset time when turned around and went back.  If you were in the past during that occurring, would you not be wiped out of existence, at least until you are born again?  But none of this actually matters to events happening while in the past in the  TV show, so it's still a good thriller none the less.  Of course it's not as good as the book but it's still worth checking out.",1476230400,,2381,4.208791208791209

They made some clever adjustments to accomplish some elements of the book that would have been too difficult/long for the screen. James Franco is, as always, great. I wish Sarah Gadon would appear in every movie made (ala Samuel Jackson)... she is amazing as Sadie!!! Her range of emotions are incredible (observe her after the neck slash) and she's the perfect King heroine  you will fall in love with her as you admire her strength as well as her sweetness. Daniel Webber has every nuance of Lee Harvey Oswald's voice and movements. Tonya Pinkins is astonishing and brings such depth to Mimi's character; same for Jonny Coyne. The use of music to illustrate time changes is masterful.

7695493,5,B01CZT1CRI,"In his novel, 11.22.63, where a man travels back in time to prevent the Kennedy assassination, I thought Stephen King was channeling Rod Serling; after seeing the Hulu produced mini-series, Ive come to believe 11.22.63 is truly the greatest Rod Serling story that the master of the Twilight Zone never wrote.  Its truly one genius honoring another. I would say King does a better job honoring Serling in 11.22.63 than he did channeling Lovecraft in his novel, Revival.

And like many a good Twilight Zone episode, this story turns on an inexplicable occurrence that defies the laws of time and space. In 11.22.63, it a back room in a little diner in Maine that contains a portal which allows anyone who steps through it to come out back in the year of 1960.  No matter how times one goes through and comes back, the portal always resets to the same day and time in 1960, while no matter how long one stays in the past, be it days, weeks, or even years, only two minutes will have passed in the present day.  The series, like the book, is not about the science of time travel and trying to find a way to rationally explain it away; instead it is a story of ordinary people swept up into a truly extraordinary circumstance and the ways in which they deal with it.

The hero of the book and the show, Jake Epping, a high school English teacher, is one of Kings best everyman characters, one who steps up when the diners owner, Al Templeton, fails in his attempt to journey into the past and save JFK when he is diagnosed with terminal cancer a year short of stopping the assassination.  Al believes saving the President will prevent the Vietnam War, reason enough to spend three years in the past trying to determine if Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, then stopping him from pulling the trigger on that fateful day in Dallas.  But as Al has found out the hard way, the past does not want to be changed and will push back against any attempt to interfere with it, nevertheless, Jake is game to try and armed with Als exhaustive historical research-which includes the winners of every major and minor sporting event to place bets on-goes through the portal in the back of the diner with the intention of completing the mission and saving Kennedy. Although Jake thinks he is prepared for what he will encounter, including a past that resists being changed, he does not count on how much he will become part of 20th Century America as journeys toward that fateful day in November.

The TV adaptation makes some changes from the novel, some of which I feel are real improvements; the role of a secondary character is elevated to that of Jakes partner in stopping Oswald; a plot twist is added so that Jake is forced race to the Texas School Book Depository with minutes to spare in order to prevent the fatal shot from being fired. I was disappointed that the side trip to Derry. Maine and an encounter with a couple of characters from IT (another tie that helps bind all of Kings books together) was dropped; that and Jakes relationships with a number of his students in 60s Texas. I feel it is a case of some things working better on the page while other things work better in a TV script.  There is also some tweaking of the story near the end when Jake returns to present and discovers how changing history has affected the 21st Century-a little more explanation would have added some punch to this big reveal.  A couple of  other things don't ring true, such as having Jake and Bill live right underneath Lee Harvey Oswald and his Russian bride yet have no relationship with them at all and having Jake just being allowed to bluff his way out of the custody of the Dallas PD and the FBI in the aftermath of November 22nd.  But the latter was true in the book as well.

The one great thing about the book that the mini-series does very well is the relationship between Jake and Sadie Dunhill, the fellow teacher at the Texas high school where he takes a job.  No one thinks of King as a great writer of love stories, but in Jake and Sadie, he creates a truly memorable romantic couple, a pair we really root for to stay together, and yes, the mini-series keeps the very bittersweet resolution of Jake and Sadies affair intact.  They also did a great job of recreating the early 60s, making the AMERICAN GRAFFITI era come alive with its big automobiles, men wearing hats, cigarettes dangling, and working mans bars.

James Franco might seem an odd choice to play an everyman hero like Jake Epping, but I think this is some of his best work; Sarah Gadon is a perfect match for him as Sadie, she is the complete personification of the character from the book.  Brian Webber does a great job as Lee Harvey Oswald; we will never know what went on in this mans mind or what made him tick, but Webbers portrait rings true to what we know from history and the character from Kings book.  The rest of the supporting cast is filled with familiar faces: Josh Duhamel, Gil Bellows, Nick Searcy, Tonya Pinkins (Enid Peabody on GOTHAM), Annette OToole, Michael ONiell, Cherry Jones, Leon Rippy, Kevin J. OConner and T.R. Knight, with Academy Award winner Chris Cooper as Al Templeton.

I watched 11.22.63 on Blu Ray and it confirmed my conviction that this show is made for binge watching; at eight episodes, its well under the length of a cable TV series, which normally run at least a dozen episodes or a network show which usually clocks in at 20 episodes; and we the satisfaction of a complete story with a beginning, middle and an end. Franco directed one of the episodes while King himself contributed to the script; J.J. Abrams was an executive producer.  Maybe he could buy the rights to Under the Dome and produce a better mini-series based on that book than the awful one CBS inflicted on us for three summers in a row.  Its a suggestion.",1474934400,,5829,4.521863117870723

7695509,5,B01CZT1CRI,"A review of the mini-series and NOT a review of how faithful it was to the book (it wasn't).

Was I/were we intrigued?  Damned skippy!  This was well put together.  Was it a video replica of the book?  Nope, but close.

11.22.63 is a great ""What If...?""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/novel/dp/1451627297/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">novel</a>&nbsp;and movie.  James Franco plays the primary character, and he does it well and with conviction.  Reading a book, each person creates in their mind their own visuals of the characters by the presentation of facts and clues from the author.  While I didn't see Franco in my mind while I read the book, I certainly wasn't opposed to it when he appeared.  In fact, I rather liked the choice.

Unrelated to the book in any way was the character of Bill (British actor George MacKay).  However, as a character in the mini-series he supported much of what needed to be said in the space of time allotted.  I was also well taken with MacKay's ability to ""get"" the generic Southern accent down nicely.  It sounded natural.

To spoil the movie would be a sin but the premise is, ""Can you alter history without repercussions?""  For those old enough to remember, 11-22-63 was the date JFK was assassinated, supposedly by Lee Harvey Oswald.  This movie isn't about whether Oswald was a dupe or whether it was his own doing.  It's about whether JFK's assassination can be prevented and the world go on its merry way to what we know today.

As a bonus, actor James Franco is also a producer and author of this book, Stephen King and famed director J.J. Abrams are both Executive Producers",1473897600,,1663,4.9818181818181815
7695510,5,B01CZT1CRI,Took several days to see this since it appeared to be made as a mini series - roughly 8 hrs.  But totally worth it!  Watching two hours at a time made me anticipate the next day as to wondering what would happen next.  Seems to be part truth mixed in with what ifs.,1473811200,,265,3.9622641509433962
7695511,4,B01CZT1CRI,"Not meaning that it's very short--the book it's based on is too long for that. But King has decided to do roughly the same thing here that he did when he made ""Under the Dome"" into a full-season series--hour-long episodes like with an ordinary TV drama series. If you'll recall, the word ""miniseries"" in the case of King's ""The Stand"" and ""It"" meant the traditional format--each episode the length of a two-hour movie.

Teacher Jake Epping has a friend named Al Templeton,. who owns a greasy spoon diner which sits on a time portal. One that connects to the early autumn of 1958. And as the men get to know each other better, Al lets Jake in on the secret. He's been using the specific destination of the portal to put himself in the position of preventing Lee Harvey Oswald's assassination of John F Kennedy. The way King approaches the event isn't really clich&eacute;. In 2011 Lisbon, Maine, Al's health has deteriorated to where he doubts that he can do the job. It is subtly implied that the reason may be the time travel. Having Jake as a regular at Al's diner gives him an idea. Jake is a teacher whose duties include adult education classes. One of his recent grads is a handicapped janitor who he recently helped to get his GED. Harry Dunning's disability stems from a rampage by his ""mean drunk"" and mentally unstable father, who also murdered his mother and three siblings in the same attack, leaving Harry as the sole survivor. So why not send Jake back to that time to save his student, as sort of a ""test run"" before the big Dallas '63 Mission? Harrys hometown is in Kentucky, unlike the books Derry, Maine, the scene of Kings earlier book and miniseries It. Casting this miniseries with an episode containing a ""return to Derry"" would perhaps have entailed rounding up two kid actors who resembled their predecessors in the 1990 miniseries. So King and Abrams just opted for a change of venue.

So now it's time to head for Dallas. Where Jake goes to work in the Texas town of Jodie as a high school teacher, working for a likeable principal named Deke Simmons who befriends Jake. As well as matchmaking him with librarian Sadie Dunhill by assigning them as a chaperon team for a school prom. I'll take this no further--any of the stuff about Jake meeting Lee Harvey Oswald, working to prevent the assassination in Dallas. As before--similar reason. Suffice it to say that the biggest thing making King a lot different from other horror authors is that he creates sympathetic characters, people you can't help but LIKE. From Jake Epping, our hero. To the ailing, dying Al Templeton. To Harry Dunning, maimed but pleasant night-school grad. To Jake's love interest, the charming Sadie Dunhill. To their boss, principal Deke Simmons. Stephen King still gives us people we can do more than root for or empathize with--we can actually LIKE them as people.",1473811200,,2866,4.707171314741036

7695529,2,B01CZT1CRI,"This miniseries is a huge disappointment.  Given the subject (a man goes back in time to try to prevent the assassination of JFK), it should have been an exciting story that held the viewer's interest.  Instead, it is heavily padded with mostly irrelevant digressions, so that the central story is lost for long stretches.  The only two really good episodes are the first, which sets up the plot, and the last, which shows the end-result of the hero's efforts.  The final part of that last episode is particularly frustrating and unsatisfying -- it claims that some very bad things happen, without making any real attempt to explain why they happen.  The audience is cheated, unnecessarily (the book spends a page or two explaining in detail what happened between 1964 and the present).

The only thing that is done well is the recreation of life in the U.S. during the early 1960's.  The miniseries deserves credit for the effort it spends on this, but that does not make up for its flaws.",1473292800,,990,4.754385964912281

7695533,5,B01CZT1CRI,"William Faulkner once observed that ""The past isn't dead. It's not even past"". That quotation plays well into the adaption of Stephen King's acclaimed novel ""11.22.63"". The premise isn't all that original (there have been a couple short stories that I've read over the years that use the same premise once of which was adapted for a 1985 episode of ""Twilight Zone"") how well a novel is received has less to do with the originality of the premise itself but execution and King does a marvelous job of crafting rich, realistic characters and playing with the premise of the novel in a creative, nuanced way. There are some flaws--quite a bit gets lost in translating an 800 plus page novel into eight hours. Some of the changes work for the better, some not so much but if you haven't read the book, you won't notice.

James Franco plays Jake Epping a teacher who seems lost and without purpose until he friend tells him about a portal that will take him back in time. Jake now has a mission to stop the assassination of President Kennedy. What Jake discovers, however, is that the past has other ideas. As Jake gets drawn into the world of 1963, he finds he's overwhelmed by the world he has come to change.

Adaptions of novels can be tricky--a film or TV version can be too faithful to the point where the show has no lyricism and is too literal or the adaption ends up losing the tone and feeling of what made the novel so effective if the project plays too loose and fast with the source material. The middle ground that the producers and writers of ""11.22.63"" take here works in favor of the project.

The producers manage to compress King's sprawling novel into a eight hour presentation. Having said that, it's not a perfect mini-series but it is exceptional.

The transfer looks exceptionally good with nice detail, depth and color which is to be expected for a recent show like this. The audio sounds terrific as well creating an immersive atmosphere. English subtitles are provided as well. The set features eight episodes on two discs.

The special features are a bit disappointing. We get a fifteen minute featurette that has plenty of meat such as interviews with King, producer Bridgett Carpenter, the cast and others discussing the challenges of adapting a novel as sprawling as the source for this show. I'm a believer in commentary tracks and I also think that Warner could have sprung for other features such as the challenges of recreating the past, costuming and other aspects of the production. This is a fine featurette but it could have been nicely supplemented by more.

""11.22.63"" asks some provocative questions about destiny and is very engaging with some terrific performances.",1473033600,7,2704,4.754797441364605

The lead characters were all convincing and fascinating, although Bill least of all, and the pace of the story is about right. Where this series really scores is that for all the differences to the original, it retains King's novel's heart. The denouement is moving and throughout the story it is emotionally satisfying. it is also intellectually interesting,as King asks us whether there is something to this ""fate"" idea, and ponders the morality of power and responsibility.

If you have read the book and loved it, you will be disappointed.  If you haven't read the book, you will probably like it, if you are into the genre.

7695559,5,B01CZT1CRI,"Thats right. This King story receives 5 stars by me as one of my all time favorite of his novels. I have quite a few and this is one of them. Welcome to the Age of myself, where Stephen King brings you back to a world where JFK was not the mythical character he is considered to be today by most people of my generation but rather a very, very real person. Part angel, part devil, part the best story teller, a terrible propagandist, and whose speeches many consider to be among the worst any president can possibly froth mouth from his moving lips. But they are missing the point. The presidents are not the reason their speeches such, its the guys that write those speeches. The presidents are not the reason domestic or foreign policy sucks - its how people perceive their concept of how domestic and foreign policy should be run. Everything is not the fault of LBJ, Obama, JFK, Acchilles, Odin, Satan, zionists, etc. Zionism is a philosophy that grew out of the zionist movement, in an age that preceded the internet that is killing it today. And King has the masterful skill of bringing us - believers and disbelievers in the legendary character of JFK together, to read the ultimate Kennedy magnum opus. Perhaps this is why I have so few Kennedy books in my library. I have flip flipped through quite a few, and when I did so with this one, I knew that even though it is a novel, it is still telling a bit of truth here, and a bit of truth there. Truths that speak to our hearts, and force us to think first with our hearts, and then react using our minds when researching a topic as complex and terrifying as political myths and their central figureheads. The story is not per ce about linear time travel, which may surprise most readers, but is instead about choices. Linear travel through time is an opportunity - you take it, or you leave it. But 11.22.63 is a choice. That's something a bit different. You don't just choose whether or not you are going to fix something like the JFK assassination. What if, for example, he never existed? Of course this novel does not have to promote that idea because it is not meant to, but that's my personal favorite JFK conspiracy theory. It was all just an act, poof, the main actors show that the main characters can vanish from our  memories like the air we have finished breathing by breakfast. Here, things take a bit more sinister turn. Which is perhaps what makes this novel and this TV show so good, which makes me want to watch it. Despite you may think that JFK was just myth, do not make the mistake of ignoring 11.22.63. Doing so would be as stupid as ignoring the opportunity to buy a 1998 furby knowing you have the money and a good excuse to do it. Just remember this date. Know its important, and know that, perhaps, any of us may wake up in a situation where we are asked to choose between allowing a man to shoot a man who is about to be shot who is being driven by a car, or choosing to do something and prevent it, changing the course of human history. Eventually you find out that you do not need to go through time in a traditional linear fashion to change the future, when we now have the technology to simply send animated avatars of ourselves anywhere we want them to go to alternative timelines we create ourselves. But this is different. This is alternative history in the making, where the reader feels they have some form of control, by observing a very realistic alternative that is told in a style that is unlike anything you are likely to encounter with other alternative history novels, most of which deal with what would have happened if nazi Germany had won WWII.  Thankfully our world is of course prettier than this, but that is not required for such a complex and richly detailed and well organized and carefully plotted storyline that which unfolds in this work. For this story is here to boldly remind us of the importance of the fact that no matter who we are and what we do, we will never be able to prevent all the bad things from happening in life. And with them all the mistakes we will eventually learn from. But we can learn from such mistakes in advance.",1471737600,,4151,4.42483660130719

7695561,5,B01CZT1CRI,"Quite possibly the best Stephen King adaptation I've seen.  Even if you are not a fan of King's more supernatural entries, this book/film are more along the lines of Shawshank Redemption & the Green Mile - grounded in reality with a slightly supernatural plot device, in this case, an unexplained wormhole in time back to 1960.

I loved the book, and for once, the series stays faithful to almost all the key characterizations and plot points.  This was extremely well done, well acted, very entertaining, and while definitely intended to entertain adults, is an interesting and engaging foray into 20th century American history as well.  There was generally very good attention to historical detail, and the pacing was solid throughout the series.  The story moved along nicely, and I couldn't stop watching.

7695566,2,B01CZT1CRI,"As other reviewers have mentioned, the producers of the miniseries of Stephen Kings best book in years badly damaged a valuable property by trying to tell a complicated story in only 9 hours.  If there was one show that might have benefited from a traditional 22-episode arc this was it.  I enjoyed the book and was shocked to see so many changes applied to the story that, coupled with hideous casting mistakes, just tore my heart out as I watched it, screaming to my wife that, Believe me, the book was actually good.

As many have pointed out, the expansion of Bill Turcottes characterwhere once he was merely the brother of the first wife of the first serial killers lust for bloodtook us by surprise and then, with episode after episode providing no real reason for him to be there, let us down.  It was not so much that young George MacKay was bad in the part; in fact we were amazed to see his talent given a broader scope since his one-note part in the British historodrama Pride (2013), but why cut out huge parts of Stephen Kings novel to provide MacKay with an acting reel like no one elses in recent TV memoryOK, maybe the boy in Mr. Robot gets to do more stuff than Billbut not by much.

People sem to understand that, yes, the adapters had to bring in Bill as Jakes roommate in order to give his thoughts an outlet, but if they had hired an actor more expressive than James Franco they wouldnt have had to do any such thing.  Even in 127 Hours, Danny Boyle didn't say to himself, James Franco is trapped between boulders all alone without anyone to talk to and tell them how he feels.  Danny Boyle didn't invent another hiker also trapped between boulders so the two of them could holler at each other and get plot points across.

Far too much time in both novel and miniseries trying to pretend that the dull enigma George de Mohrenschildt an interesting character.  But King fails to make much out of Lee or Marina Oswald, what can he do to animate the mysterious, and dull dull dull de Mohrenschildt?  Nothing!  Like most enigmas, you never want to solve him, just to put him out of our misery.  Yes it is into this nexus that the filmmakers decide they can make Billy shine.  He does, but the picture of Oswalds life is so murky that one doesnt trust anything the film has to say about who killed JFK.  Hiring Americas greatest actress, Cherry Jones, and giving her third billing in the credits, would make you think they were going to give her something to do?  Instead she just appears three or four times to act acerbic and to trot forth a lousy Russian accent.  Misuse of great talent!

I tried but could not take to the actress who plays Sadie Dunhill.  Im sure she is talented, but she is nothing like Sadie.  That girl is a goofy, Amazonian, accident-prone comedienne who manages to make the whole package super sexylike a Carole Lombard or, in the JFK era, we had Paula Prentiss.  The actress who plays Sadie, well, she doesnt convince me that a shallow narcissist like James Franco would reform to win her.  And who on earth said, Lets make Miss Mimi black?!  In the book Miss Mimi can hold forth as Jakes version of social authoritybut I don't think in in a small Texas town like Jodie, a black woman could have taken the same role.  There is a scene where Miss Mimi is shown as the victim of some ugly ordinary racism, but why have that taking up time in a 9 hours miniseries when how many black women were assistant principals in any white public high school in Texas in 1959or even today?

Well, I could go on all day, and every time I think of the contemptible miniseries that JJ Abrams and Bridget Carpenter made out of a decent book, I go a little Lawrence Harvey in Manchurian Candidate so I better quit now.  Hulu, you have done your worst; succeeding shows have got to be better.",1471305600,12,3816,4.424892703862661
7695567,5,B01CZT1CRI,"OK, the book  Stephen Kings best in more than two decades in my opinion only  is outstanding, populated by great, believable characters, its well researched and, in fact, a real page turner. Mostly Hollywood never does real justice to Kings books and TV has an even worse track record (for example, the impenetrable Under the Dome), but this time they seem to have gotten it mostly right, even down to the look and feel of the times.

Yes, the producers (and writers) had to edit content here and there and bring in a supporting actor to serve as Jakes (James Francos) conscience as he tries to complete his mission but overall this was a miniseries that worked. I had read many of the comments here about the casting of James Franco in the title role and wondered if he could pull it off as he wasn't the face I imagined in the novel. Surprisingly though hes steady as well as believable throughout. And the actress who plays Sadie Dunhill, (Sarah Gadon) is truly a wonder and born to play this role. In fact, I dare anyone who hasn't yet read the novel to try and imagine anyone else playing her in the book. Like the book, the miniseries ends on a poignant, pitch perfect, even sublime note and may even bring a lump to your throat (it did me). If youve read the novel, see this adaptation as soon as you can. And even if you haven't read it, see these episodes and know that an even richer experience awaits you within the pages of Stephen Kings award-winning (and deservedly so) novel.

7695571,4,B01CZT1CRI,"This is a good to very good adaptation of a very long (as most know) book of the same title by Stephen King. It tells the story of a high school English teacher who has a chance to go back in time, to one specific day in 1960, to then live for three years in the past in order to prevent the assassination of President Kennedy. The series stars James Franco as Jake Epping the main character of the story, and produced by King and J.J. Abrams. I think the miniseries format was the only way the story could be told and stay even somewhat faithful to the book, because there is just so much that happens.

Of course, because the book is so long a lot had to be cut out and changed. Some worked, and some did not work as well. One key point from the book that I do not think came across as well in the series is that, not only will the past resist being changed, but the larger impact the event being changed has on history, the harder the past will push back and try and stop it. The concept gets fleshed out much more in the book because there are different levels of events changing and we get to see the past interfere in different ways, from minor initially to very severe at the end. There is much more jumping forward in the past than in the book. Given that they had to pack as much into 9 episodes as they could, they had to cut a lot, like the interaction between Jake and the students (which get referenced very quickly at one point) is mostly eliminated in the show.

The one big addition/change is expanding Bill's role. He plays a relatively minor role about a third of the way into the book, and that is it. But he is given a much larger role (mainly so they did not have to use voice overs for the exposition that played a large part in the book where we got it from Jake's point of view). Overall I could have done without that change, but I think it worked well enough by the time his character arc played out. The telling of the relationship between Jake and Sadie stayed pretty faithful to the book, but was also trimmed down for time. TR Knight did a great job in the role of her sadistic ex husband, and I was glad they kept his part in.

Overall I think the show told the main part of the story. If you are one who would be bugged by changes to the book however, as I said above, there are some, and they will probably bug you. It is just a question of how much. I think Franco did a good job in the role of Jake, even if he may not have been the greatest casting choice. For those who get the blu rays, the A/V quality is very good, but as is the case with most of the WB tv show sets there is no season play mode, so if you stop in the middle of an episode, you have to find your place again. It is not as big a deal with the small amount of episodes as with a 21 episode series, but still a pain. The only extra is a 15 min featurette called The Past Fights Back, which is basically a making of and behind the scenes feature. There are no deleted scenes or commentary tracks.

All in all I would say the series is worth checking out. It is not as good as the book, but if you can accept that and be okay with it, I think you can find it enjoyable.",1471132800,28,3171,4.012658227848101

7695579,4,B01CZT1CRI,"First off, I LOVED the book. I've read it at least five times and was beside myself when I heard it was going to be made into a movie, then into a miniseries. After all that's even better right? So much more can be put in.

Well... there are parts that are left out. Ok, even with about 7.5 hours, the book was huge so things are obviously going to get left out. BUT things were added in.  Why take things out to save time only to add stuff in that makes no real sense or has a point?

The main reason he decided to go back is barely glossed over, and then almost never revisited and was such an important part of the book.

And the car! I was so disappointed when it was a different color, make AND model that was used. Would it have been that difficult to find the right car?

Ok, enough negative stuff. The show in itself was really good. If I had not read the book, I would have given it 5 stars. However, because it was based on the books, I can only give it four.",1470787200,6,969,3.9742268041237114
7695580,5,B01CZT1CRI,"""11/22/63"" is one of my favorite King books, second perhaps only to ""The Stand"". For those new to the story, the basic premise is that a recently divorced English teacher finds a 'rabbit hole' that leads him back to 1960 (1958 in the book). At the suggestion of his friend, the dying Al Templeton, he decides to use this opportunity to save JFK from assassination.

Needless to say I was very excited for this televised adaption, and while it was not perfect, I believe that ultimately it stayed true to the story.  Viewers should expect there to be certain changes and breaks from the story for the sake of time; but nothing that, I believe, is detrimental. If you're unsure about making the purchase I would recommend watching the series on Hulu first; first time subscribers can get a thirty-day free trial, which is ample enough time to watch this 8 Part Series. Also Constant Readers should keep an eye out for some fun Easter Eggs! There are some fun cameo mentions or appearances that will tickle fans of King, if you're paying attention for them.

I'd like to take a few moments to actually describe the product, and not just the story, for potential buyers. I purchased the Blu-Ray edition. The product is solid quality--reliable high definition and broken down into two discs. Each disc contains four episodes, with the second also containing a special feature commentary on the making of the television show. Buyers should really expect no more than that. Even the menu is a very basic, default menu that is in no way decorative (aka themed to fit the show or the menu picture). While it may not be as aesthetically pleasing, the most important thing is the episodes, which seem to all have played smoothly.

Overall?
Satisfied with the show.

7695592,2,B01CZT1CRI,"My review is from the viewpoint of someone who read the book version of the story before watching the film adaptation. I felt the story in movie form lacked the soul of the book. The character of Jake Epping, was played rather weakly by James Franco, who seems to run the gamut of emotion from A to B. He seems uncomfortable in any scene where he must show any genuine care or concern for other characters, and plays at it awkwardly, so that the most ""touching"" scenes become uncomfortable to watch. The sets themselves lack much substance and seem to be cheap, upon closer inspection. With at least two big-hitters as producers, J.J. Abrams and King himself, it is pretty obvious that most expenses were spared. Despite these failings, Webber, as Lee Harvey Oswald, was riveting to watch. The very unimportant scene where he comes into the police department to write a letter for the agent is mesmerizing due to the obvious detail work he has put into ""filling out"" the character of LHO. He shows the precise perfection of every movement, which helps to convey his overwhelming perfectionism as a person. The addition Epping's friend, Bill throughout most of the apartment dwelling scenes seemed strange, but I suspect that having Franco carry a large part of the movie alone, with inward dialogue, would be daunting to even a more able actor. Franco couldn't have carried it.  Still, it made no sense to have such a bumbling, pretty idiotic ""wing-man"" during this very sensitive and deeply important surveillance of Kennedy's murderer. I sure wouldn't have kept around Bill for any length of time, nor would I have told him about my ""real"" persona, in light of his lack of discretion. Johnny Clayton, Sadie's estranged husband, was mesmerizing, however. He was gripping in his brief portrayal as a truly twisted and menacing character. Even though the movie did not outline his sexual darkness or his abuse of Sadie in as much detail, T.R. Knight gave us a character we truly wanted to hate. I almost wish there was more of him, as he seemed beyond equipped in his abilities as an actor. The very last item that truly bothered me was the dancing! Holy cow! This shouldn't have bothered me so much, but in the book, Jake's amazing dancing is really the inspiration for endearing both the students and Sadie to him. Some of the fun of the book were the great relationships Jake had with his students at the school. These did not exist in the film adaptation and leaves the viewer feeling less than invested in Jake as a character. The sloppiness that ensued when Jake begins dancing with Sadie was beyond cringe-worthy. It is unfortunate that Franco and company couldn't invest in an east-coast swing instructor for three bars of music, at least. It almost seems metaphorical for the film. It seems like a bare rough draft where all the details have been left out, just to get the job done.  The magic in the dancing, relationships, the humanity of Jake was INconveniently left out. On the whole, I felt the movie was not nearly as good as I had hoped it would be. It was merely a ghost of the compelling story King had originally written.",1468195200,4,3139,4.715846994535519

The entire cast shines as though they stepped right out of 1960's.

7695610,5,B01CZT1CRI,"I  heard about this series through a review, but couldn't find it on Amazon so I watched it on another server. On 11.22.63 I was a freshman in high school in Canada and had the afternoon off school to study for Xmas final exams. Of course I had the TV on, and when the news of the assassination broke through, it just blew my mind. I couldn't even conceive of such a tragic concept as assassination of a wildly popular president.
Needless to say I wanted to see this right away. I heard a couple of negative things about James Franco in the lead role.....and I'm not a huge fan, but I thought he did a great job. The big treat here is Daniel Webber as Lee Harvey Oswald. It was as if he had risen from the grave to walk the earth again.....
I was so mesmerized by his capture of the character I almost stopped breathing whenever he came on the screen. He was THAT GOOD!!!!
The whole presentation was excellent. I was transported back to that era and caught myself calling out the makes and models of the cars. Great acting all around. Josh Duhamel as Frank Dunning was horrifying.....this was the era when we as a Western civilization became aware of the dark side of the human soul. So the evil characters (Duhamel, T.R. Knight, the actor who played Sadie's estranged husband) seemed like they were right out of Twilight Zone.
I binge watched it and enjoyed every second. You don't have to be of that era to enjoy it. You can't help but be drawn in.....in fact, just writing this make as me want to watch it again!",1463788800,3,1515,4.353356890459364

I did get an episode 2 ""The Kill Floor"" so fortunately didn't deal with the disappointment others did with whatever purchased media they made.  I felt the chemistry between Jake and Sadie (which was crucial to King's love story part) was done well by the actors.  Most of the time, King's book adaptions get radically skewed including the endings when it comes to film/TV adaptions, but not the case here.  A few minor differences but overall, the narrative James Franco delivers, as well as Christopher Coopper's character (and again, the ever beautiful and innocent Sadie) Drives the story home.  The drama and suspense are paced very well throughout the series, giving the viewer time to learn and accept each character and their role in the story.  Yellow Card Man was extra interesting although they never mention it, rather just having the card visually in his pocket.  The best part was, where King was able to show that ""The past doesn't want to change"", in the series they are able to drive this point home several times through actions and words without repeating the statement over and over again as King seemed to.  Considering the size of the novel, I felt they did a good job with the series.  Take a step into a diner, travel through time and see if you can, or want, to change something.
