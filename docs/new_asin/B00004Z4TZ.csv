7928105,5,B00004Z4TZ,A rather intriguing storyline,1494547200,,29,6.5
7928106,4,B00004Z4TZ,"After the war has ended, Yushiro returns to Japan. He is torn between his loyalty for his family and his loyalty for his team members. He makes a discovery about himself that throws his world into chaos. Is he really Yushiro, is he really human? I sure as heck don't know. He goes on a quest to find the truth about his identity. The basis for the TA platform is also revealed. Many questions were present before, and many more have risen.

This volume started out kind of boring. The 1st episode where the team arrives in Japan and is detained kind of made me sleepy. The next 2 episodes are much better. Yoshiro starts searching for the truth about his past. I'm starting to get a little more interested in this series than I was at the beginning. My 1 major complaint is a big one though. This series seems to be focused more on a political and military conspiracy than on the characters. Most of the series so far has been spent in closed rooms watching big shots speak enigmatically about the TAs, Yoshiro, and the current political state of the world. There is a main character, Yoshiro, but he is not followed and focused on enough for the series to gain much depth. I said earlier that I'm getting more interested in this series. That is true. I am also getting frustrated with it. The mystery is intriguing, but not developing the characters any more than the writers have is kind of pissing me off. The series is half over already. If they don't develop the characters any more than this I'm afraid that I'll lose interest.",1355356800,,1533,4.475
7928107,5,B00004Z4TZ,"With this third volume Gasaraki really takes off.

I was a little worried that with the Belgistani war over Gasaraki would become aimless. Instead, it the plot is unfolding, going in directions I never suspected. Gasaraki is showing itself to be the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-Files/dp/B000BOH986/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-Files</a>&nbsp;of anime series as the plot is propelled more by men in suits, meeting in smoke filled back rooms to plot the future of the world (or at least the country) than it is by mecha battles.

This volume contained the single best episode so far (`Inferno' I think was the name) where a couple of Belgistani T.A.s infiltrate the Gowa corporation's headquarters. While it was a little funny watching a walking tank sneak through the hallways of a modern office building, if you can accept that, it was done very well, with lot of tension.

Some of the Gowa family's secrets are revealed and more questions are raised. I am very curious to see where things will go from here.",1251072000,,1057,5.393939393939394
7928108,4,B00004Z4TZ,This series has the odd effect of not making any sense but yet still compelling to watch. Although some interesting things are answered on this DVD it asks far more than it answers. But the characters are starting to get deeper and not so wooden. The conspiracies are thick and nothing is what it appears. A healthy dose of mystery wraped in a large metal skin.,1006560000,,361,4.484848484848484
7928109,5,B00004Z4TZ,"The show begins to make sense and what sense! Yushiro sees why his family is weird and how weird cannot be described here in just one review. The KUGAI rocks and there are more from what is shown and the whole imperial angle promises to be a shocker in later episodes. It makes sense from my angle anyway,the mechs look beliavable now knowing the facts. Just WATCH the show, draw your own conclusions!!",1005264000,,402,4.52054794520548
7928110,5,B00004Z4TZ,"After some complications, the TA team returns to Japan. The TA staff are put into quarentine while Gowa is held at another building. Meanwhile, Kazukiyo meets with a man who wants to change Japan in three years. While Captain Ataka sneaks out of quarentine, Symbol attempts to get back the TA sample with two Fakes. One is piloted by Miharu. The other TA pilot steels the sample while Miharu checks the data files on Yushiro. Two names come up. One is Yushiro's current status, alive and well, while the other says that Yushiro died 8 years ago. Miharu runs into Yushiro and tells him this. Filled with mixed feelings, Yushiro runs to the shrine to meet his master and find out the truth while Captain Ataka helps Misuzu (Yushiro's little sister) find him. While at the shrine, Yushiro finds bodies of those who tried to summon Gasaraki a while back and Yushiro discovers the fabled Kugai warrior. The two TA's from Symbol show up at the shrine to find more info. Miharu finds Yushiro next to the Kugai and tells him to get away. But before he can, his mind goes warped, he does the dance of Gasarak and gets inside the Kugai. An Evangelion style battle ensues and I must say that the Kugai is very impressive. It has a massive sword and even though it never gets to use it, the Kugai is still pretty cool. It rips apart the two Fakes like they're nothing. The last episode ends with the TA team trying out a new drug which drove one of the four pilots who are testing it to go insane. This volume doesn't have a lot of action, but the last episode should please everyone. If you don't understand some of the topics, the DVD includes a glossary and episode sheets to help you understand. The director interview was pretty good with discussing mecha anime, but the real treat is the behind the scenes feature. We get a 6 minute video of the dub voice actress who plays Miharu working on the show. Its very fun to watch and I hope ADV can put other voice actors on in more volumes to come. One little thing that I think is odd is that the Fakes get the spotlight on this volume and everyone calls them Beligstanian TAs. Anyway, an extremely well done DVD that will aplease any fan of the series. Get it and be amazed at its glory.",983577600,,2228,4.397094430992736
7928111,5,B00004Z4TZ,"This DVD has some extras like a cut scene from an actual dubbing booth of one of the female leads which is interesting to see how they do it. The menus are really cool as usual and this DVD contains 3 episodes. These 3 episodes contain little in the way of mech combat but we get to find out what the Gasaraki is! Let me just say that it rules. The story for this series is really starting to take shape and I think this series is going to be a classic. If you liked the first 2 DVDs or if your looking into a new series to get into after Macross and Gundam W, this is a great choice. I love this infinitely more than the Gundam series, it uses the same art house, and the guy who writes the story is the guy who wrote Patlabor, another classic anime. This DVD is superb in quality, great digital transfer and one of the few good Dub jobs out there if you want it dubbed, both are available on each DVD of course.",982713600,,913,3.9945355191256833
7928112,4,B00004Z4TZ,"I bought the first tape of that series on a whim, because I loved the desing. The characters look good and the mechas have a realistic, gritty edge to them. I was a bit dispointed by the slow pace and the cold characters but I felt the series had potential, so I kept following it.
And boy was I right! The second tape had a great story, a blend of Tom Clancy and Shinto mysticism, realistic and tension inducing. The good guys and the bad guys were not what they seemed, and the world was in constant flux.
The third tape becomes more mystical as Yoshiro, the main character, discovers that most of what he knows are lies. Faction continue to pop up and jockey for power, and you get the impression the world's going to hell. The show is very creative, you'll see TAs do things you'd never think about, and the plot moves so quickly you'll probably have to see it twice to get the nuances.
So all in all, it's great! You also get to see one of the creepiest mecha of all time...",982368000,2,979,4.240641711229946
7928113,5,B00004Z4TZ,"Impressive... As always. However i must warn you that this dvd is different from the previous ones. It has very little action ( no action scene at all in episode 9), and is more focused on the story developement. Some secrets are revealed but only to be followed by other questions, making it extremely interesting to watch, although frustrating at some points (episode 11 looks amazing but we'll have to wait 2 months...). If you' re seeking action, you definitely shoudn't buy this dvd (by the way YOU MUST watch all of the previous 7 episodes in order to fully apreciate this masterpiece), but if you like evangelion, extremely well done and interesting plot, beautifull drawing, well... then Gasaraki will be the best anime you'll ever see (the plot is even more interesting and surprising then evangelion's...). For me, best anime of the year 2000 and probably 2001. (When it came out in USA that is.)",980467200,4,906,4.814102564102564
7928114,5,B00004Z4TZ,"This is the best one yet. I can't really tell you anything about it or I would ruin it, and I am not that type of person to do that. But all I can say is wow! It takes a big turn from here in the series. Hopefully some of the fans out there will be as lucky as me to find the third one this early also. This series is great. Can't wait for the rest of the episodes.",978220800,,365,3.575
