8215227,5,B000UVV24W,"You can't go wrong with any of the 50 packs! You may get a couple of duds, but who cares! Show me a better deal! Some reviews mentioned picture or sound quality being an issue. Hey! This is before they had dolby, hi-fi and all that! I assume most of the negative reviews come from younger folks who were raised on HD TV! I haven't had any problem listening or watching any of these movies! Sure there are a few places where there might have been a film splice, or the sound may be less than 2015 standards, but it's nothing that's really going to bother anyone except for the spoiled younger generation! I own close to 20 of these 50 packs and I'm glad I bought every single one of them!",1424390400,,687,4.212121212121212
8215228,5,B000UVV24W,"Here is another good family pack from Mill Creek growing line of multi-pack movies. This is a good supplemental pack for anyone that has the Family 250 Movie Pack. You get lots of family movies not available on the 250 Family pack like Rescue From Gilligan's Island and a 22 min short called The Golf Specialist featuring the late great W.C. Fields. You get the same brilliant stars as in the 250 family pack, just a bit more of their movies and shorts. There might be a few redundant movies, but in all, most aren't available on the 250 family pack. Still, this will be great viewing for the whole family.",1391558400,,606,4.468468468468468
8215229,4,B000UVV24W,"At least a dozen of these movies are also on Comedy Kings, but this is good for smaller kids. Buy Comedy Kings if you want a better set.",1231372800,5,136,3.892857142857143
8215230,4,B000UVV24W,"The FAMILY FUN 50 MOVIE PACK has over 30 titles not issued on previous MILL CREEK box sets. Seven of these ""new releases"" star Rin Tin Tin Jr. There's also a sled dog movie here (Toby McTeague). Besides several other animal stories, included are classic literature, a condensed movie serial, an animated feature, adventure yarns, westerns and comedies. It's a nice mix of lesser-known family-geared films at a very reasonable price.
