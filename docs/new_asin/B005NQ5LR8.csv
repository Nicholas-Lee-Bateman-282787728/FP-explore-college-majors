4849264,5,B005NQ5LR8,"So Volume Two Review!
Episodes 13 - 24, ending the Galuna Island Arc and starting the Phantom Lord Arc, and the introduction of the second Dragon Slayer to the Fairy Tail universe.

The packaging is the same really as the first, As far as extras, it includes commentary on Episodes 15 and 19, the two openings and two closings so far without any text over it, and the brief trailers they had before each disc.

Episode 15 - Eternal Magic- Commentary is the Episode/Casting Director (Tyler Walker) and Gray (Newton Pittman) - This particular commentary was interesting since Newton Pittman sings a country song he wrote about Deliora.

Episode 19 - Changeling- Commentary is the Episode/Casting Director (Tyler Walker), Erza (Colleen Clinkenbeard), Happy (Tia Ballard), and Mirajane (Monica Rial)  - Turns out Monica Rial is the lead writer for the show

As a whole you can buy this alone but you will be missing the beginning of one arc and the end of the second, so I would recommend buying Part 1 before picking this up.  That being said.  I love Fairy Tail, it s a great fun series and the farther you go into the less the standard anime gimmicks are there.

4849265,5,B005NQ5LR8,"Fairy Tail, by far, is one of the best new animes to come out in years. Fairy Tail started in Japan almost a year and a half ago. Since then, it has become one of the most popular animes in Japan and America. The Story is gripping, the animation is of the highest quality of any anime going these days, And this one is almost perfect for the whole family (I say almost because in Japanese, there are a lot of boob related jokes. I know that is not everyone's cup of tea so fair warning). If you are going to buy this series though, I would highly recommend that you buy the 1st boxset first. This can be a very hard series just to jump into. But I can guarantee you, If this is a random buy, you won't be disappointed. If you are a long term fan, can you believe the 2nd boxset is all ready coming out?! I mean that is less than a month apart. I have already ordered mine. I hope this helps your decision.",1319155200,25,905,4.033333333333333

Now my wife has been pissed off at me because she didn't have a merry Christmas, but thats what I get for ordering her present at 3AM after months of asking her what she wants for Christmas, and her finally breaking down and giving me some hints one week beforehand.  Anyway, she has told me that she loves Fairy Tail, so hopefully the people that decided to keep my package are enjoying it.",1388361600,,563,4.242990654205608
4849308,5,B005NQ5LR8,"Shorter version of previous review, I am hooked on Fairy Tail and will continue to make purchases of the series with every release. The action keeps raising and I am pulled in more and more and after looking back this series has a very pleasant feel like One Piece did in that the story does have a sense of progression while not being to direct so it feels like it could last for a good long time without pulling to many stupid moves. If you enjoy a fantasy, crazy fighting and action, and a fun story then Fairy Tail is an excellent choice.",1384387200,,542,4.271844660194175

The first box set was a series on unrelated episodes that got me into the world, but on this second part, the story arcs are longer and more involved, the depth of the characters is being exposed and new villains are challenging the heroes!

4849342,5,B005NQ5LR8,"If you already watched the first season of Fairy Tail, let me assure you that the second is even better! In truth, the second season (Part 2) completes the first epic story-arc that was left open in Part 1. There is a lot more character development in this season, and the action is great, and the humor is AWESOME (trust me, you'll be laughing)!

If you have not watched the first season (Part 1), you should certainly watch that before watching Part 2. Below is my review from Part 1, which also applies to Part 2...

Are you looking for a fun, make that hilarious! and enjoyable cartoon series that does not take itself too seriously, but is not overly childish? This may be what you're looking for!

***This Review is Spoiler Free, and covers the First Two Seasons (Parts 1 and 2)***

""Fairy Tail"", is based on a Japanese comic book (manga) series, which is based on Japanese role-playing games (JRPGs). Basically, watching Fairy Tail is like watching a JRPG. If you have not played any JRPGs, then you should know that all RPGs are more or less based on Dungeons and Dragons. In other words, Fairy Tail is in principle a fantasy world filled with magic, dragons, and all that jazz. It is NOT Tolkien, so don't expect Lord of the Rings. This series was not created primarily with adults in mind. It was created so that adults could enjoy it, but it's most definitely meant for teenagers. That said, I'm far past my teens and I very much enjoyed this series. I admit that I am a fan of animation, however I am NOT an Anime (Japanese animation) fan. Which is not to say I don't like Anime, I simply don't watch that much Anime. I want to point that out, since I believe this is a series that even people who are not Anime fanatics can still appreciate and really enjoy.

So then, what to expect? Fairy Tail has a number of main characters which I describe below. Note that I will be using the American names, since I only watched the English dub, which I will talk about later. First, the principle players:

Lucy: she is your ""typical"" adolescent guy's dream. In other words, she is blonde, blue-eyed, big boobs, and is a schoolgirl. Yeah, so clearly she ""appeals"" to more than just adolescents. Anyway, Lucy also displays other traits common in Japanese Anime and RPGs, meaning she wears form-revealing clothes, get's captured now and then, and cries now and then. She may not sound very original, and in many ways she is not, however she is actually fairly endering and also quite funny. Fortunately, as the series progresses, she also becomes stronger, more confident, and fights more. She has the ability to summon spirits to her aid, and the spirits are very funny! For example, she can summon a Minotaur that is completely infatuated with her (and is quite open about it)!

Natsu: Natsu got rejected from Dragonball, and thus found a job in Fairy Tail. Seriously, if you thought Lucy was generic, wait until you see Natsu! Spiky hair? check. Rebellious attitude? check. Heart of gold? check. Just wants to eat and fight? check. I personally find him the most boring character. That said, he does have his moments, and I find that as things progress he is more tolerable. If I were a really young kid, I would definitely admire Natsu. However, I'm not a really young kid, and I find Natsu a bit cliche. Fortunately he has quite a few funny moments, many due to Erza and Happy.

Happy: Happy is a blue cat. That talks. And can fly. Happy is awesome. He's basically a narrator of sorts (although Fairy Tail has an actual narrator as well) that often helps out the team and is hilarious and cute. He sticks with Natsu, and is far more entertaining in my opinion. This cat has spunk!

Erza: she's your typical beautiful girl-next-door who could beat you to a pulp without breaking a sweat. Although her character is very serious, often when she's around funny things happen. Many people are scared of her, because she is serious and pushes herself and others to the limit (and can beat most anyone to a pulp), and this often leads to wonderfully comedic situations. As you find out later in the series, she like everyone else, has secrets and her own daemons to overcome. Erza is a favorite for many, and for good reasons.

Gray: well, he's a lot like Natsu, but more quiet and thoughtful. Thus, less annoying at times. Still, he is stereotypical in that he gets hit a billion times and then gets up saying ""ouch, ouch, OK, I'll get you!"" [I paraphrase]. Natsu is a fire wizard, and Gray is an ice wizard, so obviously they get into fights... but fortunately Erza is there to keep these guys on the straight path.

So, the aforementioned are the main characters, but the supporting cast is actually fantastic! One of the great things about this series is that the supporting cast really do play an important role. They are not just there to go on errands for the main characters, but really move the plot forward and show character development. That is one of the great things about this series, there is substantial character development... although Natsu has not developed too much yet, but the series is still young! Anyway, Natsu and all, the characters really mesh beautifully. The stories are often very humorous, and there's enough action to keep things entertaining and fresh.

Animation Style: this animation style is very similar to the manga, with characters showing exaggerated expressions etc. I'm not a huge fan of this style, but for this particular series it fits perfectly. I don't think the animation is as beautiful as some other animated series I have seen. In my opinion it's not as stylistically beautiful as Batman the Animated Series, nor is it anywhere as majestic as the classic Disney or Studio Ghibli films. That said, the animation does the job and at times can be beautiful. Also, the animation is mostly hand-drawn, with some computer animations. I much prefer hand-drawn animation, and fortunately the computer animation is not overly used (all the spells are computer generated).

Music: The opening and closing tracks can be both addictive and annoying at the same time. That said, all the music throughout the series is good. I don't find it particularly memorable, and I have no interest in purchasing the soundtrack, but it fits the bill perfectly. What does the music sound like? Honestly, it sounds like a JRPG (not a surprise).

Story: the plots may be nothing new (good vs. evil...characters with hidden secrets...dragons, magic,...save the city/world...) but you will love how the characters interact, and how they grow and develop! There's romance, mystery, and LOTS and LOTS of hilarious mayhem! This series is basically a fantasy/comedy, and very well done. There is NO nudity nor gruesome violence (I have seen zero blood in this series). It is 100% (well, at least 90%) kid friendly. Of course a young kid will not understand everything that's happening, but I think they would still find it entertaining. Still, I feel this series was made for older kids, including the kid that all adults still have somewhere deep down!

***What's GOOD***
+++Great storytelling! Good pace! Often very very funny!
+++The interaction between all the characters is charming and hilarious!
+++World is dynamic, so characters will change, and the story will progress!
+++Characters do develop (well, most do)!
+++Excellent English cast! I haven't heard the Japanese (it's available if you want it), but I'm super pleased with the English dub.

***What's Bad***
-characters can be generic/cliche (""oh hey, you've got an evil grin and harsh laugh...gee, guess you are evil"")
-you get 4 discs! BUT this is a DVD/blu ray set, so if you want just blu ray, guess what... you're also paying for the DVDs anyway!
-very few extras. I don't consider this terrible, but if you're someone that really likes extras in a set, you will be disappointed.
-the episodes are short, so you will be seeing the opening and ending credits A LOT!

OVERALL: I really have enjoyed the Fairy Tail sets. This is the most enjoyable Anime experience I have had in years. Mostly, this is due to the hilarious nature of the series. If you're an Anime fan and/or JRPG fan, you should not hesitate to get this. If you're like me, and want to give something new a chance, I would recommend purchasing both the first and second season, since they form a continuous arc. Chances are you won't be disappointed. Also, the second season is much better than the first, but remember that the first season is more or less to introduce the characters. I look forward to seeing the remaining series as they are released. As I said in the beginning, this is an excellent series if you know what to expect: a light-hearted action/fantasy series with romance and lots of humor! Happy says ""Aye!""",1356912000,,8779,4.734947643979058

An evil wizard is resurrecting a monster that will destroy the world. The monster has a connection to Gray's past and stirs lots of anger and sorrow within him. We also find out why he's always hanging around in his underwear all the time. Later in this volume Lucy is kidnapped by the element 4 sorcerers and a huge battle erupts trying to save her.

This volume picks up where the 1st left off. It's a lot of fun. If you liked part 1 you'll like part 2. Enjoy!",1350172800,,581,4.1875

Basically if you are looking for a great comedy with loveable character, fast action, and a low rate of sadness this is for you.

One thing that wasn't clear when I bought this was that there are 4 disc but 2 of them are in English and 2 are in Japanese. There are only 12 episodes in one language and they are the same episodes in both languages. Not to mention that it cuts off in a terrible spot.",1333929600,,568,4.7272727272727275

4849353,5,B005NQ5LR8,"An excellent series. Well written characters, thought out story, even the 'filler-arcs' (story arcs added to let the manga artist get the next story arc set up) are very well done.

Only complaint is the $50 msrp (I got it on sale) for 12 episodes. Not the worst pricing ever but still unnecessarily high.",1327968000,,305,4.648148148148148
4849354,2,B005NQ5LR8,"This series about a guild of magicians, set in a magical, whimsical world of evil-doers and magic powers is watchable, but nothing to really write home about. What does it do well? It is your classic ""shonen"" type anime series with some cute girls, boisterous male leads, and battle featuring some pretty cool powers. You have the classic elemental powers in the mix with Natsu (fire) Grey (Ice) and Lucy to add the expected cuteness and fan-service. However well intentions were with this series it falls way short of being great. The sound track is generic (in comparison to a show like Darker than Black who got the legendary Yoko Kanno (cowboy bebop) to do theirs) and predictable fight scenes. Ill say this... imagine ""Bleach"" but with castles, armor and Magicians instead of Hollows, the Soul Society and soul reapers. This pretty much sums it up. Tite Kubo did this concept YEARS before Mashima did in Fairy Tail (and it wasn't all that original when Kubo did it either). It sadly cannot compare to to other recent hits like Death Note, Darker than Black, Baccano! or even the similar-plotted Bleach. Bleach basically does what Fairy Tail does but better. To sum up...good, watchable, but definitely nothing new, exciting or notable here. Plot is linear and predictable, the fights are well written but not spectacular and the art is *meh*. Mediocre overall. On a side note I met Hiro Mashima at NYCC 2011 and he was a really kind personable man.",1327363200,3,1453,4.816
4849355,5,B005NQ5LR8,"Ok Fairy Tail is really impressive with how they've dubbed the cast, and I'm even more happy since the people who play Gajeel and Juvia sound perfect! My favorite episode would have to be Changeling but I'm not giving any spoilers on what happens! :P

8480695,5,B005NQ5LR8,"Fairy Tail Part 2 picks up from a cliff hanger. If you recall, Gray had just gotten his butt kicked by Lyon- his former classmate in the previous episode. Natsu (who is frozen at this time due to Lyon's air-freeze), eventually finds Gray, and takes him back to the village.

Long story short, Lucy, Gray, and Natsu are reunitied at the village. However, they can't seem the catch a break! Lyon's kronies- who have been ordered to wipe out the village for getting in the way of his dastardly plans, go on the offensive and attack the village. Gray- too wounded to fight is carried off by the villagers to a temporary base in the forest, while Natsu is left to fight Toby and Yuka. At the same time, Lucy is seperated, and is forced to take on Sherry Blendi by herself.

I'm not going to spoil fights, but later on in the arc, Erza DOES show up on the island. She is faced with a choice: she can follow her master's orders to the letter, and take the three juvenile Fairy Tail wizards home, or stay with them to finish the S class quest. Chosing the later, Erza stays and helps, but actually only spectates from the sidelines for the most part. Later on, with his wounds healed, Gray is left to fight his long-life rival in a desperate rematch. With his magic nearly gone, Gray sparrs with Lyon in a fist fight that turns into a desperate magic struggle to save the island from the resurrection of Deliora. The outcome can only be found out by the buying the discs!

However, Galuna Island isn't the only action that happens in this part- When everyne finally gets back to the mainland, they are greeted by quite a nasty suprise: that being a TRASHED guildhall!
Apparently, right before they got back home, Fairy Tail was attacked- the hall is ravashed by massive iron rods sticking out from every yard. With the hall trashed, all of the members had taken shelter in the basement.
When the Strongest Team arrives in the basement of the guildhall, they are greated by their desparing guildmates. Master Makarov breifs them in the recent trouble: apparently Fairy Tail's rival guild was thought to be behind this attack: Phantom Lord.

However, Makarov is not yet willing to counterattack the Phantom Lord guild. War between guilds is forbidden by the Magic council. This changes soon though. That very night, Team Shadow Gear is ambushed on their way home. Their uncounscious bodies are found pinned up to a tree in the Magnolia park.

That is the last straw. With no patience for the harming of his children, Makarov mobilizies his guild for an all out attack out Phantom Lord's main guild hall in Oak Town. This 9 episode arc is full of suprises, and all out war- a war that is all linked to Lucy. Witness Natsu take on an S-Class fire wizard, and Elfman Take on an S-Class earth wizard, but saving the best for last: Get part 2 to watch The Fire Dragon vs The Iron Dragon Slayer in the episode ""Lucy Heartfilia"".
