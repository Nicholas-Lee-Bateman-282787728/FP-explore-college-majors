4509817,5,B004ZKKL3W,My son loves this series and this was shipped fast. No issues with quality. Great distraction for when you are traveling,1353974400,,120,4.761904761904762
4509818,4,B004ZKKL3W,"My boys have actually never seen Beyblade before but have been getting into anime shows lately.  This DVD contains seven episodes involving Gingka and his friends battling each other for a chance to compete in the greatest battle ever, Battle Bladers to become the country's #1 Beybladder.

Episodes:
* The Fearsome Libra
* The Road to the Battle Bladers
* The Beuatiful Eagle
* The Sniper, Capricorn
* Tsubasa Flies into the Dark
* Intruders in the Challenge Match!
* Dark Gasher's Big, Crabby-Crabby Operation!

Even though my boys have never seen the show, or the first three volume DVDs, they didn't seem to mind and picked right into it.  While I don't like the show or get it, the characters intrigue my boys.  Luckily there really isn't fighting, they actually use spinning tops but there are of course bad guys.  The show is probably geared more towards pre-teen boys and with 154 minutes of running time it can really keep kids busy!",1314489600,,942,4.748466257668712
