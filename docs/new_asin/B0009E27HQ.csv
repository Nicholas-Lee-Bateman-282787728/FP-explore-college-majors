8200489,5,B0009E27HQ,"This was Kiefer Sutherland's first major role in a motion picture. He was nominated for a Genie Award (Canada's Academy Awards) for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for his work in The Bay Boy. He had previously appeared in Max Dugan Returns, but if you blinked at the wrong moment, you missed him.

The Bay Boy is set in depression era Nova Scotia. It depicts a brutal existence, in which Kiefer's character, Donald Campbell (ironic that his first role would bear his father's name) is coming of age. Donald maintains a youthful optimism despite the hardships his family endures, and Mr. Sutherland's performance shows a stunning natural talent and a maturity far beyond his years. Watching this film, it is difficult to understand why his talent was squandered by the industry for so long. During the time between his early success in Stand By Me, The Lost Boys, the Young Guns movies and Flatliners until his success in 24, I would have said that he was probably the most underrated working (or not) actor.

If you appreciate Mr. Sutherland's tremendous talent, and you are in the mood for a gritty slice of life, I highly recommend this film. Liv Ullman is of course, superb, and the two actors together have a wonderful chemistry as mother and son. It's a shame this film isn't more readily available.",1461283200,,1320,4.734782608695652
