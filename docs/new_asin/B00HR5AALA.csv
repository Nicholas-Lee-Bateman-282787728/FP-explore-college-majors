8634662,3,B00HR5AALA,At the end of this DVD you really don't feel like you learned that much about Josephine at all. So the search was fairly fruitless. More about Napoleon than Josephine. All they really say is she followed him around Europe and didn't always like it. Doesn't even explore the relationship that she had with her children and after Napoleon divorced her it quickly ends. Terrible actors used to represent Josephine and Napoleon from the ages of 35 and 28 respectively. The woman looks in her fifties and is quite stout and the man just looks old...its quite distracting. Not at all like the excellent David Grubin  documentary of Marie Antoinette which explored his subject matter thoroughly and made you feel sympathy for the subject. This documentary was simply bland,1404432000,2,765,4.930232558139535
