3996180,2,B002VJ05C6,"I would love to give this a good review but seeing as the one cardio workout on the disc won't load, I won't be able to. I do like the two sculpting workouts for abs and buns and thighs but the exercises are very simimlar to the original Winsor Pilates video.",1287792000,,259,4.098039215686274
3996181,3,B002VJ05C6,"The other reviewers are pretty spot-on.  The ""Express"" workout is really basic and boring.  This was my first experience with Pilates, but I quickly became bored with the lengthy explanations and slow pace after one or two viewings.  The workout does challenge the muscles, especially abs, that I'm not accustomed to using, but overall isn't very difficult.

The ""Quick Fix"" workout, which focuses on cardio, seems like it has a lot of potential but I don't really see the benefit of a twelve-minute cardio workout with long warm-up and cool-down.  I didn't feel much burn during or after.

However, I. LOVE. the lower body mat workout.  It really zones in on your legs and butt in a short amount of time and I always feel the burn by the end.  After doing this workout about three or four times a week for just over two weeks (combined with running), my legs already feel stronger - I keep finding new muscles in my thighs by surprise!

If you're a pilates beginner and want to get familiar with the form, breathing, etc., this might be a good place to start.  However, if you know your way around the mat already, I'm sure there are better, more challenging videos out there.",1274400000,11,1177,4.615384615384615
3996182,4,B002VJ05C6,"I agree with the previous reviewer that two outta three workouts are great.  Well worth the purchase.  The Cardio and Lower body firm and burn I use regularly now.

The other one there is toooo much talking but for someone who has not done pilates before it would be a great beginner to walk you through how to do it correctly for maximum benefits.",1273968000,3,348,4.40625
3996183,1,B002VJ05C6,"I didn't care for this video at all. The Pilates Express Workout was just like the Winsor Pilates DVD I bought years ago of her infomercial. I was very disappointed. She also talks way too much and a lot of the time is spent taking about the correct positions.

And cadio?? What cardio?? The only exercise that even had cardio was the Quick Fix Pilates Workout.

I was looking for a challenge and this definitely wasn't it.",1268697600,7,423,4.48051948051948
3996184,3,B002VJ05C6,"First let me start by saying that I own EVERY SINGLE Mari Winsor Pilates DVD ever made. I am not kidding here folks! I love Mari Winsor and her technique.

Now, on to the DVD:

The workout with the actual CARDIO Pilates is a good workout, I really enjoyed it.  The workout for the lower body was a great one too! Nice-n-fast and to the point.  However, the workout on the mat (no cardio) was down-right BORING.  Mari talks and talks and talks about her technique and has you 'test' it, etc.  I thought that after ALL her DVD's that are out, by this point, she wouldn't need to explain every single movement. I thought this WHOLE ENTIRE DVD would be fast paced, but not that 3rd workout.  I can't stand it when she has you get into position AND THEN explains the technique while you're sitting there in mid air.  So annoying.  But Mari only does this with the 3rd workout.

Now, if you are NEW to Pilates, yes, that workout would be perfect for you, but I assumed that since the DVD is Cardio Pilates, that the whole thing would be fast paced. I was wrong.

I will never do that 3rd workout again, but I will do the other 2.

All in all, it was worth the purchase.

Side note:  I purchased this DVD on eBay before it was even released (hence my review before the release date).",1266883200,63,1276,4.240663900414938

3996190,2,B002VJ05C6,"If you're new to pilates, this would be probably be fine to learn the basics and techniques, but you'd surely grow out of this video quickly and want to move on.  It's annoying that she makes you wait to perform the exercise while she explains technique step by step on the ""express workout"".  You barely get in any moves in 25 minutes, because all she's doing is talking.  If you have a Windsor workout, you know what you're doing.
 I also hate laying on my back with my legs up in the air waiting, while she gives instructions to the modified exercise first.  It's just too simplistic of a video for me personally.  The moves are basic.  Also, the cardio part has some pretty awkward moves, especially while standing on one foot, yet she doesn't explain those moves very well!?
I'll stick to her accelerated pilates dvd until i can find another one I like!",1403049600,2,858,4.496774193548387
3996191,3,B002VJ05C6,"I already own Winsor's 20 minute and accelerated Pilates DVDs. This routine is virtually the same as the 20-minute video,  and definitely not fast enough to be considered cardio. Disappointed in Mari with this one, and won't buy any more of her programs, since I expect different routines,  not the same under different names.",1400025600,,326,5.018518518518518
3996192,3,B002VJ05C6,"Let me start out by saying I love Mari Winsor Pilates, I have almost every workout DVD of hers. I just thought by now she would have a more advanced one like I was hoping this one would be where she doesn't explain every single move in detail while your holding a position waiting to get going. We know how to do the moves by now lets just have a fast paced workout where your actually getting some cardio. She has the best moves and is the best instructor but we need some advanced with no very minimal talking and explaining. I hope so bad she comes out with something like that soon. This is a great workout for beginners just starting out with pilates.",1388448000,,656,4.256
3996193,4,B002VJ05C6,"I like Mari Winsor - especially if you are new to Pilates - she gives instructions and explanations. also, she also gives modifications for those who need them. and you do feel you get stronger and more fit if you do them regularly!",1387065600,,232,4.4186046511627906
3996194,2,B002VJ05C6,"Not very challenging, even combining all workouts it's not what I call Cardio.
There are better workouts that challenges the core, focuses on posture and form and include cardio such as the New York City Ballet workout.
These are more like express workouts, pilates if you only have 15 minutes, rather than Cardio Pilates. This video fails at both.

I give it two stars because it has decent production value and it's better than nothing. Plus Mari Winsor gives a lot of good advice for good posture and form.",1384128000,,509,4.719101123595506

3996199,3,B002VJ05C6,"The video has 3 segments of exercise. The first one is a 25 minute ""cardio"" that in reality could put you to sleep. If you ever did the 20 minute WIndsor Pilates this is half of that is more time. The next two videos are good, but they are only 12-13 minutes a piece. So you are really only getting 25 minutes of real exercise on this DVD in whole.",1372464000,,348,3.9857142857142858
3996200,2,B002VJ05C6,"I own the Winsor Pilates Basic 3 DVD Workout Set and after years of not working out am addicted to Pilates. Mari Winsor is amazing and I am well on my way because of her DVDs.

I bought this Cardio Pilates because I wanted to add some cardio to my regime. This DVD was so disappointing for a number of reasons: the routines did not match the rhythm of the music; and the music was just odd in general. The cardio portion was only 10 minutes long; and the flow of exercises was choppy. There was way too much instruction in the Pilates workout. The moves and routine from the cardio portion was reminiscent of a late 80's exercise video. In short, it was corny and I don't think it has anything to do with Mari. I've purchased a few Gaiam DVDs and they are all slow moving, with poor music and a lot of Jane Fonda like moves and routines. I think it's just bad production and planning taking a fall back position on stuff that' already been done - like 20 years ago...

Here's my 2 cents...  If you want an amazing Pilates workout get Mari Winsors Basic 3 DVD Workout Set. If you want to add cardio to your routine walk, skip, run stairs - just move at least 4 times per week for 30 minutes. If you want retro exercise tapes buy anything Gaiam.

Also, the cover picture is misleading because she doesn't do that exercise.  This is, I guess, an introductory course that contains a good bit of instruction, which is boring and wastes time if you are an advanced pilates student.",1356652800,,373,4.8125

The first section is too lengthy for an explanation on how to do Pilates.  I found that Mari devotes too much time describing how  ""Missy"" will do the excercises to avoid danger and pain.  Missy was also in the Pilates in Pink Video and again it was a little too time consuming.  Perhaps Mari should make a more advanced tape for people who need the burn and a more demanding workout.
I am planning to modify this workout with my regular LA Fitness Pilates workout to increase the level of this workout.  Atleast it is giving me some direction into completing a workout by myself.",1303516800,,967,6.634920634920635

(and it was not for me either).The standing cardio segment in this DVD is a mere fraction of the whole and it is stuck between two other very, very, very traditional Winsor pilates mat workouts which are neat and well explained but frankly, quite repetitive and boring. You cannot escape the bore even if you combine the three workouts in a different order, since the two mat workouts are much about the same exercises (the biggest difference is in the instructors' clothing and you end up feeling you are always doing the same stuff).From an authority like Mary Winsor I had expected something fresher and, actually, just a little bit more cardio, given the title.",1291507200,,757,4.6992481203007515
