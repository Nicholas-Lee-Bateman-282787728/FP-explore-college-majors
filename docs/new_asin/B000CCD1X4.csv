2457006,5,B000CCD1X4,"Just saw this film a short while ago, and was floored at how good it was.  The documentary does very nicely at showing individual stories on how Argentinians are suffering from their economic crisis and their feeling of helplessness with their current political system and their unique ways of dealing with these problems.  And yet it balances these stories with larger scoped contexts of a given factory that they follow closely and how that fits in the larger context of how similar events are happening all over the country, and how it related to the election that was happening at the time the film was shot.  Film was nicely edited both stylistically and in pacing and guides you to a climax that didn't have to rely on ""borrowed"" footage like many other documentaries do, but uses pretty much all its own 16 member crew's footage that wasn't in any way tame or irrelavent as a result.
I think it's very relavent for many democracies now, especially us who've been disappointed in our erosion of democracy here in the States.  We see both clearly a vision of where we could be headed, and also strongly the message that a democracy depends very much on a grass roots efforts by its citizens to make it work and that we as citizens of one shouldn't be thinking that ""someone else will deal with it."".  I highly recommend these folks' work.  They put their heart and soul into it and you can tell.
Also included are two shorts that discuss how the movie was made behind the scenes, and one that appears to be dedicated to a subplot that was likely cut from the main film that goes in fairly deep to the events around a protestor who had been killed in one of these protests.",1107561600,,1677,4.5364238410596025
2457007,5,B000CCD1X4,"I have long been an advocate of workers self-management and socialism from below. This is the best documentary available to see these ideals, not just theorized on paper, but in actions executed by ordinary people. The most inspiring aspect of this dvd is that the workers created the entire movement. Free of a vanguard or liberal reformers. This was direct democracy in it's purest and most beautiful.

The film is a wonderful exhibit of what community based grassroots activism can accomplish. You see more than the inner workings of recovered factories but also root causes of the economic stagnation and unemployment, the links between workers and the rest of the community and the never ending war between the leaders of the expropriations and the former factory owners. You get the sense that all these things are intimately related through a complex political economy that fails to serve the people.

The film was slanted against the IMF and the rest of the unholy trinity but I would say the near unanimous blame of the IMF by the Argentine people warrants such a view. Despite this slant time is given to leading businessmen and neo-liberals to defend their stances and explain their positions. All in all it's a great way to look inside the world of direct democracy and what societies could look like in a decentralized, cooperative nation. Bravo!",1225584000,,1359,4.956140350877193
2457008,2,B000CCD1X4,"I like the story that this film tells about the workers of the closed factories trying to bring Argentina back from the brink by getting back to work.  I believe that recuperation is a fair way to settle owed wages, satisfy the other creditors and provide productive work.  I think its a shame that the politicians would do anything but fully support the workers' endeavors in getting the economy moving again.

Despite this, the film is ruined by half-baked ideas about the IMF and the Multi-nationals causing the ruin of the Argentine economy.  The IMF is the only organization in the world that continued to provide hard currency to the Argentine government after the economic crisis.  The Multinational corporations only did what they could to try to mitigate their losses caused by the collapse by getting the hell out of Dodge.

The true culprits in the plot are the corrupt politicians and the nefarious bigwigs running the local enterprises like Forja San Martin. (Am I the only one who noticed that the film includes no examples of Multinationals abandoning a factory?)  Argentina had crappy fiscal and monetary policies, including bloated subsidies to companies like Zanon (before the take-over), and a pegged currency.  The references to IMF policy prescriptions (El Modelo) never mention that Argentina ignored the most basic reforms that are supposed to ensure stability and solvency of the government and support economic development while helping those hurt by the attendant dislocations that development will cause (i.e.: job loss, etc.)  I don't know why they were so timid about calling out these scoundrels, other than that they'd have to pass up taking cheaps shots at the IMF, Multinational corporations, and other globalization bogeymen.

I would have appreciated this film much more if it were more honest about the true circumstances that lead to the sad state of affairs that it documents.  I would have rated it at least four stars had it done so.

If you disagree with my review, I'd appreciate some feedback in a comment. Since I posted this review, I've only gotten ""unhelpful"" votes, but no constructive feedback.  It's rather frustrating, as I feel I gave this film and its argument quite a bit of thought and additional research before giving it a marginally unfavorable rating.",1210723200,17,2322,5.078947368421052
2457009,5,B000CCD1X4,"Scripted by activist-author Naomi Klein (""No Logo"") and directed by Avi Lewis, ""The Take"" is a probing look at the ugly underside of globalization and its discontents, as well as a compelling portrait of blue-collar pride and self-esteem. We get to know the workers and their families, hearing about the hardships so many have endured since an ill-advised International Monetary Fund bailout plunged Argentina deeper into debt and disarray. Urgent and damning in its implications, ""The Take"" is a David and Goliath story with real-world reverberations.",1185753600,2,552,5.430232558139535
2457010,5,B000CCD1X4,"Using the recuperated Forja factory as a microcosm of the larger Argentine piquetero movement, author Naomi Klein and director Avi Lewis have done a brilliant job documenting the grassroots activism of marginalized workers in the wake of Argentina's dramatic economic collapse caused by years of IMF/World Bank structural adjustment programs and the corrupt presidency of Carlos Menem. Faced with abject poverty and state repression, the unemployed auto-parts workers of the Forja factory have occupied their abandoned workplace and transformed it into a successful cooperative, proving thus the power of labor solidarity. As such, the Forja factory, like all the recuperated factories, neighborhood assemblies, and independent media collectives in Argentina, provides an inspirational example of direct democracy, participatory economics, and horizontal social organizing. Besides being an important film politically, as a work of art it is simply exquisite. Fans of Mercedes Sosa will especially be moved by the protest scenes that were put to her music!",1173484800,7,1056,5.819354838709677
2457011,4,B000CCD1X4,"Overall, this is a moving film. As an anthropology instructor, I've shown it several times and evoking a largely sympathetic audience. Currently I'm writing a paper on the process of recuperacion, and this seems to be potentially one alternative model to the destructive policies of transnational corporations, their agencies, and the neoliberal ideology they espouse.

That said, there is one serious problem in their choice of a case study that runs throughout the film; the auto parts manufacturer Forja San Martin (Forja). It's a very moving portrait of Freddy Espinoza, one of the leaders of the cooperative taking over the shutdown factory. Lalo, the coordnator representing the national organization for recovered factories, seems to be a likable guy. We see the leaders trying to work out a deal with a tractor factory.

This image breaks down, however, when we learn from Andres Ruggeri in his ""Worker Recovered Enterprises in Argentina"" that the backslider depicted in the film, the one who supports Menem in the 2003 election, has taken over the leadership of Forja San Martin, that the others portrayed in the film have been expelled from the factory and cooperative, and that the deal with the tractor factory--Zanello by name--has fallen through.

Even worse, we find from Zachary Fields in his unpublished paper ""A Conservative, Middle Aged Revolution,"" that Forja is producing way below capacity, that it cannot add new technology because banks refuse them credit (private lenders hate all recovered factory cooperatives), and that it cannot make any investments until they deliver to their customers, who often furnish Forja the raw materials. Forja, in short, is not doing well.

Zanon and Brukman seem to fare better when it comes to accurate representation. One thing that they seem to be doing right is maintaining strong bonds with their neighborhoods and community, a deficit of Forja according to Ruggeri, and of many other recovered organizations.

Another issue is worker commitment to change. According to Andres Gaudin, many, if most, workers of recovered factories lack a sense of political ideology or commitment; they just want to get their wages and go home. In fact, says Ruggeri, many workers are in the enterprises because they have nowhere else to go.

Despite these reservations, The Take is on to something interesting. For one, Ruggeri points out that despite the miniscule number of recovered factories (0.08% of all such operations) and low number of workers, they have stabilized. In an hostile environment--no credit, stringent legal constraints, competitive economy, constant threats of evictions, and uncertain policies of the Kirchner government--this is an accomplishment in its own right.

The movement has spread to Brazil, Uruguay, Panama--and Venezuela, where the first conference on recovered facories was held. Venezuela is looking at 700 factories for possible recovery, and a paper mill, an aluminum company, and a valve manufacturer were featured at the conference.

Let's hope that the factory recovery movement is embryonic of the future; and I hope the couple comes back to film or otherwise provide an update of the situation in Argentina. It would also be nice to know how the rcovery movement is doing in other countries--especially Venezuela.",1159315200,35,3305,5.318007662835249
2457012,5,B000CCD1X4,"Due to globalization, Argentina economy has been devastated. The workers, with no ideology take control of closed factories just so they can work again and try to get by. I found it disturbing how much a similar story of what is going on in their government and ours. And their people have the same short memory as we seem to have. They almost re-elected the same Bozo (former President Carlos Menem) that hurt them in the first place. Fortunately, an event happened to jog their collective memory.

It upsets me watching smug politicians and rich jerks destroy a country.",1155427200,,572,4.777777777777778

It is structured very well, and I need to mention the editing, music, photography are all excellent. The actual lives of actual people and their struggles are well conveyed to me. Since I know nothing about the country except that I have several friends who are from the country, I want to be careful try not to conclude that what is described is actual Argentina.",1153612800,2,493,4.488888888888889
2457014,4,B000CCD1X4,"Naomi Klein and Avis Lewis's audiovisual manifesto is less intellectual and powerful than No Logo's Klein, but it has the virtue to convey the main thesis Klein claimed in that book and goes further here in order to show a proper alternative politics to counterbalance the unjustice and ""natural"" evolution of Capitalism. Of course, what it's shown in The Take is not enough, but it's a starting point. The whole point here is how Argentineans workers, after being perplexed and helpless when different factories close down, take the factories and recuperate them, showing how they can be still productive. (Zanon, Forja San Martn, almost 200 hundred cases are shown here). Of course, and Lewis and Klein pointed out, the way chosen by workers is could be called stealing, although there is another way of signifying: expropriation. What's behind is an old Marxist concept: the ownership of the means of production, and by extension, a criticism against private property. Argentina, an IMF symbol of how its economical norms and regulations should be followed became its rebuttal when in 2001 the whole economical life brokedown and collapsed. This is the context of the film and its universality matches with the planetary political zeitgeist of the new millennium: antiglobalization, that diffuse movement which goes beyond class struggle. Perhaps, The take is a little bit naive when one thinks this exercise of resistance in a big picture of global politics, but its authenticity is inspiring, a case of hope whose main case is to open up a practice of radical democracy.",1152403200,2,1575,5.132295719844358
2457015,5,B000CCD1X4,"This documentaty is a moving account of what happens to good hard-working people who are deprived of their right to work. It is also a study in the best strategy we have against globalization, and that is cooperatives. During the documentary, you spend time with a group of former autoparts factory workers as they wrestle their way though political and legal battles in order to regain their abandoned factory. You see what work means to these men, to their pride and their self-esteem. The documentary interweaves their stories with the story of another successful worker's cooperative and with an historical overview of the political leaders in Argentina who created this situation. I highly recommend this film. It was entertaining and informative.",1145232000,2,752,5.223140495867769

8097240,5,B000CCD1X4,"Unemployed auto-parts workers walk back into their idled factory (closed due to globalization) and eventually succeed in taking over and restoring their jobs. This documentary attacks the IMF and those following its dictums that have brought profits to Wall Street and emptiness to Main Street - around the world. Turns out they're not the only ones - the workers argue that the factories had been subsidized by public money, and that now the workers deserve a chance if the owners no longer want this. (Owners, of course, see this differently, calling it theft.) Many of the factories reopened and were able to turn a profit. Come the 2001 economic crisis and elections, the IMF-following politicians were turned out.

At Zanon Ceramics, the first 'expropriated' factory, 240 workers resumed production in March, 2002 - without Zanon management supervision. By 2005, over 170 new workers had been hired, bringing the total to 410. The Zanon recovery was hindered by paying full price for utilities, vs. the prior owner paying only 20%. In 2012, the factory was still in operation.

8097245,4,B000CCD1X4,"This fascinating documentary details the struggle of the workers of one closed car parts factory in Argentina to reopen under worker control.  I was impressed at the tight narrative of the documentary and with Naomi Klein's skills  as a documentary writer.  The suspense never let up for a moment and I was on the edge of my seat.  Watching the movie felt more like a thriller than a regular documentary.  Hopefully Klein and Avi Lewis will make more movies, as this one shows they can produce a fully absorbing story.

The story is about workers taking over their plant to produce again, against the backdrop of forced austerity.  As the narration says, Argentina is not a poor country but a rich country made poor.  The focus is on the human drama of the workers, although the frame is always about creating a fairer economy for the 99%.  (The term wasn't around then, but they would have used it if it were.)

One problem with the film is that it shows Juan Peron as a sort of uncomplicated great guy.  That part of Argentine history is a bit more complex than you'd guess from the film.

Included are a more meandering documentary on the making of the film, emphasizing the tension between the collective process of the film crew and the need for the director to have his own vision.  There is also an excellent short film ""Gustavo Benedetto: Presente!"" that gives the story of one Argentinian who was shot in the back by the police or a security guard.  This film gives a sense of the lives of the protestors and the difficulty in moving beyond the terror of the years of military occupation.

This documentary should find a wide audience.",1327276800,,1644,4.601374570446735

8097247,5,B000CCD1X4,"Reflections on ""The Take""  J. Alexander

I've seen this film a few times now and it remains inspiring on repeated viewings, as do the bonus features included on the disc. Not just a microcosm of the effects of globalization in Latin America, this film is a microcosm of globalism everywhere in the world and how ordinary people can overcome the extraordinary corruption and exploitation institutionalized throughout the world economy of, by, and for the corporate elitist bankers, investors, and politicians. As is said toward the end of the film, ""We [Argentina] are the mirror to look into, the mistake to avoid. Argentina is the waste that remains of a globalized country. We are where the rest of the world is going.""

In the 1990s under President Menem and the direction of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), social services in Argentina were reduced, whole industries were sold off to foreign firms, and backroom deals were made, guaranteed to benefit the international elites and corrupt politicians when the well ran dry from being over bled by `pigs on the wing'. No other outcome was possible, and no other outcome has ever ultimately resulted. To profit under capitalism, corporations must create scarcity (by limiting supply) on the one hand, and an unlimited supply of cheap labor on the other. So when they were unable to do this in Argentina (due to worker demands and depressed global demand), they decided to remove all liquid capital from the Argentine economy and liquidate factories and equipment as quickly as possible.

Many workers, however, though `free to starve,' chose, rather, to take their right-to-life seriously by seizing their means of earning a living. Though non-ideological, they naturally and un-self-consciously embarked on an anarcho-syndicalist adventure not unlike the kibbutzim (collective farms) of Israel.

To succeed, they had to work with the corrupt system and politicians still entrenched in their country. But most of them apparently could see that putting the factories back to work was in the interests of the whole country. Where the workers have had the toughest time is in securing any sort of credit or loans from financial institutions, and the worker-owned factories that have found lasting success have done so by nurturing strong connections with, and support from their local communities.

To answer a few of the `guiding questions', socialism and capitalism are both state-run on behalf of corrupt elites; their just two models for exploiting the people. What the enlightened workers realize is that they cannot depend on any leader of any party, because the entire system, including the so-called democratic process, is entirely corrupt and controlling. No one, for instance, should be at all surprised that Barack Obama is giving the bankers billions and billions of dollars, after the millions they contributed to his election campaign. What we all need is a truly democratic process not for sale to the highest bidder.

When the workers find themselves in control of their own remunerative destinies they learn the greatest lesson of all: (political/economic) freedom = (moral) responsibility and vigilance. Most people are secretly afraid of freedom and the responsibility it demands, and this is why most people have allowed themselves to be enslaved, in one form or another, around the world and throughout human history.

The would-be owners and rulers, like Menem and ""Mr. Zanon"", are forever watching and waiting for their moment. They are leaches with the heart of compulsive gamblers. Their ideal world is a casino and a pair of loaded dice; and any `system' with rules can and will be rigged to benefit them--once they get in. This is why Thomas Jefferson said that every generation needs a revolution to ""renew the blood of freedom"".

Not only is such a anti- or counter-globalist revolution possible in the United States today, it is absolutely necessary if we value our lives and our future. Furthermore, given the current `take' by Wall Street, I believe it is imminent. Our economy is being swallowed whole, and we are headed for an unavoidable cataclysm. But this time, although the revolution will probably not be televised by Murdoch and friends, it will happen on a global scale and succeed in the industrialized cities with universities, where workers can most easily and effectively organize, and where idealistic student activists are a short march away from campus to CBD (Central Business District).

Given current science and technology, a worker-controlled resource based economy will provide an unlimited supply of renewable energy for the cheap production and transportation of food and medicine to every corner of the world. But there's nothing in that for the profiteers -so they'll have to go.

Viva la revolucion!",1238112000,2,4813,5.205426356589148
8097248,5,B000CCD1X4,"A riveting political documentary with beautiful cinematography, high production values, and the power to make me cry.  As a film giving a grand panorama of the dramatic events in Argentina after the cacerola, it does an amazing job. And the big picture view is balanced nicely by the glimpse into the deeply personal. It definitely worked well to follow one single occupation, though I wish we had seen more of the interplay between the men and their discussions upon actually taking over! I suppose it didn't make for riveting. But the footage is incredible, and the individuals inspiring.

This certainly captures the joy and hope and pain of mass struggle, and who can fail to be moved by tiny abuelitas facing down riot cops? It left me wanting to go deeper, to find out more about the occupations themselves, the work of supporting them, the challenges and successes faced by workers, the political context. There was a taste of all these things, but only a taste. I do think that the heroism of the daily struggle to actually make something work for the long-term is often overlooked in favour of photogenic confrontations. As time has shown, there were a lot of undercurrents in the factories that never made it onto film, and to me that is where the true lessons often lie for those wishing to create a better world. Even so, it is a true pleasure to watch, and it's importance in helping create a vision of viable alternatives is profound.

Finally though, the extras are quality! The short on Gustavo Benedetto, one of the victims of police repression, is incredibly touching. It's also a moving look at the people's efforts to remember, and the State's efforts to erase all memory. And the stuff on the making of the film was rather eye-opening!",1228867200,2,1756,4.769736842105263
