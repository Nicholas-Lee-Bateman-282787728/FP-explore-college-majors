8121411,5,B000FEBWU8,"I know two - two year olds who love this. You can interact with your kids and play on the computer at the same time! If your kids want to play on the computer - they can with this! This will keep them focused on one thing for at least an hour - more than you can say for most ""toys"" for two year olds.

All of the boohbah computer games that I've seen so far have been amazing. Teaching kids to wiggle and play - to become involved with art that can be printed out on a computer printer - to make all the noise they want through the games and boohbah adventures!",1173484800,,562,3.9298245614035086
