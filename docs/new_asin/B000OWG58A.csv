Later, I have spent many nights in and around this immediate area as a trucker.  I did not learn or hear anymore about this from locals, but am convinced that something paranormal occurred to these folks.",1431993600,,320,4.406779661016949

8191473,3,B000OWG58A,"This is a documentary about one of the most fascinating close encounter UFO cases. In 1955, the Sutton family's homestead in Kelly, Kentucky was attacked  or approached  by a group of mysterious beings who left the premises only after being literally shot at. An unidentified flying object had been spotted earlier in the afternoon.

The battle at Sutton's farm (or the Kelly-Hopkinsville encounter) soon made national headline news in the United States, and have been mentioned in countless UFO books since. Of course, the sceptics refuse to believe that aliens or goblins were involved, instead blaming everything on the inevitable owls (this time the Great Horned Owl rather than the Barn Owl). Yeah, sure, that's what happened, LOL.

As for this documentary, it's an interesting summary of the case from a believer perspective, but unfortunately the amateur actors who dramatize the events are rather bad and look like stereotyped hillbillies. I almost down-sized my rating to two stars due to this hoot, but eventually I give it three. The program ends with information about new encounters in the area, including lights in triangular formation and a hooded humanoid

Well, at least *that* can't be an owl. Perhaps it's Batman?",1400889600,,1232,5.1708542713567835
