8320266,5,B001M0NITC,This was simply a dvd copy of a program aired on the Discovery channel. The program was excellent and the dvd a complete copy. If the TV program hadn't been so good I wouldn't have bought the dvd - what else can I say here.,1369612800,,223,3.977777777777778
8320267,4,B001M0NITC,"This is certainly an interesting documentary, but it offers nothing more solid than circumstantial evidence, coincidence, and hypothetical scenarios to explain the UFO phenomenon as a continuation of Nazi secret projects being conducted by German scientists brought to the US under the aegis of Project Paperclip.  Certainly, there is growing evidence that German scientists were breaking new ground in developing radically new forms of propulsion and delivery systems, and we know that the US seized a number of prototypes and research notes along with the scientists themselves.  (Among these were the Horton brothers' Flying Wing; a saucer-shaped craft supposedly capable of ascending vertically using unconventional means; and a mysterious device dubbed The Bell, which some have claimed to be a zero-gravity flying machine).  However, we really do not know how much of German technology fell into the hands of the American government following the war, and there is no solid evidence to substantiate the claims of Nazi scientific breakthroughs.

Why should we consider the idea that the UFOs of the post-war era were actually top-secret test flights of German-engineered flying craft?  The documentary provides us with several reasons, none of which rise above the level of conjecture.  For one thing, the first wave of UFO sightings in America began in mid-1947, which could coincide with Project Paperclip scientists settling in to their new scientific roles in the US and getting heavily involved in their secret project work once again.  Additionally, many UFO sightings took place near military bases, which would make sense if the UFOs were actually secret aircraft being taken through their aerial paces.  Then there was the ill-fated Avrocar of the 1950s, which could have been inspired by the work German scientists had reportedly been doing on self-propelled circular flying craft.  The German Flying Wing, it is suggested, could have formed the foundation of the stealth technology that led to the creation of the B-2 bomber and other stealth aircraft still in use today.  As for the Nazi Bell, the documentary offers up the possibility that the object that crashed in Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, in 1965 bore a number of similarities to the mysterious Bell that German scientists built and began testing in 1945.  It's all pure speculation, really.

None of the ideas offered up in this documentary can be proven, of course, and those ideas certainly can't explain the origin of UFO sightings all over the world.  It is suggested that post-war UFO sightings over South America might be explained as the continuing work of German scientists who successfully escaped the Third Reich before its total defeat, but there were no former German scientists holed up in secret labs across Europe or Asia.  Any theories on the true nature of the Nazi Bell are also problematic because they come largely from one man, Polish researcher Igor Witkowski, who claims to have read secret documents no one else has ever seen.  You also have to ask why the Avrocar was such a failure if it was based on a German craft that had reportedly been much more successful.  The fact of the matter is that this documentary is based purely on conjecture - quite interesting conjecture - but pure conjecture nonetheless.",1291507200,,3305,5.184210526315789
