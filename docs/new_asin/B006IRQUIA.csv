4991100,5,B006IRQUIA,"Although, Brynn Thayer was my personal least favorite of the Matlock partners, she does deliver a great performance as LeeAnne McIntyre.  The seventh season also the first appearance of Cliff Lewis portrayed by actor Daniel Roebuck, which had appeared in previous episodes as other characters as did Thayer.  This like other previous Matlock packages has superior acting & direction of episodes and yes just like Thayer & Roebuck both who appeared as other characters in previous seasons, you will also see others such as Randy Travis.  Just as with TAGS, Matlock does have a musical flare whenever possible.  You cannot go wrong with this set or any of the Matlock sets for that matter.  Of course, I cannot leave out the most important acting of Andy Griffith as Ben Matlock, a super sleuth, brilliant lawyer and hot dog lover.",1330819200,16,829,4.9352517985611515
4991101,5,B006IRQUIA,"After hearing the rumours that season 7 would possibly not be released, I was thrilled to see that they did.  Many times I started a collection of my favourite shows(NYPD BLUE and MAMA'S FAMILY I'am looking at you!) only to have subsequent seasons just stop coming out.  I love Matlock and although I definitely did not enjoy the show as much with Jerri Stone, I will definitely be buying this season and season 8 for sure. And since I hate it that Amazon does not list the episodes, I will do so here.  From what I could find online and from what I remember, here are season 7's episodes

4991165,4,B006IRQUIA,"I bought this to add to my Matlock collection.  Growing up, my kids knew better than to interrupt mom during Matlock, and this was largely a nostalgia purchase.  The later seasons are still good, but it's obvious that the series was winding down.  Still, it's a lot of fun.",1402099200,2,273,4.530612244897959
4991166,5,B006IRQUIA,"The most memorable show is ""The Ghost.""  In this whimsical episode, a man has been receiving anonymous letters accusing his wife of infidelity, they argue about it, she shoves him, he falls, she leaves, and before he can get up someone murders him.  She's accused of his murder and believes she was responsible for his death.  His ghost wants Ben to defend her!  Many funny moments.

This season's supporting characters:
Leanne McIntyre (10 shows), Ben's daughter/associate.  In ""The Debt"", she defends her ex and in the process, learns her Dad was right - he's a bum!
Conrad McMasters (4), Ben's investigator.  In ""The Final Affair"", he gets to sing in the church choir.
Cliff Lewis (4).  In ""The Vacation"", he tried to trick Ben into hiring him, but ended up needing Ben to defend him.
Billy Lewis (2), Cliff's father.  In ""The Fortune"", he can't convince Ben to invest in a new doll;  it does well ... until he's sued.
Russ Lewis (1), Billy's brother.  In ""The Competition"", he is Ben's worst nightmare for a houseguest.
Charlie Matlock (1), Ben's father (played by Andy Griffith).  In ""The Legacy"", he was accused of committing a murder years ago!

Alas, these characters ""did not return"" in season seven:  detective Lt. Bob Brooks,  associate Michelle Thomas,  prosecutor Julie March, neighbor Les Calhoun (Don Knotts), and housekeeper Miss McCardle.

Comment:  There is an apparent gradual shift from stories in and around Atlanta to the Atlantic coast.
Extras:  Episode teasers.  To see these, you must select individual episodes, not the ""Play All"" option.
DVD - 2012.  Color, Contrast, and Resolution:  good to excellent.  Sound:  volume normal; clarity excellent.",1399593600,3,1673,5.043956043956044
4991167,5,B006IRQUIA,I really like the series and have been buying them on sale from Amazon but still need seasons 8 and 9.,1397433600,,102,3.9047619047619047
4991168,5,B006IRQUIA,Can't wait to start watching the next season.  Took on a plane trip and was entertained for the duration of the flight,1396828800,,118,4.363636363636363
4991169,5,B006IRQUIA,"These shows have so much to offer in character and plot, you can watch them many times and always enjoy.",1395792000,,104,4.25
4991170,3,B006IRQUIA,this is the only season that was some what so so to us... I think its do to most of the shows only had matlock and his daughter in them The shows are better with all the other people in them as well. I read about 8th season sounds like there back so I will get the last two seasons for my husband .. if any thing its been nice spinding time with him he like perry masson as well....  they have been good to.. me I love all the BBC  any way have fun with this show ...,1391731200,,467,3.707070707070707
4991171,5,B006IRQUIA,I have watched all the Matlock shows over repeatedly.  Now I have my own copy I can do so any time I want.,1389744000,3,106,3.608695652173913
4991182,5,B006IRQUIA,"Always enjoy watching Matlock! My wife and I love Andy Griffith; although Conrad goes off after this season, we still enjoyed the homespun humor and the somewhat clean content on the show.",1389571200,,188,4.90625
4991183,5,B006IRQUIA,One of my favorite episodes of Matlock was The Ghost episode. I just didn't know in what season they made it. So it was a very good surprise to me when I found it in this season. Each season of Matlock is great but each one has those very special episodes that made it all great. And season 7 is no different. On to season 8 now.,1388880000,,329,3.925373134328358
4991184,5,B006IRQUIA,I always enjoyed watching Andy Griffith  in all his movies and tv serials.  It is a wholesome family show for the whole family.,1387584000,,127,4.478260869565218
4991185,5,B006IRQUIA,"I have no idea how many times I have seen each episode.  This is one of the top TV series from that decade.  Definitely in my top 15.  Clever, yet Matlock's character flaws are very funny.  (especially his being such a cheapskate and insisting on wearing the same suit everyday...although he did have an identical one he could change into when that one got dirty)  Humorous courtroom antics.",1386979200,,391,4.6911764705882355
4991186,5,B006IRQUIA,I chose this rating because Matlock is my favorite lawyer (2nd is Perry Mason).  I love hotdogs just lik Ben!,1386374400,,109,4.45
4991187,5,B006IRQUIA,I love the Matlock series and the interesting way they evolve the characters as well as the Great Plot lines and the humor added here and there...  Good news is that there are 9 seasons of shows - bad news is that there are only 9 seasons of this series.  A real Thumbs up to Andy Griffith for a 2nd wonderful TV show.,1381881600,2,318,4.031746031746032

4991189,5,B006IRQUIA,"I've enjoyed Matlock for years, now I'm finally buying it.  The DVD and quality is excellent.  I can use closed captions.  The people I bought it from were prompt in their delivery, and it was well packaged.  No dispute on billing.  Everything was great.",1371686400,,254,4.681818181818182
4991190,5,B006IRQUIA,"With very few modern shows that are worth watching, I still love to watch the old shows over and over.  The DVD arrived in great condition because of its packing and the shows are very high quality.  I have the entire collection so far.",1370995200,,236,4.340909090909091
4991191,5,B006IRQUIA,My wife has said this is one of the best Christmas present I could have gotten her.  The shows are good quality and the set up is easy for her to use and choose which show she wants.,1370131200,,182,3.789473684210526
4991205,5,B006IRQUIA,"With so much garbage (in our opinion) making it's way to prime time TV, We have been building a library of GOOD morally decent shows with interesting plots without following a social agenda of shock or violence or sexual trendiness. Matlock, Columbo, Perry Mason and other such TV series will all find their way into our library.",1366156800,,329,4.7894736842105265
4991206,5,B006IRQUIA,I love Matlock and LeeAnne and dad have a wonderful chemistry which makes their case solving intriguing and wanting to see the resolution.,1365292800,,138,5.043478260869565
4991207,5,B006IRQUIA,Andy Griffith is the best. He plays a great part no matter what kinda part it is. I liked him playing Andy in that Andy Griffith show. Great job Andy You will be missed!,1364688000,,169,4.0
4991208,5,B006IRQUIA,I could see these show over and over again.  I love Matlock.  I wanted these in my library just in case america didn't agree with me.  Everything was great.,1361404800,,156,4.310344827586207

4991210,5,B006IRQUIA,"This season is more detective than lawyer, Good cast, interesting plots, and is it has Andy!  What more could be said.  It's fun.",1357948800,,129,4.565217391304348
4991211,4,B006IRQUIA,"almost know the shows by heart but still enjoy. Watch and wish any of this could ever happen in a ""real"" courtroom.",1357516800,,115,4.2727272727272725

4991214,5,B006IRQUIA,I would tell everybody about it and can hardly wait for season 8 to come out Feb/2013 Matlock the whole series would be a better purchase. but I did not know I would like it so much.,1354665600,,182,3.945945945945946
4991215,5,B006IRQUIA,Matlock was one of the best series ever on TV. And the two years that Brynn Thayer did the program were the best of its nine seasons. Many of the shows were more sophisticated than those with other co-stars. Although Andy Griffith played a lawyer the show was essentially a detective show as Ben Matlock figued out who the real killer was. Griffith considered this his best series and so do I.,1352505600,,393,4.472222222222222

4991217,4,B006IRQUIA,"I grew up with Matlock and love the show, but by the end of season 7 it seemed to weaken(Just my opinion). I still enjoyed season seven and may Andy Griffith RIP.",1349568000,,162,4.09375
4991218,5,B006IRQUIA,"Loved this show have seen all of Matlock and hope that they put season 8 out soon. I have seen these when they first aired, and I have all one thu seven so far, and hope to see season 8. Thanks for making this into dvd.",1348099200,,219,3.782608695652174

4991221,5,B006IRQUIA,I really love all of the Matlock Series.  Can't wait for Season 8 and 9 to come out. Sorry to hear of Andy Griffith's passing.  We can still enjoy his shows on DVD .  He can still make us laugh and enjoy his wonderful acting.,1341964800,6,225,3.9555555555555557
4991222,4,B006IRQUIA,"The seventh season has only 5 DVDs and the first episodes are nice, but a bit strange. Maybe they wanted to give the series a slightly turn with Matlock's ""new"" daughter. With the second DVD, Matlock is Matlock as we know him and we enjoyed watching him.

I'm in the UK and I had to pay a separate charge of 17, when it was delivered. All in all, the seventh series cost me 50.",1333584000,,377,4.094594594594595
