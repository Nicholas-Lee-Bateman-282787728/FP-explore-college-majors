8034085,1,B0002XEEF2,"I recently purchased this item, FIRST, I was sent the wrong item (a totally different movie)... I had to go through the hassle of re-packing it. the movie was then replaced. When I got the other movie, it NEVER WORKED IN MY VCR. I kept getting the error message: CANNOT read this type of disc.  I got so mad I threw it away and never bothered to send it back. TOO INCONVENIENT...

I'M VERY DISSATISFIED....",1318896000,,406,4.4
8034086,5,B0002XEEF2,This is a very erotic movie and I have watched it several times. It is my intent to pass it on to a friend!,1276560000,,107,3.5
8034087,3,B0002XEEF2,"the best part was the end. why? because then I no longer had to ask the question ""will it ever get any better?"" I watched it in Spanish, without the subtitles - you really didn't need them. there was dialogue maybe 25% of the time, or less. lots of slow moving scenes, ""telling"" looks, and sheer boringness. and lots of bummed out, baffled, depressed people. Yes, some very HOT sex scenes, and admittedly, the female lead does an amazing job - very convincing - great expression, very strong psychologically. but the character is just so weird - totally horny beyond belief: getting herself off with an unconscious guy's hand, fondling her breasts while she is getting it in reverse cowgirl, opening up her dress to tempt a priest, etc etc - this is one horny chick! I don't know  - you gotta be in the mood for this. And they put the makeup on for her fake ""birthmark"" slightly differently in every scene....hey, instead of shooting herself at the end, she should have become mayor or governor of Mexico.  - she was a pretty strong chick (although exceptionally horny, of course) well, it's definitely an experience, but one I'd rather not have had.",1270080000,,1150,4.6600985221674875
8034088,4,B0002XEEF2,"I am not a big fan of director Dana Rotberg's earlier work, or for that matter the whole haute arte school of Mexican filmmaking to which she belongs (of which Arturo Ripstein is the principal influence and auteur).  Nevertheless, I found La Mujer del Pueblo to be a complete delight.  Set somewhere vaguely between the Victorian era and the roaring 20s (el Porfiriato a la Revolucion in Mexican parlance), the period details are absolutely first-rate, from a freshly painted pulqueria to the dirt-covered streets to the furniture and wardrobes.  It just feels like you were transformed to the turn of the century.  The use of color and evocative settings is truly a pleasure to experience: several scenes feel like period paintings set to gentle motion.  But rather than directing this into a plotless and  offensive void like most of the films of her movement, Rotberg provides just enough of a plot, frequently peppered by incidences of most subtle yet profound ironies of Mexican life, all the while letting Gabriela Canudas steal every scene with her delightful screen aura.  It is a shame but unfortunately not a surprise neither she nor her director have done anything of consequence since.

The DVD has optional English subtitles only and the original Spanish audio.",1252713600,3,1274,5.033333333333333
8034089,4,B0002XEEF2,"I really enjoyed this film, the story was both sad and scandalous. If you like betrayal, Romance and sex this film will not disappoint. It is a moderate paced but inviting story about a beautiful woman, blessed with a perfect body by both male and female standards, with a remarkable birth defect, a large dark birthmark on the left side of her face.  That in itself presents unimaginable challenges to Otilia's dramatic and turbulent life.  It's a gripping yet sad tale of infidelity, lawbreaking and jealousy but not completely a ""Chick Flick"".  People get shot, a priest gets a ""peek"" and  My favorite scene involves a major character grandstanding at a public gathering, completely in the nude, with a basket on their head.  Priceless scene.  The acting is good and the setting is eye catching. there is one character, a handicapped male lead who served almost no purpose...but i got passed that.  The quality of this film could be better however, it takes nothing from the well written story.  its like reading a good book.",1233792000,6,1028,4.8342857142857145
8034090,5,B0002XEEF2,"I thought this movie was going to be very boring, but to my surprise it's a very enjoyable film.  It starts of slow, but builds up to a very sad conclusion.  I do believe that people who like semi-romatic drama will enjoy this film for the vaule that it holds.  It does some nudity that might offend some people, but over all it's ok.",1229990400,5,334,4.1875
