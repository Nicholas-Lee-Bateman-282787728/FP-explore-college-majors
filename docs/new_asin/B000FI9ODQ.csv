2566216,5,B000FI9ODQ,"Capitalizing on the success of ""House,"" the BBC have finally decided to release ""A Bit of Fry & Laurie"" on DVD, and I couldn't be happier.  I got hooked on Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry while watching the Blackadder series, and have followed them through to other projects (Laurie's ""House"" and his book, ""The Gun Seller"" and Fry's fantastic program in the UK ""QI"") with great satisfaction.  However, being from the States, and living there during the run of ""A Bit of..."" I hadn't been able to see much of the series til now.

The DVD doesn't disappoint.  The duo's comic prowess comes through clear as a bell from the start of the disc.  Ironic, urbane, witty, and cheeky--it's British sketch comedy at its best.  There's a lot of great word play, and great comic timing throughout.  I'd highly recommend it to any fan of BritCom.",1150416000,45,830,4.6438356164383565

2566248,5,B000FI9ODQ,"Simply put, Gregory House, M.D. and the Master of Laketown from the Hobbit movies were perhaps the funniest comedy twosome ever to hit the small screen.

Whaaa--?

Okay, not those characters, specifically, but the people who played them: Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie. Following a 23-episode run reinterpreting the famed P.G. Wodehouse novels (with Fry playing the long-suffering butler Jeeves and Laurie the addle-pated gentleman Bertie Wooster, respectively), the duo took their inimitable chemistry to an entirely new level in the BBC series A Bit of Fry & Laurie.

2566276,5,B000FI9ODQ,"When first watching these wonderful comedians, you may find their sketches lacking in substance and bite and often just merely silly. But take into account how far back these sketches started, these two started working together, and watch how they evoked from first to last of all the episodes, and you will find that revolution revealing and their comic pace and daring risk admirable.",1402531200,,386,5.046875
2566277,2,B000FI9ODQ,Was interested in this only because of Hugh Laurie.  Could not get through the first episode.  Comedy is dated and we just did not care enough to stick with it.

2566285,5,B000FI9ODQ,Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie are each comedic wonders in their own right.  Together they are amazing.  Post-Monty Python in sophistication but very much like them (not surprising since many went to university together).  This is well worth the time. You will not regret it.,1400284800,,272,5.0

2566289,4,B000FI9ODQ,"Good comedy sketches - some satirical (well, many satirical), some ridiculous, and everywhere in between. Occasionally, the satire does require passing familiarity with Great Britain of the 1970s - 1980s - but the themes tend to be universal enough that they can be appreciated regardless.  Most of the fare is family friendly - but some of the sketches can include adult language / themes that would not be suitable for younger viewers.",1397779200,,437,5.069444444444445

2566304,4,B000FI9ODQ,Interesting to see these two men early in their careers.  Full of the typical British dry humor and satirical skits.  Loved the kid in the first skit who fought to keep a straight face.,1396656000,,185,4.411764705882353

I expected more in wit, which this lacks, and relies on the common need for sexual references.",1396224000,,131,5.0
2566306,5,B000FI9ODQ,"The short sketches may remind you of Montry Python, but I think they are a bit more cerebral and less slapstick. I don't think most Americans really know Fry or Hugh Laurie, but you've probably watched them in the 'Black Adder' series or 'Jeeves and Wooster'. And Laurie later starred in 'House'.",1395532800,,296,4.711538461538462
2566307,2,B000FI9ODQ,"Having just watched QI, the ""quiz"" show that Stephen Fry did for British TV on which Hugh Laurie was a guest, I was expecting something better.  There are some funny bits, but others are just a bit dumb.  There is no real connection between the different setups so it seems disjointed.  I suppose like wine they got better with age.
I found the QI program on Acorn TV, I wish it was available on Amazon.  If you get a chance to see it - do so.  Each half hour is very funny and to some extent informative.  There is a book of some of the information available on Amazon, but like any good comedy it is better to hear it rather than just read it.",1395446400,,645,4.12

2566309,5,B000FI9ODQ,Fry and Laurie are my favorite comedy team of all time with 'Jeeves and Wooster' being the best of what they did. This show is a variety of odd and quirky skits that seem to come together with a perfect mesh. Some of the routines come straight from there years with 'Alfresco' but they have polished them to perfection in 'A Bit of Fry and Laurie'.,1394928000,,348,4.287878787878788
2566310,1,B000FI9ODQ,"These two really let the side down with this offering.  There had to be a ""laugh track"" to makeup the audience response, because the comedy was no comedy at all.  If you are familiar with ""Jeeves and Wooster"" you will find these earlier offerings to be really sub-standard for Laurie and Fry.  Sorry, but can't recommend this program.",1394755200,,334,4.724137931034483

2566406,3,B000FI9ODQ,"Fifteen years before ""House,"" Hugh Laurie and his best pal Stephen Fry began writing and performing ""A Little Bit of Fry and Laurie,"" a series of half-hour sketch programs.

This is wonderfully silly stuff, thanks to the duo's enthusiasm for wacky costumes, wigs and body language.

This is wonderfully clever stuff, thanks to the love Laurie and (especially) Fry have for language.

In between the sketches are delightfully strange ""Man-(or Man-Dressed-As-Woman)on-the-Street"" clips.

Not every skit is a winner. But most are pretty short so it's not long before something better comes in.

It's clear how big an influence Monty Python was on these two. Fry and Laurie are somewhat kinder and gentler, perhaps because there are only two of them (versus six Pythons); they can't get quite as loud.

My favorite sketch involves a policeman (Fry), taking a crime report from a strangely-named citizen (Laurie). I'm also very fond of Tony (Laurie) and Control (Fry), members of the British Secret Service. The situations and dialogue are mildly funny. But, pay attention to the way these fellows portray their characters - intentionally stilted and offbeat. It's brilliant.

If you know Hugh Laurie only from ""House,"" be prepared to admire him even more.",1293753600,,1251,5.1940298507462686
2566407,2,B000FI9ODQ,"As is often the case with classic comedy duos, there are brilliant parts and drab, embarrassing parts. Similarly, there is the magnificent partner in the duo, and the adequate one. Such all is found here.

Hugh Laurie here is brilliant. He demonstrates a full range of comedic prowess, as well as true musical ability. The humor Stephen Fry would later be known for, as seen in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jeeves-Wooster/dp/B00006AVRK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jeeves & Wooster</a>&nbsp;has yet to mature, and too frequently relies on fumbling innuendo and outright bawdiness.

An extremely funny 'skitlet' is a verbal mix-up. Fry is a customer complaining of his soup, and Laurie is the waiter constantly confused thinking he is talking about his suit. On one hand, it is predictable. You know Laurie will not get it, and Fry will continue to insist his soup is wrong. However, it is how they get there that is hilarious. Finally, with no true end to the joke in sight, they stop, and ask for a caller to suggest closure. A caller (unheard, just named 'JD') naturally helps out with a dry, not particularly original finish, and Fry smiles and says to the audience, ""Nice one, JD."" Excellent timing by Fry.

More like that, and the DVD would be a fantastic example of British humor. Instead, though, we see too much of Fry's sexual self-indulgence, with jokes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Benny-Hill/dp/B000T28PGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Benny Hill</a>&nbsp;would have rejected.

A Bit of Fry and Laurie - Season One was not for me. More seasons followed, so they have their audience members. I am not among them.

2566408,3,B000FI9ODQ,"""...you cast me as the mouse in your little cat drama""

This series is slightly reminiscent of Monty Python, only not as (I hate to put is so bluntly) good.  The problem mostly lies in the fact that many of these skits are parodies and reference pop culture and events - more like Saturday Night Live.  So when watching something from that long ago - and from that far away - it wasn't nearly as enjoyable as if I'd been able to get all of the nuances.  That's not to say that none of it was enjoyable (there certainly were moments that made me laugh) but it could have been better.

I know, nothing tops the great Monty Python, so I should be disappointed.  But, given how much I've enjoyed Stephen Fry on Whose Line is it Anyway? and Hugh Laurie as House, well, I was a bit let down.  I'd say summing up this as a cross between Monty Python and Saturday Night Live, 20 years out of date, is the best description.

2566419,4,B000FI9ODQ,"Before they were the crusty misanthropic doctor in the TV series House and the king of plummy voice-overs, Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry were overeducated sketch comedians. Their BBC shows were quirky, hit-and-miss affairs in the post-Monty Python vein, and are a worthy slice of British TV history from the late 1980s. These shows were designed as half-hour throwaway entertainment, and so they're not something you'll study over and over again, but they're entertaining nonetheless.",1168905600,7,482,5.44

2566421,5,B000FI9ODQ,"Four seasons were not enough of this wonderful, hilarious show written and performed solely by Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie (okay, in the fourth series they had some famous guests like Imelda Staunton and Phyllida Law and a few extras here and there throughout the run of the show, but mostly, it was just the two of them.)

Their writing is amazing and their performances are doubly so.  I highly recommend buying these discs.  Fantastic.",1151539200,34,438,4.8133333333333335
2566422,5,B000FI9ODQ,"'A Bit of Fry and Laurie' ranks as one of the greatest sketch shows ever to hit British television. However its fame is nowhere near as widespread as that of its counterparts 'Fawlty Towers' and 'Monty Python's Flying Circus'. Because of this lower profile it is rarely re-run on television and DVD and VHS releases are very limited. This is why it was with great joy that I heard of the DVD release of their complete first two series.

Having seen what Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie have to offer, it is difficult to understand why they have not had more widespread success. Their humour is fantastically witty and posesses the sophistication and finesse that other programmes so sorely lack. Stephen Fry's manipulation of the English language is always amusing and his talents fused with those of Hugh Laurie are a potent mix. Indeed it may sometimes remind the viewer of their other collaboration on 'Jeeves and Wooster'.

It is great news that this series has finally been committed to DVD and not simply a 'best of'. I would urge all comedy fans to buy this DVD and enjoy what is a top class comedy programme.",1151107200,43,1112,4.668367346938775

May be the best comedy duo I have ever seen. The fact that they are both brilliant serious actors (Fry in the film based on Oscar Wilde's life is amazing. Laurie of course is known for House) shows just how talented they are. Highly recommended. Funniest show I have seen in awhile. I know it is an older show, but it's not dated at all!",1510704000,,496,4.123711340206185
