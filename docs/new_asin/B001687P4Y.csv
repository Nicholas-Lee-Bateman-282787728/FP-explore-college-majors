8584208,5,B001687P4Y,"It is a very well done documentary on the Wakulla Springs. The clips
show early footage of the Florida Parks, and are fun to watch. Any
history buff will enjoy seeing the archival footage that has been saved
from destruction. There are also bonus tracks showing the other areas
that Edward Ball set up in the hopes of keeping some of Florida in a
natural state to share with future generations. Any one familiar with
Tallahassee, will enjoy the segment on the Southwood Farms, which is
now a subdivision, but was once a nature preserve. The footage that was used to make up the documentary came from old advertising footage for the springs, as well as movies shot by the department of defense when it was used as a training ground for the invasion of Normandy. The footage was gone through trying to save as much of the old film as possible from a vault on the Wakulla Springs property.",1208304000,,886,4.54375
