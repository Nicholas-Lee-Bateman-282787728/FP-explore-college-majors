8756711,5,B01DRW920G,"Excellent series. Season 3 of Nazi Mega Weapons doesn't disappoint. Disc 1 has four episodes focusing on the German Blitzkrieg, state of the art submarines, Hitler's Eagles Nest and Megafortress. But the series doesn't just focus on the Germans, this time Disc 2 of the series explores the Tunnels Of Okinawa and how the Japanese had miles of underground tunnels on the island making it difficult for the U.S. troops when they invaded. Another episode is of the Japanese battleship the Yumato, which was the biggest battleship ever built. Great series that never disappoints.",1514160000,,575,5.127659574468085
8756712,3,B01DRW920G,"This would have been a much better series if it was straight documentary instead of ""docu-drama.""  The actors playing Hitler relied entirely on a brush mustache and lots of shouting for their portrayal of the Nazi leader, truly comic performances.  Historical footage was superimposed in brief flashes on flat surfaces in the picture - very annoying.  That said, I DID learn some stuff I didn't know before.  You may enjoy these as long as you don't expect too much.",1495843200,2,466,4.860759493670886
