I have seen excerpts from this particular DVD on U tube, however, and the quality seemed much better on there. I wonder why this is, are there other versions available?
However, that said we must treasure any recordings which exist from this wonderful performer.",1459987200,,435,5.185714285714286

8576895,3,B00C2YBK7Y,"I saw Corelli many times, including at his very best in a Boheme a few months before this concert. I assure you that he was, unfortunately, not in prime form at this Tokyo concert. I have no idea why all these reviewers claim that he was. By 1971, Franco had his ups and downs, thought his real vocal problems didn't begin until the next year. He remained capable of pulling a rabbit out of the hat to the very end of his opera career, but I never heard truly prime form from this magnificent tenor after that April, 1971 Boheme. It is a disservice to Corelli to listen to him here, at age 50, and think this was the best he could do. Not by a long shot.
