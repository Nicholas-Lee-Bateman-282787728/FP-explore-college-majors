I didn't know what to expect...This is it.  This is the band that fills the shoes of the late, great Dio-area Rainbow.  Axel Rudi Pell is as exciting as Ritchie Blackmore was back in the day.  This guy is simply jaw-dropping good...great.  What a guitarists.  The songs are all very good, the sound is very good, the video quality is pretty darn good - lot's of great ""performance shots.""

I am disappointed that this great band doesn't appear to be touring the states.  If I had the cash, I'd fly to Europe just to catch one of their shows.  This is one of the best Rock Concert DVDs that I have ever purchased (I own more than 1,000 concert DVDs).  I certainly wouldn't classify this music as ""Metal.""  I'm not a metal fan and I love this group's music.  Folks, this is excellent ""Hard Rock,"" as performed by the likes of Rainbow, Deep Purple, Uriah Heep, Black Sabbath...even Zeppelin.  The only thing is, Axel Rudi Pell is a much faster - even more technical - guitarist than Blackmore, Box, Iommi or Page, so sometimes the solos take on a similar ""style"" as some of the metal guitarists.  Still, this can't be Metal, because if it was, I wouldn't like it so much!  This is hard rock...some of the best hard rock I've heard in years.  What a great @#$%!&! band...!",1348358400,,1413,4.565737051792829

I hope to see ARP live some time.",1106870400,,218,5.055555555555555

AWESOME !!! Thats it. Just Awesome.
Pick this up if you are into ARP or that kind of heavy metal music or if you just want to watch some great musicians play at their best !!!",1103673600,,384,3.753086419753086
7973838,5,B000070WFQ,"When I first bought this DVD, I wasn't too sure what to expect. Ive been listening to ARP stuff for about 2 years now and knew a lot of the songs, but from the DVD I only knew about 3 or 4, which isn't too bad considering theres only 10. I put it in and soon after I was just totally amazed. It was hard, it was loud and it was 100% ARP. Throughout the concert you can really see just how musically talented everyone in the band is. With Axels guitar, Fredy's keyboards, and even Mike on the drums....(he just totally goes ape on that kit). Johnny's vocals I think are the best in music right now, he just has such a talented voice and you can see he really feels the lyrics that hes singing. The best song of the concert has to be the masquerade ball/casbah/drum solo/stargazer meledy. It really showcases everything that is ARP, not to mention its over 25 minutes long! With the 2 chicks doing backup singing, and just an overall great concert this is a must have to everyone who enjoys not only ARP but also melodic metal or any metal at that. There are a few surprises durring the songs too, once you see this DVD, you will have played the air guitar, had more than a few good laughs, but most of all, want to watch it again.",1071014400,2,1229,4.189873417721519
