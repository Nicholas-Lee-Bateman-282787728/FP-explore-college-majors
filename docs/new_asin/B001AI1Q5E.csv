8277527,2,B001AI1Q5E,"This DVD is loaded with invaluable tips, including how to travel around the city, saving money at the major museums, and what to look for in a hotel. The information this DVD provides is very useful and is a nice complement to Rick Steves. Now the caveat: the kids are so freaking annoying. EVERYWHERE they went, they acted up. At the British Museum, they were touching Egyptian artifacts. I was a kid once. My brother and I joked around, but we were NEVER that out of control. If we acted like that in public, our parents would take out their belt...

London is an awesome city and I encourage people to visit it. This DVD showcases many of the wonderful attractions in the city. Unfortunately, the Roberts kids marred what was otherwise a great DVD.",1440979200,,751,4.562962962962963
8277528,5,B001AI1Q5E,"Make some popcorn and toss the pillows on the floor!  Join the Roberts Family, including Nathan, 7, and Seamus, 5, on holiday to the beautiful city of London, England.  Our trip begins with a train ride from the airport into the city, followed by a boat tour on the Thames River, the Tower of London and the Tower Bridge. The light tone of the trip is quickly set with a glossary of British equivalents, i.e. French fries called chips, and chips called crisps.  Hmm, not quite our English, is it?

The self-guided tour on the battleship HMS Belfast delights with plenty of hands-on opportunities, followed by Buckingham Palace and the Changing of the Guard, then back to the hotel for afternoon tea.  Other attractions include the British Museum, Piccadilly Circus at night, a ride on the famous red double-decker bus and Trafalgar Square.  Further exploration takes us to see Big Ben, Hyde Park, and The London Eye, one of the world's largest Ferris wheels where the seats are enclosed in a sort of glass bubble. The slow revolution of the Eye allows for terrific aerial views of the city.

Narration is provided throughout by a British speaker who relates the history on a variety of subjects, but with amusing graphics and special effects the factual lessons are painless.  Mom Carrie and the boys often comment as well.  In addition, pop-ups with the boys holding signs provide information on prices, food, and times of interesting events, making this DVD valuable for those planning a trip themselves.

Though this family has the means to travel with two children, they are by no means elite snobs.  They clearly have a budget, passing up a coveted tour of Westminster Abbey due to the cost.  Instead, the parents romp in a nearby park with the two boys, both of whom are normal, fairly high-spirited guys.  Certainly any bad moments have been edited, but spending fifty minutes watching their activities and listening to their commentary was very enjoyable. - just the right mix of sights, history and levity to keep the interest of any age level!",1227225600,,2053,4.831428571428572
