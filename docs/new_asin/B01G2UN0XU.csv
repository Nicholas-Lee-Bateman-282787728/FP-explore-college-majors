8762188,4,B01G2UN0XU,"I'm happy to see this DVD available in the United States. Others may note that this film is not up to the standards of Carn's earlier work, and they would be correct.  However, L'Air de Paris still a film worth seeing. The same cannot be said for the English subtitles.  Quite apart from spelling errors and typos, the translation is often inept enough to be flat out wrong and sometimes unintelligible.  So if you don't understand French, you will be missing something.",1472169600,,470,4.7073170731707314
