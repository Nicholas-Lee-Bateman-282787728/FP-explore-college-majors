The video could have been edited a lot tighter and much shorter.  The background production music is repetitive, and actually sickening, being repeated all the way through.  The recipes are listed very quickly on the screen, and there is no on screen anything.  Overall good information...  Really lacking on production and editing and technical.  You would have to watch a lot of youtube videos to get all of this information.",1419638400,,594,5.051546391752577

8299962,5,B001EYG168,"We bought this set of 4 Chinese Take-Out Cooking DVDs about a year ago as a gift for my daughter. This turned out to be gift to ourselves as she has taken to cooking some of the dishes for us once a month or so. While each DVD covers a specific area, they all some things in common:

* The ingredient list is very quickly shown at start of section, so it is best to pause and write them down because they are not always identified as the dish is being prepared.

* They also point you to their web site for spice and ingredient info. I should note that there is a lot of good information and tips on the site.

* They reference other videos in the series for more detailed instructions

* The video was shot without benefit of a tripod, so it can be a little jumpy and a little distracting

* The background music is somewhat repetitive and also a little distracting
