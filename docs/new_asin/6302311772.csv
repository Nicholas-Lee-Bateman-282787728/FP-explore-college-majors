7824245,4,6302311772,"The VHS is a little ""jumpy"" so you have to constantly adjust the tracking.  The Thighmaster was the program I used to
drop a lot of weight and tone up back in the early 90's.  One of the most successful of many that I tried.  This video
helps you get through the exercises and it makes you sweat through them too if you are out of shape.

I'd recommend this to anyone who is interested in toning, shaping & losing weight with one program.",1360886400,,438,4.178571428571429
