5625206,1,B00BIYQPBA,"Utter crap!  I love Tatiana Maslany, but this movie is cliched, exploitative, and trite.  You'd think a film written by a women would
not succumb to easy and harmful stereotypes of girls and young women, but you'd be wrong. For example, the freshmen boy
who is smart and supposedly sensitive left his school for gifted kids to go to the public high school because there
are no girls at his school!  This movie was made in 2012, and only boys can be smart?  Tatiana's character is
also the cliche of the girl with the pathetic mom who only values herself in relation to men and so her daughter
must follow suit--her only way of ""communicating"" with men is sexually.  She has no self-esteem or skills whatsoever and needs to be saved by
the freshmen nerdy boy, who has a creepy collection of her things in sealed plastic envelopes, including her used gum and underwear.
He's more like a serial killer in the making, and yet, he's supposed to be her true friend. At the end, even he, her ""friend,"" just wants
to have sex with her. After which, he insults her abilities in bed!  I'm completely baffled as to how anyone can like this movie or find merit in it.",1424995200,,1155,4.476190476190476
5625207,4,B00BIYQPBA,"Tatiana Maslany is one of the best actresses today, everyone who has seen her in Orphan Black can support this statement.  In this movie, she plays a convincing 18-year-old better than most of the 19/20-year-old actors play them on TV and movies, at 27.  From her voice, attitude, and physicality, she inhabits this character.  Overall, the movie has a good story line, with good acting all around, you feel and relate to all of the characters. Rent and enjoy this little Canadian film!",1419897600,3,486,4.831325301204819
5625208,5,B00BIYQPBA,Tatiana is wonderful in this movie as Claire Paxton. A very insecure lonely girl who uses sex as her only way to connect with guys. Claire is a very sweet girl albeit misguided with a twisted sense of humor.,1401840000,,207,4.333333333333333
5625209,4,B00BIYQPBA,"We wanted to see this movie because we like Tatiana Maslany in Orphan Black.  We were not disappointed.  This is a nicely-done coming-of-age story.  Both the young actors are quite charming.  I was worried that Maslany, who was in her late 20s when she made this, wouldn't be able to be convincing as a 19-year-old, but she was fine. Her body language particularly was very expressive of the energy and freshness of a teen.",1382918400,4,423,4.675675675675675
5625210,5,B00BIYQPBA,"This film definitely spoke to me! Good times and not so good times in high school. Came across this little delight through one of the crew members', as he regularly shoots on LUMIX cameras--as do I. Noticed they shot on GH2s and so that hooked me in as well. They did a very great job on this project. Probably will revisit this awesomeness in the near future.

Great work peeps! ...oh and the performances. Jeez Canada...you guys don't play around lol. Tatiana kills it in this film, as well as the rest of the cast. Keep it up.",1378944000,5,529,4.3979591836734695
5625211,5,B00BIYQPBA,"i'll be honest - i've been on a tatiana maslany movie-watching spree. that being said, i can honestly say that tmas has great taste in the productions she chooses to play in. this is a great film that i'm glad i decided to pay to watch and am going to convince my friends to watch before the rental expires, lol. crazy-charming litte film that i'd easily recommend for a fulfilling sunday morning.",1374969600,6,397,4.527777777777778
5625212,5,B00BIYQPBA,Maslany did an amazing job portraying the journey of Claire's view on relationships and life in general. From not caring about school to actually begging to be let finish her senior year because she's finally found a reason to want more for herself is quite the development. Very entertaining and well written. Definitely would recommend.,1373241600,5,338,5.163636363636364
5625213,5,B00BIYQPBA,"""Picture Day"", an all-Canadian effort filmed in Ontario, follows ""Claire"" (Tatiana Maslany), a young woman straddling the line between childhood and adulthood, and ""Henry"" (Spencer Van Wyck), a precocious first-year high school student. ""Picture Day"" has received it's share of acclaim on the international film fest circuit, scooping up awards at Whistler (Philip Borsos Award, ""Best New Canadian Feature Film""), as well as RiverRun (Audience Choice Award). Long-time writer, first-time feature film director Kate Melville deftly manages a tight production budget, casts extremely capable leads, and gifts the aforementioned leads with sufficient artistic freedom to excel in their roles.

Versatile industry veteran Maslany (Orphan Black, Grown Up Movie Star, Toilet) provides her typical standout performance, imbuing her character with appropriate levels of insolence, promiscuity, and vulnerability. The technically-proficient and well-pedigreed (Gemini Award (2009), Critics' Choice Award (2013)) Maslany frequently taps into her extensive improv experience, to hilarious effect. Maslany-as-Claire is at her best when sarcastically challenging authority, expressing wonderment at ball asymmetry, and engaging in helium-infused, postcoitus riffing.

Van Wyck (Degrassi: The Next Generation) skillfully plays Claire's geektacular sidekick, capturing Henry's intelligence (and youthful ignorance). Van Wyck, oft-underutilized as ""Wesley"" on Degrassi, is much more memorable as Henry- feel free to add the up-and-coming Van Wyck to your radar. Real-life Canadian rock star Steven McCarthy (Elastocitizens) stars as Canadian rock star ""Jim"", and comedian Mark Debonis (""Best Stand-up Newcomer"", 11th Annual Canadian Comedy Awards (2010)) contributes well-timed deadpan humor as bingo maven ""Lewis"", without resorting to the boilerplate bingo hall humor so prevalent in modern cinema.

""Picture Day"" trailers and clips are sprinkled throughout the internets, and this film is definitely worth a watch (or ten).",1371340800,2,2010,6.27536231884058

8569213,3,B00BIYQPBA,She is SO MUCH better than this movie.,1491523200,,38,3.875
8569214,5,B00BIYQPBA,"This is engaging story about Claire, a troubled 18-year old repeating her senior year in high school.  The film is of particular interest because the star is Orphan Blacks Tatiana Maslany.  Though released in 2012 when she was 26, the production was filmed when she was 24.  Those searching for an earlier example of this actors brilliance will not be disappointed.  Maslanys depiction is every bit as profound as any work she does on Orphan Black and thus this film is a must see for her fans.",1484870400,,494,4.64367816091954
8569215,5,B00BIYQPBA,Tatiana Maslany is great.  This movie grabbed me slowly and had me fully involved by the end.,1473206400,,93,4.470588235294118

8569219,4,B00BIYQPBA,This may be a tough movie to watch if you are especially sensitive to individuals under the age of consent participating (both willingly and unwillingly) in sexual and drug situations. With that said I bought this movie mainly due to the presence of Tatiana Maslany in the cast. If you aren't familiar with her name or her most recent project (Orphan Black) do yourself a HUGE favor and get with the program. Ms. Maslany will likely be remembered long after I am gone as one of the finest actresses of this or any other generation. She is just THAT GOOD. I point of fact I have not watched the movie on the DVD yet as I had previously viewed the movie twice via streaming. I bought the hardcopy to vote FOR this very talented woman with my $$...and to have the movie as part of my permanent collection.,1436140800,3,802,4.425675675675675
