There are also some good interviews, all too brief, by Springsteen, himself, and a couple of others, speaking about these influences and his experience with them. That's the good part.

This is largely a talking-head film expressing the opinions of several people who apparently consider themselves Bruce scholars and/or pop music historians. After watching this film once, I'm not too impressed. It seems as though they have an agenda to push the tired old myth that Bruce Springsteen began with BORN TO RUN. One guy actually says that GREETINGS FROM ASBURY PARK was painfully derivative of Bob Dylan. Really? GROWING UP, MARY QUEEN OF ARKANSAS, SPIRITS IN THE NIGHT, HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY, when did Dylan sing anything like these? This same dude absolutely trashes BLINDED BY THE LIGHT, while failing to mention that it is the only Springsteen song that has ever been a number 1 hit single, albeit for Manfred Mann.

Then there's the guy who says that Springsteen was the first white act to actually strive to emulate black performers! I hate to wake you up, buddy, but listen sometime when you have the chance, to the first 5 Rolling Stones records. You'll hear very credible covers of pretty nearly all the black performers you claim Springsteen discovered.

There's also a long examination to what extent Van Morrison influenced Bruce Springsteen. The decision comes down to Morrison inspired Bruce to strive for strong, soulful lyrics and use horns in his band. This talking head, who says he's worked with both Van the Man & the Boss, classifies Morrison as introverted and Springsteen as extroverted stage performers. Well, yes, today Van Morrison lays back, closes his eyes and lets the music do the work. But in 1975, when Morrison recorded the seminal live album, TOO LATE TO STOP NOW, his act had the energy of James Brown's. Van Morrison performed two hours of heart pumping music, came back for two encores, then leaped into the air, came down in a full split shouting: It's too late to stop now, hence the title. That was the Van Morrison who influenced Bruce Springsteen. If you didn't see it, maybe you don't know it.

They also pick and choose which Springsteen albums to use to make their case. They agree that BORN TO RUN is where it started. They say that GREETINGS was lousy. No mention of THE WILD THE INNOCENT & THE E STREET SHUFFLE (SANDY?), no mention of DARKNESS AT THE EDGE OF TOWN. Get this, no mention at all of BORN IN THE USA!!! Say what? No mention of TUNNEL OF LOVE, no mention of DEVILS & DUST. THE GHOST OF TOM JOAD is too derivative of Woody Guthrie!? And that's how this video goes, these pat comments with no explanation or song comparisons so the viewer has some idea of what they think they're talking about. It seems like a bunch of guys talking out of their asses to me.

To sum up, this DVD will be of interest to Bruce fans and to those interested in the evolution of Rock & Roll up to Bruce Springsteen. One needs to take what these commentators say with a round canister of salt, however. Springsteen must have signed off on this because his music is extensively used in it. I wish he'd been more involved in its creative process.",1276732800,44,3320,4.658703071672355
8390367,3,B00376AVXK,"Under the Influence examines the foundations of Springsteen's craft and illustrates the huge influence that artists such as these have had on him throughout his career. This superb program also looks broadly at the political, literary and cultural influences that have affected New Jersey's favorite son, and all at once provides the most detailed and fascinating film ever made about Springsteen's inspiration. Featuring rare footage of Bruce and all of his favorites, alongside revealing archive interviews with The Boss himself, and insightful contributions from Vini Lopez and Gary Mallaber (ex of the E Street Band), Gary (US) Bonds, biographer Eric Alterman, Rolling Stone's Anthony De Curtis and numerous other associates, experts and influences. This film is both a detailed, academic look at Bruce Springsteen's artistic development and an entertaining and joyous celebration of his own music and that of the artists he loved most.",1273622400,19,940,5.534722222222222
