1001534,5,6305268843,"This is apparently quite an old movie and I had never even heard of it.  A friend has been nagging me to see it, assuring me that I would love it - but they way she described it did not wholley convince me.  Set in  Victorian Britain she mentioned how it involved invalid wives, an adopted  child, separation and forbidden love.  I thought it would be a down beat  Jane Eyre, but I was wrong.
This is a beautiful and really quite  uplifting film.  The acting is very strong and Sophie Marceau is surpringly  good as the passionate heroine who stands up, not only for her own  happiness but also for the happiness of her child. The characters have  unexpected depths and do not behave predictably.  It is also very set in a  lovely house in the depths of winter and it is visually a feast.  I am now  grateful to my friend for her recommendation and feel I should spread the  word.  Watch it while it is still available in video shops. I hope its  distributors decide to re-release it as I, for one, would like to own a  copy.",962409600,6,1025,4.272251308900524
1001535,4,6305268843,"Under the guise of ""an old-fashioned romance"", this incredibly beautiful film takes on some very controversial themes, including surrogate motherhood and euthanasia.  It explores the theme of motherhood in a way no  film has done before. Every word of the dialogue is freighted with meaning,  much of which requires a second viewing to receive fully.  Marceau and  Dillane make an enthralling couple, and their chemistry is unmistakable.",959731200,8,437,5.462686567164179

1001538,5,6305268843,"If you are a romantic, you will adore this movie. I never saw or heard of Stephen Dillane before but,( where has he been hiding?) I believe any female will fall in love with him. This movie kept my attention from the  moment it started until it ended. I saw it three times, and I also ordered  it from Amazon.com.

Everything about this movie, the dialogue, cast, performance, music, plot, chemistry and much more are  wonderfully done. I can't wait to own it when the DVD comes out. So far  there's only two history romance on my list, Dangerous Liaison and  Firelight. I wish I can see more movies like this one.",933206400,2,416,4.594594594594595
1001540,5,6305268843,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It has so much to offer on every level.  How Elizabeth  must have felt wondering where the baby had gone, only to find her beloved daughter seven years later and still not be  able to know her the way she wanted. Also, what Charles must have gone  through in his thoughts with Amy upstairs in a coma, never to come out of  it and feeling that he must get on with his life as he is financialy about  to lose everything. The setting is almost magical and set in my favorite  time period. The chemistry between Marceau and Dillane is superb. This is a  must see for anyone who has a passion for historical romances. I wanted to  buy it asap but unfortunatly it cost a fortune.  A lingering thought is  where did they go? To start a life in America? I cant imagine any other  end, can you?",930268800,4,835,4.14375

I don't want to give anything away  to those who haven't seen it, but I was so pleased with the ending.  I was  expecting something ""Shakespearean...""",925257600,2,337,4.566666666666666

It's beautiful, acting is supurb, from Sophie M to  Stephen D (my first time to see him, but he's on the top of my fav actor  list - now for sure) and on to their daughter.

1001543,5,6305268843,"Sadly, a classic example of what happens when ""Hollywood's"" corporate middle management indifference and ineptness -  prevails. Nobody hears of it. Nobody sees it. Fortunately, the damn fools have to try to get  their money back. Word of mouth alone should put the video release of this  motion picture on the map for all time. There is not a false note anywhere.  The performances - all of them - are magnificent. The emotional  underpinnings of Christopher Gunning's compositions are breathtaking. In  capturing even the minutest nuance, WILLIAM NICHOLSON has written and  directed a motion picture classic.",924480000,3,609,5.28125

1002209,5,6305268843,"""Firelight"" is a moving story about privilege, parenthood, and love in the early Victorian era. Elisabeth Laurier, a poor Swiss governess who has contracted to bear a child for an English aristocrat in return for a sizable sum of money to help out her father, has agreed to keep her role in the child's birth a secret. But as the years pass, she is unable to forget the cry of her daughter at birth; she goes in search of the child, now six years old and takes a job as her governess. When the father finds out, he is furious and gives her a month's notice to leave, but not before he shows her his wife, disabled for ten years in a riding accident and now little more than a vegetable. What happens in the subsequent month is a beautifully filmed story of love that will not be denied.
The acting is superb, and the scenes shot in the dead of an English winter, are exquisite. You really feel you are there in the bitter cold, warmed by the flame of sexual desire and a mother's love that will not be denied.",1453680000,3,1009,4.260416666666667

1002344,5,6305268843,"This is another wonderful movie with Stephen Dillane.  The acting is brilliant especially from Sophie Marceau.  It is always women that pay the price for the follies of men during those earlier times.  This is the tale of a governess, who being a dutiful daughter, decides to bear a child for a rich landowner in return for 500 pounds to pay for her father's debts.  She forms an attachment with the landowner but she made a promise to never see him or the child again.  She forms a bond when her daughter is born and even though the child is taken away, she never forgets her.  She keeps a journal to keep track of the child's birthdays.  Ms. Marceau conveys such raw emotion in her yearning to find her child.  I won't give the rest away because the story is wonderful with many moral dilemmas along the way.  The bleak scenery is a feast for the eyes.  This is a must watch movie.",1448582400,6,883,4.361963190184049

Sophie Marceau plays a Swiss governess who becomes the governess to the daughter of Mr. Godwin played by Stephen Dillane. The governess knows secrets about this family which moves the plot along. It is the secrets which have brought her there. But what keeps you watching is the growing love story between the two leads. This is filmed in the gorgeous English countryside during a stark but splendid winter, which is a perfect backdrop to the piece. The leads have great chemistry throughout.

The mating takes place over a three day period and true, the ground rules were made quite clear, but rules and the heart often go in different directions. After the child is born and delivered to the father, Marceau's character is unable to let go and searches for her ""English"" daughter. It takes her seven years to locate her daughter and is hired  as a governess for the child.  The father is furious and suspecious of her motives but reluctantly agrees to a trial arrangement.  The hostile and lonely child is won over and so is the father who is also lonely.  This is a delicious love story and I L-O-V-E it.

1002907,5,6305268843,"This movie captivated me the first time I saw it because it's a story of ordinary people trying to cope with extra-ordinary circumstances. The way they help each other solve their problems might be viewed as immoral by some, but their coming together cracks the cocoons in which they've wrapped themselves. Is it right to live the life others think is moral and proper? Or is it better to allow oneself to express passion desire and love to it's fullest?

The fact that the movie takes place in the winter is no accident. The outer world is cold. Even the rooms of the house in 1830s England are cold and sparsely furnished. The exceptions to this are the school room and Elisabeth's room. In these rooms firelight is abundant, illuminating the inner lives of the characters who enter. This is enhanced by the portrayals of the characters. The acting has a light touch.  Emotions are deeply buried and only come out slowly as Elisabeth, the foreigner, moves forward with her deep desire to get to know the daughter she gave up so many years before. Of course the flame that was lit between she and Charles fares again, and what was once a nice comfortable, boring life, is transformed into one of passion and love.

The movie is a quiet character study with a satisfying ending.",1406851200,2,1278,4.646017699115045

1002959,4,6305268843,"Tucked away and steaming on Amazon is a period movie lost in the crowd - Firelight - filmed in 1997. It was written and directed by William Nicholson. Who is he, you ask? He is a novelist, playwright, and screenwriter who co-authored Gladiator, wrote Shadowlands, Nell, First Knight, and many others. The story is extremely different for a period film, yet Bronte-type familiar in its plot.

It begins with a single woman from Switzerland, named Elizabeth, in an interview with an elderly lady and an unidentified man in a chair who she cannot see. The position is unlike any job a woman would take in 1838 England. She agrees to father the stranger a child for the sum of 500 pounds and walk away giving him the baby and promising never to see him or the child again. Her motive for agreeing to do such an immoral act is only explained by one sentence - her father needs the money.

When she finally meets her employer in a discreet location by the ocean, they have sex for three nights in a row. (Prepare yourself for moaning and full breast scenes.) She knows nothing about him - his name, where he lives, and why he is seeking a child in an immoral tryst when he is married. At first, it is a cold and detached union with one purpose - to impregnate her. However, by the third time, the two see each other as individuals and form a fragile attachment that is quickly severed by their parting. Nine months later, she bears him a little girl, which she never has the opportunity to hold or see.

The story picks up eight years later with huge gaps and unexplained backstory that you are left to fill in on your own. Suddenly, Elisabeth shows up on Charles Godwin's doorstep who is the father of their child. She has been hired as a governess and meets her daughter for the first time. He is appalled that she has broken her promise and quickly goes to dismiss her but gives her one month's notice. Elizabeth is horrified to find a bratty little girl, Louisa, who is disrespectful and unschooled because governess after governess gives up on the unruly child.

Then the story takes an unseen twist. Charles is still married to a woman who lies in a coma after a riding accident ten years earlier. Like the mad wife of Edward Rochester in Jane Eyre, she is tucked away in a room, lying in a bed, unresponsive with open eyes, a paralyzed body, and the inability to move or talk. (Of course, medically speaking because she's been that way for ten years, unable to swallow food or water, you have to believe the story is plausible. It takes a bit of imagination on your part. During that era, I doubt she would have survived but a few months.)

Nevertheless, the story continues. Elizabeth forges a relationship with her daughter, but swears to Charles not to tell her the truth. As the days pass, Charles and Elisabeth rekindle their affections for one another and begin a sexual affair. So what happens next? Well, I'm not going to spoil it for you.

It's a strange plot with a lot of holes and unexplained twists and turns. The affair between Charles and Elisabeth is understandable because of their odd relationship of having had a child together. Charles is obviously lonely and love-starved because of his unresponsive wife. Elizabeth sees Charles as the man who took her virginity, gave her a child, and who she fell in love with when they first met. Louisa is angry for having no mother and obviously acting out due to her own inward pain.

Regardless of the plot holes, the movie does have endearing qualities and touching points. You can identify with the character's emotions and their motivations. However, in the end you will be left to judge the outcome on your own - was it right or wrong and will God have mercy on their souls?",1404000000,7,3740,4.540059347181009

1003219,2,6305268843,"A ridiculous soap opera of a plot. I guess I should have known what I was getting myself into, but I was hoping for a better developed relationship between the mother and child. The child actress was forced and stilted, and you didn't see scenes where mother and daughter truly connected. Nor did you see Louisa's attitude reform--there was only one significant discipline and growth scene but that didn't go very far. There was potential for that plot to develop--all of the mother's grand lines about learning to read and escaping the prison of womanhood--but instead they just went back to the lust plot line. And even though Louisa sees what is happening between her father and her governess, we don't see how that affects her. The fall into the ice and Sophie's rescue occurs, but it doesn't seem to enrich or expand their relationship.

And if Louisa's just managed to read the word ""hat,"" how could she have suddenly read ""To my English Daughter""? And what did the Charles' father add to anything? Plus, the ending was horrifying--after 10 years of caring for his wife, Charles now decides (in the heat of passion) that she probably wouldn't want to live any way? Come on.

An annoying, unfulfilling, shallow story.",1371945600,2,1222,4.814285714285714

Her mother had died in childbirth, and she was raised by her dad. They don't tell you what he did, but her dad is in prison and she needed money to get him out. She could either marry well and have them pay to get her father out of prison (but then she'd be bound to that person for the rest of her life) - or she could sell herself short term, discreetly, and then get on with her life.  She choose the latter by way of agreeing to  carry a strangers child (he needed an heir) for a generous price - not knowing who he was or where that child went. She would only know of course that the child would be raised in a wealthy home. They spent 3 nights together and went their separate ways. When the time came for her to deliver, arrangements had been made with a woman to see to the delivery and the immediate whisking away of the baby to its father. ...A rather cold arrangement.

What she hadn't counted on was how much that baby would mean to her - though she never saw it, just heard the midwives say it was a girl and hearing her first cry when her bottom was slapped before the women scurried off with her.  She clung to the memory of her child's cry and made pretty pictures in an album remembering the birthdays etc...to someday give to her child. And she spent 7 years searching for her.

She finally finds a position as governess for her daughter, who is a complete brat and runs nannies/governesses off in short order.  When the child's father comes home from a business trip and is introduced to the new governess his sister-in-law hired - he (of course) recognizes her, freaks and says she must leave.  Unfortunately, they must give 1 month's notice so that the governess may find another working/living arrangement elsewhere, so he's stuck with her for 1 month.

Within that time, she makes progress with the child and they develop a bond, and romance is kindled with the father.

Not really a unique/special story, and the physical love scenes leave a lot to be desired.  Then there's the not-too-well-thought-out story of his wife ""who didn't die"" - she's in a coma for 10 yrs however back in those days there was no way they could've kept her alive for 10 yrs in her condition as they didn't do intravenous feeding and even if by some miracle they got broth down her throat, it's not likely they could've made her last 10 years.

I received it earlier then promised when ordered and watched it last night.....it is still a wonderful story about longing and a deep love between the characters. The couple Elisabeth and Charles find the magic of Firelight brings them together and the seven-year old daughter Louisa finds the joy of finally having a mother in her life (what a little brat she is throughout movie, until her discovery). It had an ending with the three of them starting a new life together...wish there was a sequel to find out more.  The actors Sophie Marceau, Stephen Dillane and Dominique Delacourt were the right ones chosen for the parts. If you are a romantic at heart or just enjoy a good movie, you would enjoy Firelight.

1003516,3,6305268843,"Firelight, with all its initial unrequited passions, is mainly an amoral Jane Eyre but is thoroughly entertaining. Beautifully directed by William Nicholson and acted by the entire cast, especially Sophie Marceau as the governess Elisabeth Laurier and Stephen Dillane as the aristocratic Charles Godwin, individual scenes are certain to stay with the more sensitive viewer.

But the happy, hopeful ending -- spoiler alert! -- is based upon the murder of a comatose patient by hypothermia. Why is the window wide open in winter? Who put out the fire? Does anyone care? (The patient's previous ten-year survival is itself most remarkable for 1830s England. For starters, how is this patient fed? Feeding tubes??? The scriptwriter, apparently, doesn't want viewers to think about such unromantic things, but for no-nonsense old me, they are troubling). In fact, the entire denouement is much too facile and glosses over anything that gets in the way of the two stars' raging hormones, including the murder of a comatose spouse and the earlier lack of reaction from a little girl who discovers that her beloved daddy is schtupping the governess.

But jumping from the end back to the beginning, the less-than-subtle symbolism is really fun. For example, the aristocrat doesn't rest upon his ancestral laurels but is an avid sheep breeder. This, of course, is what triggers in him the idea of obtaining an heir though hiring a surrogate for breeding purposes. And thus, in a nice, neat Thomas Hardy way, the fun really gets started.",1321056000,3,1527,5.128514056224899

When I first watched Firelight, I was wondering how come I had never heard of it before...and felt strangely betrayed, as if left out of a special secret that some people knew about but I didn't. I am a huge fan of Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, Pride and Prejudice and nearly all other Hollywood, Masterpiece Theatre, or BBC productions of the same genre: scenic English countrysides, heart-wrenching romances,period pieces, etc. This movie was so spellbinding that I've watched it three times in less than a month and bought three copies to keep and give as gifts. Also, this is no ordinary ""chick flick"" as the guys who see it are also emotionally moved. I am looking forward to checking out the newest version of Jane Eyre (2011), but I believe Firelight will remain my new favorite movie for a long, long time. By way of information, I hate gratuitous sex scenes, and while this movie has sex scenes, they are tastefully done and move the story along...in other words, they are not randomly tossed in like spare change.

Sophie Marceau is not only the world's most seductive woman, she engrosses you throughout with her amazing portrayal of an estranged mother who's lost her child. Stephen Dillane is perfect for the aristocratic lover/sperm donor. Unlike Scorsese's Age of Innocense, I can never get enough of this one.

This one has few false notes, and re notes, the score is so lovely I went to considerable trouble to find it and purchase it. This movie does have a bit of a Jane Eyre feel. The only slightly false note is the daughter is hard to warm up to, because her part is written so that she is really obnoxious, just a hair of jumping the shark here. But Sophie and the score are so wonderful you can ignore any minor hitches. This one is worth buying, and so is the score, if you can find either one.

1003583,5,6305268843,"I don't understand how Best Picture and Best Performance by an Actress were not awarded this film.  Sophie Marceau's is the best film performance of its decade.  She has an extremely difficult role and realizes every possibility in it.  The script owes a great deal to Charlotte Bronte, but is nonetheless original.  The director/writer has unified the story by putting the mother/daughter relationship at the center.  He builds this plot line to a truly great scene near the end of the film.  In early versions of the movie, there is a sequence where the Marceau character--named Elizabeth--dances with the male lead in a ballroom while upper-class snobs look on in disapproval.  In later cuts, this scene is wisely eliminated to throw more emphasis on the private dance that follows.  Stephen Dillane renders a sympathetic treatment of an introverted, brooding aristocrat.  Some of the character's harshness makes sense only within his moodiness.  Had Dillane not underscored this note in the character, he would have been too unsympathetic to deserve the love of Marceau's Elizabeth.  The movie is beautifully filmed, rightly giving much screen time to Marceau's amazing face and command of formal period movement.  She is graceful without becoming dancer-ish or stiff.  Her English is impeccable.  Had Marceau never done another movie, this one alone would establish her as a great actress.",1292889600,2,1394,5.248868778280543

The soundtrack, which isn't commercially available, is beautiful and haunting, from the dramatic opening to the very last note of the last track. Having recently seen Sophie Marceau in ""Anna Karenina,"" I knew how good she is in a period piece and though this film isn't exactly one where costumes take center stage, it's a beautiful movie nonetheless. Sophie Marceau is perfect as the mother, evoking passion, pain and love all in one. The rest of the cast is also spot-on. Every scene is meticulously shot and beautifully filmed, especially the scenes of passion amidst the firelight. I highly recommend this movie. Should have been rated PG-13 instead of R, because in the case of this movie, the nudity is essential to the story and moves the plot along.",1285545600,2,849,4.821917808219178

Every one of the actors & actresses in this move do a fantastic job of making this movie watchable, especially Ms Marceau who is both talented & beautiful. Her range is fairly broad considering the work she has done i.e. from Bond villanese to Shakespeare's Hypolitta & she certainly pulls this movie together by being a kind of Maypole that everyone else moves around.

She keeps the bargain for 7 years, then tracks them down, and stays in his house with the daughter and his comatose wife.  They resume their intimate relations.  Husband kills wife.  They lament what he did but say it was worth it, and fall into each others' arms.  Daughter discovers her real mom and tells mom she's glad she was sold for a high price vs. a low one--mom and daughter joyfully unite and all 3 ride off into the sunset.  I gave this 2 stars because it was very predictable, and after several hearts were broken and one person killed in order for them to get together, I  could take no joy in their romance.

She plays Elizabeth Laurier, a Swiss woman, who needs a large amount of money to get her father out of prison. Given the limited opportunities of women at the time she agrees to carry a man's baby for him, since his wife was unable to (she was comatose). Elizabeth falls in love with the baby she had to give up and the man with whom she had a 3-night tryst. The rest of the movie shows her determination to locate them. After which with love and discipline she tames her daughter who does not know who this nanny is. She also slowly reconnects with the man who was absolutely shocked and angered to see her again. Firelight plays a supporting role to give atmosphere. It is understated but there. While all this is going on the sister-in-law has her hopes to get her sister's husband after her sister's death. The man's father bankrupts the family. Through all the goings on, Elizabeth maintains her dignity even though she is poor and without any other resources except her artistic talents, courage and love.

Don't get me wrong, it was still very good but after all that expectation, I was a little let down by the ending.  I almost feel like it was a set up for a series that never occurred.  I loved Sophie but was a little surprised by the nude scenes which were apparently edited on the cable version I saw first.  Didn't much care for the child's character as someone else mentioned in a prior review.  The girl's father was also not quite the heart throb I remembered.  He let his own father treat him so poorly and didn't seem able to make important decisions that counted.  It was a little hard to believe he generated such feeling from Sophie's character.

The movie is shamefully ""out of print"" and as such this is the only way to get it. Most movies shelved in a distant back room and forgotten about by the studio aren't worth importing, but this one is.

""Firelight"" is a movie that most people love for many reasons. I personally like the controversial plot that is established with the opening scene -- in which a beautiful young woman, Elisabeth, is questioned by an unseen gentlemen in order to be considered ""worthy"" of bearing his illegitimate child. The man, whose name we later learn is Charles, has lost his wife in a terrible horseback riding accident, leaving her comatose. He is for all intensive purposes, trapped, both by his libertine father's mounting debts and his inability to remarry, but his principles refuse to allow him to take a mistress, and so he wants a child to provide him with the love and affection the rest of his family cannot provide.

Their first encounter is ""business"" in which she remains cold and withdrawn and he is understandably shy and distant. But somewhere between their curious conversations over the three days spent on the coast, and their second and third encounter, something sparks between them. Elisabeth is driven by remorse that she can never see him again, nor experience this kind of love for real, and he too takes delight in her. Seven years later, she turns up on his doorstep wanting to act as a governess to their daughter, and it all unfolds from there.

Movies like this must be cautious or risk offending their audience -- and even as we might morally question the actions of the characters, the writer/director has done such a tremendous job that we are fond of them, fond enough to forgive and understand even their most shocking actions. Casual intimacy that turns out to be not-so-casual after all is not the only thing to raise your eyebrows, since also involved is a murder... or a mercy killing, however you wish to look at it.

Everything about this production is exquisite. Gorgeous exterior shots, beautiful colors in the house contrasted with the bleak English countryside, lingering glances across lavish drawing rooms. The dialogue is marvelous, from his tentative observation that the light of the fire gives off more illumination than he expected to their passionate arguments. The performances are also flawless and have incredible chemistry. When they finally tenderly kiss, it is more erotic than most graphic love scenes. Which brings me to the love scenes... all things considered, they are not as graphic as one would expect. In fact, more movies would do well to learn something from them, because it is filmed as a union as much of mind as body, rather than one filled with explicit movement or moaning, and that, in my opinion, is what makes it so sexy.

I saw this many years ago and then recently, and had to purchase the import because I love it so much. So suspend your disbelief, forgive its few faults, and become enraptured with a ""Jane Eyre""-esque Victorian Gothic Romance.",1244851200,7,3130,4.799628942486085

1003674,4,6305268843,"Like most reviewers, I was hardly bowled over. It was a good movie, period.
There are several wonderful aspects that deem mention. Sophie Marceau and Stephen Dillane  were outstanding. From their expression to dialogue delivery...everything was faultless.
The cinematography was superb and the editing was brilliant.
Why the four stars? - Because the movie is supposed to revolve around the power of desire both maternal and sexual. The latter is the one aspect I found lacking in the movie. The intimate scenes, in my opinion, seemed like forced and very brief and were not carnal. I could not even find poignancy in them. Physical desire is after all about passion and poignancy. A lot can be achieved without nudity in my opinion.
Sophie's dealings with her daughter, on the other hand were a different story. Very few actors can provide the expression that she did in the final scene with her daughter. The same can be said for Stephen Dillane, in his interaction with his invalid wife.
Somehow the romance between the protagonists stood cold for me. It should have been more pronounced to justify the actions and outcomes that make up the storyline.
The character of the sister in law was one thing that got me thinking. I am glad that the film portrayed women as it did.
In summary - pretty good.",1237507200,2,1302,4.8125
1003714,5,6305268843,"""Firelight"" is one of my favorite films.  I call it a classic, although many have never heard of it.  I recently showed it to the acting class I teach and the room broke out in applause at the closing credits.  With my videocassette copy quickly becoming outdated, I decided to get a DVD.  William Nicholson directed this.  He has two Oscar nominations for his screenplays for ""Shadowlands"" & ""The Gladiators.""  ""Firelight"" is certainly lyrical, moving slowly.  But it builds with such a certain steady climb with the rising action that by its climax, we hate to stop watching.  I think this is Sophie Marceau's shining moment, despite excellent appearances as Princess Isabelle in ""Brave Heart"" & as Polina Delacroix in ""Alex & Emma.""  As Elisabeth, she is mesmerizing.  Her intensity is so subtle yet gloriously clear.  One moment where she looks at a bare Charles rising from a swim, she catches her breath just a little and then struggles for control.  Stephan Dillane plays Charles Godwin.  I recently saw him in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Savage-Grace/dp/B001F0TM4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Savage Grace</a>.

As Charles, his performance also is a tightly controlled one that seeks to explode once behind closed doors.  Dominique Belcourt plays their daughter Louisa, sassy & unruly.  Lia Williams who was recently in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Christmas-Miracle-of-Jonathan-Toomey/dp/B000UAE7P4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey</a>&nbsp;plays the sister-in-law Constance.  Hers is another subtle but riveting performance.  Kevin Anderson from Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre & whose first film was as Tom Cruise's buddy in ""Risky Business"" plays John Taylor, an Ohio farmer striking up a deal.  Joss Ackland who was in ""Shadowlands"" plays Charles' father Lord Clare.  I pull this film out and watch it every year or so.  It never fails to grip me, even as I begin to know it frame by frame.

To compare it with something familiar to movie viewers I would say it has a lot in common with `Jane Eyre' with a little touch of the American tale `The Miracle Worker.'

Sophie Marceau is not only beautiful as expected, but delivers a very emotional, controlled performance as the new governess to a wealthy Englishman's child who also happens to be her own daughter. Stephen Dillane also provides a superior performance as the little girls Father and is the perfect choice for Sophie's love interest.

Even well educated woman had few opportunities rather than marry and become the property of their husbands.  Fans of the the Romance genre, and Period pieces in general, will not be disappointed.

1003790,5,6305268843,"I was channel surfing a few months ago and just happened to arrive at the right channel at the right time to see this absolute gem of a film.  I thought I'd try it out and go on, but I was almost immediately entranced and couldn't look away.  I even set my clock and got up in the middle of the night to record it so I could watch it again the next day (which I did).  I had never seen any of the actors before, with the exception of the American, whose role as an observer and as a pointer to their eventual destination, seemed key to the story.  I was very impressed by every performance, each of which was so low-key and nuanced as to be a thing of beauty.  I was also knocked out by the honesty of each of the characters.  The dialogue was rather sparse, so the story had to be told in many scenes by the actors' faces, the tension in their bodies, and I have never heard such a wealth of meaning conveyed in the many one-word lines.  Such unflinching honesty is a rare thing in any age, but in this time period when so many people used words as a screen to hide their real thoughts, it must have been quite out of the ordinary to speak the truth as each character did, no matter the consequences.  I fell in love with all the characters - the lovers and their child - his sister-in-law and father - the young American - even the maid and the elderly butler who couldn't bend to the fire because his wig would fall off.  And the scene where the little girl asks her mother why she gave her away?  I've seen this movie half a dozen times and I still get goosebumps just thinking about it.

Yes, I found this to be the absolutely perfect love story.  I wouldn't change a word or a look, and the photography and the music simply rounded out the whole.

Their agreement is that he will take the child back to his home in England, and she will not ever see the child again. However, she eventually does, and it goes on from there. To me, this is a sweet and poignant film. And one of the best features of this movie is the soundtrack by Alexander Desplat. I had to buy it, when I bought the movie.

For romantics, this is a one-der-ful film. I would also recommend, with Stephen Dillane, ""DeJaVu.""",1177459200,9,733,4.389705882352941
1003840,5,6305268843,"In 1838 young Swiss governess Elisabeth Laurier enters into a private arrangement with an unnamed British gentleman, brokered by the matronly Mrs. Jago, possibly a midwife. She will bear him a child in return for a large sum of money. Unable to have children with his incapacitated wife, he (Charles) chooses the surrogate mother with the care of one practiced in animal husbandry. Miss Laurier is an intelligent, healthy young woman whose father is in debt, perhaps in debtor's prison. She chooses to raise the sum to free her father by bearing a child rather than to ""sell myself for life"" in a marriage of convenience to a rich man. Subtle and beautiful, this carefully choreographed film doesn't waste words or gestures. Seven years have passed when the story resumes, and Elizabeth has finally traced her child to this estate and been hired as the latest  governess. After minor setbacks, she quickly insinuates herself into a parental role with the misbehaving Louisa, despite Charles' unsuccessful attempt to see her off the property. Lord Clare, Charles' father, lives high in London, borrowing money against the estate and counseling Charles that living ones' life for pleasure is the only thing that matters. He polkas the property into the hands of the moneylenders (think ""Scrooge and Marley"" here!)  Frank and drastic choices must be made by all.

It was unfortunate that the lion's share of published reviews were written by critics who clearly didn't understand the literary back story of British culture at the time this film is set. The trick to ""getting it"" is to be a reader of 19th century British novels. I recommend Bronte, Austen, Hardy, Dickens, and a smattering of the books by twentieth century British historian and Regency romance writer Georgette Heyer. This film isn't a bodice ripper, nor is it a knock-off of Jane Eyre; the presence of a comatose wife is not sufficient to hold up the comparison, unless Jane Eyre is allowed to meld with The French Lieutenant's Woman. The screenplay is, instead, reminiscent of a story that could come from the pen of Thomas Hardy. Much remains unsaid in this film, but falls in the realm of ""understood"" by those familiar with the literature of the period. An unmarried pregnant gentlewoman cannot work as a governess and must keep her pregnancy secret, possibly in the country or confined indoors, out of the public eye. She would have been supported by the father, possibly in the company of Mrs. Jago, the midwife, for the year of  pregnancy and recovery. Finding a chink to learn the identity of the father would not be impossible, and the story flows in a logical manner. I disagree with another viewer who doesn't like the child actor in the role of the daughter Louisa. She acts the role of a willful, spoiled child so well that I think the reviewer missed the fact that she was acting also. You're supposed to dislike this child in the beginning.

The staging of this film is as remarkable as the story. Prior to this film, I didn't know who Stephen Dillane was. Since viewing this one, I have discovered other of his performances, and am amazed at his natural movement from one character to another. I hear he is fabulous on stage. Unlike many actors who play themselves in every film, Dillane makes every performance original and entirely natural. Likewise with Marceau; her manner, speech, and gestures are unique to each film she makes. The supporting cast were exemplary, and the attention to set details must be credited, I think, to the screenwriter and director, William Nicholson. One would think that his ability to create such a movie would propel him into more directorial endeavors, but though he loved the resulting film, it failed at the box office, and he hasn't pursued any more directing. Too bad!

There are times in the film when British and French accents are slightly difficult to understand by this American ear. I found that viewing this film the first time with subtitles cleared up the problem. The only version of this film available to purchase today that will work in region 1 DVD players is a Hong Kong NTSC release that is formatted to TV. A recent wide-screen European Region 2 release is a hopeful sign of renewed interest--perhaps it will cross the pond and be available here again in its full theatrical format. Decryption software is available for download and purchase in order to watch this film on a computer's DVD player, masking the region code. It is an extra measure of work in order to view this film, but wide screen is definitely best. This sleeper deserves to be rescued and re-released.",1176940800,22,4609,4.850063532401525

Lovely music, fits the mood, and beautiful scene's.  I think all the actor's did a marvelous job; you truly believe their emotions.  I don't care whether the wife wouldn't have survived that long in the 1800's, and I don't care if the ice looked like styrofoam (as someone suggested) (it looked like ice to me - I never once didn't feel the cold water as the mother struggled to get to her daughter - it was very realistic in my mind.)  I give it an A+++.  Beautifully done; too bad there aren't more movies like this.  One point to remember to all the really picky reviewers:  In Shakespeare's day the women's parts were played by men, no-one cared about great accuracy.  The play was the thing!  You are supposed to use your heart and head and not just your eyes.  When you read a book there ususally aren't pictures (unless you're a child.)

I will say this;  I first really became aware of Stephen Dillane in this film, and while it is definitely slanted to be the female character's tale, and Sophie Marceau is great in it, I was struck by the perfection of Mr. Dillane's expressions at certain moments.  On watching again, I rather wished that we had seen more of his reactions to her, rather than the many shots in which we clearly see her face, and his is either hidden or in profile.  I think that he is one of the most under-rated actors around; he has the ability to embody the characters that he plays to such a degree that his acting is totally true and natural.  Perhaps that is the reason that he hasn't achieved the fame his skills deserve, he is one of those who can make you forget he is acting -- he makes it seem easy and real.",1170028800,13,1014,4.3052631578947365

The one he chooses is a lovely, impoverished Swiss governess (the luminous Sophie Marceau) who agrees to the deal in order to bail her own father out of financial difficulties. Once the child is born, she is taken away from the mother and given over to the care of the father.  The agreement is that they will never meet again. But the Swiss governess deeply regrets giving up her baby, and by the time the child is seven, she manages to track her down and gets herself hired on as a governess. Once there, she finds that the child's father has spoiled her rotten, and she sets out to right the situation, of course falling in love with her child's father in the process.

The love scenes are passionate and engrossing, without ever stepping over the line into prurience (far more interesting than anything on late night Cinemax!). The way the plot plays out is deeply interesting. Of course, I found myself thinking as the movie drew to a close that some of the situations were dealt with in a rather anti-climactic fashion (you'd think that there would be a bit more drama surrounding the jilted sister-in-law and the swim through an icy lake, plus if it were me, I think I'd be a bit more upset if I found out my mother had sold me for five hundred pounds even if she did come looking for me afterwards), but all in all, a very satisfying and sexy movie.

The subject matter could have become tawdry if not handled well, which it was. All the characters had their place, even the American who offered Charles an option of a place to go, to be free of all the pretense and obligation of his life, being also a main theme of the story, obligation and responsibility, as well as the desire to break free of them.  And watch it several times, the nuances that come out are amazing and also listen to the background talk, some interesting facts come out which help you understand the characters and stories even more.  I actually watch it with headphones on to hear all the conversations going on.  And Charles, watch his facial expressions, they are absolutely priceless and perfect. My father actually sat and watched it, and trust me he's a ESPN guy, not romance movies. Anyway, it was just amazingly beautiful and passionate.",1157500800,13,975,4.624277456647399

1003909,5,6305268843,"{Sigh.} This is a sleeper movie that catches the viewer completely by surprise.  ""Passion has no limits"" proclaims the movie soundtrack which is now out of print and nearly impossible to find.  That statement is correct and the viewer finds themselves caught up completely in the storyline, such as it is, waiting in anticipation for the next clandestine rendezvous of the two lovers.  Who cares if the story is not historically correct or if the acting is not Oscar-worthy.  Sophie Marceau is in her element here, and Stephen Dillane, while not a super-stud, is still perfect for the part and is a believable partner for Sophie.  As for Louisa, the child is spoiled, obnoxious and difficult to feel sympathy for, but she is a creation of her environment and what her father made her to be.

There are two flaws in this movie is the wife that is in a coma. Why the desperation for an heir if the wife is comatose and near death?  Re-marriage and children are always an option.  I thought this part of the movie was unbelieveable and silly.  The screenwriters could have come up with something better. But, ah - I am being picky here.  The second flaw is Louisa in the lake house, which was boring, and my attention drifted.

The music in the movie is haunting and beautiful.  The music is composed by Christopher Gunning and the violin solos strike the heart and remain in your memory.

I recommend this movie and also the soundtrack.  A+  Five Stars",1113004800,9,1450,4.631372549019608

I rented this a few years back with my mom and we loved it! Too bad it's not on DVD in the US. I ordered mine from asia. But everyone must see this film!

1003938,5,6305268843,"The story might be remininscent of Jane Austen, particularly so when the setting was England in 1840. Yet other than the setting and costume, everything else is modern, the theme and the plot and the rhythm, everything. The main theme here is about desire and obligation or duty or the conflict between the soul and lust. As such, one just fails to see any connotation with DH Lawerence. It would rather remind us of Dr Zhivago instead.
We have everything we possibly could expect from any movie: sound, sight, drama, everything. We have an excellent cast plus exquisite acting, including spendrift Lord, the good natured sister-in-law and even the stubborn and wayward 8 years old Louisa, not just the hero and the heroine. And the dialogues and the language including the dramatic ironies are just intriguing. As the story unfolds itself, it was clear that it was not simply a deal for money. The penniless girl, whose mother died at her birth and was raised up by her father, and she was trying to save her beloved father who was sent to jail because of a debt. It was because of her duty to her father.
The softest spot of all would rather be Charles' wife: back in 1840 there was no way that a human vegetable could be so decently maintained, the least of would be the look of her eyes which were so crytal clear. This perhaps is due the artistic requirements of the movie as a whole. But this is a very small point indeed. Yet, who can possibly blame the husband who had been mourning the virtual death of his wife for 10 whole years, when his love and attention had turned to his own lively daughter? His own worldly father says his is ""abnomral"" being so dutiful. If anybody ever says the turn is not convincing, he obviously has not known life yet.
Sophie had given life to her part in a most remarkable way here (and so did the young girl and her father). I have seen Sophie in another movie, shot quite a number of years back, which was not eqaully impressing as this.
All in all, we can't ask for more from this movie. It is almost as good as the Polish movies like Blue, Red and White. What puzzles me is, why isn't this released on DVD in US yet? Fortunately enough, we do have it in Asia.",1086998400,12,2203,4.415233415233415
1003939,5,6305268843,"this is a good movie and good acting...

1003940,4,6305268843,"4.5 stars.  The one thing I've noticed about films set in England is that the pace of the film is exquisitely deliberate, like a great novel unfolding before my eyes. ""Firelight"" is no exception to this axiom.  The pace is slow yet fluid and flows so well that I was actually disappointed when the film ended.  I kept thinking, ""What happens next?""  I was eager for the story to continue, which is the sign of an exceptional film.  However, this is not perfect, like so many reviewers here suggest.  It is nearly so.  The most obvious flaw is when Sophie Marceau is wading out into the water, breaking the ice to get to her daughter who just fell through.  The ice is fake, to put it simply, looking more like chunks of styro-foam than shards of broken ice.  Something else that bothered me was that Sophie's lover's wife is totally catatonic....and she is still alive in 1837?  It is hardly likely, being as unresponsive as she was, that she would have survived 10 years in that day and age.  They never showed her eating or doing anything during the course of the film, apparently asking the audience to think she survives on willpower alone. Also, when she finally passes, with a little assistance, the husband doesn't grieve very long for one who claimed to love her so dearly.  Sure, he is relieved of the burden, but a long-lost love just died.  I would be torn up, even if I hadn't spoke to her for 10 years.  She was there all along, a constant reminder of a great love that was once vibrant and alive.  But those inconsistencies, and other smaller and more insignificant moments, cannot take away from the fact that this is an elegant film with superb photography, great costumes and set design, and a passionate performance from the undeniable star of this engaging film, Sophie Marceau.  She uses so much subtlety in her work here that the end result is pure magnificence. The best part of this film is the ending, not that I wanted it to end.  Most British melodramas insist on a tragic ending, but to my delight and surprise this film does not embrace that convention.  Overall, this is a wonderful film, reminiscent of Charlotte Bronte's ""Jane Eyre,"" and definately worth a look.",1080259200,19,2193,4.608247422680412
1003941,5,6305268843,"Firelight is a stunningly beautiful film, a real work of the cinematic art, that is successful on many levels.
The plot is compelling.  A young penniless girl accepts a deal to bear a child for a wealthy aristocrat in return for payment.  In the course of their ""business deal"" are sown the seeds of a potential relationship.  But this is nipped in the bud.  A child is born and duly handed over.
But the child acts as a magnet, drawing the mother in a search for her daughter, in her adopted role as governess.  And at last, she tracks down her daughter, and her erstwhile lover, to his estate, where he lives with his invalid wife.
Can she, in the role of governess, capture the love of her unruly and wayward daughter?  Can she live under the roof of her daughters father and maintain a distance?
The central theme of the film is Desire.  How strong and what a terrible thing is desire, that can tear up families, ruin estates and cause good men to kill?  As universal a question as can be found.
All of this is the makings of a good film, but what elevates it to excellence are the cinematography and Sophie Marceau in the lead role.
In firelight, we are told, when the lamps are turned off, time stands still.  And when the lamps are lit, and time starts again, what occurred by firelight is not only forgotten, but is as though it never happened.  By firelight the film is all yellows, browns and reds, warm and passionate.  The rooms small and cosy, filled with life and light.  But in daylight all is blue and grey, stark and cold.  The rooms are large, cold and empty.  Charles comments ""All these grand rooms and we live our lives within three feet of the fire"".  By day the film moves with the pace of a Jane Austen or a Bronte novel.  It is reminiscent of Stanley Kubricks film of Barry Lyndon, austere, paced, measured, like Bach or Hayden.  By firelight everything softens and warms and relaxes.  All of this is achieved by the cinematography.
Marceau is now well know for her roles in Braveheart and The James Bond: World is Not Enough.  But this is a far more personal performance, more crafted.  And she is, if anything, more beautiful for being stilted in her environment.  She is the making of the film.  Stephen Dillane is excellent as her counterpart, but the low interest at the box office possibly had much to do with the fact that he is not the typical Mr Darcy character you would expect.  He is not tall, not dark and not handsome.  And yet, he is perfect in the role as the disapproving son of a spendthrift lord, the loyal husband of  a wife who is a vegetable, and the overindulgent father of a wayward daughter.
As films go, this is a class act.  A lesson to film makers, and a great movie to watch.  Don't forget your tissues!",1078876800,7,2757,4.407920792079208

Disgusting.  Dillane's father (his name escapes me) talks of living life only for simple pleasures... we are meant to frown upon him and smile at Dillane for being so much more of a man for living life for deep pleasure.

Watch closely Sophie Marceau's face as she views her child for the very first time.  This is a day that would probably never happen!  What might this English daughter be like?  What is her name?  What is her face?  Marceau's thoughts and feelings pass over her face like a whisper, yet so poignantly.  This movie is full of such instances.  Stephen Dillane's face when he sees Elisabeth reappear in his life is absolutely worth a thousand words!  It's unforgettable.  There's very little dialogue in this movie; indeed it's not missed.  In fact this film has been prepared so concisely that a lot of the details are left to the fantasy of the viewer.  It's as though the director is saying, ""I won't bore you with these minute details.  Fill them out for yourself.""  And you will.  The love scenes are memorable, proving that it's the intensity of feeling between the partners rather than superior technique in love-making that counts for more.  But this story is predominantly about the love between parent and child, that most moving and touching love.  The actress who plays the little girl is perfect.

1003972,5,6305268843,"After watching scores of terrible films, I was beginning to believe that there is little hope for the film industry.  This film, however, is truly brilliant.  Even the most hard-core critic will have a difficult time deconstructing this masterpiece.  As for the acting, Sophie Marceau and Stephan Dillane give stirring performances.  Dillane is such a great actor.  After seeing his performance in ""Welcome to Sarajevo,"" I knew that ""Firelight"" would have a high calibre of acting.  This film will go on my movie shelf as a ""keeper.""  Moreover, the premise of the story is very interesting.  Set in the early to mid nineteenth century, Charles (Dillane) engages Elizabeth (Marceau) in what he considers to be a purely ""business"" transaction.  Because his wife is invalid, he proposes to spend three nights with Elizabeth in order to impregnate her so that he might have an heir.  However, Elizabeth cannot keep her part of the bargain.  Even though ""Miss Louisa"" was conceived during the time of firelight, she cannot forget the daughter she gave birth to.  After seven years of searching, she finally finds her daughter and manages to obtain employment in Charles' household.  This film is so touching because it explores the bond between mother and child.  Just as Elizabeth yearned for her ""English daughter,"" her daughter yearned for her mother - a gap, which no father can fill, no matter how much love is given.  Finally, in addition to a wonderful script, superb acting and great cinematography, there is a happy ending.",980121600,19,1527,5.027888446215139

The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous; oh, I so want to live wherever it is they filmed this movie. The performances are so very subtle, yet each action & word speak to the viewer. William Nicholson did a splendid job drawing every nuance from his actors - Louisa Louisa Louisa, why haven't you done more movies my child? I honestly didn't know who William N. was until watching this lovely piece of art, so I started looking thus finding out he had been instrumental in many of my top favorites - Gladiator anyone?

7886496,4,6305268843,"I am ashamed to admit it, but I only know Sophie Marceau from a Bond film in the 1990s & Stephen Dillane from Game of Thrones & the English version of The Tunnel.  Both are here, used to great effect.

I won't rehash the story, which is rather unique.  But if you want some atmospheric romance this is good.

Mr. Dillane's acting bests Ms. Marceau's here, to me, because he is given such a range.  He is sad, stiff, happy, lustful, angry, & he handles it all well. You feel his character's deep sense of obligation, to his wife, his father's debts, his family.  He is happy with his daughter & with the governness.

Sophie's character is mostly just quiet & a bit lacking in emotion. I know that her character is supposed to be stoic & resolved to a plan of action, based on circumstances thrust on her.  The scenes with the little girl (the daughter)  & about helping her leap off the screen.  She is most believable as a mother.

Speaking of which, the movie makes fine points about the roles of women & of raising a child, adding extra depth to the picture.  This movie also illustrates the lives of children with irresponsible parents, & how often they must take on extra or unwanted roles.

The issue of whether or not someone should remain eternally loyal, and therefore celibate & lonely, to a spouse in a vegetative state is addressed in the story.  As you can see from the reviews it is not handled in a universally admired way.  I can say as a woman married 18 years that I would hope my husband does what Charles does, if I were in that condition, but much sooner, pre-baby & governness! ( This is why I intend, as does he, to leave legal documentation of my wishes.  If the woman could understand anything at all, I would say it was wrong, but to sit in the bed all day & night, saying nothing, hearing nothing....this  is not life to me.)

Yes, there are holes in the story, like her managing to find a wealthier man in another country with her child, but still worth a view for all the performances.",1507593600,,2013,4.365591397849462
