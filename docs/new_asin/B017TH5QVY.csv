8740631,5,B017TH5QVY,"In this new Buti Yoga dvd, she goes a little above my head in what I can do in yoga. I do want I can. I still like it though.",1452902400,3,125,3.2
8740632,5,B017TH5QVY,"Once again, Bizzie has come up with some wonderful Buti workouts.  I don't know how she does it, but she always manages to come up with new moves and new flows so no two of her workouts feel the same.

This Series has the following workouts:

* 30 minute Soul Rise
* 60 minute Soul Rise
* 30 minute Soul Set
* 45 minute Soul Set.

As the workout names imply, the first two workouts are energizing ones and perfect ones to start your day.  The Soul Set workouts are relaxing and wonderful to do at the end of a long day.  I always sleep much better after doing one of the Soul Set workouts.

With these workouts, it is just Bizzie working out  in a brick walled set.  There are some minimalist props as well:  a bench and a sunflower in a pot.

Why I love these workouts:

* I always feel so great after finishing them.  Even if I was tired and cranky to begin with, I far from that when Im done working out.

* The flows make me feel so graceful. Okay, I probably don't look very graceful, but its how I feel inside that counts, right?

* The cool music.  I feel relaxed just listening to the songs.

If you are looking for some fun, new ways to do yoga, you will enjoy this series.

I bought this set directly from the Buti Yoga sight when they first came out.",1449100800,11,1261,4.077551020408163
