He spends a majority of the time ""showing off"" and to me anyone who uses a disclavier (sp) to assist them with their playing already gets a down mark from me.  He does cover some of the various scales and modes well; however, like most Homespun DVDs they really don't teach concepts but songs mainly in one key which does not help you much if someone calls out Cherokee in C, D, E,F, G etc.  Overall decent tape but there are better out there now.",1511308800,,605,4.243478260869566
8183832,5,B000O78C4K,"Andy LaVerne is an amazing player and teacher.  There are many Dvd's out there with great players who just show off and play through things quickly.  In this Dvd, Andy presents concepts that will really improve your playing.  He breaks each concept down, demonstrates at both full tempo and slower speeds and provides a small music booklet as a visual aid.  Dont get me wrong, it will still take work to master these concepts, but you will be able to understand what you are trying to master and set clear practice goals for yourself.",1394755200,4,534,4.648936170212766
