So far, I have only encountered one that I had a hard time listening to.  Some shows are softer then others so I just watch the volume when a show ends and another begins.  I haven't listened to all the files on the DVD yet, there 410, overall I am happy with the ones that I have listened to.

About the DVD itself.  It only plays on the computer, it will not work in a DVD player.  You can't make music cds from these files unless you convert their format.  I didn't buy this to make cds so I haven't tried to convert them.  Most of the shows on this DVD are .mp3 files but there is a good chunk (over 30) that are .wma.  I wanted to point that out because my mp3 player didn't support that format.  The files are really small, around 3.77 MB, I was able to fit over 200 shows on my 1 GB mp3 player.",1223424000,7,963,3.9635416666666665
