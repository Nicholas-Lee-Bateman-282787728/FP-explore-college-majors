7927078,4,B00004YA1C,"When I was a boy, I was fascinated by the ancient Greek goddess Athena, and the modern Athena, Miss Massey, is attractive too. This movie I found at ""amazon.com"" is an action one, as you may tell by the box. It holds my attention well with the action and sexy scenes with Miss Massey. I've seen her name listed in movies, but this is the first time I actually saw her. I plan to find more of her movies, since she is attractive and in probably in some entertaining movies. My father had a good friend named Homer Massey, and my brother and I liked some of his kids.",1316044800,,565,4.192660550458716
7927079,4,B00004YA1C,"First off, don't bother buying or renting this one if you don't like B-movies. The plot centers around a terrorist who threatens to release deadly nerve gas, and a ""covert squad"" sent to stop him. This movie is typical low budget fare, but with plenty of action and some hysterical, ""although some may have been unintentional"" lines this should delight most viewers. For the Athena Massey fans out there, Director Fred Gallo makes sure you see all of her, and thats a good thing, cause Steve Railsback isn't quite as good looking. The DVD has some nice bios especially of executive producer Roger Corman, who should be refered to as the God, King and Master of the low budget flick",975888000,9,681,4.683333333333334
