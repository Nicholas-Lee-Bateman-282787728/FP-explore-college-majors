7826342,2,6302462665,"This review is for the Cabin Fever colorized VHS edition of ""Below Zero"" (I have to make that clear because sometimes Amazon mixes together reviews of different editions of the same movies.)

I love Laurel & Hardy, but this is not one of their better films. It was made immediately after ""Brats"" and immediately before ""Hog Wild"", and both of those films are top-notch Laurel & Hardy.

Even lesser L&H films always have some laughs, and ""Below Zero"" is no exception. However, I would strongly advise you to obtain some other edition of this film, as the Cabin Fever edition is missing three minutes of footage. (The complete film runs 20 minutes. The edited edition runs only 17 minutes, although the back of the box says ""approximately 25 minutes"".)

The complete film was included on the Video Treasures release of The Bohemian Girl, Volume 7 of the ""Laurel and Hardy Comedy Classics"" series released by the Nostalgia Merchant in the 1980's, and also on Volume 7 of ""Laurel & Hardy Classic Shorts"", a 10-volume series of DVD-Rs put out by a small company. Unlike the Cabin Fever edition, these three other versions are in black and white, and are unedited.",1285459200,2,1158,4.78

a local cop. Grateful, they offer to buy the cop lunch, only to discover the wallet belongs to the cop. The boys just never seem
to get a break.",1262995200,,270,3.8392857142857144
