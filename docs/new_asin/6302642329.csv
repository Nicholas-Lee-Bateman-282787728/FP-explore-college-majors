7828513,5,6302642329,"Oh my gosh, this brings back such great memories!!  This series was undoubtedly one of the best in the 90's era. Our daughter, who's 25 now, used to sit and watch this show for hours. This was definitely the VHS of choice when it was time for family time. The characters, The Mad Hatter, Rabbit, The Queen of Hearts, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb and all of the other actors delivered excellent performances. It was like a magical experience which left you feeling like you were a part of the show! Those were some fond memories. If you're looking for some good wholesome entertainment, don't pass this up!!",1418342400,2,606,4.611111111111111

7828516,5,6302642329,I loved this show as a child and my daughter does now too. It is a live action story of Alice in Wonderland. Each episode is equally entertaining and there is just something about the live people that I loved as a kid and my kids now love too. It is fun and almost magical.,1324512000,2,273,3.981818181818182

7828518,5,6302642329,"My oldest son loved this show when he was little!  Now his younger siblings and step-siblings love it too!  Each episode features certain moral characteristics and behaviors that we(as parents) want to instill in our children.  They learn these through music and situational comedy meant for young children.  The shows are excellent, and I wish that Disney would release the entire series.  If you have children, they will love it!",1239840000,8,431,5.1

My order was expedited quickly and received it sooner then expected.  The quality of product is excellent.  I'm glad someone had the video - it was hard to find.  My daughter just loves watching it.
