4984886,5,B006ESH2CQ,"Richard Thompson is one of the most commercially under-appreciated artists of out time. A virtuoso guitarist, Thompson adds song writing and vocal skills to the mix. With a band that is incredibly tight and proficient, this live set offers a very compelling concert experience. With a soundtrack offering DTS Master sound, it is a must buy for Thompson fans, highly recommended for fans of folk, or Americana, and one of the best live concert discs I have seen.",1354147200,2,461,4.923076923076923
4984887,5,B006ESH2CQ,"How can this guy have so much coming out of him like a never ending creativity ,high quality music though i long for the days of simon,sandy and early richard thompson big band and good ol linda. This record is another path he found and recorded live -well look at the talent with him joel,pete and michael and fab bass player. This record is too sexy for its shirt.",1348531200,,366,4.318840579710145
4984888,5,B006ESH2CQ,"Richard is an unbelievable talent.  His lyrics are intriguing, how he structures his songs for a band is a treat to watch, and his solos will take your breath away.  I can't wait to see him in person some day soon.",1338249600,,214,4.195121951219512
4984889,5,B006ESH2CQ,"This is basically the same show I saw (although in a different venue/city) over a year ago and it was great to revisit it and see Richard and the band at their best.  I watched this on a 12 ft. wide screen in a $200K home theater system and can attest to it's excellent video and audio quality! If you have a screen larger than 40 or 50"" definitely get the Bluray version!
Mr. Thompson is still at the top of his game here, with some terrific new material (although probably going on 2 years old by now) and a great backing band. His skill and sensitivity on guitar are second to none, and his songwriting skills are also top notch-- a rare combination!
His backing band is also terrific and is allowed significant time during the show to show off their skills as well.
Overall, if you're a RT fan, this video will not disappoint!  My only (minor) complaint is if I were the video editor, I would have lingered more on Richard and the other performers more during their solos, rather than feel the need to cut away to a different ""shot"" every 10 - 15 seconds or so.  If someone (especially RT) is doing a killer solo, stay with that for a while until it wraps up, then cut to another shot!  Perhaps a minor complaint, but if Richard is soloing, I want to watch him, NOT the drummer for Pete's sake!
Overall, a five star performance and a 4 star video disc.",1337558400,9,1356,4.28515625
4984890,4,B006ESH2CQ,My only disappointment was some tunes I would like to have included... very good reason to release another one Richard!,1336953600,,119,5.0
4984891,5,B006ESH2CQ,"RT is not for everyone!  This is a great RT offering.  I think ""Dream Attic"" is one of his best, some reviewers disagree but I put it with ""Rumor and Sigh"" or ""Shoot out the Lights"" or many other outstanding projects.  The band is great: they've been together long enough to really get it, the sound is superb, the photography is not perfect but close enough.  RT is MY favorite singer/songwriter from the UK and has been since Fairport  Convention and this DVD is probably the best of his DVDs.  If you're an RT fan but don't have one of his DVDs and wondering which to buy, this is it!  His catalogue of music is huge and this is just a small offering but will give you a perspective of what he is about!  Great DVD!",1332460800,2,718,4.227941176470588
4984892,5,B006ESH2CQ,"I realize RT fans are traditionally rabid, but with good reason. He proves once again that he's one of the greatest guitarists ever, and he doesn't have near enough concert movies. I watched this the first night it arrived and then watched it again the next night.",1328918400,2,264,4.638297872340425
4984893,5,B006ESH2CQ,"I must note, at the start, that Dream Attic-- RT's 2010 CD that comprises the first half of this DVD's concert-- is not among my favorites in the RT catalogue. With the exception of the instant classic ""If Love Whispers Your Name,"" the rest of Dream Attic is merely good by RT standards and not as consistently outstanding, in my judgment, as 2007's Sweet Warrior for example. That said, this is a fabulous concert DVD. The performance is impeccable, the video (I have the blu-ray version) is crisp, and the audio quality is clear and detailed. Pop this into a blu ray player hooked up to a big screen HDTV and a decent AV system and it is almost like you are attending the concert live. Aside from the Dream Attic material, the concert includes a number of RT concert staples along with some unexpected surprises. Chief among the latter is a joyous version of ""The Angels Took My Race Horse Away"" that will give you a new appreciation for the almost 40 year old song. If you are a Richard Thompson fan, you won't regret the purchase which at half the cost of a concert ticket is a great bargain. If you have not yet discovered RT, but have an appreciation for intelligent roots-based rock with a unique, Celtic twist, this DVD will be a revelation.",1328486400,12,1249,4.506607929515418
4984894,5,B006ESH2CQ,"Wow, Richard Thompson, what a master (musician, song-smith, performer)!

This show from January 25th, 2011, recorded in Scotland after almost a year of steady touring that began in February 2010 (recorded as the album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dream-Attic/dp/B003NYVYB4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dream Attic</a>), consisting of two parts, new songs (played here in the same order as the album) and a selection of old favorites, is pretty much the same as what I heard at the start of the tour in Seattle, except that 2 songs from that earlier recording are missing (""Crimescene"" and ""Bad Again""). Although I can't remember the exact set list from the excellent, more stretched out second half, it sounds similar. The band is the same (really good, with Taras Prodaniuk on bass, and Joe Zifkin on violin and mandolin, joining RT's old reliable multi-instrumentalist Pete Zorn and drummer Michael Jerome), and  the songs are clearly well known by this point, so what we get to hear probably makes RT really happy. It makes the fans happy too.

For any Richard Thompson fan this is a must have DVD (since the killer second set isn't part of Dream Attic, and their performance of ""Can't Win"" is worth the price of admission alone). Film (high def, sharp and clear) and sound quality is top notch, and the performance seems to be a special one as well. I admit, seeing them here on DVD is even better than it was live.

As a bonus we get two solo acoustic performances, one of my favorites - ""Uninhabited Man"", and the other the appropriately Celtic, ""Johnny's Far Away"", to a large enthusiastic crowd at the Cambridge Folk Festival - 1/19/11. Great stuff.",1328227200,27,1701,5.1521739130434785
4984895,5,B006ESH2CQ,"This is Richard Thompson with a larger band  -violin, saxophone / flute , and  a solid rhythm section . It is a terrific sounding , and wonderfully shot dvd ! Richard Thompson  -and band - are in fine form , and the set list of new & old songs is just right . I've seen RT many times  , starting with the ' Shoot Out the Lights' tour  , and this is the one of the best shows I've ever heard of his . Having the extra instruments really fills out the songs , and makes me eager to catch this group  live .  A ' 5 STAR ' performance !!!",1327968000,11,534,3.7567567567567566

4984897,5,B006ESH2CQ,"""Live at Celtic Connections"" is everything we have come to expect from Richard Thompson: instrumental virtuosity, intelligent lyrics and wicked humor in between songs.  The band is superb: it's always good to once again see long-time Thompson collaborator and multi-instrumentalist Pete Zorn, and Michael Jerome (drums) and Taras Prodaniuk (bass) form a solid, dynamic rhythm section.  The wonderful bonus is the addition of virtuoso violinist Joel Zifkin to Thompson's musical arsenal.  Both audio and video quality are top-notch on this Blue-Ray, so the only downer is the crowd! Did these people have their butts super-glued to their seats? Were they cautioned before the show began, ""Behave yourselves""? I know UK residents tend to be a bit on the ""reserved"" side but this is ridiculous! Our man RT and his mates are up there rockin' their socks off but when the vid cuts to crowd scenes it looks like folks are preoccupied with figuring out which bus to take home after the show.  Too bad, Richard...you deserved better!",1401840000,2,1025,5.119760479041916
4984898,5,B006ESH2CQ,"The quality of the picture and sound is amazing, but even more stunning is Richard Thompson's ceaseless talent. Just about every other musical artist I've admired over the years has lost their exceptional songwriting ability as they've aged, but not Richard Thompson.",1394928000,2,267,5.380952380952381

4984901,5,B006ESH2CQ,"This is a fabulous concert for all those Thompson fans pining for his electric work. A stand out is ""You can't win"", it's unbelievable that an incredible artist like that has been able to stay under the radar of real commercial success. For all hobby guitarists: don't try this at home, his playing is complicated and sophisticated, buy the DVD instead and prepare to be awed!",1372982400,2,376,4.712121212121212

4984903,5,B006ESH2CQ,"The attendees seem to all be sedated. Even Richard's sense of humorous doesn't seem to reach them.  It almost painful to watch at times! BUT, Richard is fabulous as always. Nicely shot BluRay.",1364256000,4,192,4.818181818181818

8496902,3,B006ESH2CQ,"I'm a big Richard Thompson fan. He writes some quirky, really interesting songs like ""Beeswing"" and ""Black Vincent 1952"" that I especially enjoy. Sorry to say I found this concert boring. Good sound and film.",1527120000,,208,4.9714285714285715
8496903,3,B006ESH2CQ,The thing is he first goes we're going to play our new album then a greatest hits (I kind of think not greatest hits but stuff off older albums in general) and he does play most of his new album (two songs missing) but holding your audience hostage and at the beginning he comments that's what he's doing.... .  decent sound (I think it's shrill) decent video WTF song list...  I wrote this because of his attitude toward the crowd and the view at home... me and you.  Over half the time to the new album of a 148 min concert.  Thank you mr thompson. not essential,1523232000,,564,4.242990654205608
8496904,3,B006ESH2CQ,Who ever produced this Blu Ray messed up on the audio mixing. Richards voice is too low in relation to the music. I love RT but this Blu Ray is disappointing. This is not a Richard Thompson issue it's a mixing issue.,1458604800,,216,4.166666666666667
8496905,4,B006ESH2CQ,.R.T. is a treasured musician but I'm not a big fan of Celtic music.  It was worth sampling though.,1454025600,,99,4.2105263157894735
8496906,4,B006ESH2CQ,"It took me a couple times watching this concert DVD to enjoy it. Seems the room was a bit big and the audience perhaps too stiff or too far away from RT for him to engage spontaneously with which is a great part of any of his concerts. But the second time through I noticed more interplay with the audience even though some of it is lost in the audio. Band is superb through material from the live-in-the-studio Dream Attic album (first half of the concert) and then with more familiar material (second half). Some intimacy is lost in the large hall which also seems to ""formalize"" the music somewhat robbing some of the tongue-in-cheek humor from a few songs. Overall though a stellar performance with some intense extended solos.",1445644800,2,731,4.630769230769231
