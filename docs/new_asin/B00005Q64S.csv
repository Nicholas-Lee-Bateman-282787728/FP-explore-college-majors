7949870,1,B00005Q64S,"OK, so it was a 6 or 7 bucks, and I wasn't expecting *great* things out of it, but I did expect to glean a tip or two about improving my skeet game. Instead, this was basically a way for 2 guys to get their names out there in the public eye as instructors. The entire movie was these two guys being interviewed in the background while video plays of an instructor and a kid shooting a round of skeet. No instruction, no real introduction to the sport. It's paying $ to see someone else shoot a round with no idea how they're doing, how they can improve, or how you can apply anything that you're seeing. Weak.",1062806400,49,609,4.169491525423729
