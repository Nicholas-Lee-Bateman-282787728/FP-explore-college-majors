5459307,4,B00ANDEL4U,"Great selection of movies. If it was me, perhaps all the movies would be Wes Craven & all 80's & 90's; however, what we have here is definitely not bad.",1476144000,,152,4.1

5459311,1,B00ANDEL4U,"This would be false advertising, correct?  Training Day and AHX are alright, Edge of Darkness is atrocious, and Goodfellas is a beloved classic that is probably the main selling point of this set (it was for me at least), so why would you only include half of it? It is just so strange to me that something that is sold in such major retailers as Walmart with such a huge error, and it STILL has not been fixed.

Therefore, unless you hate the second half of Goodfellas (for some reason), do not waste your money.",1462579200,2,513,4.389473684210526

5459322,4,B00ANDEL4U,"No real ""must see"" films here, but most you may have missed.  Nice set of escapism thrillers that you don't see around much and while they are primarily three star films they are entertaining and having 4  films together that you may not have seen is a plus.  Even the early Wes Craven off kilter horror flick while not as good as the others was entertaining.  Worth a watch.",1422489600,4,375,4.391304347826087

8554645,4,B00ANDEL4U,"I just received this set Today, the 4 Film Favorites: Crime Dramas set. I read reviews here on Amazon that the movie GoodFellas is missing the second half... I can confirm that. For some reason, the set only comes with Side A... at least mine did, anyway. But for the price I paid, it's worth it just for the other 3 movies. If GoodFellas is your main selling point for this set, then I would stray away from this set. I'm unsure if any other sets have this problem, so I cannot recommend another movie set to get GoodFellas in, if you wanna get it on a set. If you're buying this set just to get crime dramas, then get it at a good deal if possible. This set also has a 90 years WB slipcover which is gold colored, but not every set has this slipcover. In terms of special features, there's not a lot, except for Training Day. I think it was pretty much just trailers and extended/deleted scenes, but GoodFellas has none listed. All of the movies are on their own disc stacked together. Not the biggest fan of this case style, but it could be a lot worse... Double sided discs. The enemy of a collector. Regardless, I look forward to checking out what is on here soon... Kinda can't watch GoodFellas in full, but the other 3, yeah. This should be good.",1530489600,,1253,4.291139240506329
