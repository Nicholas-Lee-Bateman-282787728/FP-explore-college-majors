8535992,1,B0094KUAO8,"This is a 1984 documentary, with poor quality; the story of Findhorn needs an immense reboot to show it today, alongside some of this footage. As it starts, it never really explains what they're doing, and it's mostly blurry anyways. Description needs to be updated to show that this is a VHS from 1984, updated to DVD.",1489104000,2,319,4.614035087719298
8535993,4,B0094KUAO8,"This film provides a good introduction to the Findhorn community, and provides insight into both the accomplishments and struggles that the group faced as they grew into a larger organization.

The film makers also did an excellent job of providing an egalitarian view of the individuals involved in the Findhorn project, and gave equal face time to group members regardless of their status as celebrities in the wider culture.",1376006400,3,427,5.188405797101449
8535994,5,B0094KUAO8,"This film delves into the place, the founders and the people that made it so magical. A must see for any individual that is interested in permaculture or sustainable living.",1346889600,3,173,4.8
