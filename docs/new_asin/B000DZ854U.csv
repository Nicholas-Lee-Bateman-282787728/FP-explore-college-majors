2475737,3,B000DZ854U,"The ""Real Ghostbusters"" DVD releases have been controversial among longtime fans of the show because they are not season boxed sets and contain only one or two of what are considered the best episodes of the series.  Some fans have theorized that the best way to increase the likelihood of boxed set releases is to purchase the DVDs that are already out.  What of the episodes themselves?

""The Real Ghostbusters -- Spooky Spirits""' weakest episode is its first, ""Ghostbuster of the Year"", which attempts to curry favor with intelligent children with its ""clever"" references to classic movies.  Unfortunately, ""Citizen Kane"" was already one of the most referenced and parodied films of all time in 1986, and the ghost in this episode says ""Rosebud"" often enough that I wanted to strangle him if he said it one more time.  The script also manages to make all the Ghostbusters except Winston unlikeable -- which doesn't really do Winston any favors.  On the other hand, the final fate of the ghost is rather sweet, and the episode ends with a deliciously obscure ""Ghostbusters"" in-joke.

""The Revenge of Murray the Mantis"" is substantially better, despite its rather low animation quality -- a problem with the majority of ""Real Ghostbusters"" episodes.  The very nice scene where the Ghostbusters discuss the Murray the Mantis TV show is presumably intended as a self-referential acknowledgement of the series' adult viewers, but manages not to hit the viewer over the head with its cleverness.  The reappearance of a certain character from the original movie has been criticized online as illogical and unexplained, but is very, very funny -- surely a sufficient justification.

""Drool, the Dog-Faced Goblin"" was scripted by Linda Woolverton, who went on to much greater fame as one of the writers of Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King"".  Unfortunately, for all you Shakespeareans out there, ""Drool, the Dog-Faced Goblin"" is to those two classic movies what ""The Phoenix and the Turtle"" is to ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Hamlet"".  Despite some good lines and touches of characterization, the episode feels weakly constructed and rather pointless.  The ending is oddly dark for Saturday morning television, and yet does not seem especially meaningful or artistically necessary -- one has the feeling that Woolverton simply couldn't think of any other way to resolve the story.

""Mr. Sandman, Dream Me a Dream"" was written by J. Michael Straczynski, the story editor of the series and the future creator of ""Babylon 5"".  It is probably the best of the four episodes -- certainly it is the most elaborate and rich, perhaps too rich for its own good.  The episode is weakened by the villain's absurdly pretentious motivation, which feels especially whinily liberal given the relative stability of the times in which it was written.  Winston's big speech to the villain is too sappily ""Saturday-morning"", and the climactic twist doesn't have the impact it should, perhaps again due to the quality of the animation.  This is, nonetheless, a worthwhile episode.

Overall this DVD should be enjoyed by fans of the series, but inevitably fails to recapture the magic of the original ""Ghostbusters"" movie.",1155513600,4,3206,5.10727969348659
2475738,4,B000DZ854U,"Sony just released these three discs to see if people would actually buy them, and i must say that this is great! i bought all three and am just waiting for the boxed sets to be released. Although there are no extras at all or subtitles (i love subtitles)i'd still recommend them and the boxed sets (if they come out anytime soon).",1154995200,2,331,4.354838709677419
2475739,4,B000DZ854U,"Hardcore fans of the series will not be disappointed with this compilation, even though it is not the full boxed set that we have been begging for since 1992. The title of the compilation seems more worthy of a Scooby-Doo disc set, but don't let the title keep you from purchasing the disc.  Each disc's episodes were selected around a theme, in this case, ""spirits.""  The episodes appear the way they originally aired and do not appear to have been edited or cut.  The images appear to have been retouched; the colors are somewhat more vibrant, but still keep the muted tones that marked the show.  Although the characters' appearances on the front cover have ben updated, the artwork inside and on the disc remains the same.

My only complaint was the lack of special features and the lack of a foreign language track.

Younger children who did not grow up with the series may be somewhat frightened by the images and themes in some episodes.",1143504000,3,944,4.656626506024097
2475740,3,B000DZ854U,"Ok,I know that buying this the studio will see if customers are interested in the show but Sony should make an effort and release complete seasons sets. Fans will buy more sets even if prize is higher. This Dvd has many flaws. No commentary or special features. Image quality is bad in some episodes. But has CC and I have bought similar Dvds with 2,3 o 4 eps that hasn't any(cheap transfer and unknown studios)that hasn't any and had a higher prize.",1142121600,10,450,4.5
2475741,5,B000DZ854U,I don't understand the fuss about only being  4 episodes this is how it was released on vhs. It did not seem to bother anyone then. Anyhow I am just glad to get them on dvd. They could of picked better episodes like Boodunnit and When Halloween was forever.,1140998400,2,257,4.244897959183674
2475742,3,B000DZ854U,"These DVD releases of The Real Ghostbusters were a long time coming. This was one of the few Saturday morning cartoons that had some continuity and smarts to it as well as the blending of supernatural and science fiction in a way fun for both kids and some adults. The reason I'm not too thrilled is because this is just four episodes from the series, and they aren't even in any particular order. They try and set this DVD with a theme and pick out episodes close to that theme, but in my opinion they should have just put an entire season into one complete set. Good episodes are being missed here. The episodes on this DVD, according to my sources, are as follows (all eps are from season 1):

Revenge of Murray the Mantis - Spirits take over a balloon (of a preying mantis) in the Thanksgiving Day parade and the boys have to release Stay-Puft to battle the bug.

Ghostbuster of the Year -  Self explanatory. The boys compete for man of the year.

Drool the Dogfaced Goblin - The boys find a goblin at a circus as well as an unamalgamated shape shifter

Mr Sandman Dream Me a Dream - The Sandman attacks New York and Winston is the only one awake to stop him.

I've heard nothing about extra features and considering the starting price on these DVDs I wouldn't expect any. We'll be lucky if they cleaned up the video and audio. I just hope they decide to add other collections that include other good episodes (season one had over 70 eps in all). Still these are good ones and most of them are written by the guy who created Babylon 5. If you remember the T.V. show and think the price is right on this collection, by all means go for it.",1135641600,19,1642,4.314935064935065

8102881,4,B000DZ854U,"The Real Ghostbusters(1986) was a cool cartoon. It did justice to the 1984 blockbuster and it added more color and texture to the Ghostbusters world. The producers hired voice actors who sounded like Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson. The show was driven by an electronica music score. The show could not afford a larger than life music score that Elmer Bernstein crafted for the film. The green, obese ghost in Ghostbusters was nicknamed ""Onion Head"". In the TV show, his name has been changed to ""Slimer"". The Real Ghostbusters mixes supernatural horror with comedy. The cartoon Peter Venkman was given a ""pretty boy look"". Egon's hair has been changed from black to blonde. The Ghostbuster uniforms have individual colors. In the movie, Ray, Peter, Egon, and Winston wear the same grey jumpsuit. This cartoon leaves out Dana and Louis. Mr. Stay Puft makes a guest appearance in one episode as a good guy. The Ghostbusters in the cartoon have a gyrocopter. In the show, they fight a Charles Foster Kane ghost, bigfoot, the Boogieman, a giant bird that spews fire, and more. The Real Ghostbusters is one of the best cartoons from the 1980's.",1360281600,2,1165,4.888888888888889

8102883,4,B000DZ854U,"Well, going back to the 80's, and that's what you get with this DVD. I was hesitating when deciding to buy one of the The Real Ghostbusters dvds but Stay Puff, the marshmallow man made me decide which one. Fortunately there were some episodes that I never saw when they were on TV, 'cause they were transmited in pairs and almost at the same hour when I came out of elementary school, so I used to arrive on time to see the second episode, therefore I found them quite amusing. I think that the only con of this dvds (And that is why I score it as four stars only when it really deserves five stars) is that the episodes are spared, they are not presented in a timely sequence, and of course not all the episodes are available, I do not know how many episodes were made though. Please I want the complete seasons! That'll be great!",1221696000,,831,4.265822784810126
8102884,3,B000DZ854U,"It's exceedingly difficult for 80s cartoons to hold up once Father Time gets ahold of them (Garfield & Friends and Batman: TAS are among the best of the lot), and The Real Ghostbusters does well enough to justify a purchase of a few non-season DVDs. The price is right and it's convenient that you can grab a few episodes on DVD without having to plunk down over $100 for the upcoming full series set.

Take a stroll down memory lane with Spooky Spirits or one of the other Ghostbuster releases, but the trip is short.",1219881600,,518,4.4526315789473685
