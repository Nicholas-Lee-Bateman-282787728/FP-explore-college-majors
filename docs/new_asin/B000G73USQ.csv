8129354,2,B000G73USQ,"""Infinite Ryvius"" boasts a most excellent concept for a show.  ""Lord of the Flies"" in space.  So what happened?

THE GOOD:
The animation is older, but good.  Full character motions are animated all the way.  There are no gimmicks, CG crutches, or regurgitated still frames.  Fans of the newer, glossier animes might be turned off by the dated look of it, so be warned (it looks old).

The premise is fantastic.  The universe that's created for the show is intelligently detailed and unfolds slowly, keeping your attention and injecting mystery.  The first half of the show seems to crawl, but the second half picks up speed and the pacing finally delivers entertainment and intrigue.

THE BAD:
The dialogue is painfully dim.  They are ALL youths, so immaturity is expected, but the conversations and character declarations don't seem realistic.  A life or death crisis is occurring on the space ship, yet the cast seems preoccupied with the person standing next to them and whether or not they like them.  The compelling story that is there is vocalized to you by constant whining, nervous first kisses, to-cool-for-school rebels scoffing at every little thing, and a very poor English dub that makes every character sound like high school drama club candidates.  I think kids are smarter than this and more serious when it comes to emergency situations.  As far as depth, ""Lord of the Flies"" ripped open the childrens egos and dove in to their core natures.  This show scrapes softly with a scalpel.

The music is mixture of J Pop and Hip Hop.  It doesn't fit with the seriousness the show means to hold.  It sucks gravity from every scene.

All in all, this is an overlooked show.  Although it takes awhile to discover, there is a good story here and a smart universe.  If you're not bothered by a jarring, headshaking soundtrack, nonstop angst, and unrealistic dialogue, then I would invite you to enjoy the ride.  This could have been one of the best animes, it just wasn't executed well.  They should have used ""Lord of the Flies"" as a guide instead of just a template.

8129355,5,B000G73USQ,"In the year 2225 AD, Kouji Aiba and his childhood friend Aoi Housen are astronauts in-training aboard the Liebe Delta, a space station at the edge of the Geduld Sea. But during a routine dive procedure, disaster strikes and the station begins to fall into the Geduld, a strange field with intense pressure that could crush the station like a bug if it falls to deep. To complicate matters further, the events that led to the stations decent also took the lives of every adult onboard, leaving 500 teenagers to fend for themselves in the depths of space.

I wasn't sure what to expect from this series. I had heard that it was 'Lord of the Flies in Space', but never having read Lord of the Flies, I didn't really get what I was in for. But then I started watching it and found myself sucked in from the very first episode. The series moves on at a very fast pace and it was hard for me to find a stopping spot. The action was interesting, the cast of characters widely varied, and the plot gripping. The social and moral issues in the story were really interesting and not easily answered. Who should take charge when the entire chain of command is lost? How can people live together when society has broken down? What should you do when chaos begins to take hold? The dilemmas the characters face very different then those found in most anime.

I think that one of the most interesting things about this show was the main character. He is just your average teenager - not the smartest, not the dumbest, has some family problems, mellow personality. And when disaster happens... he doesn't really change. He doesn't magically become the leader the kids sorely need, he doesn't become the amazing mecha pilot, he doesn't develop psychic powers, or a rapport with some alien species. He has to work his way through the situation same as everyone else. Sometimes he has good ideas, sometimes he makes good decisions. And sometimes he doesn't. Slowly, over the course of the series, he starts to realize what sort of person he is and begins to work on correcting his flaws.

If you enjoy Science Fiction, complex plots, and situations where characters face difficult decisions, then Infinite Ryvius is the show for you. If all you want is space fighting, try Gundam or Heroic Age.

Note on this DVD set: There are some weird spots in the show where the art and/or picture quality drops horribly. Since another review mentioned this same problem with their set, I think this is probably problem with the show and not the DVDs. It is a little bit of an older show (1999-2000).",1332720000,2,2808,4.880503144654088
8129356,5,B000G73USQ,"It would be easy to say that Infinite Ryvius is ""Lord of the Flies in Space,"" but really it alludes to a whole lot more than that. It combines the ship-of-teenagers put forward by Mobile Suit Gundam, the living mecha and creeping malaise of Neon Genesis Evangelion and, yes, Lord of the Flies, into a fast-moving, emotionally tortuous roller coaster in which the lives of four hundred and eighty six teenagers are on the line. There's also a conspiracy involving the coming apocalypse, the government and the truth behind a solar flare that created an ocean of plasma known as the Geduld, but the execution of those elements are a little half-hearted. What really matters in Ryvius are the students themselves, whose gradual slide into madness form the heart of one of the most remarkably nuanced portraits of society in an anime series.

There is no black and white on board the Ryvius. Everybody breaks eventually, from the main characters to the supporting cast to even the people you think will survive to the end, even those you think will die before the going gets tough. Nobody is spared. Moments of victory are tempered by moments of shame and emotional torment. Not a single person in the show is the same by its end. Everyone is changed, for better or worse.

Infinite Ryvius is spellbinding, unpredictable, frequently breathtaking stuff, directed with a firm hand and populated with people you can't help but care for. The technobabble can occasionally be obnoxious, obscuring facts that would have been obvious had they not been cloaked in nonsensical terminology. Not to mention that the mystery behind the show is convoluted and not quite worth the buildup. But as a portrait of society cracking under enormous strain, it's pretty much unparalleled. An underrated classic.",1326499200,,1786,4.969899665551839
8129357,2,B000G73USQ,"After assaulting my brain with a dozen or so anime series in the last couple years I decided to try and find some stories that don't have a giant robot and maybe make a little more sense of why teenagers are so often in charge of things in these stories.

I like the ""Lord of the Flies"" angle in the synopsis and thought this would be a good departure from the anime norm.

No.

First off, they snuck in a giant robot.  Giant Robots are to anime what refried beans are to Mexican food - they just assume you want some.  Seriously, I got an omlette in Mexico trying to get away from refried beans everywhere and they put a scoop of them next to the omlette with 3 little tortillas sticking up like a refried bean pirate ship.

But I digress.

The show started well enough, the teenagers are stranded on a ship with the adults gone off to save the ship having been killed in the process.  This left the kids free to run the place, find a giant robot and explore what would happen if the kids you went to high school with found themselves in a critical situation.  You know, the quiet type, the manipulative sexed up girl, the structured type, the bully, etc.

Most of the characters were wooden, few likeable.  The graphics were bad, the plot complications unbelievable.  The holes in the plot were big enough to float a 3 masted pirate ship made of refried beans through and detracted from the show.

I finished watching the whole series, convinced through the middle that I was going to give the series one star, but the last 2 episodes dragged it up enough for 2 stars, only because I realized that I was interested enough to see what happened to the remaining characters and I ended up liking the ending, such as it was.

Tighter writing, better action and better graphics would have given it a 3, but alas, it was not meant to be.  Maybe if it was shorter too...

Over all, I would have to recommend a pass on this one.",1244419200,3,1922,4.326815642458101
8129358,5,B000G73USQ,"this is an EXCELLENT series!!!!!!!!! plain and simple. i'm not even gonna bother to inject reasoning into this review. i don't need to, as i'm not giving opinions. it's simply a fact that this series is great!!!

i will give a word of warning though: if you're a kid and still require simple story-lines to get ya going, don't even bother with this one. as it will most likely be above your head (no offense... really, kids ^_^). lots of very realistic characters, put in one dire situation, and left to fend for themselves = brilliant social comentary... this one goes out to all you sociology majors out there!!!! ^_^)",1190505600,7,620,4.636363636363637
8129359,2,B000G73USQ,"Cut out the middle (which is mostly angst) and you have a great series...the ending would have made a decent middle.

The terrorism that destroyed the station was (I thought) well done and the science fiction story believable and interesting; the mysterious girl alone (almost) saved this show from being a complete flop. However, the politics surrounding the event left me mystified - why would they want to destroy a ship that was to save humanity? Why did they change their minds at the end? Why were there no consequences for some people's actions during the series or after (murder, attempted murder, attempted genocide from the Spock wanna be, etc.)??? The only interesting character development was the ""punk"" nurse, though I wish her lover hadn't been such a desperate looser (during the series).

True, they were students - but they were being trained to work in space, right? What idiot did the Psyche evaluations?? Punch a hole in a spaceship? The attacked girl going psychotic? Genocidal Spock? One would think there would be SOME discipline and organization - weren't there any security guards in training?? If they had been forced to pick up their own garbage (how did those army guys take over the ship with all that garbage in the way?), conditions would have been much better for them. How about separating the boys and girls? Hmmmm. There was one girl who had the potential to be a great captain (and save the series) - but she (nauseatingly) never asserted herself and allowed others to make her decisions for her (oh for one of Miyazaki's strong women) - even when elected captain!

For me this series was a big disappointment - if it had been a two hour long movie or half its current length, I would have loved it; but it just goes on too long.",1188345600,3,1766,4.7272727272727275
8129360,4,B000G73USQ,"Like the title suggests, I'm gunna try to write two reviews:

The anime:
Good stuff. If you've done your research, you've probably heard this before, if not, here it is. This anime is lord of the flies in space. It's a bunch of kids who are trapped on a ship and they're trying to sort everything else, and survive. I'm making it sound sorta lame, but I want to stay as far as I can from any spoilers.

The teen crew of this ship face hurdles and with each one comes an added level of stress. It's interesting how everyone reacts to the shift of the kid driven social structures. Totalitarian power, democratic freedom, communistic equality... no matter how the ship is controlled, every system has it's flaws.

For me, this series kept pissing me off... in a good way. The actions of each character seems so irrational, yet, given thier situation and naive views, you can't blame them for thier actions. The series shows how ideals, when take to the extreme, can make a bad situation worse.

In all, the series is pretty gripping. It doesn't require you to think, but if you have an active brain, you'll have plenty of underlying themes to munch on.
BUY IT... but not until you read the next section.

The DVD set:
Any complete anime series is a bargian for something in the 40s-50s range. However, there were a few problems I saw in the animation. I'm not sure if it's the series itself, just this particular DVD set, or just my individual copy of the anime (last one is really unlikely). But on to what those problems are.

Throughout the entire series certian scenes would seem fuzzier than the others. At first I wondered if my projector lense was out of focus, but I knew that wasn't the problem when crisp characters suddenly appeared on screne. The problem is mostly prominent whenever a computer screen is shown. And in this series, there's alot of time spent focused on computer screens.

It's really not THAT big of a deal. I simply saw it as a minor peeve, but it might compromise the enjoyment of the series for others. But then again, I have a pretty high tollerance for technical issues... while some folks have almost no tollerance. However, that's the only complaint I have. There were no noticeble compression artifcacts, or audio problems that I could pick up on.

My suggestion is: Do some research before buying this particular box set. It's a bargan price, but you might also be getting a compromised quality. However, the other DVDs may have similar problems. So like I said, do a bit of research if an occasional [minor] blurring is a major problem for you. Otherwise, it's a great series.

The series gets 5 stars, but this particular DVD set gets 3... So i guess that evens out to a 4 overall. There's my insite, now it's your turn to decide.",1186099200,12,2768,4.564516129032258
