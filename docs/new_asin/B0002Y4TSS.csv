2144871,5,B0002Y4TSS,"Homespun and John Doyle have produced a very helpful guide to Irish rythm guitar. Doyle works in Drop D tuning DADGBE, a good tuning with the advantage of a drone, but with only minor alteration of fingering from standard tuning. Some of the chord shapes are difficult for guitarists with shorter fingers. John Williams plays the melodies very ably on concertina and button accordion at reasonable tempos. I would recommend this DVD highly",1250812800,8,439,5.027397260273973
2144872,5,B0002Y4TSS,"I've seen John Doyle in concert several times and he is absolutely awesome. This DVD is great if you have even a rudimentary ability to play guitar. You'll learn the D tuning that all the Irish guitarists (and lots of American rock n' rollers) use, and a ton of ways to make your chords sound fuller and more interesting if you're into rhythm guitar. If you get a chance to see John Doyle with Liz Carroll, I highly recommend you take advantage of it!",1202083200,13,451,4.380952380952381

8034773,5,B0002Y4TSS,"Love John, love his humour, his style AND he's left handed.  This is from his early days but if you are interested in Irish music, this is the person to learn from.",1411862400,3,164,4.125
8034774,4,B0002Y4TSS,"First off, John Doyle is an amazing guitarist. His signature style of backing traditionals is fantastic and he has a lot of tricks up his sleeve, which he manages to weave in throughout this DVD - think chord substitutions, added/substracted notes, multiple ways of playing the same chord, etc.

I was attracted to this DVD mainly because of his solo albums (post-Solas) and his unique approach to singer-songwriter/traditional-like songs. Since this DVD focuses mostly on accompanying traditional tunes I didn't really learn much about that side of him, but of course I knew this in advance. Even so, this gives a good idea of the basis of his style - the basis where his later signature style is based on.

His instructions aren't always very clear; somehow he skips from subject to subject, doesn't always name the chords he's playing, the order is sometimes strange and he doesn't always play what he announces beforehand - the booklet doesn't always help there, either. But maybe I'm just spoiled.

To get the most out of this DVD will take some work, but in my opinion it's more than worth it. Just waiting for him to launch a DVD discussing his later style...",1391299200,2,1166,4.82
8034775,5,B0002Y4TSS,John Doyle goes through the basics of Celtic tunes comping seasoned with his own signature comping styles. Worth it to enhance your guitar playing skills.,1388448000,,154,5.2
8034776,3,B0002Y4TSS,"John Doyle is a brilliant backup musician, but he tends to ramble on about how it all fits into the genre.  It's worth having just as a model for the kind of sound one hopes to achieve, though the chord changes are hard to follow.  And he's  fun to watch play his great style.",1387756800,,276,4.074074074074074
8034777,5,B0002Y4TSS,"Doyle covers reels, jigs one slipjig and a hornpipe.
Two great aspects:  He talks about 4/4 and 6/8 and then he starts with the strum based on that- no chord, just percussion.  Very beneficial.
The second is the chord substitution approach, which in principle is simple ( like relative minors ) but he applies it so effortlessly.
Both of these help my rhythm and even affect other genres--like bluegrass.

There are a lot of tunes, here.  I didn't know any of them and it takes a while to learn them.  His buddy with the accordian is great and you can just listen to them play.  Once you learn the tunes, it's easier to back it up.

He talks about partial chords and some voicings but overall he discusses the feel of the tunes, where chords fit in and change the mood.

This is worth every penny",1377648000,2,796,4.404109589041096
8034778,5,B0002Y4TSS,"I've been playing guitar since 1974, but just got into playing Irish music earlier this year and currently play in a Celtic band.  John Doyle is a rhythm machine and plays with great joy and feeling.  I really like his playing and wanted to learn some of his technique and approach.  This DVD delivers.  He explains very clearly how he plays and how he thinks about playing.  The camera work shown both hands clearly.  The DVD also comes with a PDF file containing tabulature and notation.

I don't think this is a beginner book.  In fact, John states that he assumes that you know basic chords.  However, I think an intermediate player could get a lot from this.  No matter what, it will take lots of hard work on the players part to master all the material presented here.  But I don't think you need to master everything on the DVD in order to get a lot out of it.  Recommended.",1347321600,6,881,4.403726708074534
8034779,5,B0002Y4TSS,Very enjoyable. I really look forward to more recordings from this artist or any ensemble he is with. Hopefully there will be some DVD offerings at some time.,1336521600,,158,4.678571428571429
8034780,4,B0002Y4TSS,"I am not an accomplished guitarist but someone interested in accompanying Celtic session. This is a great DVD. John covers all the types of Celtic songs and gives you a real feel for them. Each lesson is geared toward bringing you forward in the learning process. However there are a few points that buyers should be aware of.

First, John is a lefty so when you look at his display of how to play the cords you are going to have to translate that into right hand play. I as an amateur found this somewhat difficult to do, especially while playing.

Secondly, the chords, as mentioned in another review are difficult for those who don't have a large hand span. I had difficulty with them.

Thirdly, I bought another book at the same time with DADGAD tuning. Obviously, the fingering is different for all the chords. I did find the chords somewhat easier to play, though less full with DADGAD than with drop D.

All in all, I really enjoyed the DVD and the music. John brings a real ease to teaching others in a progressive manner. His style is the one I would most want to copy for accompanying Celtic music.",1252713600,15,1108,4.47029702970297
