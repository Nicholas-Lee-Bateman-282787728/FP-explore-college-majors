5855537,5,B00DTTRGJW,"Everyone has a dream, be it small or large, practical or impossible. Hard work and determination can often make them reality. John F. Kennedy dreamed of putting a man on the moon and he did. Nelson Mandela dreamed of an end to apartheid in South Africa and it is no more. Richard Teachout and Janel Nash dreamed of scaring the shit out of people and now they do it every fall. Rich and Janel love haunted attractions, or `haunts' as they are called, so much that in 2011 Rich decided to quit his `day job'. The couple threw all their savings into turning a single `haunt' called ""Darkness Falls"" in Louisville, KY into a 42 acre scare fest called ""The Asylum Haunted Attraction"" with four distinct venues and over 80 actors. Filmmakers Brian Cunningham and Joe Laughrey decided they would go along for the ride and document the good, the bad and the scary of Rich and Janel's journey. There was born ""Monsters Wanted"".

The title comes from the ad Rich and Janel placed to start hiring actors and help for the attraction. The film begins with Rich opening a shipping container used to store props and materials used in the ""Darkness Falls"" attraction. The date and the number of days until ""The Asylum"" opens hovers ominously in the corner of the screen as a reminder that the clock is ticking. After the introduction, we get to know Rich and Janel, both through interviews and seeing them in action as they start the process of bringing the haunt to life. Janel is the wonderfully quirky creative mind behind the event. She talks to the camera using a sock-puppet alter ego, and later after she dons her own signature costume personality, a very voodoo/bokor themed outfit that seems to embody her love of the macabre. Rich, while equally enamored with the spirit of horror and Halloween, comes across more business-like. His focus is the mechanics of making the attraction work. Rich and Janel bring the human element to the film and as the viewer learns just how much of the couple's personal livelihood is tied up in the new attraction, one can't help but worry for them as they encounter challenge after challenge. Each major scene opens with the date clock in the corner relentlessly counting down the time to opening day.

Even though Rich and Janel are the driving forces behind the project, it is way too big for just the two of them. They bring together a team of people who are also passionate about the idea of creating the best haunt in the state and they quickly become a family. Of course in every family there are always some problems. From stage manager Kaley Roberts' constant struggles with one of the original attraction's owners to reining in crazy chainsaw wielding actor Paul and his bad habit of causing concussions, there appears to be no end to the challenges facing not just the success, but the very opening of the attraction.

As the time counts down from months to weeks and then to days, the stress shows on the tired but determined faces  Finally it's show time and ""The Asylum Haunted Attraction"" is ready to open to the public on September 9th 2011. The opening isn't as smooth as everyone hoped, but despite fire marshal inspections, miscommunication with actors, and any number of other troubles, the attraction does open.

The film doesn't end with opening day. It goes on to show the team as they handle the issues that come with running the attraction. The mood of the film lightens significantly, other than the continued issues between Kaley and the uncooperative partner from the original haunt, once the specter of opening day is passed. Finally ""Monsters Wanted"" concludes with the final day of the attraction for the 2011 season, showing how all the hard work and dedication by everyone involved came together to form something new and unique.

On the surface, ""Monsters Wanted"" is a documentary about opening a new haunted attraction in Louisville, Kentucky. While the mechanics of that and the challenges are interesting, the film would not be what it is if it just stopped there. The real strength of ""Monsters Wanted"" and what makes the film feel more like a narrative than a documentary, are the people behind the attraction and how the movie looks at them. Rich and Janel are not your typical couple. They are eccentric in their tastes for entertainment and how they want to spend their time. Rich gave up a lucrative mainstream job in order to pursue his dream and it isn't your typical ""American dream"". The same goes for Janel as she happily proclaims that Halloween is her favorite holiday. It would be very easy for a filmmaker to show them and their love of the macabre from a cynical, mainstream view. Instead, ""Monsters Wanted"" brings you into their world and shows them as passionate, caring people, who love their art, not the caricatures.

Another aspect of the film worth mentioning is the production quality. ""Monsters Wanted"" looks good. Documentary filmmakers shoot hundreds of hours of footage and it can be a true challenge to know what to include and what to leave out. With ""Monsters Wanted"", Cunningham was able to strike the right balance. The film is well paced with humor balancing the drama nicely, not allowing the scale to tip too far one way or the other. Additionally, I was surprised by the high end production graphics that accompanied it. Something that would in most films be a throw away caption, like the `days until opening' clock, is done in a way that makes it almost like a special effect and it enhances the viewing experience. The film is also rounded out nicely by a good soundtrack that brings out the mood of the scenes without overwhelming them. The bottom line is that ""Monsters Wanted"" is a well-made movie that entertains while giving a poignant look into an area the mainstream tends to glance over, haunts and the people who love them. So check out Brian Cunningham and Joe Laughrey's film ""Monsters Wanted"". It may not make you a fan of haunted attractions, but it will let you see the people behind the masks.",1376352000,6,6011,4.740917782026768
5855538,4,B00DTTRGJW,"As a Louisville resident, I'm pleased when something new comes to the area. The movie was shown to me at Fandom Fest; another Louisville project that's rapidly building itself up. We have the KFC Yum center, and our college; the University of Louisville, that's also making a name for itself. With all those larger projects it's easy to overlook something like a haunted attraction, but I'm glad this documentary was made. It shows Louisville isn't just a major city where people rush by each other never speaking. A LOT of people took part in this movie & in the haunted house.
I didn't know much about this movie, the first time I saw it. I was expecting a documentary about the early stages of a Halloween haunted attraction that would lead into them hearing weird sounds & seeing funny lights of in the distance. I was wrong! It's a documentary that captures the real story of a group of people, working hard to make their own business come alive. There isn't anything scary about this movie (except the money struggles they have & this isn't a spoiler, it's clear from the beginning). Good job guys.",1375315200,2,1104,4.666666666666667
5855539,5,B00DTTRGJW,"Being a Louisville native and a life long fan of horror and everything macabre I found Monsters Wanted to be quite an experience. The classic story of a couple who have a dream and will stop at nothing to accomplish the task only with a slight variation: These two are horror and thrill fanatics who wanted more from the Horror Attraction experience. They wanted a park, a park where there were no rules to scaring and frightening all ages and types. This movie not only lets you tag around with these two and their merry band of misfits and monsters but also allows the viewer to live the life of an owner/operator, and all the trials and tribulations that go along with getting off the ground in the world of business. Also in the interest of business, Monsters Wanted showcases the city of Louisville in a very hip and progressive way, highlighting many of the areas great haunted attractions and personalities. All in all, the viewer will laugh, cry, scream and rejoice as the american dream with a twist unfolds before their eyes.",1375228800,8,1035,4.66120218579235
5855540,5,B00DTTRGJW,"HILARIOUS look at what must be done to get a haunt to opening day, and beyond. Absorbing story line that shows the blood, sweat & tears that go into creating an unforgettable, terrifying experience for all who visit. Set in Louisville, Ky, it tells the story of a gorgeous, brilliant couple who share a love of all things scary (Halloween is the only holiday they celebrate!) and we get to watch while they bring their dream of a great haunt into reality. The editing was first class and the soundtrack....ahhh..LOVED IT! Excellent movie whether you are into scary things or not. It's a rare documentary that can make you laugh out loud, AND be a fan of the people featured, but this one does it!!!",1375228800,6,698,4.592
5855541,5,B00DTTRGJW,"This is an incredible documentary of the making of haunted adventures.  It documents the blood,sweat, and tears of all it takes to get an excellent experience during the haunting hours. I certainly had no idea how costly and involved behind the scenes experiences were and now understand how it takes all in the crew to work as a team to make an exciting adventure.  The content is educational,funny and sometimes downright eerie. I would recommend this film to anyone who has ever visited a haunted house.
Great fun!!",1375142400,5,518,4.875

5855543,4,B00DTTRGJW,"This DVD features a group of haunt creators, actors and producers occasionally at odds with one another, but concludes as a heartwarming tale of like-minded people building their own loving monster family.

Wonderful viewing, especially as a companion piece to The American Scream documentary, Monsters Wanted goes goes behind the screams at a haunted attraction that may well be pulling in too many directions at once.
We see how that affects those who only have the love of each other and the Halloween spirit to hold on to.

That being said, this is still a fun ride, after all, the downs are there so we really take notice of the ups. There's a lot of laughter and camaraderie on show here beside the skulls and skeletons.

As a lifelong horror and Halloween devotee, I was impressed, worried and downright weirded out by some of the goings on presented here, but still inspired to at least attempt something myself for Halloween - albeit on a much smaller scale!",1434412800,,967,4.778443113772455

5855547,5,B00DTTRGJW,"Have you ever wanted to know what its like to own and operate your own haunted attraction?  Now you can find out in this vastly entertaining and informative documentary that takes you inside the operation of the Asylum Haunted Theme park in Louisville, KY.  Thoughfly films takes you behind-the-scenes to show you incredible amount of planning, work, money, dedication, and heartache it takes to operate one of these seasonal Halloween haunted theme parks.

Written and directed by Brian Cunningham and Joe Laughrey, the documentary follows Rich Teachout and his partner and girlfriend Janel Nash in operating this Louisville haunted theme park which features four different attractions, two of which are new.  It is the planning and building of the new attractions, Zombie City and Darkness Falls that the bulk of the documentary follows.  Teachout left a lucrative job to dedicate himself full-time to the effort.

The documentary picks up months before the late September park opening as Rich, Janel, and their team of costumers and make-up artists begins the planning of the new attractions which are built on a forty acre area.  Sets are constructed, costumes are made, and auditions are held for the dozens of actors the park will require.  The team visits the Transworld show, the only trade show dedicated to Halloween d&eacute;cor, costumes, props, and animatronics.

As the days countdown the team grows more frustrated as they race to finish the park in time for the opening.  Rich and Janel become exasperated with the many details like dealing with electricians, carpenters, actors who stop showing up without notice, and surprise inspection by the city building inspectors.  Even as the first customers lineup the team is still running air hose lines and setting up lighting.  Even with glowing reviews from both customers and the media, Rich and Janeal face the cold reality that they will not make their investment back the first year as they struggle just to pay their own bills.

You cant help but admire the dedication that the entire staff has in the face of all the problems they encounter and days which last 20 hours.  Cunningham and Laughrey do a great job of letting the people tell the story as they stay back and just record the drama.  For any horror or haunted house them park fan, this is a fascinating look inside the industry.",1391299200,3,2358,4.994884910485934
5855548,4,B00DTTRGJW,"Just finished watching Monsters Wanted and I was very impressed. It's a well made and fast paced documentary about a couple who follow their dream by creating a monster theme park. It kind of makes you wish that Halloween came more than once a year. This film will leave you feeling inspired, it's great to see people who follow their dreams and make them come true. I only wish we had a monster theme park where I live. Great DVD!

5855551,5,B00DTTRGJW,"""Monsters Wanted"" delivers a poignant and oftentimes hilarious inside view of the origins and operations of a haunted attraction. Opening with an eye-catching opening credit sequence worthy of a big-budget Hollywood production, ""MW"" follows the exploits of the creators of ""The Asylum Haunted Scream Park"" as they toil, triumph and terrorize their way from leaving their full time ""Joe Jobs"" to opening day at one of Louisville, KY's largest haunted attractions. Produced by Thoughtfly Films, this independent documentary is must-see video for anyone who has ever wondered what it is like to own,operate,or work in a haunted house.

Other attractions, such as the annual Louisville Zombie Walk, are featured as well, but ""The Asylum"" is the main focus. I recommend you get your copy early, as this film is almost guaranteed to win many awards, possibly inflating the price as supplies struggle to keep up with demand.",1377129600,4,917,5.238095238095238

8597643,5,B00DTTRGJW,"As a retired ""haunter"" this film brought back some great memories of what it was like and the work that goes into celebrating the most wonderful day of the year. The film truly shows the ups and downs of the business as well as how easy it is to spend money working on these things. It is best if you can pull most of your stuff together from ""nearly free"" resources, but that only gets you so far. The creativity and the passion some of us have for this is amazing and in the end it is all just to put on a show for other people's enjoyment. The film has a lot of heart. You will enjoy watching it and you might learn a thing or two about how to (and sometime not to) run a haunt. Makes me want to get back into it....naw. Well, maybe be part of someone else's someday.....maybe.",1506643200,,780,4.071428571428571
