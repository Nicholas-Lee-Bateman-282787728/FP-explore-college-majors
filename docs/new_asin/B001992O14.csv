3426543,5,B001992O14,"For me, it would be just as nice to see a DVD copy of a VHS tape that INCLUDED the commercials, since now they are a bit of nostalgia.  This was the Regan era, after all, a decade of cold-war Americans at the pinnacle of hubris.

I would be glad to pay for the cost of the media, the shipping, and a fair amount for the trouble it took to encode and burn the disk(s).

If the copyright owner has abandoned it, I think it is fair to seek it out via other means than commercial purchase.

Please contact me if you have the show.",1343952000,2,526,3.980952380952381
3426544,5,B001992O14,"back in the 80's i never missed an episode. i was deeply saddened when i found out that this series was canceled. The TV producers must have been asleep at the wheel when they canceled this show. everyone i knew watched it. the people that they used to rate TV shows back then were either nuts or just plain brain dead and would not know a good show if it bit them. i would love to see this show brought to dvd, or better yet a new series started up on the sci fi channel.",1337472000,8,472,3.9789473684210526
3426545,5,B001992O14,"I loved the pilot for ""The Phoenix when it originally aired in 1981 and was thrilled when it was picked up for a series.  However, I don't think a mere four episodes was a fair trial, and it was cancelled far too quickly.  There were at least two and perhaps as many as four additional episodes scripted that were never filmed.  I know the pilot and episodes are available in one fashion or another whether by download or bootleg, but I'd gladly pay $25.00 to own a pristine, legal, commercial-free copy of the pilot and episodes.  An added bonus would be interviews with the cast.  A series like this is tailor made for dvd on demand!",1335398400,20,635,4.439655172413793
3426546,4,B001992O14,"To ""the powers that be""--PLEASE release ""THE PHOENIX"" (1981-82) on DVD!  This short-lived ABC-TV sci-fi show would be IDEAL for a made-on-demand DVD release.

3426547,5,B001992O14,Bennu (Judson Scott) got his powers from the sun and after his powers was restored he could perform fantastic things. I have seen lots of other series released on DVD thats not 1/10 as good as this one. Get it released and do us all a big favor.,1306800000,29,245,4.125

8272728,5,B001992O14,Adored this show .. I would have been 19 or 20 when it screened in the early 80s. Sadly only pilot & 4 eps screened.  Weird thing is I have memories of other scenes not in these eps. Would love a decent legitimate dvd copy of what is available.  How about a remake?,1454025600,,265,3.981132075471698
8272729,5,B001992O14,Watched as a child then it was cancelled. Would love to own it on DVD. I search for it about twice a year with no luck. Have never even seen it as a rerun on any channel.,1452124800,,170,3.6216216216216215
8272730,5,B001992O14,"Unlike SciFi - or Rockets and Rayguns - this show was more along the lines of true science fiction.  There was actually more plot and characterization than most of what was available at the time.  The main character actually had some viable opinions about his surroundings and how to preserve them for the future, as well as alternative, clean sources of energy.
  It truly amazes me that this show seems to basically get stashed in the basement to gather dust.  Another reviewer remarked that this show was ahead of its time, I agree.  We live in an age of sustainability and green preservation, so why doesn't this show see the light of day?
  The 70's and early 80's shows were usually vapid and thoughtless (ie., Charlie's Angels,  Bionic 'people', Monkees - one really stupid show there).  The viewing public were usually treated as having IQ's in the moronic range.  For anyone with half a brain, there wasn't much of a viewing choice available at the time.  Star Trek and this show (which didn't include someone getting killed to stimulate intellect) were among the happy exceptions .",1412035200,,1091,4.806451612903226

I'm Gabriel from Chile and I'm very interested in The Phoenix, specifically in the pilot. How can I get a copy of that and the episodes. I've looked in many sites but I've never found anything. Does anyone sell them?
