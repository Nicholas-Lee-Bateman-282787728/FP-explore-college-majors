6075453,5,B00GGZFGUW,What a refreshing video.  In today's age of doubters and cynics there are thankfully a few Carston Thiede's left in the world.  The integrity of the gospel writers is always trashed and scoffed at and it's aim is always to undermine belief.  Thiede pushes back against this onslaught with an astonishingly significant discovery.  This is a must see video and is done so well.  Thanks Amazon for putting this on the Prime video side. I would have never run into it without ya!,1339632000,8,475,4.674698795180723
6075454,5,B00GGZFGUW,"This documentary is well produced, the imagery is beautiful and the claims of the authors and guests are nothing short of astounding.  Scholars have long known the Bible is the most accurate work from antiquity known to man.  The assertions of authenticity proposed in this work move Biblical claims from well documented facts to virtual eyewitness certainty.  Muslim, Hindu, Atheist, Agnostic, Cultural Christians, Religious Christians and Christians all need to familiarize themselves with the importance of the ""Magdalene Papyrus.""  This DVD is a good place to begin.  Right or wrong, true or false the implications of this work will change the way the world understands the Bible forever.  The rules of the game have been changed!  Do yourself a favor and become an informed player in the game of life!",1325203200,13,806,5.153846153846154
8622992,5,B00GGZFGUW,Must read to establish the authenticity of the Authorized Version of the Bible translated to English from the Greek Textus Receptus. Most of the extant Greek New Testament  manuscripts and parchments agree with the Textus Receptus. Those that do not agree with the majority are declared to be older and closer to the original autographs. Dr. Thiede does amazing detective work to redate the Magdalen Papyrus. He redated it to the 1st century before the destruction of the Temple Herod reconstructed. He also remarked that the Magdalen papyrus agrees with the Greek text of the Textus Receptus.,1529971200,,593,5.11340206185567
8622993,5,B00GGZFGUW,We have more evidence about the historical accuracy of the Bible then any other literature of the past. It is clear that the God of the Bible wants to be certain that we know who He is.  Thank You God.,1494460800,,201,4.025

8622997,5,B00GGZFGUW,"Riveting from the start. Well done! I first saw this on Netflix and, as an investigative journalist myself, I was hooked. This guy crossed all the 't's and dotted all the 'i's. It is a very compelling study of the authenticity of Matthew's chronicles of Christ.

Far too many Christian documentaries skew the facts in order to fit their narrative - which, if you truly are a Christian - you would be exploring the Truth and not trying to invent it. If the Truth is what we are after, it will stand on its own. If it doesn't (and I'm thinking of the documentary on Noah's Ark made several years ago) then it will crumble, as well it should.

This film is a must-view in every single Bible study group across the globe. It gives ammunition to arguments often slung disputing if Christ even existed at all - which, curiously enough, is not an argument they use against Socrates who, like Christ, never wrote a word himself, and whose existence is known only through the writings of his disciples. Curious, that.",1432944000,2,1008,4.56353591160221
8622998,4,B00GGZFGUW,An outstanding video which details in an easy to understand way this amazing find as well as its impact on biblical criticism.,1431302400,,126,4.7727272727272725
8622999,5,B00GGZFGUW,This was a very interesting video that appeared to have been well researched.,1425254400,,77,5.0
8623000,5,B00GGZFGUW,This video documentary won't appeal to many and it is a little slow moving but it is exciting to a scholar like me.,1402444800,,115,4.043478260869565
8623001,5,B00GGZFGUW,Well done documentary. I love when they do a good science and logic based documentaries to supplement faith. This video lends support to the view that the Bible is accurate and thus supplements faith but does not replace it. Good job on this one.,1367193600,6,246,4.613636363636363
