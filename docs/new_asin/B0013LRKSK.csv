8252033,5,B0013LRKSK,It's a nice little compilation of a few episodes of Madeline and the girls going to or interacting with America/Americans. For my little niece but I sit and watch it with her all the time. Hahaha. :),1417132800,,199,4.405405405405405
8252034,5,B0013LRKSK,"My 4-year old granddaughter thoroughly enjoys Madeline videos & this one is one of her favorites, mainly because of the bonus episode. It is a ""Wild West"" theme and she is very into horses at the moment, so it has been viewed countless times. She has even memorized the theme song & sings along and dances with Madeline, which obviously this grandma finds adorable! Highly recommended for young girls.",1298678400,,401,4.826086956521739
8252035,5,B0013LRKSK,"This DVD is a reissue of older episodes of Madeline, i.e. Madeline in Hollywood and Madeline in New York. There is also a bonus episode ""Madeline and the Wild West"". Madeline and her eleven precocious friends are accompanied by Miss Clavel, the benign nun on a trip to the United States and have many exciting adventures. The stories are fun and my four-year-old daughter enjoyed the antics of Madeline and company. The picture quality is very good and apart from the three episodes, there are also other features such as an interactive storybook: Madeline by Ludwig Bemelman and a ""Watch and Read"" feature.

The episodes are in full color and total running time is 45 minutes. It comes with captions, English and Spanish subtitles [as options]. I highly recommend the Madeline series of DVDs for young children, preschoolers and up for the refreshing stories and pure sense of adventure.",1237939200,3,888,4.959731543624161
8252036,2,B0013LRKSK,"We thought this was going to be a new Madeline story...unfortunately it is the old ""Madeline in New York"" and ""Madeline in Hollywood"" repackaged in a new dvd with a new cover.  Both episodes have already been available on dvd for many years.  The ""bonus"" feature is ""Madeline and the wild west"" which may or may not be new, I'm not sure.  Too bad they cannot come up with some new episodes, instead of just a new cover to the dvd.",1219449600,9,430,4.283950617283951
