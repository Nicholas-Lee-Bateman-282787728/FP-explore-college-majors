3154689,5,B0016AK37S,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was very much worth the price I paid to get it. I would recommend the item to any fan of the Naruto series, or anime in general.",1221350400,,160,3.878787878787879
3154690,1,B0016AK37S,"I recibe to many movies and they charge me for oll went I only order

3154691,3,B0016AK37S,"The vast majority of movies adapted from TV anime -- especially for anime that are still running -- are basically like long episodes of the TV series.

That pretty much sums up the second ""Naruto"" movie, straightforwardly called ""Naruto the Movie 2: Legend of the Stone of Gelel."" It's a puff pastry of a movie, but it has pretty much everything you'd expect of a Naruto story -- lots of slam-bang fight scenes, a big dramatic threat and a megamalomaniac villain. But it also feels like the writers and designers were making a cultural potlock for maximum effect.

As the story opens, the Sand Ninja -- including Gaara and Kankuro -- are battling a band of strange armored foreigners, who also have a very impressive warship.

Elsewhere, Naruto, Sakura and Shikamaru are handling their easiest assignment -- returning a ferret to its owner. But a clash with an armored warrior named Temujin brings Naruto into contact first with a caravan of wanderers, and then with Temujin's charismatic master. Master Haido holds almost religious sway over his various followers, and insists that he and his friends are trying to create a utopia of perfect peace.

Except nothing is ever that simple in a movie, or it would be very short. Naruto follows Temujin and finds out what ""sacrifices"" are being made under Haido's orders.  And Haido's true motives are revealed when the leader of the caravan reveals an ancient story of a long-lost empire, and the staggering power that led to their destruction. Now it's up to Naruto and his friends to stop Naido, before he gets to the Mines of Gelel.

""Legend of the Stone of Gelel"" pretty much sticks to the basic ""Naruto"" anime formula -- deranged villains seeking ultimate power, nasty minions with their own set of powers, and Naruto and his pals triumphing over the baddie after getting smashed into the floor about a dozen times. It's a fluff action anime, and has few differences from the TV series, but it's pretty entertaining fluff.

The writers also throw in a rather hackneyed message about the importance of friendship and stuff. Okay Naruto, we get it -- friends are important. But along the way, it doles out plenty of fight scenes, colorful techniques, and a fairly interesting backstory for the stones of Gelel, and the remaining people from its fallen empire. It moves by at a fast clip with lots of explosive fight scenes, especially when the ever-stoic Gaara battles a woman who can control lightning.

As the plot winds on, they up the ante to make the action ever more explosive and complex, right up to a finale involving a black hole, and a massive implosion in an underground cavern.

But in their quest to amp up the action and the visuals, the makers of ""Legend of Gelel"" went a little too far. The villain and his minions dress like medieval Europeans, and the ancient empire appears to have been populated by Aztecs. What's more, the baddie is inexplicably able to turn into a rock monster, and his minion is able to turn into beasts. But we have no idea why.

None of the characters really get explored much -- Naruto is his usual bombastic, hyperactive self and spends much of the movie brooding over the injustices of what's going on, his buddies show off their special skills, and the baddie is a cackling madman. Temujin is the most deeply explored of the characters, and the writers do a pretty decent job outlining his tragic, warped personality.

""Naruto The Movie 2: Legend of the Stone of Gelel"" is an amusing, fluffy action anime that echoes the tone of the TV series, albeit with some rather bizarre trappings.",1217030400,14,3582,4.7612903225806456
3154692,4,B0016AK37S,"When I watched this movie a year or so ago I thought it was a pretty decent addition to the Naruto movies.  Now, its finally available in America to buy.  Its great that still keep the original Japanese audio for fans (like me) who prefer to listen to it in its intended language.  The only thing that bothers me (which I'm sure hasn't been fixed for this release) is when you play the English subtitles for the Japanese audio. the names are still written ""Naruto Uzumaki"" or ""Sasuke Uchiha"" yet your ears just cleary heard ""Uzumaki Naruto"" and ""Uchiha Sasuke"".  It gets extremely confusing, and I wish the subs had the names written in there original format.",1216339200,10,659,4.6068376068376065

3154694,5,B0016AK37S,"i am a forever naruto fan, this show holds such lovely memories for me, i was a loner without any friends for the longest time, and in my youth i saw the series on tv for the first time and i could not keep my eyes off of it, but eventually the broadcasting of the show was canceled on the air, and i hadn't even learned the name of the show. I had never seen it again for 4 years, when i told a person about it, trying to find out what the name was. That person not only opened my case, but she also opened my eyes to a whole other universe of anime. She became my first true friend and through her i met other people like me. the deeper i got into the anime universe the more friends i made, and i was finally happy for the first time in my life. Due to my other issues in life i was able to relate to naruto in several ways, i was put into foster care for most of my life, so i knew what it felt like to not be wanted, or need or loved, and it wasn't until one person who cared enough about me to take me into her family that i was able to see a little light. Also i was born with a physical abnormality, a cleft palate and because of it i was shunned by my school mates and i was all alone for quite some time and that didn't make my life any better, until that one person who became my first friend out of our similar favoritism of this show. I love Naruto and i will never forget just how much it has changed my life for the better. Thank You Misashi Kishimoto for creating such a wonderful manga and anime.",1450224000,,1513,3.8681672025723475

3154742,3,B0016AK37S,"The plot is okay but not great. It's your usual ""no problem job; stumble across a huge problem with an evil main character, and Naruto saves the day"" theme. Of course, Naruto is his normal whiny self, asking lots of questions and yelling for answers, and can't see what's in front of his nose. Naruto does a lot of yelling which is typical. There's very little character development on the main evil character and the two ladies help him. They just appear with no explanation about where they came from and why they are the way they are.

If you love Naruto then you'll probably like this movie a lot. If you're a casual Naruto fan then this will a ho-hum movie similar to the others with just a different cast of characters.",1419379200,,725,4.451127819548872

I  saw  the  film  six  years  ago while  i  was  house  sitting  for  my now  ex  girl friend.  I  got  bored  one  night  and  found  it  on  youtube  and  watched  it  and  i  thought  was  great
fast  forward to  now  about  a  month ago i  had re-purchased  a  new  copy  of ""Ninja Clash In the Land of Snow""
then  i  started  to  remember  the  sequel  and  a  few  days  ago  i  purchased ""Legend of the Stone of Gelel"", and  it  does  everything  a  sequel  should  its  darker,  more  action  packed  and  a  lot  of  fun,  it  may  be  worth  mentioning  that  this  one  never  get  a  theatrical  release  in the  states.  There  were  also  some  moments  of  the  film  that  were  kind  of  creepy (intionally  of  course) Like  when  Temujin  figures  out  that  his  master  murdered  his  parents  and  when  temujin  looks  at  Haido's  face  he  has  this  creepy  smile  on  his  face  that  gave  me  Chills.

When I heard that Gaara and Shikamaru were in this one I REALLY wanted to see it as they are two of my favorite characters. The movie started out very good Showcasing Gaara and Kankuro mid battle but sadly they didn't see as much screen time as I would have hoped, that didn't take away from the movie though. My one grip is that between what was going on with Gaara and his people and Naruto and his friends wasn't linked together very well and to me they seemed to be going in to separate ways till almost the end of the movie. All in all I was alot happier with this one than the First movie and now I can't wait to see movie 3 ""Guardians of the Crescent Moon Kingdom""",1280361600,,870,3.9771428571428573
3154812,4,B0016AK37S,"Naruto the Movie 2: Legend of the Stone of Gelel is the second theatrical film in the Naruto franchise.  When watching the film, it was obvious a lot of effort went into rendering the backgrounds.  However, the animation of the characters was not as strong as in the first film.  Shikamaru and Kankuro both received consistently bad animation.  The animation for Sakura would fluctuate being rather good to being very poor.  While Naruto tended to get good animation, there were sections where he would occasionally get some bad animation.  Gaara and the new characters all seemed to get consistently good animation.

When Legend of the Stone of Gelel was released on DVD, it was released as a two-disc set.  The first disc contained the film, while the second disc had all the special features.  For set up, there is a section to choose audio and subtitle options.  For audio, there is supposed to be English 5.1, English Stereo, Japanese 5.1, and Japanese Stereo.  However, if you select Japanese Stereo, it plays the English Stereo audio instead.  The only way to hear the Japanese audio on this release is to select Japanese 5.1.  There is also a section where you can turn on the audio commentary and to turn on the Pop-Up Naruto Guides.

The second disc contains seven extras.  The first is a fourteen-and-a-half minute long documentary called, ""Creating the World of Naruto the Movie 2.""  Over the course of this documentary, various people involved with the production (the Production Supervisor, a Co-Producer, the ADR Producer, the ADR Director, and the Associate Producer), as well as the English voices for Sakura, Naruto, Haido, Gaara, Shikamaru, Kankuro, Temujin, Kahiko, Fugai, and Ranke are interviewed.

The second feature is a twenty-two minute documentary titled, ""Write amd Adapt like a Ninja.""  Everyone from the first documentary, as well as a few additional staff members, talk about the steps that take place to produce the English dub of the film.  They talk about the direct translation script, script adaptation, and the voice acting stage.  The bulk of the documentary focuses on the voice acting.

The third feature is ""Words From Japan.""  This is an eight-minute interview with the Japanese Director and Character Designer.  This feature is in Japanese with English subtitles, and has occasional scenes from the film in English edited into it.  The fourth feature is a production art gallery, which is eighteen pages of line art of the new characters introduced in the film.  The fifth feature is labeled as ""Original Storyboards.""  This is done as a thirty-one minute slideshow, where each page of storyboard is only up for a couple of seconds before moving on to the next one.  You really don't have time to make out what it is you're seeing before the slideshow moves on.

The sixth feature is ""Original Japanese Movie Trailers.""  They are all in Japanese, but there are no subtitles.  This feature, which is all one chapter, runs for about eight minutes and contains eighteen trailers in all.  Some of the trailers are so similar to each other, that you swear that someone made a mistake and put the same trailer in several times in a row.  The final feature is the English trailer for the third Naruto film, Guardians of the Crescent Moon Kingdom.

Even with its faults, this movie needs to be in the DVD collection of anyone who considers themselves a fan of Naruto.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD through the King County Library System.",1278979200,,3507,4.878172588832487

The second of the Naruto movies finds our hero teaming up with some of the sand Shinobi to fight some enemies that have never been encountered before.  How will they fare?  Well considering I just reviewed the third movie and Naruto was in that one, probably fairly well.  ;)

As usual, top-notch quality.",1229385600,,518,6.787878787878788
3154816,2,B0016AK37S,"The first movie was nothing special, but it was a good transition for the series to have a movie. It had some interesting fight scenes and even a funny opening scene. It was an interesting film though, and had enough action to keep me interested.

This offering is well... in a word, awful. I saw this back in the summer and I still can't stop thinking about how dissapointed I was. I am a Naruto fan and I was rather quite excited to watch the movie. Now here's what I thought:

WHAT IT DID RIGHT:
-Good action scenes
-The scene in the beginning with the ferret and the pot was funny
-Animation was quite good
-GREAT MUSIC!!! Our favorites are used here, as with a few new songs

WHAT IT DID WRONG:
-The storyline is boring. Not slow, just boring!!!! It was very contrived and seemed to be missing lots, and rather felt derived at times.
-UNDERUSED CHARACTERS. Sasuke is only in it for (literally) 5 seconds. Gaara has a whopping 5 minutes of screen time. What happened?
-The dialoge was CORNY.
-When I read the ""Naruto"" title card, I wasn't expecting an FMA interpretation. This movie had way too much Full Metal Alchemist and 20% of it felt Naruto-esque.
-Poorly concieved new characters
-By the end, I was really cheering for the villain. And you know that's not a good thing.

Overall, this was an awful movie, and it sure feels more like a glorified fanfiction but in anime film. Only see it if you're a die hard fan.",1228176000,4,1423,4.461538461538462

3154818,5,B0016AK37S,"As the same with all the Naruto movies and the series, action packed and has good life lessons as well. Great for older children (due to blood scenes not recommended for really little children) and fun for adults who like this type of thing as well.
 Has a basic plot and story line, easy to follow, yet as usual Naruto always has a surprising plan in store for us. Great action scenes and graphics.",1227139200,,399,4.391891891891892
3154819,2,B0016AK37S,"This movie was very reminiscent of the very first ten to fifteen episodes of the Naruto series.  Problem is, this movie takes place nowhere near that timeline.  As such, this feels so rehashed and, while it embodies the 'my determination will see me through any situation', the plot just doesn't pull it off.  Honestly this feels like the characters are back-sliding in development as compared to the series.  Of all the characters Gaara seemed to be the only one that had continued to develop in the movie.  I probably could have added a star for the wonderful animation, but with the higher budget movies have you kind of expect it.",1223942400,,634,4.7272727272727275

3389188,3,B0016AK37S,"The vast majority of movies adapted from TV anime -- especially for anime that are still running -- are basically like long episodes of the TV series.

That pretty much sums up the second ""Naruto"" movie, straightforwardly called ""Naruto the Movie 2: Legend of the Stone of Gelel."" It's a puff pastry of a movie, but it has pretty much everything you'd expect of a Naruto story -- lots of slam-bang fight scenes, a big dramatic threat and a megamalomaniac villain. But it also feels like the writers and designers were making a cultural potlock for maximum effect.

As the story opens, the Sand Ninja -- including Gaara and Kankuro -- are battling a band of strange armored foreigners, who also have a very impressive warship.

Elsewhere, Naruto, Sakura and Shikamaru are handling their easiest assignment -- returning a ferret to its owner. But a clash with an armored warrior named Temujin brings Naruto into contact first with a caravan of wanderers, and then with Temujin's charismatic master. Master Haido holds almost religious sway over his various followers, and insists that he and his friends are trying to create a utopia of perfect peace.

Except nothing is ever that simple in a movie, or it would be very short. Naruto follows Temujin and finds out what ""sacrifices"" are being made under Haido's orders.  And Haido's true motives are revealed when the leader of the caravan reveals an ancient story of a long-lost empire, and the staggering power that led to their destruction. Now it's up to Naruto and his friends to stop Naido, before he gets to the Mines of Gelel.

""Legend of the Stone of Gelel"" pretty much sticks to the basic ""Naruto"" anime formula -- deranged villains seeking ultimate power, nasty minions with their own set of powers, and Naruto and his pals triumphing over the baddie after getting smashed into the floor about a dozen times. It's a fluff action anime, and has few differences from the TV series, but it's pretty entertaining fluff.

The writers also throw in a rather hackneyed message about the importance of friendship and stuff. Okay Naruto, we get it -- friends are important. But along the way, it doles out plenty of fight scenes, colorful techniques, and a fairly interesting backstory for the stones of Gelel, and the remaining people from its fallen empire. It moves by at a fast clip with lots of explosive fight scenes, especially when the ever-stoic Gaara battles a woman who can control lightning.

As the plot winds on, they up the ante to make the action ever more explosive and complex, right up to a finale involving a black hole, and a massive implosion in an underground cavern.

But in their quest to amp up the action and the visuals, the makers of ""Legend of Gelel"" went a little too far. The villain and his minions dress like medieval Europeans, and the ancient empire appears to have been populated by Aztecs. What's more, the baddie is inexplicably able to turn into a rock monster, and his minion is able to turn into beasts. But we have no idea why.

None of the characters really get explored much -- Naruto is his usual bombastic, hyperactive self and spends much of the movie brooding over the injustices of what's going on, his buddies show off their special skills, and the baddie is a cackling madman. Temujin is the most deeply explored of the characters, and the writers do a pretty decent job outlining his tragic, warped personality.

""Naruto The Movie 2: Legend of the Stone of Gelel"" is an amusing, fluffy action anime that echoes the tone of the TV series, albeit with some rather bizarre trappings.",1217030400,14,3582,4.7612903225806456
3389189,4,B0016AK37S,"When I watched this movie a year or so ago I thought it was a pretty decent addition to the Naruto movies.  Now, its finally available in America to buy.  Its great that still keep the original Japanese audio for fans (like me) who prefer to listen to it in its intended language.  The only thing that bothers me (which I'm sure hasn't been fixed for this release) is when you play the English subtitles for the Japanese audio. the names are still written ""Naruto Uzumaki"" or ""Sasuke Uchiha"" yet your ears just cleary heard ""Uzumaki Naruto"" and ""Uchiha Sasuke"".  It gets extremely confusing, and I wish the subs had the names written in there original format.",1216339200,10,659,4.6068376068376065

3389191,5,B0016AK37S,"i am a forever naruto fan, this show holds such lovely memories for me, i was a loner without any friends for the longest time, and in my youth i saw the series on tv for the first time and i could not keep my eyes off of it, but eventually the broadcasting of the show was canceled on the air, and i hadn't even learned the name of the show. I had never seen it again for 4 years, when i told a person about it, trying to find out what the name was. That person not only opened my case, but she also opened my eyes to a whole other universe of anime. She became my first true friend and through her i met other people like me. the deeper i got into the anime universe the more friends i made, and i was finally happy for the first time in my life. Due to my other issues in life i was able to relate to naruto in several ways, i was put into foster care for most of my life, so i knew what it felt like to not be wanted, or need or loved, and it wasn't until one person who cared enough about me to take me into her family that i was able to see a little light. Also i was born with a physical abnormality, a cleft palate and because of it i was shunned by my school mates and i was all alone for quite some time and that didn't make my life any better, until that one person who became my first friend out of our similar favoritism of this show. I love Naruto and i will never forget just how much it has changed my life for the better.

Of course, Naruto is his normal whiny self, asking lots of questions and yelling for answers, and can't see what's in front of his nose. Naruto does a lot of yelling which is typical. There's very little character development on the main evil character and the two ladies help him. They just appear with no explanation about where they came from and why they are the way they are.

If you love Naruto then you'll probably like this movie a lot. If you're a casual Naruto fan then this will a ho-hum movie similar to the others with just a different cast of characters.",1419379200,,725,4.451127819548872

It was a great movie then I decided I needed to get the 2nd (and of course I have now ordered the 3rd too). When I heard that Gaara and Shikamaru were in this one I REALLY wanted to see it as they are two of my favorite characters. The movie started out very good Showcasing Gaara and Kankuro mid battle but sadly they didn't see as much screen time as I would have hoped, that didn't take away from the movie though. My one grip is that between what was going on with Gaara and his people and Naruto and his friends wasn't linked together very well and to me they seemed to be going in to separate ways till almost the end of the movie. All in all I was alot happier with this one than the First movie and now I can't wait to see movie 3 ""Guardians of the Crescent Moon Kingdom""",1280361600,,870,3.9771428571428573
3389309,4,B0016AK37S,"Naruto the Movie 2: Legend of the Stone of Gelel is the second theatrical film in the Naruto franchise.  When watching the film, it was obvious a lot of effort went into rendering the backgrounds.  However, the animation of the characters was not as strong as in the first film.  Shikamaru and Kankuro both received consistently bad animation.  The animation for Sakura would fluctuate being rather good to being very poor.  While Naruto tended to get good animation, there were sections where he would occasionally get some bad animation.  Gaara and the new characters all seemed to get consistently good animation.

When Legend of the Stone of Gelel was released on DVD, it was released as a two-disc set.  The first disc contained the film, while the second disc had all the special features.  For set up, there is a section to choose audio and subtitle options.  For audio, there is supposed to be English 5.1, English Stereo, Japanese 5.1, and Japanese Stereo.  However, if you select Japanese Stereo, it plays the English Stereo audio instead.  The only way to hear the Japanese audio on this release is to select Japanese 5.1.  There is also a section where you can turn on the audio commentary and to turn on the Pop-Up Naruto Guides.

The second disc contains seven extras.  The first is a fourteen-and-a-half minute long documentary called, ""Creating the World of Naruto the Movie 2.""  Over the course of this documentary, various people involved with the production (the Production Supervisor, a Co-Producer, the ADR Producer, the ADR Director, and the Associate Producer), as well as the English voices for Sakura, Naruto, Haido, Gaara, Shikamaru, Kankuro, Temujin, Kahiko, Fugai, and Ranke are interviewed.

The second feature is a twenty-two minute documentary titled, ""Write amd Adapt like a Ninja.""  Everyone from the first documentary, as well as a few additional staff members, talk about the steps that take place to produce the English dub of the film.  They talk about the direct translation script, script adaptation, and the voice acting stage.  The bulk of the documentary focuses on the voice acting.

The third feature is ""Words From Japan.""  This is an eight-minute interview with the Japanese Director and Character Designer.  This feature is in Japanese with English subtitles, and has occasional scenes from the film in English edited into it.  The fourth feature is a production art gallery, which is eighteen pages of line art of the new characters introduced in the film.  The fifth feature is labeled as ""Original Storyboards.""  This is done as a thirty-one minute slideshow, where each page of storyboard is only up for a couple of seconds before moving on to the next one.  You really don't have time to make out what it is you're seeing before the slideshow moves on.

The sixth feature is ""Original Japanese Movie Trailers.""  They are all in Japanese, but there are no subtitles.  This feature, which is all one chapter, runs for about eight minutes and contains eighteen trailers in all.  Some of the trailers are so similar to each other, that you swear that someone made a mistake and put the same trailer in several times in a row.  The final feature is the English trailer for the third Naruto film, Guardians of the Crescent Moon Kingdom.

Even with its faults, this movie needs to be in the DVD collection of anyone who considers themselves a fan of Naruto.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD through the King County Library System.",1278979200,,3507,4.878172588832487

The second of the Naruto movies finds our hero teaming up with some of the sand Shinobi to fight some enemies that have never been encountered before.  How will they fare?  Well considering I just reviewed the third movie and Naruto was in that one, probably fairly well.  ;)

As usual, top-notch quality.",1229385600,,518,6.787878787878788
3389313,2,B0016AK37S,"The first movie was nothing special, but it was a good transition for the series to have a movie. It had some interesting fight scenes and even a funny opening scene. It was an interesting film though, and had enough action to keep me interested.

This offering is well... in a word, awful. I saw this back in the summer and I still can't stop thinking about how dissapointed I was. I am a Naruto fan and I was rather quite excited to watch the movie. Now here's what I thought:

WHAT IT DID RIGHT:
-Good action scenes
-The scene in the beginning with the ferret and the pot was funny
-Animation was quite good
-GREAT MUSIC!!! Our favorites are used here, as with a few new songs

WHAT IT DID WRONG:
-The storyline is boring. Not slow, just boring!!!! It was very contrived and seemed to be missing lots, and rather felt derived at times.
-UNDERUSED CHARACTERS. Sasuke is only in it for (literally) 5 seconds. Gaara has a whopping 5 minutes of screen time. What happened?
-The dialoge was CORNY.
-When I read the ""Naruto"" title card, I wasn't expecting an FMA interpretation. This movie had way too much Full Metal Alchemist and 20% of it felt Naruto-esque.
-Poorly concieved new characters
-By the end, I was really cheering for the villain. And you know that's not a good thing.

Overall, this was an awful movie, and it sure feels more like a glorified fanfiction but in anime film. Only see it if you're a die hard fan.",1228176000,4,1423,4.461538461538462

3389315,5,B0016AK37S,"As the same with all the Naruto movies and the series, action packed and has good life lessons as well. Great for older children (due to blood scenes not recommended for really little children) and fun for adults who like this type of thing as well.
 Has a basic plot and story line, easy to follow, yet as usual Naruto always has a surprising plan in store for us. Great action scenes and graphics.",1227139200,,399,4.391891891891892
3389316,2,B0016AK37S,"This movie was very reminiscent of the very first ten to fifteen episodes of the Naruto series.  Problem is, this movie takes place nowhere near that timeline.  As such, this feels so rehashed and, while it embodies the 'my determination will see me through any situation', the plot just doesn't pull it off.  Honestly this feels like the characters are back-sliding in development as compared to the series.  Of all the characters Gaara seemed to be the only one that had continued to develop in the movie.  I probably could have added a star for the wonderful animation, but with the higher budget movies have you kind of expect it.",1223942400,,634,4.7272727272727275
