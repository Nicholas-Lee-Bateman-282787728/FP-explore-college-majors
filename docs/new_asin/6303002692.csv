532856,5,6303002692,"""Tito And Me"" is a delightful, funny and educational film about young Zoran, the main character in the movie, who is growing up in 1950s Yugoslavia.  Recovering from WWII and under a strain from breaking up with Stalin, the times were hard in Yugoslavia, but its leader, Josip Broz Tito was exceptionally popular and much loved.  Starting in the 1950s, and each year afterwards, Yugoslavian Socialist Pioneers and Youths competed for the top spot in a competition of knowledge about Yugoslavian Revolution, Tito, and WWII.  Young Zoran entered the competition for one reason only - to be close to a girl he thinks he loves.

""Tito And Me"" portrays 1950s Yugoslavia almost to perfection (apart from apparent hostility of some characters towards Tito - this was strange as Tito was very much loved at that time).  Sprinkled with documentary footage of Tito, the movie gives a feel of true experience, that only first hand observers could have achieved.

I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to know more about what Yugoslavia was about after WWII and for the duration of Tito's rule (which ended in 1980).  Some of the humor loses out in the translation, but most of the film is easily understood, even with subtitles.",1177027200,3,1222,4.874396135265701
532857,5,6303002692,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I saw this movie for the first time when I was a young boy living in Subotica, on the North of Yugoslavia, and then I had no idea who Josip Broz Tito was. Like the movie states, at that time, Tito, the President of Yugoslavia, was more important than God. Zoran, the lovable character in the movie, starts worshiping Tito, not really understanding why. Zoran writes in a school assignment that he loves Tito more than his parents just so he can go on an excursion with Jasna, a girl he likes. In the end he realizes what are the most important things in his life. Excellent performances by Miki Manojlovic and Lazar Ristovski. Watch the movie if you want to see how popular, but at the same time unpopular Tito was at that time.

532858,4,6303002692,"This is a political comedy by the director Goran Markovic, and is set in Belgrade, circa 1954. The film's lead character is an overweight ten year-old boy named Zoran who has a bizarre, fairytale-like obsession with the communist ruler of Yugoslavia, Tito. Zoran finds his chance to show both his love of this leader and to impress his crush in an essay contest (the topic: ""Do You Love Comrade Tito and Why?"") that not only allows Zoran to go on a march to meet Tito, but also to do so alongside Jasna, his crush. It is on this march that Zoran begins to lose faith in the ideals, as his pseudo- Boy Scout leader finds him to be annoying andrather stupid. In the end, Zoran is forced to face the disappointing truth that heroes are often not much more than self-constructed icons.
Markovic offers a clever commentary on the utter absurdity of the communist system through the eyes of a child, whose reflection and understanding of reality reveal the ridiculousness of the political system (it is hinted that one man has been a victim of the political purges, while aloud, it is said he is arrested) and the elevation of Tito. At times, the script was a little dry, but overall, an interesting film about this time in Yugoslavia's history, and worth the watch.",1071619200,9,1260,4.629464285714286
532859,5,6303002692,"I thought this was a very good movie,one of the best from Yugoslavia. It is a comedy,adventure and about Tito the Yugoslav president in the 1950's. The story talks about Zoran,a 10 year old boy who likes Tito and about his family. In the film there is always something new happening and that's what makes it interesting like for example when Zoran's class goes to Tito's birthplace there is always new scenes and with each scene you see something happening instead of just seeing them go to the birthplace it also tells us what is happening on the way there. It is a very enjoyable film.*****",1020729600,4,592,4.59433962264151
532860,4,6303002692,"This is a generally amusing film, and the chubby little boy who plays the main character, Zoran, is very endearing. The movie centers around Zoran's misadventures as he tries to win the heart of the girl he has a crush on, which involves, among other things, writing a glowing paean to Yugoslavia's then president Tito as part of a school contest. His problems only get bigger after he wins the contest. The back-drop to all of this is Zoran's somewhat troubled family life, as he, his mother and father are cramped into an apartment together with relatives - which was a common aspect of Yugoslav urban life in the early 1950s when the country was being industrialized and people moved to the cities. The government often forcefully appropriated parts of larger houses or apartments and sometimes moved complete strangers in. However, one aspect of this movie is a bit dishonest: most of the adults in the film, except for Zoran's over-zealous schoolteacher, tend to be seasoned anti-Titoists. It seems a bit unrealistic to me to show people disparaging Tito during the early 1950s in the way he was criticized during the 1980s (after his death). The fact was that in the first few decades after World War II, Tito was very popular among all Yugoslavs, Serbs included. Thus, I'd say watch this film because it is funny and rather cute, but not to get an accurate picture of Belgrade's political climate in the 1950s.",970790400,27,1417,4.811475409836065
532861,5,6303002692,"Full of kind-hearted humor, abounding in hilarious episodes, this film is touching and very enjoyable!  Its familiar satirical portrayal of the  ridiculousness of obsessions associated with the Communist regime in  Eastern Europe is very low-key, highlighting the human and humanist sides  of life.  Dimitrije Vojnov (Zoran) is perfect for the role and gives an  outstanding performance.  Best to watch the film subtitled rather than  dubbed to hear Zoran's narration which is wonderfully sweet and very, very  funny.  ""Tito i ja"" is a gem not to be missed!",966729600,6,557,5.2988505747126435

7834111,4,6303002692,"My mother was from Yugoslavia. She grew up in the era of this film and I can recall her telling me at that time there was a one word answer for everything, good and bad: ""Tito""

I used to have this on VHS, I long lost it so it was a dear to see it on DVD. This version is different from the VHS I had. The translations are a little off (seriously, are they ever on target for any foreign film?) and there are a few scenes missing. After Zoran wanders home after being out at night, when he sees his family waiting at the table with the constable and after he talks with his father, there is an extended dialogue between grandpa and the constable. If I can pull it from memory Grandpa asks ""all this for Broz (Titos real last name)?"" and the constable replies ""No, for Comrade Tito"" or something.

All in all, sweet film. Kind of uplifting given the time the film was shot and all that came out of and comes out of former YU. I do recommend it.",1379203200,,943,4.091891891891892
7834112,4,6303002692,"Tito and Me was filmed right before the Third Balkans War in 1992--so it is likely one of the last major ""Yugoslavian"" movies ever made.  Told from a young boys perspective, it is a fairly light-hearted look at life in Belgrade during the late 1950s.  There is a slight undercurrent of problematic issues of life under communism (Tito-style), but the film concentrates on the young boy's day-dreaming and ""visions of Tito"" in his daily life.  Compare it to the now classic ""Christmas Story"" and you'll get an idea of its style.  The best part of the film are the numerous newsreel clips of the real Tito which are used to illustrate various parts of the story.  Worth it just for those.

Bottom line: not a great classic, but a cute, well-made movie that is enjoyable to watch.",1370736000,,777,4.635036496350365

7834114,4,6303002692,"""Tito and Me"" is a good comedy, but for many people living in Eastern Europe, this movie is also a trip to the past.
Everyone who have been pioneer himself, can imagine that he is Zoran, who are going to the trip :)
I would recommend the movie without reservation. Best to watch uncut version.
The best scene of the movie in my oppinion was where parents are reading Zoran's school assignment from the newspaper :P
But after watching the movie I really didn't understand, why was Comrade Raja arrested? Can somebody explain that?
P.S. I'm from former USSR",1207958400,,555,4.616161616161616
