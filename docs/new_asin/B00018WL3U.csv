1979470,2,B00018WL3U,"Maybe okay is too positive of a review.  This movie wasn't bad, it wasn't good, it was just there.  Not a whole lot of humor in this story about canines from outer space, but it's still a nice, wholesome, family film.  There are definitely some good scenes that children will enjoy, and the animals are definitely cute, but I can't recommend this film.  It just did nothing for me.",1078876800,2,381,4.478260869565218
1979471,5,B00018WL3U,"I put a 4-star review up here for the theatrical version.  For the DVD, I'm lifting it to a 5-star review.  I think any film that entertains and moves a person as this film does, EVEN WITH THE FIFTH VIEWING, deserves special recognition.  Yes, I picked up the DVD the first day it hit the stores, after having seen the film 4 times at the theater.  The only drawback to the DVD is that it doesn't use the original widescreen format past the opening credits.  Everything else about the film and disc deserves praise, praise, praise.
First, the film itself is a delight.  No matter what my mood to start with, after the first 20 minutes or so I always get completely into the film and by the end of it I am always feeling great about people and the world (and dogs!!)
Second, Liam Aiken (Stepmom, Sweet November, I Dreamed of Africa, Road to Perdition, The Rising Place, Law and Order) is the star of the film and gives a PERFECT performance in both comedic and dramatic ways.  He has such a wide range and the character is a round, fully realized, interesting, and sympathetic one.
Third, if you forget for a moment any other films with similar themes, you should perceive that the director did a very fine job here.  The film's pacing is good.  It's loaded with gags and details to savor both on initial and later viewings, and even if not all the gags work for some audiences, I don't think there are any missteps so serious that they would actually diminish the enjoyment of the film.
Fourth, the script is compassionate and very moving and heartwarming and basically recalled to me what it is about really good films that makes me love the cinema.
Fifth, the DVD is loaded with great extras.  There are 6 minutes of deleted scenes that are absolutely great!  There is audio commentary available during both the deleted scenes, and during the full feature film (with director John Hoffman, star Liam Aiken, and co-star Molly Shannon).  There are documentaries about the making of the film, about dog training, bonus features and gags about the dogs.
There are even two HIDDEN features to be found on the second ""Special Features"" menu screen.  Clicking to the very top reveals a new option called ""Bark!"" that when selected shows us an absolutely riveting film clip from Liam's audition in which he gives an all-out tearjerking version of the ""Please keep the dogs on earth"" plea.  Surely there is an Oscar in this actor's future!!  Then, clicking to the left of the menu reveals a ""Woof!"" selection showing Liam receiving a surprise gift dog from the ""Good Boy!"" crew during a staged scene they set up for him.
This is a delightful film and the DVD provides so much material for viewing and re-viewing.  Buy it now!!",1078272000,6,2719,4.609958506224066
1979472,4,B00018WL3U,"Owen (Liam Aiken) has always loved dogs.  He has a hard time making friends with children of his own age, so he spends his time with the neighborhood dogs and earns money as a dog walker.  His mom and dad are into refurbishing homes so Owen moves a lot and has never been able to get a dog of his own, but he is finally able to wear them down.  At the pound Owen chose a cute little dog that he named Hubble (voiced by Matthew Broderick) who refused to act like a normal dog.  Owen found out why when he followed Hubble to his crashed spaceship where a freak electronic pulse enabled Owen to understand what dogs were saying.
From there, Owen's life just gets weirder as Hubble explains that dogs were sent here from outer space to rule the planet, not to be pets for humans.  What is even worse is that the Greater Dane, the ruler of all dogs, will be coming to Earth soon to see what progress the dogs have made.  Hubble does his best to train the neighborhood dogs to act as rulers of the planet, but he fears that he is too late.  When a series of events lead to a disastrous meeting with the Greater Dane, Owen must try and prevent a catastrophe from happening - for the Greater Dane has called for planet recall and is going to take all the Earth dogs back to the Dog Star...
This was a charming, slightly silly children's movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family (adults included!).  There is nothing particularly original about the plot, but Liam Aiken is charming as Owen and the dogs are hilarious as they try to act like rulers of the planet and teach Hubble how to catch a ball.  The movie is simple, but it goes by very quickly and you never feel like the time is dragging.  If your children love dogs or you are a dog lover yourself, you should not pass up the chance to see this great movie!",1074729600,3,1811,4.208092485549133
1979473,4,B00018WL3U,"Often, after seeing a movie, I wish I had spent my time more wisely. Not so with this film! My 7 and a half year old son both enjoyed this film. It has lots of laughs, a good-hearted responsible child as its hero, an adequate storyline, and features -- drumroll, please -- involved parents. Wow!
Make more of these, Hollywood. And if you're wondering why there weren't more box office revenues from the film, look at the Marketing budget you allocated to Good Boy vs. Spider Man.",1069718400,5,479,4.517241379310345
1979474,4,B00018WL3U,"Compassion is a tough-sell in today's movie marketplace (within the ""Culture of Fear"").  70% of the product in the theaters is packaged around the industrial ingredient of violence.  One of the alternatives provided to modern audiences that don't want to be abused with antisocial content is to swallow one's adult pride and try to regress to one's youth and check out this type of film.  It's not perfect, but its heart is ultimately in the right place.  Yes, I know... too many bathroom jokes.  It really didn't need any, but they put them in there all the same.  On the other hand, seeing this film has reminded me what gets people into films in the first place...a sense of wonder and sharing and sympathy and sensing that maybe others really do have similar basic human needs as ourselves...before we're trained to think that everything on film has to be about violence and rebellion and, uh, you know, other crude content.  Enough disclaimer.  Underneath all of the gags and marketing, the main thing about this film is that it shows compassion.  Isn't that more important than anything else in the theaters right now?  Isn't that more important than identifying where this theme and that one has been done before in ""E.T."", ""Cats & Dogs"", etc.?  Gotta vote with $$$ though.  When Matrix clones fill the multiplex screens with their ridiculous mayhem and insidious cynicism, I made sure that my $$$ was more carefully spent, by seeing this film for a second time, and enjoying it even more than I had on the first viewing.  But programming runs deep.  How many adults would dare to see a film like this and admit that it had good things in it... things that outweigh its flaws.  I hope that the producers and Hollywood in general notes that this film succeeds NOT because of the crude gags but because of the sentimental themes underlying it.  Sometimes, the stories told with children are really addressing the most basic human feelings after all.  And don't most people really want some order and stability in their lives?  That's what this film is all about, and I happily turn away from all the cynicism and mayhem and counterculture for each pleasant 90 minute viewing of this modest yet ultimately successful little film.  May we have more films like this, and with that greater quantity to choose from, some of those efforts will prove to be true gems!  I have to add that the mixture of trained animals, special effects, and human actors is very impressive.  The focus of that mixture is an outstanding, nuanced, earnest, humorous, and moving performance by the film's central actor Liam Aiken.  (Is it possible for a youngster to be nominated for a Best Actor award when his performance appears in an imperfect comedy film??  No one would probably be so bold, but then I've never considered the subject before seeing this.  I think the range of performance here was much wider and contextually more difficult to pull off than the Osment-nominating ""Sixth Sense"" performance!  Director Hoffman also deserves much credit for his critically underappreciated accomplishment here.  Did no one recognize the enormous technical difficulties and performer demands in making such a film?  I suppose since ""Babe"" came out first, everyone takes such things for granted now.)",1067990400,3,3278,4.891304347826087
1979475,3,B00018WL3U,"Think that the worlds going to the dogs?  Some people wouldnt have a problem with that  especially a young boy named Owen who seems to know everything there is to know about mans best friend.  Living in one of those idyllic towns that exist only on the Disney Channel (actually in British Columbia), Owen gets in touch with his inner canine by walking everybody elses dog, and counting down the days until his parent will let him adopt a dog of his own.  When he gets his chance, he adopts an enigmatic little dog that turns out to be from outer space.  Owen thinks the dog is strange but otherwise just another dog, and names him Hubble (I guess hes also an astronomy buff).  Hubbles world, we learn, first colonized Earth centuries ago and, as far as they're concerned, they are the ones who are supposed to be in charge.  When Owen catches Hubble in the act of communicating with the home planet, Owen suddenly (and accidentally) becomes capable of being able to speak and understand his new dog  and just about all dogs.  He also learns that Hubbles mission is critical  should the homeworld prove unhappy with the progress of the Earth dogs, they will begin a global-recall of all dogs.  At first, the earth dogs feel that they're safe that theyll pass the test  after all, if they didn't run Earth, then why is man picking up after them?  Hubble isn't impressed  Youre pets! he tells them accusingly.  When Hubble learns that his ruler  the Greater Dane herself is enroute to Earth, the situation becomes even more desperate.  Though looking down on Owen at first, Hubble and the boy join forces to bring the dogs of Earth up to speed.
This was a rather slim flick  like a Disney Channel movie that youll pay $7.50 to see.  Good Boy has a rather simple idea  Earth Needs Dogs. Theyre our pets, but we need them all the same (a point the flicks makes rather pointedly in a touching montage as the dogs face the prospect of global recall).  The laughs aren't fierce even though Owens parents are played by SNL alums Kevin Nealon and Molly Shannon and one of the dogs is voiced by Rob Reiner.  The voices are actually a bit anonymous (its hard to connect the neurotic dog with the voice of Brittany Murphy).  Still, if its a flick that won't rock your world, your kids will still love it.  My 6 year older loved it, and she cant even stand dogs.",1066608000,2,2348,4.470588235294118

1979526,1,B00018WL3U,"I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an ""Amazon"" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!!

Owen discovers that Hubble, his dog, was sent from the home planet to find out why dogs aren't ruling the planet as they were sent do to. Hubble has no idea how to be a human dog and is rather uppity.  But the love of a good little boy gets to him eventually. Alas, the great Dane leader comes down and is disgusted and orders all the dogs home.  Just going to say this actually is pretty sad. Owen makes an impassioned plea talking about all the good things that dogs do for us humans and thinking about how they could all vanish, god, makes you want to run down to the local MSPCA and adopt them all. But they eventually all come back. But, at a cost, Owen will no longer be able to understand them.  Just as well.  Really cute movie.",1437868800,,1019,4.152284263959391

1979636,1,B00018WL3U,"This movie should be euthanized.

Oscar Wilde famously said ""There is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are merely well-written or not.""

This, of course, is not wholly true. (Wilde loved to offend people's sensibilities.) Books can be moral, immoral, or amoral, depending on the values they espouse or reject. But that doesn't mean that any and every ""moral"" book or film is suitable for children.

For more than 60 years, adults have used television to baby-sit their kids. There's a huge market for ""family-friendly"" films to keep the CHILL-dren mentally stultified. Because it's far easier to churn out dog poop than kibble, most of these films are wretched garbage. Whether or not they instill good values (I don't think films or TV shows can do that -- only human interaction can), they do instill an ""appreciation"" of poorly conceived and unimaginatively executed ""art"".

I'm amazed at the number of TV-generation adults who think junk such as ""Dennis the Menace"" or ""Scooby-Doo"" actually has value, even as simple entertainment. These and a myriad of other time wasters do nothing more than fill up the space between the commercials. When someone says they have fond childhood memories of ""Jonny Quest"" or ""The Flintstones"", I know their mind has been messed with in a way that even the most-sophisticated government implant can't duplicate.

Is it too much to ask that children be exposed to /high-quality/ entertainment, rather than mind-rotting c***? Bad entertainment perverts children's tastes in a way that seems irreversible. When kids have never seen anything /good/, they grow up with an inability to discriminate. Not understanding that there /is/ a difference between ""good"" and ""bad"" music, literature, movies, etc, they fail to develop critical faculties in other areas.

""Good Boy!"" is such a bad film you don't even have to have the sound on to recognize it. The characters are shallow stereotypes (eg, the goofy/obese dogcatcher stuffing his face in every scene). The acting and direction are at a level that even a feeble-minded 6-year-old will not have a problem with. The blatant promotion of Iams products can't be overlooked, either.

If you're about to purchase ""Good Boy!"", restrain your hand. Get Disney's ""Treasure Island"" or ""20,000 Leagues under the Sea"". Either is infinitely better than this pile of dog droppings. More significantly, both films raise moral issues you can discuss with your children. When was the last time you discussed /anything/ with your kids? Do you think sending them to Sunday School, or forcing them to read the Bible, is going to develop their moral sense? It doesn't work that way.

""Garbage in, garbage out."" Think of that the next time you expose your children to movies, music, or books that have no ""quality"" or value.",1304726400,3,2800,5.058568329718004

The storyline seemed to drag on with no real clear way that it all worked out- it just did (surprise!).  The ""mild crude humor"" wasn't needed for the story and had the kids all turning to me with ""uh-oh"" on their faces.  Kids can have a healthy sense of humor without the farting and playground humor.

The parents seemed very out of place and awkward.

FYI- there is a alternative lifestyle protrayed in the movie.

1979683,3,B00018WL3U,"'Good Boy!' is a family-oriented picture about the friendship between a lonely boy and a dog coming from outer space.  Actually, all the dogs living on the Earth are originally from another planet.  Am I boring you?  But this is the basic story of 'Good Boy!' which, surprisingly, remained in the US Top 10 box-office hit chart for three weeks.  Anyone who has a soft spot for dogs would love the film.  And what if you don't?  You still may like it, or may be diappointed with it.  It depends partly on whether or not you have seen 'ET.'

I'm not saying 'Good Boy!' is a rip-off.  It has some originality, and very clever dogs too.  Well, here's the original concept.  American boy Owen (Liam Aiken) has one such dog named Hubble (perfectly voiced by Matthew Broderick).  Hubble can do 'sit' 'stay' roll over' and even 'play dead' even though it's only yesterday that Owen adopted this terrier.  And suddenly Owen realizes the reason.  For Owen starts to understand what the dogs are talking after a very weird accident happened to him.

See?  Don't say 'Doctor Dolittle' now, for world-weary Hubble has actually a mission; he has to report how the Earth Dogs are ruling the planet.  According to him, dogs are supposed to dominate the humans instead of being the best friend of them, and if they fail to do so, they are transported back to the home ... it starts to sound like 'ET' again.

For all its stock characters and weak jokes, 'Good Boy!' is not a bad film, and it convincingly shows the bond between Owen and Hubble.  All the dogs (voice cast including Brittany Murphy and Carl Reiner) are lovable, and the dog trainers did a great job to make them act like humans, without using too many CGIs.  Compared to them, Molly Shannon and Kevin Nealon who play the parents of Liam Aiken's boy do not fare well, for they are not required to do much in the film.

But the film fails to develop the original concepts about the origin of the dogs, and the 90 minutes of the film looks padded out with silly jokes including obligatory fart gags for children.  The dog's great leader 'The Greater Dane' (voiced by none other than Vanessa Redgrave) visits the Earth to inspect the Earth Dogs and ... nothing remarkable happens in the story.  The ""henchman"" of Her Majesty looks like a rat in a wig (voiced by Cheech Marin), and that's all.  First-time director John Roberts Hoffman completely misses this great opportunity to match these voice talents to make good laughs, and that's only one of the many examples of his inept decisions.

'Good Boy!' is good when it focuses upon the universal theme -- frienship, and on that score I think it is successful.  But as to its interesting premises, they need more improvements or better ideas than disrupted radio contact, flying high in the air, and a big UFO.  Steven Spielberg has already shown all of them.",1112400000,,2853,4.598019801980198

It may seem like a copy of other movies in certain ways, but it is so well done, funny, sweet and poignant.  And the little boy who stars in it does a wonderful job.

1979686,1,B00018WL3U,"""Good Boy!"" plays a bit like a low budget ""E.T."" on acid.  It tells the story of a lonely suburban boy named Owen who becomes best friends with a dog from outer space whose vehicle crash lands in a nearby woods.  The pooch gives Owen the ability to communicate verbally with him and all the other dogs in the neighborhood.  Thus, we have the umpteenth variation on the talking animal syndrome begun so successfully with ""Babe"" almost ten years ago.  ""Good Boy,"" in a way, is for all those who expected ""Snow Dogs"" to feature chatty canines only to discover that the dogs in that movie spoke only in one very short fantasy sequence (the ads for the film did a good job bamboozling patrons into thinking otherwise).

""Good Boy,"" which does feature a cast of jabbering canines, proves that we've come a long way since ""Babe"" - and not, I'm sorry to say, in the right direction.  Despite voiceover work from some pretty impressive big name actors (Matthew Broderick, Delta Burke, Cheech Marin, Vanessa Redgrave), ""Good Boy"" is one ghastly little movie, fine for those between the ages of 5 and 10, I suppose, but worthless for just about anyone else.  Adults will be frankly bored by this low grade little fantasy that offers a dopey plot, inane dialogue, cheesy special effects and enough flatulence jokes to keep 'em rolling in the aisles at the local nursery school (fart jokes seem to be practically a prerequisite for any film aimed at the grade school set these days).  The screenplay wobbles back and forth between half-assed cynical wisecracks and goopy sentimentality regarding the eternal verities of man/dog relationships.

A lonely little boy (played quite well by Liam Aiken) adopts this dog from the pound and soon becomes able to hear what his new pet is saying, but also all the other dogs he has been walking.  The dogs are delightful and the process in which they speak is well done; they really look like they are talking!  Director John Hoffman keeps the saccharine level fairly low and the movie can't help but make you smile, chuckle, and delight in these canine antics.

He has been sent here from the dog star Sirius to check on the status of the dogs on planet earth. After all, they should be ruling man, not being his best friend.
 Due to an unexpected happening Owen is able to understand what Hubble is saying, along with all the other dogs that have been in his charge.  It's a giggle a minute as the dogs voice what we as humans have only imagined they might say, your children will love it.
  There is a problem though, The Greater Dane is coming to earth to see how well the dogs are ruling man.  What will happen when she finds out this is not the case?
