1711274,4,B000066739,"Originally entitled ""Attack 1,000,000 Power Warriors"", ""The Return of Cooler"" is a continuation of the story as it was left at the end of ""Cooler's Revenge"". As such that movie should most definitely be viewed prior to this one, otherwise the storyline may come off as a bit confusing. Following the defeat of Cooler at the hands of Goku & Co. Dende, the God of Earth recieves a distressing message from planet New Namek. Apparently the planet has become host to the parasitic Big Gheti Star: a gigantic metallic saprophyte which attaches to worlds and drains them of their genki (life) energy. The unfortunate Nameks have also been personally victimized (AGAIN!) in that they are being herded into Big Gheti Star to be executed and used as a further genki energy source. At the request of Dende; Goku, Gohan, Krillin, Piccolo, Yajirobi, Master Roshi & Oolong(?) travel to New Namek to investigate the situation. The Z Warriors soon come under fire from the minions of Big Gheti Star. After handily swatting down these pests, Goku is confronted by a new challenge, Cooler! The brother of Frieza, thought to have been killed in their previous conflict (pitched into the sun), he has returned in a new, metallic form, to wreak his terrible vengeance upon the Saiyan monkey who has caused his downfall. It soon becomes VERY obvious to Goku that Cooler's new strength is beyond his ability to overcome, even when transformed into a mighty Super Saiyan. When all seems lost, and Goku is at the mercy of the metallic Cooler, he is rescued by the most unlikely of heroes...the Prince of all Saiyans, Vegeta. Together, & with much effort, they overcome Metal Cooler. Their victory is short-lived, however as they are immediately confronted by an entire army of Metal Coolers. After a brave but ultimately futile stand against the horde, the Saiyan duo is imprisoned aboard the Big Gheti Star, to be drained of their nearly limitless ki, until death. The pair prove to be more than Cooler bargained for, however, when they overload their restraints and begin an attack on Big Gheti Star itself. After a pitched battle in which Vegeta is forced to abandon his pridefulness & wrath in order that they may both survive the conflict, Cooler & the Big Gheti Star are destroyed and the Saiyans return to New Namek, after the prisoners are liberated from it by Piccolo.
This is the 6th DBZ film...& my second favorite, following Dead Zone. It is standard DBZ feature fare, a pitched battle but not much in the way of character development or interaction. It's definitely one hell of ride. I have yet to see the English dub but I'm sure that we're in for another FUNimation style ADR, with lots of added dialogue & the heavy rock soundtrack.  Anyway, 4.5 stars, fun but not essential to the DBZ plotline.",1024099200,,2787,4.794178794178794
1711275,5,B000066739,"The reason I rate this movie so high (having already seen it), is that the fights are more technical than they have been before. What I mean is instead of the plain old punch-you-a-hundred-times routine we see so often, in this movie it's almost like a well choreographed jackie chan movie. Once you see the first battle with cooler, vegeta, and goku you'll see what I'm saying. It's not all big explosions and flurries of kicks and punches.  It makes for a nice change of pace. I saw this movie before cooler's revenge, and it's nowhere near as good as this.",1020556800,,559,4.534653465346534

1711283,5,B000066739,"The Return of Cooler is better than the previous Cooler movie. If you thought Cooler was hard in the first one then you're in for a surprise. Cooler was regenerated by a sentient planet called the Big Gete Star. He has a metal body and his consciousness merged with the star. This makes him all powerful. He is using the power of the star to enslave and take over New Namek. Goku and his pals go there to put a stop to it. This is also the first appearance of Vegeta in a DBZ movie. He plays a crucial role in the defeat of Cooler.

I can say without a doubt that this is one of the top 5 DBZ films. Maybe even top 3! You have to check it out.",1351555200,,643,3.9083969465648853

Gohan, Piccolo, and Krillin vs Cooler's 2nd pair of henchmen aka the cyclopian guards, Goku vs Meta Cooler, Super Saiyan Goku vs Meta Cooler, Super Saiyan Goku and Super Saiyan Vegeta vs Meta Cooler.

1711292,4,B000066739,"This movie is the fifth in the popular manga/anime series ""Dragonball Z"". I decided to purchase it to complete my movie collection of the series. It was originally released in 1992 under the title ""Dragon Ball Z: Clash!! 10,000,000,000 Powerful Warriors"". As to not give away most the film's plot, this film sees the return of Cooler(Koola). He sees to take over New Namek and enslave the inhabitants of the planet. Dende the new Kami(god) of Earth enlists the aid of Goku and company to help save the planet from destruction. While arriving on New Namek, they see Coola reborn due to the help of the Big Gete Star(a mechancial planet that absorbs planets). Vegeta arrives,himself making his first movie appearance,and the battle starts. This film also sees Gohan,Krillin,Piccolo,Master Roshi,and Yajirobe making appearances and doing a little fighting of their own.

A decent Dragonball Z movie at best, I rate it about 3.5 to 4 stars out of five. Any fan of Dragonball Z would enjoy this movie. I do not recommend this film to anyone who has not seen Dragonball and Dragonball Z as it will confuse them. The movies are not a part of the regular storyline, but their own seperate universe according to series creator Akira Toriyma.

Having seen both the English and Japanese versions, I prefer the Japanese due to the score. The English version has some rock music in it, but the music doesn't fit the film at all. I am a avid listenere to rock music, but it has no place in Dragonball at all. Script wise, there are minor differences between the English and Japanese but not enough to really notice.

A Mr. Daimao Raki review done for Ebay/Amazon",1224115200,,1648,4.755244755244755
1711293,4,B000066739,"After their fierce battle concluded on planet Earth, Goku finished off Cooler by firing a Kamehameha at him that launched him into the sun. Little did Goku know that Cooler had fused with a machine planet known as the Big Gete Star, which grants him the ability to make limitless copies of himself, so long as he can use other planets as an energy source. Cooler now sets his sights on New Namek, and it's now up to the Z Fighters to protect the Namekians and beat Cooler once and for all.

The Return of Cooler, a direct follow up to Cooler's Revenge, brings Frieza's brother back into the spotlight and marks the first appearance of Vegeta in a Dragonball Z movie. This time, Cooler has gone mechanical much like Frieza himself had done, only with more unique powers at his disposal. This film is a great successor to the DBZ movie franchise and truly builds up steam for the rest of them. Having Vegeta appear was a great addition as well, as his character is a sharp contrast to Goku's and gives this feature a more diverse cast. Watching the two Super Saiyans duke it out with millions of Metal Coolers is worth the price of admission in itself. The rest of the movie is well paced and does well to create a satisfying climax. The music is a large improvement over the last two, and is not as distracting. The English voices are what you would expect from FUNimation, so if you're a fan of the Japanese version, this will not convert you by any means.

If you're a Dragonball Z fan, I shouldn't need to tell you to check this one out. If you've seen Cooler's Revenge, you should watch this anyway to see how the showdown with Cooler finally ends. Definately worth a purchase.",1184716800,2,1680,4.451298701298701

Vegeta arrives later on to fight by Goku's side weather he like's it or not. It turn out their are over hundereds of cyborgs that looks like Cooler how did they survive well go see it.",1120089600,2,551,4.359223300970874
1711295,4,B000066739,"No offense, but this movie could've turned out more better if they were to have Trunks on there. But overall, it was a good movie. What I liked the most is Goku vs. Meta-Cooler. I mean, talk about intense battling. What was dumb enough is Vegeta getting his ass kicked even as a super saiyan, he still sucks! But like I said, ""Cool movie, but it could have been better!""",1076112000,,370,4.3
1711296,5,B000066739,"This movie is awesome. This is the second movie with cooler. It starts out with a big silver planet called the big getti star trying to what looks like eat the new planet namek. Dende feels the fear of his people and asks Goku and the Z warriors to help them. They fly off the new namek to find the namekian race enslaved by these robots. The person behind this, is cooler, but he's different. He has a new metal body. Goku needs to defeat cooler while saving planet namek. This is what I think to be one of the best DBZ movies out there. Great Battle Scenes.",1069545600,,559,4.185185185185185
1711297,5,B000066739,"Now this was a primary example of how to make a good hour-long fight scene, unlike DBZ movie 7, which came after this one, and has to be the worst DBZ movie to date.  But let's talke about this one.  Yes, like Frieza, Cooler becomes a cyborg, luckily, it's done in an imaginitive way that keeps it from becoming a rehash of what happened to Cooler's dear brother.  The best part of this film is that Goku and Vegeta actually have to put aside their differences and WORK TOGETHER, something which they pretty much haven't done before.  That, and we get to see them both in SSJ form double-teaming Meta-Cooler, and even then they still can't defeat him!  Kuririn, Muten Roshi, Oolong, and Yajirobe are pretty much comic relief in this one, as all of them and Gohan are captured by Cooler's androids, and it's up to Piccolo to save them.  Of course, we don't care about that, we want to see Goku and Vegeta double-teaming an evil robot with the mind of an alien, and have to go all-out to defeat it.  So there.",1067904000,4,1007,4.410810810810811
1711298,4,B000066739,"Well, I really didn't like this one as much as the last movie (Cooler's Revenge).  The explaination for his return is great though.  And we do finally get to see Vegeta in a movie.  But, it's not quite enough to raise it above the last in my opinion.  The Japanese voices are as great as ever, but the recycled music is kinda... well, old.  The English dub is also sub-par.  The music in the English version is what really killed it though.  Compared to the metal rock in the last movie (which really gave the fights that extra push), this weird synthesized score really grates on my ears and makes the movie seem drawn out and slow.  I guess comparing the Japanese versions of Cooler's Revenge and The Return of Cooler put them on equal footing.  If you consider the English versions, this one falls a little short unfortunately.  It's still a good DBZ movie and the fights are still really fun.  But it's just not quite as good as the last.  Good buy for a DBZ fan.
As always, it upsets me to see that FUNimation refuses to put these movies out in their original widescreen format.  What is up with that?",1061510400,,1106,4.389162561576355
1711299,4,B000066739,I would have to say that this movie is better than Cooler's Revenge.  If you liked Cooler's Revenge than definently get this one.  It has all the clasic combat you love about DragonballZ and twists and turns all over the place.  One plus is that you get to see New Namek(You may not like it at the begining but after they clean up it looks better).  And also you get to see Vegeta's full Super Saiyan abilities.  I truly think this deserves all four out of five stars the producers really outdid themselves.,1054252800,,507,4.408602150537634
1711300,5,B000066739,"Yes, I must admit Cooler's Revenge was better.  But this movie was still excellent, even if you haven't seen CR.  The story is as follows: New Namek is assaulted by a giant mechanical orb called the Big Gete Star.  Goku and friends arrive to stop the destruction of the planet, and ultimately have to face Cooler (Meta-Cooler), who has been resurrected as the alter-ego of the Gete Star's mainframe.  I'd admit the whole thing of Cooler's resurrection is kinda cheesy, but nevertheless he's really badass, having this symbiotic relationship with a seemingly indestructible computer.  The fight scenes are awesome, although I refuse to believe that Piccolo can survive having several barrels of machine gun fire directly into his head.  I mean, he is a Z-Fighter, and therefore can take minimal damage by sheer will power, but even that scene I find over-the-top . . . then again, it is DBZ.  Best of all is Vegeta's surprise appearance while Goku fights Meta-Cooler.  Without Vegeta's assistance, Cooler would've on hands down--which reminds me: this one has one of the most unusual and inventive villain-defeats ever, although I won't spoil it for you.  In short, this Dragonball Z feature is superb, and sadly underrated.  Peace.",1053216000,,1231,5.0495049504950495

1711302,1,B000066739,"I see an anime like this and I wonder. Why?  Why did they waste their time, and money? Why did I waste my time and money?  What's the point of even making an anime feature or series if your not gonna put the time and effort into it to make it atleast tolerable?
The movie is suppose to be a sequel to the first feature with Cooler in it.  The Revenge of Cooler.  But the two are totally unreleated outside of the fact that Cooler is in both of them.  Cooler was beaten badly by Goku in the previous film, now he's back, one with a super computer that found his scattered body floating in space.  Together they become the Big Getti Star, and they travel to Namek for reasons undisclosed.  They attach themselves to the planet of Namek in a parasitic fashion and enslave it's inhabitants.  This is were the Z fighters come in.  They're apparently on vacation and they were visiting Namek anyway, so everything works out.  The fighters arrive, they fight a bunch of giant robots which obviously aren't going to be a factor, the Cooler makes his apperance as the new and improved T2 Cooler.  Dipped in mercury, the new Cooler is far more powerful and while the rest of the Z fighters duke it out with weak robots they should be able to defeat handily, Goku and Cooler begin their rematch.
Some of the action sequences are very cool, I will admit.  The one thing the Dragon Ball Z series will not let you down on is some good ol' fashion punching and kicking.  But not even the apperance of Vegita can save this steaming pile of nonsense.  The story is stupid, plain and simple, there's nothing else to call it.  If your a fan of even mediocre story telling, it's stupid.  The plot is forced, rushed(hence the 40 minute running time), and unrelated to any thing DB or DBZ except for the use of the characters.  It makes no sense even in the fantasy world of DragonBall Z where power levels are kept secret, time lines don't exist, and a female android can give birth to a human child.  The animation is average.  It's not bad, but it's nothing to write home about.  That goes with most all things DBZ, so that's no surprise.  Maybe the production company and creators behind DBZ will finally get enough money from merchandising to spend some real cash on some good animation.
The end of the movie is the worst part.  Once again DBZ movies rewrite the book on how to make a totally anti-climatic ending to a Saga or a feature.  It takes the combined forces of Vegita and Goku to destroy just one Metal Cooler. When it's revealed to you that there are like a million Metal Coolers all at the same power level you begin to wonder.  What are the robots the Z fighters face at the begining for?  Why does Cooler attempt to use Goku and Vegita to power the Star when he has a million other fighters far more powerful?  And were the hell does Vegita come from.  How would he know about this as it's happening?  Why can Cooler not stop Goku and Vegita from overloading the ship at the end?  Questions that can't be answered.  Why, because that's what bad story telling does to an already weak story. Do not rent this movie. Don't purchase this movie unless they promise you Jennifer Love Hewitt will come with it and make love to you while you watch it.  Even if your over a friends house and he has it, and decides to pop it in, stop him, warn him of the risks.  Just like friends don't let friends drive drunk.",1043712000,2,3399,4.3630573248407645
1711303,4,B000066739,"I remember that one of the biggest complaints for Coolers Revenge was the LAck of Vegeta.  Well according to the mainstream story line he was either A: Training barbarically hard in the Capsule, B: Critically injured becasue of training and was in the sack with Bulnma or C: In Space Training.  With that said the story revolves around the Z fighters traeling to New Namek to take on a new menace that is attacking the NAmekians.  The crew is GOku, GOhan, Krillin, Oolong, and I think Piccolo (I am going based off memory here).  Once there they take on these cybornetic Beings that are challenging but not to bad.  Than Later COoler himself Shows up in a new Chrome outfit to take on Goku.  THey prove to be evenly matched as the otehr head towards the villians base to take it down.  SOmewhre along the lines Vegeta shows up as backup but early on just gets in the way.  LAter the two are captured and while in Super Sayin form release enough energy that COolers main frame (only his head and slight chunks of his body was saved from the sun) and destroy the ship.  In which case Vegeta leaves as quickly as he came.
Overall this is a good follow up to Coolers REvenge, however it s once again a 45 minut short.  It's not truely a movie but at the same time doesn't quite fit anywhere in the story line (it looks like it takes somewhere during the Android Saga or maybe Cell).  Overall it's a must buy for DBZ fans, a rentla for others.",1034294400,,1438,4.348314606741573
1711304,5,B000066739,"Compared to the it's sister video, COOLER'S REVENGE, THE RETURN OF COOLER is soooo much better.  This video is the first, of those I own, that has Vegeta involved.  When Vegeta figures he can't fight Cooler on his own, Goku says they must work together.  Of course, Vegeta says stay out of his way, but he doesn't do ANYTHING to stop Goku from helping him!  I was impressed and shocked.  In COOLER'S REVENGE, Goku doesn't turn Super Saiyan until the end - bummer-, but in THE RETURN OF COOLER, just when you think Vegeta and Goku couldn't be their super selves anymore, they prove you wrong!  I recommend for anyone who either has or has not seen COOLER'S REVENGE to get this video.  You will not be disappointed!",1032825600,2,713,4.5234375
1711305,5,B000066739,"I some ways, I kind of feel sorry for the Japanese. They don't get to experience the drama of Dragon Ball Z. The drama in the English version is very well done, especially the music. I noticed that they hardly have any music during their features, and when they do it sounds like old Godzilla horror music. I am sure they would love to hear the excellent music that was created for the English versions. Well now to the main point. This movie was very well done. It is probably one of the best ones out there right now. Although I havn't seen ""Cooler's Revenge"" ( I don't know why ) I have seen all the others. I have to say I was very Impressed. This movie tops ""Lord Slug"" any day. So if you are looking for something to really wet your Dragon Ball Z appetite till the next movie comes out, featuring Androids 13, 14, and 15; buy the uncut version of ""The Return of Cooler"". With it's interesting storyline, and fast paced battle action, your sure to grab onto your seat.",1030060800,,973,4.293478260869565
1711306,4,B000066739,"Oh, it's true -- DBZ has its formula. But as anyone following series knows, you can have good formula and bad formula.
This is good formula. ""Return of Cooler"" (oddly, he's just called ""Coola"" in the subtitles) really should be watched with the preceding movie as a double-header, since Cooler makes his first appearance in that one. He's one of a very, VERY small number of villains to ever manage to fight Goku after having lost one to him.
In this one, Cooler's come back as a cyborg, having fused with a Borg-like supermachine called ""Big Gete Star"" (I prefer the spellings of Gheti or Geti, but c'est la vie) that among other annoying traits allows his now-robotic body to repair itself at lightning speed. Cooler attacks New Namek, the planet the Namek-seijin went to after their original planet was destroyed in the battle between Goku and Freezer.
 (for the uninitiated, yes, the names are that silly. Toriyama-sensei is very fond of puns and in-jokes, and most names in Dragonball/DBZ refer to food, clothing, or appliances in some way)
The Namek-seijin get help when their planet is attacked, in the form of Goku and his friends. This is just fine with Cooler, who was planning on hitting Earth next.
What makes this one better than some of the others is that its battles do not follow the pure formula. There IS one DBZ movie that follows the formula to the letter and remains fun to watch (the next one -- Three Super Saiyajin), but on the whole it's better when there's unexpected twists. In this one Goku simply CANNOT win it alone and does need help, and their enemy is something beyond merely another Badass Warrior.
The movie also gives us a bit more action from the other characters, giving even Kuririn, comic relief though he usually is, a few moments to kick some. Piccolo gets several cool moments, including one that really gives one an appreciation for why he's still sometimes considered to be on the top level of power.
If you're a DBZ fan, this is one of the movies you really should own.
Negative points:
 I've seen this one in letterbox format at least once; why that isn't on the DVD, I don't know.
 The translation in subtitles is... iffy. There aren't very many places where it's flat-out WRONG, but a number where the translated version doesn't get the right spirit or phrasing for what the original meant. (one subtle point which they and other fan-translators muck up is that when Goku first becomes Super-Saiyajin and Cooler comments on it, Cooler HESITATES. His voice makes clear that he's NOT quite as confident as he makes himself out to be, and that should be reflected in the subtitles.)
 It seems rather unfair that the English version gets a super-Dolby and we get Japanese Mono -- I believe this was released in theaters, which makes it hard to believe that there IS no stereo version of the Japanese. I suppose it's possible, of course, in which case there's nothing to be done -- you can't bring back the Japanese cast and re-record it (and even if you wanted to, at least one of the original VA's is dead now).",1029888000,,3057,4.655555555555556

The plot is very organized (save for a rushed start) and the action intense. Surprisingly, I thought that the english dubbed version was worth my money alone. It was the only FUNImation feature that made me laugh at their dialouge. The action, as I said, was intense. All of the fighting scenes were well choreographed and featured both Vegeta and Goku (both super sayjin) facing the same guy. It's my favorite DVD as of yet, and I encourage everyone who likes Dragonball Z to buy this DVD.",1029283200,,592,4.4907407407407405

The intense battle between Meta Cooler (Yes that's spelled right.  This dubbed uses Meta, not Metal) and Vegeta and Goku.  Not many special features, as usual.  There are some voice actor interviews and some profiles of the charicters but that's it.  This is still a great buy, although.  I recommend this to all DBZ fan out there.",1029283200,,491,4.388888888888889

It is pretty good i have seen the japenese version dubbed in english. Also the commercial. This is VEGETA'S FIRST MOVIE movie 6. The next movie VEGETA is in is movie 7. VEGETA is the one who is in this because he has a score to settle with Freiza but takes out on Meta (metal) Cooler.",1027468800,2,406,3.9634146341463414
1711312,4,B000066739,"Although many people consider movie #7 the turning point in the DBZ movies, I personally think that this is where they take off (although they are all great.) It doesn't take place in the normal Dragon Ball universe for Dende is the Earth's Guardian, but Gohan's not even a Super Saiyan yet, but that doesn't take anything away from this one. It has everything that you could want from a DBZ movie--great fight, a cool bad guy, and Vegeta (finally.) The music in this was also pretty good for Dragon Ball Z, but I have to admit that I'm looking forward to FUNimation's soundtrack (but not the dubbing.) My favorite part about the fight is that it's not a Goku gets beat up then suddenly comes back to kill the bad guy in one powerful attack kind of thing, but rather one with the good guy and bad guy running almost even, the good guy one step behind most of the fight and then wins by a thread. All in all, although not nearly the best, this is one DBZ movie that even the wavering fans wouldn't want to miss.",1026864000,11,1010,4.321052631578947

Whew! A great DBZ movie! The best one yet (before #6) Attack! 1,000,000 power warriors is far better than Battle of the Strongest. I haven't seen neither in english though. Great one, check it out.
Summary:
Goku, Master Roshi, Yajorboie, Krillin, Gohan, Picolo, and Oolong are traveling to the new Namek on vacation. When they arrive, the Big Getia Star is *eating* the planet. The nameks have become slaves of Cooler (refered in this movie as Meta Coola)and his many copies. While Cooler's body parts were floating in space, they rebuilt him (so much like the Freezer Saga) So he wants to make Sayia-Jin copies, Sort of Meta Suepr Sayia-Jins. Cooler unleashes alot of robots, they seem to be to tough, blood flies, eyes couge, and people get hurt. They eventually beat the (crud) out of them, and win. Cooler starts to battle Goku, since nobody else stands a chance. Everyone except Picolo, Gohan, and Goku are taken prisoner. Cooler starts whopping Goku's but, and is about to kill him. Vegeta shows up (Note: this is Vegeta's first DBZ movie) and saves Goku's life while he is battling Cooler. Vegeta and Goku go into a huge battle between Cooler, and defeat him (yay! :-)But as they look up a cliff, thousands of Meta Coolers come out. Vegeta and Goku swear themselves silly, and decide to take them on. They end up in a big room with wires around them. The real Cooler (who they couldn't truly rebuild) is a big face in the middle of this huge room. Cooler tells them they are to be sucked of their energy, so he can make Meta Super Sayia-Jins. So, he starts to suck energy, (Note: Picolo battles a Meta Cooler right about now) Goku and Vegeta decide to give them to much power, so it will blow up the system (much like Goku did with Yakon in the Babadi saga) so, everything goes boom. THE END, right? No. The big Cooler face pops up, and his body is made of wires. HE IS HUGE! He battles Goku, Goku whops but, and THEN EVERYTHING GOES BOOM! Including most of the planet. That means, everyone (including the Nameks) are dead! No, Goku uses his instant trancemisson and teleports everyone back to his ship. The movie ends with Goku giving the screen a peace sign.",1025481600,5,2232,4.56857855361596

7961648,2,B000066739,"Dragon Ball Z has it's fair share (maybe a little more than fair) of movies. Some better than others. Before I explain to you why this is in the ""others"" category, I'll start by stating that all of the Dragon Ball films are not canon with the exception of History of Trunks, Battle of Gods and Ressurection of 'F'. So now that we cleared up why this movie isn't canon, let's point out all of the reasons why. To start the whole movie takes place on New Namek, which in the main series nobody knew the location of. If they did then Future Trunks and Gohan would've embarked to the planet in order to use the Namekian Dragon Balls to once again resurrect their dead friends and possibly take down the androids. Secondly it's heavily implied that Piccolo has already fused with Kami which is impossible considering he was one-hit KO'd by Cooler, which means would be weaker than Goku at his base when in turn Piccolo was the strongest Z-Fighter before Goku and Gohan went in the Time Chamber. Also, the placement of this film takes place during the 10 day wait for the Cell Games to begin which begs the question, why hasn't gohan gone Super Saiyan at this point then? And where the hell is Trunks? If vegeta can go Super Saiyan and Piccolo is Fused with Kami then Trunks should be hanging out somewhere. Another thing is how did Vegeta figure out where everyone was? NOBODY KNOWS OR SHOULD KNOW WHERE NEW NAMEK IS.

With all that aside the animation is a little worse for wear. Sure the fight scenes are passable enough and the idle animation is ok but it's noticeable that it's not quite as good as the series' animation is, most notably when examining the animation where Goku recoils from an attack bt Cooler (pictured below.) All in all, I think the best thing this film did was add content in the series and therefore in the video games, but on a production/analytical standpoint I wouldnt recommend.",1448928000,,1903,4.531976744186046
