141369,5,0792837746,"I watched this movie with my mentor group and we had a great time bonding. It is a total ""chick flick"" and it is all about old time love, romance, dance, and feeling good. So much fun! I love it. There is a  character to symbolize each of your crazy chick friends.",915580800,,264,4.076923076923077

141372,5,0792837746,"Shag is one of my favorite movies, and this VHS is just as I remember it! All of the original music!",1394668800,,100,3.8095238095238093
141373,5,0792837746,What a high!  I grew up in NC about two hours from Myrtle Beach so this movie was an absolute delight.,1393113600,,102,3.857142857142857
141374,5,0792837746,great movie for all that were young men and women during the 69s and 70s and knowing how great myrtle beach was and is .it brings back memories for me from the greatest time of my life,1391990400,,184,4.0
141375,5,0792837746,"The Movie came in  good condition. I enjoyed Fonda and Cates vacationing together wow what fun the girl fight, beauty contest, good fun.",1390694400,,136,4.913043478260869
141376,5,0792837746,This movie has no real plot but the dancing and the old Myrtle beach scenes are great! buy it now.,1386979200,,98,3.95
141377,5,0792837746,"Excellent period movie with fun, talented cast.  Wonderful music and shag dancing that few know how to do anymore.  This version of the VHS - the cast riding in the convertible - is as true to the original theatrical release as you can get.  Later versions - two girls faces on the cover - may be better quality but they are altered versions -- some songs are changed.  The movie nicely shows a time sadly long gone.",1381795200,,416,4.363636363636363
141378,5,0792837746,"I have been looking for the original version of this movie for years.  The other version has different music, and for some reason it really bothers me.  I was worried that even though this has the right cover, it would still be the wrong movie.  I'm so happy that I finally have the correct version that I have loved since junior high.  And it is still in pretty good shape for a VHS tape that is over twenty years old!",1379548800,,419,4.2
141379,3,0792837746,The individual copy that I selected was the copy with the photo of the cast in the car on the front cover. I selected it specifically because the reviews rated it with the best soundtrack. I got the copy with the two girls on the front cover. I grew up in that era and still listen to that genre. Little disappointed.,1379548800,,317,4.213114754098361
141380,3,0792837746,Shag movie was the one I was looking for it was grate. The DVD was what the problem was it skipped parts and some parts were missing.,1377993600,,133,3.962962962962963
141381,4,0792837746,"This was a replacement movie for one that was borrowed, then damaged. Since this movie was released in at least two different editions (edits) we were glad to find the same (earlier) versions!",1375660800,,192,4.848484848484849
141382,4,0792837746,I had bought this for my husband.  He grew up in the era this movie was made.  He  liked it very much.,1372723200,,102,3.5454545454545454
141383,1,0792837746,I love this movie. I ordered the VHS .the color was terrible some parts was like looking at a negative. I am very disappointed with this product.,1371772800,,145,4.407407407407407
141384,5,0792837746,"I got the video because a friend of mine from college in North Carolina showed it to me when I was visiting her. My sister also went to college in NC so I got the video to show her when she came to visit. I watched it again with my 22 year old daughter and we both had a fun time watching it.

It's just pure fun for girls and especially for North Carolina girls! It is the Southern version of the Sandra Dee California Beach movies.  A bit too mature for anyone 13 and under due to suggestive situations.  Also great to see Tyrone Power Jr. I loved his father in the classics and was so shocked to see the name pop up in the credits. Although he was born after his Dad passed away he'd never be able to deny the resemblance. It was just a good old fashioned fun time!",1369785600,,768,4.006535947712418
141385,5,0792837746,"Was glad to find this movie on DVD.  It is almost impossible to find any more, thus the high price.  Was worth it, tho.",1359504000,,119,3.9166666666666665
141386,5,0792837746,"This movie is one of my favorites from when I was a teenager.  Like many others, I really do not like the alternate release from MGM.  I see alot of people who don't know how to tell the difference.  If your movie opens with the song ""Mama Says There Will Be Days Like This"" you have the alternate version from MGM.  The original version is Tommy Page singing ""Shag"" and would could forget when the girls take off to Myrtle Beach along with the song ""Saved"" I used to smoke! I used to drink!

You will enjoy this movie no matter what though and it really is ""The Most Fun!""",1327449600,,573,4.172727272727273
141387,1,0792837746,Don't buy Shag on DVD.  You will be very disappointed.  Buy it on VHS because that is the original one. The person that remastered it to DVD did a lousy job by replacing the original songs with horrible ones that I never heard of. It made the movie uninteresting.,1227916800,4,263,4.346938775510204
141388,5,0792837746,"I'm very satisfied with my purchase, the video was in perfect condition inside and out.",1227484800,,87,4.866666666666666
141389,4,0792837746,This item arrived quickly and in good condition.  This is a good-time movie.  The music (on the VHS version) is great.,1213574400,,118,4.571428571428571
141390,5,0792837746,"Be careful to get the correct version (the one w/ the characters riding in a car) of the VCR tape so that you get the period music by the original artists. The DVD doesn't have the original artists, either. Also be careful whom you buy from. The copy of the version that I did want (bought separately) had huge amounts of static, & the seller was very rude about it.
At the end, the song that is sung is the old (pre-integration) song of Spartanburg High School. My late sister was killed during her senior year ('66, she died in a car wreck in Nov. of '65)& I hadn't heard that song since. I cried. It was a different song by the time that I was there, '78. Everyone who went to SHS before '70 should have this movie, if only for that.
I enjoyed it very much, especially being as a bit of my hometown of Spartanburg was in it, & of course, we all went to Myrtle Beach in my time as well. You might be interested to know that The Pavillion, featured in the movie, was torn down a few years ago. The land remains vacant. It was well maintained (but the city wanted to have beach-front condos made), but the deal fell through. I will never go there again because of that.
The plot was very true-to-life of the era. Although I was only 4 when the movie was supposed to have taken place, my sister's friends have verified the details for me.
It was also great to see those actors at that point in their careers.
If you love east coast beach music, get it for that alone, but the story was also good. A movie that I'm delighted was made.",1209254400,6,1532,4.179054054054054
141391,5,0792837746,"Lovely Lovely Lovely movie.....much lovelier if you learn to Shag holding on to Grandma's frig., seems there as been a little to many lessons given out. The bewilderment is my son and I lived here in 84,85,and part of 86. My son was 16y/o and worked at the old roller coaster, and a part of the movie shot there I was sitting on a bench, with a lady and her baby. My son can pretty well nick the point and time where Phoebe Cates is with Buzz on a ride. I do not understand why they are saying the movie was shot in 89. This will drive me crazy!!!! Don't never ever stop watching Shag!",1107648000,2,585,4.095652173913043
141392,5,0792837746,"This movie has got to be the best movie (along with Gone With the Wind) ever!  I have actually worn out my VHS tape because my girlfriends and I (all from South Carolina) get together to watch it at least once a week!  I went to Senior Week (as Sun Fun weekend is known to graduating seniors from SC) four years ago, as did every graduating senior in SC, as did our parents before us.  My mom loves to watch it because it reminds her of her Senior Week (in 1963)!  Those who don't like it, are usually guys or those who don't know what shagging is or how to do it (people not from SC or the South, basically).  So give it a chance, don't just rent it, you have to buy it!",1085356800,4,671,3.9776119402985075
141393,4,0792837746,"ok the movie was just like every spring break movie you had ever seen even the characters were the same the prim one, the slut, the one that used to be a duckling and became a swan, they all go to the beach to have one last fling before they go their own ways.the movie wasn't bad it just wasn't all that memorable. but all throughout the movie i kep screaming how much i loved chip (scott coffey) his character was so lovable. i wish i could find more movies he was in.",1057795200,2,470,4.064516129032258
141394,5,0792837746,"This is an ausome movie...
It's actually my favorite movie. I use to drive my mom insane watching it every chance I got. It's a shame it didn't do to well cause of a stupid title... but like they say you cant judge a book by its cover... well you cant with movies either, or else your missin out! I highly reccomend this movie and it should be sold in stores!! hint hint.",1057104000,,371,4.095890410958904
141395,5,0792837746,"I absolutely love this movie!  It's about 4 girls sneaking away to go to Myrtle Beach, SC for a wild weekend together!",1049068800,,118,4.363636363636363
141396,5,0792837746,"when i first saw this film i was about 12 and it was so cool, i couldn't wait to get home from school so that i could watch it. the first time i saw it i wanted to look just like bridget fonda and several times tried to do the dance she does! after watching it a few times i realised that i wanted to be like pudge,her romance with chip is the cutest thing ever.this is a must see movie for any slumber party.
love it to bits",1004572800,,425,3.7865168539325844
141397,4,0792837746,"Shag The Movie. I love this movie. I have watched it since I was like 10 years old. It's about four just graduated best friends who go on a wild last weekend together to Myrtle Beach. These four friends are so close but so different from each other. One is the soon to be married Carson. Malaina is the rebelious preachers daughter. Pudge is the girl who has plenty of boy friends but no boyfriend, and Luann is the very conservative Senators daughter. These girls start their weekend thinking that they know where they are heading in life, but those couple of days put them all on different paths to different directons. No matter what they will always be just as close as when it all started. This is a fun movie. It shows about friendship, first loves, new love, disappointment and anticipation. It is a good movie for teens, especially girls. Buy this one to have handy at all your future slumber parties.",1004486400,,909,4.548780487804878
141398,5,0792837746,"This is one of the cheesiest, best movies ever made. I'm not ashamed to say that much of my early teen/high school years were taken up with this film. The story never grows old, and the characters never grow tiresome. A must for every collection, even if you only pull it out once every few years.",999043200,,297,4.321428571428571
141399,3,0792837746,When they filmed this movie I can say I was in it! Although WAYYYYYY in the back in the big crowed shot on the strip. And you never see me but it was a blast. Other than my 1 second of NO FAME. The movie I thought was less than fair. I guess I need to watch it again to get a more adult view of the film. Hummmm might run out and get it now!,975196800,,341,3.5
141400,3,0792837746,"Nothing spectacular here. There are some nice dance numbers. You get to see Tyrone Power, Jr. who looks like his father, and you get Annabeth Gish who is radiant. Bridget Fonda is also on tap. The movie has a weak script, but the energetic cast makes up for the plot weaknesses.",972172800,,278,4.470588235294118
141401,5,0792837746,"This is a great movie  it is funny and cute and has great cast, it took me forever to find this video for so cheap cause it was out of print for so long,  but i found it and i bought it it is a must have!",971049600,,204,3.3191489361702127
141402,4,0792837746,"I just loved this movie. I would do anything to go back in time and be able to go shagging at Myrtle Beach, and date Chip,..ha ha ha!  If someone knows how to buy this movie please help me I want to have it desperatly.",952041600,,218,3.8444444444444446
141403,4,0792837746,"For anybody who loves to reminisce about best girlfriends, teenage summers, and first loves this is the movie to see! As a bonus, it's got a great soundtrack of beach music from the 60's. You'll laugh and cry and  watch it again and again! Trust me, ""It's the most fun!""",951696000,2,270,4.4
141404,5,0792837746,"The movie shag is funny, romantic, and fun filled. I have literally seen it at least 75 times. It is my all time favorite movie, and I reccomend it for people 11 and older. It takes place in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.  It's about four young women who are best friends and decide to take their  last vacation together before college. While they're there they discover  their inner selves and along the way run into romance, and challenges. And  it is deffinately worth watching.",946771200,11,480,4.678571428571429
141405,4,0792837746,"I have the original movie because I always scour used book/video stores!  It is no longer for sale, but I suggest you go to great lengths to find it!  I will probably buy this version; but I can tell you, if the music has  been changed, I will be disappointed.  I'm just so afraid my VCR will eat  my original Shag!  This movie is extremely endearing.  At times, I think I  relate to one of the characters, and then I see myself in another.  My  favorite quote is by Harley when he is addressing the housekeeper who has  come to open up the beach house ""Are you......fuzzy?""  Ha!",941155200,,579,4.2592592592592595

7792124,5,0792837746,I adore this movie.. When the movie came in I ran and put it in my dvd/vcr combo.. Got the picture for the movie but no sound.. My husband fittled around with it changing cords and still nothing.. I've been waiting so long to receive this movie.. As its not available at a reasonable price on dvd.

7792126,1,0792837746,YUCK MGM what did you do? You altered my beloved movie! This rating is for the version of the movie. The movie is still great it's the same movie but the songs that went along with it are not there. It made it unbearable to watch. You have to get the VHS copy that has them sitting in the car on the cover. if you saw it back in the day like I did I went to the movies to see this that is the version you'll remember.,1427155200,3,417,3.75
