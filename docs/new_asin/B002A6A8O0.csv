8358996,4,B002A6A8O0,"I viewed this series on our local educational tv station. Overall it was quiet good. The series of books were near the top of my list as a child. I recently reread the books as an adult and still found them to be quiet good. I will probably buy this series if the price drops. As for Keely, you can watch this movie on your computer, I buy lots of region 2 movies and either watch them on my pc or rip and reburn them region free using free internet software ( dvd decrypter, shrink , rip it for me ). I would hope to see a big budget remake of these movies some day. If you are a young sci fi fan ( or just love good sci fi) this is one of the best series of books about alien invasion and rule that you will find (The White Mountions, City of gold and lead, Pool of Fire.)It is also a great coming of age and just plain adventure and survival story. I've also read The coming of the tripods novel,its nice to have to compleate the set but seems hastefully written and fails to capture the vibe and feel of the other three John Christopher books. I believe it to have been written after the first three in responce to fans. Also region free dvd players are available on amazon for a resonable price.",1272585600,4,1200,4.088983050847458
8358997,4,B002A6A8O0,"I have been actively looking for a US format (region 1) edition of this series for the past year with out much luck. If anyone has any suggestions, or ideas as to where I can find this, it would be much appreciated!",1261872000,5,215,4.142857142857143
8358998,5,B002A6A8O0,"I just purchased this set for only $31.00 U.S. upon Amazon.co.uk.
Why these sellers are asking so much for a readily available title
sure mystifies me. This is the best BBC series, in my opinion.",1248480000,6,195,4.6
