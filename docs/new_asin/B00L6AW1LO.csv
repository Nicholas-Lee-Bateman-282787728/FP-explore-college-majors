6472769,3,B00L6AW1LO,"I think I'd give this movie a 3.5 instead of a 3.  I guess I could have rounded up but I just didn't want to give the impression that it was that great.  Don't get me wrong.  All the actors did a fantastic job in their roles and as far as the quality of movie,...it's definitely there!  My complaint with this movie was it was just a bit confusing with all the different parties involved.  It just seemed as if they were trying too hard to make the story more complicated then it needed to be.  James Franco was great in this movie (as he always is) and Kate Hudson was equally as good.

Tom and Anna (Franco and Hudson) are a struggling couple that relocated to London to start over following a miscarriage.  Their late grandmother left them a house, and while attempting to renovate, they have gone further and further into dept.  When Tom gets served an eviction notice, he believes all hope is lost.  However, after discovering the dead body of their downstairs tenant, they also come across the treasure trove of goods he has hidden away.  Thinking it's going to solve their financial problems, they stash the money.  Only to discover there are 2 other parties that are looking for the loot as well.

It's really got all the making for a great suspense film.  I mean, who hasn't dreamed of finding a bag of money?!  Regardless, I felt the studio just didn't do enough with the talent they were given.

Final Verdict:  Give it a shot.  I definitely don't regret watching it, but I prefer Franco as a bad guy in, Homefront.  This was a one time only  viewing for me.",1412035200,6,1569,4.419580419580419

This is the description given. It is very concise and to the point. Why did I like this so much? The performances and the story were very good. Do others who have reviewed this and given it much less have some points, yes, they do. It does get pretty slow at times. This is a vey paced movie and to me this is how it needs to be. Are James and Kate dumb? they do some really stupid things for sure but we have to think they are the ""everyman"" and don't know how to be criminal or hide it.

6472782,3,B00L6AW1LO,"Good People (2014) is the type of movie where you can you watch the last 15 minutes of the film and not miss anything special.  It is basically a copy-cat of Ca$h (2010) starting Sean Bean as the menacing gangster from England.  In Good People, James Franco and Kate Hudson play an American couple living in what I believe London, England.  One day, they discover their co-tenant dead and a bag of money hidden in the celling.  As the criminal investigation in the death of their tenant ensues, different characters enter the picture, namely: a violent gangster who will stop at nothing to get his ""heist gone-wrong"" money back while at the same time avenge the death of his younger brother (the Witkowski brothers)---there is also, the gentleman-like African-French heroin exporter who is seeking his stolen stash of money, and an older and experienced detective, with a personal vendetta, who is trying to crack the case.

I felt like the movie was rushed and there is not much character development here. No suspense whatsoever, except for the last 15 minutes of the film.  The movie also lacks in good soundtrack score.",1430697600,,1123,4.853403141361256

6472785,3,B00L6AW1LO,"Good People is a pretty dull slow movie for the most part where our American couple who have inherited a house in London and are struggling to survive financially (why not just sell the house?) notice a bit of an odour coming from the basement of their rental flat that they've subleased to help pay those bills that they can't on their own.  (Opening scenes spoilers) Their flatmate has overdosed so although the police know this is guy is part of the underworld and you know maybe they might find something to help convict past crimes or prevent future ones, they don't do much of a search for his stash, if at all.  Of course our American couple (Franco and Hudson) do, and come up with the ingenious plan of hiding it in their oven.  Even though the bad guys slash couches, and rip up the place they never think about opening the oven door, so decide to get real violent to get it back!  Of course the rival underworld drug entrepreneurs who the money was stolen from in the first place by the group the tenant was involved with, also want it and their liquid heroin back.  Luckily a cop happens to be on scene to give them a bit of time after their first meeting with the first bad guys, but whose side is he on?

Franco and Hudson did make a believable couple their characters just weren't the brightest and were kind of dull people.  The villains were a bit more interesting, especially Omar Sy's Khan, although he doesn't have much time on film.  The ending although taking the movie to an even more implausible level, at least made the film a lot more fun to watch.",1427500800,,1574,4.403448275862069

6472790,2,B00L6AW1LO,"Lifeless thriller about an American couple living in London who are underwater financially--they are trying to renovate a family home left to James Franco's character but can't pay the mortgage and also got an eviction notice on the apartment where they are currently living.  Then they find the tenant living in their basement has died and, after the body was taken away and they are boxing up his things they find a suitcase full of money hidden in the ceiling tiles.  As is always the case in this type of scenario the couple start spending the money and then the criminals it belongs to turn up and want it back--really, really badly.

The fact that anyone who watches movies has likely seen scenarios similar to this many times before isn't really the biggest problem with Good People--it's a set-up that tends to work because it's easy to identify with the protagonist--if you found a suitcase full of cash you would likely know that keeping it might be a very bad idea but that might not be enough to actually get you to turn it in.  This is the fantasy of a moral decision that has life changing implications--all your bills paid off, the money for a nicer home or that car you could never afford--as long as you can keep the money without getting caught.

It's a scenario that's worked many times in films of varying quality from No Country For Old Men to A Simple Plan to Shallow Grave, all of which are well-liked films in which the protagonists find a suitcase full of money that they decide to keep, which turns out to be a predictably bad idea.  On the other end of the quality scale Australian B movie director Craig Lahiff used that set-up for two separate movies--Fever in 1988 and the much more recent Swerve in 2011.  It's a set-up that has worked before many times and will work again but the listless Good People offers one of the dullest, most perfunctory takes that you are ever likely to see.

Kate Hudson hasn't been interesting in a movie since Almost Famous but James Franco is a far more capable actor--unfortunately in Good People he simply phones it in, bringing none of the sly humor or eccentric choices that he is capable of when engaged by the material--if you watch this and Homefront or Spring Breakers back to back it's scarcely believable that the James Franco in Good People is the same actor as in the other two.  The talented Tom Wilkinson also seems to have decided that this movie wasn't worth the effort and gives a paycheck collecting performance as dull as Franco's.

To be fair to both actors Good People is directed with so little urgency or style the flat performances may not even be their fault.  Good People moves very slowly and never generates the slightest amount of tension--there's no suspense, almost no action, just the dull inevitability of a showdown between the one-dimensional hoods and even less interesting heroes.

The finale between the couple and rival hoods that lay claim to the money involves a friend and her baby and eventually the cop and takes place in the couple's unsafe non-renovated home--the climactic sequence is busy but so poorly staged it never generates the kicks that it could have--but on the plus side it's less boring than the rest of the film if only because the director has several things to cut between.

In the end Good People is dull but relatively watchable, for something starring Kate Hudson it might even qualify as above average.  If it were playing on television late at night Good People might catch your attention enough that you wouldn't change the channel but it's not worth the price of a rental.",1423612800,3,3602,4.669826224328594

6472797,3,B00L6AW1LO,"I saw this movie 4 years ago when it was called Ca$h, but that was a comedy and this was a thriller, still it's amazing just how similar the two films are. Good People and Ca$h are so much alike, that I don't know how the producers of this film didn't get sued! Good People takes place in London and focuses on another young couple down on their luck. They're about to lose everything when their downstairs tenet dies and they find a bag of cash in the ceiling. Much like the couple in Ca$h, they face the dilemma of keeping the money or turning it into the police. Of course they have to keep the money for there to be a film, but shortly after, the rightful owners show up and want their cash, leaving the couple on the run. James Franco and Kate Hudson play the young couple and to my surprise, despite their very different styles, they had great chemistry, but that's really all this film had. It's very hard to review a film that is so similar to another, because I find myself unimpressed by the second film and wonder, if I hadn't seen the first, would I have enjoyed the second? As far as thrillers go, it wasn't much different or better than you'd expect it to be, despite the big names in the cast. Ultimately, Good People isn't a bad film, but I preferred the story in a more comedic form with Sean Bean playing a foul mouthed, wise cracking gangster. If you're a fan of any of the cast members, you should see this film, because it definitely wasn't boring, but it really wasn't anything special.",1422835200,,1508,4.332155477031802

6472802,1,B00L6AW1LO,"A few viewers might be enticed to see this thriller due to its solid cast: James Franco, Kate Hudson and the inevitable Tom Wilkinson star in this hyper-formulaic thriller.  There have been so many films based on plots about nave rubes encountering dirty money that they deserve to be classified as their own sub-genre.  As always, the nave couple is confronted by criminals who want their money back.  This by-the-numbers plot is actually based on a novel.

As in any contemporary thriller, there are resurrections galore; despite being stabbed, clubbed, shot, and stapled, the protagonists and antagonists bounce back for more.  Predictably, the pacifist couple rely on ingenious weapons to counter the well-armed thugs.  Since their home is half-renovated, it is full of dangerous construction materials to exploit.  What would screenwriters do these days without staple or nail guns?  Therein lies the hilarity; these preposterous clashes give the film an uncanny ""Home Alone"" atmosphere.  One can almost expect the narcissistic chief thug, Khan, to resemble an enraged Joe Pesci after awhile.

And Khan?  Khan?  The thug likens himself to Genghis Khan, but the simian screenwriters probably thought of Star Trek's Khan Noonian Singh instead.  James Franco's anguished cry: ""Khaaaaaaaaaaaan!""  was apparently edited out.

Bereft of the money pit that put them in their situation, the childless couple does receive compensation.  It seems that shootings, stabbings, and a brisk tumble down a staircase is just what the doctor ordered to get Kate Hudson's character ovulating.  I do hope that this film doesn't inspire other couples to use similar methods.

One day, an enterprising film distributor might package this picture with ""Home Alone"" and really have something.  Hey, you never know.",1421107200,2,1795,5.369175627240144

This movie has a little something for everyone, suspense, action and family situations. No Nudity and very little bad language if any. This is a good movie about good people that get caught in a bad life situation and the choices they make to try and get out. There is an old phrase that best describes this film.

The films starts that way with it's well-known cast, London setting, and intriguing premise: what if a hard-luck couple discovers a stash of money left behind by their drug-dealing tenant?

6472823,3,B00L6AW1LO,"Based on a novel by Marcus Sakey, adapted for the screen by Kelly Masterson and directed by Henrik Ruben Genz, GOOD PEOPLE just doesn't make it. And that is sad as it has two very fine actors (James Franco and Tom Wilkinson) and a beautiful actress (Kate Hudson). But the story is lame and predictable and not very interesting - an American couple, childless, moves to London when the husband's relative dies and leaves him her home. They live on very little and finally find funds when a renter dies and a half million dollars falls into their hands.  Of course not telling the police about it leads to problems and a boring 90 minutes later they ultimately get some of the stolen money courtesy of the detective they lied to and also find out they are finally pregnant.

To grim a story for Hallmark but in every other way this trite film tries to have a moral. Too bad Franco and Wilkinson agreed to add this to their resume. It is pretty sad.  Grady Harp, November 14",1417305600,2,971,4.443820224719101

He is about to lose the house as he is in debt. Their tenant dies. They find a lot of money. Mean people beat them up repeatedly to get the money back. Corrupt police won't help.

The movie really has no plot. There is no moral dilemma. There is no tension. I don't eve think these people are ""good people"". I think they have just kept their noses clean because they have not been challenged--they have not been tempted yet--they have no lives. Anyway, there is a lot of violence. Graphic violence. From start to finish. The movie is set in a seedy part of London. Perhaps it is today's London. Dunno. Just lots of dilapidated buildings, graffiti, dirt, weeds, death, etc. Gloomy i s the word. By the end I was not rooting for the couple. I was not interested in how they got out of their mess or even if they did. I just turned it off before it ended. It was just gore. Also, the gore was kinda done in a casual way. I mean who is standing face to face with someone and then exclaims ""WTF"" when the someone stabs them in the stomach? That is the reaction some people have when they cashier gives you attitude, not when you get your guts ripped out. There is lots of blood. Umm . . . what else? Brains? Yeah some guy gets shot in the head in front a car. YOu see it happening from inside the car. There is brain matter and blood all over the windshield. What do the other bad guys do? Just get in the car and turn the wipers on. It is just casual. Weird. Icky. Not entertainment.

I will say that while most people in this movie look gross--like they have not bathed in a while--let along taken care of their teeth, hair, skin, etc, James Franco for once in my life looks washed. He looks like he has been to the dentist. He doesn't look like he just has surgery and had that antiseptic stuff that they wash all over you that turns your skin orange. Even his hair looks combed.

6472854,3,B00L6AW1LO,"Its a rather known fact that concerning the adaptation of novels to film the book is always better. I'm an enthusiast of crime fiction and a blurb on Marcus Sakey's Good People from Dennis Lehane drew me to read the book outside of the rather generic nature of the plot. Sakey's writing and characters were enough to overcome the used idea of a group of financially troubled people coming into a pile of money due to a sudden death, and the ending added a bit of pathos to the main characters questioning their ability to be considered Good People.
Cut to years later when I caught a trailer for the film and was surprised to find the action of the novel moved from Chicago to London. But a movie whatever its faults should always stand on its own and liking previous movies from Henrik Reuben Ganz and writer Kelley Matterson I was hoping for an interesting adaptation. An adaptation I got though if it was interesting remains to be seen.
As it goes as the movie opens a group of criminals rip off a French drug dealer, stealing not only his case of liquid heroin but 350,000 pounds as well. Before they can get away with their ill gotten loot a member of the gang kills the leaders brother and makes off with the drugs and money. Cut to weeks later and the same criminal has overdosed in the basement apartment of financially troubled couple Tom and Anna Wright which puts them in sight of not only the thieves but the drug dealer himself, while being aided by a shady policeman who's motives might not be entirely positive as well.
The film while not being great does have some positives. Tom Wilkinson is always a positive presence in a film and He makes a thankless role interesting in a few scenes with his wife, or the younger boss who of course is pushing for him to retire.  Omar Sy's Khan is an invention of the movie and isn't really drawn well as character but the actor has a presence that makes him intimidating in a quiet way. And Sam Spruell as Jack Witkowsky does make for a good villain.
The direction by Ganz is also great for the most part building a decent amount of suspense especially from a rather trite ending that is too reminiscent of Skyfall or Straw Dogs.
Where the film falters for me are two areas: its leads, and the changes to the finale. I have nothing against James Franco and Kate Hudson's career choices or even their performances but they just don't seem to gel as a couple in the film however much they do cute couple things and that makes the actions they're put through by the script really uninteresting however much they're tortured by the more interesting villains. And to harp on Matterson's script a bit is a change in the ending that sucks out what made the book intriguing. Sure their must have been quiet a few changes necessary for various reasons but replacing the books more tragic bit of circumstance with an action sequence involving characters sneaking through a rotten booby trapped house is bit a let down and turns the movie into an action film over an interesting thriller.
In the end that's what your left with as a viewer. The story is alright, but rather generic. The villains are more interesting than the heroes, And the only bit of interest the film has in its characters is a supporting character who doesn't get much screen time. The movies watchable, but the book was much more interesting.",1415145600,,3358,4.532125205930807

6472859,2,B00L6AW1LO,"Emily Blunt over at BluntReview.com says : Mah. Looking at the cast, you'll wanna jump in. But, it's the old switch-a-roo. Tom Wilkinson used to be a trusted source, as did Franco...Hudson was at least a fun bet. Not here kids. Good People is so telegraphed you can here Marconi-like bleeps as the next scene, that has you yelling towards the widescreen, ""Really? Really? Oh, I didn't see that coming at all."" For an idea of what this is about...mash Duplex, with a pinch of Pacific Heights (sans diabolical renter), and stir in Home Alone rated R (as there's a lot of unkid-like violence to be sitting through - and most of the film is in the home-based location).

Good People coulda worked. Well, maybe. I mean when was the last time a anyone down on their financial luck found a bucket-o-cash, decided they'd wait (here an extremely short time) to spend, stay where they found said monies (<- in case anyone, say, wanted it - badly enough to hunt them down; again where they'd first look for the money), and it worked out just fine? That's never - probably even in real life. From which this strays so far off it's core of thought, you'll be thankful there's some extra features to ease the purchase blow.

The upside (and I am being gracious here) is it's about as cheesy as you can get; and sometimes, when you're in the mood, a blatantly mind-numbing, no need for brain usage, movie is what the Dr. ordered. A Mystery Science contender sort...with a higher budget then most of their fare.",1414368000,,1495,4.574626865671642
6472860,2,B00L6AW1LO,"""Whenever you find a pot of gold there's always a monster guarding it."" Tom (Franco) and Anna (Hudson) are married and struggling. They are weeks away from losing their house and the job market is dry. They are cleaning up an apartment of one of their tenants who died they find a huge bag of cash. After going back and forth on what to do with the bag they decide to just take what they need to keep the house for another month. Little by little they begin to take more but then someone comes looking for the money. Keep in mind when you read this that I watch every movie we order for the store. There are at least 2 movies a month that come out with the exact idea. The only difference this one has is that big name actors are in this. People find a bag of money with like $1 million in it and think what should we do...we will only spend a little of it to help us out. Soon most of the money is gone then they act shocked when someone comes looking for it. I have always wondered if a bad movie can be made good by adding great actors. According to this movie the answer is no. This is still a b-rate overdone movie with better acting. Overall, a movie that has been done so many times that nothing can help the repetition of the plot. I give this a C+.",1414368000,,1257,4.052208835341365

I never could stand Kate Hudson and never understood why she is put in everything but she does okay in this film.

8664003,4,B00L6AW1LO,"I liked the movie. It takes place in England. Tom and Anna are just two people trying to make ends meet & Anna is trying to get pregnant. Tragedy strikes this couple when a tenant of theirs is found dead in the basement apartment he was renting from Tom & Anna. Tom finds some money in the basement apartment and takes it. Tom & Anna are basically good people, but within all of us there lies evil and Tom uses some of the money to bail himself out. Of course the money was stolen in a drug war and both sides take it out on Tom & Anna. The police suspect Tom & Anna and confront them and eventually get Tom to surrender the money. This is where the fun begins. A deal is made whereby Tom & Anna will deliver the money to one of the parties and all hell breaks loose. The policeman is shot and Tom & Anna are on the run. Eventually one of the drug members kidnaps Anna's god-daughter & mother and a deal is made to bring the money to a house that Tom inherited from his grandmother & got into debt renovating it. It's an action, crime and thriller all wrapped into one.

About the only thing I did not like was that many of the scenes are portrayed in the ""dark"" and unless you're watching it on a Home Theater screen in a dark room, all you'll be able to hear is the dialog (that's why I took 1 star off of what other wise would have been a 5 star review)",1485907200,,1356,4.022222222222222
