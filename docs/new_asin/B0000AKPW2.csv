7997499,3,B0000AKPW2,"This production is rather quaint. I don't know if it is Rossini or the conductor but while it is quite beautiful it doesn't have much drive. The production is rather traditional. At times you feel you are watching something Rossini himself would recognize. The colors are vibrant and it all looks rather Roman even though it is supposed to take place in the 11th century. The singers are all unknown. They do not have big voices, but in this opera that is all right. They do produce some beautiful sounds. The acting is clunky but that too adds to the charm. The sound is misleading. Although it claims to be Dolby 5.1 it does not register so on my system. I think it is really just stereo - but it is decent sound nonetheless.",1105056000,12,727,4.432835820895522
