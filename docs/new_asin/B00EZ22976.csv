The more it got into it the more the episodes seem to get off the point in ways. I mean like the characters are built up some what and then all of a sudden the change. Like apparently the assistant can actually talk in one episode... then he dispappers after a while. Some of the episodes are not very clear on what is going on. the story line was all over the place. I mean what exactly are faries and where did they come from whats their story.  I mean you know they have to have fun in order to multiply. That they have a weird way of thinking.

Then you have characters that just pop in and out of the show without a real reason who they are except for these robots. Just its funny and all but very confusing for some people",1453161600,,831,4.0

8610508,2,B00EZ22976,"I had high hopes after the first episode. It had a true moment of greatness, a scene that left me howling with laughter that left me wanting more. The series became less and less funny, and by the time I got to the last episode I was glad to be done with it.",1399852800,,258,3.8867924528301887
8610509,5,B00EZ22976,"I am not one for laughing at loud at something, but the pilot episode gave me a wicked smirk and chuckle. The second episode literally made me roll with laughter and I had to pause it because I was crying so joyfully.

This is an extremely clever show, and I don't feel it's gender-biased. Anyone can enjoy this, as it is such a beautiful slice of life comedy without any romance or harsh drama.

A full one-cour with OVAs, this is worth every penny. One of the best animes of its genre to grace our screens. The only tiff I have with this is the lack of creativity in the BD menu design. My grandma could have made a better one with iDVD.

Other than that though, buy this anime and pray for another season.",1392681600,6,708,4.229629629629629
8610510,5,B00EZ22976,"In ways, this show defies description, and that's probably deliberate. It doesn't fit into any neat genre niche. I don't think it's possible to discuss this show without spoilers, so I'll try to keep them to a minimum, so just be careful...

A few random adjectives come to mind: surreal, satirical and absurd. The art work blatantly contrasts with the premise. The art showing a colorful world populated by laughing fairies, befriended by a cute girl wearing clothing reminiscent of Bavarian milkmaids. Oh and all this in a post-apocalyptic world, after society has collapsed and humanity is on the wane.

That's just the tip of the iceberg. When you see these fairies talking about starving to death, while wearing their perpetual grins, the humor should start to become apparent. It's a dark and biting humor, but does not resort to any sort of gory imagery. Well, unless you count plucked and skinned chickens who throw themselves over a cliff, while set to the tune of ""Ave Maria"", as gory...

There's lots of other things I could say, but I'll just leave it there. If you like things like Eraserhead (not the dark and grim and sometimes disgusting visuals, but rather the entire mind-twist), you'd probably like this.",1387929600,5,1223,4.898550724637682
8610511,5,B00EZ22976,"Humanity is in decline. Currently the most prosperous species are ""Fairies"", 10 cm tall creatures with high intelligence and a great love for sweets. The Mediator's job is to act as an arbitrator between the humans and the fairies. Which basically means that she is often swept up in their insane schemes. With the power of the fairies, entire cities are built, then destroyed, over the course of a few days. Mysterious food factories appear on the edge of town. Robotic bread commits suicide. Humans become characters in manga. Time loops. Sweets. Insanity. And dark humor.

I heard good things about this series, so I had some hopes for it. I found the first 2 episodes to be rather interesting, but I couldn't tell if I liked the series or not. It took me a few more episodes to finally grasp the humor and come to love the show. The first arc is still my least favorite, but I enjoyed it better the second time around. Yes, I liked this series so much by the end, that I re-watched it with my sister just days after finishing it the first time. (And then again a third time some months later).

The humor is both dark and dry, with the Mediator running a witty narrative in her head. The fairies are both adorable and terrifying. I loved them.

Finally, I recommend starting the series with episode 10 and then going back to the beginning. 10 is a stand alone episode that is very funny and a great intro to the series. It is also first chronologically (the series runs mostly backwards in time, though that doesn't really matter).

I saw this series streaming on Crunchyroll, but I intend to buy the DVDs, just as soon as I confirm that I haven't received them as a Christmas present :)

Bonus Feature Note: One on of the discs (I can't remember which, but not the first one), has a set of shorts (I think it was call Survival of the Fittest), that combined equal about one extra episode (and they share the same storyline, so it feels like an episode that was just broken up).",1378252800,31,1982,4.464088397790055
