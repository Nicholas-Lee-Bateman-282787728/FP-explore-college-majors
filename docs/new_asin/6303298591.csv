7842759,4,6303298591,"I had seen this documentary on television a while back and found it very interesting. I'm glad to see this updated version of it, and was also glad to have it arrived on DVD.",1356048000,,174,4.147058823529412
7842760,4,6303298591,"This is a good video, very informative. It compares favorably with, for instance, National Geographic and Reader's Digest videos. The computer recreates of the ancient structures are good. I reckon though that they are shown too quickly. When superimposed on the modern grounds, you can see it's artificial because the lighting is wrong. It would be nice if all ancient structures that can be restored and rebuilt are done so.
The video should have included the modern lighting of the olympic flame ceremony.
The video could have had normal color footage, instead of that faded black and white footage for the ancient scene recreates.
At the end of the other video about Egypt, it says that there is a lot known, and unknown, about ancient Egypt. It would also apply to ancient Greece (and so on).
This series of 3 should also be available on DVD.",1092268800,2,847,4.808219178082192
7842761,4,6303298591,"This video is a bit over an hour long. It has some drama when presenting the different cities and the myths associted with them, but it is highly entertaining. They are able to show what we know as monuments in thier ancient ""glory"" through computer enhancement. It was fascinating to see that ancient Greece was not built in white (as the relics are today) but in vivid colors.
Does not iclude Greek Islands (I was dissapointed that Ithaka, Krete, etc were left out). Does include Corinth.",982800000,19,490,4.709302325581396
