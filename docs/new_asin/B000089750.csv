8243709,1,B000089750,"A recent e-mail exchange I had with Image Entertainment:

MY MESSAGE:

Many on-line DVD vendors (including Amazon) have been listing a series called ""Rock Masters"" from your studio for some time now, with confusing information as to release dates. Some of the titles include The Cure, AC/DC, and The Police, and the listings include such details as the song titles. Can you confirm that you have plans to release these DVDs in the future, or can you provide any information at all about these releases?

THEIR RESPONSE:

Thank you for your inquiry. At this point in time Image Entertainment does not have any plans regarding the release of any titles from the ""Rock Masters"" series on DVD. However, I will pass your email onto our acquisitions department which will look into the possibility of releasing these titles on DVD at some point in the future.

Thank you.",1118102400,5,865,4.857142857142857

Hey, I even went out to Vegas to see him at the Hard Rock Hotel (the Joint) to see him perform in a SMALL VENUE for the first time in 25 years.  It was worth the investment.  I have a question.  Why advertise a DVD that won't be available for 7 years.  Hell, I might not be around, but thank God my kids appreciate early BJ.  Jon Gongwer, Ashland, Ohio",1066953600,7,595,4.086206896551724
8243712,5,B000089750,"This is the earliest Billy Joel concert released on VHS or DVD!!!  It was recorded on the BBC on March 14th, 1978 (just 3 days before I was born)...  It will be released to the world, 25 years after it was recorded.  Now, people have a chance to watch a Billy Joel concert that was performed over 25 years ago.  Seeing a Billy Joel concert from before I was born was an impossible task, because the earliest VHS concerts Mr. Joel has released, were performed in the 1980s...",1046217600,2,474,4.3522727272727275
