8273016,1,B00199PP7O,This DVD contains only a few dance moves that are poorly explained and poorly demonstrated.  It is not worth buying.,1258761600,2,116,4.8
8273017,1,B00199PP7O,"What a joke!!  The DVD should literally be titled ""Disco-Fox"".  DVD has three sections: Intro; Foxtrot;Disco-Foxt  Intro is a verbal narrative about dance. Foxtrot section shows about 5 moves: Basic foward/backward; Zigzag; Right Pivot turns; without narrative. Viewer has to guess at timing. Disco-Fox is the emphasize of the disc.  Lots of moves with narration throughout. Useless to me becuase I've never seen it in any ballroom dancing before.  Viewer can choose between English and German, so I assume it's for European dancing.",1237161600,2,533,5.373493975903615
