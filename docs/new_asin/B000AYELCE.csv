8324045,5,B000AYELCE,"While preparing an elaborate French dinner from Julia's original cookbook (1963)...I kept the video going in the kitchen...it kept me smiling despite the difficult recipe.  The VCR was behind me and every time she would chop something vigorously on her counter...I thought it was someone knocking on our door, and would stop to answer the door.  This happened several times until I realized what was happening...more smiles.  Everyone who enjoys cooking should have a copy!",1398124800,,473,5.28
