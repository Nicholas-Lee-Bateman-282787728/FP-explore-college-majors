8501499,5,B001QDHZYE,"Xing Yi is an ancient form of exercise. In ancient times in many cultures around the world the sciences related to and learned from the surroundings, intellectual ideas and concepts from nature:

1. Beginning with Void, Creation of one (Tao), then two (Yin & Yang), then three (Trigram) continuing to the 10,000 things.
2. Gods and deities with their example of skill and intellect.
3. 5 Elements and their interaction with each other. This led to the periodic table and quantum mechanics.
4. Animals each with their strengths and tactics.
5. Insects each with their miniature set of extreme skills to survive in a giant world.

Ancient fitness instructors had to speak and teach using the concepts that were the basis of understanding at that time.
Modern day fitness instructors inventing a new workout style strive to speak into the modern language of exercise concepts.  Examples: Aerobics, flexibility, strength development, endurance, co-ordination, muscle memory, linear, circular, lateral and diagonal movement, isometric, isotonic and plyometric forms of exercise.

Xing Yi (Mind Boxing) developed from the ancient practices which include the 5 elements and 12 animals said to be the starting point of many base strategies. Each also represents a physical exercise to develop the mind and the body. The mind boxing part has to do with an ancient concept of body, mind and spirit. In modern terms we would call this subconscious, conscious and super conscious minds. This is important in Xing Yi because the trinity stance San Ti is the starting point for each movement. Xing Yi is said to align the three minds so they synchronize and function as one mind. This is why some practitioners report better concentration after just a few weeks of training.

This video has demonstrations of the 12 animal movements of Xing Yi both solo and in a defensive situation against an attacker.

Solo Training.
The instructor Deng Fu Ming and or assistant instructor present each posture from a side view and repeat each set of motions of the animal about 5 times forward, performs the turning version of the animal posture then heading back to the starting point performing about 5 more repetitions so you can see this from both side and follow along with the motions. Hand and foot posture is explained in detail. Some reference is made to which internal organs benefit from a particular exercise. If you are new to Xing Yi you may also want to buy a Xing Yi 5 elements book or video for those aspects.

Defensive Maneuvers.
Instructor Deng Fu Ming demonstrates each animal movement against a very strong opponent coming in with attacks. He repeats the defensive maneuvers slowing down to explain how or why it works.

Language
Chinese is the spoken language used throughout the video. However both Chinese and English subtitles are available from the startup menu.",1278720000,,2862,5.023206751054852
