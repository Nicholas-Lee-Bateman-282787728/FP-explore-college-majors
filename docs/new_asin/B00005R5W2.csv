1653344,3,B00005R5W2,"Moms Mabley steals the show. From the beginning to the end, this movie will keep you laughing. It is funny, heartwarming, and amazing! Of course, by todays' standard of moviemaking, this would be considered a flop, but considering the year in which it was produced and released, this is a delightful movie.",1214870400,3,306,4.903846153846154
1653345,5,B00005R5W2,"I was surprised that Moms Mabley was on DVD.  The story plot is good and even through it was filmed a good time ago, it rings true in politics today.  It was funny while still making moral points.  I will watch it many time in the future.  This is truly a reflection from the good old days.  It is a really good way to see parts of Baltimore in the old day.",1211068800,6,357,3.9027777777777777
1653346,1,B00005R5W2,Horrible DVD! What a waste of money! No one that has watched it has ever watched the complete movie! Absolute garbage!,1209254400,,118,4.666666666666667
1653347,5,B00005R5W2,"Amazing Grace was the last movie that starred the incomparable Moms Mabley; she died only eight months after the release of this film. Amazing Grace gives us plenty of laughs, snappy dialogue and many, many scenes that allow Moms Mabley to strut her stuff and entertain us as no other comedienne ever could!

The action starts just after Grace (Moms Mabley) returns to Baltimore after a family reunion. She quickly finds out that her next door neighbor, who she barely knows because he's new to the neighborhood, is running for Mayor of Baltimore! With her platonic buddy Forthwith Wilson (Slappy White) she spies on her new neighbors, Welton Waters (Moses Gunn) and his wife Creola (Rosalind Cash). When Moms find out that the city's corrupt political machine is buying the election of Waters to use him as a paid pawn, Grace vows to take action!

Grace boldly spies even on the current mayor and helps gather damaging information on him and his machine to help Welton Waters rid himself of the political machine and run a clean campaign. As other reviewers have noted, Grace's campaign speech near the end of the movie is truly stirring. Moms Mabley outperforms even herself with this heartfelt speech encouraging younger people to fight for a better future.

Of course, it may well seem that I gave it all away--but rest assured I didn't. There are cameo roles for Butterfly McQueen and Stepin Fetchit that help to make the movie truly special. Moreover, questions still remain. Will Waters be able to win running on a totally clean platform? Will the political establishment try to block Waters even after they are exposed as crooks--and, if so, how will they fight back at Welton Waters?  What about Grace and her buddy Forthwith Wilson? Will they ever become more than just friends? Watch the movie and find out!

The cinematography could have been better in a couple of scenes; at one point Forthwith is dancing in Grace's living room and his head is partially cut off the top of the screen! The choreography works well, however, in crowd scenes including the scene in which Grace gives her speech encouraging younger people to make a better world.

Hey, this may have been a low budget film but I scarcely noticed and I really didn't care. People watch this film because they want so much to see the wonderful performances of Moms Mabley, Slappy White, James Karen as an aide to the corrupt white establishment, Butterfly McQueen--and Stepin Fetchit in a role that WASN'T demeaning to African Americans.

I highly recommend this film for fans of the stars in this movie; and if you want light hearted comedy with a touch of social commentary then this is the movie for you!

Great job, everyone! Thank you so much!",1189641600,7,2722,4.801282051282051
1653348,5,B00005R5W2,I have heard of Moms Mabley but never got a chance to see her comedy until I watched Amazing Grace.  The DVD was excellent and Moms Mabley comedy was off the hook.  I strongly recommend the DVD,1128988800,8,193,4.1891891891891895
1653349,4,B00005R5W2,"I saw this movie on cable a while back and I just laughed myself to the ground. Let me explain this movie; A older lady(Ms Moms Mabley herself, who was a gem and is gone now, but if u was around back in the day, u know what I mean); just happens to live next door to this shady politician(Moses Gunn), who if elected, will take the money slated for that area and use for his own ""uses"". Somehow, Moms has this fella(Slappy White) who helps her out in her shenanigans by putting up elaborate spy systems so they can hear the politician's business. After his high faluting wife(Rosalind Cash, who was as much a gem and gone too)puts on airs with Moms and some of the neighborhood women, Moms give her something to cry for and she and her husband in time, see the light to turn things around. Folks, this is one good movie; a bit disjointed at times, but you can catch the message just the same; Look for bit parts by Debbie Morgan and some others who are prominent now.",1101168000,26,967,4.260869565217392

1653351,5,B00005R5W2,"Lovers of the legendary Black commedienne Moms Mabley will treasure this film. In a way, it's about everything she stood for. She moves to Baltimore and gets involved when crooked politicans use a confused Black man (Moses Gunn) and his alcoholic wife (Rosiland Cash) as puppets in a phony race. Seventy-plus year old Moms steps in this mess and does her best to straighten things out! I dare anyone who remembers Moms to keep a dry eye when she gives her climactic speech to the students at Morgan State University (a real Black college in Baltimore). It's almost as if she were giving her own eulogy while still giving the students hope to fight for a better tomorrow (she had a heart attack during the filming and died shortly after it was released).
Admittedly, this is a very low-budget film with poor sound. But like I said, if you love Moms, you'll love this.",1053993600,34,866,4.62987012987013

1653370,2,B00005R5W2,"I have a fond affection for films known as Blaxploitation. When they were being released I wasn't quite old enough to see them since most were R rated, but now that Ive had the chance to go back and pick many up Ive enjoyed them immensely. Not only did they depict a time in history in the black community, they also heralded the fact that movies didn't have to be made for generic audiences, that they could be made by for and by black film makers and audiences that would enjoy them on their own.

That being said I was disappointed with AMAZING GRACE. Released in 1974 the film stars Moms Mabley, not only one of the most well-known black comediennes of her time but well known comedienne in general. Moms famous hat and denture-less look gave her an image that was recognizable in and instant along with her gravelly voice and delivery. It only seemed natural that she should make her way to a starring vehicle in theaters.

In the film Moms plays Grace, a woman who lives in a black neighborhood in Baltimore. Returning home from a trip, she brings along Forthwith Wilson (Slappy White), a just retired railroad conductor looking for something to do now. Having become friends on his last ride, she allows him to help her home and in for some fried chicken. Somehow this ends up giving him a chance to stay there for a while and to help her with a new problem she discovers once home.

It seems that a new neighbor is running for election for mayor of Baltimore. Welton Waters (Moses Gunn) is a well-dressed, well-educated man with whose wife Creola (Rosalind Cash) seems more intent on remaining in a drunken stupor than anything. Curious as to why this man would run for mayor, Grace and Forthwith begin surveilling him, going so far as to plant an elaborate bug in his house. What they discover is that Waters real motive in running is to offer a candidate who will take away enough votes from a man who has a chance at defeating the current mayor so that he can be elected once again. All of this is paid for by white money men who control the current mayor and want to continue doing so.

Grace refuses to allow this to happen to her neighborhood let alone for someone to shame the black community with this low life scheme. After a near knock down drag out with Creola, she shames Waters into admitting what is going on. Then she works with him and her community to actually make him into a candidate they can be proud and supportive of.

Id love to say this was a good movie but in truth it left a lot to be desired. To begin with Mabley, while perhaps a funny presence with her standup routine, doesnt have the power to carry and entire film by herself and thats what they have her doing here. Not only that but many of the jokes or humorous setups seem to go one much longer than they need or have the ability to sustain. Its great to see her in a film that will live on as well as several other famous past black actors like Steppin Fetchit and Butterfly McQueen, but it would have been nice to see them all in something more worth remembering.

The production values of the film are very weak, appearing no more technical expertise than a poorly filmed sitcom from the time. While the acting is strong in some of the main performers the story is truly the worst thing here. What needs to happen suddenly happens with no rhyme or reason given other than Grace wants it to be. Characters change their lifestyles and patterns with only a few words passing between them and someone like Grace, the biggest of which is a man who will sell out for tons of money who suddenly when approached by someone who says shame on you turns around and sells out his backers.

Im sure there is a place for this film in the history of Blaxploitation. It shows that there was more to that genre than horror films, pimps and black gangsters. But there was more worth watching in those films than can be seen here. Suffice to say that if you loved Moms, if you want a complete collection of Blaxploitation films or if you just want to say youve seen it then by all means pick this up. The rest of you might want to just pass it by.",1427068800,,4125,4.370273794002608
