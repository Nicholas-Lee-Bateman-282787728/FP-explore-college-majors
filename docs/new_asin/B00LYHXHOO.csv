8669093,1,B00LYHXHOO,My rating does not reflect the content of the video but the fact that the DVD stops & skips. It doesn't appear to be scratched so I'm not sure why that is. I have quite a few of her DVDs and I love them all and really wanted to incorporate this into my collection but it just doesn't play. disappointed but not enough to go through the hassle of sending it back,1509580800,,361,4.027777777777778

8669096,4,B00LYHXHOO,"This is another installment of Kelly Coffey-Meyer's 30 Minutes to Fitness series, Trim Down.  This workout contains 2 - 30 minute workouts that alternate one minute intervals of boxing and strength training.  The strength training is mainly compound movements, where you are working upper and lower body at the same time.

I like this workout, the boxing is a lot of fun and brings a lot of energy to the workout. I found some of the strength training to be a challenge!  After doing these moves for a minute it really gets your heart rate up, but that is the idea.  Kelly will introduce a strength move, for example romanian deadlifts with a high pull using both arms, then she will do a boxing segment, then a simpler variation of the previous strength move.  I liked the simpler strength moves better, but I need to work up to the harder moves and build my endurance.  This workout will definitely aid in doing that.  I found that I couldn't go really heavy with the weights here due to the pace and nature of the compound movements.  I used primarily 5 and 8 pounders, with a 10 thrown in there on occasion.  In time I might be able to increase my weight a little bit, but overall I treat this as a light to moderate weight workout.  I also should note that Kelly works out alone in this video, so there are no modifiers to follow.  It's not an issue though, since the cardio is primarily boxing there isn't a ton of high impact anyway aside from some jacks in a few segments.

Both workout 1 and 2 are the same format, just different exercises.  Out of the 2 I liked the second workout a little better than the first, but that's just a personal preference.  And as always, she has premixes added so you can customize your workout, I see myself using these quite a bit on this DVD.  Perhaps even more than the actual workouts presented.

I like Kelly a lot as an instructor, she is friendly, energetic and encouraging.  I have owned many of her workouts over the years but have gotten away from the strength work as some of the creative moves used didn't quite agree with me.  I found that many of the exercises used didn't have the twists that she is known for, which I actually prefer.  My shoulders have been known to be a little tweaky so I need to be careful.

Overall, I rate this workout 4 and a half stars, I need more interval training and this workout definitely fits the bill.  I also really enjoyed the music, which to some may sound a little dated and dare I say it a little cheesy.  I liked it!",1452988800,2,2512,4.366379310344827
8669097,5,B00LYHXHOO,"Kelly Coffey-Meyer is one of my favorite instructors--and it's just a bonus that she actually lives in my hometown.  I have most of her DVDs, although not all, as I don't necessarily click with everything she does.  I was actually a bit hesitant to try this one, as Kelly departs from her usual formula by working out alone; I thought I would miss the background exercisers.  But I decided to take a chance because I generally love Kelly's boxing workouts, and luckily, Kelly still makes things fun!

Kelly teaches live in a different studio than what she uses for most of her other workouts, sort of a lobby setting.  As with all the DVDs in her 30 Minutes to Fitness series, Trim Down features two main workouts--both interval workouts consisting of weighted compound moves alternating with boxing--plus a variety of premixes  The Main Menu offers options for Introduction - Workout One - Workout Two - Premixes - Credits.  I have broken down each segment further below.

WORKOUT ONE (32 minutes)
Kelly starts with a 4-minute warm-up (same for both workouts).  It includes moves such as marches, shoulder circles, toe taps, jabs, jump rope, knees, and concludes with lunges.  For the workout, I have listed each weighted move followed by the *boxing interval.

2) Squat Complete with alternating press

WORKOUT TWO (32 minutes.)
Kelly starts with a 4-minute warm-up (same for both workouts).  It includes moves such as marches, shoulder circles, toe taps, jabs, jump rope, knees, and concludes with lunges.  For the workout, I have listed each weighted move followed by the *boxing interval.

That's it!  I have just a few (minor) quibbles with this workout.  First, the boxing drills weren't QUITE as fun as the ones that Kelly offers in her other workouts, including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/30-Minutes-to-Fitness-TLC-Train-Like-a-Contender/dp/B004X75VAU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">30-Minutes to Fitness TLC: Train Like a Contender</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/30-Minutes-To-Fitness-Circuit-Burnt/dp/B004GEG0Z0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">30 Minutes To Fitness: Circuit Burnt</a>, most likely because the ones here are shorter (just a minute) and more simplistic.  Also, Kelly frequently says ""finish"" in these routines (especially the first), something she has said on her other DVDs as well, but here she kept saying it WAY before the end, which actually got a little annoying.  Those issues might knock a half-start off my rating, but still, I enjoyed TRIM DOWN and would recommend it.",1451865600,5,4280,5.337817638266069
8669098,3,B00LYHXHOO,Not Kelly's usual format and that was okay but I didn't like the music at ALL. Too dated.,1439164800,,89,4.0
8669099,5,B00LYHXHOO,"I needed something to mix up my workouts and get my waist and abs more involved. There are a lot of choices on this DVD. I love the boxing. Just be careful sometimes she says ""finish"" but she keeps on going.",1426118400,6,207,4.073170731707317
8669100,5,B00LYHXHOO,"Love this one!  I have several of her DVD's and I really like them all.  I have been working out regularly for about 15 years, and would consider myself to be intermediate/advanced level.  However, some of the intermediate/advanced workouts are more fast-paced than I prefer.  This workout is just right for me regarding intensity and length.  I sometimes do another 20-minute video after it if time permits.  Overall I would definitely recommend it.",1425686400,8,450,5.095890410958904
