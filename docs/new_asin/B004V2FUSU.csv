8442624,4,B004V2FUSU,"The movie has a good social subject and is about caste ism and monopoly in villages of India. The hero takes up the fight for the commoners and ultimately executes the tyrants. Rajesh Khanna the Super Star is the hero of the movie and is supported well by Sridevi, Jaya Prada and Padmini Kolhapore. Kader Khan plays the tyrant supported by Ranjeet. The movie is mounted well, good sets, good editing, good direction. The movie had above average music by Bappi Lahiri. This hit is a must see for Rajesh Khanna fans as he plays the role of the protagonist to perfection and puts up great performance. He is good in dance and action scenes also in the movie. Him dancing with young Sridevi is a treat to watch.",1305849600,,707,4.488372093023256
