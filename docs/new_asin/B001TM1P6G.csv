8342061,5,B001TM1P6G,A good adaption to the street fighter genre. Amust buy for any fan. Only issue with these movies is they don't release as often as fans like.,1360108800,,141,4.2592592592592595
8342062,5,B001TM1P6G,"This anime is obviously based off the Street Fighter IV video game and was released with the game's special edition. A lot of fans say this anime was way too short and was a disappointment but I strongly disagree. The anime is about an hour and a half which is definitley long enough in my opinion (Even if it's only 45 mins to an hour long, that's still plenty of animated Hadoukens for even the most hardcore fans), the animation was good and I got to see enough of the Street Fighter cast in action to be satisfied. This is also the only Street Fighter anime that can be considered a direct sequel to ANY of the other Street Fighter animes. The bluray version also comes with the SFIV soundtrack which is pretty cool. If you're a Street Fighter fan or an action anime fan I'd say it's a definite buy. An 8.5 out of 10 in my book.",1303430400,3,832,4.238993710691824
8342063,1,B001TM1P6G,"Say what you will about the Van Dame movie and the ""Legend of Chun Li"" movie but both of those were 100x better than this. One of the worst animes ever made. There's nothing good here. The animation is horrible, the storyline is horrible, the voice acting is horrible. Sakura's English voice actor makes me want to reach into my TV and strangle her.

If you're a die hard SF fan, you're better off not watching this. It'll only make you angry.",1247443200,4,443,4.402439024390244
8342064,2,B001TM1P6G,"I got this movie with my xbox 360 collectors edition. I was excited to watch it due to the high quality of the other anime series but that high quality was not put in to this hour long anime. The voice acting is bad and it seems like they barely tried to sync up the American voice acting. If you are a die hard fan pick it up, butif you are just a gamer like me I would say pass on this.",1237939200,3,388,3.7439024390243905
