4899332,5,B005WJX1Q4,"""Garrow's Law"" is so interesting. It boggles the mind when you watch the cases (especially in the first series) and think, wait a minute, they can't do that! - when, of course, they can, because there was no adversarial judicial system as we are used to. And because being part of the nobility, even a small part, used to make you immune. Each episode stars a new case, and all of them are based on real cases tried in England during the time period.

The characters are great, and knowing it's based on real-life makes it even better. But it is the scripts and cases that keep me coming back for more.

The reasons given for axing ""Garrow's Law"" don't seem adequate to a fan. See the RadioTimes on-line article I copied at the end of this review. But, alas, Series 3 is the last we'll see of William Garrow, played with stubborn high-mindedness by Andrew Buchan. Garrow (the real Garrow) was called to the Bar in 1783, and made his name as counsel for the defence (Brit for defense) - the period we see in the TV show. In 1793, though, he did rise to become a King's prosecutor, and was eventually knighted.

This is an online listing of cases heard in the Old Bailey between 1674 and 1913. It doesn't always give a lot of detail. Sometimes, though, an entry includes a full transcript, questions and answers, the older ones in ""old English"". These include transcripts of actual William Garrow court appearances. I found the following entry for a court case involving Sir William, which occured years after those shown in the TV series:

LAWRENCE HALLORAN , alias LAWRENCE HYNES HALLORAN , alias WILLIAM CHARLES GREGORY , was indicted for that he, after the 1st of July, 1802, to wit, on the 9th of January, in the 57th year of his Majesty's reign , feloniously did forge and counterfeit the hand-writing of a certain person, to wit, Sir William Garrow , Knt. , the said Sir William Garrow, then being a member of the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom, and being entitled to send letters by the post to places within the said United Kingdom, free from the duty of postage, in the superscription of a letter to be sent, and which was afterwards sent, by the post, to wit, from London to Broseley, in the county of Salop, in order to avoid the payment of the duty of postage upon and in respect of the said letter, against the statute .

.............................................

Here's the February 6, 2012. RadioTimes on-line article, by Jack Seale, giving the bad news:

Garrow's Law has been axed by BBC1, the channel has confirmed.

The drama, co-created by Tony Marchant, centred on real 18th-century lawyer William Garrow (Andrew Buchan), whose daring acceptance of unfashionable or controversial cases helped to liberalise the legal system.

Garrow's Law had seemed to be a continuing success: at the end of 2011 it had more than four million regular viewers on Sunday nights, despite being up against the likes of The X Factor and I'm a Celebrity... on ITV1.

""BBC1 will screen more than 20 new dramas this year, but Garrow's Law will not be returning,"" confirmed a spokeswoman for the channel - and the decision not to renew Garrow's Law underlines BBC1's commitment to new drama under controller Danny Cohen.

Cohen has already chopped popular existing dramas, such as Zen and Lark Rise to Candleford, to make way for new series - a strategy that is arguably working well at the moment in the form of the ratings-busting Call the Midwife. With Garrow's Law having already run for three series, and with the series three finale serving as a viable swansong for the programme as a whole, it was perhaps an obvious target for Cohen's axe.

In any case, like Lark Rise - axed primarily because its writer, Bill Gallagher, no longer wished to continue with it - Garrow's Law is perhaps a casualty of how in-demand its main writer is. Tony Marchant has already written Public Enemies for BBC1 this year and has been commissioned to pen Leaving for ITV1. He also has plans to revive and update his 1997 breakthrough, Holding On, the state-of-the-nation drama about disparate characters living in London.

4899333,5,B005WJX1Q4,"Based on reality. Historically keen. One plot connects 4 episodes. Each episode also has a challenging court/social issue of the period. Andrew Buchan (Return to Cranford) is a convincing Garrow (1760-1840). Southouse (Alun Armstrong -New Tricks, Little Dorrit) is back as law mentor. Rupert Graves (Forsyte Saga) continues as Sir Arthur. Returned are Lyndsey Marshal, Aidan McArdle, and Michael Culkin, all having been in every previous Garrow's Law episode.

SUBTITLES for each episode as well as the behind the scenes bonus, filmed in the Scottish location studio. It's a brilliant third series, in my opinion, and my wife's, but then we fell in love with the first episode. All 3 series are recommended BBC viewing. Costumes/sets and atmosphere are believable. Even some of the dialogue was taken from court records, I heard on the bonus.

1 ""Insanity Plea"" Mad or murderer? Garrow  tries to prove the failed suicidal assassin a lunatic but that even riles King Go. III, not altogether himself. Then there's Lady Sarah (Lyndsey Marshal) and a brief nude shot.

2 ""King's (States') Evidence"" ""Worker conditions."" Garrow agrees to defend two weavers charged with loom breakage. One claiming it the other. Southouse fights jail fever & death. Lady Sarah has a confrontation over ongoing troubles.

3 ""Political Corruption"" Garrow prosecutes a bad colonial Gov. & exposes a corrupt system. Will Garrow fall victim to the corruption for Lady Sarah's sake?

4 ""Limit police power"" Garrow grieves. Sarah leaves. Sir Arthur rages. Pinnock (Harry Melling in last of 3 episode appearances) finds Garrow yet another case; one of murder at the polls. An explosive, emotional end to Garrow's Law.

I'm hoping for a Series 4.",1339804800,12,1715,5.192028985507246
4899334,5,B005WJX1Q4,"I think the most fascinating aspect of Garrow's Law is that this is not a fictional account. Although not as widely known as perhaps he warrants, William Garrow was a prominent English lawyer, initially specialising in defence and subsequently becoming a Member of Parliament and Solicitor General.

Garrow is widely credited as being the father of the adversarial system of justice which is in use in many countries with forthright cross examination of witnesses. His insistence that hearsay evidence should not be admissible led to the rules on `best evidence'. Each of these episodes is based on a true case from the annals of the Old Bailey, England's premier criminal court, although not necessarily one which Garrow was involved with. For example this season's first episode concerns a disturbed individual called James Hadfield. He has directed a shot towards the Prince Regent at Drury Lane Theatre and, it emerges, was attempting suicide in what would be described in the modern idiom as `death by cop'. A quick search through Google will confirm that, as with all cases in Garrow's Law, this was a real case.

Garrow's personal life is also based on fact, as he had a long term relationship and later married Sarah, who had previously borne a child by a Viscount. Obviously the script writer has had to fill in the gaps, but it appears that the significant facts which can be checked out are correct so what we have here is a fascinating insight into the workings of the legal system a little over two hundred years ago, and the life and work of a highly influential individual.

As in the previous two series the main criticism is that the season is so short, comprising only four episodes to go with the eight previously. There is a tendency in the UK towards short series although four seems to be taking this to extremes. Perhaps basing the stories on real cases is the limiting factor here. The really bad news is that it has now been confirmed that there will be no more series of Garrow's Law for reasons which are not clear.",1330300800,48,2042,4.746478873239437

He's great (as an actor, not as a character) in Garrow's Law but that's about all I liked in this series. I've watched most of the episodes multiple times but I really didn't care for in in the long run. It's not a bad show, just not very memorable and it's relatively hard to really care about the characters. All of the actors are excellent, it's the writing that brought the show down.

This season is particularly addictive and it will be hard to not sit and watch all four episodes in one sitting.  Some of the inequities of the colonial system are brought to light, the low wages of the looms and weavers are also revealed, and some of the intricacies of the very pro-male law of the era are brought out, too.

4899350,5,B005WJX1Q4,"I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed following this series and how disappointed I am that it was cancelled after only three seasons. Garrow's Law is the best Georgian era series I've ever encountered. The plots are dramatic, the costumes perfect, and the attention to historical detail extreme. Thankfully, this final season doesn't end in a cliffhanger but manages to wrap up all the storylines and leave us in a comfortable place.",1398124800,,434,4.958904109589041
4899351,5,B005WJX1Q4,"After a temporary drop-off in quality during season two of this historical series chronicling the life and extraordinary career of real-life ground-breaking barrister William Garrow, the last episodes in the series (comprising Series 3) are excellent.  Every detail of the period is evoked and even though the series was modestly produced, it is wholly convincing in its period and setting, (Garrows early career from 1783 to 1793) despite a few errors such as having someone play Beethovens piece Fur Elise, even though the original manuscript is dated 1810 and the piece was not actually published until the mid-19th-Century.

Nit-picking aside, there is much to enjoy in each of the final four episodes of this series.  Individual episode story arcs nicely complement the overall series arc and resolve the main plot points satisfactorily and without feeling forced.  Even Rupert Graves, the villain throughout the series, is given his due in a way that is unexpected and fair.  An interesting behind-the-scenes featurette reminds the viewer just how modest the production of the series was, making the achievement of the final product that much more impressive.

Legal dramas have long been a staple diet of television programming. Crafting scripts that interweave compelling points of law and high personal stakes in an 18th-Century setting  really sets GARROWS LAW apart from other shows.  Having its basis in reality adds to the strength of the series, even though some of the cases that inspired plots were not cases Garrow actually worked on.  Theyre still taken from period records and almost all have the ring of authenticity about them.

Andrew Buchan loses some of his hot-headedness as he matures as Garrow, which helps the series feel as if it is evolving and not just repeating itself.  Alun Armstrong as Garrows mentor steals centre stage throughout, which is not surprising given his experience as a performer.  His presence gives the show depth and authority.

Series 3 is a must-have for anyone who has enjoyed the show up til now.  It ties up loose ends and continues to grow right up to the last few minutes.  An excellent production featuring an important and little-known champion of human rights.",1397433600,2,2221,5.147632311977716
4899352,5,B005WJX1Q4,"I wonder why this amazing series came to such an abrupt end? I could watch it for years to come and be fascinated by it. I think particularly here in the States, the history we got in school and then our subsequent interest in this era is geared more to the American and French Revolutions -so we missed the fascinating occurrences in Britain just as it was to emerge as a super power in the Victorian era.

In series three, madness is given a legal definition, trade unions vs exploitation of labor are considered, grotesque abuses of power in the colonies -and what defines a human being- is taken up in court, and finally Garrow's personal life with Sarah is resolved as the odious Lord Melville gets his comeuppance.

I wish there were more episodes and am sad to see an end to this unique series.  Highly recommended.",1395619200,,822,4.54054054054054
4899353,5,B005WJX1Q4,"This is the crime procedural I have enjoyed more than any other i have viewed on television. What a great man Garrow was, and what a truly great shame so few episodes were made commemorating his life and work. Nevertheless, I had never heard of Garrow before coming across this series so I can at least regard my awareness of his life as a true bonus. It is, however unfortunate that a nation with so many excellent script writers as Britain did not produce a lengthier series more worthy of this man's memory. Marvellous cases were reconstructed from cases of the period. Could not some more have been done like this, or as a product of the truly imaginative British writers?Thank you,

4899360,5,B005WJX1Q4,"This was probably one of the weakest episodes of the entire series, but still worth 5 stars for all that. The loss of Alun Armstrong as part of the proceedings is keenly felt, and the entire conflict with Sarah and Arthur over Samuel is tidied up too neatly, albeit in a very satisfying way. I get the feeling that they knew they were not going to get a new season at this point and had to charge through at a breakneck pace to tidy up all the lose ends, but Garrow's turns in the courtroom are no less powerful for all of that. He may not be able to bring down the guilty parties in the end, but the fate of the revolting Lord Meville is sure to delight those who have been watching both seasons.  I certainly hope we get more in the future, but if this is the last episode, it does credit to everyone who helped create it.",1375747200,,824,4.118012422360248

It turns out to be one of the best costume dramas to come out of the UK in years.  All the court cases are horribly true.  For those of us lucky enough to live under a legal system derived from England can see that some things have improved in 200 years.  This is not a documentary of course, but a cracking drama lead by Andrew Buchan and Alun Armstrong.  Watching Mr Buchan weep for a little boy his character has failed to save from the gallows is something never to forget.
The series is also remarkably funny with Alun Armstrong getting the best lines:  "" Well, you have made an enemy of the Attorney General, so there is some progress"".  Don't miss this.",1352073600,5,873,4.440251572327044
4899381,4,B005WJX1Q4,"This show really showcased how important a man like the real Garrow was. His innovations and courage led the way to the modern courtroom. This series ties up all the loose ends and does it in a satisfactory manner. However we could  have had more series as the real Garrow lived to a ripe old age and practiced law well into the 19th century. Still I disagree with the three star reviewer who says this one deals too much with his personal life. In fact every series was full of MANY scenes featuring the struggle between Garrow and Lady Sarah's Husband.  IN fact series two has a whole episode about Garrow and infedility charges!  So that review rather baffled me!. The acting a production values remain high and I was surprised to find that the BBC shot this in Glascow! Mainly on several large sets. No doubt the same studio used for the excellent tv series 'sea of souls' from last decade. You get a behind the scenes featurrette in this one too. Which shows how much effort it takes to make a tv show and how they reuse the sets in different ways.  This show is excellent but it only has four episodes in this one, however you MUST start at series one to watch this show properly.  The dvd looks very good as they shot this on high def film. This is not hd though, it's standard def. I highly recommend this series, it takes you back to the 18th century ,which was a very brutal time and the actors all pull out the stops to deliver fine performances.",1350777600,,1457,4.361623616236162

4899384,4,B005WJX1Q4,"Very interesting costume drama about an assertive lawyer (barrister?) in 18th Century England whose interest is always in protecting the meek and the innocent from the rich and famous connivers who would have their way regardless of their brand of ""justice"". When tired of the juvenile and unnecessarily violent junk that masquerades these days as ""drama"" on networks and cable stations, try the Garrow Series.",1348963200,2,410,5.323076923076923
4899385,5,B005WJX1Q4,"Excellent series. The acting is superb! I particular enjoy period drama. I only wish there was going to be a series 4.
I highly recommend Series 1, 2 and 3.",1348358400,,156,4.233333333333333
4899386,5,B005WJX1Q4,I have enjoyed every minute.  The only fault I can find with the series is that there will not be a Season Four.,1348012800,,112,3.869565217391304
4899387,5,B005WJX1Q4,"Fabulous!  Wasn't quite certain what to expect, but both my husband and I LOVED the series so far, and can't wait for the next season!
Acting great, story within story honest, and an education into the formulation/ development of our justice system as it began in jolly ole England.  Now, hoping that doesn't sound ""stuffy"" because the story is definitely NOT tedious or boring at all!!!",1347667200,2,387,4.848484848484849
4899388,3,B005WJX1Q4,"Unfortunately, Garrow's Law did not stick to the courtroom and the cases. Instead it wandered into the relationship of Garrow and the woman he loved who just happened to be married. While season 3 wraps all of that mess up, the series didn't survive the soap-opera direction it took. If you've followed Garrow's Law, you'll probably want to see the final season, and some of you may actually enjoy the focus on Garrow and Lady Sarah. I didn't.",1347235200,4,443,4.6923076923076925
4899389,5,B005WJX1Q4,"THis is such an upstanding, classy, intelligent production.  Everything about it is 5 star, and I cannot believe there will no be more.  Garrow's integrity sets such a fine example.",1347062400,2,181,5.0
4899390,5,B005WJX1Q4,Well worth the time and cost.  My wife and I truly enjoyed this series. The English have a fascinating history and the evolution of courts and jury trials is essential to our (American) systems.  Fun 'chick flick' elements for the ladies as well.,1346976000,,246,4.6976744186046515
4899391,5,B005WJX1Q4,"Garrow's Law (all seasons, including season 3) have been very entertaining and most enjoyable to watch.  I am still giving season 3 a five star rating, but I do find that the storyline has become less interesting and more narrow since the first season.  I hope the writers will change this in the next season.",1346889600,,309,4.6
4899392,5,B005WJX1Q4,"We have purchased and viewed all three series of Garrow's Law. These are so well made, well acted and based on historical records and court proceedings. It's fascinating to see what a court of law used to be and how Garrow fought for justice for the common man. It was a harsh experience for anyone who ended up accused of a crime  in court. I highly recommend this series to anyone who loves British TV and the law.",1346803200,2,416,4.333333333333333
4899393,5,B005WJX1Q4,"I think the most fascinating aspect of Garrow's Law is that this is not a fictional account. Although not as widely known as perhaps he warrants, William Garrow was a prominent English lawyer, initially specialising in defence and subsequently becoming a Member of Parliament and Solicitor General.

Garrow is widely credited as being the father of the adversarial system of justice which is in use in many countries with forthright cross examination of witnesses. His insistence that hearsay evidence should not be admissible led to the rules on `best evidence'. Each of these episodes is based on a true case from the annals of the Old Bailey, England's premier criminal court, although not necessarily one which Garrow was involved with. For example this season's first episode concerns a disturbed individual called James Hadfield. He has directed a shot towards the Prince Regent at Drury Lane Theatre and, it emerges, was attempting suicide in what would be described in the modern idiom as `death by cop'. A quick search through Google will confirm that, as with all cases in Garrow's Law, this was a real case.

Garrow's personal life is also based on fact, as he had a long term relationship and later married Sarah, who had previously borne a child by a Viscount. Obviously the script writer has had to fill in the gaps, but it appears that the significant facts which can be checked out are correct so what we have here is a fascinating insight into the workings of the legal system a little over two hundred years ago, and the life and work of a highly influential individual.

As in the previous two series the main criticism is that the season is so short, comprising only four episodes to go with the eight previously. There is a tendency in the UK towards short series although four seems to be taking this to extremes. Perhaps basing the stories on real cases is the limiting factor here. The really bad news is that it has now been confirmed that there will be no more series of Garrow's Law for reasons which are not clear.",1345507200,,2042,4.746478873239437
4899394,4,B005WJX1Q4,"I realize that this series ran for about three seasons but it was not so well marketed, at least on this side of the Atlantic.  The cast is brilliant, the story line engaging, the costumes and sets realistic and yet with all of these marvelous things in its favor it was unable to sustain a following of greater magnitude.  It is a shame!  Shame!  One can only hope that there will be a re-think on this show despite the fact that most of the actors have gone on to other projects.  I highly recommend every episode in all three series.  I've watched them all and I wish there were more.",1344556800,,587,4.290909090909091
8487945,5,B005WJX1Q4,"The triumphant finale, where all is resolved and, SPOILER alert, justice triumphs. The nephew is a fascinating character, who doesn't end up where you expect.

8487948,5,B005WJX1Q4,"Fascinating series, well acted and scripted.  The series is based on an actual lawyer and his cases who had a profound effect on English Common Law.  The script takes some liberty with the facts of his life but in general sticks to the important elements of the landmark cases he dealt with.  The settings are superb.  Well worth watching.  Too bad there are not twice as many episodes",1499558400,,385,4.602941176470588
