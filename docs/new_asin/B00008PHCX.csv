1857082,5,B00008PHCX,"I watched this television series as a child of the fifties and was totally mesmerised by all of it's cinematic wonders, which were obviously limited at the time.  I was greatly pleased to see that this was to be released to DVD last month.  Sometimes you wonder if past TV shows and movies have stood the test of time, SUPERCAR has most definitely.  It is as real today as it was back then when I was a gullible child of eight.  And...with the onset of DVD, the quality is even better now, with every episode intact and order of presentation.  Thank you for this memory of my childhood that I can now treasure forever!!!!!",1055289600,19,622,4.421052631578948

1857109,5,B00008PHCX,"All 39 episodes of this landmark Gerry Anderson sci-fi series from the early 1960s are here on five DVDs in their proper running order. Supercar marks the evolutionary origin of the Andersons marionette-based TV sci-fi series, to later culminate in the far more sophisticated Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet.

The restoration of these old monochrome episodes is nothing short of fantastic, crisp and sharp and far better than they looked on the old 1961 425-line black & white TV sets. Sound quality is also excellent.

Gerry Andersons Supercar storylines are full of great humor, and the characters relate to each other with a warmth and innocence mostly absent from latter-day childrens TV. The distinctive cast of core characters includes two different eccentric scientists called Beaker & Popkiss, dashing Supercar pilot Mike Mercury and Jimmy, the boy introduced in the first episode who becomes part of the Supercar team and with whom one supposes the young target audience was intended to identify. There is also the usual animal pet (a mischievous monkey called Mitch) and classic comic villain Masterspy modelled as a grotesque caricature with an Arabic (?) accent, inevitably bettered by the Supercar team in every episode he appears. The sets are crude and low-budget, but all the more endearing for that.

Supercar was so successful that Gerry & Sylvia Anderson were contracted to make a series of subsequent puppet shows (marionettes were deployed originally because the production team couldn't afford to pay real actors!): Fireball XL5, then Stingray - the first produced in colour - and the larger and more spectacular 12-character Thunderbirds. This is classic British childrens TV from the 1960s, exported worldwide and a hugely successful business venture for the Andersons. The depiction of non-Western characters in the Supercar stories might appear embarrassingly patronising to modern sensibilities, but despite such anachronisms which date the series to a bygone age of innocence prior to the ubiquitous hectoring voice of political correctness, the storylines still stand up well in the 21st century.",1462492800,,2126,5.397590361445783

1857172,5,B00008PHCX,"I just watched my way through the entire set, and had a wonderful time. There's a lot of retro fun in looking back at a future that is a product of another age. Gerry Anderson would be better known for his later work, like Thunderbirds, but this is where it all came together for the first time: exciting looking vehicles, straight forward adventure stories with heroic action, and a lot of gentle humor. As a go anywhere, do anything vehicle, Supercar is a great plot device supported by a great cast - even if they are marionettes!

The sound quality is very good, and so is the image quality.  Considering the budget and technology limitations of the time, the production values are amazing. Supercar is also a look back at a particular time in history: the jet age was just getting into full swing, the space age was taking its first baby steps, and we were poking into the last untouched corners of the planet. (Anyone remember the IGY?)  Several of the stories seem downright prophetic - a medical mercy mission flight to retrieve a researcher at the Pole in the middle of the arctic winter; an un-named small country trying to smuggle atomic bombs into the United States; a tinpot dictator sponsoring the highjacking of an airliner... That it's all in black and white just contributes to the overall charm of the show.

Great fun!",1360281600,2,1337,4.6525423728813555
1857183,5,B00008PHCX,"Super car Review
What a joy it has been to see these old episodes of Super car. As a young child they really fired my imagination. The sets were very elaborate, and the plots were very sophisticated and the technology depicted was cutting edge for the time frame. The Master Spy character reminds me of villain on the James Bond movie Gold Finger,  Gert Frbe . It no wonder I chose a career in technology, because the images displayed on this show really inspired me so long ago. Thank for bring them back. My grandson is now enjoying them.  Thank you.",1359072000,2,552,4.455445544554456
1857184,5,B00008PHCX,"Gerry Anderson died yesterday, and so I'm going to move up my very brief review of Supercar (and Fireball XL5) in tribute to this man, who obviously has brought much joy to so many people over the years. I first encountered Supercar as a comic book, finding it very strange that people should be drawn that way -- I took it at the time as a stylistic quirk. Then, weeks or months later, I stumbled upon the same characters -- and Supercar -- on television, and it was the start of a very long love affair. This was of course Anderson's first marionette series, and the awful technical shortcomings are all too obvious now -- for some strange reason, my family's television in the early 1960s was unable to pick them up -- but as at least one other reviewer as noted, those flaws help make the show so endearing, particularly in retrospect for those of us who watched it the first time around. This was mankind's first step into a surreal world of dreamlike adventure. Thank you, Gerry. Thank you so very much.",1356566400,3,1009,4.489130434782608

The only thing there might some  traffic with people with other Super Cars.  But I doubt it, it would
truly be one of a kind. A great imagination and dream back in the 60's.  So grab the kids and neighbors

My parents even bought me a supercar for christmas and it was a cool thing to get at that time. Every time supercar came on I brought out my supercar and I pretended that I was flying supercar.

1857208,4,B00008PHCX,"I have fond memories of this series from when I was about nine or ten (viewing it again I realize that I probably actually saw no more than eight or ten of the segments), and I was surprised and delighted to see it available on DVD.  In an isolated laboratory in the desert at Blackrock, NV, an easy drive from Batesville and a couple of hours' bus time from Carson City, a three-man team has labored for five years to produce the vehicle of the future.  The men are the craggy, bedroom-eyed American test pilot, Mike Mercury; jolly, bespectacled German, Prof. Adolf Popkiss; and the brilliant but terminally absentminded Britisher, Dr. Horatio Beeker, whose eccentricities often land him (and sometimes the rest of the team as well) in trouble.  The vehicle, Supercar, is, as Mike says, ""like an airplane, only better"": she can fly from Nevada to New York City in 15 min. (not only super- but hypersonic), or loaf along at 1000 MPH (""low safe cruising speed"")--2500 MPH at an altitude of 50,000' provides best fuel economy; she can operate at 4 1/2 miles below the surface of the sea, or in low earth orbit (100-1240 mi. up); she's even been known to travel the British motorways, though her altimeter keeps insisting she's going to crash if Mike doesn't put another 150 feet under her belly plates, and her armor is so stout that she shrugs off bullets without so much as a dent.  On her first mission following the completion of testing, she rescues Bill Gibson, his 10-year-old brother Jimmy, and Jimmy's beloved pet monkey Mitch (much more intelligent than the average monkey, but equally mischievous) after their light plane ditches in the Pacific and their life raft goes astray in a heavy fog, and for reasons never fully explained Jimmy and Mitch are invited to stay at the lab with the team while Bill goes on to operate his small indy trucking business and later enter the astronaut corps.  Thereafter Supercar and her team assist people in trouble (from a Chinese oldster threatened with the destruction of the temple he cares for, to a deposed political leader) and tackle criminals, spies, and assorted other baddies, most notably the fat and sinister Masterspy and his cowardly cohort Zahrin (who, though they're Russian, are eventually revealed as freelancers, stealing secrets and devices to sell to the highest bidder, and occasionally doing a job for hire, as in ""Hi Jack"") and the British white-collar criminal Harper and his Cockney muscleman Judd.  The team is also very much aware of being a team, and willingly goes the extra mile for one another: once when Mitch becomes ill, Mike flies Dr. Beeker to the Amazon jungle in search of a plant that may cure him; when Prof. Popkiss has an appendectomy and needs a transfusion of blood from a rare group, Mike takes his doctor to an isolated research station in the Arctic to obtain plasma from a fellow scientist.

As other reviewers have observed, the strings of Supercar and the puppets all too often show (apparently invisible thread hadn't been invented yet), body proportions aren't always right, there are various cartoonish explosions that leave people smoke-stained and dishevelled but uninjured, and the lab and control consoles are implausibly simple, but for what it is, the special effects are surprisingly good (especially when Supercar's jets fire), and there's a good deal of creative use of stock footage--artillery against the horizon, African wildlife in its native habitat, a Naval ship at sea, a nuclear blast.  There are also some implausibilities of plot, notably in ""Island Incident"" (how did the deposed General get from his island nation to the California desert, and once there, in those days before cell phones, how was he able to contact the Supercar team for help?) and in the fate of the recurring bad guys (why, once the team has them in its power, don't they end up securely in prison?).  The violence quotient, however, is very low (though there's occasional shooting, particularly in one segment where the team is besieged at the lab by Masterspy and cohorts and Dr. Beeker shows himself to be a determined marksman with a machine gun, nobody is ever killed), and there's a lot of humor, some of it rather subtle, some more kid-friendly (as when Mike, testing his new pilot-ejector seat, twice ends up atop a cactus).  As an adult I can still enjoy and appreciate this series and wish it could have lasted longer.  (Believe it or not, somebody online is working on a full-video continuation!)  Kids, even today's sophisticates, should like it too, especially with Jimmy as a focus for their own fantasies (as he once says, ""I bet lots of kids would love to be where I am"").",1258934400,5,4678,4.841051314142678

1857211,5,B00008PHCX,"When I was a seven years old back in the mid sixties this was my favorite show.  For years I was looking for it on VHS to no avail.  One night a cable access show played an episode and it brought me back to that time in my childhood.  That was the first time in about fort-five years that I saw an episode.  A couple of years ago I saw the box set DVD on Amazon for about $85.  Not sure if I would still like the show for that price I decided to wait to see if the price would drop.  Well it did an I just finished watching all 39 episodes for the first time in over forty-five years.  The video quality is very good, but sometimes the volume drops for Jimmy and for several ""guest characters"".  This is only a problem when watching late at night when I keep the volume down so I don't bother my neighbors.  This is probably due to the fact that the show is old and might not have been preserved properly.  If you remember this show and liked it then I highly recommend getting this set of the original Supermarionation.  I believe this was the first show of it's kind followed by other shows by Gerry Anderson and company like Thunderbirds and Stingray.  Yes you can see the strings but that's fine with me.  Yes it is in black and white but that's Ok also.  This was a time when there was no doubt who the good guys were.  I love the fact that you never see any one getting into Supercar, they are standing next to it then they cut back and they are in Supercar.  They can stand by a doorway but can't go through it because of the strings.  The plot lines are simple, Supercar is needed to save someone so off they go.  Today plot lines in TV shows aren't much more complicated.  Mike Mercury is the American, Dr. Beaker is ""most excellent"" as the English scientist and is my favorite.  Mitch the monkey can be a little annoying due to his screeching.  Prof. Popkiss is the other scientist with a German accent.  Jimmy is a kid they saved in the pilot episode who stayed with the Supercar team.  They made this show on a shoestring budget and you can see the love and sweat that went into it.  The other shows that followed are in color but this was the one that caught my imagination.  I enjoyed watching these shows and was happy to see them for the first time in forty-five years.

1857223,5,B00008PHCX,"I remember watching ""Supercar"" and being fascinated by the technical abilities of the vehicle itself.  The fact that all the actors were puppets and the strings were visible never detracted from the overall wonder of the show.
With the passing of years I am again flabbergasted with Gerry Anderson's imagination and foresight.  Supercar was far and away more advanced than we could have imagined.  To begin with, many of Supercar's technological attributes were unheard of in the 60's,  It was a jet/rocket powered, vertical takeoff, supersonic vehicle capable of suborbital flight.  Supercar was equipped with a video system that could see through fog, smoke, and in the dark.  The vehicle's display showed a moving map that gave the exact location and direction you were going.
How long did the world take to catch up to Gerry Anderson's visions.  We now have vertical takeoff and landing jet aircraft.  Private enterprise has produced an aircraft capable of suborbital flight.  Forward Looking Infra-Red systems see through smoke, fog, and in the dark.  Global Positioning Systems are available in our cars and as hand-held devices.
Entertainment and science were beautifully intertwined in this ""kids"" program.  It's just as enjoyable now as it was then.  I find it more interesting when I see how technology finally caught up with Supercar.",1218672000,6,1345,5.2046511627906975
1857224,5,B00008PHCX,"ONE OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS ABOUT THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION IS THAT IT ENABLES ME TO RE-LIVE MY CHILDHOOD. IT IS SO GREAT TO BE ABLE TO WATCH THESE TIMLESS EPISODES OF ""SUPER CAR"". IN MY YOUTH, THE 50'S AND 60'S, I NEVER DREAMED I WOULD EVER SEE TV SHOWS LIKE THIS AGAIN. SUPER CAR'S PLOTS AND DIALOG ARE HIGHLY INTELLIGENT AND INVOLVES ""REAL"" SCIENCE; NOT THE PUESDO SCIENCE OF STAR TREK. ""SUPER CAR"" WASN'T CREATED BY A MARKET STUDY, IT WAS ART; A LOVING DEVOTION.

This was made for kids like I was when this was new. It's awesome to see it surface after all these years. If you remember Mike Mercury and Supercar, you NEED this series.

1857226,5,B00008PHCX,"When Supercar was on TV in the 60's I would not got out and play with my friends. They all knew when Supercar was on and they would not bother me at that time.

This set is all that was promised and more. I believe it has every episode, as well as documentary of how it was made and commentary from one of the producers. Unfortunately, my kids don't really like it, so I rarely get time to view it. This is really a nostalgia piece for children of the 50's and 60's. I don't think most kids will like it.",1181174400,6,504,3.99009900990099
1857227,5,B00008PHCX,"For some reason this show always stood out in my memory. It was probably my first TV obsession. I remember being thrilled by the adventures of Mike and the rest of the crewn and intrigued by the concept of the Supercar. When the price dropped this week there was no longer any excuse not to buy it.

When I received the set, I immediately watched episode one. Amazingly, it was just like I remembered it after 45+ years. I even remember plotlines and specific scenes. This is really a great collection, and the quality is outstanding. I have been disappointed when I got DVD sets of some of my childhood favorites, but not Supercar. Simply amazing!!",1174003200,5,649,4.594827586206897
1857228,5,B00008PHCX,"The 'sixties opened with some great cartoons: The Bugs Bunny Show, The Flntstones, and this odd non-cartoon from Britain, which seemed to be puppets, or marionetttes (you could see the strings), excitingly more real than cartoons, with futuristic styling, a haunting theme, and the lure for Americans of being British. It was filmed in Supermarionation, whatever that was, and it absolutely caught on, and had the yanks clamoring for more. Plenty more was in store, including the state of the art Thunderbirds, but here's where it all began. These absolutely beautiful black and white prints recreate all the indefinable magic of what remains a compelling and creative show. This is the textbook for how it's done, and the dialogue and writing are just a marvel. How many viewers did this show lure into animation with a stop action 8 mm camera and a toy plane? How many Supercar toys and games made the colonies absolute addicts for Gerry Anderson's many endeavors to come? 39 remastered episodes on 5 discs, plus extras, of the Marvel of the Age.",1107043200,16,1048,4.926553672316384
1857229,1,B00008PHCX,"This is the worst of the Gerry Anderson ""Supermarianation"" shows. But I guess not every show can't be Thunderbirds. Supercar has one of the ugliest puppets ever created as the ""star"" of the show. The episodes that I watched were very boring and kids will find this show unwatchable.

Get Thunderbirds instead...",1097798400,4,311,4.980769230769231

The video on these DVDs are extremely high-quality--Supercar looks as good as the day it first aired.  There are some Supercar videos available on VHS, I might mention, that look terrible!  My only gripe with this DVD set is that there are only a few extras.  If you're a Gerry Anderson fan, you'll want to own these DVDs.",1060819200,23,426,4.4935064935064934
1857232,5,B00008PHCX,"This is the first fully developed supermarionation series from Gerry Anderson and its shortcomings are what make it so endearing to me. While his later series became very sophisticated and the marionettes act less and less like puppets, in ""Supercar"" you have puppets acting and looking like puppets. Sometimes the eyes are simply painted on the heads of the puppets so that they never move. The anatomical proportions are way off so that you have large, goofy looking heads on slim, small bodies. The arms tend to wave wildly about when speaking. I like all of this: The Nelson Eddy like vocal singing/shouting the opening theme song, ""Supercar!!!"", the very visible strings pulling supercar up out of the water, the back screen projection of clouds and water (which actually works out well here), the ""not quite right"" miniature furniture (later series would scale down perfectly with obsessive attention to detail), the very simple and absurdly low budget lab equipment (although the Supercar model still looks great today). This is the Anderson series to get if you really like the 1959 look of kiddie shows. It is the earliest link in the evolutionary ladder of the Gerry Anderson series. Perfectly charming and fun.",1057622400,49,1221,5.0495049504950495

I already had a boxed set of Supercar and thought, because I believed Amazon, that this might have been in color or a colorized edition. Sadly, it was not. While it does bring back fond memories of my childhood, I am very disappointed. I'll donate a copy of the series to charity for auction.
