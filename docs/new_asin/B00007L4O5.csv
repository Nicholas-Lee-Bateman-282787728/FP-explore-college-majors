7978078,5,B00007L4O5,"Puppets act out Edgar Allan Poe's The Tell-Tale Heart

This is a wonderfully dark and twisted, not to mention 'punny,' version of the classic tale.  The puppets and effects were phenomenal given the budget.  The voices behind the puppets could have been improved, but all in all this is a delicious little film.

More Puphedz please!!!",1152316800,,335,4.928571428571429
7978079,1,B00007L4O5,"Considering that this won the ""best animation"" award at the 2002 Los Angeles Screamfest Horror Film Festival, I think I had a right to expect something good.  Unfortunately, this 30 (or so) minute short suffers from good ideas and nice sets mixed with horrible dialogue and voice acting.  To add insult to injury, their idea of humor mixes the best of Barney and Sesame Street and applies it to their interpretation of Poe.  As a fan of offbeat, even gimmicky, humorous shows and movies, I am unequivocal in my recommendation to avoid this one.  If you have to see puppets in a humorous context, catch the Muppet movies or even Peter Jackson's Meet the Feebles.",1125964800,,661,4.721739130434782
7978080,4,B00007L4O5,Good production values for an indie.  Needs a little more focus and maybe some different voice-overs.  Can't wait to see a Puphedz interpretation of 'Diary of a Madman' and other classics.,1071100800,,188,5.032258064516129
7978081,5,B00007L4O5,"I encountered the PUPHEDZ at the 2002 Comic-Con in San Diego, and met with the filmmakers during that event.  I must say, I was extremely impressed with what was accomplished on the ""Tattle-Tale Heart"" video, considering what these guys had to work with.  This show was put together with nothing but sheer determination.
The show itself is a silly version of Poe's ""Tell-Tale Heart.""  Like the Thumb videos (""Thumb Wars,"" and ""The Blair Thumb""), this is a fun way to pass a half an hour.  Great for a Halloween party. If, hovever, your tastes slant toward hardcore horror and you have absolutely no sense of humor, this little show probably won't be for you.  It is filled with ridiculous characters, visual jokes, and bad (on purpose) puns.
It also has a good dose of stage blood, but I don't think kids would have a problem with that.  After all, just take a look at what most of them are watching on prime time and in their video games.  None of the puppet characters actually die.  At the end of the show, it's revealed that the ""murder"" scene was all fake.
I would support independent filmmakers capable of doing this kind of work any day.  And I would challenge any detractors to try it themselves.  In some ways, you can tell that ""Tattle-Tale Heart"" is a first episode.  It's a bit rough around some of the edges.  I'm sure future episodes will just get better and better.",1054339200,2,1380,4.565040650406504
7978082,4,B00007L4O5,"PUPHEDZ is a unique blend of puppet wizardry and clever special effects.  It's director, Jurgen Heimann (according to the PUPHEDZ.com web site) honed his skills under the tutelage of effects wizard Rick Baker (founder of Cinovation) and on such films as ""Men in Black,"" ""Mighty Joe Young,"" ""The Nutty Professor,"" etc. etc.
In his first ""stab"" at directing, Heimann takes us on a fresh romp through an Edgar Allen Poe classic in very much the same vein as the Simpsons has already done in one of their Halloween specials. But visually, PUPHEDZ is more like the ""Thunderbirds"" meets the ""The Nightmare Before Christmas.""
Its satirical edge might be blunted if you're expecting to see big budget effects on the order of  ""Lord of the Rings"" (actually, cynic that I am, the time I spent watching the latter would have been better spent watching this PUPHEDZ short six times).
PUPHEDZ isn't perfect, but with a little tweaking it could be. If Edgar Allen Poe is turning over is his grave, it's to get a better look.
A bargain at under $...",1054080000,,1034,4.738888888888889
7978083,3,B00007L4O5,"The jokes are cheesy, but the designs and puppeteering are really good, and If you're interested in that stuff, this is for you. As far as special features go, there are two versions of Tell Tale Heart. One is a little over thirty minutes (somewhat gorey, not scary though), and the other is like twenty-seven or so minutes, and is edited from some of the gore (which there never is a lot of). There is also a documentary about creating the Puphedz, and the people behind them.",1048982400,,477,4.494252873563219
7978084,2,B00007L4O5,"I'm not going to give a long review, because the others are very well thought out and concise.
I will only say that I was under the impression this video was going to be ""creepy"" or ""scary"" or at least maybe a little weird. It was none of the above.
The puppetry (?) was very well done, and the sets and characters were all very cool looking, but it was a far cry from being a horror story, as Poe's original certainly was.
The humor was juvenile and worn. During the parts that were (supposed to be) funny, I found myself shaking my head and thinking, ""Are you serious?""
And the main characters voice... Oh man... It was hard to even watch it, with that guy squealing and whining the whole time...
This would be an excellent movie for a high school literature class to watch, just as a goof. Other than that, I really don't know what else to say about it. Pretty disappointing.",1047340800,3,878,4.327272727272727
7978085,5,B00007L4O5,"Puphedz is the best interpretation of Edgar Allan's work since The Simpsons did The Raven.  If you want to teach your kids about classic literature AND give them nightmares about creepy, murdering marionettes, then order this DVD.
I hope they make more of these.  Maybe the Sci-Fi channel or Adult Swim will pick Puphedz up as a series.",1046822400,2,336,4.775862068965517
7978086,5,B00007L4O5,"Ok, I first heard about this
little film
and felt I needed to check it out.
I purchased it through mail order
from the Puphedz site, and when it came
to my mail box, I took it out,
put the movie on, and had myself a blast.
Puphedz The Tattle Tail Heart,
is quirky to say the least.
In that you will find yourself
laughing at the puns the puppets
err, I mean Puphedz spit out.
It is based on Edgar Allen Poes
The Tell Tale Heart.
It follows the story of two guys,
who share a house together.
The older one, has this hypnotic eye,
which drives the younger guy batty,
and to murder...I will not tell you anymore,
as that might spoil it.
The quality of the transfer is
spot on, with nary any grain,
or artifacting.
The creators have a passion
for their craft, and it shows
through the set designs, and the puphedz
themselves. There is a documentary
showcasing how they did their thing.
Plus the trailers for the movie.
There are two versions of the film,
One is 27 minutes, which is the short version.
The other is 34 minutes.
So if you would like to see puppets bleed
red sap, I suggest you give this a shot.
Or if you love puppets at all, give this movie
a shot, because It's absolutely fun and weird.
If the story grabs your goat, get this.
You won't be disappointed in the least.
Ciao",1040774400,4,1284,4.202429149797571
7978087,5,B00007L4O5,"The first in the Puphedz series is entitled, The Tattle Tale Heart. It's foundation and concept borrows from the Edgar Allan Poe literature, The Tell Tale Heart, and does so in a unique and fascinating way. Instead of creating a straight-forward direct adaptation of the story, the creators have created a world filled with a cast of characters that breach the realms of Oddity. Let's not forget the fact that the Puphedz themselves are hilariously presented. One character that comes to mind shouts out a series of one-liners where you can't help but laugh.
The creators have envisioned this series of stories as a traveling puppet show wherein the Cart Puller carries this contraption on his backside - when he lifts it off his back - the story unfolds.
The people behind the scenes come from many artistical venues, including creator Jurgen Heimann who has worked on over 20 major motion pictures (Planet of the Apes, Men in Black, Gremlins, to name a few.) While associate producer, Jim Kundig, has worked on Bicentennial Man, Godzilla, Independence Day and the list goes on.
Do yourself a favor and watch this DVD. It grows on you -- It's uniqueness and originality really shine when you think about all the hard work these individuals went through to create this movie.
Also, take a look at their web site. The site itself is represented in the Puphedz style. You can also check out the production process along with backstage photos and more information.",1040688000,2,1461,4.871485943775101
