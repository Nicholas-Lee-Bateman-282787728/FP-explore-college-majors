3628873,5,B001HBVE8S,"First of all, I feel sorry for ""Bill from NYC"".  He obviously missed the total joy and levity in traveling with friends through the phenomenal country of Spain.

Second, I have lived in Spain and this show took me back every single week.  The foods they experienced were perfectly authentic and the scenery was phenomenal.  This show is for anyone who truly has a passion for the food and culture of Spain as well as for those who have a curiousity as to why Spain is the center of the global food phenomenon.

This show is truly addictive.  I have watched every episode (all available for downloand now on iTunes) multiple times and can't wait to watch them again.  I have also watched them with the companion cookbook.  You will love this series!!!  Enjoy and buen provecho!",1227657600,5,776,4.605839416058394
3628874,5,B001HBVE8S,"I'm nearly going blind watching this show as our antenna does not pick up PBS very well, but I am still addicted! Don't be fooled by the title ""Spain"". Yes, this takes place in Spain, but it is very much in the format of Mark Bittman's culinary explorations around the world, also aired on PBS. Bittman is a brilliant, self-abasing, mildly abusive food critic for the New York Times, & he is one of the four travelers on this sorta wacky foodie expedition across Spain. No, it's not an insider's Spanish travel guide (though a Spanish actress does join them & offer some bizarre dieting advice), but you're never meant to think it is. They do take some side trips away from food & mussels eaten straight out of the ocean (& wine, so much wine) to do interesting things one can only do in Spain. But mostly it's about eating in Spain & talking about eating in Spain. It might remind you of a college road trip, only with far more fascinating people & a better car (a convertible Mercedes, whereas mine was a Ford Tempo constantly on the verge of dying). Also the food is much better than your college road trips, but the conversation just as meandering & nonsensical & fun. I cannot wait until this comes out on DVD so I can actually see the food & the countryside! Pathetic, yes, I know. I didn't even like Gwyneth Paltrow before I saw this show, & now I think she's just charming & would love to scarf down a paella pan & a plate of french fries with her. We would also need some of that fantastic Spanish wine they keep raving about, & Mark Bittman to make dry assertions, Mario to wax poetic about EVERYTHING, & Claudia to tell us that olive oil cannot possibly make us fat.",1227312000,23,1677,4.378205128205129
3628875,1,B001HBVE8S,"This DVD show is from the PBS series which I have watched and is really not about Spain. Most of the Spain you will see will be zipping by as a background in a moving car. This series is about the fours hosts and their egos. I found most hours of this show the hosts are talking about themselves and their discussion have nothing to do about Spain.

Case in point

Mark Bittman and Gwyneth Paltrow are in the Alhambra. Do they walk around the Alhambra to take in the magic of this place? No and spend a 10 seconds talking about the interior details of the palace. They find a window with a view and then spend most of their time talking about if Gwyneth would in the future write a cook book with Bittman's help. Does anyone really care if Gwyneth writes a cookbook? Does writing a cookbook have anything to do about Spain? Bittman and Paltrow seem not to care how lucky they are to have visited the Alhambra.

Then they go to the gardens and pilfer some persimmons. This is Gwyneth after taking a bite:

""Oh my God, God, God, God, God.""

That's pretty much the kind of stuff she says when she tastes something because she does not have a movie script to explain the how good ""oh my god"" tastes.

This show is about four people that spend hours talking about themselves and you soon realized five minutes into their discussions it has nothing to do about Spain. Most of what you see is host talking about themselves with little about Spain and in the background..

They are good point of the show but is would fit into less than hour.",1227052800,22,1534,4.32404181184669
3628876,5,B001HBVE8S,"I am not sure if it is the players, the setting, the food (or all three) but this series resonated deeply.  It is, without a doubt, one of the best documentaries ever filmed, a masterwork of editing.  First and foremost is Mario - chef, critic, story teller, flirt and gadabout.  Gwyneth (""GP"") offers insight and humor as well as a good appetite. Mark, the reporter, is the perfect foil to Batali and Claudia is the gorgeous dressing on the salad.

Two distinctive elements stand out:  First, they do more than run around gobbling food. They visit sites, investigate history and lore, talk culture and politics and religion AND - the perfect touch - family and kids.  Second, the fantastic meals are not at five star restaurants but in mountain shacks, on the beach, in a smoky underground cooker, over an open fire in a vineyard.  We are introduced to the cuisine of Spain in a unique and mouthwatering way.

The humor is infectious, like when the gals go to the spa and the guys insist they are going to ""work out at the gym"".  Gwyneth thinks the idea is hilariously preposterous and swears she will run through the vineyard naked if they are exercising.  The camera switches from the girls to scenes of Mark and Mario eating, laughing, drinking at one establishment after another.  Both offer running commmentary on the food and the trip as the girls undergo beauty treatments.  Hilarious!

My grade:  A+",1225238400,13,1408,4.717213114754099

I have lived in France (which I love) but never really spent any time in Spain and knew nothing about their food, wine or scenery. This is very good on all levels and is very entertaining.

3628890,5,B001HBVE8S,"I had seen one episode of this several years ago and recently came across it again, I decided to investigate purchasing the series because I adore anything Spain...I am a retired Spanish professor.  I love the 4 people traveling and their humor. Of course, Mario Batali  is a well known chef, and h is down to earth manner and that of his co-stars is refreshing during this 10-week trip.  Besides seeing all of Spain, it brings back wonderful memories of my own travels all over Spain.  Considering it provides 13 hours of entertainment, this set is priced very reasonably.
I own probably 400 - 500  travel VCRs and DVDs, and this set is definitely one of my very favorites..

3628892,4,B001HBVE8S,I really enjoy the show. I think they couldve gone a lot deeper but you gotta stop somewhere. I think Bittman kind of ruins the whole vibe though. Love my new crush Claudia. Gwyneth should chill on the pork. While I liked her I almost think it would have been better with just Batali and Claudia.

I like their banter, the joviality, the witty exchanges the four have. My wife has tried some of the recepies and the food is wonderful.  Having seen the show, getting the DVDs was a no-brainer.

I really don't watch television shows like these to hear the taste of the food be explained in huge detail. I really enjoyed the way it was made to be like you were watching a group of people on vacation. For me, it made it seem more fun. I understand that a lot of people would have liked to hear more about the history and about things like art and architecture, but that's not really what I was watching it for.",1357948800,4,539,4.142857142857143

3628901,5,B001HBVE8S,Saw this years ago on PBS  and then had to buy the DVd for myself and for others. This is a great trip around Spain with 4 amazing people. The foods you will be introduced to by Mario Batali and you get to see him prepare a few dishes as well at some great locations. Then add Mark Bittman a great food critic and then 2 amazing beautiful women in Gwyneth Paltrow and Claudia Bassols. This trip takes you throughout the Beautiful sights of Spain.

We sat down for the first episode, and it's an amazing immersion in Spanish culture with a very real representation of Spain. Gwyneth looks great and speaks fluent Spanish (who knew?!)while giving the novice viewer an insight into the culture without belittling them for not knowing more about Spain. The other cast members are really enjoyable to watch as they weave their way through the Spanish country side, with the exception of Mario Batali. His brightly colored Crocs, and bad haircut are only the beginning of the distraction that he provides throughout the episodes. I highly recommend this video for all Gwyneth fans, and everyone that would like to get a glimpse into Spain, but I feel obligated to warn you that you will want to fast-forward through every word that creepy and annoying Mario utters.",1291593600,2,885,4.906666666666666

3628914,2,B001HBVE8S,"I had such high hopes for this series.  The ingredients looked wonderful.  I've really liked previous TV work by Batali and Bittman.  Spain is one of my all-time favorite destinations, so I even bought a new DVR just so that I could catch every episode when it ran on PBS.  Well, the DVR came in handy as I ended up doing some fast-forwarding once I got used to the episode structure.  Holy cow it was dull!  The banter between the four was irritating and appeared forced.  I guess Mercedes Benz expected a lot of camera time, having provided a couple of high end cars for the show.  We ended up with extended shots of the cars being driven around Spain at really slow speeds.

Anthony Bourdain is the king of food travel TV, and if you caught his Spain episode, you will get far more out of his one hour show than you will get out of the 13 hours of this hugely disappointing durge.",1262044800,5,883,4.303030303030303

They go to places in Spain that probably never had  ever been publicized, or reviewed and show some of the innovative culinary trends, and highlight the foods of the area. I think there is incredible chemistry between the four of them, they're knowledgable, and they don't get too bogged down in one area. The camerawork is great, the whole concept has never been done with this quality before. And the whole thing is allot of fun!

I can only say that for the average person who has an interest for Spain and its culture - you won't find it here.

Sure the 1 star guy has some valid points, but this is just supposed to be an enjoyable ""Road Trip"" through Spain in the yes of these 4 great, interesting and laughable people. Don't take anything too seriously and you will enjoy yourself. Although some of the restaurants they went to were ""world-class"", the focus is not the restaurant, but the food, wine, land and good company.

3628920,2,B001HBVE8S,"In the New York school of culinary hobnobbing, making unfunny and self-referential commentary about oneself and one's self-indulgent foodie experiences passes for polite behavior. When it's done under the guise of a ""road trip"" (in a Mercedes no less) it curiously fans the unrequited travel fantasies of homebound and monolingual Americans. I won't argue that the glitterati here don't know their stuff--they certainly do, and for that they get an extra star--but the blatant supplication to a demographic who doesn't bat an eye at dropping $8,000 on an international eating tour is nausea-inducing.

I am immensely relieved however that the majority of Spain's culinary treasures--including about 90% of the best wine on earth--will remain in Spain due to draconian import taxes levied by the US. All the better for those of us who live here and get it for a fraction of what these guys paid.",1250208000,2,894,5.123287671232877
3628921,1,B001HBVE8S,"""Spain...On the Road Again"" answers the question that did not need to be asked: ""What if we made an ELEVEN (11) hour version of 'Sideways', except instead of having two guys driving around California wine country with two beautiful girls, one blonde and elegant one dark and lively, we instead had them drive around Spain?"" Oh, and what if instead of it being poignant, funny, endearing, touching and frequently hilarious it was instead self-indulgent, meandering, contrived, aimless and annoying? Oh, and rather than them driving around in a charming old Saab junker while eating and drinking in merely very nice restaurants and wineries they instead drove around in a $100,000 Mercedes convertible while eating in only the very best restaurants? And, oh yeah, another difference, they could also endlessly express vague, meandering opinions that, while displaying a lot of experience with wealthy celeb status consumption, were witless and consistently betrayed a Cliff Notes knowledge of the world around them.

Gwyneth Paltrow is rather touching in a vague, beautiful soccer mom kind of way, although the voyeurism of getting to see her in ""real"" life wears thin after a short while, and Mario Batali is just being Mario. Claudia Bassols, the Catalan actress pulled in to give Paltrow a gal pal on the trip, is charming and bravely bears her thankless task of escorting Mark Bittman, the food and wine writer from the New York Times. Bittman, the major flaw in the ""casting"" of this magnum homage to shallow self importance, may have thought that he was channeling a toxic know it all version of Thomas Haden Church's character from ""Sideways"". But mostly he brings to mind Woody Allen's line from""Annie Hall"" when, trapped behind a pontificating self-anointed film ""expert"" while waiting on line he says ""What I wouldn't give for a large sock with horse manure in it!"" My feeling exactly. But instead all I had was the remote to turn off this interminable journey of wandering Hamptons-ites.

Bittman embodies the sort of top of the food chain, know it all, been everywhere and eaten everything, toxic, New York foodie snob behavior that is so insufferable to those who have made their lives outside the realm of Manhattan and Long Island. To every simple joy embraced by others he brings the sulphur if his self regard and baseball card collection of past facts, travels  and meals. Whatever you are doing, whatever you are, whatever joy fills your life, it's just another catalog entry for Bittman. He is a one man de-joying machine, relating everything he encounters to other similar catalog entries in his collection of past snobistic experiences. The program could have featured just Mario, who we know can cook and has an at least entertaining ego, with Paltrow, who is lovely and kind of endearing in her not terribly bright but aristocratic self absorption, and cut the whole thing to ""just"" three hours, mostly of cooking and foods, and it would have been a decent program.

Mario Batali is awfully difficult to watch, he has the personality of a goofy 14 year old.  The Spanish girl has a wonderful spirit which is constantly nipped at by Bittman, a jaded New Yorker along for the ride.

I love this series.  I love it so much that hope one day they decide to audition one of us un-famous people to take along on their next road trip!

I felt like I was on a road trip with a nice group of friends that truly enjoyed each other and their experiences.

It was a once in a lifetime trip for Mario Batali, Gwyneth Paltrow, Mark Bittman and Claudia Bassols.  Their interest, enthusiasm and eagerness to learn from the people who grew, created and cooked local food was infectious.  I don't watch much TV, but I could not wait to see this show on a weekly basis.  Which is why I bought is as I missed some shows and just enjoyed it.

They traveled to places one would normally not get to go. They met people who created food that I've always heard of or eaten but never knew where it came from.  Plus they stopped at cultural places and gave small historical backgrounds on many places they visited.  Mario was the historian, Claudia the interpreter and very smart, Mark was so funny and well versed in food, and I have a new found respect for Gwenyth as she is well read in food, loves food like the rest of us and seems like a very devoted Mom.

You can see some excerpts from the show on line before you buy it.  Check it out, if you enjoy food, it's worth the trip!",1239753600,,1377,4.154716981132076

3628927,5,B001HBVE8S,"Reading the reviews of this show is quite interesting.  It seems that the people who were looking for a cooking show were disappointed.  The same for those looking for a travel show. To me this is a just a road trip with four folks I can identify with taking in the sights, foods, and culture of Spain.

 Mario is the phat philosopher (phat in the Vietnamese sense meaning ""hot, cool, tempting or attractive"" OK, maybe in the other sense too) He continuously wears ugly orange crocks, carries an oversize orange ""man purse"" but proves quite knowlegable on Spanish history as well as cuisine.  He seems to appreciate the down home kitchens as well as starred establishments.

Mark Bittman or Bitty as they call him on the show seems to love life, women and eating.  I've not read his books or columns before but have become a fan of his ascerbic outlook on the culinary scene.

 Paltrow,the non meat eater has an attitude of ""I'm concerned about the plight of animals and don't accept factory farms"" while being able to eat and drink with a panache usually reserved for carnivores.  She doesn't come off snooty about her food choices.

 And Bassols: that lady can eat!  And Laugh!  I find this show enchanting and it's my secret pleasure to fold up on the couch with a glass of wine and watch happy people who appear to enjoy each others company travel in an enchanting land.....bg",1237075200,,1380,4.625514403292181
3628928,1,B001HBVE8S,"This series is definitely a travelogue---a journey into the SuperSized egos of Mario Battali, Mark Bittman, Claudia Bassols, and Gwyneth Paltrow. The episodes are divided thusly: 0.5% food, 0.5% Spanish history/culture, and 99% Battali, Bittman, Bassols and Paltrow endless banter about three things: themselves, themselves and themselves. A tv show about Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie driving through Spain would have been less egotistical, superficial, inane and self-absorbed than this tripe.

It's obvious that Battali wants to be the Dean of Spanish cuisine in America because he can't push Lydia Bastinich and Marcella Hazan out of the Italian spotlight. So he and his gang of egos invade Spain.

Save your time and money. Jose Andres' book and series is a much more informative, entertaining and sincere than this basura (garbage). Andres is the true dean of Spanish cuisine in the US.

PS: if your local PBS station uses this as a marathon for Pledge Week, call them up and tell them you are specifically NOT contributing money to them because you believe in QUALITY programming on your local public television station. That's what I did.",1236297600,18,1148,5.194594594594594
3628929,1,B001HBVE8S,"Surely a good editor would have thrown out most of the material found in these four DVDs and produced a single disc that perhaps would have been passable; but there was no such editor, and thus we are presented with the interminable and repetitive vapidity of four narcissists who have the alleged intention of enlightening us about the food, the culture, and the beauty of Spain; that they would fail in their intention and neither entertain nor illuminate was predictable.

Our guides through this misadventure are a rotund and generally disheveled Mario Batali, a restaurant owner in the States (defined as a celebrity chef); an actress, Gwyneth Paltrow, who does not eat meat unless it comes from a happy bird which has been (preferably) overcooked; Mark Bittman, who may or may not be contributing to the demise of the New York Times, his employer, and whose work includes a book ""How To Cook Everything"" (enough said); and a pretty and bubbly Spanish actress, Claudia Bassols, who competes with Paltrow for the emptiest of heads. All four are obsessed with themselves and little else. Claudia manages to walk about in a bikini while taking a shower, revealing that she is far more attractive when fully clothed; Mario demonstrates his incompetence with many things, including with his golf clubs. Claudia sings, with Mark, while traveling in La Mancha. Neither one should ever sing in public. In all, these four characters utter comments about the food and the passing scenery which are as trite and forgettable as they themselves seem.

Some of the other reviewers who did not like this offering suggested ""Made in Spain"" with Jose Andres, as being a far better and more useful culinary tour of Spain. I agree and recommend it as an antidote to ""Spain...On The Road Again.""",1236124800,13,1780,4.93
3628930,2,B001HBVE8S,"Prior reviews have amply covered the ""self-absorbed, inane banter"" that goes on in this series: hours of ""GP"" talking very proudly in Spanish and gifting us with her childhood memories of Spain before she jets back to the UK for her kids' Halloween. Who cares? Is this a cooking show or what?

The best of these scenes is in Barcelona when Claudia Bassols tries to verbalize some script about how Michael Stipe from REM (who they have pseudo-spontaneously picked up as a ""hitchhiker"") is such a big star in Spain. On cue, a friend of Claudia's appears and greets her as she is puffing up Stipe. The friend doesn't recognize Michael Stipe or Mario Batali as he is introduced by Cladia to each of them. They glumly receive the introductions and then Claudia says adios to her friend and continues on about what a huge, household name Michael Stipe is. Hilarious!!!

This series is a big celebrity ego stroke that, distilled down like a fine rich sauce, would have made a decent travelogue with some cooking elements. As it is, even with the ability to continuously Fast Forward through the non-sense, this show is very distracted in personalities and the fabulous lives of ""star chefs"" and their celebrity friends.

Weird and shallow.

Jose Andres and Made in Spain is a much better show if you are interested in Spain, festivals and cooking.",1235779200,10,1340,4.762931034482759
3628931,2,B001HBVE8S,"Like previous reviewers, I was under-whelmed by the program. There were aspects of the show I enjoyed, such as beautiful images of the countryside and some interesting food. Although this is not a ""follow these steps/America's test kitchen"" type of show, one can gain an insight into the cuisine of various regions of Spain. I also like Mark Bitman, who is one of the more intelligent and thoughtful commentators on food working today in the US. Claudia Bassols does not come across as the brightest bulb in the box, but she is at least decorative.

What pretty much ruined the experience for me were Paltrow and Batali. There are hours and hours of inane and self-absorbed conversation between these two. Paltrow makes comments such as ""if it's progressing it's art"" and harps on about her beliefs about food, in particular her opposition to commercially produced food. These are the inanities of someone too rich and self-absorbed to realize how much poverty and hunger there is an in the world. I also personally found the sight of the enormously overweight Batali, in pink shorts and shoes, stuffing yet more food into himself unappetizing.",1235347200,7,1144,4.958333333333333

They zip through the beautiful countryside in their convertible (who cares about their stupid car--show us some scenery!), don't really present much information about the food and basically, it's all about them instead of the country or the food. I actually hate this show and its traveling egotists and their inane conversations!  If you are truly interested in authentic Spain and its food, watch and/or buy Jose Andres' book/DVD ""Made in Spain"" as it beautifully presents the country's beauty, its people and its wonderful cuisine!",1234656000,15,746,5.008064516129032
3628933,5,B001HBVE8S,"This is a great upbeat road trip. I learned more about Spain than I ever could from a ""regular"" travel show that just showcased a few cities. This is just a peek at many aspects of Spanish life. Mario seems to know a fair bit about Spanish history and places.

I chose the DVD over the book, since here in the middle of the USA there is no way I can get the fresh seafood that seems to be everywhere in Spain. No. they don't give out recipes, but most of what is eaten is described and cooked right in front of you, often with just salt and olive oil. I would have no trouble recreating many of the dishes in this show given the proper ingredients.

This video inspires rather than instructs. From the well-matched personalities to the catchy music, this is entertaining food TV. If you don't want to watch people eating and talking about eating then you won't like this DVD. It's a casual tour with friends, and some amazing tapas!

Hardly any real information about the wineries/wine.  The whole thing was several hours of us watching the 4 of them!  I expected so much more from these talented people.  I didn't realize till now that Mario's ego is as big as he is!

3628935,5,B001HBVE8S,"I hate reality TV, travelogues put me to sleep, and I can only take cooking shows in small doses, but I love ""Spain...on the Road Again"". In this case, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. This is a thirteen-part travelogue/food series that aired on PBS in fall of 2009. Chef and restaurateur Mario Batali, who lived in Spain for several years, provides the sparse narration for a food-oriented road trip through 10 regions of Spain in the company of four famous personalities. Batali is joined by friends Mark Bittman, the New York Times food writer, and Gwyneth Paltrow, the actress. The charming and beautifully-accented Spanish actress Claudia Bassols rounds out the quartet and acts as a translator when the Spanish of the American's isn't up to the task.

Batali has an overbearing personality, but the mixing and (not always) matching of these four people is interesting enough. Often Batali is paired with Paltrow and Bittman with Bassols, but they switch around. Every person is not there for every episode, as Gwyneth Paltrow goes off to be with her family in London or Bittman is off on a book tour. A lot of conversations of dubious significance take place in the Mercedes convertibles that they tool around in, but this gives the audience lots of opportunity to see the countryside. And we do see both rural and urban Spain, touching on every region except the southwestern part of the country. The intrepid travelers take us to where the food is grown, raised, or caught, as well as to the restaurants in which it is served.

We see a lot of the country by car. Though the hosts draw our attention to points of interest, and they get out of the cars and go in some museums, cathedrals, resorts, etc., these are more like teasers than tours of the sights. They offer a lot more detail about the food. We visit expensive trendy restaurants as well as more traditional establishments that look accessible to middle-class budgets. We watch specialty cheesemakers, pastry chefs, and country cooks do their thing. Our hosts make lobster stew with some fishermen on the beach of Menoa. The food really runs the gamut. And it literally made my mouth water every time. Spain offers perhaps the best Mediterranean cuisine at this time, and nothing could be a better advertisement for Spanish tourism.

That's what ""Spain...on the Road Again"" is. It's an ad for Spain. And apparently for Mercedes, given the number of times we see those cars. It couldn't be more effective or enjoyable. The odd combination of personalities, the lovely scenery, stunning architecture, and food, food, food. Great food, even for a semi-vegetarian like Paltrow. (Like me, she eats seafood but not other meat.) I'd hop on a plane to Spain right now if I could afford to. Some of the dishes could be made at home, some couldn't. Sometimes they are explained, but not in the case of restaurant food. If you've seen Mark Bittman's ""The Best Recipes in the World"" series, the format of the food segments is similar. It's just thoroughly enjoyable. This is an hour-long show, but I am always surprised that it ends so soon.",1231113600,3,3112,4.791433891992551
3628936,3,B001HBVE8S,"Spain is the star of this DVD set. It makes you want to go there and try all the food and visit all the places! This a good over view of Spain from a culinary point of view.

Mario Batali is unquestioned chefing talent and is a robust traveler who points out the finer qualities Spanish food delights.  Gwyneth Paltrow who does not eat red meat and only once fowl in the serise. She eats lots of sea food and eats very well as everyone does. Claudia Bassols seems to just have a grand time effervesing though out the whole thing and why not this DVD shows many ideal situations. Mark Bittman's commentary and wit are much appreciated but I think His cooking skills should have been used more. He has a way of simplifying recipes for us mere mortals here in the mid-west USA. After all he is the Minimalist of the New York Times. Bittman cooks only once in the whole blessed thing.

If you are looking for a great overview of Spain's food and culture I would suggest to see Jos Andrs and the PBS series Made in Spain (ASIN: B001690X4M). This takes you to Spain and does a much better job of showing how to cook the food.",1231027200,10,1119,4.268867924528302
