2883675,5,B000S8SDJE,"When I purchased this, I was expecting a documentary of Marc Jacobs in board meetings with Bernard Arnault, all narrated by a monotone, faceless fashion insider.  I was so wrong.

The film travels with Marc behind the scenes of his own label in the US, and then across the pond to LVMH's corporate offices, where he brings his own attitude, creative energy, and down to earth spirit.  It portrays him as a true artist who is very driven, self-critical, and in tune with multiple industries.  Even the commentary is interesting, funny, and unexpectedly objective.  Are there more films like these?!

Any fan of fashion needs this in his or her DVD collection.

2883676,5,B000S8SDJE,"Being that I am an upcoming fashion designer, I was very impressed with the way Loic Prigent did this documentary on Marc Jacobs and Louis Vuitton.  It gave me an excellent into Marc Jacobs' design process and showed me how gifted and talented he truly is!!!",1214352000,,258,4.608695652173913
2883677,4,B000S8SDJE,"I only knew of Marc Jacobs as a designer favored by the rich and famous.  Since I'm not one of them, I never expected to learn much about him other than the ads I see in magazines and browsing his boutiques.

Enter this documentary...Marc Jacobs & Louis Vuitton.  I just expected a video about the Marc Jacobs Label and how the partnership with Louis Vuitton was developed, etc.....  Instead, what I saw was a rich, visual story about a passionate designer who is truly an artist.  One who chooses to use fashion to express his creativity.  OK, so there is a certain amount of marketing and capitalism hanging onto the apron strings of MJ's name.  However, this documentary does show Marc as an artist seeking to get to the next level of his creativity, yet he is seeking to find acceptance as an artist.

MJ is a designer with two major labels, his own and Louis Vuitton.  I got the sense that this man, who is this incredible designer/artist, is in a way caught in the prison of his own creativity. It's one Ready to Wear collection after another.

This documentary is a must see.  It really is a rare glimpse inside the world of MJ - the bonus is a rare glimpse into the creative side of LV as well.",1204070400,21,1202,4.393665158371041

2883680,3,B000S8SDJE,"Good documentary but a little boring.  However, it is good to see Marc at work and you would appreciate the hardwork he puts in his design of simplicity.  Must give credit to this man for his passion for his work.  Wish they show more fashion on this documentary.
I like Marc Jacob's designs and works.",1369353600,,302,4.454545454545454
2883681,5,B000S8SDJE,This documentary shows a very important designer and his work habits.  Very good if you love fashion and are curious about the background work for a fashion show.,1362009600,2,162,4.785714285714286
2883682,4,B000S8SDJE,"'Fashion is just a job,'' Marc Jacobs says in Loc Prigent's documentary about Marc Jacobs & Louis Vuitton. The usually shy Marc Jacobs agreed to this documentary and gave great access to Mr Prignet. Marc Jacobs in this film comes across as a really likable, extremely talented young man. He appears to be a health fanatic from all of the vitmins and minerals and health food he eats. At the same time, you would be hard pressed not to find him with a lit cigarette at all times. His daily schedule looks like a constant grind. In this film we see how Jacobs goes from an inspiration to the commercial product. One fascinating scene shows us Marc Jacobs in a meeting with polka-dot artist Yayoi Kusama. And, soon thereafter we see the candy-colored dots in Vuitton's spring '07 line. In 1997, Jacobs was appointed Creative Director of luxury French fashion house, Louis Vuitton, where he created the company's first ready-to-wear line. An odd coupling, yes, but it has proved to be very successful.

Most of us have heard of Marc Jacobs. Certainly, the young group knows him as the most influential and interesting contemporary American designer. He is slight of build, but beaming with energy, as he eats his protein bars and drinks his bottled water. Everywhere, in every country, bottled water was on the counter, desk, airplane rest and table. You might think in France you would see coffee, or cafe, but, no, the bottled water appears as if in a vision. The film allows us a peek into the design and production process. We watch a roomful of people designing and presenting inspiration boards and collages. Marc Jacobs takes an old acrylic purple sweater from the 70s and inspires a new cashmere version. We see the workshops operating at a frantic pace to get the collection ready.  Seamstresses go without sleep and then an assistant works feverishly to finish a dress and then rides a motorcycle across town with the dress as the show begins.

We get to see Marc Jacobs at art museums buying an eclectic mix of art. The art adorns his walls at his work place and at home. We have a glimpse of his home, very modern and in the Japanese format. He tends to wear casual clothing, tee shirts, they may be hand made, but who knows?  His good friend and business partner, Robert Duffy joins him in many scenes. In 1984, Robert Duffy, then an executive at the Ruben Thomas sportswear company, hired Mr. Jacobs to design a collection called Sketchbook; Mr. Duffy and Mr. Jacobs have continued to work as partners

This is a very entertaining film of the fashion world. The down to earth business of making fashions. Whatever, Marc Jacobs designs, he seems to be a favorite of the rich and famous. We see his famous friends and they fawn all over him, as they would any fabulous designer. But, he is able to maintain his privacy and is always a little bit removed. The people he works with love him, many have been with him for years. Watch for the labels and the name- Marc Jacobs will be with us for a long time to come.

2883683,5,B000S8SDJE,"special note to Marc Jacobs:  Thank you for sharing your life with the public.

The quality of the documentary was phenomenal. He lets the camera into his life showing how he collaborates and creates designs for LV and the Marc Jacobs. The thing that I did learn is how important going to the museums and the art shows are important to him.  The other item that shines is that his team are very happy to work with and for him and that clearly is a component of his success.  Like they say there is no I in Team.

The DVD Includes a bonus track  of approx 62 minutes.

I will never look at his products the same.  Bravo........",1246147200,,626,4.245762711864407
2883684,4,B000S8SDJE,"I think this a must watch documentary for any fashionista, high couture lover, a fan of Marc Jacobs and Louis Vuitton, or simply love watching the creative process behind the scenes in the fashion world.

Marc Jacobs is considered a fashion genius and he not only has success with his own fashion label, but he is also designs for the Louis Vuitton fashion line as well.

This documentary shows what it is like behind the scenes in the high end fashion world. We see Marc Jacobs in the process of creating new designs for his own line as well as for Louis Vuitton. We see how a fashion show comes together. Plus a little bit about Marc Jacobs himself.

The world of high end, fashion design seems to be very stressful. I am not that creative when it comes to fashion or have the artistic eye for creating high end fashion... I am not even sure I understand the full depth of Marc Jacobs artistic talent/genius, but at least I feel this documentary shed some light into the world of high end fashion.",1235606400,3,999,4.448087431693989
2883685,4,B000S8SDJE,im starting to design again and thought I'd check this out.. and am glad I did.  It was pretty inspirational and it was cool to see how one of the greatest designers of our times gets his ideas from.  i actually rented it from netflix first before I bought it.. but I think it's a great collection to have especially if you are a fashion designer!,1227571200,2,347,4.242424242424242

8204780,2,B000S8SDJE,"A filmmaking friend once told me that good movies ""show rather than tell."" I'm interested in Jacobs but much less interested in hearing the filmmaker speak a documentary's worth of Jacobs-related content. The images and edits are admirable, but I was annoyed with the excessive narration from the first moments of the film.",1522368000,,323,5.113207547169812

8204789,5,B000S8SDJE,"never got the fascination w/ marc jacobs works after 2004[? -loved his 1999-2000 collection the best] where the clothes may look good on a somali famine victim but for regular body types, it would make you look dumpy. But this dvd really made me like his work esp the 2008 collection which really looked weird before watching the dvd.

great doc which shows how jacobs is inspired & comes up w/ ideas. Really insane work process. enjoyed the bonus content. really liked the heels in the shape of 0 which i don't think ever went for sale to the public[ i am a guy-so i don't focus on this stuff] but it would cool as a art piece.",1411603200,2,628,4.322033898305085
