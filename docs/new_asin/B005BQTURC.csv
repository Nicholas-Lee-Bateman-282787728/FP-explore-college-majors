4643906,4,B005BQTURC,"I love these kinds of movies.  When I read the first review and saw that it only had 3 stars I was a bit worried I would not like it.
I was surprised.
Sure it maybe seem a bit cliche  but such is life.
I found it was pretty good though I would have liked to see a bit more dancing vs the story line.  That does not mean the story line was horrible.  It was very realistic.
Just give it a chance.  Tune out the world and let the movie/music move you.
I wanted to reach in the movie and hug the two women Carmen and Gina.  Life is not easy for a lot of folks and there are some out there that give up before they've had a chance to show their dance.  So allow yourself to go with the flow of this movie and smile at the end.  I did!",1355616000,,730,3.7254901960784315
4643907,1,B005BQTURC,"25 minutes into this I decided I had enough.  The story sucks, the girl isn't a very good dancer (perhaps she gets better, but I wasn't interested enough to find out as I don't think it would make the movie better) - the lead just seems like a stupid girl who even has a stupid look on her face when she dances - and her best friend is an annoying slutty fat girl who thinks she has an awesome figure and does not help the movie along at all (why is she even in the story?)

There was really NOTHING I liked about this movie.",1349481600,,525,3.9904761904761905
4643908,2,B005BQTURC,The acting and dancing were absolutely horrendous.  The plot didn't make an ounce of sense. I watched the whole movie because I kept hoping that the end would be worth it--it wasn't.  This movie was awful.,1346803200,,205,4.666666666666667
4643909,3,B005BQTURC,"This movie was different than the rest of the dance movies I have seen. This movie doesn't make the dancing important as much as everything else is going on. The dancing is second or even third compared to Carmen's life problems.

Carmen is a 19 year college student. She is supposed to have great dancing skills/talent, but the audience doesn't really get to see her dance.  What we do see is her doing a few steps about 3 or 4 times doing that in the whole movie. In her final performance we get to see her dance somewhat, but when we see it she really NOT that good. She just average dancer or even below average. The camera will cut in and out every time she moves 2 steps and slash in a whole the judes faces being amazed!?! Huh?

In fact, we know how bad she really is by the judges asks her if she gots what it takes and she didn't say a thing. I'm thinking she doesn't know if she gots what it takes because she doesn't dance that much. We don't know if she gots what it takes because we don't see her dance before all this. So, what she does is not answers the judes and she just starts to dance. Shen she finishes her performance, we don't know what happened after? The movie just ends right there?!? Well, if I was the judge for her performance, I would say NEXT!!! Aww, better luck next time!

Now, since Carmen can't dance, the movie was made more about Carmen's life than anything else. We get to see her go to school and get into fights with her teacher and students. We get to see her work at the grocery store. We get to see her fight with her family members everyday. We get to see her workout her problems with her friends and boyfriend. Does she ever dance then? Yup, she does. 2 steps every now and then. Most of the dancing is done by her crew members and other crews. And, when her crew dances, she not even in the battles. She just standing there and just watching her crew dance!

This movie left out two important facts for the audience. The first was did Carmen make it into her dance school? Like I said before. The second thing is that Carmen had problems with her boyfriends and it seemed like she broek up because she wanted to go to her dance school in California. Now for some strange reason he just showed up before she did her big audition. I don't know how he even knew she had a big audition that day. I don't know how he even found out the time and place. Also, what does that mean? They are back together now? So, if she doesn't get into the school, they get back together? If she makes it, they stay broken up? We don't know because the movie never told us because the movie just ended at the end of her performance. So many questions, but no answers!

I gave it 3 stars because I just like the actress. I've seen her in other tv shows and movies and I think she is beautiful. Otherwise, I would had gave this movie a 1 or 2 stars. I don't recommend this movie unless you like the actress.",1337299200,,2929,4.175221238938053
4643910,5,B005BQTURC,"More gritty than glitzy, a true to life story of growing up in the 'hood, of finding one's self, and the dangers of losing it--.  Beautifully filmed and acted.",1319155200,,159,4.482758620689655
4643911,2,B005BQTURC,"""Go For It"" is your stereotypical, hip-hop dance movie. I have to admit, however cliche they may be, I tend to love these kinds of movies. However, this one just fell flat for me. Although the plot was the same as any other (girl loves to dance, girl falls for boy, girl has to overcome some huge obstacle to succeed), this movie didn't do it quite as well as others. It wasn't the acting or camerawork that I had a problem with: It was our so-called protagonist.

It is rare that you encounter such a pessimistic, annoying, selfish character. She acted superior to everyone in her family, and said terrible, judgmental things to her parents. I thought it hypocritical for her to judge her family for not being educated or successful when clearly she was on the EXACT same path herself. It was almost if she expected to get out of her parents' house and make it big, not by hard work or determination, but simply because she thought that the world owed it to her. She had a family who loved her, and time after time she completely disregarded their feelings because she couldn't be bothered to care.

Another issue that I had a problem with was the fact that the audience didn't really understand why her teacher took such an interest in her. She was rude and had a bad attitude. This teacher supported her, encouraged her to be something, and helped her apply into a dance school; all she did was complain and talk about how she didn't have time for this and didn't feel like doing that. (I don't see why not. The audience watched as she quit doing much of anything). She was completely unappreciative of the hard work her teacher put in for her, and was more than prepared to throw away a golden opportunity for NO reason whatsoever.

The last issue that I had with this movie was the fact that we got to see her REALLY dance like once. Even when we did get to see her dance, she wasn't that good. However, the teacher was apparently an expert scout for talented dancers, because he was able to deduce that she had talent after seeing her dance for all of 2.5 seconds. By the final dance scene, I'd had enough and was hoping the protagonist would fall and break her ankle or something. She didn't deserve the spot at the dance school. She would have been perfectly content to work at a grocery store for the rest of her miserable life.

IN CONCLUSION, if you like self-centered, annoying, hypocritical protagonists that can't dance, I would highly recommend this movie for you. I'm sure someone else will enjoy this movie and be able to overlook things I couldn't ignore. If you're not that someone, I would say skip this one.",1317168000,21,2628,4.50314465408805
4643912,1,B005BQTURC,"Well, it's saying something when you can say that the ""Step Up"" movie franchise is actually a masterpiece compared to this movie. Bad acting, poor directing, horrendous dialogue, below average dancing and a whole host of stereotyped characters populate this poorly written dancing melodrama. The dancing is so infrequent and lame that you can't even watch this movie for great dance sequences like you can with the many other dance movies out there.",1466121600,,449,5.164383561643835

4643918,3,B005BQTURC,"Go For It was a slow pace movie about a girl struggling to maintain grades in class while juggling personal family issues and her own passion: street dancing. I wasn't entertained enough to keep a heavy focus on the show, it made great background music. Repeatedly in the movie the main character was given opportunities unlike her peers, but she faced it as any young woman her age would - by making emotional choices. It's realistic, so I appreciated that part of the movie. Ultimately, she gets a happy ending. There's the spoiler.",1457654400,,534,4.752688172043011

4643925,1,B005BQTURC,"I love Aimee Garcia, but it's hard to root for people so filled with anger and hostility. The dance scenes weren't shot very well, too much cutting and closeups. I like to see movement with a group, not bad angles and fast cutting. Aimee's great, but they need to put her in more things that bring out her pleasant persona.",1404345600,,323,4.4

4643930,4,B005BQTURC,"Contrary to many of the other reviewers, I thought this movie was better than most dance movies.  I don't think there was quite as much dancing as in Step Up or You Got Served (but there was more than in Save the Last Dance), but the characters were much more believable and the story was better.  I liked that the characters had flaws, and that in the end the girl didn't get the boy and not everyone got to live happily ever after.  It was a nice change from the typical story of the great guy from a poor family who works really hard and is talented and wins the big contest to get the prize money that makes their life complete.",1379808000,,632,4.163934426229508

4643935,2,B005BQTURC,I love Aimee Garcia. But this movie failed to keep  my interest maybe I've seen too many dance movies. Seems like a rip off Honey and step up,1372896000,,141,4.035714285714286

4643937,1,B005BQTURC,"This was a terrible movie!  The story line wasn't good.  My daughter and I picked this movie.  The story line wasn't easy to follow.  The lead character in the movie stopped dancing, but somehow managed to get an audition at a dance college?  There was a school teacher that was encouraging her and he had his own struggles, but it was never clear what his story was or where he was going.  Her parents appeared to be good hard working people in a tough neighborhood that managed to raise to useless, obnoxious boys that were her older brothers.  Her boyfriend appeared to come from money, but that didn't make any sense considering their school and neighborhood.  It was also unnecessary for her take take her top off and have sex with her boyfriend (with out any consequences).  We fast forwarded through the second sex scene where I think her friend overdosed with her boyfriend.  It was just a useless movie.  No lessons learned from all of the bad decisions.",1363478400,,963,4.6390532544378695
4643938,3,B005BQTURC,"It was not bad, but it is your normal dance movie. The dance battles were pretty interesting. It does seem that the main character in movies like this, really don't know how to dance. Overall, an okay movie.",1363305600,,207,4.473684210526316
