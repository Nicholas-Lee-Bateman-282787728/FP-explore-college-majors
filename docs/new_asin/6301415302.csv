333833,3,6301415302,"This program will indeed stretch you. The stretches are fairly easy while still being effective. It's not too difficult and it's a nice short and to the point program (about 20 minutes). The only drawbacks are the out of date cheezy factor, which isn't really a big deal. Her voice is a tad annoying as she tries to sound breathy and soothing, but doesn't quite pull it off. I don't regret buying it. It does get used but less often then my other stretching/yoga tapes.",1055635200,6,469,4.529411764705882
333834,5,6301415302,I have been working out pretty hard for my upcoming wedding and have over done it quite a few times.  This morning I woke up and my legs hurt so bad I was limping.  I did this video and it was like a miracle.  The pain was gone!  I had to do it again later in the day just because it made me feel so good.  I plan on doing this video before working out from now on.,1050192000,8,365,3.628205128205128
333835,5,6301415302,"What a nice relaxing way to wind down at the end of the day and improve flexability and circulation all in just 30 minutes.  Denise streches every part of your body in the soothing video, a great stress releaser as well!!  As an added bonus my 4yr old daughter just loves to do this with me, she feels so grown up and she can keep up with the slow and easy pace of the streching in the tape,  I would recomend it to everyone who just wants to strech out and relax.",1049241600,7,464,4.021739130434782
333836,4,6301415302,"Good moves and Denise shows proper alignment for each stretch. Excellent video, but a bit too long and Denise's voice is crackly and gravelly. A smoother talker would be nice.",1017187200,7,175,4.866666666666666
333837,5,6301415302,"I have always exercised at home with videos and this one I have also used for over 10 years. Yes, we also need to burn calories and lift weight, but I believe Denise's flexibility and balance challenge offered here is the most beneficial of all. Her form and gracefulness is a goal I strive to achieve. As a 51 years young golfer, biker, hiker and skier, I have so far avoided injury and feel all my sports have improved.  Flexibility is a must for life.  Start now with this relaxing video. You'll feel great! I am ordering gifts for friends today.",975369600,23,549,4.425742574257426
333838,5,6301415302,I have used this tape so much I have worn it out and am ordering another one.  The tape is easy to follow and only takes about 20 minutes.  Moves from standing stretches to floor work with ease.  Worth the money.,957916800,10,212,4.121951219512195
333839,1,6301415302,She does not give clear voice instructions and the camera gets so close to her body that you cannot see what she is doing.,947808000,6,122,4.125
333855,5,6301415302,"Had this thru my 20's and 30's. used it almost every day to keep my body healthy. Finally wore it out and have tried others but don't like any of them. This is great to do on it's own or after a work out. Everybody should do this everyday. I wish Denise would put these on dvd and sale them. I am glad I found this as I will now transfer to dvd and hope it last till my death. Thanks Denise, you are the excercise guru.",1365379200,,419,3.8275862068965516
333856,3,6301415302,"This video was my favorite stretch tape back in the day, and I was thrilled to see it still available, if second hand.  The product I received had a ""wobbly"" video, but perfect audio, and I recall now that my original tape had the same affect, despite any tracking adjustments I might make.  So, I accepted the fact that this late-80s VHS just wasn't a very well produced video, but still a fantastic workout....until I experienced a series of repetitive ""black out"" moments about 15 minutes into the tape, and very frequently thereafter, particularly after minute 22.  Not being able to check her changes in position or new moves detracts greatly from the experience!

I am returning this for a refund, for which I expect no problem, but noted in the process that this workout was re-released (also on VHS) in 2002, and I am going to try it again!  Maybe these problems will have been resolved; I can live with the wobbly-ness, but not the black outs.  The workout is really worth it, but I advise the seeker to try the re-released version and maybe we'll both have good luck!",1295136000,3,1077,4.612565445026178
333857,5,6301415302,"i had this vhs a long time ago and my dog ate it. Since then I have been looking all over the place for this video! Was so happy when i found it on here. I love this stretch and flex video. Have tried many others in the past, but none compared to this one.",1278460800,2,256,3.672727272727273
333858,5,6301415302,"I started with this stretch routine when I was in highschool. It has been my best stress reliever through college, then marriage, then motherhood. I basically have the whole routine memorized, which is good since I no longer have a VHS player. Even so, I wish I could find this routine on DVD.",1244678400,3,293,4.547169811320755
333859,5,6301415302,"Remember back in High School Health Class where they told you that the three major fitness component were Aerobics, Muscle Toning and Flexibility?  There are plenty of videos out there that take care of the first two... but not the flexibility.  I have been using this tape since in came out in 1993.  It came out before the big Yoga and Pilates fad really hit. I have had to replace it several times.  It is the best tape for stretching I have yet to find.  It's easy and can be used no matter what your fitness level or age.  It's only 30 minutes so not overly lengthly. There are very few difficult yoga-like poses.  The ones that are featured are challenging enough and can be done with a little practice.  Denise uses a calm voice and gives lots of tips for better form and encouragement without being over the top.  The colors & lighting of the background along with the ""new age"" music helps to relax your mind and your body.  Do this 3-4 times a week and you will notice a differnce.",1219622400,,991,4.366120218579235
333860,5,6301415302,"Denise's Stretch and Flex video is one of my long-time personal favorites -- and I'm a Yoga instructor with twelve years of teaching experience.  This is definitely my ""stretch of choice"", and I'm on my third copy of this video after two others wore out from years of constant use.  The stretches are challenging enough to work, and more importantly, Denise stretches the entire body in sequence, going from head to toe so that no muscle group is ignored or glossed over.  Years ago, I ran into a fellow Yoga instructor at Starbucks, and both of us admitted to doing this video on a regular basis.  We agreed it was a ""guilty pleasure"".  I've ordered this video for my daughter and for friends, and it's traveled on vacation with me all over the U.S.  Many of these stretches ARE Yoga-based, but Denise's no-nonsense approach to them makes them accessible and do-able.",1154476800,4,868,4.71523178807947
333861,5,6301415302,"I use this tape about 3x's a week. I love it!!!! 30 minutes of pure stretching. This tape is so relaxing. There is no loud music and she's not hollering and running her mouth. Don't get me wrong,
I dig denise, but sometimes she can be a little loud.
Overall, you will feel your body within a few months.",1071100800,7,303,4.1525423728813555
333862,4,6301415302,"I purchased this tape from Virgin Mega music store. I reviewed it couple of times, just to  make sure it was not a yoga or pilates tape.
Yesterday I did this tape before going to bed, and after a very on long day... I woke up feeling good. I have decided to do this day 5 nights a week before a hot shower and hitting the bed.
I am going to incorparate it into my other fitness goals.
It's very important to stretch and this one appears to be a winner for me!!!!",1063065600,5,462,3.967741935483871

7812519,5,6301415302,My favorite Stretching routine ever!  I have searched and searched for years to find it on DVD and can't :(  I wore out my over 20 years old tape.  I am buying this one again to hopefully get it transferred on DVD so at least I can still do it.  I don't why they don't make all VHS in DVD.,1422576000,,289,3.7666666666666666
7812520,5,6301415302,I don't have a VHS player anymore.  Why can't this be re-released in a DVD format?  It is unparalleled no matter how many stretching DVD's I go through. My favorite through the 90's and now I can't watch it.,1421625600,,207,4.282051282051282
7812521,5,6301415302,Have had for years.  Lost my first tape in a move to a new house last year. Had to buy another. Looked for it on CD but could not find it. Just VHS but still purchased.  Easy to follow and your body feels so good after stretching out.,1401926400,,234,3.8541666666666665

My wish is that it would come out on CD so I don't have to squeeze myself between the bedroom furniture to do it. Beyond that, perfect.",1370044800,,320,4.079365079365079
