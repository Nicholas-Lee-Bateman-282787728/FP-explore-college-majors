2754400,5,B000N3SRPE,"I watched this first time round growing up in England around 10 years ago.  When it was first released on DVD in the UK, I tried to bide my time hoping it would be released over here.  It didn't work, however.  I caved and bought it once about a year ago in Region 2 format and had to watch on my laptop, and am buying it again in Region 1 format now that it's been released over here--it's that good.

Like many classic comedies some of the sketches fall flat, but when it works, it REALLY works.  Of those that immediately spring to mind, Ming the Merciless at home in his suburban townhouse, and The Artist Formely Known as Prince stalking his prey in the African savannah never lose their appeal.

The second season doesn't quite reach the heights of the first, although there are many gems in there too.  For a sample, try You Tube, but to witness the entire thing, as intended, you need to buy the DVDs.

Also known as the show that launched Simon Pegg's (""Shaun of the Dead""; ""Hot Fuzz"") on the world.",1187827200,5,1008,4.324468085106383
2754401,4,B000N3SRPE,"I had the pleasure of watching the first season while living in England.  I laughed soooo hard at some of the skits that they stuck with me in the back of my head up to the day I ordered them!!  So, my excitement that I could relive that by buying the dvd in America was overwhelming.  I was waiting by the mailbox like a child.  After seeing it all again, I am still verrrrry much pleased with the first season, but the second season was a bit disappointing.  (only my opinion)  Seriously, though, if you like quirky british humour and you have an open mind, you will LOVE the first dvd!!  There are some skits that I think are so well written and so effin hysterical, i have literally found myself thinking of them in daydreams and laughing all over again.  i appreciate the minds that came up with this.",1183852800,4,806,4.326666666666667
2754402,2,B000N3SRPE,I can't believe that they compare this to Little Brittain and The Catherine Tate show which are hilarious.  Big Train may have a few funny moments but really not that many.  I was left wondering if there was something wrong with me after watching this as I usually find humor even when most others do not.  This was not worth the $25.00 cost.  I would say that even $6.00 ish pushing it.  British comedy is much better than this one.  Save your money for Catherine Tate when it comes out on DVD here.,1182988800,,500,4.32258064516129
2754403,4,B000N3SRPE,"Please note first that the listed product details are wrong.  This is a region 2 DVD, and consequently WILL NOT PLAY ON AMERICAN DVD PLAYERS.  As far as I am aware, Big Train has never been released over here.  That said, if you have a multi-region player, this is one of the funniest sketch shows released in years.  Similiar in format and approach to Monty Python, the Big Train team delight in juxtaposing the ridiculous with the everyday--the sketches of Ming the Merciless at home and, later, being visited in hospital by his friend being classic examples.  As with Monty Python, however, the sketches are pretty hit and miss.  While some border on genius, others will just leave you with a puzzled expression on your face.  The quality also dips towards the end of the series, as if all the best ideas were exhausted early on.  That said, there are plenty of gems here, and once you've watched both series, the inclusion of a scene select feature means you can also go back to just the ones you want.",1146268800,6,1006,4.581005586592179

Big Train is cute, funny and worth the time to watch.

You see a ton of famous English actors and actresses.

8174416,5,B000N3SRPE,This is a rocking cool show that is so much better than some of the trash that we get in the US. If you love sarcasm and wit than this will make you laugh but if you like serious shows this might not suit your needs.,1362528000,,216,3.717391304347826
8174417,4,B000N3SRPE,"If you like British sketch comedy like Monty Python, Armstrong & Miller, Mitchell & Webb, then I recommend Big Train. Really excellent troupe of actors including Simon Pegg, Catherine Tate, Mark Heap, Julia Davis, etc. Only 2 seasons, but absolutely worth it! Certain sketches are so ridiculously surreal (jockeys stampeding through Africa, ""Something must have spooked them!"") that I wonder the series didn't continue for longer. Of course, this came out right about the time that Pegg and Heap went off to do ""Spaced,"" so that could certainly explain it!",1361232000,2,556,5.188888888888889
8174418,5,B000N3SRPE,"Big Train only ran for two series but established itself as one of the funniest shows ever made in a very short space of time. A classic post Python sketch show, that was competing with serious heavyweight comedies in the UK like the The Fast Show and Little Britain, and the end, in my view, was better than both.

The surreal nature of some of the sketches is what makes the show so great. One sketch that always stuck in my mind was the wildlife film with the couple getting on to the roof of their Land Rover as a stampeding 'herd' of Jockey's swept past.. But there were many others just as good and some even more surreal. They were all beautifully acted by a stellar cast. Remember this is a series that had Simon Pegg and Catherine Tate to name but two.

Then of course there was the World Stare Out championships. A truly inspired idea, and to get Barry Davies in to do the commentary with one of the cast was the icing on the cake. How the writers thought that two animated characters staring at each other, in a psuedo sports arena, could be funny is completely beyond me. The fact that they were right, and produced one of the most original pieces of modern comedy is even more to their credit. I wonder how many takes they had to do each time?

If you missed these shows the first or second time round then this double DVD set is worth getting (theres some nice extras), and if you did see the show the first time round you'll know you have to get it!",1195776000,5,1464,4.258992805755396
