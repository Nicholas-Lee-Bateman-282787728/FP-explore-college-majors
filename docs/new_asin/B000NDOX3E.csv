2766989,5,B000NDOX3E,"this documentary provides a close view of German occupation policies in France and the varied response of the
french to the occupiers.  Ophuls is careful not to editorialize, rather he lets the occupiers and occupied speak for themselves.the picture isn't pretty and the film is controversial but well worth the time.  I rate it five star.",1354665600,19,339,5.035714285714286

2766991,2,B000NDOX3E,"As the description says, this film did cause a scandal when it was released.  It does contain valuable documentary material but like his documentary about Northern Ireland, Ophuls, through his selection of interviews, portrays the issues as a class struggle.  Middle class and wealthy French people are generally shown as having sympathized with the Germans while working class French people are portrayed as the brave victims who fought against them.  In the early 1970's, Ophuls traveled to showings of the film in the U.S. with Susan Sonntag and discussed the film with the audience.  The major view of the film, in the press and elsewhere, was that it was about French collaboration with the Germans but this was before Marxim became popular amongst college students about a decade later and the class argument in the film seems to have been overlooked, obvious as it was.  His film about Northern Ireland shows Catholics as being poor and noble and Protestants as being middle class, nasty and fanatical.  I lived in Ireland at that time and that's not how I remember it.  Most of the Marxists I've known have been from privileged backgrounds.",1348704000,7,1148,4.979057591623037
2766992,4,B000NDOX3E,The film is very very good. Sometimes the image stops a bit and then it continues. What is a a pity.,1335657600,,100,3.8095238095238093
2766993,5,B000NDOX3E,"Marcel Ophuls documentary movie, purchased at Amazon, that investigates the French complicity with the Nazi regime's crimes caused a major scandal in France when it was released. It remains a forgotten masterpiece that still rings with its courageous and trenchant observations.",1332288000,13,278,5.804878048780488
2766994,5,B000NDOX3E,"""The Sorrow and the Pity"" makes you glad you are not French and pity those that are. This is not entertainment. Seeing the film is like reading a non-fiction book. Most of it is interviews are with many who remember the German occupation of France 1940-1941. France had declared war on Hitler's Germany when the Nazis invaded Poland. The French had declared war, then sat waiting for something to happen. Once Poland was defeated, something did happen. Germany invaded France. After only a few weeks, France surrendered. Two-thirds of the country was occupied and the rest more or less a Nazi ally. Recalling those years, one gathers from the film that most of the French accepted what they believed could not be changed. Germany controlled almost all of Europe and Britain seemed certain soon to fall. Many scorn those who collaborated, although they had little choice. What I kept wondering is how their countrymen view the Germans and Japanese who collaborated when their countries were occupied. This is a film that makes you think. What if? What if Hitler had not been defeated? Of course, he was, and it is a pity to see how the French treated each other after liberation. It really is sorrowful.

2766995,5,B000NDOX3E,"'The Sorrow and the Pity' is a monumental documentary concerning French collaboration and accommodation during the Nazi occupation of France. It provides a fascinating window into the lives of normal people swept up in traumatic events. I do not want to color anyone else's viewing with my interpretations. I will just say that this is not a romanticized/sanitized version of events. In the face of overwhelming force many people did what they needed to do to survive and provide for the survival of their loved ones. Some did what they had to do to prosper under the new regime.

Any one with an interest in history or the human condition under duress would be well served by watching this film.",1316044800,38,696,4.8

Except for Albert Speer, none of the leaders of Nazi-Germany on trial in Nrnberg for their crimes against humanity felt any guilt. The analogy to our present crimes against the creation (our destructive exploitation of nature and triggering global warming) is obvious. This documentary provides valuable data for Gerald Edelman's Theory of Neuronal Group Selection that might help us find ways to counteract our irresponsibility.",1253491200,,790,8.753086419753087
2767027,3,B000NDOX3E,"It was a pity that this movie, which is a description of French duplicity after the war, was sadly short of the counterpunctual argument.",1481846400,,137,4.75
2767028,5,B000NDOX3E,"What an amazing video. I've read many books on WWII but this video showed me a lot of what I don't know. Very intense. Unless you understand French you will need to put subtitles on. The DVD doesn't have that option so your player will have to do it. This is the type of story that you can't miss a single word. The video shows original clips from the 40's and interviews the people in the 60's to ask them personal questions about the occupation of France and the reasons why Germany had support from some of the French people. I couldn't believe that the French people had so much hate towards Jews and outsiders. The documentary shows how they were ""ripe"" for the Nazis. I found the German soldiers were arrogant in the interviews. Always a smirk on their face. To me the story builds and by the second half I couldn't stop watching it. It is a long documentary, I think about 4 hours. I could easily watch this again but I would have to watch it alone as nobody would sit through it with me. You really can't have any interruptions whilst watching this. I checked this out from my local library but would love to own it.",1480636800,,1124,4.331753554502369

It illustrates mercilessly the sad reality of the nation's vast majority of traitors and collaborators, as opposed to the post-war official legends of ""Resistance""...In fact the movie (commissioned by the ORTF - the French State TV) was kept hidden in a drawer for almost 20 years by the authorities afraid (as usual) of the bitter truth...Ultimately the French had to come to grips with their past sins, and this film was a major contribution on this thorny way!",1477180800,4,573,4.857142857142857

2767072,5,B000NDOX3E,"Some reviews complained this film was in French (in fact there are also scenes in German), but if you look into the setup of your DVR player, there is a subtitle function available.  Don't miss out on that because the film will run in French automatically.  This is indeed an interesting film with great WWII footage.  The interviews with citizens who chose to side with the Vichy government as well as those who chose the Resistance offer a great opportunity to study a particular area of France and the affect WWII had upon it.  I also found the viewpoints of some German officers to be revealing.  One of them stated that while Hitler felt that France would offer no serious opposition to the Reich, German officers felt the French army would fight quite hard as they did in WWI and that it would be a long, hard battle.  The planting of roses by French women along the Maginot Line to make it ""look pretty"" was ironic.  This film is a must see for any WWII buff.

2767073,5,B000NDOX3E,"For every Albert Camus who joined the French Resistance, there were 10,000 Frenchmen who supported Petain. This harrowing documentary confronts the brown-shirted ghosts of the Occupation, and, by doing so, makes the heroism of those who fought against their own turncoat government more amazing and inspiring. See this movie--preferably without popcorn or beer. Everyone needs to face the truth of WWII when so many in Europe saw Hitler as a bulwark against bolshevism rather than what he was: Evil incarnate.",1364428800,27,509,5.375

2767075,5,B000NDOX3E,"For WWII history, this shines!  It presents a truer picture of the dichotomy of France's positions without apology, than I expected.  Perhaps intervening years led to less fear of reprisal and, therefore, greater honesty.  The Vichy supporters can do no more than present their shallow reasons for compliance and live the rest of their lives with a warranted burden of guilt instead of the sorrow that would provoke abject pleas for forgiveness.  There remains a sense in them of being justified by the 'difficult' personal, family or economic circumstances war with Germany entailed for them.  Truly a pity!",1362873600,10,608,5.163265306122449

This documentary film is a valuable historical record to accompany any historical reading, especially now that most survivors of WWII France are gone. Interviews range from collaborators to members of the French Resistance, from ""common folk"" to leaders, and newsreel footage is interspersed for context. The value of this masterpiece is only strengthened by the courage it took to make it several hours long. Every minute is worth it. This film makes it clearer than ever how the holocaust could happen -- how it involved passive acceptance by so many throughout Europe -- how it was possible for the Nazis to have concentration camps in Paris and in Holland (something that I don't think was known when the film was made.)",1484179200,2,763,4.96875
