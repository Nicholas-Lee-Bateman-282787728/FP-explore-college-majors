8278286,5,B000TV4PWO,"Yup....Once again we step in the mind of Charles E. Cullen. This movie is absolutely horrifyingly hilarious and kept me watching through the whole movie. Don't listen to the other people, this is low budget, but I didn't want the over produced, over commercialized run of the mill Hollywood picture. This is a must buy for your Charles Cullen Collection.",1250121600,,354,4.916666666666667
8278287,1,B000TV4PWO,"dont even think about buying this movie. it makes no sense, the graphics/ make up fx are the worst. the ""bats"" are actually plactic toy rats with papers wings glued on. one scene the mayor cuts his finger off, the next scenes he has the finger again. horrible.",1201478400,,260,4.4375
