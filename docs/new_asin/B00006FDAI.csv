1745279,3,B00006FDAI,"Personally, I would love it if the characters spoke in a correct grammatical manner, but in real life there are many adults who cannot do that, so it would be unreasonable to expect child characters to do so. ( Besides, children watching the film probably would not notice, or be bothered if they did .)
Also, correct me if I am wrong, but I always thought that Ducky was female, so Cera is not the only girl in the group.
I enjoyed the film, but I think my favorite so far is "" The Big Freeze "" : I have a soft spot for Spike.
I am looking forward to number ten "" The Great Migration "" coming out in this country, though I do not know when that will be.",1082678400,,654,4.0
1745280,1,B00006FDAI,"1)to behave just like Cera (or in other words--like a brat) 2)to head-butt (think: younger sibling) and, 3)to used improper English (""me want...""). I had to pull the plug on this movie after I figured out where my 3 year old was picking up these annoying, new habits. She, and I'm sure others, thought the dinosaurs were cute--I beg to differ. Cera is quite negative and bratty and also happens to be the only girl dinosaur in the movie--hmmm. Probably a so-so movie for kids that aren't affected too much by what they watch but I would think twice before purchasing it for an impressionable child.",1051056000,14,598,4.650943396226415
1745281,2,B00006FDAI,"I've enjoyed the eight previous Land Before Time adventures, but not this one. Rent it before you buy it. I'm glad I did. I feel the animation and dialogue are not as good as others, the voices are different and more irritating, and Cera is more negative than usual. I realize that this review is also negative and may not get many helpful votes from readers...but really, I'm not criticizing just to criticize. Rent before you buy.",1042416000,24,432,4.623376623376624
1745282,4,B00006FDAI,"This series has its up and downs as we are into 6 or 7 different iterations of the land before time. Gladly, my kids LOVE this one. Dont hesitate if you have a child who loves the series.",1041379200,,187,3.9473684210526314
1745283,5,B00006FDAI,"I would never have, by any measure, thought these movies would be worthwhile. But my 3 year old loves all of them. He has his favorites . . . going back to The Great Adventure and the Big Freeze. But he wanted Journey to Big Water as soon as he saw it advertised. And as he watched it the first time, he got the threat of danger and suspense involved which, of course, went right past me. He had many comments and breath-taking moments and has watched it at least once a day since. He is very involved with the adventures of his favorite characters once again. Plus he really liked the new characters, Mo and the menacing Sharp Tooth Swimmer.
I'm happy to be able to give my son cheap entertainment like that. If only he could watch Land Before Time Live, his life would be complete! Seriously though, he was just as or even more fascinated with the movie as he was with The Lion King on Broadway show, and that trip cost a small fortune. He loves the TV games included, the sing-a-long songs, the JumpStart Video . . . everything! Sooooo ... I give it 5 stars because he is totally engaged and entertained.
The music isn't that drippy and inferior, either. I mean, you would think that the 9th in the series would be BAD, but it's really not. I guess I'm easy to please too, but the music is alright. Plus, I like the Donny Osmond song at the end so much that I am considering buying his CD. And that is amazing, considering I'm not an Osmond fan by any stretch of the imagination. So there you have it. Buy the DVD for your preschooler and let him have a ball, and know that there are a few touches for adults too.",1040169600,17,1616,4.233009708737864
1745284,1,B00006FDAI,Please stop these horrid cheapquels. The animation & songs are increasingly horrible with each sequel. The original movie in this series is a classic (which I'd buy in a heartbeat if it was offered in widescreen). As soon as Don Bluth passes away he will begin turning over in his grave. Children over the age of 5 (unless they have had a lobotomy) will leave the room if you put any of the sequels in your dvd player.,1036972800,6,418,4.371794871794871

1745564,3,B00006FDAI,"If you're like me, then you are a fan of the original Land Before Time, which introduced us to a world that was both grim and gritty while still having a cute and charming side. It was as deep and thought provoking as a 'kids' film could be.
Then came the sequels.
Everything was suddenly dumbed down, presumably to reach a younger audience for some reason.
The sing-a-longs and often overly light plots of the continuing series certainly took its tole on the quality, and none of the subsequent movies ever reached the original's masterpiece status.
However, they were not all horrible.
I take this film as an example of a good point in the series; indeed, it was the best one sense Land Before Time 2.
This film brought the series closer to the original's sense of adventure and peril than perhaps any of the other movies did. While the next movie after this one was still fairly good, that was the last one. The sereies promplty went to heck-in-a-handbasket  and has yet to recover.
But still, feel free to enjoy this film.",1295913600,,1026,4.576086956521739
1745565,3,B00006FDAI,"I bought this movie because my son has become obsessed with Land before Time. I got tired of watching the same 2 over and over again so I ordered about 5 different ones.
Well in this one there is flood which brings in some new creatures from the Big Water that the valley has never seen before. They meet a new friend Mo who like a colorful dolphin? I find him and his voice extremely annoying, does my son no, but boy do I! Of corse Little Foot wants to help his friend back to big water, but the adults say no. So they go off to see Mo and their is an earthquake. So in this one they actually have no choice to but to find a way around the land break to get back to their families. On the way they take Mo back to big water and meet an under water sharp teeth. So the only thing I like about this one is that they technically did not run off from their parents like in ALOT of the other movies!! But I just find the fish annoying.",1288828800,,932,3.9105263157894736

1745609,5,B00006FDAI,"A six year old's review.

Out of the six Land Before Time Movies that I own, this is the best.  Mo was very funny and he liked to have fun.  I bought this movie with the ""Big Freeze"" double feature and ""Journey to Big Water"" is definately better.

I also did not like ""The Adventure That Started It All"".  ""Journey to Big Water"" was better than this movie also.  ""The Adventure That Started It All"" did not have very bright colors.

I love the Land Before Time so much because I like dinosaurs.",1148169600,,494,4.247311827956989
1745610,3,B00006FDAI,"My two year old son loves this movie. He wants to watch it all day long. He really gets into it, and loves the songs, as well as the characters. The colors are better than in the original Land Before Time movie, but the story line lacks a little. I found the characters to be good. I still have a problem with ""sarah,"" as she is a whiny little snot most of the time. Just like in the original. Anyway, your kids will love this. Yes, to us adults it is cheezy, and predictable, but it wasn't made for adults. Your kids will love it. Heck, I am a cop, and I have found myself whistling some of the songs while on duty.",1128816000,,616,4.016260162601626
