I ordered the entire set to save on shipping costs if I ordered them separately.",1392249600,2,184,4.575757575757576
5818676,5,B00DIKJZ3W,"I would recommend this for any Comfy Couch fan.  My daughter is a fan of the ""original"" series with Allison Court as ""Loonette"" the clown however this complete collection contains the last three seasons as well which has a different actress playing Loonette.  She will watch those too although she watches the first four seasons more regularly.  It is great value for money compared to trying to buy all the episodes via retail.",1389398400,5,428,4.835616438356165
5818677,5,B00DIKJZ3W,"I bought this for my niece and she just loves it,..she is also 20yrs old. She watched this program when she was little and it was the only thing she asked for as a christmas present...couldn't say no",1388707200,14,199,4.2631578947368425
5818678,5,B00DIKJZ3W,"This was a gift for my daughter who became a fan when she was two and I bought her a VHS tape from the thrift store for 50 cents.(Yes, we still have a working VHS player) I was happy to buy the whole series for this price. Everything was received in good condition. WARNING: I would not buy this unless the show has already been seen and liked. It's a quirky show.",1388361600,,364,4.069444444444445

5818686,3,B00DIKJZ3W,"The movies were great, or the ones that play anyway. Atleast 2 of the seasons were scratched from being loose in the cases during shipping. However, the quality of the ones that DO work is amazing!",1453248000,,197,4.5
5818687,5,B00DIKJZ3W,"I loved this show growing, so I purchased these for my niece, she loves it! It makes me so happy to pass down this amazing children's show. they don't make them like this anymore. Shipping was earlier than expected!",1452643200,2,215,4.538461538461538
5818688,5,B00DIKJZ3W,"I grew up with this Canadian show. It was Mt absolute favorite show. And one day I woke thinking, ""I want to watch Big Comfy Couch....."" Because I live in the US (and because its really old) I couldn't find it anywhere. Anyways, this show is absolutely cute. It teaches you so much. It is funny and cute and understandable. Doesn't make kids feel stupid like lots of kid shows. I would rate this 20 stars if I could. $60 for the entire series is definitely an amazing deal! eBay is selling it for $120 I believe. BUY IT!!!!",1445644800,2,523,4.292929292929293

5818691,5,B00DIKJZ3W,im just excited to have all the entire season,1421971200,,45,4.111111111111111
5818692,5,B00DIKJZ3W,I was thrilled to find the whole collection. I already had 3 single VCR episodes.  Finding the whole collection has brought hours of excellent learning and entertainment to my grandchildren.,1421107200,,190,5.333333333333333
5818693,4,B00DIKJZ3W,Okay so I bought this gift for my mom who loved this show as a kid. The product arrived on time and everything was all in one piece. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I am OCD and the 6th season DVD box does not match the rest of them. Other than that I am very happy with this purchase.,1420761600,,300,3.703125
5818694,5,B00DIKJZ3W,Amazing,1410652800,,7,7.0

5818696,2,B00DIKJZ3W,"Hello.  I tried to let you know that two of the discs had static & one wouldn't advance properly.  I couldn't find a way to contact until now.  My son has autism & I'm afraid perfection is a thing with him.  If you could replace Season 6 (it was on disc 2) I think he would be satisfied.  We have already purchased a replacement for Season 3 (I think that is the one). That one had a problem with advancing.

The quality of the recording is great & he loves Loonette.  We will be very happy with a replacement of Season 6.",1398556800,,522,4.0588235294117645
5818697,1,B00DIKJZ3W,"There are 2 things wrong with this set:

1. Seasons 1,2,3,4,5 & 7 all have blue spines while season 6 has a white one! This makes it look very awkward when you put them in order because your eye keeps looking at the white one in all the blue. It sticks out like a big white thumb.

2. (And most important) It is not the complete series! Even though they, obviously, state it as having all the episodes it doesn't! Here is a list of some of the episodes that are NOT included in the set:

I Keep My Promises
Lots To Doodle Do
Wait Your Turn
Honest To Goodness
Dustbunny Dreams
When It's Winter

And those are only the ones I have on VHS that I noticed it didn't have, it may have even more. When I contacted them about this question and asked if maybe some episodes were renamed they replied back with a ""We have no information on the product. All episodes are listed."" Making it sound like it was MY fault for not double checking and making sure the product THEY are selling is actually what they advertise it to be. And, as I'm sure you noticed, they don't have every episode listed. Season 7 just says 'every episode' and does not list what is on the set. So I will list it now.

Season 7:
(Disc 1)
Apple of My Eye
Dat's Da Law!
Fibberish Gibberish
Slow Down, Clown!
Floppy!
Clown with A Frown
Rub-A-Dub

(Disc 2)
Upside Down Clown
The Clown Promise
Lost & Found Clown
Phony Baloney
Ready, Steady, Go!
Happy Mirthday, Granny!
Popcorn-Y

(Disc 3)
Peek-A-Boo
Ouch
Big Blow Hard
Shh, Shh, Shh Quiet
Freeze, Please
Clown in the Round
Molly's Bellybutton
Just Purrfect

I have tried to look up information to see if they were just renamed (Like I noticed the episode Comfy + Joy is renamed Comfy and Joy) but I have found nothing out yet. Are they just renamed? I don't know and Amazon isn't much help.

This is just what I noticed. So be warned!",1398038400,9,1843,4.2881844380403455
