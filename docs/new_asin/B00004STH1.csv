1348630,2,B00004STH1,"Being a fan of Kerouac,Ginsberg,Burroughs,et al. I was very psyched to see this documentary. In the beginning (the first 45 mins. or so) this  documentary succeeds very nicely.  For this reason only I have given 2  stars.  However, the main distraction and failing of the piece is the use  of many celebrity cameos.  Depp,Hopper, and other modern luminaries pop-up  from time to time to recite (long!)key passages from the novels and poetry  of beat all-stars.  Where a voice over would of sufficed, the audience is  instead treated to these luminaries looking very intense (beat?) as they  mouth the words like sacred script and occasionally (as in the case of  Hopper ""performing"" Burroughs) even feel the need to channel the  spirit of the beat star by imitating vocal mannerisms and tics.  The effect  is annoying and not at all enlightening or even entertaining (event on a  laughable level).  It should be said that Depp does smoke his cigarettes  in a particularly effective manner throughout his channeling session. By  the end of the documentary, one is left with the sense that the whole  project was an exercise in hagiography with few deep revelations, such as  one could find in the many,many biographies and writings of the principal  beat masters. The influence on the beats by women, gays,and people of  color(especially African American culture) is mentioned but glossed  over--the need for time for the performance pieces by the contemporary  Hollywood beat contingent meant that any deeper illumination about the beat  moment must be left to some other filmaker. However, if one is new to the  beat movement and has only read one or two of novels or other works, then  this video may work and give some extra dimension (at least in the first 45  mins.) to the beat moment and movement.",965001600,12,1804,4.9397993311036785
1348640,3,B00004STH1,"What's good about this documentary is all the great footage of the Beats. There is amazing interview footage of Corso and Burroughs later in life that I haven't seen anywhere else, along with choice clips of interviews of all the Beats that are in the other three or so good documentaries out there. (Really worth seeing are ""Kerouac: King of the Beats,"" ""What Ever Happened to Kerouac?"", and ""The Beat Generation"".) It's very worth watching just for this footage.

But unfortunately it tries to be too hip and too cute and ends up just being too glib and too distracting. It jumps frenetically between little swatches of otherwise great archival footage to stupid TV shows of the time, or to unrelated street scenes or bands playing. All of which gives it a distracting Attention Deficit Disorder/MTV music video feel. Very polished and Hollywood and very out of sorts with the Beats focus on authenticity. The film didn't need all this mess. The subjects of the documentary are so fascinating and energetic all by themselves, I don't know why the makers would try to spice it up by interrupting the enthralling footage with endless splices of goofy sounds and images.

Another annoying thing is that the makers work far too hard to draw the lineage between the Beats and the Hippies and the free speech movement. They end up talking about the 60s and to 60s personalities much too long. The connection between the Beats and Hippies is there, of course, but the makers way oversimplify and make it seem as if it's obvious to everyone that the Beats started the whole social revolution singlehandedly. And that's silly. It would have been much more potent if they'd spent less time on all that and instead had shown more of their great interview and performance footage of the main folks.

Again, very worth watching but I sure found the meddling of the film makers frustrating.",1140134400,7,1878,4.808049535603715
1348641,4,B00004STH1,"This movie is a fast ride and a lot of fun.  It is the furthest thing from a slow-moving documentary.  The technical style and flair would appeal to practically any viewer.  The Source is glossy and gorgeous.  The director's clout is also impressive. Johnny Depp gives a performance monologue as Jack Kerouac and John Torturro gives an emotional reading from ""Howl.""  Dennis Hopper imitates Burroughs as well later in the film.  Their efforts are impressive.

Just to let the skeptics out there know, there is no room for doubt in this documentary.  The beats are heroes and saviors--and not much else is considered.  That some of them were minor talents is brushed over.  Massive beat generation fans would give it five stars.  A totally sanitized version of William S. Burroughs is presented, and it is implied that Kerouac was only a heterosexual, which is something that most commentators would regard as dubious.  The film's attitude towards drug use is rather slanted.  One memorable quotation was, ""you can overdose on anything including sushi.""  Well no, not really.

It does not matter though, the movie is an amazing sprint and it succeeds in making itself impossible to turn off.",1115942400,18,1190,4.969543147208122
1348642,3,B00004STH1,"A documentary that wears its heart on its sleeve, ""The Source"" is a great collection of archival clips and contemporary interviews. It overreaches trying to connect all of the movement's reference points from Herbert Huncke to Henry Rollins -- the final half hour is a dizzying mix of quick cuts and fleeting words -- though it certainly does indicate the breadth of Beat syle, the film takes on a very slapdash quality. The admirable recreations of Ginsberg, Kerouac and Burroughs seem unncessary when there's so much available footage, especially in a film that runs only 90 minutes. Still, ten seconds of Neal's madcap jitterbugging is worth all the well-intentioned homage. (One final sticking point: an all-inclusive overview of Beat influence that doesn't include Patti Smith, Tom Verlaine or Richard Hell isn't really complete, is it?) Workman did extensive digging in the film archives, however, reminding us that the Beat movement was as visual as it was literary. The final scenes of Ginsberg reading his own words on Times Square marquees is especially moving.",1114387200,13,1071,5.196531791907514
1348643,3,B00004STH1,"The DVD is interesting, but there is too much of the same old commentary that has been circulating in beat documentaries for years.  Many of the folks interviewed weren't all that significant to the movement.  However, the Burroughs footage alone is worth the effort - but not nearly enough Jack Kerouac footage - there should have been much  more of Jack and much less modern critique by folks who just weren't there.  I would have liked to have seen more of Gregory Corso as well, but he has some priceless moments in the film!  The Neil Cassady footage is also very good.  Ginsberg is Ginsberg.  I didn't get the point of the Johnny Depp/Dennis Hopper/John Turturro bits.  Although Turturro's performance is by far the best!  Overall, it's a nice documentary but not as ground breaking as was hyped.",1067212800,10,802,4.753623188405797
1348644,4,B00004STH1,"""The Source,"" director Chuck Workman's documentary about the Beat Generation, is as close to communing with a bygone generation as possible. In this examination of the lives of modern American literature's unholy Trinity -- Allen Ginsberg (""HOWL""), Jack Kerouac (""On the Road"") and William S. Burroughs (""Naked Lunch"") -- and how they unwittingly made thoughts pulse to their own strange beat, Workman's film releases the essence of these legends by casting a spell of media voodoo. Ironically, this same method of divination is responsible for bringing bits of these great personalities into the minds of today's commercially fed youth -- remember the infamous Burroughs Nike ad and the use of Kerouac's image to sell blue jeans?
This look back at the fathers of the Beat Generation was filmed before Ginsberg was silenced by cancer in the spring of 1997, yet the poet functions as a spirit-guide not unlike Virgil in Dante's ""Inferno."" He gently takes us from the initial meeting of the three writers in 1944 at Columbia University to their inspiration by Neal Cassady through the '50s, the Jazz Age and into the '60s with the youthful interpretation of what they started and how it fomented a revolution.
Like Dante, we are left on our own for much of the documentary to sort through the barrage of incredible footage, interviews and huge cast of players, which Workman must have sold nearly a pound of his own soul to procure. The surreal nature of Burroughs loading his gun or watching Neal Cassady do a jig by a Volkswagen bus, plunges the audience even deeper into the past by humanizing men whose mythic importance is on the same level as JFK or James Dean.
It is these scenes that make ""The Source"" such a fine record of a lost age. Workman's labor of love is crafted like the best college history courses. We hear exactly what altered the state of the spoken and written word, and the writers' astonishment that they were being emulated and taken so seriously. Burroughs' contempt, Kerouac's confusion and Ginsberg's quiet acceptance of their fame are illuminating to those of us who weren't there or didn't pay close enough attention to the centers of culture.
Workman goes a bit astray with his use of reenactments, a decidedly MTV convention that, for the most part, serve only as a minor distraction. It's easy to buy Johnny Depp reciting bits and pieces of Jack Kerouac's works in what looks like a roadside bar, but Dennis Hopper's attempts at sections of Burroughs' ""Junky,"" ""Interzone"" and ""Queer"" are terrible. It might be because Hopper is, in fact, a legend unto himself, and it's difficult to see him as another from the same period. (An excellent Burroughs can be seen in David Cronenberg's ""Naked Lunch"" starring Peter Weller as an amalgamated William S.). All is forgiven, though, because the fresh memory of John Turturro's visceral rendition of Ginsberg's ""HOWL"" outside the Rockland State Hospital in New York City is unforgettable and truly inspired.
However, much of the footage is painful, and Workman is determined to present this mythological period by picking at the scabs of time and the recent commercial deification of these people. Scenes of an angry and pickled Kerouac trying to discuss the essence of writing with talk show host Steve Allen -- and then if you can believe it, William F. Buckley -- are quite sobering and make it clear that theirs' was more of a struggle than a party.
Then there are the shots of Burroughs that are about as comforting as the cold sweat that lets the addict know he hasn't killed himself. He's young and dangerous, wielding a knife in one scene and a syringe in the next. And although there is a perverse thrill watching the world-famous junky shoot up for the camera, we also get to see the needles in his eyes filled with scorn for anyone unlucky enough to be on the other side of that camera. One can almost feel him looking through the movie screen, searching for the kind of people who will eventually frequent ""art houses"" to watch films about things that should be read in books.
Just when it appears that everything is getting too weird, Ginsberg returns. Wrapped in a blanket and looking so much like his Dantaen counterpart, he glides through the early morning light of New York -- with lines of his poetry materializing on a nearby movie marquee.",1026259200,47,4331,4.830417227456258
1348645,4,B00004STH1,"Released in 1999 to coincide with the publication of ""The Rolling Stone Book of the Beats"", this Chuck Workman documentary is a kaleidoscope of film clips, photos and interviews with a particular focus on Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac and William Burroughs. I looked forward to seeing this video in anticipation of learning something. After all, these writers influenced the era in which I was growing up and opened unique and dramatic new ways of viewing the world. Tracing the early beginnings in the 1940s and bringing the movement right up to the present, it showed the changes in these young men (and they were ALL men) through the years.
With the exception of Allen Ginsberg, they look like they all turned...out of touch with reality and locked into a way of thinking whose off-kilter attitude which was once hip, turned into an off-kilter attitude which never grew out of the fifties and seems ""mental"" today. Gregory Corso and Lawrence Ferlinghetti look like bad smelling derelicts. On a talk show in later years Kerouac, with slurred speech insists that the Vietnam war was a plot of the Vietnamese to get American jeeps and, in a later interview with William F. Buckley Jr., his eyes are red-rimmed and droopy and his words seem like babble as he is demolished by the precise cutting words of his host. The film moves fast and the clips come one after another. Often, the cast of characters are not identified and it was hard for me to follow just who was who. There's Ken Kesey. And Neal Cassady. And short film clips from 50s TV shows from Father Knows Best and Alfred Hitchcock poking fun at the Beatniks. It was hard to follow any individual story line and I found myself getting bored.
Several well known actors were hired to read some of the writing itself. Johnny Depp did a good job of reading Kerouac and Dennis Hopper read from Burroughs. John Turturro, was emotional in his reading of insberg's ""Howl"" but he never rose above the material. I wish this film was better. I would really like to know more about the beats. For years I've carried around the idea that some day I'd pick up acopy of ""On the Road"" or ""Naked Lunch"" in a secondhand book store and explore these writers for myself. But frankly, after hearing bits andpieces of them in this film, I've lost most of my interest. These ravings from angry young men intent on ripping preconceived culture apart certainly did influence our world. I say ""hooray"" for the effort. I'm personally glad that they opened the way to the future. But, after seeing this film, I'm not sure I want to enter their world through their words.",1003190400,13,2601,4.681222707423581
1348646,5,B00004STH1,"This is a serious documentary on the beat / hippie movement. It has tons of old footage and interviews with many of the most prominent beat figures like Ginsberg, Kerouac, Burroughs, Corso, Ferlinghetti etc etc. It has historical footage of events like the Democratic National Convention in '68 and the be-in in San Francisco in '67. This is the perfect movie for someone who loves the beats or someone who has never heard of them. I didn't know much about them when i first watched this documentary on PBS, but after watching it i immediately became interested in their movement. I started reading a lot of the major works like On The Road, Naked Lunch, and Howl and turned into a major fan. This movie is exceptionally well-made and presented. It does have some Hollywood stars like Johnny Depp, but they are only reading the works of Beat authors, and do not have a major role. This is just a great documentary which contains valuable information and interviews with major beat characters who have since passed away. This is a must have for any fan of the beats, hippies, yippies, drugs, american literary movements, the counterculture, or just good documentaries in general. I absolutely love it and have watched it several times.",986947200,26,1234,4.8254716981132075
1348647,5,B00004STH1,"""The Source"" is an excellent documentry on 'The Beat Generation'. It was so good I saw it twice in the theaters. The documentry has a wealth of new material as long as familiar classic footage. My personal favorite writer Jack Kerouac came out of the beat generation and it was fantastic to see him and learn more about him. The documentry always explores other key figures like :Ginsberg, Burroghs, Cassidy among others. Three actors recite famous works by Kerouac, Ginsberg and Burroghs. Johnny Depp and Dennis Hopper do fair jobs at working with material by Kerouac and Burroghs but Chuck Workman slaughters Ginsberg's poem ""Howl"". The only fault about this documentry was the previous and that it had to end. Check ""The Source"" out.",978912000,2,736,4.943548387096774
1348648,5,B00004STH1,"This is a good solid documentary that sticks to its subject.  The clips of Ginsberg & Burroughs are especially effective.  The celeb performances in the second half are all of the work itself & not just empty theatrics. The Beats are still a source to return to for inspiration & insight.  The world they emerged from is not all that different from the one in which we find ourselves now.  Of course there's more, but this video gives you enough to get you started & gives you enough of the good stuff to go back to later",976752000,4,521,4.34020618556701
1348649,4,B00004STH1,"When Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Burroughs set out in their writing, they had no idea what it would create - a whole movement.  This film, including  interviews taken when Ginsberg and Burroughs were alive, assembles clips  from media, film, and personal account to show the beginnings of the beats  up to the passing-away of Ginsberg and Burroughs.  With a large assembly of  other beat writers and the poets they influenced (Carroll and Bukowski), it  is an extensive study to a misunderstood movement.  It is interesting to  see the Beat propaganda of the sixties, how negative and mocking the media  treated the sense of a ""cool"" movement; they painted a false  portrait.  This film is for lovers of Beat or people genuinely interested.  However, if you do not like documentaries, you won't like this one.  Also,  I was disappointed to see Depp, Hopper, and Turturro reciting long pieces  of work when the actual writers could have performed it.  Honestly, I  skipped these parts.  I wanted to see Ginsburg doing ""Howl.""  Another disappointment is the DVD version, which was slapped together on  the fly.  I envisioned additional clips and useful information (let's face  it, you can put TONS on a DVD), but only had 2 or 3 screens of names  credited for making the movie and the trailer (in this case, not exciting).  However, with all disappointments aside, this film is good for a few  viewings.  It conveys a better picture of the Beats than other films have  before and enjoyed alot of the material.",965347200,5,1503,4.857142857142857

It deals with the one essential question, the ""It"" that Jack Kerouac wrote of. That is the secret and unspeakable heart of the Beat generation. If you read the novels, you will know what I mean. The ""It"" of his novels is ""the source"". This brought a group of unlikely and (in a lot of ways) different people together to form an art movement. Maybe the most important art movement in a couple hundred years. If the Beat generation mythology (and that is what it is) remains new to you, THE SOURCE is an excellent place to start.

7922028,4,B00004STH1,"Over the past several months I have, seemingly, grabbed every film documentary about the ""beat"" literary movement of the 1950s that I could get my hands on. This film, ""The Source"", continues that quest. And why am I interested in this movement, essentially a literary movement and not particularly, at least overtly, a consciously political movement that would not seem to fit in with other literary movements that I have given space to here? Well the short answer is that I just like the free verse spontaneous literary styles of Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs and company. More to the point I have been trying, as this documentary and others reviewed in this space have attempted as well, to link the liberating effects of that 1950s scene as forbears of my own generation, the Generation of '68, a much less literary-inclined generation.

That idea sets one of the parameters of my interest. Another is the question of what of this collective wealth of archival footage, interviews and readings that virtually all the films reviewed have presented gives the best idea of what was going on then for those of us who were really too young (or were not born yet)to appreciate this breathe of fresh air. This effort is one the better ones for two reasons. First, the producers have established clearly who they believe are (as I do) the central players in this drama, the above-mentioned Kerouac, Ginsberg and Burroughs. Of course, the ""beat' scene is not complete without recognizing the role that madman-for-all seasons Neal Cassady, Zen-master poet Gary Snyder, street poet Gregory Corso, Michael McClure, Lawrence Ferlinghetti (if for no other reason that the establishment of the City Lights Bookstore, a central hangout) , and host of other minor poets, hangers-on and crazies played. They are given space here, as well. But without the core literary/philosophical leadership of the three there make not have been such a phenomenon.

Secondly, and more importantly, in recognition of that centrality the producers have given over a fair amount of time for a rather short documentary (about an hour and a half) to extensive readings of Kerouac's work (by Johnny Depp) , Allen Ginsberg's ground-breaking and defining ""Howl"", and Burroughs ""Naked Lunch"" (by Dennis Hopper, who else, right?). These readings are important. ""Beat"" was driven by the sounds of jazz and the blues, among other aural influences so the sounds (and nuances) of the works are more critical than more cerebral efforts. Although to our current ears much of this may sound self-indulgent this was the breakout sound of the ""beats"", and to paraphrase Kerouac's ending to ""On The Road"", the sound of the fathers, the fathers that we never knew, Kerouac/Ginsberg/Burroughs.",1267660800,2,2764,5.099337748344371
