8498738,4,B006IQKWBC,"As an Aussie I was amused at the casting of Marlene and one of the other dubious characters as expatriate Australians. Dietrich and Gabin are both iconic actors but they ever establish the magic of say Tracy and Hephburn
 or Flynn and De Havillland .Nonetheless the movie is entertaining and a must for Dietrich's fans. I now only need Monte Carlo Story to complete my collection.",1383091200,,380,4.757575757575758
8498739,4,B006IQKWBC,"At first glance, Martin Roumagnac (1946) is most notable in that it stars Marlene Dietrich in her only French-speaking role as Blanche Ferrand.  However, this is not its only redeeming virtue.

In 1945, Ms. Dietrich wrapped up her European tour entertaining American GI's, and it was announced that she would stay on in Paris to film Martin Roumagnac, a romantic melodrama concerning sin, redemption and murder.  Further excitement was generated by the casting of Jean Gabin in the title role.  At the time, Mr. Gabin was France's biggest film star.  Unfortunately, there were problems from the start.

In order to be successful, the film would need an American distributor.  Lopess Films opted to release the film in the United States, but the then-powerful Legion of Decency was scandalized by the theme of open prostitution and demanded major cuts before it could be released.  The film was shortened from 115 minutes to 88 minutes for U.S. distribution and Martin Roumagac was not well received here or in Europe.  It was also re-titled The Room Upstairs for American audiences.

The story concerns Martin Roumagnac, a construction engineer, who meets lovely widow Blanche Ferrand at a local boxing match.  Mme. Ferrand and her uncle run a shop selling birds and bird feed, which is actually a front for Blanche's activities as a high-class prostitute.  While Blanche is waiting patiently for a local Consul to come into his wife's fortune, she begins an affair with the well-off engineer.  He is so smitten by her that he builds and presents her with her dream house, oblivious to warnings from friends and business associates that Mme. Ferrand is slowly draining his finances while waiting for the Consul to become available.  Things heat up when he finally sees the light and confronts her in a violent rage.  As the film finally evolves into a courtroom suspense drama, I would be remiss to disclose further plot details.

As a dramatic piece, Martin Roumagnac is not entirely unrewarding.  Although not successful at the time of its initial release and savaged by the critics, fans of both Marlene Dietrich and Jean Gabin are likely to experience great satisfaction, as the role of Mme. Ferrand is a meaty one for Miss Dietrich, and Jean Gabin demonstrates quite well why he was the number one French box-office draw at the time.  The acting is generally very good; the film contains successful humor as well as truly dramatic moments, and after viewing it I was not sorry that I spent the rather high price for this import.  The film is restored here to its original length of 115 minutes, and although it has not been re-mastered, the print is very good and the white subtitles (in English or Portuguese) stand out nicely against the black and white cinematography.  The DVD is coded for Region 0 and thus is playable anywhere.
