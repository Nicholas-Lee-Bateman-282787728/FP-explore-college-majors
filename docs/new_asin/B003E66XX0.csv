8395341,3,B003E66XX0,Its OK. Starts off well about island/beach assualts but then gets focused on the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Could have metioned other island conquest as well.,1431388800,,161,5.0
8395342,5,B003E66XX0,"Although the reviews that say the images are always the same, let's face it.  There is just so much archival footage available and this puts it to good usage.
