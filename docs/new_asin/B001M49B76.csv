8320386,5,B001M49B76,"Robert Ruark got me to Africa.  I read my first book of his in my mid-twenties and spent almost the next half-century dreaming of seeing the place.  When I first began dreaming of Africa and going on safari, I was an active hunter and was thinking of going over with lots of ammunition and coming home with lots of trophies.  But Africa has changed, and so have I.  I just pretty much don't shoot things anymore except with a camera.  And we went to South Africa instead of Kenya, as I feel the latter is just not as safe as I like to be.

So, we got there about 18 months ago, and it was fantastic.  We slept inside with hot and cold running water all of the evenings we were there, but the two different lodges where we stayed managed to convey the feeling of a classic tented African safari.  So, when I learned of the existence of this film, I really wanted to see Ruark in that setting and managed to locate and purchase it on Amazon.  Parts of it are a bit wonky, but overall it is a neat and accurate look at an African safari in what many consider to be the golden age there.  Of course, Ruark visited Kenya, and we didn't, but while we were in South Africa, the Nairobi air terminal burned to the ground.

So we really didn't miss Kenya.",1421020800,,1246,4.19327731092437
8320387,5,B001M49B76,"I recommend this DVD to anyone who has been on an African safari, anyone who plans to go on one or anyone who would just like to read about the good old days of a classic safari.  These days are gone but not forgotten.  Even though it is in B&W, it is so real that the time just flies by and it's over before you know it.  Considering the technology available, it is a remarkable story well told.",1382832000,,396,4.051282051282051
8320388,5,B001M49B76,I think this is fantastic.  My beau wanted this movie really bad but wasn't able to find it.  When I did I immediately placed the order.  He's gonna be tickled come Christmas,1350172800,,174,4.375
8320389,1,B001M49B76,"This release by Safari Press is an extremely poor print of a film that I know with certainty exists in far better condition because I have seen it twice on Turner Classic Movies. I bought this DVD because I wanted a copy of the film, but this is nothing like the image and sound quality of the original. Its not accurate to say that its an old film and has some roughness. We all understand that. The good quality copy I have seen has artifacts of its age, in the form of scratches, streaks, sound ticks, mono sound, etc. But this... its beyond rough, and has even got the titles, introduction and credits trimmed, causing me to speculate about whoever owns the rights to RKO Radio Pictures these days (Turner maybe?). Contrary to the impression created by the disclaimer, this film was a feature release in American theaters in 1954, not some home movie of African safari. Its a shame that these guys are marketing this because it will prevent the real complete, good quality print from being made for DVD. My advice -don't buy it. Instead, clamor to Turner Classic Movies to release their copy on DVD (you can vote on their site for old movies to be made into DVDs).",1250294400,13,1168,4.514150943396227
8320390,3,B001M49B76,"About what I expected, old black & white (some times home movie) quality. I have read several books by Ruark and having an interest in this subject, wanted to see a movie from this era. You need to listen carefully to the dialogue and it would help to have read a Ruark book or two - especially ""Something of Value"" as this safari - movie was made during the Mau Mau uprising. Has some neat scenes in it.",1233014400,7,404,4.1923076923076925
