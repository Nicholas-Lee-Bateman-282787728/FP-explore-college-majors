8397095,4,B0009IWFFQ,The DVD was well filmed and edited.  It showed the steps and you could really see how each movement was completed.  The subject matter was spot on.  I actually met the gentleman doing the demonstration.  The DVD will show you all that you can practically learn from watching kata.,1370390400,,280,4.653061224489796
8397096,5,B0009IWFFQ,"If you want to see how sanchin is performed to the Nth degree get this DVD.  But this DVD does not teach sanchin kata, it only shows how it is done by a great Uechi-ryu master.  The filming is first rate  and as clean as a whistle.  Though the kata is not taught on this DVD, anyone studying the form, especially Uechi-ryu students, would benefit greatly by studyng this DVD.  The first part is an historical account of Okinawa and of the man who brought Pangai Noon (Uechi-ryu)  to Okinawa, Kanbun Uechi.  Following this, Sanchin is performed from several angles, along with the testing of form by hitting and kicking the performers.  Then there is the breaking of boards: 2 by 2's, stacks of 1 by 12's, and 2 by 4's.  This is a great DVD for anyone who is interested in seeing what the real thing is.",1178928000,2,802,4.364864864864865
