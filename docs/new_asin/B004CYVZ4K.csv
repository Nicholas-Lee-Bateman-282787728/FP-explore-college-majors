4330505,4,B004CYVZ4K,"I knew both leads from the ""Going for Gold"" movie weren't going to reprise their roles in this sequel. That said:
Loved Francia. She's got a natural rhythm for this movie and looks the part! Was surprised at the choice of Brendan in this role but he was sneaky good! The only scene that was inadequate IMHO was the last where he said that he loved her! That was given as if reading from a script! Otherwise, good action, different point of view and the leads seemed to work very well with each other! Certainly enjoyed it!",1306540800,5,522,4.391752577319588

4330507,5,B004CYVZ4K,"For starters, this movie really heats it up compared to the others, so probably not a totally ""family"" movie. This movie is definitely better than the last two installments of The Cutting Edge run. I am an avid fan of the first movie, and this one parallels the first a lot more than the last two.

This is a simple, light-hearted, enjoyable skating movie, and is not meant to be deeply complex. I highly recommend to anyone just looking for a great movie! One diasppointing fact is that we have to see Miss Delgado's body over and over while she dones a sportsbra, the extra lbs. she put on from the last movie don't do the movie any justice, and fail to show what a real healthy, fit, and atheltic pairs competitor would look like. On a lighter note, it is definitely a plus that we are finally blessed with a decent-looking male lead. Sorry if that seems shallow, but the last two were way to immature for this role (in acting, physicality, and flair on the ice). Ow Ow!",1299456000,17,973,4.405555555555556

With the Chinese coach speaking in his native language, there is not a translation for all his advice to the skaters.

4330563,5,B004CYVZ4K,Great movie.  Although I was really bummed that she was the same girl from the last movie and 2 characters from previous cutting edge movies broke up with their men.  Movies with happy endings should not be spoiled in sequels. Other than that I love Brendan Fehr and he did not disappoint in this movie.

4330600,1,B004CYVZ4K,"This sequel to Cutting Edge: Chasing the Dream never thawed.  There was absolutely no chemistry between the two main characters, unlike its predecessor which had Matt Lanter in the lead male role. Brendan Fehr could have skated on his head and still wouldn't have been able to build a bridge over troubled ice. The actual ice skating scenes were nice to watch regardless of who was doing the skating.  But, in the end, this was basically a remake of the previous Cutting Edge minus any real story.  Fehr was so deadpan that one didn't really care if he even made it to the final event on time. The producers of this series should have stopped while they were ahead.  To paraphrase a more famous quote: ""I think they went an ice skating rink too far.""  Even the background music to the ice skating had a ""second fiddle"" quality; and the whole was emotionally barren.  There may have been plenty of ice but, to once again paraphrase a more famous quote, ""Where's the fire?!""",1424304000,,972,4.589595375722543

4330620,5,B004CYVZ4K,i think that this is a really lovbe story and a great movie to watch how they make out they don't like each other,1400544000,,113,3.75
4330621,3,B004CYVZ4K,"I love skating movie and have seen all 4 movies. Would anyone had guess this title would get 3 sequel!?!?! I didn't. I honestly didn't know there was, but I just finished watching all 3 sequels today. Out of the 3 movie sequels, I felt this one is the best sequel!

Let me first start off by saying, I don't mind watching the same movie plot thrown at me. At least these movies were under the same name. Other movies will try to copy or steal other movies plot's, but these movies have the right to do so. That's why I watched all 3 sequels. I knew that they were going to just do the same thing as the original, but with different lead actors. I don't mind that. I watched this movie for the chemistry and see if the actors are believe able and the skating.

Now, the acting was pretty good. I believed the main actors, but the supporting cast just sucked. The skating wasn't all too great this time around. I felt they rushed though the whole movie and just barely touched the skating element of it and kept the main focus on the love story. These two only skated on air twice during the whole movie?!

The movie really tries to do something new with the skating by introducing a new move into the mix. No more Pamchenko folks. This the the Macanator! A.K.A The Amazing Delgado! So, what is that? It basically was build up to be this amazing difficult move that will raise the bar for their skating. I don't what happened for skating but it seemed the level of difficult has dropped a lot since the first movie. When I actually saw the movie, it left me stun. Not because it was so amazing. It was so lame and dull. Basically, the male lead tosses the female lead high into the air and she spans and lands. WTF??? I seen skaters do that all the time. In fact, in the first movie, Doug and Kate first move during of Olympic games was this exact move! What's so hard about it? Was it just because Alex was upside down first and then flip back upright then going into the move? Because that wasn't that hard for them to do. This left me shocked and disappointed as the movie ended right after. There was no reaction from the crowd, coaches, commentators, or anyone. Not even the skaters said anything about it. That was total waste of a climax moment.

I really felt the love story took too much out of the movie and that's why the movie didn't have enough staking. The skaters had somewhat a romantic connections, but I felt the last two squeals had of a connections than these two. Most of the time, I felt these two were just too confused about each other than love each other. Also, this was the first sequel to show the skaters go all the way with each other. The last two sequels barely had the couples kiss and that's it. This movie shows the leads go the distances and then some.

I'm not going to be hard on this movie and give it a 1 or 2 stars because I felt the movie did keep up with the traditional plot. It tried to do something new at the end, even though it didn't work out for me. It showed the leads can do more than kiss in the movie. Yes, I would give this a 3 stars. I recommend this movie, if you like all the rest of the Cutting Edge movies, you should watch this too then.",1400284800,,3196,4.207177814029364
4330622,3,B004CYVZ4K,"Francia Raisa reprises her role as Alexandra ""Alex"" Delgado in film franchise. The Cutting Edge: Fire & Ice is a TV movie that follows the The Cutting Edge 3: Chasing the Dream. It also stars Brendan Fehr. It was produced for the ABC Family cable channel.

Alex whose figure skating career came to an abrupt halt after her partner became injured. As their love affair cooled, a heart-broken Alex stopped competing and turned to teaching. Enter James McKinsey, the smoldering bad boy of speed skating, who has had fiery Alex in his sights as a skating partner ever since he was banned from speed skating. There aren't many girls who say no to James and Alex may well be the first. However, James pushes her buttons, challenging her like no one else and her fighting spirit returns. She agrees to be his partner and they begin a grueling practice regimen fueled by their own tempestuous relationship which heats up as they get closer to competition. But will their passion destroy Alex's chance to bring home the gold again? Your guess is as good as mine.

I think that is about time to end doing poor sequels of The Cutting Edge. The three films that were produced - the Cutting Edge 2,Cutting Edge 3 and this film - have somewhat hurt the legacy of classic first film. I think that repeating the same thematic plots of the Tony Gilroy's script has become tiresome and uninteresting for viewers. They offer practically nothing different. But at least,Brendan Fehr and Francia Raisa have great chemistry and have tried their best with their characters. The only good thing about it is the entertainment it provides and the figure skating scenes. Nothing more. But nevertheless,it is time to end doing further sequels that does not even hold a candle to the D.B. Sweeney-Moira Kelly starrer.",1399939200,7,1788,4.783171521035599

Its the worst ice skating movie ive ever seen...and I love ice skating. Lucky I bought this movie for a fraction of the total price. Not worth owning. Much preffered the previous three movies. The main actor was a speed skater, nothing like figure skating..Yet he picked up figure skating soo fast, the main actress was a gold winning figure skater, her character was more like a regular person who loved to ice skate with no skills, her characters skills didn't show to be much more than the speed skaters. Where were her figure skating skills, where was the difference between the two ice sports? He just smirked his way through the movie. Some of the worst acting ever!

However, if you like the other three movies in the franchise, you should add this one to your collection for prosperity.",1356307200,,322,4.981481481481482
4330645,5,B004CYVZ4K,I just love the whole series. Each movie stands great on their own so if you miss one you still kind of have an idea of what happened in the others and aren't totally lost. It's just a wonderful movie.,1354924800,,201,4.05
4330646,1,B004CYVZ4K,I was disappointed. The info of the movie left a lot of questions open. What happened to her partner and they spit up. The role of the male was lacking and her performance was questionable at times. To me they did not match up right for this role. Lacked alot of info from her first film watch was very good and I enjoyed Matt and her performance in that movie. Would of liked to see them again together. The guy was to hard and into himself all the time. Very disappointed in the movie.,1350777600,,487,4.191489361702128
4330647,1,B004CYVZ4K,"Buy The Cutting Edge and The Cutting Edge, Chasing the Dream.  Don't bother with this one. It is, at best, a very poor rewrite of the previous stories. That doesn't begin to convey the disappointment you will feel while watching this movie.",1345507200,,240,4.714285714285714
4330648,5,B004CYVZ4K,I received this DVD it was as described in very good condition and played as great as a new one.  I enjoyed this movie very much as it is the fouth of a series it holds up good in the story line.,1337644800,,195,3.642857142857143

It arrived very timely.",1334534400,,148,4.25
4330650,5,B004CYVZ4K,"Received the item in brand new condition as described, and it played perfectly on my blue-ray player.

I bought this for my wife as a Christmas present to complete her trilogy collection of this movie series. She loved it and has watched it many times.

P.S.: It not a bad movie, even for ""manly"" men to watch with their significant others.",1334361600,,340,4.557377049180328
4330651,4,B004CYVZ4K,"Based on the reviews I wasn't expecting much, but this movie was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. I'm a huge fan of the first movie and I think Fire & Ice was the best sequel so far (I watched all of them).

Very entertaining and the story was well told. The only thing that disappointed a little was the last skating scene. It's the climax of the movie and you expect lots of vibration as they perform their best routine, but there was silence and the movie suddenly finished. My first reaction was: what?

Nevertheless, it's a very good movie and if you liked the first one, there is a good chance you'll enjoy this one too.",1334102400,,641,4.203252032520325

4330653,4,B004CYVZ4K,Enjoyed the film. Fun afternoon movie with expected romance formula. Enjoyed the banter between the couple. Just wish the ending was too sudden..not great closure. All in all I enjoy and have watched it several times.,1322352000,,217,5.055555555555555
4330654,4,B004CYVZ4K,I enjoyed this movie it was more like the first Cutting Edge. Have been waiting for this to be on DVD since number 3 came out.,1315872000,,126,3.8846153846153846
4330655,2,B004CYVZ4K,Very disappointed. SOooo much bickering and fighting and not enough skating. It's worst than a reality shows. Why there cannot be movie about a sport (Especially figure skating) that my daughter can watch and people are actually nice to each other.,1315440000,,248,5.073170731707317
4330656,1,B004CYVZ4K,"Frankly, this movie was a total waste of money - there was little ""fire and ice"" to make it even remotely interesting. ""The Cutting Edge: Chasing the Dream"" ended on such a positive note that it was disappointing to have a sequal that took away from the ending of the other. The characters were not as interesting as in the previous movie, and I found myself wondering what happened to the rest of Alexandra's family as only the mother seemed to be around. The poutiness of Alexandra's character got a little old the second time around. She seems to always have a chip on her shoulder and appears to be so angry with life. One wonders if she will ever grow up. There was way too much arrogance and anger to make this an enjoyable movie and the skating was disappointing in comparison to the other movies. The dialogue in this movie was so lacking that even the last line, ""Just remember who said it first,"" was taken from the original ""Cutting Edge"" movie.

All in all, the dialogue, the plot, the development of the characters was ""amateur skating"" at its worst. Additionally, it is unrealistic to think that these two characters were going to put any quality skating together in a short period of time by a coach who could not even speak English and had little spunk in comparison to the coaches in the original movie and the ""Chasing the Dream"" sequel.

""The Cutting Edge: Fire and Ice"" is shallow and boring and to quote from the original movie, it simply ""didn't get the job done.""",1313366400,15,1486,4.541044776119403
