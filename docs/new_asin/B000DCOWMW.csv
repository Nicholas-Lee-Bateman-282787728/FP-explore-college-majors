""17-Year Cicada"" DVD video by [...]; produced by Dennis Leinbaugh.

To a non-specialist, this non-narrated footage may seem like it lasts 17 years. However, the close-up nature photography is high quality. The very rare occasional captions fail to keep the average person's attention, and there is much going on physiologically that is never described. The video consists of a 54-minute mostly real-time observation of the cicada emergence and a 4-minute summary that has far better captioned explanations, and includes footage not in the first 54 minutes. Having experienced several brood emergences, I find that the sound track for the 54-minute segment is strange and does not resemble the drawn-out ""Pharaoh, pharaoh...."" of the adults that I recall, but sounds more like static or the fall dog-day cicada in most scenes.  The 17-year cycle includes 16-years underground which is never seen. This footage slowly slowly slowly follows the emerging last instars from emergence holes up the trees, and witnesses the shedding of that last exoskeleton. The lining of the tracheae are seen being shed, but this is never noted. Both normal and abnormal insects are shown, with various deformities in wings, etc. Predation by ants and squirrels is briefly pictured. Adults, mating, and egg depositing are also well-illustrated.  The 4-minute summary is more usable by a high school or college biology teacher; segments of the longer program are useful to an entomology teacher.  In both cases, the teacher will have to narrate.  The best views of the damage to trees are in the 4-minute summary.",1299024000,2,1610,5.26953125
