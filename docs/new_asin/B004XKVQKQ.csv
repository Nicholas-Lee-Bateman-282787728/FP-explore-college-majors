4496066,5,B004XKVQKQ,"ZEN debuted last night on PBS and if the opening episode is any indication of things to come, then we have a delightful summer delicacy on hand.  The series takes place in Rome and features a detective known for his integrity, a Venetian by the name of Zen (Aurelio Zen) played with understated classy style by Rufus Sewell.  Zen, who lives with his mother (Catherine Spaak) after his crumbled marriage is involved in defining the responsibility for some murders in the past which happen to mimic some recent murders - and in the complex process we discover that the Italian government wants to engage him on one side of the investigation while another somewhat shady source engages his for the opposite legal decision.  There is plenty action and suspense and the uncovering of secrets about the house where the most recent murders took place - a mansion undermined with tunnels and caves and rapidly flowing rivers where a strange young girl Silvia (Cariddi Nardulli) hides from a society that has abused her.  Zen perseveres in his intelligent search for facts, a search that happens to include some beautiful photography of the Italian countryside, a romantic interest in the form of the beautiful Tania (Caterina Morino) who is being pursued by the entire office of Zen's workplace, especially by one Vincenzo Fabri (Ed Stoppard),  a team of bad buys out for vengeance against the police, and a host of other characters who suggest avenues this series may take.

The cast is sterling though for the most part unexplainably British in this Italian set drama  (Stanley Townsend, Ben Miles, Francesco Quinn, Anthony Higgins, Garry Cooper, Adrian Schiller and Cosima Shaw)  but the key to the success of this series is the solid work by Rufus Sewell.  While the winter and spring shows rest, this series deserves summer attention.  Grady Harp, July 11",1310947200,40,1852,4.945161290322581
4496087,5,B004XKVQKQ,Series wraps up nicely after 3 substantial episodes. Very well done and could have easily gone on for many more. Story lines were suspenseful and acting was wonderful.,1502236800,,167,5.0
4496088,5,B004XKVQKQ,After a recent trip to Rome I bought the DVDs so I could watch the Zen series for the second time and see Rome again through the great background shots In Zen.  I loved seeing it again.,1501113600,,185,4.0
4496089,3,B004XKVQKQ,"Maybe it's because I've read all books - twice.  The series just didn't live up to the printed word and my imagination.  Probably the very British accents didn't help either.

4496090,5,B004XKVQKQ,"If I could give this short 3-part series 6 stars, I would.  I saw Vendetta and Cabal aired on my local PBS channel and, once I got by the ""Italian"" characters speaking with various English accents, was immediately hooked.  Aurelio Zen (the main character) comes across as a kind of modern-day Peter Falk (for those of you old enough to remember the ""Columbo"" series from years ago) - but with a twist.  He knows that the Italian police department is rife with people occupying their jobs via a loose system of nepotism and he (Zen) serves as a kind of ""straight arrow"" - more concerned with solving the crime than with appeasing his fellow workers and superiors.  The truly unexpected high point (for me at least) was the inclusion of an absolutely gorgeous female character portrayed by Caterina Murino throughout the series.  Anyone looking for a short series of police  shows with some thought put into their background will certainly enjoy this series.",1497052800,2,956,4.8343558282208585

4496096,5,B004XKVQKQ,"Zen is a great mini-series. My wife and I enjoyed it when it aired on our local PBS station and this Blu-ray edition on our 4K HDTV adds wonderful details and the bonus features are great fun and informative.

Rufus Sewell and Caterina Murino are great as is the rest of the cast. My wife and I have been fortunate enough to have spent time in Europe and in Italy. These films certainly reminded us of why visiting there again would be worthwhile.

It is a shame that the series was not continued but just having these three film episodes is very rewarding. We enjoy and own many of the PBS mysteries and Zen is one of the very best.",1489708800,3,633,4.266666666666667

The ensemble cast works so well together.  Great chemistry between Rufus Sewell and the woman (sorry I can't recall her name) .
Just such a pleasure to see something of this quality on TV.  The musical score is awesome too.  Had to order the DVDs as Hulu Plus dropped them from the lineup.  Shame on them!",1464220800,6,466,4.111111111111111

4496137,5,B004XKVQKQ,"Ultimate crime-political conspiracy-drama tour-de-fo/arce.  Left Bank Pictures (also did Wallander for BBC) Italian detective reminiscent of French spy-spoof classic ""Le grand blond avec une chaussure noire"".  Episodes don't follow Dibdin's original novels closely, but they're terrific nonetheless and contain the right British and Italian elements.  Escapism made with gentle irony and energetic style.  If BBC could just have made a few more episodes...Why not Berlusconi and the Italian Tourist Board?  Rufus Sewell's Aurelio Zen is half Mr. Magoo/half Sherlock; Katerina Murino/Tania Moretti is thoroughly stunning.  Sewell's portrayal of the hero must have failed the PC checklist of the BBC bosses (like Moscati in the films).  The humorous element is most faithful to the novels, but even the bit parts are memorable.  Beautiful and highly appealing. Kudos to PBS for showing it.",1439683200,2,887,5.717557251908397

4496139,5,B004XKVQKQ,Huge Rufus Sewell fan.  Films are easier to digest than the book.  Great landscape shots to boot.  Well worth the purchase.  Shame the TV series did not run longer.  Great detective work.,1439337600,,187,4.71875
4496140,5,B004XKVQKQ,"The day I received ZEN  I played all three mysteries, then turned right around and played them all again, they were that good. The producers, director, and stars have taken the spirit of writer Michael Dibdin's Inspector Zen and delivered a great series, convoluted, griping,fascinating, true to the original stories--and even better played out against the grandeur and political corruption of Rome. Rufus Sewell's Inspector Zen might be 'too incorruptible for his own good,' as one character tells him, but he is brilliant and dedicated policeman  and he understands only too well the intricate and corrupt political ramification that he has to survive to bring his cases to a solution that satisfies both his sense of honor and the political system.  It is a pleasure to watch him out-maneuver his opponents, the rich, criminals, politicians, even other policemen, as they underestimate him.  I could happily watch them all again--I think I will.",1438214400,5,948,5.217105263157895

4496156,4,B004XKVQKQ,"I'm late to the dance on Zen, and sorry there are only 3 episodes available. That said, they are thoroughly enjoyable once you get past the ridiculous conceit of about twenty Brits running around pretending to be Italian. Sewell carries the day with a dry wit. After one situation where he escapes a dinner with his mother and ex-wife by going out for tomatoes and getting kidnapped, he simply explains hours later that he was ""kidnapped at gun-point"" and no one believes him.

My only grievances are with some of the writing, which may or may not be true to the books, I don't know, but the plot of Vendetta, where an ex-con wanders about executing judges is entirely ripped off from Francesco Rosi's Illustrious Corpses (1974?), admittedly a rare film starring Lino Ventura. The plot resolution in Vendetta is also completely lame.

But despite these flaws (and the action scenes are just horrible, I guess because they had no money in the production budget) the show is just so damn entertaining you are quick to forgive. My favorite is the number of lovely women who keep offering themselves to Zen but he instead goes home to his mother.

There was one clever description of Rufus Sewell reminding the viewer of a young Mastroianni, but he actually struck me looking more like a young Armand Assante (his jaw and cheekbones, check it out) only admittedly less masculine than Assante.

Anyway, these are certainly fun and worth your time. Is the writing up to Sandbaggers standards? No. But in these thin times we will take what we can get.",1428451200,,1544,4.75

4496158,5,B004XKVQKQ,"This British production of Michael Dibdin's Zen series are entertaining and very well done. Filmed on location in Rome, the films are lovely; acting, directing, everything is great. However, as a fan of the books,  I find the leading actor just a bit too young to fit my image of Zen, and the focus on sex seems a bit overdone in the three stories here included. The story plot lines follow the three novels more or less, but they take everything to Rome, and the various novels carry Zen about Italy in many locales. I recommend the DVD set very much, but say to Zen book fans: Forget the original stories and characters; just view this series as something completely new.",1427673600,,673,4.56198347107438

4496161,5,B004XKVQKQ,"I can't write enthusiastically enough about ZEN. Rufus Sewell is just brilliant in this series of three one and half hour shows. This actor plays a laconic detective who is honest to a fault but is so intelligent in his assessment of the right way to handle a case he always manages to handle a case on the side of justice despite the vested interest of superiors pressuring him to handle it to suit their own unjust agenda. Sewell with the raising of an eyebrow can convey more as an actor than most actors can convey with a face full of expression. The show has political intrigue, office politics, romance (a wonderful romantic subplot so nuanced yet passionate as hell between Zen and the beautiful Caterina Murino--just wonderful--very European), the man in the middle drama and great doses of Italian scandals. Add to that, it is shot in Rome, and you have a refreshingly mature crime drama against a gorgeous, well-shot backdrop, with ample comic levity, cutting wit delivered as dry as the perfect martini but wonderfully funny. I cannot recommend this show highly enough. If a hundred stars were available, I'd give it a hundred stars.",1423440000,,1144,4.812182741116751

But the plots, characters and acting are excellent, too. Aurelio Zen played by Rufus Sewall is a likable detective in the corrupt Italian police force. He, however, has scruples and integrity. How he works with the corrupt system, and keep his job, is one of the delights of the series. The actors are primarily British, but look Italian enough. There's a beautiful love interest for Zen, but the plot and Zen are the focus of the series. Sewell is fun to watch. There's nothing too gory.

4496199,4,B004XKVQKQ,"Being a fan of Michael Dibdin's Aurelio Zen I purchased this set  a couple years ago anticipating a lengthy ongoing series. That never came to pass and the films now have to be looked at as a stand-alone trilogy culled from three of his best selling novels. The films were reportedly an expensive project to put together and probably disappointed many Dibdin fans looking for the multiple story threads and nuanced characters he was known for.  Rome is notoriously difficult to film on location as the government refuses to close off streets for film crews and all it takes is one yahoo mugging for the camera to ruin 5 hours of prep work which undoubtedly contributed to the cost over runs.  Additionally, timing wasn't ideal to embark on such an ambitious project as the UK was mired in recession and North America's PBS* was looking more toward properties that they could influence to better target audience demographics.  While perfectly suited for a rainy afternoon viewing, potential customers should be aware that Dibdin wrote layered novels with numerous subplots and dozens of characters that don't easily convert into 90 minute screenplays.  And while these episodes bear some resemblance to the novels, at best they can be considered ""Zen-lite"".

Having said all that, these are still 3 very enjoyable films that bear positive comparison to several Cary Grant theatrical releases of the 1950's and 60's.  Rufus Sewell and Caterina Murino are about as sexy and stylish a couple as one could ask for, and both come with a fair amount of onscreen baggage that makes their lives as murky as the plots.  The films fall somewhere between police drama and romantic comedy, managing to retain the best of both genre. The cinematography is stellar and if you've never been to Rome you'll probably have to physically restrain yourself from booking a flight by the time ""Ratking's"" closing credits roll.  While not what I had hoped for given the quality of the source material, the set is still eminently enjoyable as escapist fare with a top notch cast, stylish settings, and stunning visuals of one of the most compelling cities in the world..... AND, there's enough of each novel's plot left to pull it all together as a coherent cinematic trilogy.

*  ""Masterpiece Mystery"" was created as a production entity to provide material that would bring PBS a wider audience than it had previously enjoyed.  While they still purchase extant programming under syndication agreements, they also co-produce projects that allow them to better target certain demographics traditionally missing from their audience.  The predecessor, ""PBS Mystery!"" on the other hand was developed by member station WGBH as a hosted venue to showcase existing UK television properties. Other than occasional ham fisted editing and over zealous censoring PBS Mystery! programming was identical to that broadcast in the UK home market.",1399852800,12,2906,5.092631578947368

4496220,5,B004XKVQKQ,"Zen is a fabulous detective series! Rufus Sewell shines in these three feature length programs. His rye and subtle sense of humor works perfectly with the stories and he does a great job conveying his thoughts and feelings with just a look.

The whole series, in fact, is well cast. I know some will hate to hear British accents instead of Italian or Italian accents, I love the series Don Matteo, but, I sometimes get tired of reading the subtitles! So, it is a relief that the Zen shows are in English so I can relax and enjoy the programs.

The scenes of Italy are a large part of the program too, which I thoroughly enjoy. The stories are all good and there is some real exciting, edge-of-your seat moments when Zen finds himself crawling through an all too small underground shaft. These scenes were well filmed and I'd swear I was out of breath after that bit was over.

There is so much more that Zen has to offer than three episodes/movies and I sincerely hope that some company will rescue this series so that more can be made.",1388534400,2,1036,4.442105263157894

That is not to take anything away from the wonderful acting and the visual treat of Rome and other venues in this series. Rufus Sewell is magnificent and adds a sweetness to his mother, a well deserved verbal smack to his horrid wife, and the affaire with his secretaria is enjoyable without a lot of senseless sexy scenes. Ben Miles plays a too small but really great role in this series which adds some comedy and intrigrue, enjoyed the entire 3 stories and can only think that BBC won't produce more because it must have cost a fortune to film all the wonderful sites. It is a shame more of the ""Zens"" won't be filmed as this is pure delight.

The story lines keep me enthused as well as the most beautiful of Italian scenery. Zen is not afraid to get his ""hands dirty"" in solving any crime and he is able to work around the unsavory higher ups that continue to hire him because of his quiet, but take charge manner.

I love his not-yet-divorsed love interest as well as his love of his interesting mother, who he still lives with. There is no bitterness between his own ex-wife and the fact that she is going to remarry.

Seems like Zen won the contest of seeing who could bed his future love-interest. Although he never got the winnings he still managed to punch out the horrid co-workers who started the contest.

4496233,5,B004XKVQKQ,"Aurelio Zen is a fictional Italian detective, (played by actor Rufus Sewell) created by the British crime writer Michael Dibdin. The stories aren't just set in Rome, but the city itself is practically a co-star of the series. If you've ever been to Italy...or if you want to go to Italy...you'll want to see these three films if only the background scenery. This movie wasn't filmed in a studio.

The series consists of three stories based on three of Dibdin's novels...Ratking (1988), Vendetta (1990) and Cabal (1992). In Each story Sewell plays a clever but honest detective Aurelio Zen. Zen repeatedly finds himself drawn into politically sensitive investigations. In each case his commanding officer demands that he take a specific course of action and achive a quick result, while top ministers in the government secretly demand that Zen do the opposite. The poor deticteve repeately finds himself in a situation where his career will be ruined if he follows either set of demands. So through pluck, luck and a bit of cleverness he works his way through the clues to find a solution that serves both justice and his minders.

As great as the locations and scenery of the movies are, the writing and acting are first rate. Most movie adaptations of novels feel like something is missing. Not the Zen stories. The writing in increadibly tight and the dialogue crisp yet understated. Rufus Sewell does a masterful job playing Zen. A lot of his best acting is done with a minimum of words, making key points with subtle expressions. The cast is mostly British, and the British accents take some getting used to. But having actors speak English with thick Italian accents would have sounded rediculous.

Hopefully the BBC will come to its senses and bring this cast and crew back together for some more episodes of Zen.",1369094400,,1819,4.880258899676376

As an Italian detective known for his honesty, he is usually trapped in some untenable situation where there is very little possibility of extracting himself alive or employed, but somehow, he manages.  Set in Rome and the Italian countryside and having plots that twist and turn like Italian roads, Sewell, as Aurelio Zen, a Venetian, creates riveting drama tinged with irony and surprise.  Bravo!

All the actors were perfect for the parts they played, I thought that Rufus Sewell & Caterina Murino had excellent chemistry, it wasn't over the top, in your face it was subtle. I enjoyed everything about it & I want more.....NOW.
I am just hoping that another TV station sees it's merits & picks it up very soon.

4496257,1,B004XKVQKQ,"I loved all of the Dibdin/Zen books.  Somehow in the Zen series Dibdin managed to catch the atmosphere peculiar to each book's location so I looked forward to watching.  What a disappointment!!!  At times, the dialogue was incomprehensible, the settings in many cases did not jibe with the story location  . . . and the plot lines were almost impossible to follow.  No doubt the budget for these productions was huge, but budget alone does not make a good film. No wonder the BBC cancelled. Maybe British accents with no gestures or facial expressions just don't mesh with stories taking place in Italy.

For a really good Italian mystery series go to the Montalbano of Camilleri DVDs. Each one is in heavily gestured Italian punctuated with incredible facial expressions.  The sub-titles are easy to read and follow the Italian pretty closely, except for the @#$% words which are delightfully numerous and easy to understand. . . .and who can get enough of the landscapes of Sicily?

Montalbano is fun.  Zen is work.",1334102400,5,1017,4.866279069767442
4496258,4,B004XKVQKQ,We enjoyed Zen; it is a little different from other British series.

4496259,5,B004XKVQKQ,"I read some of the negative reviews and I think they were expecting a documentary on Italian police not an entertaining mystery show. This is one of the most entertaining mystery detective made for tv shows that I have ever seen. We love mysteries especially those with charming or charistmatic detectives. Rufus Sewell plays Aurelio Zen with zest, with charisma, with humor and with a flair. Sewell said he played Zen as he saw him and as he himself is, not necessarily as Zen is portrayed in the novels. I think he did an outstanding job, he was really entertaining and funny.

The stories were hilarious, intriguing, interesting and especially entertaining. Aurelio Zen has phenomenal luck, an affair and throughout it all maintains his composure. His attitude is that he will do what is right and what is expected of him regardless of the consequences. But his remarkable luck brings him through each case with a success that is surprising yet hilarious. We were laughing out loud at the twists, turns, surprises and the endings.

If you pay attention to minute details and expect them to be 100% correct, then certainly you should skip this series. If you pay more attention to the character, the plot (loose) and the humor, then you will like this series. If you prefer entertainment over a documentary, then you will love this series.",1329609600,2,1341,4.851528384279476

4496261,2,B004XKVQKQ,"Having read and enjoyed the novels of Michael Dibdin about Aurelio Zen, the Venetian detective, I had hopes for this short-lived series starring Rufus Sewell whom I have also enjoyed in other television shows.  The BBC, however, gives us some British producer or director's fantasy in Rome instead.  To begin with ~ surprise ~ the entirety of Italy (according to this three episode series) and most specifically Rome (one of the world's most cosmopolitan metropolae) is populated only by white anglo-type middle and upper class people.  There are no emos, goths, punkers, hippies, homeless, homosexuals, elderly, street performers, nuns or priests, or any of the usual trappings one finds in Italy.  Oddly, neither are there throngs of tourists despite scenes taking place in the plazas.  No bus tours, no country yokels, no groups of men standing on the streets smoking and gesturing, no crazy-fast Roman drivers.  This is a pristine Anglo-Saxon dream of Rome that has (except for a few stylish women) no Italians in it!

Then there is Rufus Sewell attempting to portray not merely an Italian but a Venetian one, despite the utter lack of anything Italian or Venetian about him.  I mean, seriously, what Venetian says ""Yep"" like an American to a question.  Sewell also doesn't ""talk with his hands"" enough to be a convincing Italian.  Neither does anyone else.  If only it were satire, but it's not.  There are no explosive Mediterranean temperaments, no ""soave"" moments, no one even eats anything resembling Italian food.

So what you are left with is this tepid and predictable Anglo-Saxon fantasy of Rome that doesn't connect with reality in any way.  It's a bit of eye-candy fluff if you like that sort of thing or are British or American and like the Disneyland version of ""foreign places without the foreigners messing it all up"".

I rate it two stars because I enjoy Rufus Sewell otherwise, it's trash and I can see why they cancelled it after only three episodes.  How sad that Giancarlo Gianinni is too old to play Zen.",1324857600,8,2029,4.923529411764706
4496262,5,B004XKVQKQ,"Great series starring Rufus Sewell, who is one of my favorite actors, and can do absolutely any type of role.

4496263,5,B004XKVQKQ,"Aurelio Zen is a police detective in Rome doing his best to do an honest job in the midst of the politics of Italian cronyism and intrigue on the highest level, often demanding contradictory outcomes, oblivious to the actual facts of the case.  The script is wellwritten and the acting excellent. The filming of Rome is first class. We bought the three episodes currently available on  DVD after having seen two episodes on public televiision.  I only hope the BBC will make more episodes.",1324684800,2,489,4.7976190476190474
4496264,4,B004XKVQKQ,"I bought this DVD set without having seen ""Zen"" on TV, going by the reviews. I've also never read any of the mysteries on which this series is based, so I had no preconceptions.

I had a free Saturday, and I sat down and watched all three episodes one after the other. I was not particularly impressed, and if I had written a review after that first viewing, I would have given it three stars. For me it is stylish and stylized, and took a little getting used to:
1. Although there's a lot of plusses [or pluses, the dictionary accepts both and I can never make up my mind] to the ""Zen"" series, I was put off by Aurelio Zen's mannerisms - the twitchings!
2. The plotting wasn't as clear cut as it could be. Characters could seem cariacaturish.
3. I understand why a series filmed in Italy by a British production company would use English actors with no attempt to create Italian accents, as the fake accents could easily turn into bad Marlon Brando impersonations. Though Rufus Sewell, as Zen, doesn't sound too strange, Ben Miles, as the amoral Amedeo Colonna has enough upper crust-like intonation that it kept reminding me he was English pretending to be Italian. Vincent Riotta, who plays Zen's coworker, Giorgio di Angelis, is English, but born of Italian immigrants. He speaks fluent Italian. But if I'm remembering it correctly, he starts off with a bit of an Italian accent, and by the end of the third episode, he's speaking broad English.

Three months after watching the series the first time, I had decided to give the set away, when I thought, well, let's watch it again. So I did, and the second time this series grew on me. I could still do without the twitching, but this time maybe I immersed myself a little more. I enjoyed it enough to give it four stars. And I kept the set.

The stories are a little bleak - everyone Zen runs into, criminal and not, seems to lack happiness. It's not as bleak as Kenneth Branaugh's ""Wallander"" series, but there's a definite air of detachment, of everyone out for himself. Mostly this is because political maneuvering is everpresent. This by no means makes it a bad series, but it's not my favorite type of mystery series.

The sun in the series is the incredibly beautiful Tania Moretti, played by Caterina Murino, a genuine Italian with a profile to die for. She lights up the screen as she lights up Zen. But even she is taken away from Zen, though the series ends on an up note.

And speaking of notes, the theme music is quite haunting. The locations are frequently stunning, Italian villas and public places of great beauty.

You get 265 minutes of mystery in this set. Worth a look, though you may be like me, and need a little time to appreciate it.

4496265,5,B004XKVQKQ,"Why do I say ""surprisingly excellent"" when one comes to expect nothing less than first-rate quality from the works of Michael Dibdin? Well, unfortunately, the opening credits of the series screamed ""cheesy"" -- the retro graphics and the music recall the ""swinging coolness"" of the early 1960's spy movies. That was NOT what I was expecting and I began to worry about what was in store.  I'm still puzzled by the intro, because it IN NO WAY heralds the excellence of what comes next.  It seems to be a complete anomaly, for the series is thoughtful, very well acted, full of the essence of Rome, subtle and clever. There is only one other, tiny blip to the production. Catarina Murino is well cast as Aurelio Zen's love interest, but she's the only Italian actor in a leading role -- everyone else is British with very British accents in evidence.  The contrast between her accent and everyone else's is a bit jarring initially, but the acting is of such quality that it soon overcomes this ""disconnect."" Initially, I was surprised at the choice of Rufus Sewell as Zen.  He's certainly a fine actor but one I so connote with historical costume dramas (my bias, I admit it), that I simply never thought him as being the first casting choice. Well, I was wrong about that -- he embodies Zen and plays his role with fine-tuned subtlety and complete credibility.  A wonderful choice. So, yes, I was surprised -- delightedly so -- by how very much I enjoyed this series and I whole-heartedly recommend it to others.",1323907200,4,1509,4.679245283018868

4496268,5,B004XKVQKQ,"I've waited a long time, since ""Cold Comfort Farm,"" for Rufus Sewell to appear in a really great role. Here it is. He is magnificent--funny, oddly sexy, and suitably befuddled, as the Zen character was originally written. Saw most of these episodes on Masterpiece Mysteries and had to have my own copy. Then read the Aurelio Zen books, by Michael Dibdin. This series does not follow exactly the storyline in the books, but works well as film.

4496269,2,B004XKVQKQ,"Whomever researched for the writing and/or scripting of this series doesn't know anything about police administration or detective work e.g. the tte--tte in the police offices and elsewhere were ridiculously unbelievable if not sophomoric. The detective's failure to intelligently think through or anticipate problems including threats were just plain dumb. Even if he is intended to succeed through dumb luck it's still dumb. The acting is wooden (except Sewell has those mannerisms that in a primal communicative way can carry a scene but still a step down from his exceptional Dark City role). Anyway, the dialogue is also sophomoric. The show exists because of the actor's appearances and the usual tiresome romantic triangles. Nothing in the plot structure indicates to me any creative storytelling - it's all too predictable. On the positive side the English and background Italian set backgrounds were well conceived.

It all reminds me of a cheap paperback romance-suspense novel.",1320105600,5,988,5.457516339869281

Zen himself is suave and intelligent, but often swans through his cases, which  seem to solve themselves! The main characters speak in English while the background language is Italian - a clever idea as it makes it easier for us poor English speakers, but at all times we know we are in the real Italy.

4496272,5,B004XKVQKQ,"I have read all the Aurelio Zen novels (and most of the non-Zen novels) of Michael Dibdin. Although no movie could convey Dibdin's wonderful command of the English language, these three movies are enjoyable both on their own and as reminiscences of the wit and elegance of these early Dibdin mystery novels.

The Blu-ray format is recommended for the Italian scenary and architecture, of course, although the solid acting emerges in either Blu-ray or Dvd. The political commentary is biting and spot on. No back goes unbitten in Zen's world of Italian police bureaucracy.

Try these movies, and if you like them, consider trying the novels for a rare trip through the works of a master of English prose, and for a glimpse into the mind of a sly master of intrigue.",1316131200,4,764,4.78030303030303

We accidentally caught the last story from this DVD, ""Ratking"" on television one night.  Didn't expect much, but knew my Dad would probably like it.  I wanted to give him my impression on the first 5 minutes or so.  Well, I didn't turn the channel until it was over.  Of course, watching ""Ratking"" again after seeing ""Vendetta"" and ""Cabal"" made it even better.

The pacing, story, characters, casting, acting, location work, direction, and well-placed humor were all excellent.  Can't wait for more!  Definitely 5 stars for Rufus Sewell and Zen!!!

4496289,5,B004XKVQKQ,"Actor Rufus Sewell`s acting disappointed me greatly in a recent DVD that I purchased.  However, being a long-time fan of his acting, I purchased this series, ""Zen"".  Much to my joy, my high esteem of Sewell's acting has been restored in this series (be advised, I am not dumb enough to think that my opinions matter a ""fig"" to a fabulous actor such as Rufus Sewell).  He is simply wonderful as Detective Aurelio Zen.  In this gorgeously filmed (in Italy) British mystery/detective thriller, Rufus Sewell is brilliant as a rather dense appearing and not ""taking it all in"" detective but coming across as a very nice person that in actuality does indeed ""get it"" and doggedly tries to get at the truth no matter the dangers he may encounter.  He does indeed encounter some horrendous situations (e.g., being stuck in a very tight cave with rushing water below him and guns being aimed above him by nasty thugs plus always dealing with an insufferable boss and some very crooked ""higher-ups"" and ""not too nice"" powerful people).  Throughout it all, Rufus, as Zen remains very debonair, suave and ""cool"".  This series reminded me of a ""film Noir"" type of move helped by a wonderfully ""hip sound track"".

I am very sad to learn that there will be only this season of this fabulously directed and acted series because I really, really adored this season of ""Zen"".",1313798400,9,1357,4.74468085106383

Dibdin was a good writer; this series struck me as a banal (hurried? low budget?) effort. It has little correspondence with the novels. Granted the stories had to be greatly abridged, but so much of what made the novels enjoyable is missing; so much is changed (the addition of new characters, the changing of some character's names--why?), the plots so full of holes as to be almost incomprehensible, that I was very disappointed. I looked forward to the series because I liked the stories and the casting of Sewell as Zen. He is enjoyable to watch, as is the Roman setting.

I do know, however, that reducing a lenghty novel to 85 minutes means the plot will be slighted, if not completely emasculated or ignored. The show has virtually non-existent plots and lots of love looks between Zen and a fellow cop, who is shallow and poorly acted. The actor who plays Zen is charismatic and no doubt could have made a good detective in a show that was concerned with plot, even just a little bit concerned.  I watched all three episodes simply to see Italy, hoping something along the lines of a plot would develop. No plot-- but there were action scenes and some smooching. This was a major disappointment.

4496306,4,B004XKVQKQ,"BBC One cancelled ""Zen"" after one season, but we can enjoy it while it lasted. This story of a relatively ethical Roman police detective, based on the novels of Michael Dibdin, who tends to find himself caught between the highbrow corruption of the Interior Ministry, the lowbrow corruption of his colleagues, and his obligation to pursue justice is more entertaining and less reliant on far-fetched plotting than the BBC's ""Wallander"" or ITV's ""Inspector Lewis"". It's pretty good by the standards of contemporary mystery series, and it offers the added exoticism of being filmed on location in Rome -though some may lament the preponderance of British actors. All three 90-minute episodes were adapted by Simon Burke. I have not read the books, but the consensus seems to be that the plots have been considerably simplified.

Aurelio Zen (Rufus Sewell) is a homicide detective in Rome, where the public speaks openly of corruption in government and the police force. Zen has become known as a ""maverick with a reputation for integrity"", almost in spite of himself. Ironically, the Interior Ministry seems to think Zen's squeaky clean image will serve their purposes well and appropriates the reluctant detective to sort out the most delicate murder scandals. Zen's boss says that ""compromise isn't always corruption; flexibility isn't always dishonesty"", but that isn't helpful when Zen is forced to balance competing interests. He often seems bemused at the corrupt scheming around him, but the only thing he can do is his job -find the killers. Zen's flirtation with his boss' secretary Tania (Caterina Murino) adds some romance, and this is a strong, appealing role for Rufus Sewell. The episodes are:

""Vendetta"" finds Zen as both pursuer and pursued. The Interior Ministry approaches the detective about an old case in which a wealthy politician Oscar Faso was murdered in the company of two prostitutes, a crime to which his business partner Renato Favelloni (Greg Wise) confessed in a drug-induced haze. Now Favelloni has retracted his confession, and the Ministry is afraid of what could be revealed at the trial. They ask Zen to break the case against Favelloni. Meanwhile, convicted murderer Tito Spadola (Peter Guinness) is seeking brutal revenge on the people who sent him to prison years ago, including Zen. Zen's misadventure with a feral young woman in the countryside is far-fetched, but ""Vendetta"" is an appealing introduction to these characters and milieu.

""Cabal"" places Zen in another difficult position between doing his duty and what is asked of him by Amedeo Colonna (Ben Miles) of the Interior Ministry. The black sheep of an aristocratic family, Umberto Ruspanti, falls to his death from a Roman bridge. At first, it looks like suicide, and the Interior Ministry wants to keep it that way. But bruises to the man's face make Zen think otherwise. Evidence disappears from police headquarters, then Ruspanti's lawyer goes missing. Ambitious prosecutor Nadia Pirlo (Cosima Shaw) wants to get her hooks into the case. A man named Masimo (Hilton McRae) approaches Zen with information about a criminal political conspiracy that the dead man was going to betray. All while Zen's endless flirtation with Tania continues.

""Ratking"" brings Zen a new problem in the form of his new boss, the very stern and puritanical Ernesto Heuber (Michael McElhatton), who insists that Zen is a ""glory seeker"". A prominent industrialist named Miletti is kidnapped, but the family lawyer who delivered the ransom payment is shot dead for reasons unknown. The Interior Ministry wants Zen to get Miletti back alive. Heuber has unhelpfully assigned Vincenzo Fabri (Ed Stoppard), Zen's well-connected rival at the office, to assist him. And Miletti's treacherous children Cinzia (Sarah-Jane Potts) and Silvio (Sebastian Armesto) will only benefit from their father's death. Zen's flirtation with Tania has grown into a full-blown affair that threatens to derail his career as surely as the latest mess the Ministry has dropped on him.",1312243200,7,4035,5.231839258114374

I look forward to Zen's future cases, more Roman sites, and a continued deepening of the recurring characters in the cast. I hope Masterpiece has quite a few installments in mind.

4496312,5,B004XKVQKQ,"The BBC has struck it rich with this riveting detective series! Although I have not read the Michael Dibdin mysteries, and I therefore cannot say how faithful the series is to the books, I have spent nine memorable years in Rome, and I can assure viewers that as far as the locations and settings of Rome and its environs are concerned, ""Zen"" can be graded d'oro puro--pure gold.

The mostly British cast are at their usual best, and if the aristocratic English and slightly regional accents among the police detectives strikes an odd note at first (add to that mix the Italian accent of Caterina Murino), one soon becomes so absorbed in the story that the anomaly becomes unimportant. The mixture of British accents is analogous to what would be the mixture of university-educated detectives and the Italian version of police constables, a condition that would be lost with pseudo-Italian accents, no matter how well done, especially considering that Zen, convincingly acted by Rufus Sewell, is a Venetian. The sense of verisimilitude is maintained by extras shouting at each other every now and then in Italian (Rome is a very noisy city). The sound is especially good, down to the two-note police siren which goes flat by several keys with the doppler effect as the car passes by and heads off into the distance.

The carefully crafted plots of these crime stories hold political overtones, which, even though the books were written in the 'eighties and 'nineties, seem equally valid today, as little changes in a city where patronage and politics (and, unfortunately, the criminal underworld) have been walking hand-in-hand for over 2000 years--so long that the very boundaries between the spheres have become blurred. The scene which portrays Zen calling a friend who knows someone, who knows someone else, who can get an elegant apartment rent-free, rings so true that one knows that Mr. Dibdin has actually lived in Rome, where one does not get an apartment by looking in the classifieds but by knowing someone who knows someone else [This timeless state of affairs was parodied in an Italian comedy in which Nino Manfredi played a reluctant hit-man, who outsourced the job, calling his brother-in-law, who called his cousin, who called his son-in-law, who called his lawyer, who called . . ., etc., etc., so that the dastardly deed never got done (much to the merriment of the Italian audience).].

The camera takes Aurelio Zen (and us) into the great chambers of the grand country villas as well as the dense laurel forests, underground caves, and crystal pools of Lazio, in scenes that had me holding my breath as Zen is forced to dive under water (The ghastly possibility of losing a flashlight is one that I once envisioned as I was escorted down to one of the lower galleries of the catacombs of San Sebastiano to view a third-century sarcophagus). The camera also allows us to follow Zen as he walks along the narrow cobbled streets and up the sweeping staircases into the forty-foot ceilinged frescoed rooms of apartments of palazzi built in the Renaissance--impossible to replicate in a studio--grand buildings, the faades of which are sadly marred by twenty-first century gang graffiti. Even though when Zen tells the driver to turn on the Via del Corso, and the car turns into Viale di Trastevere--on the other side of the Tiber--it doesn't matter in the least! It is the ambience that is important, not the exact route or the fact that the street might be one-way in the opposite direction. As the camera shows Zen leaning against a doorjamb of pitted travertine, or it lingers on Zen sipping an espresso, we are there with him. One can almost smell and taste that divine coffee, which, to me, recalls the essence of Rome!

P.S. I just learned on the other side of the Pond that the Beeb has cancelled the series--no doubt, their 'swingeing' budget cuts. Not only is it expensive to film in Rome, but it is also chaotic working under the threat of strikes, which occur constantly.
PSST! I just downloaded the series in HD from I-tunes with a very reasonably-priced season pass. Under the circumstances, I'm glad I did!",1311552000,90,4137,4.872159090909091
4496313,5,B004XKVQKQ,"This is a new BBC Masterpiece Theater series, based on books about Investigator Zen, which started well. Zen is the name of an Italian police officer who is radically different than his colleagues by being honest. He does not, for example, place evidence at crime scenes to incriminate innocent people, and he does not lie. His name Zen is supposedly a Venician name, but it also conjures up ideas about his character, his casual manner, dispassion, nonchalance. The word ""vendetta"" suggests the desire for revenge against the corrupt Italian police system.

 In this episode, a man claiming that he had been railroaded by the legal system and sentenced and imprisoned for murder kills the judge who sentenced him. Then another official is killed. A colleague of Zen had investigated this second murder and overlooked some evidence, such as the missing gun. Zen became involved at the end of the investigative process. A man who was seen leaving the crime scene moments after the murder admits that he was the killer. Now, he says he was forced to make the confession and is innocent.

 Zen's boss tells him to reinvestigate the crime and make sure he proves the confessor's guilt. However, political officials tell him to prove that the man is innocent because a trial will reveal information that is better kept secret. Zen, of course, can't accept either approach. His way is to avoid such corrupt methods and find the truth. What will he do?",1311292800,7,1445,4.885714285714286

If this were a comedy it might work, but not a serious drama. Besides the editing which is very choppy making the motivations confusingwhen they are not being simplistic, the casting if off.
