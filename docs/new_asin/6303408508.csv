7846384,5,6303408508,"At around an hour in length, this documentary is a very informative introduction to Black cinema, including narratives of African American directors, production companies, and actors. To me, the inclusion of Oscar Micheaux - the Father of African American Cinema - was worth the purchase price (Micheaux's biography is an interesting read). I teach a Pop Music history class at the college level and I use this documentary in class.",1404000000,,432,5.185714285714286
7846385,5,6303408508,"Midnight Ramble is a great documentary that goes along with the other documentary, That's Black Entertainment, to display and discuss our story in this country of our contributions to cinema.  A very worthy purchase to add to your library.",1216339200,,239,5.128205128205129
7846386,4,6303408508,"Midnight Ramble is useful for everyone to see, simply because it corrects the impressions delivered by traditional stereotypes of blacks seen in American films up through 1965.

Students of business and entrepeneurship will appreciate the creativity and tenacity of black filmmakers and exhibitors, who built and maintained an industry under difficult circumstances.

Film buffs and film historians will likely be fascinated by the actual number, character and composition of early black films.  The body of work is significant and several of the films are stand-outs in terms of concept and execution.

This one-hour presentation offers diverse input and is well-researched (typical of programs aired by PBS). Enjoyable, informative, moderately slow but steady pace. Recommend for cultural, social, racial, economic and film historians and students and the general public
