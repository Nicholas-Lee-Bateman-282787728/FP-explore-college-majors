3054291,5,B0010X743M,My son is a Sesame Street junky.  We like that he loves Sesame Street but sometimes Mr Noodle on regular Sesame Street Is a little too much. We like that Bert and Ernie are main characters and so doesn't our boy. Thanks,1377734400,,219,4.214285714285714
3054292,5,B0010X743M,My daughter loves Sesames Street. Play With Me Sesame has all of her fav characters with interactive things that she can do with them.,1370217600,,134,4.625
3054293,4,B0010X743M,"I love how Play With Me has little to no Elmo. My boys enjoy Play with me , but I will admit they get a bit distracted after 30minutes. On Sprout they enjoy it but when a bunch of these are together it gets a bit boring. Grover and Ernie always are exciting and are our favorites. It's great they have a platform on this show.",1369785600,3,326,3.9545454545454546
3054294,5,B0010X743M,I really wish Sesame Street would just put them all out on dvd.  We got rid of cable at our house so no more Sprout channel. These are great shows! My son is 2 and it's perfect for that ages' attention span and it's high energy with learning.  Love it and highly recommend them all!,1353715200,,282,4.109090909090909
3054295,5,B0010X743M,My 2-year-old granddaughter LOVES this video!  She never gets tired of it.  It arrived in a timely manner and has barely gotten any down-time since it showed up.  Seller certainly met my expectations and so did the product.,1240963200,,223,4.815789473684211

3054297,5,B0010X743M,"My girls love this set. The DVD is entertaining as Sesame Street always is, and interactive in that they can play along with it by imitating and guessing the answers. We have never visited the Sesame Street site online, so the games were brand new to us and quite a pleasant surprise. The graphics are clear and the games fun for my 4 year old. We are considering purchasing the ""Imagine With Me"" set as well. I wonder if the CD-ROM's are the same in both sets, or different?",1207785600,,475,4.348314606741573
3054298,4,B0010X743M,"This is a nice 2-disc set that includes one DVD of play-and-cooperation oriented films, and a second CD-ROM of interactive games.  Much of it will be familiar to ""Sesame"" fans who have watched the  TV show or other DVD collections, or visited the ""Sesame Street"" CTW website. The CD-ROM disc mostly recycles material from the website... This approach has its plusses and minuses.  Kids who haven't already plugged into the online Street site may enjoy the various games, although kids who have already been online will have probably already explored most of this material.  The CD-ROM versions have the advantages of better sound and sharper graphics, and not being dependent on Internet connectivity to function properly.  One odd detail is that many of the game that loop endlessly on the website often end abruptly here (especially if you don't engage the program)  Although kids may want them to go on longer, parents may find themselves thankful that they don't... especially the ones that feature Elmo's sweet little voice... This collection's theme is based on games and cooperative play -- the video portion includes a lot of material that previously was gathered on an earlier videos... which makes the added games a nice bonus feature.  Like all ""Sesame"" material, it's great for little kids.  (ReadThatAgain kid-related web reviews)",1205971200,5,1343,5.15668202764977

8239210,5,B0010X743M,"The puppet segments are my daughter's favorite part of Sesame Street, so the Play with Me Sesame show is ideal for her.  This particular title combines old-school Sesame Street sketches (the ""Guess What I'm Thinking Of Game"" with Ernie wearing a sock on his nose is a favorite in our house) with new interstitials with Bert, Ernie, Prairie Dawn, and Grover.  Sketches with Guy Smiley, the Honkers, Cookie Monster, and The Count round out the episode.  My only complaint is that I would love to see more than one episode per disc.",1386720000,,529,4.728260869565218
