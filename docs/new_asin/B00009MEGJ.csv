7991819,5,B00009MEGJ,"Prepare to descend into the world of the most dangerous organizations - and men - on earth. Hosted by Robert Stack (Unsolved Mysteries), LORDS OF THE MAFIA is one of the most comprehensive and far-reaching exposes of Organized Crime ever made. It's a real shame that this Set is so difficult to find, this is without a doubt one of the best documentary series ever made about Organized Crime. One of the best documentary series ever made, period. CRIME INC, the documentary released in 1984, is a wonderful series and is probably the greatest documentary series I have ever seen. But in many ways LORDS OF THE MAFIA is more interesting than Crime INC, simply because it covers so many different criminal organizations and so many different countries. The United States, Japan, China, Columbia, Russia, Mexico, Italy, The U.K., Jamaica, even Vietnam are covered in these documentaries. Very impressive list. All the episodes are interesting and very well researched. Of course the host, Robert Stack, is wonderful and is doing ( as always ) a perfect job. His voice always add something special to a documentary, and him being the host of these episodes is really a plus.

Overall I highly recommend this DVD set, this series is really amazing. You'll learn more about Criminal organizations from all over the globe, from New York to Jamaica, from Vietnam to Russia. If you have a chance to buy this set then please do, you won't regret it, this is by far one of the best documentary series I have ever seen and this series will never get old. So this set contains 7 disc:

1. NEW YORK / NEW ORLEANS
From Tommy Lucchese to Tony ""Ducks"" Corallo and Anthony ""Gas Pipe"" Casso, this is the inside story of the rise and fall of the first family of the Mafia in America, filled with extraordinary surveillance tapes and testimony from the men who helped topple their criminal empire....

But when he became the unwilling target of investigations by the Kennedy Administration, evidence suggests he engineered a drastic solution to his troubles.

2. JAPAN / CHINA

3. MEXICO / COLUMBIA
Go inside one of the most profitable criminal empires ever established - the trafficking network that moved tens of billions of dollars of drugs through Mexico every year.

This DVD gives you a little back ground into the SICILIAN MAFIA.
I give this Documentary a 5 of 5 stars!!",1260144000,,163,4.125
7991821,4,B00009MEGJ,"This film explains the hierarchy (boss, underboss, consigliere,
caporegime, soldiers, etc.), the size and names of those (Genovese,
Bonanno, Gambino, Columbo, Luccese.) A large amount of time is spent
explaining the psychology behind the masterminds of those executives,
which is leveraging the possibility of ruining a business operation
against the payment of a tax or commission in avoiding a given
outcome, such as 2%.

The origins of ethnicity-based gangs is natural.

The underground history of NYC is made, discussing Major Laguardia,

7991822,4,B00009MEGJ,"Lords of the Mafia (2000) featuring the well known presenter Robert
Stack, here as executive producer, is a valid series.

With the exception of Vol. 1 which is somewhat archaeological but
teeming with details, the 6 volumes of this series is focused on the
post 1980's era, introducing empire honcho's such as Pablo Escobar,
and others publicized in the mass media.

The only difference, it seems, with organized gangs in 2009, as
compared to 1909, is the speed in business dealings, of homicides and
the number of them, the global scope of activity and the financial
implications involved.

The first volume has Stack explaining the origins, evolution and
outcomes of the 5 families in NYC, coupled with that run by Carlos
Marcello in New Orleans.

The most significant change, obviously, in terms of before and after
a number of years passing, is the public notoriety of a particular
phenomenon, its understanding and grasp by the general public from
the mass media mainly, but also by day to day occurrences that are
often talked about. Early on, the existence of the mob, was denied
and his changed over time, with Valacchi.

This film explains the hierarchy (boss, underboss, consigliere,
caporegime, soldiers, etc.), the size and names of those (Genovese,
Bonanno, Gambino, Columbo, Luccese.) A large amount of time is spent
explaining the psychology behind the masterminds of those executives,
which is leveraging the possibility of ruining a business operation
against the payment of a tax or commission in avoiding a given
outcome, such as 2%. The reduced size of each gang is surprising (100
to 200) as compared to their public persona or image.

The origins of ethnicity-based gangs is natural, (Irish, Yiddish -
Purple Gang, or Italian) to the point of a city of origin in Sicily
at one point being a litmus test in trustworthiness, while eventually
turning into a firefight as Prohibition is repealed and the cake is
too small to be share among  all gangs.

The weight of immigration inflows, as well as the hardships by the
newcomers toiling 12 hours per day, 7 days a week, for insignificant
wages while at the same time battling many others willing to take on
those jobs arriving to American, is reminisced.

The underground history of NYC is made, discussing  Major Laguardia,
dealing with the legacy of Murder Inc (Anastasia), social clubs,
Masseria, a crowded ghetto such as Harlem, Meyer Lansky in accounting
and banking, Costello in payoffs to politicians, Luccese in
transportation,  Maranzano, rub outs, Bugsy Siegel, Adonis, Profaci,
Reina, Gagliano, Mineo and more, along with double crosses,
disguises, infiltrating members in rival gangs,  the countless
number of homicide victims resulting from a desire by an individual
for total control.

The sources of profits already in the 1920's ... from crap games and
dice rooms, heroin, spirits was astronomical,  as well as by
cornering markets such as kosher chicken, candy or operating
brothels, extortion and  loansharking rackets, etc.

Consolidating leverage on a company by manipulating its labor union
is explained to collect taxes, as well as bid rigging on large
contracts  for inflating costs, also done by controlling access to
key sensitive points, such as unloading docks, etc A litany of
examples is given, such as that in NYC for  garbage hauling bids,
forcibly imposing a vendor on any number of businesses at much higher
costs than market in between intimidation and rubouts.

Over time, State, City and Federal levels cooperate, introducing new
tools (Rico, eavesdropping, recordings) to control those behaviors,
as well as ""rolling over"" members, having them agree in becoming
confidential informants to secure hard facts, release the omerta.
This results in a gang fratricide from the ""rat"" being invisible
...the seriousness of charges later confirmed with the discovery of
bodies in various areas.

Over the next hour, the story of Carlos Marcelo of New Orleans is
told, in between discussing the inflows of Italians in the 1850's,
who were attracted by its European flavor, climate and rural
lifestyle.  Much is said about the local mentality - of not only
accepting kickbacks, but soliciting them, in all areas of influence,
or about the 100's of rubouts over the span of a few decades for
control over gambling, slot and poker machines, brothels at times
co-owned by Sheriffs, DA's, judges politicians, etc.

The quality of the narration, commentators, accuracy and honesty is
laudable.",1259280000,4,4484,5.155862068965517
