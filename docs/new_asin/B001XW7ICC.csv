Another release of MST3k DVDs and another set of four bad movies to suffer through.  In this iteration, the films break three to one on the dull dreariness vs. goofy fun scales.  Fortunately, the riffing and mocking from Joel/Mike and the bots are more than up to the task of making the movies bearable and, indeed, fun.

THE ROBOT VS. THE AZTEC MUMMY (1957)
(with short: an episode of the serial, COMMANDER CODY AND THE RADAR MEN FROM THE MOON)

A note to any budding young directors out there: just because you tell your story primarily by borrowing the flashback technique from CITIZEN KANE, it does not make you Orson Welles (although the goofiness of your film's title should also be a hint).  AZTEC MUMMY is the story of a band of hapless archaeologists who happen upon and then disturb a cursed, supernatural corpse.  This plot necessitates far too many badly-lit scenes in a crummy underground Aztec temple set.

As for the battle promised by the title, it comes far far too late in the proceedings to liven up the movie.  The actual mummy monster is fairly well-realized for the time and combines decent makeup and good costuming.  This makes for a nice contrast with the robot costume which neglects to provide the robot with knee joints.

This episode (only the second of the nationally broadcast episodes of MST3k on the Comedy Channel) marks the first time the mad sciences would place a short film before the main feature (Joel helpfully explains the concept of a weekly movie serial to Tom Servo).  The short features the kind of odd logic and bizarre plot twists that make these little film snapshots so much fun.  My opinion of this episode as a whole was much improved by a second viewing.  I was more appreciative of the jokes which really perk up the proceedings.  This is a very good thing, because this type of  film molasses really needs something to liven it.

THE GIRL IN LOVERS LANE (1959)

This film features two main characters.  The first is an aimless drifter.  The second is his younger, dumber, richer prot&eacute;g&eacute; who he hopes to mentor in the ways of hobo-ness.  Arriving in an absurdly typical small town, the pair are terrorized by the town's gangs, Jack Elam and romance.

THE GIRL IN LOVERS LANE is not a horrible movie; it comes across as a fairly banal and uninspired melodrama.  The ending is a little distasteful, but I quite enjoyed Joel's attitude towards avoiding the unpleasantness by simply encouraging Tom and Crow to write their own concluding pieces of fanfic instead.

ZOMBIE NIGHTMARE (1986)

If you were ever to simply list all the elements that would make a film perfect for the MST3k treatment, then ZOMBIE NIGHTMARE would contain a large percentage of your list.  It's set in the 1980s with a mostly teenage cast (which reminded me of the LASERBLAST AND HOBGOLBINS experiments).  It stars Adam West and has Tia Carrere in one of her first film roles.  And, almost as importantly, it's a really bad zombie movie that defies logic and common sense.

With a film that would be funny enough on its own, this episode becomes hilarious with the riffing -- especially in the second half once Adam West shows up.  I think I laughed as much at the movie's utter ridiculousness as I did at the jokes from Mike and the bots.  The host segments for this one are short, but to-the-point and great.  And can anyone tell me why the crime scene investigator is doing a bizarrely inappropriate imitation of Walter Matthau?

RACKET GIRLS (1951)
(with short: ARE YOU READY FOR MARRIAGE?)

I wasn't a fan of early 1950s female wrestling exploitation films until my encounter with RACKET GIRLS; in fact, I wasn't aware that there was such a beast.  But here it is, in all of its sweaty, boring glory.

What THE STARFIGHTERS did for endless, repetitive refueling sequences, RACKET GIRLS attempts the same for female wrestling.  This would be a very hard film to watch in its original format simply because of how long and drawn out the wrestling scenes are.  While the cast is made up of actual female wrestlers of the era (Peaches Page, etc), it's a shame that no one spent much time teaching them how to act outside of the ring.

Extras

The most interesting extra is a two part excerpt from the MST3k video scrapbook.  Part One is a series of host segments from the KTMA days, when MST3k was just a show on a local television station.  Part Two is a behind the scenes look at the writing and taping of the SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS experiment.  Both sections are a lot of fun for fans.  Personally, I most enjoyed watching the writers viewing the movie and coming up with gags, while asking each other for more references and clarifications.  Interesting stuff.

Stinger

The fifteenth collection of MST3k DVDs (the third from Shout! Factory) leaves fans in good shape.  The box set is nicely balanced between two Joel episodes and two Mike episodes; none of the selections is worse than average and the best are classics.",1248134400,3,4990,4.714450867052023
3829357,4,B001XW7ICC,"I guess if you put a gun to my head, I would have to admit that my favorite MSTs are the ones where the film is an overwrought b&w melodrama from the 1940s to the 1960s. One of my all time favorite episodes was I Accuse My Parents (""Here... stab this into your thigh!""), and The Girl In Lovers Lane is in the same ballpark. When the lead character introduced himself as ""Bix Dugan"", even I heard it as ""Big Stupid"", before Joel blurted it out. Classic, priceless, and my personal pick for the shining star of this collection.

I tend to appreciate the really early season 1 episodes (Robot vs. Aztec Mummy) more as a chance to see the roots of the show before it really found its muse, rather than for actual laughs. And I often find it difficult to sit through godawful horse @#$% mid-1980s tripe, even when the jokes are great (Zombie Nightmare). Haven't gotten around to watching Racket Girls yet... but apparently it's a ripe piece of b&w cheese from 1951, so I expect I'll enjoy the hell out of it.

Edit: And enjoy it I did!",1248048000,3,1030,4.359375

3829359,5,B001XW7ICC,"Shout Factory has brought us another set of MST3K episodes for their next set Volume 15. This set is as follows :
EPISODE 102 - THE ROBOT VS THE AZTEC MUMMY - this is the earliest episode to date (only 101 and KTMA episodes would be earlier). This is a K Gordon Murray low budget movie (he also gave us Santa Claus and other south of the border gems) Joel and the bots ( Tom Servo is Josh Weinstein - the only way to see him as Servo or Dr Erhardt is from Season 1) riffle through this OK, but not as good as later episodes when they mastered the technique. It is still fun to watch and interesting in a historical sense since it is an early episode. Joel & the bots big segments are with the Demon Dogs ! This has the short Commando Cody - Radar Men from the Moon Part 1 as well..
EPISODE 509 - THE GIRL IN LOVERS LANE - This is a fun, campy cult B movie with Brett Halsey (Return of the Fly) as a drifter with a young inexperienced drifter named Danny who settle into a town & stop drifting. Brett is Bix Duggan called Big Stupid by Joel and the bots. Bix falls in love but he wants to drift again. Bix also teaches Danny how to survive in the urban jungle & morals as well. Bix gets lynched too in this. Jack Elam plays a greasy bad guy in this. Jack was a great character actor & Crow does a segment to show us that he is. A very good episode and happy it is finally coming out. This is also on Alpha DVD where you can see the scenes that were cut including Joyce Meadows death scene where Jack goes after her at the end...
EPISODE 604 - ZOMBIE NIGHTMARE - Quite possibly one of the best and most popular Mike episodes (this is subject to debate but a lot of MST3K fans did rejoice on this coming out) John Mikl Thor is the zombie (until the ending)killing kids who ran him over. This has the one and only Adam West - TVs Batman. Why he got involved in this is anyone's guess...but you know it is not that awful. No it is not great, but it is a credible movie on its own. A great rock soundtrack (Motorhead's Ace of Spades is the songs intro). A few gore scenes were cut, but for those that want it uncut, toward the later part of 2009, this movie will come out on DVD from Code Red - uncut with a high def transfer.
Great episode, a personal favorite Mike episode.
EPISODE 616 - RACKET GIRLS - This is the one that contains female pro-wrestlers such as peaches. A harmless obscure fun B movie Gangster/Female wrestling movie - that really cant cause Mike and the Bots any pain. If you like WWE this ones for you. This has the short ""Are you ready for marriage"". I think it is a solid episode, not a popular one but I like the old black & white ones. In a way it reminded me of a cross between Violent Years, Sinister Urge and any gangster movie
This set contains the following bonus features.
Glimpses of KTMA (This was the channel MST aired on - a local Minneapolis channel before Best Brains became part of Comedy Channel)
The Design And Speculative Technology Of MST3K: Joel Hodgson And Trace Beaulieu Visit M.I.T.(NOTE - THIS FEATURE HAS SINCE BEEN AXED FOR TECHNICAL PROBLEMS)
New Interviews with ""Zombie Nightmare"" stars Frank Dietz, Jon Mikl Thor and John Fasano. I met Thor a few years ago and looked like Billy Idol on HGH. He is not tall, but super buffed and is a great guy - it was a honor to meet him. He played with his Thorchestra in a nightclub in my hometown
Kevin Murphy And Trace Beaulieu in a Sneak Peek of the upcoming independent feature film Hamlet A.D.D.
Trailers/promos
4 limited edition mini-posters (like you've seen in previous sets)
Overall another great set with some nice bonus features. If you own all the other MST sets, don't pass this up either. A chance to have more good episodes on DVD quality. Not every set will please everyone but overall this has some diversity with 2 Joels and 2 Mikes, and we get 2 Tom Servos as well. No Sci Fi in this set, which hasn't happened in a long time. A lot of fans came during the scifi era that did not catch all the Comedy Central episodes, this is a good opportunity for some fans to see something that they haven't seen before. Overall, personally I feel this set has solid episodes, a historical 1st season episode. I think it is well rounded & I would call this a good batch of episodes. It won't please everybody(no set does), but it should please those of us who love the show & appreciate just having more titles on DVD with superior image quality. Even if there are some episodes we like better than other,the fact is any MST3K episode released to DVD is a good release. Thank you Shout Factory, keep up the great work.",1237939200,35,4607,4.236363636363636
3829360,4,B001XW7ICC,"Mystery Science Theater 3000 Volume XV from Shout! Factory will include two Joel hosted episodes and two Mike hosted episodes, all from the Comedy Channel/Comedy Central period of the show.

102- THE ROBOT VS. THE AZTEC MUMMY (with short: COMMANDO CODY AND THE RADAR MEN FROM THE MOON Pt. 1)
La Momia azteca contra el robot humano was made in Mexico and was released in the US in 1959. From the grade Z costumes, acting and special effects to the mediocre dubbing, this film is perfect fodder for MST3K. If you've always wanted to see a poorly costumed mummy battle a cardboard box style robot, this is your film. This episode also features the beginning of Radar Men From The Moon, which was one of the best things about Season One MST3K. Hilarious!

509- THE GIRL IN LOVER'S LANE
This 1959 black-and-white film features Joyce Meadows and a very young Jack Elam. The film is a hackneyed story about troubled teens from broken and problem homes, but the acting is not actually that bad and it's engaging enough to really irk you when you get to the incredibly depressing outcome of this film. Even the final sketch of the show focuses on the noxious ending of the film. Still, if you focus on the jokes from the MST3K crew then you can get through it and the mostly one-dimensional and unimaginative writing make for some amusing jokes through most of the film.

604- ZOMBIE NIGHTMARE
This terribly cheap and amateurish ""horror"" movie from 1986 stars Adam West. The scariest thing in this movie is the scene where the kid in his white underwear leaves a hot tub. Hilariously bad teen horror that works extremely well for MST3K. Zombie Nightmare is the only color film in this DVD set. This is a strong episode from the post-Joel era of the show.

616- RACKET GIRLS (with short: ARE YOU READY FOR MARRIAGE?)
This 1951 film is about a guy who runs a women's wrestling league as a front for all manner of illegal rackets. The film has a very ""Ed Wood"" quality to it. The movie and especially the short, Are You Ready For Marriage?, both work extremely well for the show.

Extras features include:

THE GIRL IN LOVERS LANE (1959) is terribly underrated at imdb, perhaps due to its lampooning on the aforementioned TV show. There's far worse pictures that score much higher than this one's lowly 2.2 out of 10 stars.

It's directed by Charles Rondeau, who's best-known for supervising TV's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/F-TROOP/dp/B000EQ46HI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">F TROOP</a>, plus episodes of dozens of famous 1960s and '70s sitcoms and dramas. Perhaps this one's best element is an often jazzy music track composed by Robert Stein. He contributed mostly to 'B' grade bombs, worked a lot for Roger Corman and scored such cult faves as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ATTACK-OF-THE-50-FOOT-WOMAN/dp/B000I5R2YO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ATTACK OF THE 50 FOOT WOMAN</a>&nbsp;(1958),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-LITTLE-SHOP-OF-HORRORS/dp/B001O8Z5TI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS</a>&nbsp;(1960),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-TERROR/dp/B0042W131W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE TERROR</a>&nbsp;(1963),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SHAKE-RATTLE-ROCK/dp/6302725593/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SHAKE, RATTLE & ROCK</a>&nbsp;(1956) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DEMENTIA-13/dp/B001J2FZPS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DEMENTIA 13</a>&nbsp;(1963).

Cheesecake lovers will drool over several languid shots of a few shapely gals (including a bathtub scene), and the two male leads are certainly easy on the eyes, ladies! Jack Elam as the heavy is spot-on perfect until he fails to deliver the goods in a final teary ""I did it"" confession.

PLOT--
Two drifters become friends and also romance a couple of small-town girls. A local creepazoid has the hots for one of the women. As she visits Lovers Lane alone and laments her sweety's imminent departure for places unknown, the lurking gargoyle attacks and kills her. Naturally our ""stranger"" is accused of the crime. A lynch mob besieges the jail where he's being held, and the girl's father intends to beat him to perdition.

I enjoyed watching this, bad dialogue and all. It's surely no classic but ""Girl in Lover's Lane"" is far from a turkey!",1377129600,,2793,8.084690553745927

None of the four movies in this collection reach the transcendant awfulness of, say, ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"", but there are many fine lousy moments here. My personal favorite is ""The Girl in Lovers Lane"". where our heroes get to riff on a really stupid ""troubled youth"" story. Also of interest is ""The Robot vs. The Aztec Mummy"", an early episode I had never seen before.

Every time I heard one of their stupid remarks I wanted to go bash them in the head with a bat like the zombie in the movie. If you pay the price they want for this now and trust me I didn't pay anywhere near these prices you are stupid. I'm selling this hunk of crap as soon as I can and if I can't I might use it for batting practice. I would give it 0 stars if possible.

3829373,5,B001XW7ICC,"Episode 102: The Robot vs. The Aztec Mummy with short Commando Cody Part 1
A horrible looking robot, bad sets and terrible acting and dubbing, thats about what you get from this movie. Its a load of well... crap and the crew does pretty well given the limited material in the movie, repeat viewings actually showed it was a lot funnier than I initially thought. Favorite Line: Actually the whole fight between the mummy and the robot is a hoot and the crew do good riffing here.

Episode 509: The Girl In Lovers Lane
Here we have some troubled teens who are trying to make their lives better and despite the one dimensional story the acting isn't too bad. While hokey and pretty predictable throughout many fans point to the depressing ending, which yes is a downer. But boy do the crew have fun with this movie, even the ending. Favorite Line: ""Camera three get off the track, camera three, ahhhhhhhh!!!!!""

Episode 604: Zombie Nightmare
Adam West, a horrible looking stumbling zombie, the terrible acting and it being from Canada makes this quite a bad experience in the world of film. A guy gets killed in a hit and run, is brought back from the dead and goes for the teens who killed him. Its quite a painful movie but Mike and the bots do such a great job making it oh so funny. This is one of my personal favorite episodes, hilarious throughout. Favorite Line: ""Hank Peters, Italian Grocer""

Episode 616: Racket Girls with short Are You Ready For Marriage?
The world of women's wrestling has a dark side involving racketeering (hence the title). There's a lot of wrestling footage that takes up a lot of the movie. Mike and the bots do a great job with this and the short which deals with marriage for a young couple and whether they are ready or not. The riffs are smart and fast and furious. Favorite Line: The whole part of the short with the rubber band is totally hilarious.

This is a good box set and Zombie Nightmare is easily the best of the 4, as its just such a hokey dumb film that its so funny to watch.",1310947200,,2306,4.533653846153846
3829374,5,B001XW7ICC,"As much as I love MST3k, I have to admit that most collections feature at least one sub-par episode.  Something fairly weak compared to the other three episodes.  But this set was all winners in my opinion, no Swamp Diamonds or Catalina Capers to be found, just good, funny MST3k.

I should also say that, since I was born in 1987, I didn't catch a lot of early MST, so while I'm very familiar with most of the Mike years, some of the earlier stuff passed me by.  I bought this volume out of interest in Zombie Nightmare, but I hadn't ACTUALLY SEEN any of these episodes before.  So all 4 episodes were completely new to me.

With that in mind, here's my opinions of each episode:

THE ROBOT VS. THE AZTEC MUMMY
You'd think with a title like that, they woulda brought the Robot in BEFORE 80 mins of the film pass you by.  But you'd be wrong.  All in all, its your standard incompetent 1950's horror schlock.  But I enjoyed the movie's cheesiness and was pleasantly surprised by how good the riffing was.  Being a 1st season episode (the 2nd episode of the 1st season, no less), I expected it to be pretty slow.  The Crawling Eye had been my only previous experience with season 1 and I thought this would be much the same.  But the riffs came faster and were actually pretty funny.  Not the best episode ever, but very solid and I could easily see myself watching this one again.  The robot alone is a riot, it very obviously has a PERSON inside it (they don't even try to hide his face!).  Also comes with a Commander Cody short, which I've heard some people complain about but personally I found it very funny.

THE GIRL IN LOVERS LANE
In a word... AWESOME!  This bumped POD PEOPLE out of my top 10 list and replaced EEGAH as my favorite Joel episode.  Its the story of two drifters that come into a town and one falls in love with a waitress.  Its actually not a terrible movie, the plot is cliched and its fairly low budget, but the acting is solid enough for you to care about the characters, which brings me to the problem some people have with this movie... the ending.  Some MST fans are really bothered with the ending.  And it raised an interesting question for the writers:  What happens if your movie has a dark, toxic ending that's just downright depressing?  Do you still riff?  Joel and the Gang kept on going (how could they stop?), and the results make for one of the edgiest and most uncomfortable 4th acts in MST3k history.  Because the movie's ending deals with a horrible tragedy, the riffing really borders on being tasteless, and it IS hilarious, just in a very uncomfortable way.  I can totally understand why it bothered some people but I loved it.  Overall a stellar episode, as long as you can stomach the ending.  The best on the set by far.

ZOMBIE NIGHTMARE
Total 80's schlock in the vein of Hobgobblins.  The movie is ridiculous enough on its own, but the riffing adds quite a bit (I love when the girl and her boyfriend are talking and Servo is just muttering ""Shut up. Shut up."" between every slight pause in their conversation).  Its got Adam West and Tia Carrera in it, so you know it has plenty of potential!  A good episode, but I found my particular DVD copy to be incredibly dark.  I dunno if the movie itself was just very poorly lit, or if the master copy of the episode suffered some damage or something before the digital transfer, but most of the time I felt like I was watching a radio broadcast the movie was so dark.  Anybody know whats going on with the darkness thing?  Is it just me?  Either way, very entertaining.  A great Mike episode.

RACKET GIRLS
Did Ed Wood make this movie?  It really really feels like an Ed Wood movie.  You'd think with the endless scenes of female wrestling matches this movie would get boring, but Mike and the Bots keep it going.  Very very funny, the movie also has one of the most hilariously inept endings of any MST3k film, just awesomely terrible.  Also has a short about getting married which is really good.  Another stellar episode.

All in all, a great set.  Not the best beginning point for people new to the show (I'd start with volume 1, even with Catalina Caper the other three eps are great intros) but I can't see any fans being disappointed in the episodes on hand here.

3829381,4,B001XW7ICC,"While not essential MST3K, this is a nice set of mostly B&W movies featuring one stand-out episode and a good collection of the show's history.

I have to admit that I usually enjoy the color films of the 70's, 80's & 90's, but this still manages to be an enjoyable collection of episodes.

1) The Robot vs. The Aztec Mummy is episode 2 of the show's run on cable and it shows. The slower-paced riffing has a certain charm and the movie is indeed poorly made, but it takes a lot of patience to sit through.

2) The Girl In Lover's Lane on the other hand is a fantastic episode from the Joel era. From the the running gag of calling the main character ""Big Stupid"" to Crow dressing up as creepy villain Jack Elam, the riffing is great and the movie is fascinating to observe.

3) Zombie Nightmare is goofy horror movie from the 80's that will often leave you laughing before the riffing hits. There are a few scenes in the movie that are poorly lit and go on way to long leaving the MST3K crew out of ideas, but then again Adam West plays a crooked police detective so what more to you need?

4) Racket Girls is like a poor man's Ed Wood film (and that's saying somethin!). Despite the endless length of the wrestling matches, the crew actually manages to keep the laughs coming. Plus, who doesn't love Joe the weasely, foreign henchman?  The ""Are You Ready For Marriage?"" short is solid, with a very fun gag about a disappearing rubber band.

Overall a decent set, but I would suggest buying the 20th anniversary set first, it's definitely the best of the SHOUT! factory releases thus far.",1265846400,2,1589,4.421232876712328

3829385,4,B001XW7ICC,"We're up to volume fifteen in the MST3K boxed set series, and this is one set that will make you wriggle with pain. The episodes are nicely balanced (two with Joel, two with Mike; three are black and white, one's in color) but don't represent the pinnacle of MST film selection. The riffing is generally very good, although the plodding pace of the black and white features doesn't give the crew much to work with. The only one of the bunch I really consider to be excellent (by MST's very high standards) is ""Zombie Nightmare"" with Adam West. I also found ""The Robot vs. the Aztec Mummy"" to be above average; I especially loved the ""horrifying"" robot costume that would have clearly embarrassed Ed Wood. I found ""Racket Girls"" to be a bit slow at times, and found ""The Girl in Lover's Lane"" to be not only depressing, but tedious to watch. There are two shorts as well, ""Are You Ready For Marriage"", which is perfectly hilarious, and one of the endless and insufferable ""Commando Cody"" serials.

The set includes some great additional features, my favorite of which are the MST scrapbook features, though I also loved the interviews with some of the stars of ""Zombie Nightmare"". On balance this is a good set, but because the MST cast and crew sets the bar so high, I had to give it four stars as I didn't find it to be one of the most compelling collections overall.

Vol XV included a very early - perhaps the first season - episode with a dark-haired kid as Doctor Forrester's assistant instead of TV's Frank. In general our family prefers the Mike episodes for the better writing and funnier skits.

Keep 'em coming.

If you enjoy good camp and smart alack robots and don't require high tech CGI then you will probably enjoy this show as well. The only thing is that you have to watch out or you may find yourself riffing on movies, TV shows or commercials just like Joel/Mike and the bots.

Show #509 is The Girl In Lovers Lane.  Lots of trains, hobos and MURDER.  And a fog horn that sounds like a train.  Or a train that sounds like a fog horn.  Full of references, from Land of the Lost, to Frodo and Star Trek.  Not the best, but funny in some parts.  Still, a depressing ending.

Show #604 was famous before it was misted.  A zombie.  Adam West.  Bad movie.  What more could you want?  Well, besides Tom Servo dressed up as Batman!  Oh, and Tia Carrere.  References to Canada and Kids In The Hall.  Welcome to Zombie Nightmare! Hear Taz sing for FIST!  Who is FIST?  Dunno...
""Back to the dolls.""
Show #616 is Racket Girls.  Lots of girls wrestling.  Oh, and a short about Are You Ready For Marriage? Well, are you?  The Robots also try to get married after seeing the short, another famous and very funny point in MST3K history.
Lots of great skits, bad movies and great jokes.",1253577600,3,1303,4.472103004291846
3829390,4,B001XW7ICC,"Shout Factory delivers it's third box set of the infamous Mystery Science Theater 3000.  This set contains four episodes spanning the comedy central years, from season one to season six.  You get two episodes features Joel and two episodes featuring Mike.  The film selection covers everything from a Mexican horror film to a exploitation film about women's wrestling.  Throw in an appearance by Adam West and you've got a bit of everything.

""The Robot vs. The Aztec Mummy"" is the first film featured on this set.  Since this is a first season episode of the show it means the whole vibe of the show was a bit different. The episodes have a slower feel, something that isn't necessarily bad, just a different.  Things kick off well with the first episode of ""Commander Cody and the Radar Men from the Moon"".  This serial provides plenty of fodder for Joel and the bots, with lots of silly costumes, special effects and nonsensical plotting.  For me, the Commander Cody shorts are the high light of season one, and provide the best laughs.

When the feature starts up things slow way down.  The movie itself is, in a single word, turgid.  Huge sections are taken up with lengthy flashbacks to what appears to be previous films.  There are long talky scenes that suck what little energy a movie about an Aztec Mummy should have.  Attempts at gothic horror are lame at best and the dubbing is wretched.  The final battle between the robot (a hilarious special effect) and the mummy is not worth the effort, and the whole thing is just a bust.  This type of film would work better with more energy from the riffers, but we don't get it, and they seem drained by the train wreck of the movie as well.

Shout Factory adds a nifty bonus feature to the disk, a look at the old KTMA host segments.  It's kinda neat to see this very early work by the crew, and fans will get a kick out of it.  Also included are Comedy Channel promos for this specific episode and a double feature trailer featuring this film.

Great short, poor movie, average host segments and good bonus features makes this a solid 3 star effort.

""The Girl on Lover's Lane"" jumps ahead to season five.  The difference in riffing and overall comfort with the show is evident here, and for me it makes this episode shine a bit more.

The movie is a silly bit of melodrama about two drifters who roll into a small town.  One is wet behind the ears, and seems to spend most of the movie clueless about hookers, and flashing his large wad of cash around in front of complete strangers.  The other,  Bix Duggan (called Big Stupid by Joel and the bots) is the world weary traveler.  He keeps his eye on the young fool, but also falls for the nave Carrie, who works as a waitress at the diner.

Carrie and Big seem to have a future, but Big can't be tied down, so he waffles back and forth.  He seems like he's about to make up his mind when, horror of horrors, the director screws up a happy ending.  The movie takes a dark turn when the town nutjob drags poor Carrie off into the forest.  The movie actually offers plenty of funny moments and lots of good riffing by the crew.  Things never really take off, though.  Part of the reason is that the film drags in the middle and Joel and bots get caught in the dullness.  But the random ending actually sparks them back to life and they deliver a solid drubbing at the end, and it flows right into the host segments.  These are pretty funny as well, but my favorite is when the bots come up with better endings than the one the director came up with.

Shout Factory gives a nice behind the scenes look at the show in the extra on this disc.  It looks like documentary footage taken from the creation of ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"".  There isn't any narration, but you get to see just about every stage of the process.  It was a real treat to actually see these elements that I've read about.

Good movie, Good host segments, good extras.  3 stars.

""Zombie Nightmere"" comes from season six, with Mike joining the bots in the Satellite and in the theater.

Boy does this cheesefest of a film provide the ammo.  Pure 80's with huge hair, bad fashions and an all synthesized score, Zombie Nightmere amps up the wattage with some rockin' metal tunes that go to 11.  You'd think you were in for some fun, especially when you see Adam West and Tia Carerre in the film.

After a strange prologue that looks to happen in the 80's version of the 60's, we follow a big muscled guy with a case of hockey hair around for a bit.  He gets hit by a car and killed.  Well, the jokers driving the car don't stop but continue on their merry way.  These wicked teens are lead by one of the most annoying villains I've seen in a MST3K feature. He's such a bad boy that he throws pasta in his mother's face.  Yeah, you read that right.

Anyway the beefy guy is brought back from the dead by a spaz-tastic voodoo priestess.  He goes on the rampage, killing all those who wronged him.  The police are on the case, but the young detective is too fooling to figure out the truth.  Adam West plays the police chief who may have something to hide.

Mike and bots have so much to work with in this one and it's a pretty hilarious episode from beginning to end.  Things slow up a bit when the detective comes nosing around, but Adam West usually shows up to make things more interesting.  The Zombie is slow and non-threatening.  The teens in the movie are pretty bad actors (even Tia), and the script tries to throw a curveball but it ends up hitting the batter.  At least someone get's dragged into hell at the end of the film..

The extra on this disc is an interview with two cast members from the film and how they feel about the MST3K treatment and what they are up to now.  These guys are pretty good sports about the whole thing and it's a fun extra.

Great movie, good host segments, good extras: 4 stars

""Racket Girls"" is the final film in the set.  It opens with a short film, ""Are you Ready for Marriage"".  This black and white film follows the adventures of a young couple who think they are ready to be married.  They go to their local church for advice and are quickly assaulted by a guy who could be a relative of H.P. Lovecraft.  His advise is actually sound, even if his graphs, dolls and rubber bands are really silly.

The feature is a bizarre exploitation film about woman's wrestling.  There is some kind of plot about a criminal underworld, but mostly that takes back seat to scenes of women wrestling (three matches, and one of them featuring women in cat masks), women working out in a gym, and one woman jogging and jumping rope while her... assets bounce all over the screen.  Make no mistake this movie is all about having women bounce around and writhe all over each other.  The only problem is, it's not the least bit erotic or shocking - at least to modern audiences.  Sure you feel dirty watching it, but only because the movie has a kind of grime all over it.

It also is pretty dull.  The whole story about the criminals making deals and sneaking around is boring.  The poor acting and stupid script are worthy of Ed Wood Jr., and I was shocked to see he wasn't involved in this film.

As dull as the movie is, Mike and the bots attack full bore with riffs flying fast and furious.  When they connect, they are right on and funny as hell.  They keep the energy going, even when the movie slows to a crawl and it really helps to bring you along through it.  After a while the wrestling scenes become funny because they never end.  The looped crowd noise becomes a joke instead of an annoyance.  The feeble attempts at a plot are just more pathetic and easier to riff.  In a way it reminds me of ""Red Zone Cuba"" or ""Starfighters"".  If you enjoyed the vibe from those films and how Mike and bots handled it, then you'll be on board for this one.

The extras include a trailer for the film (using it's other name, ""Blonde Pickup"") and a trailer for something called ""Hamlet ADD"", that features vocal work from Trace and Kevin.

Great Short, Good Movie, Great Host segments, Good extras.  4 stars.

When it's all said and done you've got a good set here.  Two three star discs and two four star discs round up to a solid four star box set.  A fan can't really go wrong here, with ""Zombie Nightmere"" being a really great episode.  I've seen mixed fan reaction to ""Girl on Lover's Lane"" (some people are really bothered by the ending) and ""Racket Girls"" (some people find the movie too dull).

ROBOT VERSUS THE AZTEC MUMMY:  Episode 102, made in Mexico 1959.  A little underlit, and slow-moving with its elaborately choreographed ""native dance,""  but finally pays off when the robot gets to ""kick a little Aztec"" (Crow).  Plenty of riffs; perhaps not as solid as later years' episodes but still fun.  The short subject is the first of several ""Radar Men on the Moon"" chapters.
.
THE GIRL IN LOVERS LANE:  Episode 509, USA, 1960.  A by-the-numbers drifter-meets-juvie flick as a disenchanted lawyer's son hooks up with Bix Dugan (a/k/a ""Big Stupid"" in riffspeak), who ride the rails to a town where the only desirable young woman is kept off the market by her overprotective father, and the rest of the girls in town seem to be prostitutes who ""dress like Joan Blondell.""  Above-average riffing makes this one fun to watch.  Joel and the bots sing an upscale hobo railroad song that involves a trip to the club car.
.
ZOMBIE NIGHTMARE:  Episode 604, made in Canada (Montreal), 1989.  Promising baseball player is run down and killed by a car full of heartless teens (one of them a young Tia Carrere), then restored to the status of undead by the friendly neighborhood sorceress so he can seek revenge.  A sufficiently cheesy movie to provoke good riffs, many at Canada's expense. Adam West, wooden as ever, has a smallish role as the local police chief.  Host segments include Crow's giving Jimmy Carter a hug, and revealing that he has another screenplay in his trunk besides the failed EARTH VERSUS SOUP.  A good example of Eighties genre cheese redeemed by good riffing and hosting.
.
RACKET GIRLS:  Episode 616, USA, 1951.  People either like this one or they don't.  The ""racket"" is technically women's wrestling (lots of curvy exposed flesh and gratuitous titillation, much of it from real female wrestlers of the era), and the racket behind that is the bookie operation it covers.  Los Angeles court officer and regular B-movie actor of the era Timothy Farrell plays ""Umberto Scalli,"" head of the operation.  Preceded by one of those life-adjustment shorts about two teens who are hot to marry, but are talked out of it by a kindly adult who wields a confusing array of charts and graphics.  However, Crow and Tom Servo get hooked on this getting-married thing -- the host segments include their courtship and bachelor party, with a guest appearance by ""Jan in the Pan"" from THE BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE (prior Episode 513), who performs an impromptu strip tease of sorts.  The connected host segments, even more than the source flicks or the riffing, make this one memorable.

So there you have it -- perhaps not the very best, but far from the worst, and for under twenty bucks well worth having, especially if there are some episodes you haven't seen yet.
