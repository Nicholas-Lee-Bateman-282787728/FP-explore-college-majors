8144911,5,B000ICLR84,"Even though Roger Federer has gone on to break all of Pete Sampras' records and assume the title of ""Best Player Ever,"" watching this DVD reminded me of just how great Sampras was. At his best, Sampras was every bit as sublime as Federer; it's just too bad Federer had to come along so soon after Sampras's career was over.

This DVD is a fitting tribute to Sampras, featuring extensive match footage and interviews with the players who knew him best: Agassi, Courier, Becker, Ivanicevic, Krajicec, Henman -- even Federer pauses to pay tribute to his idol and predecessor. And for no extra charge, female admirers like Martina Navratilova, Billie Jean King, and Martina Hingis put in their two cents, too.

Special features include match statistics and extended highlights of Sampras' first Wimbledon victory over Jim Courier and his last over Patrick Rafter.

Could Sampras have beaten Federer? When he was on, Sampras could beat anyone, and I don't think Federer would dispute this. Meanwhile, champion that he is, Sampras has graciously and humbly handed his position over to Federer.",1172016000,7,1087,5.027777777777778
8144912,5,B000ICLR84,"Dear gentlemen, you may not believe, but that's true: I have not received my DVDs (both bought september 11th, 2006) so far...I'm sure they must be rated 5 stars, considering the magic skills and personality of the players featured on those two DVDs...

I'm really bored and disappointed, and would love to give my oppinion about them, but I can not.

What shall I do? Wait, wait, wait...",1168300800,,388,4.6911764705882355
