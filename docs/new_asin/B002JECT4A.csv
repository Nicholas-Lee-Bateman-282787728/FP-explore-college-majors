3937646,3,B002JECT4A,"My favorite step-daughter gifted me this as a creative ""gag"" for Christmas.  We expected far less than what it turned out to be.

There are few familiar faces/names (I didn't know Jett was in it - although, I thought her character looked familiar) and the budget for the show was obviously low.  Regardless, the laughs are silly enough and the story quirky enough to NOT be predictable - that's always nice.  The characters are even likeable enough to be funny.

I didn't grow up in SoCal but I would tend to think the movie had some basis in fact of life in Ventura during the early 80's.  And if I am wrong, no offense intended.  None of this matters as this was a decent little show and a good time for a frozen Friday night in Texas.

If you don't take life too seriously, like teenager antics, and appreciate SoCal lifestyle/attitudes, give this a whirl.

So, the gag's on her as I liked this watch!",1296950400,5,904,4.430303030303031
3937647,1,B002JECT4A,This was by far one of the worst movies I've sat through in quite a while. I can only wish I had the hour and a half of torture I endured back. It's a story set in 1984 after high school graduation. The main character has his custom made surf board stolen and he and his friends set out to find it. Joan Jett is listed on everything but has only 3 scenes for a total of about 5 minutes of face time. Lucky her! I'd be embarrassed to have anymore than that in the film. The beach scenery is the best part of the movie. Do yourself a favor and pass on this garbage.,1263859200,,563,3.9043478260869566

3937672,1,B002JECT4A,"Yes,this is a ""if-I-could-give-it-less-than-one-star-I-would"" review.  I was streaming this as a free Amazon Prime benefit, but shut it down about halfway through.  By that point, it had become clear the very thin storyline wasn't going anywhere,  the ""burned out southern California""  character stereotypes weren't evolving and that  the endless stream of vulgar language had become fatiguing.  Also, a warning to the wise: this thing was subsequently re-released under a different title as ""National Lampoon's Surf Party.""  I suspect that re-packaging was done after it became clear that  ""Endless Bummer"" (a weak attempt at a humorous ""homage"" to a famous surfing film) was far too descriptive of what any viewer of this was about to experience.",1434412800,,748,5.443478260869565
3937673,3,B002JECT4A,"For me this movie was a ""so bad it's good"". Somewhat of a stoner comedy despite not having any actual use or reference to marijuana. It's rather cheesy, but is good for some laughs.  Don't expect too much and you might be surprised at how enjoyable it can be.",1426377600,,259,4.285714285714286

3937702,1,B002JECT4A,This was absolutely unwatchable. I didn't make it through more than about 25 minutes. Don't waste your time. Even Allison Scagliotti in a bikini can't make this worth watching,1402617600,,175,5.068965517241379
3937703,1,B002JECT4A,Wow the consummate statement on what went wrong with this Nation began with Ronnie and it's so true it hurts!

3937707,1,B002JECT4A,I would give this movie a negative rating if that was possible.  Don't waste you time on this one.  Worst movie ever!,1390608000,,117,4.2727272727272725
8371382,3,B002JECT4A,It was entertaining enough to invest the time to watch and there was a subplot of forgiveness that gave it some substance.,1459209600,,122,4.590909090909091
8371383,4,B002JECT4A,Lived in Ventura so understood the Vibe. Pretty bad movie but it was cool to see places I knew. Thought is was from the 80's but then saw it was filmed in 2009! What was Joan Jett doing in this movie?,1458432000,,200,3.902439024390244
