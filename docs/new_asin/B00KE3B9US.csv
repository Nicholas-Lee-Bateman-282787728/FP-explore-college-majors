6422822,1,B00KE3B9US,"I absolutely love this movie and waited for a long time before it was finally released on Blu-ray and honestly, I am so disappointed in the quality of this release. I'm not one to easily complain, but c'mon this Blu-ray is ridiculous! I own the DVD of ""Marty"" that has been available for years now, but this new Blu-ray doesn't have ANY features, not even basic closed captions/subtitles. I know Blu-ray offers optimal picture quality and with a black and white film it's not as easy to recognize the boost in picture quality, but I thought it would at least include commentary, a feature about the film, or something for a film that won 4 Oscars, including Best Picture. Okay, so I have a bias and I rushed to pre-order, but this release is such a letdown. So, if you don't expect more than better picture quality from this release, order ahead, if not, skip it. As Ang would say, ""it's a dog"".",1406937600,27,895,4.4969325153374236
6422823,5,B00KE3B9US,"A simple movie that stands the test of time.  Originally this was a ""Philco Television Playhouse"" story that starred Rod Steiger and Nancy Marchand.  With only a few changes, producer Burt Lancaster made it into a blockbuster movie while maintaining its simple tone and its emphasis on characterizations.  The script by Paddy Chayefsky stands out with its realistic dialogue and its strong characters.  The secret to its success is that the viewer genuinely cares what happens to these people.  There are strong performances from everyone including Ernest Borgnine, Betsy Blair, Joe Mantell and Frank Sutton in particular. I have watched it several times and it never loses its punch.",1406246400,12,684,5.238532110091743

6422837,4,B00KE3B9US,"This film is a classic. Great acting,particularly by Borgnine. And dealing with a sensitive subject - loneliness. Filmed with great sensitivity,with great supporting roles from Betsy Blair (as the love interest) and Esther Minciotti ( as the domineering mother ) whose self interest in not letting her son pursue his own life really gives the story grunt.

Overall,I would recommend this film to anyone. Above the standard formulaic rubbish Hollywood has a tendency to churn out these days.",1509062400,,490,5.282051282051282

6422842,4,B00KE3B9US,"Ernest Borgnine is earnest enough as 34-year old Bronx bachelor butcher Marty, and Betsy Blair pulls out all the (non) stops in her role as so-called dowdy spinster Clara, age 29, both long overlooked by any likely prospects for matrimony. This film takes us through 36 hours in their lives within the setting of a thriving immigrant neighborhood of honest, striving people just wanting to make it as best as they can, in the best way they can.

But despite - somehow, some way, this film doesn't quite ring true. Maybe it's the dialog, too polished, measured, lacking the warmth and spontaneity of natural conversation. Maybe it's the way the actors appeared as if always thinking ahead to their next line, and how to best deliver with appropriate drama / comedy / poignancy. And some of the script was written in a recitative style that had to be deliberately paced in order to be effective.

Plus there's the recurring (and recurring) theme of *ugly* Marty and *unattractive* Clara which very quickly became exactly that. Besides the fact anyone somewhat evolved should understand true beauty comes from within, why berate that only the conventionally pretty are worthy of attention? This concept has obviously well withstood the test of time. Please. Let's look beyond outward appearances. Let's not have fun at the expense of another.

At least Marty had this much going for him in that respect. When he began to have feelings for Clara she unexpectedly became attractive to him. During their walk, when he couldn't stop talking about himself, he breaks in, and with sudden sincerity says, ""You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.""

That old chestnut : love makes the beloved beautiful. A very, very good lesson.

The supporting players Esther Minciotti and Augusta Ciolli as Marty's mother and aunt were the jewels of this production. They shined in honest portrayals of a type of woman so common to the past, dedicated to church and family, lost without either, for whom middle age is dreaded because the husbands pass on and the children leave home, and then who is there left to cook and to clean for?

Marty's buddy Angie (Joe Mantell) is rather touching as the loyal, devoted friend who is in the same boat as Marty but doesn't see it that way. He's another who stands to lose quite a bit if and when Marty finally does settle down. Whatever will he do with his Saturday nights?

Based on a television drama, screenplay written by Paddy Chayevsky, directed by Delbert Mann, Marty won four Oscars including best picture and best actor for Ernest Borgnine. It's a slice of life look at everyday folks who work hard, try to find the right person to settle down with, and if lucky get to love and be loved back, while staying true to family ties and respecting the statutes of the Church.

Not a bad premise.",1500854400,,2836,4.761710794297352
6422843,5,B00KE3B9US,The movie is one of my all time favorites. The quality of this DVD is mixed: it's a little dark and grainy in places.,1496102400,2,117,3.9166666666666665

6422846,5,B00KE3B9US,"This is a great movie from a real life believable character
standpoint.  Earnest Borgnine won a well deserved oscar
for his portrayal of the main character (Marty).

I think that Betsy Blair does not get all the credits from these
reviews that she deserves for her roll as ""Clara"".  All in all,
an excellent film that I've enjoyed  watching again and again
over several years.  And BlueRay adds to the viewing experience.",1487980800,,421,4.791666666666667

6422858,3,B00KE3B9US,"Love the movie - but not worth any amount of money if it comes from Kino Lorber. No subtitles, no special - nothing. Most important thing is that it looked like it wasn't clean up at all.  What a shame KL keep doing this. I used to cringe when I bought a Criterion Collection, but after a couple of them, I knew I was getting my money worth.",1465257600,,341,4.014705882352941
6422859,1,B00KE3B9US,"An utterly disastrous Blu-ray of one of the most enchanting 'little' movies ever made. Ernest Borgnine's Oscar-winning turn as the beefy mug with a face like a tub of fresh cement that only a mother - or wallflower - could love: MGM has done absolutely nothing to remaster this for hi-def before porting a tired old and full frame transfer to Kino Lorber Home Video to market. Honestly, if this is how MGM intends to handle an Oscar-winning Best Picture what hope is there for its other catalog. Badly done. I've scored a (1) star rating, but actually it's more like a minus (1). Depressing release. Pass and be glad that you did.",1463184000,7,630,4.584070796460177

I just want to let potential buyers know that this DVD version from Kino Lorber is complete, unlike the MGM release years ago.

6422878,5,B00KE3B9US,"This is a dear movie that I have kept around for years. It is one of my ""the kids are out of the house on Saturday"" go-to movies. I think it is appealing because anyone who thought they would never find the right mate would sympathize with Marty. He is the oldest son who takes care of his family and mother after his father dies. He doesn't believe in himself, but he is lovable and very much wants to find the love of his life. He has to learn to speak up for himself after realizing that he is costing himself his happiness by making sure everyone else has theirs. Ernest Borgnine is just endearing in this movie. All of the characters types are believable and ones you can sympathize with. It's all feel good.",1433030400,2,713,4.288888888888889

But Mama and ""the boys in the hood""  do everything they can to discourage it for their own selfish reasons.

6422912,3,B00KE3B9US,"Many people have complained about Kino's recent (2014) Blu Ray release of Marty.
Is the aspect ration right? I don't know. It's like 4:3 or something close to it. You'll have the black bars on the sides of your TV. There's conflicting reports that perhaps the film was shot with a matte in the camera and that what we have in this edition is extra space at the top and bottom of the shot.
To Kino's credit, the film is presented in it's completeness. A scene of Betsy Blair's character with her parents that didn't make it into the previous DVD version is here.
The menu screen is bare bones. The film's cover art is there with the options to play, scene selection, and the trailer.
The packaging is a standard Blu Ray case. Thankfully those awful cardboard snap cases that Kino used on some DVDs, seem to be a thing of the past.
This definitely isn't Criterion Collection, but I don't think it's as bad as many people are saying. If you appreciate this movie, it's a good step up from the DVD, just not the leap you'd hope for.",1413417600,13,1028,4.387434554973822
