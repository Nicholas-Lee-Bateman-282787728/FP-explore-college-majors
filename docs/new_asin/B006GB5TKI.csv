8497463,1,B006GB5TKI,I had to give this movie a star to write a review but it doesn't deserve it.  Horrible acting and directing.  Did I mention the writing was terrible?  Nothing good about this.  I promise you that most of the positive reviews are from people the company paid to write or family.  The second was even worse.  Don't get me started.,1477180800,,328,4.383333333333334

8497468,1,B006GB5TKI,"This is the same movie as Bunnyman with a different title.  Worse, there IS a film called The Bunnyman Massacre I have seen on cable, which is a sequel to Bunnyman.  This is not that movie.  The real ""Bunnyman Massacre,"" which I think may also go out under the title Bunnyman 2, is apparently unavailable on DVD at this time.  The people who put this out under false pretenses should be prosecuted.  Why doesn't Amazon have a ""no-star"" rating?  Btw, Amazon should cease to carry this product, the intent of which is to part folks from their money for a DVD they already have.",1403654400,,575,4.480769230769231
8497469,3,B006GB5TKI,"""Bunnyman"" or ""Bunnyman Massacre,"" which ever you prefer as they are the exact same film, is a moderately creepy and effective indie thriller. The eerie footage at the beginning of the film is perhaps the creepiest part; from that point forward, there is a decent amount of gore that sits in between some big holes in the plot, some shoddy acting, and a so-so script. Basically, this is a genre flick, nothing more. If you are an indie horror fan, this would likely be worth your while. But for the average moviegoer, there is likely just not enough in the way of substance to keep you entertained, and while the scary scenes are a bit unnerving, there's nothing here you haven't seen before.",1398384000,2,692,4.634146341463414
8497470,1,B006GB5TKI,"Bunnyman Massacre (2012) is only a retitled/repackaged & reformatted version (2011)of older movie(Bunnyman-copyrighted 2010)
Bunnyman Massacre IS the same as Bunnyman.
The movie has been retitled and formatted differently (region 0 vs region 1).
Bunnyman is region 1 and has more trailers.
Bunnyman Massacre is region 0 with fewer trailers. Region 0 did not work on my dvd player.
However, it doesn't matter, since the two movies are the one and same movie (Bunnyman Massacre = Bunnyman).
Bunnyman Massacre is NOT Bunnyman 2, which apparently does not actually exist.",1394582400,5,567,5.382022471910112
8497471,4,B006GB5TKI,"Wow, a great throwback to 80's horror. I saw this on chiller TV and liked it. I was surprised when I got my DVD that it was uncensored with a completely new beginning of the film. The extras were also very entertaining, and I felt they really conveyed what it was like on set. Good stuff. A good film and highly, highly recommended",1390694400,2,331,4.26984126984127
