2752901,5,B000N2HDG4,"At the time of this writing, the only other reviewer has said ""I can't recommend this film however, because it just cuts a little too close to the banality of real life."" He's right. Old Joy cuts closer than one first imagines, and that's why I recommend it.

The dialogue, of which there is quite little, is of so much importance. A brief quip will tell you so much about a character.

The soundtrack, performed by Yo La Tengo, is incredible. Anyone who is a fan of their work will love this film. It is a great visual equivalent of some of their more atmospheric work.

Old Joy contrasts the lifestyles of two friends who have become quite different in their understandings of themselves and their world. These characters are filled with a yearning and anxiety with which we can all identify and from which we all seek to escape.",1171756800,10,831,4.526666666666666
2752902,3,B000N2HDG4,"As kids we all have friends that as adults we no longer have anything in common with other than the past. And we have also all tried to bridge that gap between the then and the now, usually by reminiscing about shared alcoholic beverages, shared girlfriends, and shared memories. This melancholy film directed by Kelly Reichardt explores those feelings of lost friendship and the unrelenting nature of passing time. The simple tale involves two old friends, now on much different life paths, who decide to spend a weekend together in the woods. Reichardt directs ""Old Joy"" with a slow hand that has no interest in posing for you or winning over your approval. She also has no ace up her sleeve even though I, raised on ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Twentynine Palms,"" was fully expecting something extraordinary out of this little trip of theirs. Rather the joy comes from the small things, as in life, such as Kurt (Will Oldham) musing about his overly adventurous trip to buy a notebook and the beautiful nature photography that will make you wonder if we weren't intended to live closer to nature.

As their time together progresses the differences between them become all too apparent. Mark (Daniel London) has gone domestic on Kurt, and that is just the way it is. Of course he has been well paid for his belief in the system, his car is nicer, he actually has a cell phone, and his wife back home is carrying his child. But, as is always the case, he is tied to these properties that force him to lead a lifestyle that is not at all free. The wife doesn't want him to leave, the cell phone keeps ringing, and he gets very uncomfortable when Kurt starts smoking in his car. Based on his choice for driving entertainment (Air America) we are meant to believe that he is at least a self-proclaimed liberal, but standing next to Kurt he looks downright conservative. While he listens to the weighty matters of the day, such as the energy crisis, Kurt is out on the street giving his last dollar to a homeless man. Kurt's world is so small that he doesn't need to know about the energy crisis or Bush's double speak. He just needs to make it from day to day, and without all the modern trappings he is free to do that however he so chooses.

Considering Reichardt's somewhat famous transient lifestyle it is easy to guess whose side she is on. That is not to say that Kurt is given an angelic portrait. His ramblings are long and straddle the fence between incoherent and BS, and he is stuck trying to pull off the look where he has more hair on his face than he does on his head. But despite his disappointment in Mark's decision to go domestic he never criticizes; he inquires and makes snarky comments to the waitress, but is always supportive of what he does with his life. I can't recommend this film however, because it just cuts a little too close to the banality of real life. Why not just go out into the woods and listen to your real friends babble nonsense after one too many beers? My childhood friends became Republicans, businessmen, and weirdoes, and those are just the ones I kept in touch with. What ""Old Joy"" does succeed at is reminding us that it is far too easy to become engulfed in the here and now, and that a little trip out of your comfort zone every now and then would probably do you a world of good. **3/4",1170806400,23,3331,4.4950495049504955
2752913,4,B000N2HDG4,"""Old Joy"" is the kind of small indie film where very little happens or is said, but that nevertheless is a movie filled with meaning.  Kurt (Will Oldham, AKA singer Bonnie 'Prince' Billy) and Mark (Daniel London) are old friends who reunite for a weekend camping trip near Portland.  Kurt is an aging hippie; he doesn't seem to have a job other than collecting abandoned metal objects for spare cash.  Mark, on the other hand, has settled down in a relationship and is soon to be a father.  He obviously cares about Kurt but also views him as more than a bit flaky.  As the two men talk, it becomes clear that they have started to live very different kinds of lives and have drifted apart.  By the time they reach their destination, a hot springs set among the picturesque terrain of the Cascade Mountains, there is palpable tension between the two friends.  However, the tranquility of their surroundings helps ease the stress.

Set in one of the most beautiful areas of the country, ""Old Joy"" is easy on the eyes.  Indeed, the camera often lingers on the scenery - a moss covered tree, small animals scurrying about, a stream babbling through the woods.  In fact, the movie was adapted from a short story by Jon Raymond which was in turn inspired by the work of a photographer, Justine Kurland.  With such stunning scenery and a short run time, the movie zipped by quickly for me.  However, ""Old Joy"" does indeed have deeper meaning beyond its gorgeous cinematography.  Kelly Reichardt's second film (following 1994's ""Spring Grass"") is a wonderful meditation on the meaning of friendship and the often painful realizations we make about ourselves as we change over time.  You can't go back home or recapture those old feelings, although under the right circumstances, it sure can feel close.

Some audiences are sure to feel bored by the movie, which has about as much action as does the typical weekend camping trip.  However, I was mesmerized throughout.  Reichardt's work has been characterized as minimalist, and I think that label is spot on here.  She later went on to direct ""Wendy and Lucy"" (2008), which I also enjoyed and think is worth a viewing.  Interestingly, her next film is reportedly a western starring Paul Dano and Michelle Williams, the latter of whom starred in ""Wendy and Lucy.""  She truly has become a director to watch for me.",1274140800,2,2354,4.751231527093596
2752914,3,B000N2HDG4,"Two young old counterculture friends go camping. Don't have very much to say which apparently explains all the pretty pictures; but it seems there is more tangential photography than movie-making going on here, even as we are consistently cued to a species of wistful existential nostalgia-melancholia...perhaps even some yearning, couldn't really tell.  But there is no real reason for feeling anything very powerfully for these characters. We are not given enough to go on.

Even if the point of scant dialogue is that these two don't really have much in common anymore then it would seem important to show more awkwardness in conversation, etc. But we get trees, running water, and doggie.

I think the director was going for some sort of grand effect or koan-subtle implicitness--the poetry of things unsaid etc. To some extent that is here-but in the final analysis the thing is rather parasitical in that it relies more on the idea of itself...on undeveloped cues to feeling rather than any real clues to why we should care about these characters.

And the thing has the doubtful merit of being one of the few films extant wherein one is left to wonder whether there was a `happy ending'.

I was eager to hear the director's commentary in order to be educated on why I was a mal-aesthete but there is no revelation--the commentary was quite limited.  There was often as much as fifteen minutes or more between comments, as though they had been edited out before the final release. Maybe they wanted to ape the film itself.

But 'Old Joy' could have much to say to someone fresh from the recognition that life-change has intervened in an old friendship--in the same way say that ridiculous love songs come to life for someone recently shafted by Cupid. For anyone else in the mood for an indie `bromance' that deals with similar themes I highly recommend `Humpday' which is  an astutely observed, often humorous but nonetheless psychologically compelling film.",1273190400,2,1965,4.933333333333334
2752915,5,B000N2HDG4,"I read a few of the Amazon reviews, and, of course, everyone is entitled to his own opinion. I got a lot more out of this film than most, I think, because a very similar experience happened to me.  Mark and Kurt couldn't be more different; old friends who try to re-connect. Both are under the illusion that they're happy in their lot, but it seems doubtful as the story goes on. This dual character study was, for me, never boring. On DVD, I had the opportunity to examine the facial nuances so well portrayed by Daniel London (Mark) and Will Oldham (Kurt), in generous close-ups when the moment required. These are fine actors in touch with their material. It's a very simple story, well written by Jon Raymond and sensitively directed by Kelly Reichardt. The unobtrusive score by Yo La Tengo is moody and expressive, and appropriate. This is certainly not an easy story to digest; it's much too simple and intense for today's audience sensibilities. I easily related to Kurt's reaching out to re-kindle the old joy of yore. On a personal level, I've been there. The DVD extras were also simple, and the commentary from Mr. Raymond and Ms. Reichardt is minimal. The story is told well enough that little more needed to be said. The efforts of people who try to re-capture the past has rarely been conveyed in a more straightforward way. If you don't like the film, it may be because you didn't relate as intimately as I did. All films affect each viewer differently. ""Old Joy"" hit a nerve that I wasn't aware was there. Bravi, to all involved.",1271289600,6,1545,4.5978260869565215
2752916,2,B000N2HDG4,"There are some delightful indies that sadly most of America never sees, but no great loss for this one.
Although this little flick definitely does have a certain low budget indie charm, overall, Old Joy is seriously over-rated and requires extraordinary patience because it's plodding, bland, and quite boring.  It's only 76 minutes long but it seems like hours because nothing remotely profound ever really happens  (some of course say, that's exactly the point)

For the hip and staunch defenders of the arthouse genre it will win some hearts. Indeed the slice of life story itself has real possibilities but they just weren't well developed here and Old Joy falls far short of what it could have been. There's little drama, relatively scant(& mundane)dialogue, and only a minimal amount of the supposed tension that garnered it a host of unbelievable and over the top rave reviews. (what were those people smoking?)  The character contrasts between the Cain-Abel leads were VERY underdeveloped and could have been so much better presented.  Even a small dash of something poignant could have greatly spiced up this sleeper and broadened it's appeal.

Old Joy has also been greatly praised for it ""lush and gorgeous cinema scenery"". It's acceptable but not exceptional, not enough to save the day & certainly doesn't live up to the hype. There are plenty of nature doc's that do a far better job.  Is a deep woods nature trip theraputic and healing?  For some yes, but this movie doesn't really capture the essence of that.

""Exquisite....as broad and deep as the human psyche itself!""  gushed Ella Taylor from LA Weekly.
You've got to be kidding.

The dog is fun to watch though.",1269734400,4,1682,4.950177935943061
2752917,2,B000N2HDG4,"There seems to be an annoying mini-genre emerging from indie (and foreign) cinema, and that is a genre composed of films with long takes, leisurely pacing, lots of long shots, and with characters and plotlines you don't see in Hollywood films.  Many of my favorite filmmakers shoot their films in this style (like Andrei Tarkovsky), and some modern directors pull it off masterly (like Abbas Kiarostami, Alexander Sokurov, and the great Bela Tarr), but there are many who don't, and who are overpraised to the hilt because of it.  The practioneers of this horrid subgenre are David Gordon Green (whose George Washington is an incoherent mess, despite stunning cinematography), Ramin Bahrani (Goodbye Solo, despite a fine lead performance, is a plodding mess), Courtney Hunt (Frozen River is a really overrated film that is, actually, awful), Carlos Reygadas (Silent Light is a ripoff of Dreyer's Ordet), and this film.

Old Joy hooked me at first with its beautiful location shooting (Oregon, to be precise), but then ventured off into a real, crashing bore, with mundane dialogue and bland performances by the two leads.  In Goodbye Solo, for instance, the lead character's performance is exemplary, which made up a lot for the plodding screenplay, and Frozen River's lead performances are good, too.  Here in Old Joy, the leads are dull.  Perhaps it's the mundane material they've been forced to deal with.  Actors can only do so much if the script is purposely dull.  John Ford used to show working class people with a lot more dignity and better dialogue than Kelly Reichardt does here.  And while the Oregon scenery is really beautiful, you can see stuff like that in a nature documentary easily.  It's nice that directors like Kelly Reichardt are trying to create something different, but they're not succeeding at all.  In fact, it's almost like they're reading a manual of what an art film should be and working from that manual, instead of working from their guts.

Old Joy is not a good film despite the pretty scenery.  Watch a Tarkovsky, Ford, or Dreyer film instead.",1254009600,3,2079,4.973988439306359
2752918,1,B000N2HDG4,"My wife heard good things about this movie. We were not initially impressed - painfully slow, very dull, stiffly acted. It did not get better. I stopped watching about 30 minutes in...she lasted another 15. Overrated.",1253232000,4,217,5.055555555555555

2752920,1,B000N2HDG4,"The praises of all the positive reviews about strained relationships and feelings explored are entirely true.
However, I think any adult is capable of understanding those aspects and extracting all this film has to offer in the first twenty minutes.  If you picked a conversation out of the middle, you could probably cut that to about five minutes.
It's a story far too mundane for a film and should be avoided - just like the relationship it portrays.",1216771200,8,453,4.8076923076923075
2752921,5,B000N2HDG4,"I probably can add little to the many comments here about this movie itself; you can read as many who think the movie is great as who think it is a waste of time.  Therefore, I would like to address the Bagby Hot Springs experience.  [Like many, many others, Bagby is one of my two favorite hots springs in the Northwest.  (My other favorite is Jerry Johnson Hot Springs in Idaho.)]  First, when I saw these two men drive across a particular bridge I told my wife they're going the wrong way.  And, of course, we learn that they did get lost.  So, if you think you'd like to visit Bagby, bear in mind that the roads shown in the movie, while in general give the feel of the forty miles from Estacada, should not be believed is the right way out there.  Years ago there used to be signs directing the way, but the last time I went there the signs had been removed so you really have to know on your own how to get there.

The movie gives the impression that it is undeveloped, except at the hot springs itself.  In fact, there is a good-sized parking lot and a forest service campground almost next to the Bagby parking areas.  [I have seen a 'milk truck' concession stand there in busy weekends.]  Once you are parked, you immediately go across a Forest Service footbridge over a creek, and then start up the trail, about a mile and a half to the hot springs.  With my family it would take twenty to thirty minutes to walk.  I don't know what trail they followed up in the movie, but it looks a lot more rugged than the actual trail.  There is at least one more footbridge to cross on the way in or out.  So, once again the movie gives you a good feeling of being in the rain forest, but it is not along the actual trail.

What you see in the movie is the actual Bagby Hot Springs,  My whole family, and friends who went with us, soaked in the actual hollowed out cedar log tubs shown in the movie.  There is also a four or five person hot tub under the roof the movie shows.  [If you are a bit too shy to go in the communal areas, there are maybe half a dozen private enclosures on the other side of the communal area walls.]  The depiction of the two friend's soak in the hot water is exactly how it really is.  It may seem boring to some, and it may be boring watching others in a movie, but the actual sound of the water and the many birds chirping or warbling, and even the gentle breeze have a tendency to create a spontaneous reverence arising from Nature.  Needless talking there is about as out of place as babbling aloud in a great cathedral.  So, it may seem that the movie lacks dialogue there, but that really is how one in tune with Nature feels while soaking at Bagby.

Don't get the idea that Bagby Hot Springs is as unused as the movie makes it seem.  I've been there only once when nobody else was there, and that on a miserable rainy, cold summer weekday.  Indeed, if it is a nice weekend day, you can expect to have to wait for your turn.  But, the wait is worth it.  Also, this truly is a family destination; the hike is challenging to children, but well within their abilities.  Our kids have almost always found other kids out there to play with.  Finally, at the end of the movie it says that nudity is not allowed.  Hogwash.  I can't recall ever being there when somebody wore a bathing suit, and that includes toddlers, children, adolescents, adults and even the elderly.  So, if you are offended by the naked body, you'd do best to look for one of the more remote hot springs in the Pacific Northwest.  Therefore, when the guys in the movie go naked in the log tubs, that is how you'll find it if you visit the place, except that also there with you will be the thin, fat, young or old naked people also soaking as well.

In short, I don't think there could be a more realistic and accurate depiction of the Bagby Hot Springs experience than that shown in this movie.  The only reservation would be that the trail to it looks a lot less developed in the movie than it actually is.  The trail Mark and Kurt are shown walking on as they leave is the actual trail.  If you find this movie boring or not to your liking, then you probably aren't cut out to soak in Nature as you soak in Her natural hot springs.",1210723200,3,4233,4.212422360248447
2752922,5,B000N2HDG4,"Despite the corny-looking poster image of two dressed-down guys in the woods, I decided to check out this indie film which had its premiere at Sundance and won a top prize at the Rotterdam International Film Festival. I wasn't expecing much, but WOW! The pace is careful yet easy, the dialogue spare and to the point, the acting style much understated and natural. As a whole the film achieves a rare quality of emotion that burns, glows, then left an imprint on my heart. Will Oldham has to be congratulated for his subtly magnificent acting job as Kurt. He deftly portrays the part of the loser, while slyly stinging us with his two arresting monologues, one about ""worn out joy"" and the other of the ""physics"" of a tear. This is a sad, sad film, but writer John Raymond's thoughts and words will somehow comfort you, as there is comfort to be found.",1207180800,4,852,4.57516339869281
2752933,2,B000N2HDG4,"We played ""Old Joy"" last year at our college theater and the audience (those who stayed awake) were stunned. Nothing much happens in this picture.  It has been praised by many critics as a great work of art. I think that's the same mentality that calls a blank canvas a great work of art. This film has good acting (considering they didn't have much of a script to work with) and the photography is beautiful. The main problem with this picture is the total lack of conflict. It seemed like I was watching a 90 minute home movie of friends on a camping trip. The reason good movies keep our interest is the conflict. Without it we may as well just sit and watch the fish swim in an aquarium. This is the kind of film you can go out to the kitchen several times for snacks and make a couple trips to the bathroom without pausing the DVD. You wouldn't miss anything important, anyway. What a shame!",1200873600,3,896,4.333333333333333
2752934,4,B000N2HDG4,"This film captures a remarkable series of insights into the ways we can lose ourselves and become distant from others as we find ourselves increasingly caught up in the commitments that adulthood presses upon us. It captures the experience of moving through places, of noticing silently, and has an atmosphere and sense of place that is rare in film.  To be young is to experience the world as open-ended, to see possibilities everywhere and what happens with growing up is the discovery that apparent possibilities are not real, and the creation of obligations that come with taking up projects of any sort: to get a job or to get married or to make plans is to bind oneself in ways to a future that begins to take upon itself the air of inevitability.  Mark is married, about to become a father, but still feels the longing to connect with an open-ended past, with a once-close friend, with a nature that does not confine.  Kurt, who tells Mark that he admires him for his impending fatherhood, since he has never made a commitment that he couldn't retreat from, apparently has no job and is on the brink of losing his apartment -- and yet can't bear to lose a friend as well and wants to go on a trip to recover some of the intimacy of a connection with someone who once understood him.  The film captures the nuances of their relationship and of their similarities and differences very precisely, and with unflinching honesty.  The excitement of getting away for a weekend with a friend in a beautiful place is contrasted with the boredom of having next to nothing to say and the muted annoyance that comes when Kurt can't find his way and they get lost.  It is a meditative film, almost poetic, and could be tedious for someone expecting a series of plot-driven revelations.  This is the kind of film in which the profound and defining moments (a brief connection when the two friends arrive at the hot springs) are played with great subtlety and are able to have the weight that they do because so much else is understated.  Much is told here by gestures, hand movements, postures, and images of nature.  In that sense, the film resembles work by filmmakers such as Dreyer and Bresson and especially Ozu (or Kiarostami) -- who have been described (by Paul Schrader and others) as working in a ""transcendental"" style that emphasizes the mundane and procedural and mute and understated and alienated moments so that the experience of connection and joy can stand out without artifice.",1200009600,6,2488,4.7011494252873565
2752935,1,B000N2HDG4,"""Old Joy"" is a movie about a dog named Lucy.  Lucy has an owner named Mark who is about to become a father.  With his wife about to give birth, Mark takes off for an overnight road trip.  Lucy likes this because she gets to ride along.  Mark goes and gets his old friend Kurt.  Kurt likes to smoke hoochie-choochie weed, but this is okay with Lucy because Kurt will pet her head enthusiastically and throw a stick for her.  Lucy runs in the forest and finds a nice big stick.  Kurt is taking Mark to a natural spring.  Kurt gets lost.  The men sit on an abandoned sofa next to a fire and play with an air gun while Lucy looks over at them.  Lucy is played by Lucy the dog.  She has wonderful dog expressions and a very perky tail that wags wildly with enthusiasm.  Her owner Mark is played by Daniel London who was in ""Rent,"" ""The Minority Report"" & ""Patch Adams.""  London turns in a good subtle performance as he says the right things to his friend, while constantly talking with his wife on the phone and being critical of Kurt.  It's obvious that Mark has moved beyond this old buddy relationship.  Kurt the buddy is played by Will Oldham who was in ""Junebug.""  When they get to the sauna, the guys take off their clothes and Kurt tries to give Mark a massage.  Mark is not comfortable with this.  There are a lot of trees in the film.  Kino International transferred it from 16 mm to 35 mm.  It's being called artistic because it takes a long time to do very little.  We get to watch sky and trees flicker by on the windshield for about four minutes.  Actually, this is neither profound nor entertaining.  It's a pretentious bit of cinema.

2752940,5,B000N2HDG4,"Mapping the psychic places where old friendships go to die, Reichardt's two-man (and one dog) road picture subverts the buddy drama with its slow, somber rhythm and air of unspoken longing. Kurt, a flaky, pot-smoking New Age type ably played by real-life musician Oldham, desperately wants communion with his more grounded friend Mark, who denies that anything is wrong, though his face and body language tell a different story. Reichardt's poetic evocation of their bucolic surroundings--birds, trees, woodlands--add to the tinge of unsettling melancholy. ""Old Joy"" might feel slow and plotless to some, but patient viewers will be rewarded by this film's subtle, near-wordless study of amicable alienation. It has the tang of truth.",1185148800,22,734,5.447368421052632
2752941,4,B000N2HDG4,"The political dimension of this unusual film hasn't, I think, been sufficiently emphasized. Both of the central figures, Kurt and Mark, are marginal men, recognizable leftover types from the past century, neither of whom has any citizen's presence much less clout in current America. Kurt holds on to a stale, hip sort of behavior which actually long antedates his own generation's, while Mark, his friend from several years back, is a former hipster, now turned yuppie, a fan of ""Air America,"" married, in possession of a house and with a kid on the way. Mark is converting himself into a work-a-daddy, but he has intimations that something's missing in this recently chosen sort of life. At heart, he, like Kurt, is revealed as still just a boy-man. Accordingly, he jumps at the chance to escape from his house and pregnant wife to try to recapture past youthful good times with Kurt through a road trip to Bagby Hot Springs in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Mere location, as we'll see though, doesn't make much difference when it comes to fostering true human intimacy. One can be as alienated or happy in the beautiful countryside as in the industrial city. To emphasize this, the camera shows us exquisite birds on tree branches in the city and leftover garbage at an otherwise naturally beautiful country campsite.

What these two guys discover on their trip is ""the people gap,"" the awareness that there may be no greater strangers than old friends who've been apart for several years. Intellectually and emotionally, Kurt and Mark have nothing in common any longer; the theme of the film, accordingly, is that of the sadness of time, change, and inevitable loss. The photography, beautiful in its fleeting images of scenery, itself richly underscores this theme.

 On the road, the former friends pretty quickly see they actually have little to say to one another. Therefore, Kurt mostly fills time smoking pot, while Mark talks too frequently on his cellphone. Although both men sense the gap between them, the less direct Mark reveals this awareness only through occasional facial expressions. The more honest Kurt gives voice to it. Finally, he senses that physical contact may be the only way to reestablish a link to Mark. This culminates in a hot tub scene of unasked for massage. Mark at first is taken aback by this regression to adolescent playing around, but when Kurt tells him to ""settle in,"" he does, becoming so astonishingly submissive he lets his defending hand sporting his wedding ring sink passively into the tub's water. Exactly what finally transpires here is left unclear, but what is not unclear is that nothing durable beyond the moment has taken place, that no bond of any sort has been reestablished between these guys. Their goodbyes are accordingly pretty emotion free and seem to come not a moment too soon. As a chronicle of time, change and loss, the film is undeniably affecting.

If it has a flaw, I'd say it's a certain monotony arising from the focus on only two characters in an extremely closed situation. Given this narrowness, the film more resembles a lyric poem read aloud than a dramatic action, and, despite the beautiful photography, this makes for a very long 76 minutes indeed.",1183852800,35,3234,4.917582417582418
2752942,3,B000N2HDG4,"There is a moment in this short little independent film that crystallizes the message: the camera captures the sure but almost imperceptible progress of a slug making its way across a forest leaf with all the sounds of nature as the musical background. From all of the hype that is spread across the cover of this DVD we are to believe that this is the finest independent film of the year, 'shimmering with excellence'. Perhaps for some it will be that.

The very sparse script was written by Jonathan Raymond and Kelly Reichardt (who also directs), the story being a couple of days camping trip between two old friends Mark (Daniel London) and Kurt (Will Oldham) who have become estranged by circumstances: Mark has married and is expecting his first child while Kurt remains trapped in the hippie generation, meandering through life without direction.  The two leave Portland, Oregon with Mark's dog and head for the Cascades where they plan to soak in the hot springs. Kurt is the navigator, manages to get them lost, then recoups  and the two spend a night of discussion by a campfire followed by a day at the hot springs: they return home to their separate lives, the 'old joy' of their previous friendship seems to remain in the past.

Most of the 76 minutes of the film is silent landscapes while the two are driving. There is very little dialog and what there is seems strained by the years that separate the once hearty friendship of the two men: it seems we are to believe that the silences and spare words have great significance, but it takes more than a little patience to paste it together into a story. A few gestures are made in an attempt to connect the two again, but they fail to ignite.  The acting is monochromatic, the direction is flaccid, but the beauty of the Cascades makes up for a lot.  It is a simple, short, plodding little film that may please some and may (honestly) bore most. Grady Harp, July 07",1183766400,4,1929,4.593023255813954
2752943,5,B000N2HDG4,"Reviews of this movie are alllll over the place.  I've been amazed at the variety of interpretations I've read -- not just on Amazon.com but on metacritic and imdb.  Takes on Kurt include:  he's the real idealist; he's unable to give up his college-day lifestyle; he's a kind of street saint.  Takes on Mark include:  he's uptight; he's conceited (?); he doesn't really like Kurt any more; he's given up his idealism, and more.  I could go on...but will only mention the variance in response to the radio program, Air America,that Mark keeps playing on the car radio.  Reactions to that vary from calling it ""Marxist invective"" (LA Weekly) to calling Mark is a wannabe or fake liberal because he listens to it!
I finally decided that the non-obvious, not-spelled-out, low-dialogue qualities of this film allow people to project onto it whatever is on THEIR minds.  That being said, here's what I thought -- and felt:
 The salient feature of this film is its hyper-realism.  We are accustomed to Hollywood flicks in which the world is a kind of plastic-and-aluminum California or New York urban playground.  In Old Joy, though, the world is seen largely from car windows (sometimes it's seen reflected from car windows) and consists of parking lots, rundown neighborhoods, grey skies, tacky restaurants, trucking firms with trailers outside them, and mud puddles.  Then when you get to the mountains, the world consists of trees, moss, leaves, water and sky - but also, trash that people have thrown into the forest.  I can't say enough to let you know how REAL this film looks and feels.  You can almost smell the forest.  As Mark is loading his car at his house, his neighbor is mowing the lawn, and the noise overwhelms your senses.  Mark's wife is plain-looking and seems to be a -- well, a real woman.  Mark himself has quite a schnoz on him (the reviewer who called it ""aquiline"" was being kind - it's a hatchet blade!) but is cute-ugly anyway.
I suppose this is the place to say that the extremely different looks of the two main actors make one wonder whether the film should be subtitled ""The Parable of the German-Scandinavian and the Jew"" -- in which the German-Scandinavian succumbs to his hereditary tendency to depression while the American Jew gets on with practical life -- but if I say that, I'm liable to get zapped pretty badly by certain types, eh?
Anyway.  My read on the movie was that Mark is a good, mentally-healthy, idealistic person who loves his wife and is kind to his friends, even weird friends.  Kurt is a strange-o who doesn't just smoke weed for fun, but has come to really NEED it, and may be in need of other substances as well; he's a loser, and may become a homeless loser before long.  He isn't stupid nor evil, but he's directionless and hasn't made the right kinds of connections to make his life work.  At one point in the movie Kurt begins grunting in a very bizarre manner which I have only heard from men who are mentally ill (I admit it, I'm a counselor).  This is a great bit of acting, but I don't know how nor why other reviewers seem to be ignoring the facts about Kurt - he's a crazy drughead on the way down.  To me much of the point of the movie is that a really good friend (Mark) can offer friendship even as an old friend sinks into total lost-ness, and the Lost Boy (Kurt) has friendship to offer as well.
Am I alone in thinking that ""Old Joy"" is the joy of youth, which Mark manages to remember fondly while moving on, but Kurt tries, futilely, to recapture through chemicals and trips to the woods?  Or hey....maybe this movie means something else altogether, such as:  People who listen to ""Marxist invective"" on the radio are actually closet drug nuts themselves.  Nope, I don't think that's what it means!",1182038400,20,3766,4.608695652173913

I would give this an ""A,"" as a student film, but a definitive ""F,"" as a DVD purchase (or rental). Two guys take a drive to the woods and come home. Along the way there are lingering shots of creatures and things: a crow, ants swarming, wedding ring on finger, and a slug. This attempt at symbolism seems contrived and accomplishes nothing.  Another reviewer said that this film is 'beautifully nuanced.' A nuance is subtly evocative. This film has no fragrance. I'm sure the filmmaker worked hard on this and had the best of intentions, but I just can't get behind this one.",1180137600,9,653,4.441666666666666
2752947,5,B000N2HDG4,"One critic called Kelly Reichardt's ""Old Joy"" the closest thing to haiku that the cinema ever achieves, and that to me is the perfect description of the film. Very little happens in this short, two-character film;  Mark (Daniel London) and Kurt (Will Oldham), two old college friends who haven't seen each other in a while, go on an overnight camping trip, go for a dip in some hot springs, and return home. Yet the spare, telling details in the screenplay by Reichardt and Jon Raymond, and the poetic beauty of Peter Sillen's cinematography, will haunt you for days. The story wastes no time in explaining Mark and Kurt, or in having them explain themselves; we know from the details that they were college radicals, and we know from the details how their lives have diverged. Mark drives a Volvo, has a pregnant wife and an adorable dog, listens compulsively to Air America; Kurt lives out of a decrepit old van, his only constant companion his hash pipe. (Interestingly, the dog seems to prefer Kurt to Mark--maybe because Kurt is more of a playmate.) ""Old Joy"" is a film in which the characters' silences are far more eloquent than their actual words, which usually dance around what they really mean. The delicate, sad guitar music by Yo La Tengo sets the mood perfectly. ""Old Joy"" isn't a film for every taste, but if you're as susceptible to its mood as I was, its last two minutes will send you scrambling back to watch the whole thing all over again. It is a heartrending portrait of lost time, lost friendship, and--at least in one case--lost souls.",1179532800,11,1559,4.689781021897811
2752948,4,B000N2HDG4,"We expect films about old friendships to show us the great cathartic moment that brings hearts together again.  I looked forward to such denouement while watching ""Old Joy,"" a film about two old friends, Mark and Kurt, who seek to retrieve meaning from their past during a camping trip in the Oregon wilderness.

I wanted the story to unfold into the same bittersweet nostalgia as perhaps Dan Fogelberg's ""Same Old Lang Syne,"" recounting the singer's real-life experience of running into an old girlfriend on Christmas Eve.

But director Kelly Reichardt and her screenwriting partner Jonathan Raymond remind us that it is not always so.  Sometimes the feelings of the past are truly beyond our grasp as we grow up and evolve into new people.  The refreshingly honest film makes this point using the device of a friendship between two men, rather than two women, which adds new dimension to a hard yet truthful lesson.

Definitely not your summer action flick, ""Old Joy"" is shot beautifully in the Oregon wilderness.  A relatively short film (1 hr. and 16 min.), it still takes its time to bring you into the experience.  Like a ghost, you really do feel you are invisibly hiking along with Mark and Kurt through flora and fauna, but you cannot open their hearts and bring them together again.",1179446400,7,1292,4.840909090909091

They don't ring true as friends who have grown apart:  both are hippy-dippy; both seem in the same place mentally; and their interests and conversations reflect not a loss of spark, but the sheer banality of their own personalities.  What is it that divides them?  The fact that one is married with a kid on the way and the other is a drifter?  What else?  Apart from Kurt's creepiness, these guys are are blanks.  And there are way too many silences designed to provide the appearance of substance.  This film reminds me of what I have heard is the appeal of Tom Cruise's face:  a pretty canvas upon which one projects meaning.",1179360000,13,736,4.549618320610687

Dark haired Mark (Daniel London) has ties to his wife and cell phone and listens habitually to left-wing radio.  His ultra sensitive companion, Kurt (Will Oldham) has less difficulty leaving it all behind to wax philosophically about the sorrow of the universe and the good and bad vibes he gets from people.  Still smoking pot, he tries to stick to the map, which practical Mark cleaves to religiously for the outcome of their journey.  Discovering the healing power of nature, they unbosom to one another and try to relive ""old joy(s).""  (Never has trickling water--either in film or in real life--contained such healing beauty.)

2752952,5,B000N2HDG4,"The same year when the likes of The Departed, Babel, and Little Miss Sunshine (e-gad!) were nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars, this quiet, commercially unnoticed film made its way--deservedly so--onto the top 10 lists of more discerning critics, namely the ones who were able to see it. Then again, it's entirely unsurprising that a film like Old Joy would be chucked aside like some unintelligible artifact in this era of attention deficit and mass stimulation. What then can one make of Old Joy, a film so culturally anathema as to seem to beg for obscurity?

In terms of plot, it's essentially this: the tale of two friends, one married and becoming ""gentrified"" and the other single and refusing to grow up, who get together for a spontaneous camping trip--a last ditch effort on the part of the latter perhaps to stave off inevitable estrangement. The story is nothing at all more than this. The tempo is a pace or two less than leisurely, but in this case it feels refreshing and natural, not overly arty or pretentious. Certainly, it will try the patience of conventional filmgoers, those who like all of their plot points delivered big, broad, and brash on a gleaming silver platter. Fans of bombast or lickity-split editing won't find anything here to keep them in their seats, so the impatient and the unadventurous are warned emphatically against this film; it will definitely seem like a prison sentence or water torture to some... (You know who you are.)

The film is, by and large, a mood piece, like a lyrical poem or a nocturne. Its function isn't so much to tell as to show, and what it shows is the death (or at least the dying) of a friendship and how it affects these two people. Although the story is as familiar as any friendship at all, it is, more pointedly, a male friendship, a genus of human relationship not often dealt with seriously by film. Too often male friendships are depicted as interchangeable, shallow, and situational, but in the case of Old Joy there is a very pressing sense of loss rarely articulated between two men whose contexts draw them in different directions. In this way I found it very cathartic and revealing.

The soundtrack by Yo La Tengo and the evocative cinematography also deserve praise for futhering the mood of this film, which alotgether alludes to the old joys of life we value, miss, and can't quite regain.",1173744000,17,2378,4.739130434782608

In this movie two friends moving in different trajectories decide to take a camping trip and discuss how the dynamics of their former teenage and perhaps early 20's years is now changing. Typical of Reichardt's movies the ultimate ending is up to the audience's imagination.

8174182,5,B000N2HDG4,"The plot is thin, the pace is glacially slow, and the characters are not all that interesting, yet ""Old Joy"" is absorbing in the way truly memorable cinema is absorbing, because it tells us something about ourselves.

All is not as it appears as the two main characters -- Kurt and Mark -- hook up for an overnight camping trip to a hot springs retreat. Both are about 30. Mark is married, his wife is expecting, and he's tied down to a job, a mortgage, and bills. Kurt is single and unwilling to accept middle-class conformity. Whatever bond Mark and Kurt once had is gone, which becomes evident the moment the two pack their gear and head out on the road. They both make an effort to reconnect, but the magic of their teenage friendship is gone. This becomes painfully clear on the first night when Kurt momentarily breaks down while trying to express the loss he feels over their once-close friendship, and later when he massages Mark's shoulders at the hot springs. The awkwardness is palpable.

We have all known the feeling of childhood friends growing up and getting married, and felt the loss of childhood innocence (Old Joy). We move on emotionally, begin a new life as adults, and find new joy.

We know Mark.  He has dispensed with childhood dreams and become an adult. We know Kurt, too, who refuses to grow up. He longs for the days of a childhood free of responsibility and commitments, and drowns his sorrow in a cloud of marijuana smoke. When he describes the universe as being shaped like a tear destined to fall forever through the vacuum of space, we know Kurt is really describing is his destiny.

8174183,5,B000N2HDG4,"Having read so many wildly conflicting reviews of this film, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. But from the first image of a single bird, I was caught up in its simplicity & transparency, and gladly went along wherever it was going. Somehow it seems as open & immediate as a documentary film, but it has the luminous beauty of craft pared down to the essence. And the story itself couldn't be more plain & basic ... until you reflect upon it later.

The story?

Kurt, a post-hippie figure living on the margins, calls his friend Mark, now married, settled, expecting a child. He suggests a night away in the woods, the sort of thing both men obviously used to do while younger. Mark's wife clearly doesn't like it, but accepts it. A somewhat tense, uncertain Mark picks up Kurt & down the road they go, while the developed landscape slowly transforms into wilderness. Kurt has promised an amazing experience at a fabled hot spring -- although he promptly gets stoned enough to get them lost, forcing them to camp in the woods overnight.

What follows is a quietly heartbreaking exploration of what happens when two friends grow apart, each perhaps a little envious of the other's choices, each longing for something they've lost. The difference is that Kurt, while irresponsible according to the judgment of the status quo, is more honest about this loss & his sorrow over it. Mark has withdrawn into a mainstream shell a bit, uncomfortable with such open yearning, certainly the more responsible of the two but also diminished in some indefinable but vital way.

The beauty of this film is that it never overplays its hand. There have been plenty of stories about the importance of being in the moment; but this one actually puts you there, instead of talking around the concept. It has a reflective, almost meditative flow to it. The less it says out loud, the more it conveys. Kurt's longing for the broken connection with Mark is palpable, never more so than at the hot spring itself. It's no coincidence that his theory about the shape of the universe describes it as a tear falling through space forever.

The moment passes, the men return to their lives that evening: Mark to his home & wife, Kurt wandering the urban desert of city streets, offering some of his sparse cash to a homeless man. It's a deliberately ambiguous ending, leaving plenty of space for the viewers to interpret as they will. For me, it points not only to the loss of friendship between two men who were once such kindred spirits, but to a loss of connection with the country as well. Like so many today, they're both adrift in an increasingly harsh & uncaring world. Where is solace to be found? For any of us?

I agree with those who say this is not a gay movie, but I would go even farther and say there is not anything remotely homoerotic about it; the idea that anything even marginally sexual may have happened between Mark and Kurt is absurd. That possibility exists only in the imaginations of those viewers who imagined it; nothing in the movie supports it. An aging hippie gave his uptight friend a shoulder rub, and that is ALL that happened. No erotic subtext, no unspoken attraction, no sexual chemistry at all, not even a hint of it - not before, not in, and not after the hot tubs.

But movies have to be promoted to somebody, and I do not know what other category this movie could have been put into. Even though it is not at all gay, who but a gay man would even consider watching a movie about two aging nerdy dudes getting naked in the woods alone together? I am gay, and that is why I watched it. There is no category called Middle-Aged Pot-Smoking Slackers Who Think What They Say Is Profound, which is where this movie would fit best.

The scenery was beautiful, and as long as the camera was not on either of the actors it was very pleasant to watch. And the actors were not bad; they just did not have anything to do. I do not like action, I do not need a plot, but if a movie is going to have actors it needs to give them characters to play, and this one did not. The only characters in Old Joy were the beautiful landscape, Lucy the dog, and the bozos gabbing on the radio.",1294963200,4,1503,4.266666666666667
