If you really want to get serious about trading, then buy all of Charles LeBeau's writings and read them several times over.

7799620,2,1592804225,"This is another one of those DVDs where you're essentially buying an advertisement. Mr. LeBeau, on stage at what looks to be a conference, goes through a number of potential strategies such as the use of moving averages, Parabolic SAR, Chandelier, etc. and highlights what is in his opinion the Good, Bad, and Ugly of each. Ultimately he gets to Smarter Stops and the only ""Bad"" thing he lists is that the trial period is only 14 days.

He then reviews, at a very high level, the components of the Smarter Stops, but of course it's entirely proprietary so you cannot execute without purchasing the service. So, if you are expecting to buy and view this in order to actually learn about trailing stops, or the Average True Range (ATR) and apply it to your trading in the manner that Mr. LeBeau believes to be optimal, you cannot do so without buying the service.

It gets two stars because there is some information about stops and setting profit targets (very basic - e.g. ATR time 3 is a reasonable profit target), though nothing you can't get free on the Internet or isn't readily available in other books. Ultimately, in my opinion, you will not get out of this DVD what the title, sub-title, and back of the case say without purchasing their Internet/Email service, and I don't buy books and DVDs to discover that they're hiding the most valuable material, I have to pay more to get it, and even then, because it's proprietary I never really get to learn what I thought I would.

I sure hope nobody paid the $99 list price that's on the DVD case!",1357084800,,1550,4.548387096774194
