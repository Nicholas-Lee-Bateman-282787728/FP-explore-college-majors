8090252,5,B00004U28W,My husband has been telling me about this Wild Man of Borneo video for years now - so we purchased it.  It was as funny as he had said it would be.  The VHS tape is very good quality.  I'd definately purchase again.,1338854400,,215,3.953488372093023
8090253,1,B00004U28W,"I never received this item. Sent several email to the seller requesting that it be sent again since it was showing that I should have received it.

This item was ordered in September and I waited to see whether or not it would come.  The time to file a claim has now expired (which I purposely did not want to do) because I do not believe that this was done intentionally.  However, I would like to receive the item or have monies refunded.",1292284800,,440,4.27710843373494
8090254,5,B00004U28W,"I ordered this video last week and received it just a couple of days later...I was shocked at how fast the delivery time was, plus it was in excellent condition.  Although I'm waiting on my grandchildren to come over so that we can watch it together, I know I won't be disappointed...after all, it IS the Little Rascals.
Based on this experience alone, I highly recommend this seller.  Thanks, Jay!",1282608000,,398,4.671428571428572
8090255,4,B00004U28W,If you love the Little Rascals this Volume has three of the very best.  My all time favorite is the Kid from Borneo.  Spankie is outstanding as a 4 year old who steals the show.,1254268800,,177,4.0285714285714285
