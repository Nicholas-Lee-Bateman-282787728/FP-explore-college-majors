Easy to follow, easy to learn, and very effective! I love it",1358035200,3,115,4.523809523809524
5004161,4,B006ME5A94,This is a great Beginning Yoga  program.  Suzanne moves slowly through the stretches and gives you time to duplicate the position before moving on to the next one.,1357257600,4,163,4.785714285714286
5004162,4,B006ME5A94,"I purchased this DVD because I don't know a thing about yoga and I can't afford to take classes. This is a very simple, straightforward practice that anyone can do. I can perform the movements without the DVD (and with my own music) at this point, and I always feel relaxed and calm when I finish. I'm looking forward to moving towards more complex practices, but this DVD is an absolutely superb start. Thank you, Suzanne!",1355961600,3,423,4.578947368421052
5004163,3,B006ME5A94,"I liked this DVD. It's simple and it's easy to follow. It's not hard on the body at all. The instructor is upbeat and easy to follow.

The issues I had with the DVD is that sometimes the number of reps for a movement is not clear so you end up coming out to the pose to soon or staying in it too long. Some of the poses kept your eyes off of the TV so you didn't know if she had changed something. I found that to be irritating. Also, there is a more advanced movement for a few of the poses but they move so fast that you can't seem to keep pace unless your not new to yoga. That kind of defeated the entire purpose of the DVD doesn't it?

All in all it was a pleasant DVD. I have tried a couple of others from other fitness instructors, the popular ones and it was a nightmare to follow. If you want slow, easy, and not too challenging this one will do ya!",1353110400,24,858,3.8693181818181817

It's hard to fall asleep and stay asleep but this sure does help.  Suzanne Andrews has a very soothing meditation voice on the CD.  There's also more poses in this one and good for the beginner, but if you want a really tough yoga workout, this DVD is not hard, no exercises where you have to sit on the ground and no pretzel poses either.  Great for stretching, getting rid of stress and motivation for losing weight.  Here's a quick you tube video about the DVD.",1350432000,14,1105,6.064102564102564
5004165,5,B006ME5A94,"This wonderful DVD has changed my life! I bought it years ago before this new and improved version came out. I loved the old one but the new one has an even better menu with more poses and you don't have to get down on the floor.  It was a perfect fit for because I needed clear directions with yoga exercises that I could really do! I also got really good results with Suzanne Andrews Pain Free Back and Neck DVD as I have a bad back and am overweight and the other DVD's were too hard and complicated. With this special DVD I feel relaxed and sleep better at night. Suzanne Andrews is the best teacher she knows how to explain what to do and when to do it at a easy pace . I think it's special because I have tried others and nothing compares to this one!

5004166,5,B006ME5A94,"I had been looking for a yoga DVD to practice at home.  Given that I am older and overweight I have had difficulty finding one that works for me.  I tried beginning and introductory yoga DVDs and even tried one intended for the plus sized.  These contained poses that were too advanced or involved getting up and down off the floor.

Beginners Dynamic YOGA for STRESS RELEASE and WEIGHT LOSS provides exactly what I need.  I get the benefits of yoga without the pain of attempting to contort my body into seemingly exotic poses.  Called yoga therapy it modifies traditional yoga poses into moves that can be completed by those whose mobility is compromised by age, pain, or weight.  The poses are simple enough to practice every day.

The 40 minute DVD is easy to follow.  I suffer from back pain so I especially liked the 14 minutes of sitting exercises used to alleviate back and neck pain.  With just a few days of practice I feel less pain.  After being sedentary for so long this DVD has me feeling rejuvenated.  I expect to be losing weight in no time.  Coupled with the meditation DVD included this package delivers what it promises.",1332288000,55,1140,4.584158415841584
5004167,4,B006ME5A94,Think it is a very good DVD for beginers like me. Think she goes a little too fast but other then that I would recomend it. Very happy with it.,1396656000,,143,3.8

5004169,4,B006ME5A94,"Great for older, overweight, out of shape beginner wanting to learn the very basics of yoga positions and stretches.
I have not yet done the program, but looked at it and can see it is just what I wanted and need.

I am writing this review early because I am annoyed with the DVD quality itself. The primary DVD was loose inside the package and so the back was scratched up. Worse, the quality of the DVD is poor, and at the bottom of the image there is a fuzziness. To me, it appears like a pirated copy.  I recommend buying the DVD from somewhere else.",1392595200,,554,4.216981132075472
5004170,3,B006ME5A94,"Can anyone tell me if this contains poses that require you to support your body weight with your arms? Arthritis in my arm makes that impossible, so I'm looking for non-weight bearing poses. Thanks!",1386374400,2,198,4.852941176470588

5004172,5,B006ME5A94,"It feels good to actually be able to do the yoga positions shown on this video. The breathing is particularly helpful and I think I""m off to a good start.",1365897600,3,154,4.166666666666667
5004173,5,B006ME5A94,"I am new to Yoga and have a spinal injury from a car accident several years ago. In reading several reviews that recommended this dvd, I grudgingly purchased it still believing that it would not be for me. The instructor has classes on PBS...that was my first sign that I probably was not going to get anything out of this.  However, out of the few dvds that I purchased, this ended up being my favorite.  She takes you through the progressions with several repititions so that you can follow along.  Honestly, this gave me the most gentle stretch to my injured back.  After doing the workout, I immediately slept better and for the first time in several years, woke up with no pain.  I also appreciated that there was more concentration on the core exercises itself and less on the spirituality.  For beginners or those with injuries, she offers modified poses to suit your needs.  I have recommended this video to several of my friends with similar physical limitations.",1365552000,9,972,4.715976331360947
5004174,5,B006ME5A94,"Love this Yoga DVD! I looked over many and this one had excellent ratings so I thought I would see for myself. It is easy to follow, just like the reviews said it would be. I am a beginner and this is a perfect DVD for us beginners and also for those of us that want to lose weight.",1362960000,3,282,3.7966101694915255
5004175,5,B006ME5A94,"I really like that she takes it slow
so you can learn how to do the poses properly .
I have followed her teaching for 2 weeks now.
A few days ago I made a chart listing all the poses she has demonstrated...
I have purchased some tranquil music from Itunes.
Now , I just flow from one pose to the other without needing to watch her CD",1360022400,12,333,3.911764705882353

We loved this DVD as it has basic, sound moves that are well demonstrated.  Ms. Andrews does a very good job & we feel great after following her yoga routines.",1358294400,8,319,4.213114754098361

8500675,1,B006ME5A94,"I did not care for this Dvd at all. The first practice would hardly even be called a warm up for 14 minutes. The second practice was done on the beach and the person's body is totally shadowed out. I bought this one because of the reviews but this is not a good dvd for people who truly want to begin a yoga practice and learn proper form. I have over 30 dvds and this one would not be in my top 20 even. Gentle Yoga is a good one that offers chair practices, practices where u use a chair as u would the floor or even practices where u can sit if u are unable to get up and down from the floor. There are many to choose from.",1442534400,,626,3.8230769230769233

8500681,1,B006ME5A94,"I purchased this DVD based on all of the other wonderful, glowing five-star reviews.  I disliked this yoga practice for several reasons.  First, the sequencing seemed to be off.  There were many times when I would be just getting into a pose and the narrator would already be moving on to another pose.  It felt disjointed to me.

Another thing that bothered me was the fact that the scenery kept changing for each pose.  There was one scene where you couldn't even see the person doing the pose  (I assume it was Suzanne), but rather just her silhouette.  This constant changing of scenes also added to the disjointed feeling.

Finally, I purchased this video for stress release.  I did not feel more relaxed after doing it, but rather more stressed knowing that I paid X amount for a DVD I would never use again.  I cannot recommend this yoga practice.",1399075200,3,854,4.626666666666667
