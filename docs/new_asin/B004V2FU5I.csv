Thus Deepti Naval, a doctor, marries to Farooq Shaikh in disguise of being a village-girl and the story goes on, eventually having the father realise that his idea about english-educated females was incorrect.

Of course the idea here is not so relevant. It is the simply comic situations that get created one after the other. Its a hilarious movie but doesn't create big laughters. The movie does not stand out as a great comedy or a great movie in any sense but is surely a worth watch because its a great combination of nice script, nice direction, nice acting etc. It has everything good.",1305849600,,856,4.7
