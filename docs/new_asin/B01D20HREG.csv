8754687,5,B01D20HREG,"Didnt know what to expect going into this one but I really enjoyed this release. Over 12 hours of various short pornographic films from the early 1970s. If you ever wanted to know what it was like to be in adult movie theatre during this time, then this is the release to get! All of the movies have been sourced from 16mm, so be prepared for the upright bars on your screen. They also come complete with scratches and are somewhat damaged prints, but they are not faded and are relatively clean. This is the way these shorts are to be seen. It adds to the whole vibe. Great release ! Highly recommend",1511913600,,601,4.327433628318584

8754690,3,B01D20HREG,Another collection of vintage pornography. Some film's were better than others. It was evident that adult film's  are far better now. Most of the film's were cheap thrills for those who used to  watched them in old theaters.,1473724800,2,224,4.868421052631579
8754691,4,B01D20HREG,"Vinegar Syndrome chose a poster artwork style appropriate to the nostalgic content of this huge package, rather than giving us much detail about what is inside. So let me lay it out, having watched the set attentively from start to finish. Here, in order, are the 12 feature titles and 2 shorts in this 3-DVD collection of early 70s films:

Girl Acrobatics (director unknown, approx. 5 minutes).
An embarrassingly poor novelty film of homemade quality and no interest other than to document its own existence. 0/5

Homer, the Late Comer (Ian De Praved, approx. 57 minutes).
A vaguely entertaining comedy about the fantasies of a 50-year-old film editor who still lives with his mother. 2/5

Erotic Point of View (director unknown, approx. 60 minutes).
The beginning of the film introduces our main female character who is so  *atypical* seems an accurate word  that I needed to stop and watch again to make sure I was understanding correctly. Diverse scenes are presented in unusual contexts, including an uncomfortable scene that successfully conveys abuse through non-consent. A unique and somewhat fascinating film. 3/5

Porno Mondo (Federico Schwartz, approx. 60 minutes).
This pseudo-documentary about the adult film industry is much better than expected. Good acting, well written, sexy, and re-watchable. 4/5

Sex Before Marriage (director unknown, approx. 61 minutes).
The detours and delays of a young man trying to get to his wedding. Each scene contains two sentences of plot dialogue repeated 40 times. The male lead tries his best to make the film work, considering the script written on a gum wrapper and a very unattractive cast. 2/5

Orgy in the Woods (director unknown, approx. 18 minutes)
A poor amateur work. 1/5

The Playboys (Swinging Playboys) (Jimmy DeKnight, approx. 54 minutes)
Entertaining in an old-fashioned way, with a silly sit-com plot of one man trying to keep three girls occupied in three different rooms. One of the girls is a great 60s hottie. This naughty version of a story youve seen many times before asks the musical question What would Greg Brady Do? 3/5

Suckula (Sam Weston, approx. 58 minutes)
I enjoyed this very much despite the so-so comedic newscaster who anchors the sequences. The acting is well above average, informed comedy by the Dracula character is entertaining rather than annoying, and some sequences are very sexy. The vignettes have stylistic variety and are accompanied by well-selected enjoyable music of the period rather than music library sludge. This director knows something about fine film. The presentation is smart and some scenes show influences of Robert Downey Sr. and Kenneth Anger. 5/5

The Big Snatch (Mark Hunter, approx. 60 minutes)
The beginning is surprisingly violent and includes a tutorial on shooting heroin. [They don't make em like that anymore . . .] The middle is plodding and uninteresting, but the last two scenes are excellent and compensate for a lot. Perhaps the director saw that the film had finally come to a nice head  and wisely decided to repeat the action with the same talent. The hurried wrap-up returns to atypical violence, stupid and over quickly, but still hurts the good direction the film was headed. 4/5

The Erotic Adventures of Hercules (Ri Taziner, approx. 58 minutes)
Really ugly visual quality throughout. The endless first scene after the titles is truly repulsive, with long facial close-ups of a grotesque man eating like a pig, over-dubbed with loud grunts that are both gastronomic and sexual. Barbaric over-grunting, milquetoast narration, and dumb music compete in a jumbled mess throughout, making the audio as ugly as the video. 0/5

Shot on Location (John Donne, approx. 61 minutes)
The intro and first scene are promising, but the script becomes overly devoted to an uninteresting plot. Too many cast members are distractingly unattractive. 2/5

The Touch (director unknown, approx. 62 minutes)
Same as Shot on Location: Excessive talk about a barely comprehensible plot and indiscriminate use of the Ugly Stick. These two films blur into a jumble of disinterest. 2/5

Carnal Go-Round (director unknown, approx. 63 minutes)
Valuable as a document of ambitious homemade film. The female lead is rehearsed and understands the story. The other characters seem to have been offered $20 each in the bread aisle of the A&P two minutes before shooting began at the directors house a block away. A truly unique moment in film history decides upon a Coyote & Road Runner bedspread that happens to be on set as the films symbolic and artistic nucleus. 2/5

All-American Hustler (Huck Walker, approx. 65 minutes)
This is the other truly well-made film in the set. While Suckula might play best to an audience that knows a little about subcultural film, All-American Hustler passes as a main stream early 70s drama that just happens to have explicit content. Attention was paid to wardrobe and costuming, characters have realistic relationships and motivations, and the script is spared the mind-numbing idiocy found in most plots at this level. But this is not a soft movie or Hollywood fare with a naughty scene. The action is heavy, explicit, and frequent. The audio, muffled and difficult to understand a few places, is the only technical attribute that falls significantly short of 2nd-tier production from a real studio. Ive sat through many movies with big names both on stage and in the directors chair that were far worse in every way. 5/5

In short, I find Suckula, All-American Hustler, Porno Mondo and Erotic Point of View worth the cost of the set, and I look forward to revisiting them for various reasons. Most of the others were marginally entertaining or good for a little light nostalgia, leaving only the two shorts and Hercules as completely awful, even viewed in an appropriate historical context.",1464998400,30,5832,5.101783840503672
8754692,1,B01D20HREG,If  I knew these were a series of shorts I would not have bought these. I thought these were movies .,1463356800,10,101,3.8095238095238093
8754693,3,B01D20HREG,"This three disc set is interesting for what it is
But, it's not for everyone
I'm sure 16mm collector's/fans might already have some of these on real 16mm film stock

These are the types of 16mm films you'd see someone like a
Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez, Hugh Hefner or Larry Flynt running during a party

I would've never bought this 3 disc set alone (It was in the  Vinegar Syndrome April combo package) It was pretty much free
You can tell there was a lot of attention to detail put into the look and feel of the box and all the info in the package
It's super interesting but, really not sure who this is made for.....
I guess if you are a hardcore 16mm collector/fan you'll dig it for a sleazy 1970's nostalgia
you get lots of bang for your buck with 12 hours
The print used in this collection were salvaged from long shuttered projection booths and forgotten back rooms
some of the footage has Cigarette Burns, all types of print damage
With all honesty this add a oddball charm to it
It's very organic even though at times you might think you'll about to witness a snuff film
I can respect what Vinegar Syndrome did with this collection but,
It's hard to recommend this collection overall  cause it's so retro and niche
Anyone who grew up around the time of the 42nd Street underground/grind house movement will probably dig this",1461715200,14,1342,4.510288065843621
