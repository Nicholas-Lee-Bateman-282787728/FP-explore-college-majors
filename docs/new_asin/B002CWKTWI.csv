I am Rafael Nadal's biggest fan & this DVD has been played a million times, I love it! Rafa won his 1st hardcourt grand slam & made his fans very happy!

I was as exhausted as the players must have been when it finished because when you're watching as a fan and you really, really want your man to win, you go through all the highs and lows with them and feel worn out by the end (but very very happy!)

Sorry for Federer fans, you won't enjoy it as much as I did because he lost but you'll still find it an entertaining match & he has won lots of Grand Slams!

Other Rafa fans will love this book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Poetry-of-Passion-for-People-with-a-Pulse/dp/0956526608/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Poetry of Passion (for People with a Pulse)</a>&nbsp;it's got 80 poems in about how us fans feel about him, the highs the lows and his lovely humble personality and his sexy looks, and the other poems about love are good too.",1298419200,,1027,4.988304093567251
3907250,5,B002CWKTWI,"Luckily I have a multi region DVD player (although I didn't check before buying it!) but I'd advise you to do so (I'm from the UK)

I'm a huge Rafael nadal fan & I buy almost everything Rafa related, this match is an absolute must, a nailbiting, classic match with Rafa winning his 1st hard court grand slam title.

It's definately one of the great Rafa/Federer matches, one to treasure & watch again & again.

Rafa fans will also love the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Poetry-of-Passion-for-People-with-a-Pulse/dp/0956526608/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Poetry of Passion (for People with a Pulse)</a>&nbsp;as it has a long chapter called ""A Fan's Feelings"" of 80 poems about Rafa, his career, his personality & his good looks (& the rest of the book is brilliant too) No Rafa fan should be without it!",1298332800,,859,5.541984732824427
3907251,5,B002CWKTWI,"I'm a big tennis fan, and it's always fun to watch the two greatest tennis players of our time going manno-a-manno.  So imagine my surprise when I searched for Wimbledon DVD's and then this pops-up.  The Australian Open 2009 Men's Final - Federer Vs. Nadal.  I did not realize that a DVD of one of their best championship matches was just released.  Glad to have ordered it.  The delivery time (if I can remember correctly) was just 4 days.  The sound and picture quality was excellent.  The best part is THERE WERE NO INTERUPTIONS (ie. no commercial breaks)!  You, the viewer, get to watch the entire match.  Yes, even what was happening during their break periods.  So you get to witness their usual habits between service games.  It was as if you were actually there at the stadium instead of being at home watching it on TV and waiting for the commercial breaks to end.  The broadcast was done by an Australian broadcasting company.  And they did a bang-up job of it.  They used just the right amount of slo-mo replays, and computer graphics to illustrate the nuances of the match.  In other words, nothing was overdone, or underdone.  As for the match itself, all I can say is it's Federer and Nadal...'nuff said!  This is a must for any serious tennis fan.",1284076800,8,1262,4.5874439461883405
3907252,5,B002CWKTWI,"After the epic match of Wimbledon 2008, Nadal and Federer again
produced another classic mathc of all time. ( if only taking Australian open, I would this this is the greatest final
in Ausralian Ope ). The quality of play is very high and mixed
with some unforced errors making the match EVEN more thrilling and excited !!!!",1280448000,,324,4.603448275862069
3907253,4,B002CWKTWI,"Although this final match between Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer was very good; the semi-final played between Rafael Nadal and Fernando Verdasco was fantasic! They played for 5 hours and 14 minutes. The scores were very close, and Verdasco played the hardest and the best that I have ever seen him play. I think Rafa was surprise in the beginning by Verdasco's power and tenacity, and Rafa had to up his game even more. However, Rafa did win, and then he had to play Roger Federer with hardly any time to rest. The commenators were speculating that Roger was watching this game on TV and that he could see that Rafa was exhausted, and Roger probably thought he wouldn't have to play as hard as he has had to do in every match he played against Rafa. But Rafa won the final in 4 sets.

This semi-final match should be offered to the public to buy so that those who did not see the semi final match between these two at the 2009 Australian Open could have a THRILL!!!",1257897600,10,965,4.391061452513966
3907254,5,B002CWKTWI,"I had missed this match on TV, so was thrilled to get my hands on the DVD. Absolutely loved watching it, fabulous match between these 2 greats. Will admit, I was disappointed it wasn't U.S. sportcasters commentating or the usual camera angles, or replays, that ESPN or the Tennis Channel offers with Grand Slams.  Still, what a treat to see this classic match.",1257379200,5,360,4.714285714285714

8364509,5,B002CWKTWI,"For me this game was played with their heart. I would easily put this in one of the best clashes they had in their career. Both played impressive tennis, just like Wimbledon 2007/2008.

Full of crazy and impossible shots, rich in winners and very few unforced errors this one is a clear buy for me. I need to have this one, don't know the future and perhaps youtube is not going to be there lol! I will have to keep and old dvd/blueray player offcourse.

Get a sneak peek in this link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkI4FpZDQcc and roll to 11:00 min. Awesome exchange, a true clash of titans!",1452729600,,593,4.6380952380952385

8364515,5,B002CWKTWI,"This is the Australian broadcast, not featuring the usual suspects of an ESPN or American network broadcast. The commercials have been removed, so the tennis flows smoothly from game to game.

As to the match itself, for many folks (myself included) this is a better match than the Wimbledon classic of 2008 - widely regarded as the best tennis match ever. Wimbledon may have been the best grass court tennis match ever (and best Wimbledon final ever), but the hitting between these two legends is far better on this hard court surface, and I love to watch it more than its Wimbledon companion.

Certainly if you're a fan of the Roger/Rafa rivalry, this match MUST be on your keeper shelf! And if you haven't watched the match with the Australian commentators, you're in for a treat. Not as dry as the BBC commentators, but just as knowledgeable, and as entertaining as a crew of US talkers without the nonstop chatter.",1373673600,,919,4.7375

8364517,5,B002CWKTWI,"If one could watch the SF match with Verdasco from just 40 hours prior, they would realize that this was *so far* the most grueling 11 hours of Nadal's professional career if you combine the total hours on court and the turnaround time between the two matches... less than 2 days *IMO*. Its a monumental task to beat Fed on this surface *during this portion of his career* on any player's best day, even for Rafa, but to do it coming off of less than 48 hours of rest was TITANIC. Rafa proved to his own fans, to the world, to Fed, but more importantly, to HIMSELF, that he was/is worthy of #1. His loss today *MC* killed me, but all streaks must end, as Federer is learning. I just had the pleasure of returning from two weeks at Indian Wells, *another match I will likely buy when available* & I can tell you, if one has yet to attend a match of Rafa's in person, they must. We can FEEL his presence, as he EMOTES raw, unadulterated POWER. His low grunt resonates like a lion's roar resonates your entire being, and seeing him five times on center court, and 4 practices, was just not enough, no matter what. I am fortunate to have seen him play many times in person, but I can still attest that this match, combined with the Verdasco SF, are the two matches that will forever stand out in my mind as the best hard court tennis Rafa has played, *thus far* he is but just 27 *almost* ... although beating Juan Martin last month after a 222 day injury spell was pretty phenomenal. The man isn't unbreakable, but he's certainly close to unstoppable, he will accrue more Masters titles this year. His body is just adjusting to the 'slide'. Rafael Nadal is right up there with Lionel Messi as one of two of the greatest modern athletics & life role models to walk the planet, comporting themselves with pure grace, humility in victory and, more importantly, defeat. Love him or hate him, no one can argue his passion, dedication, and what he has done for the game. VAMOS Rafa and may the best man win next year in Monte Carlo, because he didn't win today. What he did win was the moral victory- always opting for the high ground. Bravo, Sir, Bravo! 8/8 victories in Monte Carlo will stand longer than I will live and is unprecedented. WE ARE ALL PROUD. This Australian Open match is just a brick in the wall that is becoming the monument known as Rafael Nadal.",1366588800,,2357,4.395881006864989
