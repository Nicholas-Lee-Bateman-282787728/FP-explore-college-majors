4105850,1,B003BEDTDC,"Seriously? A freaking box that holds all the seasons together?! If I wanted to buy all the seasons again, I could buy them all individually! If you're going to cancel a show that was FINALLY starting to return to its former glory, atleast give the fans a little something to remember it by! I mean look at the complete series for LOST. They treated their fans with respect, and gave them something more than just a box containing all the seasons. Forget this. Let me know when you decide to do the complete series of Heroes right! Also, when you do, would you mind releasing it on Blu-Ray, and maybe a few extras?

P.S. How about instead of wasting your time and money on that piece of **** Cape show, you put it into giving a good show proper closure...or atleast a proper box set.",1304553600,12,782,4.393103448275862
4105851,4,B003BEDTDC,"I am a gigantic fan of HEROES, but the packaging! It's a paper-thin box surrounding the four season sets, along with a DVD case containing the Season 2 and 3 bonus discs. Sloppy, sloppy work.",1303344000,26,191,4.485714285714286
4105852,5,B003BEDTDC,"Normally I do not like science fiction books or shows, but Heroe's is believable and thought out well.  This is at the top of creative writing.  The actors are amazing and deserve thanks for letting the audience connect with them.  There is very good down to earth humor too which was important to me.  As far as equality between males and females, this show was top notch and did not degrade the males like so many show do these days,  I felt the last two years where just as interesting as the first two, and I was sad to see it end because those writers are so proficient in there work they would have written more captivation storys',  Maybe the show just wanted to end at the top,  I will be watching where these stars work next!!!  I HIGHLY Recommend purchasing of this series and must say I learned a lot from the extra'.
these dvds for the commentaries which are full of whit and explained to those of is who have no clue how filming works.  Ny favorite part is listening to actors speak about how the real actors are vs, what we watch on the show, CONGTATULATIOMSto all who put this show together,  My house burned down I needed some good escapr tv and this show lifted my spirits!",1297814400,16,1190,4.343891402714932
4105853,5,B003BEDTDC,"When taken one season at a time, Heroes can be a little disconcerting, and maybe even a bit confusing.  As someone who had never seen the first season, and then began watching the series, missing a few episodes here and there, I found it fascinating.  Watching Season One gave a sense of order to the rest of the episodes.  While there are an awful lot of characters introduced after Season One, and many who die shortly thereafter (or are they really dead?), the story line which weaves in so many directions at once is intriguing.  Watching the seasons again, in sequence, is awesome and makes me wish for that movie which was supposed to ""wrap things up"".  I don't think the critics have been fair in assessing this series; it seems like there are a lot of fans who'd like to have seen Heroes continue, and who enjoyed the mental challenge of the plot twists and turns, not to mention the twists and turns of the personalities of the characters. I highly recommend this set to anyone who enjoys science fiction - watch it in sequence and to really get the subtleties, try to watch without letting too much time pass between episodes and seasons.  It is a fun series to follow!",1292716800,45,1179,4.537735849056604

4105878,4,B003BEDTDC,"I gave this product 4 stars because of the brittle casing that holds the individual discs.  I received the product the with 4 of the 8 cases cracked with discs loose inside their packaging.  I would have rated it 3 of 5 stars if the discs weren't in the cardboard packaging you see on the product page.  I did purchase this product on a sale price so I feel it is still a good value.  I have the first 4 seasons on DVD also and have not had time to compare the film/audio quality yet but may update my review at a later date.  I you like the series, this is a good value to add to your collection.  The packaging is just not up to par to give it 5 stars.",1482364800,,654,3.9166666666666665

...boxing needed work but still a great gift .",1481587200,,85,4.375
4105881,1,B003BEDTDC,"I bought this set not only because the price was good, but the box seemed so beautiful to have the compete series, However, the disc were truly bad, for example:

1. The "" (DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1)"" didn't play well in my blu-ray, something that never happened before i could hear through only the TV speakers because on my home theater blu-ray it was no use.
2. It never had more than English subtitles and the menu was not easy to navigate, sometimes using the on-screen menu it returned to the beginning of the episode.
3. I never got past disc 5 of the first season, the blu-ray simply expelled it saying that there was no disc.

I considered returning the item, however, the shipping would cost me more than the refund that I would have, so it was a complete waste of money, I wish Amazon retires this product and leave the original box-set, DON't buy it, you'll lose your money and you'll end pissed!",1479168000,,906,4.451807228915663

4105902,5,B003BEDTDC,"am so very excited its coming back for even thirteen shows but would like it to continue.... go cheerleader!!!!!!!!!  I remember almost everything that happened but do need a freshup. when is NBC going to begin the airing of heroes this fall>? I don't want to miss any of them and they haven't done a good job, or any kind of job at all in promoting that heroes will be on the fall lineup at all for NBC this fall at all.. are you absolutely sure they are going to produce and air the thirteen shows, cuz there hasn't been any mention anywhere except here which is the first one I have seen and I know a lot of people from a tv primetime show chat room I belong to which had over forty of us who loved heroes every Monday night we were loyal watchers and not a one of them have heard a word about NBC bring back even for a short time to give it a decent ending. and these  people we have all met onlne from  all over the usa and Canada and am the first and only one to hear anything an that is from you amazon. still no idea when it will be a season opener, my tv chat room who all watched heroes thinks am crazy in the head because they have googled any and all info they could find on heroes coming back even temporary and this seems to not come as being real. even NBC themselves are denying that they will be airing any episodes of heroes even only a few to give it a decent ending for all the viewers who were devoted to the show. so you should probably check your information and correct it. because it only got my hopes extremely up hi, for NBC to let my happiness get smashed, and now am more hurt and let down, cuz I had to get over losing heroes twice now. I was finally over it, thinking about it only occasionally, until you got me all excited and spreading the news to get many others excited, only to get let down once again, and it felt like the first time we lost one of the best shows that NBC actually had a top ten big hit show that could compete with CBS AN CW BLOCKBUSTERS THAT ALWAYS GOT THE SHOWS THAT  LASTED AND KEPT THEIR RATINGS UP SEASONS AFTER SEASONS, NBC FINALLY HAD ONE WITH HEROES THEY JUST DIDNT GIVE IT A BETTER CHANCE AND PUT A MUCH GREATER WRITER TO KEEP THE RATINGS AT THE TOP WHERE THE SHOW COULD HAVE STAYED FOR JUST AS LONG AS CRIMINAL MINDS,SUPERNATURAL AND OTHERS THAT HAVE BEEN ON THE TOP TEN OVER TEN SEASONS, AND MONDAY NIGHT SLOT WAS PERFECT IT DIDNT HAVE ANY BIG COMPETITION TO MAKE IT HARD TO STAY AT THE TOP OF THE RATINGS IF YOU HAD A GOOD WRITER TO KEEP ACTION AND PLOTS THAT LASTED MORE THEN ONE EPISODE TO KEEP YOU COMING BACK FOR MORE AND YOUR ONLY COMPETITON WAS MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL WHEN IT WAS FOOTBALL SEASON SO AM SAD AGAIN CUZ DONT THINK ITS REALLY COMING BACK EVEN TEMPORARY (((NBC))) NEEDS TO LISTEN TO ITS VIEWERS THEIR RATINGS MIGHT INCREASE AND THEY MIGHT BECOME  BACK IN THE SAME LEAGUE AS ((CBS AND CW AMONG A FEW OTHERS)) THERE SO FAR DOWN I DONT EVEN LOOK AT THEIR FALL LINEUPS ANYMORE CUZ I WILL JUST GET INTERESTED AND THEY WILL DROP; THEM AND THAT SUCKS!!!!!!

4105967,5,B003BEDTDC,"Get ready Heroes fans!!! Heroes is coming back to NBC this year for a 13 episode special event. I know some seasons weren't as good as others but the creator Tim Kring did a excellent job. This is the best show I have ever watched. Yes some people might not agree but if you think about it what show in the last 10 years has spawned this many careers? Not even walking dead has done this. Zachary Quinto is Spock in 2 Star trek films, a full season of American horror story as well as the upcoming hitman sequel. Hayden Panettiere has been in several movies that have made it to theaters including scream 4 and is the main character in the show Nashville and boosted the career of Ali Larter who has stared in 2 resident evil films and will be in the next one as well. If heroes did exist they would have issues and conflicts like this show brings out and that's one of the reasons I like this show. Also they don't ware masks or tights lol. I will always be a fan.

The first season is some of the best, most inspiring TV I've seen. It actually made me a better person - to try to be a hero in my own mundane way.

Season two wasn't bad, but was too short due to the unfortunate writer's strike.

But by the start of season three the show was in free-fall. I made it most of the way through episode 3 then gave up. I just didn't care any more. Based on what I've read on the internet the series just got worse after that.

I did very much dislike the high level of visceral violence throughout the series. It's the kind of awful bloody meanness you might see in a horror movie. (I hate horror.) Yuck.",1404950400,3,782,4.158940397350993

Everything right down to the soundtrack was unique about the show...a lot of great cast members reflecting a diversity of people and cultures.  somewhere someone said Lost under one of the season listings...maybe 4...was a better investment I didn't really get the last 2 years at all and think this is 10X better start to finish,1392422400,,537,4.691489361702128

4106016,4,B003BEDTDC,A must buy. I was hoping I would have own this and low and behold I have the entire series.,1376956800,,91,3.6
4106017,4,B003BEDTDC,"I love love love this series. That said I couldn't in good conscience give it 5 stars because there were times when I honestly had to wonder if the writers were on crack. There are several instances where characters disappear off the screen and it is like the writing team (unlike the viewers) completely forgot they existed!  SPOILER ALERT!!!! Example: in season 2 Peter meets and apparently falls in love with Caitlyn (not sure about spelling) but once she is left in that horrible alternate future they accidently land in, he completely forgets about her! No mention of any plan to try to rescue here from what is apparently a very terrible future for mankind! Also, little Molly! One season has two of the main characters feeling fatherly affection and love for her- enough that her well being affects all their major actions- but keep watching and hell if anyone remembers that the orphaned little girl exists.

That being said, I honestly love this series. Season one is probably the strongest in my opinion- probably because it is the first exposure to the characters and their individual stories and keeps building and building. I love that you get to see the reactions of all these different people to their new and baffling powers. I have to say it's the darker characters who hooked me in- Nicky and her crazy alter ego, and Bennett.  We don't see too much of my favorite character in first season but I think he got a strong start once he was finally onscreen- as you can probably guess, it's Sylar. Season two felt like the writers were half-asleep and things sorta meander to a point where I was almost annoyed as I made myself watch each episode (cause I hate not knowing what happens!) but they semi-roused themselves enough to gets things rolling again. I think the story line gets siller and siller but the characters I connected to most also got more development so I was happy enough to see what they would do next in response to nearly unbelievable developments.

The last two episodes had me stuck in front of my screen- I thought they built to an interesting finale... of course the story isn't really finished so I don't know if we can really call it a finale. This show needs a 6th season. Or a movie to let us know what happens immediately after Claire's bullheaded disregard of Bennett's advice. How does the world react over the course of a few months, a year? And what the heck is Sylar's fate!!!

So yeah, if you like powers and unbelievable storylines (but some awesome characters) you should like this show. The quality of writing drifts up and down (sometimes plummets) but overall it is interesting enough to keep you entertained the whole way through and they do manage to pull off some shocking moments.",1374278400,,2739,4.674273858921162
4106018,5,B003BEDTDC,This is a great complete series. It was a gift to my son for his birthday. He has had many hours of enjoyment watching it.,1370390400,,122,3.92
4106019,4,B003BEDTDC,"The only reason I gave this series 4 stars, instead of 5, is that the last season's story line wasn't up to the standards of the previous seasons.  The villan wasn't very evil and the regular villan became kind and found redemption after killing many people for power.  Give me a break!  All of the other seasons were fantastic!  If you like fantasy/sci fi, you'll enjoy this too; great acting, production and special effects. Just think twice about purchasing the last season.",1369094400,,477,4.780487804878049

4106021,4,B003BEDTDC,"WARNING, there will be some spoilers from throughout the series in my review.

Heroes was a show that had a true ensemble cast, which was made up of relatively unknown actors (at least when the series started).  There was no superstar actor that everyone would recognize.  As a result there were always multiple storylines going on, and it was truly a show that you had to watch from the beginning to really understand what was happening.

The first and second seasons were very very good.  The first season was excellent, and like nothing that had been on TV.  You knew from the first episode what the characters were going to try to prevent, but there was no way of knowing how it was going to get there.  Because of the time travel aspect the story came in bits and pieces and sometimes out of order.  They did not reveal too much about each character too soon.  We never got to see Sylar until midway through the season, and HRG's (or as we would come to know him Noah Bennet) past and motivations were kept hidden until almost the end of the first season.

I think the series had a clear goal of where it was going in the first and second seasons.  You could tell that it was meticulously planned out.  However the writer's strike ended the second season midway through, and it had to be cut short.  There were some stories from that season that were just abandoned entirely, and I thought those should have been wrapped up before proceeding how they did.  It felt like after the strike the writers never had a clear plan for the show.  I did not like how the third season made Nathan into a villain.  He had always had a grey moral compass, but it seemed that had gone away at the end of the first season and with the second.  But then he did a complete 180 (almost anyway) then they decided to try to make him likable again by giving the impression that he was just in over his head.

I think the 4th season actually wrapped the series up very well.  While it was not intended to be the end of the show (it was not cancelled until after the season had ended), it tied up everyone's stories, and left a lot to your own imagination.  The reason I think the show declined, is that while the main ""big"" storylines changed every season, the individual stories within that got very repetitive.  They kept too many characters around for too long, and kept the characters going through the same conflicts and experiences over and over.  While this did change somewhat by the 4th season, I think too many people had abandoned the show by then.

I definitely think it is better to see the series all at once.  The stories do tend to flow a little better than when there were months between seasons.  Plus it is just easier to follow with all the time jumps, flash-backs and character arcs. If you were a fan of the show, it is definitely worth adding to your collection.  The series looks great on blu ray, and there are a lot of entertaining extras.",1366675200,3,2947,4.401109057301294
4106022,4,B003BEDTDC,"I enjoyed the majority of this series. My favorite characters were Hero and Ando, though each character was interesting in his/her own right.

4106037,4,B003BEDTDC,Lets start off with the box that the disc set was shipped in the box looks to be very thin cardboard. the dvd disc look to gentle used i Would suggest cleaning the disc in each set before using them but all in all a good series and is worth it at $65 the shipping was free and fast it took two days to get to new york but you will have to make time to watch it i suggest watching it one season at a time do not try to watch it all in one day it will not work if you are a fan of sci-fi i suggest to get it here at amazon because it is cheaper. Ebay want $80 Walmart wants $100 i gave it four out of five because the set was gentle used but the seller said it was new or i look at it  wrong and that it said like new i do not recall. but buy it you will like it,1345075200,,760,3.497041420118343

When i opened it, that excitement only went up! The box art is brilliant! i love that its like a comic! After opening it and examining it further, my smile started to disappear. I already knew that this was just the original 4 seasons in a new box that holds them together, that wasn't my issue. the problem i had/have is that this product looks like it was made in someones basement, it does not look or feel very official. ALL FOUR of my box sets were DAMAGED!!! the worst was my Season 3, which happens to be my FAVORITE! I seriously am starting to believe that the season 3 box, and maybe all of them, are used! You might think that it may have been damaged in transit, but even the the INSIDE of the box is damaged!! i literally had to TAPE one of the discs INTO the box!! I am tempted to buy another, but i don't want the same thing to happen. I may just get a new season 3 box and throw this one out -_- (not really but you get the idea)",1340668800,4,1113,3.9732142857142856

I actually bought this set specifically for the Season 4 bonus disc; since I have the bonus discs for Seasons 1-3.  Both my Blu-ray player AND PS3 spit the DVD back out stating a PAL disc/Region 2 could not be played; the listing and Blu-ray.com show the playback as 'region free'.  This Amazon listing show it as 'region 1', the blu-rays are playable, but apparently NOT the DVD; so this review is towards the product for sale; not the content.",1330732800,6,519,4.559139784946237
