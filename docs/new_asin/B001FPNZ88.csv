I am mot trying to diminish Weinstien's musical ability in any way. But there were serveral instances where he was given the solo and just drowned out the whole band, sounding quite raspy at times, not smooth like an experienced violinist. It would have been much better if they had mixed the violin volume much lower. I liked how the band really enyoyed themselves and displayed their sense of humor, I say there are alot of rock acts out there today that can take a page of out this bands sense of humor. I like how Vignola introduced each of the songs and his band members and with a sense of humor thrown in. So unless you really like the sound of the violin you'd be okay with this. Otherwise you'd be disappointed as the rest of the musicans get a lesser display of their performance in favor of the violin player who in my opinion is just a good amateur and is heavily favored in the sound mix over the other instruments. During the last part, the interview part there is a sound track being played and I can hardly hear the guys taking in their interview.",1295913600,,1237,4.336206896551724
8302264,4,B001FPNZ88,"I've been a big fan of 42-year old guitarist extraordinaire for many years and play his CDs often. Though I've seen him play in person twice, this DVD/CD set lets the rest of the world get to see him do his magic on the strings without ever leaving their house.

Though listed, and advertised, as a DVD, the set includes TWO CDs of the audio portion of this two-hour concert recorded in March 2008 at the Sheldon Concert Hall in St. Louis, MO.

Vignola's group ""Frank Vignola's Rhythm Machine"" consists of four talented musician's supporting the leader. All are younger than Vignola, including 22-year old violinist Aaron Weinstein, who started touring with the group when he was only 16! Percussionist Rich Zukor - who seems to always have a big smile on his face - doesn't carry a set of drums, but he gets some incredible sounds from a djembe drum and using a set of drumsticks on other stringed instruments.

All the musicians are great but when Vignola takes a solo, and his fingers fly across the fret board, you can't believe that anyone can play that fast - and that good!

The variety of music in this concert is wide-ranging - from ""Carmen"" and ""Scheherazade"" (misspelled as Scheherezade on the package) through ""Limehouse Blues"" and on to originals by Vignola. ""Tico Tico"" starts out like the standard it is, but within its 10-minute length it becomes bluegrass, jazz and even a bit Beatlesque.

In addition to the two hour-concert, there is a 22-minute interview with the band members that is mildly interesting.

The camera work is great but I found the images through most of the performance to not be very sharp - almost as though there was Vaseline covering the lens. It's only because of the image quality that I dropped one star from my rating.

Vignola points out in the bonus interview segment that he learned guitar - at age seven - from a Mel Bay instructional video. So things have come full circle. Catch Vignola live if you can, but - in the meantime - this is the next best thing to being there. And, unlike many jazz performance DVDs, with the CDs included you can take the concert ""on the road"".
