5427726,5,B00AIA89OQ,I haven't seen I dream of jeannie movie in a long time so I just had to get it! The picture quality is great and so is the movie!,1360368000,2,129,3.4827586206896552
5427727,5,B00AIA89OQ,"Great version of this film, please release the second movie ""I Still Dream Of Jeannie"" Excellent copy of the movie",1360108800,2,114,4.75
5427728,4,B00AIA89OQ,"After 28 years after it aired, it's great to finally see ""I Dream of Jeannie: 15 Years Later"" on DVD!!! I remember enjoying this made-for-TV movie at the time and, despite Larry Hagman's absence, it is still a joy to see everyone from the original series reunite 15 years later!! This is a must-have for any Jeannie fan !!!",1358985600,,323,4.491525423728813
5427729,2,B00AIA89OQ,"Sony dusts off the first of two ""I Dream of Jeannie"" reunion movies for a MOD DVD-R release and while I love the original series, I can't say this one's worth revisiting. I should have known better since I did watch this when it aired in the fall of 1985 and all these years the only thing I remembered about it was that Jeannie's evil sister was always sporting a short spikey hairdo like Susan Clark in ""Webster"".

At the time, Larry Hagman was busy with ""Dallas"" so the role of Tony Nelson went to poor Wayne Rogers (""M*A*S*H*) who has all the screen presence of a turnip here and zero chemistry with Barbara Eden. The plot has Tony about to retire from duty but when he agrees to go on another mission, Jeannie becomes furious and the two separate, she taking their pre-teen son Tony Jr. (MacKenzie Astin) with her. Her wicked sister figures largely into the plot as she constantly uses her powers to keep the two from reconciling. The most interesting thing about this travesty is seeing what ridiculous get-up Jeannie II will show up in next. **NOTE** Check the screen grabs in the Images section of this product to see all of them.

When Jeannie is interviewed for ""Genie's Home Journal"" (the reporter is played by Dody Goodman), we are treated to clips from the original TV series. Also, the movie re-creates the famous opening scene from the pilot episode where Tony frees Jeannie from her bottle on the beach and she gratefully throws her arms around him rewarding him with a kiss. These things only make one want to turn this off and go back and watch the original. William Asher directed this and it should be noted that many of the stale sight gags are stolen directly from ""Bewitched"": the suitcase packing itself, levitating teapot, the party guests frozen in time and Jeannie II sitting on a lampshade.

The familiar theme song morphs into a cheesy '80s synth version to stay ""current and hip"", but now seems more dated than the original. Haji has now become a flamboyant African-American gym bunny who runs a health club/aerobics studio in the movie's effort to stay oh-so-relevant to the mid-'80s.

Only diehard fans of Barbara Eden should get this. It's a terrible, dull movie. If you want to see Barbara in something much more fun and entertaining, check out her 1974 thriller ""The Stranger Within"" instead.

The video quality is terrific on the disc and it did play in my PC, but there are no subtitles or extras.

TWO STARS. Proceed at your own risk.",1358035200,62,2472,4.632420091324201
5427730,5,B00AIA89OQ,"I had watched this movie often as a kid and have looked for it numerous places.  Finally found it after doing a search for Barbara Eden.  The movie, as I remember it, is just like the description-Jeannie is married with a son and Colonel Anthony is close to retirement (I think).  He decides to do one last mission against Jeannie's wishes and the mission ends up endangering his life.  In the meantime, Jeannie decides to separate from him for awhile and doesn't realize that her sister is swooping in to cause problems.  Jeannie only has moments to find a way out her predicament, and help her husband.  Can she do it?  ;)  It's a good movie that I have fondly remembered for many years.  It doesn't star Larry Hagman, that is true, but Wayne Rogers (who also starred in M*A*S*H)does a fine job.  I plan to order it so I can relive some childhood memories.",1357430400,39,858,4.47741935483871

I wish this DVD had the PROMO commercials shown at the time it was aired...insinuating and accusing Jeannie for many of the worlds screw ups, etc,....like Watergate.  Sadly, NO extras are included with this DVD.  A commentary by Director William Asher, husband and director of Elizabeth Montgomery/Bewitched would have been GREAT as an extra (Alas, now deceased a couple of years ago) since both Bewitched & Jeannie were both filmed on the same Burbank Ranch lot....(as the houses are on the same street).

5427915,2,B00AIA89OQ,I grew up with I dream of Jeannie.  I liked the premise of the movie but it was just a little off.  When you grow up watching the show you get used to the sound effects etc.  They changed all of them and they were really bad compared to the original series.  I was disappointed that they did that.  It was bad enough that Larry Hagman did not reprise his role as Tony but they changed a few to many things for my taste.,1394668800,22,419,3.9404761904761907

5427918,2,B00AIA89OQ,"The first thing you need to know, in case you missed the fine print: this is a manufactured-on-demand DVD. Even if a seller uses words like ""official"" or ""authentic"" you will still get a DVD that was burned on a computer with a lightscribe disk label and cover art that was printed on a 1997 bubble jet personal printer. The quality of the playback is fine. There are no special features or DVD menus (it just plays). For nearly $20, I'd say you really have to want this movie.

With that said, DO you really want this movie? I remember enjoying it as a kid. Watching it now at 37, what was I thinking? It's not a great movie! The acting is horrible. The story is dumb, and pretty much a total downer for anyone who loved the original series. Tony was played by Wayne Rogers, who bastardized the role. The pink genie outfit was ugly and looked nothing like the original. The magic blink sound was changed to an awkward Tinkerbell chime. TJ was a total dweeb. Dr. Bellows didn't interact with anyone (he wasn't much more than a cameo). And the whole, ""I can't steer the space shuttle"" thing was just ridiculous.

If you think you want to buy this one, I'd suggest watching it on YouTube first. You might change your mind.

Barbara Eden is still amazing beautiful. The one thing I didn't like is they changed the Major Nelson Character and that was hard to get used to.

5427995,4,B00AIA89OQ,Missing a star because it doesn't have Larry Hagman in it (he was busy with Dallas in 1985). After reselling this on ebay the buyer swears it is a fake bootleg due to it being a dvd-r and the rest having a printed-at-home look. Luckily I never cared for the pretty box or whether the dvd was pressed or burned and most others don't either. With older movies like this there's no profit in having 50k discs pressed/packed/stored/shipped and then waiting for them to sell (quite possibly never selling them all). If it wasn't for dvd-r and burn-on-demand movies like this would simply be unbuyable (other than getting lucky with some pirate at a flea market) and you'd have to rely on poor-quality torrents or Youtube.,1383955200,,716,4.690476190476191

5427999,4,B00AIA89OQ,"When I DREAM OF JEANNIE went off the air in 1970, we were never really given a conclusion to the series: the intended finale plotline was altered, saying that Tony had a nightmare in which Dr. Bellows witnesses Jeannie's magic and the Nelsons must start a new life elsewhere; this was altered just in case the last 3 episodes aired out of order.
In 1985, just weeks after the would-be finale aired 15 years earlier, NBC aired its made-for-television movie, I DREAM OF JEANNIE...15 YEARS LATER, which more-or-less picked up where the series ended: Tony and Jeannie have indeed relocated (out of work necessity, not because of her powers being exposed)to Houston, and have a teenaged son, Tony, Junior (aka TJ), and are still happily married - TJ even comments later on that he is the only kid in his whole grade whose birth parents are still married.
But not all is as well as it seems with the Nelsons' marriage, especially when Tony (who, along with Roger Healey, has become colonel over the past decade and a half) announces that he will be serving on one more mission into space, even though he is retiring from the Air Force and from NASA. This argument turns into a full -fledged fight, and Jeannie moves out with their son and is determined to become a more modern woman (which includes getting a job and being independent), while Tony prepares for (and eventually goes on) his final mission. In the meantime, Jeannie's secret is revealed to TJ, and her devious sister Jeannie II returns to create the usual havoc and chaos -this time, with the help of Haji, leader of the genies, who owns a women's fitness club in Houston - in the hopes that her sister's marriage will crumble and fall apart for good.
While Larry Hagman does not reprise his role of Anthony Nelson for this movie (he was under contract to CBS and immensely busy with the success of his series DALLAS, though there are stories saying other things were involved in his decision as well), M*A*S*H alumni Wayne Rodgers steps in to portray everyone's favorite astronaut, with Bill Daily, Hayden Rorke, and Barbara Eden reprising their memorable roles from the classic sitcom, and child actor MacKenzie Astin as Tony and Jeannie's son TJ. The chemistry between Rodgers and Eden is lacking, but the story is a very well written and conceived and seamlessly works with the material from the original series.

8552118,5,B00AIA89OQ,"Love this movie even though Larry Hagman is missing and even though William Asher, of Bewitched fame, directed it. Maybe that's why it's got a Samantha vibe to it. Jeannie's all of a sudden going to live the mortal life! A fun idea for the comedy of it, but so not her style. She, unlike Samantha, reveled in her powers and I don't think she would have wanted to be without them. Love evil Jeannie, but can't believe the good one still falls for her pranks.",1529020800,,457,4.325581395348837

8552123,4,B00AIA89OQ,"I give only 4 stars because I missed one very important thing that made me love I Dream Of Jeannie: The great chemistry between Jeannie and Tony.  Without Larry Hagmann as Colonel Nelson it is just not the same.  Wayne Rogers does a very good job as Tony Nelson and maybe it is just me, but ...  Barbara Eden is great as always as Jeannie and her evil sister and therefore, the ""reunion movie"" is absolutely worth watching for any Jeannie and Barbara Eden fan. I thought it was bit of a shame that Hayden Rorke as Dr. Bellows had only two brief appearances.  His character had so much more potential.",1501891200,,600,4.378378378378378

8552125,3,B00AIA89OQ,"Amazon again were great with delivery to such a distance, but I was somewhat disappointed in the story line.  Great to see Barbara Eden again who appeared to have changed very little, and Bill Daily.  Wasn't really impressed with their chose of portrayal of Major Tony Nelson.",1491436800,,276,4.851063829787234
