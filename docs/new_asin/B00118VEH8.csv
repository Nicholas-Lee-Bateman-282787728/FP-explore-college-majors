Barnaby retires!  All os these episodes are good but worth the
price alone is the one: Midsomer Rhapsody. The music by Jim

3063382,5,B00118VEH8,"My English husband and I lived in England from 1990 to 1998 and retired to England.  When we discovered the Midsomer Murders series we were delighted to recognize some of the scenery of our favorite places in Merry Olde. Henley on Thames (the scene of the famous Henley Regatta) was featured in a past episode, and right at the beginning of the episode called ""Last Year's Model"" was a glimpse of the town hall and some shops of Henley on Thames.  John Nettles shines in the fine tradition of English understated acting, and the scripts are well crafted.  Direction of each series is shared by a few experts led by Brian True May and the end result is one that can be viewed by the entire family without embarassment.  Our only regret is that the U.S. cable station broadcasting in our Florida area dropped the show.  Bad decision.  We hope they reconsider.  The release of these shows on DVD is too slow for our taste.",1206144000,11,919,4.533333333333333
3063383,5,B00118VEH8,"My wife, mother, and I followed these when they aired on a couple cable networks. We were all sorely disappointed when they did not continue to air them. I had already bought several sets on DVD for my mother when they ceased televising them. I am just very happy they are putting all the sets on DVD. I just ordered sets 9 and 10 for my mom's birthday. I do wish they put them in seasons rather than sets, because you end up buying sets that you aren't sure what season they were. All the sets are available in the UK, but haven't been released as Region 1 in the US. If you enjoy detective series, this is one of the best out there. I am a fan of police shows, and the change to the British countryside and culture has a nice feel to it. The stories, acting, directing, sets, and scenery are great. Each set contains four mysteries. I highly recommend this series. The DVD quality is first class and they have excellent replayability. The set is the slim case type. - C. Luster",1204070400,57,979,4.268817204301075
3063384,5,B00118VEH8,"Consistently well-written, filmed, acted, and produced, this series is a constant delight to those of who want mysteries with snappy dialogue, beautiful scenery, and the chance to try to solve the mystery before the police. They manage (somehow)  to tell a story without a great deal of swearing, gore, or unecessary violence. Thank goodness the BBC keeps issuing them for purchase since we have little here in the States other than reality shows to watch. When the Biography Channel in its infinite wisdom (not!) decided to cease running this show I dashed off a letter of protest.

John Nettles is a delight in the main character of Barnaby, walking a fine line of police authority with charm and humor that show his acting ability is top notch. His wife and daughter in the series are always incorporated into the mysteries in ways that make perfect sense, and his sidekicks (all 3 that have been in the series) are well written and possess different strengths and weaknesses that keep the viewer rooting for them in their dealings with Barnaby. What really shines is the ability of so many different writers maintaining such a high level of consistency.

For those of you who enjoy STORY and CHARACTERS along with a good plot rather than predictable science or gore, this series is for you. This particular collection has an outstanding variety of mysteries that will give anyone a good sense of the doings in Midsomer. I can't wait until March when it comes out. Each show runs approximately an hour and a half. Please BBC keep them coming!! If you release them, I promise we will BUY!!",1203811200,29,1591,4.799270072992701

3063432,5,B00118VEH8,Midsomers murder is the absolutely best TV show. I really enjoy the britich humor and love to hear all the different ways that the british say everyday things in a different way. It is refreshing to have a really person as the main character who loves his family and friends. Who cares about finding the truth and uses all his senses to discover this truth. I wish that it was on american TV so it is through these wonderful videos that I get a chance to see all of DCI Tom Barnaby solve all these really quircky murders.,1295049600,,521,4.326530612244898
3063433,5,B00118VEH8,I cannot give this series of mysteries a high enough rating.  John Nettles as Chief Inspector Barnaby continues to be highly intelligent and down to earth while endowed with an almost superhuman ability to get to the heart of people's deepest secrets.  He also instructs his subordinate without being insulting.  I wish this series had no end.,1291680000,,343,4.982456140350878
3063444,5,B00118VEH8,"I love the Midsomer Murders series.  I have long thought that British mysteries were better written than American ones because the form is more respected there. This series helps continue that opinion.

These are entertaining without being gruesome.  The acting is first rate. I love the fact that Barnaby clearly loves his wife and family which shows the softer, personal side of him.

If you are looking for a pleasurable way to spend some evenings, I suggest purchasing the videos, starting at Set 1.  However, each story is a story unto itself, so you can purchase them out of order and still enjoy them.",1289865600,,608,4.8076923076923075
3063445,5,B00118VEH8,"I have been watching British programs on and off for as long as I can remember. I appreciate the sarcastic and cynical sense of humor that combines modesty and morality with a twist of vulgarism and acceptance of human variances. Midsomer is compared here in the US with Law and Order but I would compare it to Columbo. My family and I have enjoyed many, many evenings of untangling the twisted plots and relationships that make it such an enjoyable series and get a great kick out of identifying recurring minor characters and settings throughout the villages. We have all decided there can be no more dangerous place in the world to live than 'the bucolic villages' of Midsomer County. Series Ten has been our absolute favorite so far.",1284854400,,737,4.72093023255814
3063446,5,B00118VEH8,"I enjoyed renting this series so much that I am now purchasing all episodes.  I am sorry to hear that John Nettles will be retiring in August as I think this series could go on and on...with him....for many more years.  I love the English countryside, and the manner in which the murders are handled.  Also, I can understand every word each actor says, which is more than I can say about a lot of other English movies, videos, TV series.  This is one of the best series I've come across since receiving my first TV set in 1949!",1278633600,,527,4.292929292929293

I absolutely LOVE the twists and turns that the Midsomer Murders stories come up with.  I'm just surprised there is anyone still alive in some of those villages..
Seems to be an awful lot of ""love affairs"" and ""sticky situations"" between the villagers and then at least 2 or 3 or sometimes more end up murdered...
Great stories, though !!!!

It's an original, cleverly depicted tale that had me captivated at scene one.  I have been disappointed with the latest MM DVDs I have purchased (Sets 13 and 14 in particular).  It appears the writers are changing their format or maybe Barnaby is just ready to retire.  The episodes seem to have lost their usual vigor and I have been able to identify the miscreant way before the end of the show.",1270684800,,574,4.543689320388349

3063450,5,B00118VEH8,"The majority of this product was outstanding.

3063451,5,B00118VEH8,"Nobody can do detective or ghost stories like the British!
These series are great! No extreme graphic violence & great work in every possible way.
The characters are always likeable. Though I must say ""Troy"" was my favorite!

The sights in these series are breathtaking!
England is so beautiful.
And if you like Victorian houses , estates, or castles these series have plenty of the most beautiful in the world.
That's another thing nobody can build houses like the British . Absolutely beautiful works of art!

As a British fan I recommend these series. Each & every single one of these series is absolutely perfectly done.",1266883200,,624,4.877358490566038
3063452,5,B00118VEH8,I have come to love this series.  It is like CSI British style.  I love how Chef Inspector Barnaby thinks and how he brings his partners along with him.  Great Series.,1264550400,,167,4.32258064516129
3063453,4,B00118VEH8,"I'm a great fan of this series and own almost all of the DVDs.  But set 10 contains one of the worst clunkers I've ever suffered through: Second Sight.  We are asked to believe that an Anglican minister committed three murders in order to baptize a single child, thereby sending a message to the local bishop that the clergyman was effective as an evangelist!! Look for the ""menacing"" shots of a font and a prayer book; such evil.

I'm used to seeing Anglican and Catholic clergy being attacked by the British (see, for example, ""A Near Death Experience"" in A Touch of Frost, year 12); England is a secular and materialistic culture. But this is going way way over the edge into gaga land.  It's a serious flaw in an otherwise entertaining and consistently well made series.",1261267200,,774,4.627737226277373

3063465,5,B00118VEH8,"In the fictional county of Midsomer, murder rates per capita are higher than Chicago, Detroit, and New Orleans combined - but not by much!

The pluses for this series are: this is fiction, the scenery is much better, there is a lot of tongue-in-cheek British humor, and John Nettles is an excellent actor and humorist. Jane Wymark, as Barnaby's wife, also does a great job along with Laura Howard and Jason Hughes.

If you like multiple who-dun-its woven within one story, this series is for you.",1259712000,2,496,4.755813953488372
3063466,5,B00118VEH8,"MIDSUMER MURDERS remains a compelling series even though Troy is no longer a part of the cast.  Troy's replacement leaves quite a lot to be desired but he was soon replaced with a far more interesting partner for Barnaby.  One of the best things about this series is that Barnaby doesn't have to put up with a lot of nonsense from a superior officer.  This has become such a trite and tiresome gimmick in so many other detective series.  Barnaby is always charming, witty, and personable as is his devoted wife.  The daughter's a bit of a drag and certainly lacks her parents' charisma but she's serviceable.  I've seen many different detective series from Britain and America, and this is among the very best.",1253318400,,710,4.685483870967742
3063467,5,B00118VEH8,"This show continues in the fine English traditions of whodunits.

Not as cerebral as Morse, set in a fictional area as opposed to a specific one to utilise much of the beautiful countryside locations, yet drawing on the same pool of British actors across the years, Midsomer Muders is like the pudding which serves as desert for the evening meal - outwardly bland but with a scrumptious plesant and satisfying interior.

These stories are replete with visions of warm beer and simpler times, a vision conjured up for tourists but which many Brits believe in. Throughout the show there have been considerable variations in the quality of the productions from some quite mediocre to a few excellent ones.

This set has an outstanding story of avarice and revenge with excellent acting but the other stories are more like shadows of episodes of Inspector Morse where the similarities, though disguised, are too great to ignore.

However, the one story makes buying the whole set so worthwhile.

So enjoy your roast beef and two veg, and dig into the sponge pudding with custard and savour the long sunny days of an English summer, as the cricket dominates the television until the last over is played.",1247184000,,1198,4.8817733990147785
3063468,5,B00118VEH8,"""Midsomer Murders Set Ten""is a boxed, 4 volume set of four contemporary, stand-alone British mysteries, each approximately 100 minutes long, from a popular British TV hit.  The television series first aired in the United Kingdom in March, 1997.  In the United States, the series has been seen on ""A & E"" and ""The Biography Channel."" New episodes are still in production (more than 60 full-length mysteries have already aired.)  The characters are based on those created by Caroline Graham; the series was originally adapted by acclaimed scriptwriter Anthony Horowitz (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Foyle-s-War-Series-1-5-From-Dunkirk-to-VE-Day/dp/B0024OW1QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Foyle's War: Series 1-5 - From Dunkirk to VE-Day</a>.) Special features include a Graham biography and cast filmographies, but, unfortunately, no subtitles, as all the characters speak rather softly, and John Nettles, the series' star, tends to swallow his words.  However, you should be able to follow the action well enough without the subtitles.

The series is set in the fictional, lovely, countryside village of Midsomer; and it certainly is green, quaint, and scenic.  It's a classic ""cozy"" setting; lovely village, denizens upset by a murder, villain found; everything back to normal again.  It stars John Nettles (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BERGERAC/dp/B001VWMY9Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BERGERAC </a>); as Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby, hard-working family man and astute detective, and John Hopkins (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-in-a-Cold-Climate/dp/B000A6T1W2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love in a Cold Climate</a>) as his assistant Sergeant Dan Scott.  The series also features many esteemed guest stars, including Annette Crosbie, Oliver Ford Davies, Owen Teale, June Whitfield, Geoffrey Whitehead, and David Burke.  Unfortunately, I still find Nettles' character Barnaby to be rather the hole in the donut, nor does Hopkins' character Scott add much flavor. But the supporting players all bring a lot of spice to the screen, and the makers haven't stinted in the making of this series.  Plenty of extras, animal and human, lots of local color.  And these four mysteries are particularly strong.  They are:

1. Second Sight.  Villagers in Midsomer Mere claim psychic powers; a mysterious death brings Barnaby and Scott into their midst.
2. Hidden Depths.  A series of bizarre murders; Chateau Laffite wine used as an extremely expensive murder weapon.
3. Sauce for the Goose.  A visitor dies an unappetizing death while touring Plummer's relish factory.
4. Midsomer Rhapsody.  Successful local composer Joan Alder has been dead for decades, is half-forgotten, until a series of odd events revives interest in her life and work.

This TV series is really quite enjoyable; the mysteries are challenging, interesting, many-layered, off-beat.  And original - you won't see anything like them anywhere else.",1245974400,,3039,6.210023866348449

Here are four well done British mysteries with the unflappable DCI Barnaby and the long suffering Sgt. Scott. As always there is the right mixture of humor along with the ghastly murders to keep us from taking this too seriously. This is one of the better mysteries and is up there with Inspector Lynley, Foyle's War and others. John Nettles is absolutely great as is the very talented supporting cast. The ""Midsomer"" countryside is lovely and calls to us for a visit if we are ever in merry old England. It is a very well done and entertaining show.

3063493,4,B00118VEH8,"This droll series just gets better and better.  Beware, because it can become an addiction!

I've come to appreciate Inspector Barnaby's (John Nettles) mature and calm presence and the sometimes conflicting cocksure brash attitude of his assistant Scott (John Hopkins).  I still miss Troy (Daniel Casey) but the killings in the deceptively lush stately settings have not let up -- thank goodness.

I guess the thing that holds my attention is the juxtaposition of the madness being investigated with the patient tolerance Barnaby has for his family and private life.  Sometimes the humor is dark.  It's the ordinariness of a middle-class life up against the gruesome murders and bloodletting that makes it relatable.  Barnaby copes and brings us closure.  And that is very reassuring.

These four fine episodes (see product description) seem to be culled from the fuller and lengthier season as broadcast in the UK. I wonder if that is just a marketing ploy for US sales?  In any event, this great old-fashioned whudunit set delivers cozy English village murder mysteries at the highest level.  I especially relished the delicious ""Sauce For The Goose"" episode.  A tasty treat indeed.

If you are new to the series.  By all means take a look at the now available first 18 titles in a special set.

I don't know where the series is shot, but I have spent time in Buckinghamshire and it strikes me as similar to the fictional Midsomer environs.  I don't mean to disparage the denizens, but there is a lurking inbred madness just beyond the finely manicured landscape that is inescapable to the observant eye.  And ""Midsomer Murders"" perfectly captures the ambience of the middle-class innocent and guilty in an evocative and colorfully accurate manner.  The eccentric battiness of the likely suspects -- and sometimes victims -- is what makes this show timeless.

Actor John nettles is a staid presence of sanity amidst the madness.  He and the series are superb.

Highly recommended.",1207872000,10,1982,5.036923076923077

When we discovered the Midsomer Murders series we were delighted to recognize some of the scenery of our favorite places in Merry Olde. Henley on Thames (the scene of the famous Henley Regatta) was featured in a past episode, and right at the beginning of the episode called ""Last Year's Model"" was a glimpse of the town hall and some shops of Henley on Thames.  John Nettles shines in the fine tradition of English understated acting, and the scripts are well crafted.  Direction of each series is shared by a few experts led by Brian True May and the end result is one that can be viewed by the entire family without embarassment.  Our only regret is that the U.S. cable station broadcasting in our Florida area dropped the show.  Bad decision.  We hope they reconsider.

I had already bought several sets on DVD for my mother when they ceased televising them. I am just very happy they are putting all the sets on DVD. I just ordered sets 9 and 10 for my mom's birthday. I do wish they put them in seasons rather than sets, because you end up buying sets that you aren't sure what season they were. All the sets are available in the UK, but haven't been released as Region 1 in the US. If you enjoy detective series, this is one of the best out there. I am a fan of police shows, and the change to the British countryside and culture has a nice feel to it. The stories, acting, directing, sets, and scenery are great. Each set contains four mysteries. I highly recommend this series. The DVD quality is first class and they have excellent replayability. The set is the slim case type. - C. Luster",1204070400,57,979,4.268817204301075
3297881,5,B00118VEH8,"Consistently well-written, filmed, acted, and produced, this series is a constant delight to those of who want mysteries with snappy dialogue, beautiful scenery, and the chance to try to solve the mystery before the police. They manage (somehow)  to tell a story without a great deal of swearing, gore, or unecessary violence. Thank goodness the BBC keeps issuing them for purchase since we have little here in the States other than reality shows to watch. When the Biography Channel in its infinite wisdom (not!) decided to cease running this show I dashed off a letter of protest.

John Nettles is a delight in the main character of Barnaby, walking a fine line of police authority with charm and humor that show his acting ability is top notch. His wife and daughter in the series are always incorporated into the mysteries in ways that make perfect sense, and his sidekicks (all 3 that have been in the series) are well written and possess different strengths and weaknesses that keep the viewer rooting for them in their dealings with Barnaby. What really shines is the ability of so many different writers maintaining such a high level of consistency.

For those of you who enjoy STORY and CHARACTERS along with a good plot rather than predictable science or gore, this series is for you. This particular collection has an outstanding variety of mysteries that will give anyone a good sense of the doings in Midsomer. I can't wait until March when it comes out.

Look for the ""menacing"" shots of a font and a prayer book; such evil.

I'm used to seeing Anglican and Catholic clergy being attacked by the British (see, for example, ""A Near Death Experience"" in A Touch of Frost, year 12); England is a secular and materialistic culture.

One of the best things about this series is that Barnaby doesn't have to put up with a lot of nonsense from a superior officer.

Not as cerebral as Morse, set in a fictional area as opposed to a specific one to utilise much of the beautiful countryside locations, yet drawing on the same pool of British actors across the years, Midsomer Muders is like the pudding which serves as desert for the evening meal - outwardly bland but with a scrumptious plesant and satisfying interior.

These stories are replete with visions of warm beer and simpler times, a vision conjured up for tourists but which many Brits believe in. Throughout the show there have been considerable variations in the quality of the productions from some quite mediocre to a few excellent ones.

This set has an outstanding story of avarice and revenge with excellent acting but the other stories are more like shadows of episodes of Inspector Morse where the similarities, though disguised, are too great to ignore.

However, the one story makes buying the whole set so worthwhile.

3297965,5,B00118VEH8,"""Midsomer Murders Set Ten""is a boxed, 4 volume set of four contemporary, stand-alone British mysteries, each approximately 100 minutes long, from a popular British TV hit.  The television series first aired in the United Kingdom in March, 1997.  In the United States, the series has been seen on ""A & E"" and ""The Biography Channel."" New episodes are still in production (more than 60 full-length mysteries have already aired.)  The characters are based on those created by Caroline Graham; the series was originally adapted by acclaimed scriptwriter Anthony Horowitz (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Foyle-s-War-Series-1-5-From-Dunkirk-to-VE-Day/dp/B0024OW1QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Foyle's War: Series 1-5 - From Dunkirk to VE-Day</a>.) Special features include a Graham biography and cast filmographies, but, unfortunately, no subtitles, as all the characters speak rather softly, and John Nettles, the series' star, tends to swallow his words.  However, you should be able to follow the action well enough without the subtitles.

The series is set in the fictional, lovely, countryside village of Midsomer; and it certainly is green, quaint, and scenic.  It's a classic ""cozy"" setting; lovely village, denizens upset by a murder, villain found; everything back to normal again.  It stars John Nettles (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BERGERAC/dp/B001VWMY9Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BERGERAC </a>); as Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby, hard-working family man and astute detective, and John Hopkins (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-in-a-Cold-Climate/dp/B000A6T1W2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love in a Cold Climate</a>) as his assistant Sergeant Dan Scott.  The series also features many esteemed guest stars, including Annette Crosbie, Oliver Ford Davies, Owen Teale, June Whitfield, Geoffrey Whitehead, and David Burke.  Unfortunately, I still find Nettles' character Barnaby to be rather the hole in the donut, nor does Hopkins' character Scott add much flavor. But the supporting players all bring a lot of spice to the screen, and the makers haven't stinted in the making of this series.  Plenty of extras, animal and human, lots of local color.  And these four mysteries are particularly strong.  They are:

1. Second Sight.  Villagers in Midsomer Mere claim psychic powers; a mysterious death brings Barnaby and Scott into their midst.
2. Hidden Depths.  A series of bizarre murders; Chateau Laffite wine used as an extremely expensive murder weapon.
3. Sauce for the Goose.  A visitor dies an unappetizing death while touring Plummer's relish factory.
4. Midsomer Rhapsody.  Successful local composer Joan Alder has been dead for decades, is half-forgotten, until a series of odd events revives interest in her life and work.

This TV series is really quite enjoyable; the mysteries are challenging, interesting, many-layered, off-beat.  And original - you won't see anything like them anywhere else.",1245974400,,3039,6.210023866348449

3297969,5,B00118VEH8,"I think I have seen nearly all the Midsomer shows and they just get better and better. Here are four well done British mysteries with the unflappable DCI Barnaby and the long suffering Sgt. Scott. As always there is the right mixture of humor along with the ghastly murders to keep us from taking this too seriously. This is one of the better mysteries and is up there with Inspector Lynley, Foyle's War and others. John Nettles is absolutely great as is the very talented supporting cast. The ""Midsomer"" countryside is lovely and calls to us for a visit if we are ever in merry old England. It is a very well done and entertaining show.

I'm not sure if they are released differently in the USA but in Australia this DVD set is DEFINATELY not Season 10.

3297990,4,B00118VEH8,"This droll series just gets better and better.  Beware, because it can become an addiction!

I've come to appreciate Inspector Barnaby's (John Nettles) mature and calm presence and the sometimes conflicting cocksure brash attitude of his assistant Scott (John Hopkins).  I still miss Troy (Daniel Casey) but the killings in the deceptively lush stately settings have not let up -- thank goodness.

I guess the thing that holds my attention is the juxtaposition of the madness being investigated with the patient tolerance Barnaby has for his family and private life.  Sometimes the humor is dark.  It's the ordinariness of a middle-class life up against the gruesome murders and bloodletting that makes it relatable.  Barnaby copes and brings us closure.  And that is very reassuring.

These four fine episodes (see product description) seem to be culled from the fuller and lengthier season as broadcast in the UK. I wonder if that is just a marketing ploy for US sales?  In any event, this great old-fashioned whudunit set delivers cozy English village murder mysteries at the highest level.  I especially relished the delicious ""Sauce For The Goose"" episode.  A tasty treat indeed.

If you are new to the series.  By all means take a look at the now available first 18 titles in a special set.

I don't know where the series is shot, but I have spent time in Buckinghamshire and it strikes me as similar to the fictional Midsomer environs.  I don't mean to disparage the denizens, but there is a lurking inbred madness just beyond the finely manicured landscape that is inescapable to the observant eye.  And ""Midsomer Murders"" perfectly captures the ambience of the middle-class innocent and guilty in an evocative and colorfully accurate manner.  The eccentric battiness of the likely suspects -- and sometimes victims -- is what makes this show timeless.

Actor John nettles is a staid presence of sanity amidst the madness.  He and the series are superb.

Highly recommended.",1207872000,10,1982,5.036923076923077
