7792031,4,0792241312,"Though it is obviously a low-budget affair, this video is ideal for any child with an interest in Volcanic activity. They cover various aspects of eruptions, lava types and show wonderful archival footage of volcanic action. If you have a child that is in to volcanoes, this is a must-have item for his or her continuing education.",1241049600,3,331,4.824561403508772
7792032,5,0792241312,"My 4yo loves this video.  He asks for it all the time and tells strangers at the grocery store about subduction volcanos versus the free-flowing lava kind, and about the layers of the earth. Adults who you enjoy sci-fi will catch the goofy in-jokes.",1011052800,2,249,4.659090909090909
