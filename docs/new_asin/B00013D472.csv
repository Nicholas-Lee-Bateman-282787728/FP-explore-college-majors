1969865,5,B00013D472,I was pleasantly surprised at the different turn of events that occurred in this show. I really enjoyed the fact that you really could not guess what was going to happen next. It delves into the Haitian culture a little which was interesting. Definitely worth watching.,1427414400,,269,4.869565217391305

1969869,3,B00013D472,"This movie was good.but not great.  I had a hard following the story line.
The actors were great with the. Script the hard to with.",1410134400,,131,4.24
1969870,2,B00013D472,ok the acting in the film was a bit cheesy the main character is well known actor now so he made the movie otherwise i pass,1408320000,,123,3.769230769230769
1969871,4,B00013D472,"Excellent movie and good acting.  Giancarlo Esposito is one of my favorite actors and excels at his trade.  If it wasn't for the fact that the story took place in approx. four different settings it would have done well in a stage play.  It was a hard hitting drama that basically focused on injustice.  I rated it four instead of five, because in a few spots the sound was messed up.  However, the sound was o.k. 90% of the time.",1404604800,,429,4.3125
1969872,3,B00013D472,"Ok, a little boring.",1404518400,,20,4.25
1969873,1,B00013D472,It starts off with to much bad language for me. It lets me know I'm in for a cursing bad time.,1389312000,3,94,3.5238095238095237
1969883,4,B00013D472,"This movie starts off very slow , but I really enjoyed the movie. I do wish it had a better ending that's why I only gave it 4 stars. I would watch it again.",1388620800,,157,3.6470588235294117
1969884,5,B00013D472,"I choose this rating because of  stars & how well they played their part. excellent,  I love a good movie",1388102400,,105,4.2
1969885,3,B00013D472,I thought that the Haitian voodoo would play a significant part in this movie.  This movie had to have been released in the late nineties so the movie could have been a huge success if they would have combined the twist with more Haitian voodoo.  But instead they stuck to good old jealousy for the climax.  The movies does however get kudos from me by prison abuse being its primary scheme.,1383091200,,391,4.47887323943662
1969886,5,B00013D472,This move is simply wonderful.it kept me glued to the screen.i really like how they kept thier caracters real and lively,1380412800,,120,4.761904761904762

1969888,3,B00013D472,It wasn't too bad. Being Haitian to me it could have been better. Makes you think though. I would watch it again.,1364256000,,113,4.181818181818182
1969889,3,B00013D472,The concept of the story drags out the plot too long confusing the issues. Did not like thus movie at all.,1362441600,,106,4.095238095238095
1969890,5,B00013D472,I have always liked Giancarlo Esposito. I think his career should have been bigger. He proves his worth in this movie.,1361318400,6,118,4.666666666666667
1969891,5,B00013D472,"What faith you  must have in others only to doubt your own self and judgement you make regarding others. This was a good movie and it goes to show, listen to your voice and truly think before you act!!!",1354147200,6,202,4.17948717948718
1969892,5,B00013D472,"Seeing The Keeper caused me to retrospect back to the movie
''Against the Walls''based on the story of Attica 71'. This movie has major significance to what prisoners (innocent or not)
has to endure day-to-day! ''You can't be a Tyrant & a bully and not expect for the tables to turn on you & those like you''!
This movie is about Ethinicity,Good-Evil,Love-Hate and Bonds that are broken due to jealousy. It tells people of any creed or color to embrace & be Proud of who & what you are. Remain Humble don't let others steer you wrong! Don't make assumptions of others because you don't walk in their shoes (it's much deeper than what's on the surface). The same jail that Lamont (Esposito) put prisoners in was the same in which he becomes a prisoner!!",1116806400,12,752,4.5777777777777775
