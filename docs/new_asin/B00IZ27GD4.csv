6305567,5,B00IZ27GD4,"More superb stories narrated by Dick Powell from the first program created by his Four Star Productions. Hopefully, Timeless will release the rest of this series, as well as the dozen or so other TV shows currently unreleased on disc that were produced by Four Star for all 3 networks from the late '50's through the mid '60's. As mentioned, The Rifleman pilot, The Sharpshooter, is missing from this set, though it is the first episode on the season one DVD set of The Rifleman, and does appear in The Rifleman reruns on television. This is different than the case of Hawaii Five-0, where a second season episode, Bored, She Hung Herself, from 1970, was omitted from the season set and later, the complete series megaset, for legal reasons, but was not commercially available for viewing elsewhere, and is not rerun in syndication.",1397433600,20,832,4.825174825174825
6305568,5,B00IZ27GD4,"Almost five years after VCI released the complete first season of Zane Grey Theater on DVD, Timeless Media has stepped up to offer fans the second season of this great western anthology series hosted by Dick Powell.  And what a season it is!  The 28 episodes feature Hollywood legends like Barbara Stanwyck, Claudette Colbert, Robert Ryan, Howard Keel and Hedy Lamarr, as well as future television stars like Michael Landon, Dan Blocker, Pernell Roberts, James Drury, and DeForest Kelley.

As originally aired, the season also included the pilot for the popular television series ""The Rifleman"", here presented as ""The Sharpshooter"" (episode 2.21).  Due to legal complications, this episode will NOT be included on the four-disc set.  That's disappointing ... but there are still enough treasures here to qualify as five-star, ""must-see"" viewing.

Thank you, Timeless Media!  Here's hoping you won't make us wait another 5 years before you release Zane Grey Theater, Season Three!

was the 2nd season's episode called The Sharpshooter with Chuck Connors, which turned into The Rifleman series, and it is NOT in this pack calling itself Season 2.  Furthermore, whereas the Season One pack of DVDs included all of Dick Powell's introductions, Season 2 has none of his introductions, which always occurred a few minutes into the show, and were an integral part of  Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre.

6305579,3,B00IZ27GD4,"I liked season 1 better although there is some real great actors in this one.
Dick Powell tells some real whoppers on some of his intro's.
Belle Starr had a 10,000 reward on her head - she never had a bounty on her
head let alone 10,000. One of her husbands had a 5000.00 reward on his head
but not Belle.
He then says she was worth even more than the notorious killer Bat Masterson. ( 5000.00 )
He never had a bounty on his head either and best most historians agree he killed 6 men.
Two protecting Molly Brennen, which she was killed and Bat was near death
He also killed the 2 men who murdered his brothers killers. The others as marshall.
But Dick Powell says Theodore Roosevelt had to pardon him to keep him out of the pen.
What the president did do was appoint him US Deputy Marshall in NYC.
This is just two examples but if Dick Powell couldn't tell at least a tiny bit of the truth in
the monologs he shouldn't have done them at all.
Not Belle nor Bat were saints by any means and wore many hats in in their lifetimes and one
would had to be drunk or stupid to rile them but the above goes a way and above the truth. I use
mute button when he comes on. I really like the programs but when the 1st thing I hear is a whopper
it distracts me before they start.
Bat did carry a cane but that was the result of he being shot in the pelvis area in the Molly Brennen
fight. No as a weapon as it shows on tv.
I guess I have studied to much history to be objective.",1428192000,,1464,3.9829931972789114

Each episode was an excellent story of the old west and how it might have been'  The host Dick Powell starred in a few episodes but his weekly intro to each story set the tone for each story.

6305596,4,B00IZ27GD4,"So then, what's this all about? -  just received my copy in the mail knowing that the Rifleman  pilot, aka The Sharpshooter, is not included in this release for legal, whatever legal, reasons , but then Johnny Crawford is featured as Mark McCain, not only on the cover of this DVD, but also prominently on Disc 4, looking very  satisfied. So what's he smiling about, actually he has a little bit part in episode 13 'Man Unforgiving', he's only on for about 30 seconds in the whole show, isn't wearing his famous Mark McCain hat as pictured on the DVD, has only 2 lines, but in one of them says 'My paw..."", anyways, 1 star off for this 'unforgiveable' omission, anyone with a craving of Lucas and Mark McCain can always catch 3 - 5 hours of the Rifleman on the AMC network on Saturday mornings.

Considering all the more famous guest stars that appeared this season that could have been on the cover, such as Robert Vaughn, Tommy Sands, Michael Landon, David Janssen, Nick Adams, or Pernell Roberts, for example, this does seem to be an intentional misrepresentation to have Johnny Crawford on the cover and inside disc, since the Rifleman pilot was probably the most famous episode of all seasons of Zane Grey, but on the back cover it does mention the missing episode in such very fine print that I didn't notice until it was pointed out to me.

The two bonus features make up for the small difference in picture quality and the absence of the episode that was the pilot for ""The Rifleman"" tv series because of legal reasons.  The bonus features are:

I was also disappointed because so many of Dick Powell's pre-show monologs were deleted.  For me, they were great entertainment.  And their ideas of what a sodbuster's house or kitchen might look like was unintentionally funny.  Despite all these problems, the shows are still a pleasure to watch.  Established stars and character actors showed why they were the cream of their crops, and it was fun to see actors who would later become much better known in some of their earliest roles.  I'd forgotten that Robert Vaughn had been suck a scary, grinning homicidal maniac and he carried it off well.  As far as I'm concerned, ""Sundown at Bitter Creek"" was worth the price of the collection.  It wasn't as marvelous as I remembered it, showing its age in a few ways, but it was still a very touching story of a gunfighter condemned to be a sort of Flying Dutchman.  Nostalgia might not be what it used to be, but it was still a pleasure seeing the old shows again.",1456531200,,1123,4.54228855721393
