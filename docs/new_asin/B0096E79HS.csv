8536619,5,B0096E79HS,"Very informative and very edited and put together. I bought this for my dad ( who is a native of Puerto Rico)  he seen it on PBS , he kept talking about how cool it was so I bought it for him for Christmas. I enjoyed watching it with him and  we look forward to visiting the places he went to in the film.",1455062400,,305,3.75

8536621,2,B0096E79HS,"I had high hopes for this one and ended up disappointed in many ways. It starts out nicely with the host, Zay Harding, in San Juan, where he speaks with someone about the island's status, goes to a mojito party, visits the man who made the world's longest cigar and goes with a guide to a restaurant to try the local cuisine.

He then takes a bus ride over to El Yunque rainforest, but (and this is where the episode begins to downturn) does not spend much time there and then we are shown a Puerto Rican parrot being opened up under anesthesia to check to see if it is good for reproducing.

He then visits the island of Vieques, where a necessary discussion about the US military bombing at the island occurs.  The viewer's interest, however, is dissuaded again when the host then decides to go horseback riding by what looks to be a non-Puerto Rican operation.  Why the host chose something that can be done almost anywhere stateside such as horseback riding is puzzling.

The host then visits another seemingly non-Puerto Rican run business by staying at an outdoor hotel which omits a fourth wall and then interviews the owner.

After that, he is off to do some ziplining and spelunking with a guide that has a likeable sense of humor.

Next, the host visits what nearly every American probably already knows about from movies such as ""GoldenEye"" and ""Contact"", the Arecibo observatory - yet another stateside-American run operation.

Finally, the host ends his journey with the coffee bean festival in Maricao and a very touristy Taino re-enactment in Jayuya, but by then the viewer has already felt short-changed and almost like the host never actually visited Puerto Rico, but instead stayed in the continental United States after visiting all of the American-run businesses and not really seeing much of actual Puerto Rican culture.

Here's what I would suggest: Instead of the parrot-probing, the horseriding, the outdoor hotel and the Arecibo observatory, it would have been nice if he had gone to Loiza, the heart of Afro-Puerto Rican culture, gone to Ponce, where a strong tradition of the island's well-known ""bomba y plena"" music is celebrated (besides in Loiza), seen the ""Las Tradicionales"" mask fesival in Hatillo and, if time permitted, gone to Morovis and Orocovis to see an area of the island where the Taino legacy is perhaps most intact.

Furthermore, even though the DVD is listed on here as being 60 minutes, it is, in fact, NOT 60 minutes and closer to 48 minutes.

I have wondered for quite some time now, why on earth the series has never gone to the Dominican Republic, which has become a fairly popular vacation destination in recent years for Americans.  Globe Trekker seems to have done a show on everywhere in the world over the years except that one place.  If they do ever decide to do one on Puerto Rico's neighbor, the Dominican Republic, I hope that they do a much better job on that one than they did for this one. The host is engaging, the music is good, the photography is vivid, but the episode falls short because of all of the places and events it could have gone to, but didn't.

Sorry, the most I can give this one is two stars.  I hope that they do another, better one for Puerto Rico in the near future.",1375747200,9,3251,4.659090909090909
