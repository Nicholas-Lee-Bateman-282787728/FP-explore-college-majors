5157630,5,B008FC2E54,My kids absolutely love this movie. It is not scary like you would think and it shows them the legendary story behind the mexican tale.,1380412800,,135,4.44
5157631,5,B008FC2E54,"I use this film for my Spanish class after we've read and talked about the legend.  Other legends/cultural aspects associated with Mexico are also shown in the film, such ""isla de las Munecas"" and the calaveras characters are cute.  My students really love it.",1358726400,,260,4.886363636363637

5157637,5,B008FC2E54,Awsome cartoon,1416528000,,14,6.5
5157638,4,B008FC2E54,"Very good cartoon version of La Llorona.  However, the previews are extremely inappropriate for viewing before a cartoon!  Beware if you are going to show it to children!",1414108800,,170,5.035714285714286
5157639,3,B008FC2E54,"Okay so I LOVE this movie. Super cute and one of my favorite thus far. The only complaint I have and I should have probably read in previous reviews is the PREVIEWS. Yes the PREVIEWS!!!!!!!! Like a reviewer said they are appropriate for an ADULT film not a kids film. I sat down to watch this with my whole family, which includes a really old sweet grandma and numerous children ages 5-13. Needless to say I was running for the remote ASAP. It's tedious always trying to cover the TV before the actual movie begins. The delivery was great, the movie is super cute and one of my favorite films. However we need to do something about those previews.",1412035200,9,647,4.445378151260504
5157640,5,B008FC2E54,"I love the movie, very entertaining story and so very culturally appropriate for my Spanish classes.

One thing, though, this copy did NOT include English subtitles.  This may or may not be important for teachers, but for my first year 6th graders it's no bueno... I passed my copy along to a colleague who teaches native speakers and purchased a different copy from another seller, one that includes the subtitles.  :-/",1411430400,,420,4.887323943661972
5157641,5,B008FC2E54,"very good movie.  The story is well set up.  The characters are very original, lovely, scary some, and very well defined.  The little girl -human character- is great.  All are funny and it has a touch (well... maybe more than a touch) of fear but ends well :o)  The ending has compassion and understanding.
The colors of the movie, voices and scenography are very good.  I watched it in Spanish, so one can get all the flavor and emotion of this beautiful language and the fun side of the Mexican-specific words.
I loved this movie.",1408233600,,532,4.5473684210526315
5157642,5,B008FC2E54,"Excellent movie, a must see",1408233600,,27,4.6
5157643,3,B008FC2E54,"I really enjoyed this. I am a Spanish teacher, and bought this to use if I need something for a sub unexpectedly. I sure am glad I previewed it. I sat down to watch this with my children (ages 5 and 6) and the first thing that pops up is a preview for a mature movie with explicit words in subtitles at the bottom of the screen. My little kids couldn't read it, and their Spanish is limited mostly to what the see in Dora an Diego, so they couldn't understand, but a class of high school kids...I could have gotten fired.

The previews go on to show naked people rolling around on each other.

The movie was very cute and appropriate for kids. It introduces some Mexican culture in a fun way. The previews, however, caused me to give this a review of only 3 stars. Great movie. Awful previews.",1402617600,15,793,4.245033112582782
5157644,4,B008FC2E54,"This is a good movie to share the legend of La Llorona and it also highlights other legends in Mexico and places.  It was a little silly with all the added characters and the voices are a little annoying.  Otherwise, good",1396569600,,221,4.365853658536586
5157645,5,B008FC2E54,"This classic is a fun and entertaining way to share cross-cultural kid stories with the children in your home, classroom or library. As the parent of a culturally mixed family (US Anglo and Mexican), we love having this fun
Mexican child's legend in our home collection. My daughter absolutely loves it!",1395532800,,303,4.96078431372549
5157646,5,B008FC2E54,"I want to my  grandkids  know about our Mexican  stories, is  something I hear when I was little girl. I like it!",1389398400,,113,4.0
5157647,5,B008FC2E54,"I'm always looking for films to show in my Spanish 1 and 2 class.  This was great!  I loved that it was made in Mexico and since it was for kids the language was pretty basic.  The only downside is that one of the main characters has an annoying voice but my students were willing to ""suffer"" for the chance to have a movie day.  lol",1388707200,,333,4.0
5157648,5,B008FC2E54,I was unsure of the movie at first but I quickly changed my mind. This movie was great both my 6 year old and 3 year were glued to the TV. I too enjoyed it. This movie is all in Spanish but it is subtitled in English. The subtitles were a little quick for my 6 year old so I read them to her during the important parts. I would compare this movie to a really good Scooby-Doo like movie. In the beginning it seemed a little dark for kids but it was fine in the end.,1388534400,3,464,3.7938144329896906
5157649,5,B008FC2E54,"My son loves this movie, everything started with Nana telling night stories about La Llorona, my son was so intrigued, and every time he wanted to know more and more....Now, with this amazing movie he is able to understand more about our Mexican culture and realize that Nana's stories are real and part of our culture. We received this movie yesterday and he keeps playing on and on. It is a great movie for kids to learn Spanish and Mexican culture.  The dialogue in the movie is funny and hilarious. Great characters.",1383264000,,520,4.6521739130434785
5157650,5,B008FC2E54,"Younger children will be challenged by the English subtitles, but children who understand Spanish really enjoy this movie.  Many of them already know the legend of La Llarona and identify with the story.  They want to watch it more than once!",1381363200,,242,4.878048780487805
5157651,5,B008FC2E54,Full of magic!! Love the story...and my 5 and 6 year old see it everyday!! And they always find something new,1380585600,,109,4.238095238095238

8527265,5,B008FC2E54,Great movie and movie quality,1463788800,,29,5.0
8527266,2,B008FC2E54,"I thought this movie would have more of the traditional story of the llorona. Instead it's more about the wacky adventures of these cartoon characters. I had hoped to use it for my Spanish classes as we learned about the llorona, and based on previous reviews, thought it would be good. However, not only is it not the traditional story as I have heard it from other sources, but the cartoon characters are so annoying I could barely get through previewing it, let alone listen to it twice in a day for my Spanish classes. BTW, the previews mentioned earlier as inappropriate must have been removed because mine has no previews at all.",1463529600,2,635,4.628318584070796

8527270,5,B008FC2E54,"A great movie to show to middle school Spanish students. I showed it to 8th graders the day before Da los muertos and they loved it. The story line is engaging and the animations are colorful. It comes with English subtitles, so the students could read the parts they couldn't understand. Fun for all ages!",1446249600,,306,4.581818181818182
8527271,5,B008FC2E54,"Very good and funny movie, ideal for people who really know the Mexican traditions and slang, old and new. Note, if you are not familiar with both of them, don't bother, you won't be able to understand the movie. So, if you are trying to ""learn"" Spanish with this, forget it, you won't.",1429401600,,286,4.415094339622642
