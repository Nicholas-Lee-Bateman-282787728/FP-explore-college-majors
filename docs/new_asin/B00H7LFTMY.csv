6137779,5,B00H7LFTMY,"As a young adult, I watched this show with very low expectations as kids shows aren't made for people my age. My friend however recommended it so I thought I'd give it a try, and I am so glad I did! This show is so creative and intelligent, I am proud to say I am a fan of the first two seasons (the third was really strange for me) because they spark interest and mystery in people imagination. The acting isn't Oscar worthy obviously as they're mostly inexperienced kids, but that is easily overlooked for the stories are so intriguing. They make you want to keep watching, and that's what television shows aim for. So I say well done to the creators/writers of this show. Now I will forever have this wonderfully compelling story to watch whenever I want to!",1484611200,,761,4.442857142857143

6137782,1,B00H7LFTMY,"Hello, Amazon! I'm writing to you because I've had some issues with a package I've just received from your store. A few days ago I ordered the House of Anubis Season One on Blu Ray and I've just received it. I was, however, very disappointed to find out that it doesn't work. I put the first disk in and there was only a black screen to look at. I thought it might be my PS4, so I tried it on a regular Blu Ray player. Nothing changed, it still wouldn't play. I decided to try the remaining two disks, and they both work fine. I noticed the back of the first disk looks different than the others, so that might have something to do with the issue, I would assume. I'm not angry, however, I can't exactly watch a show that's missing half the episodes. That being said, I'd like to receive my complete series that I paid for, can that be arranged? Thank you so much for your time.",1482451200,,878,4.170588235294118

6137791,5,B00H7LFTMY,"I used to watch some of the first season of House of Anubis when it played on tv. Then, when I went back to college, I finished watching the whole season! I couldn't stop watching because the plot was really interesting. Even as a 21 year old I enjoyed watching the shenanigans and mysteries, the adventure and the drama, that unfolded in the house. I really love that there are a lot of Egyptian references, too! My whole family loved this show including my then 6 year old brother, 13 year old sister, and 19 year old sister. I bought this dvd version because I can't find the episodes anywhere and if you were to buy each episode online it would add up to be a lot more than this set. I can't wait to rewatch it with my family! Definitely a must have to your dvd collection if you're into this kind of stuff! Also, the characters aren't flat; they all have unique personalities with a lot to offer in the show. There are enough different things going on to make you appreciate every character and what they go through, not just the main character Nina.",1444953600,,1055,4.3604060913705585

6137814,5,B00H7LFTMY,"My 2 daughters, who were 9yr and 11yr at the time, and I actually started watching this show when it first premiered on Nickelodeon. We quickly started looking forward to each new episode that they started having every night during the week. For anyone who is not familiar with House of Anubis, it is about an American teen, Nina, who joins a group of students at a British boarding school where upon arrival one of the students has already been suspected missing. The school is run by a creepy caretaker who keeps a stuffed raven as his pet. The missing student's friend Patricia immediately suspects Nina has something to do with it. Nina meets an old lady who claimed she use to live at the Anubis house and she gives Nina a locket and tells her to guard it and that there is a treasure hidden in the house. Nina confides in a select few of the group of students and they see that the locket has powers and they have to figure out clues to the treasure. They form a group called Sibuna. The series ran for 3 seasons. My daughters and I never missed an episode. In my opinion it keeps you always wanting to find out what happens next.  The show is only a half hour long and with commercials even less. The dvd's are great they play one episode after another without commercials with the opening and closing credits dividing each episode. This dvd set is the whole of Season 1. I highly recommend this dvd for any House of Anubis fan.",1393891200,18,1435,4.394736842105263
6137815,5,B00H7LFTMY,"I've been waiting for this series to be released in the R1 DVD format for awhile now. It's a much better deal than buying the episodes on something like itunes. I'm not going to really talk about the series itself, if you want to know the plot go on wiki, all I'm going to say about the series is I think it's fantastic. Anyway on to the box set itself, for one it's packaged nicely, all 5 discs fit in a stranded DVD case. The cover features a nice picture and the back of the case looks good as well. The only problem I have is that the menus are very boring. On all five discs you get the same menu with the DVD cover and a play all or pick an episode button. There are no special features at all. Other than that it has all the episodes and it's at a good price",1391817600,7,765,3.9419354838709677
6137816,5,B00H7LFTMY,"This is a show that I believe all children, teenagers, and even parents will like. It has all the aspects a show must have, and it avoids everything other shows doesn't like drugs or alcohol, etc.",1391299200,3,196,4.472222222222222

8630564,2,B00H7LFTMY,The first disc won't play past the FBI anti- piracy warning. It is a real bummer because that is 9 (or 18) episodes that I can't watch. The other two discs work wonderfully though.,1525392000,,180,4.323529411764706

It had all 5 discs and no scratches whatsoever. The episodes themselves weren't blurry or dull in color. Overall, a great buy! Especially at this price! Will definitely get season 2 as well.
