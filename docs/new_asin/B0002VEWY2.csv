2127490,5,B0002VEWY2,"I think that this like Eloise at the Plaza is a great movie.  It is one that childern of all ages can really enjoy. I really can't think of anyone that would not enjoy this movie.

I also think that Elise At The Plaza, is a great movie for all.",1102032000,,244,3.86
2127491,5,B0002VEWY2,"I have 5 children ranging from 14 years to 20 months and they all loved this movie. I rented the video and after watching it went right out and bought it the next day. Eloise was fun, the movie was lighthearted and watchable by all ages. The little girl who plays Eloise was such a gem. Julie Andrews was just as wonderful as Nanny as she was as Mary Poppins. This is a movie I could enjoy watching over and over again.",1101686400,,419,4.121951219512195
2127492,5,B0002VEWY2,"Great movie!! if you liked the first one, you defintely like this one!!  It brings out the kid in you, (I think we all have one)

totally recommend it!! even for us adults ;)",1101600000,,174,4.088235294117647
2127493,5,B0002VEWY2,"I grew up in the fifties with the Eloise books, and although I thought they were cute, this movie brought them to life and much more.  The Eloise of the books was comical, but the movie gave Eloise heart and soul beyond humor.  The characters literally seemed to leap off the pages of the book and come to life.  Sofia (Eloise) is as perfect in the part as a girl could be--bold, saucy, mischievous, and good-hearted.  And Julie Andrews as nanny is as nannyish as could be--authentic, heartwarming, and funny.  I enjoyed every moment of this movie and would recommend it to everyone, young and old.",1101340800,2,598,4.60377358490566
2127494,4,B0002VEWY2,"I love this movie. The movie itself deserves 4 stars. It is great for kids. However, the dvd I recieved didn't even play. It was only showing black & grey snowy pixels. Luckily, I was able to find another DVD at Walmart for $5.",1515801600,,227,4.181818181818182

2127499,3,B0002VEWY2,"This is a cute movie, but if my kids actually behaved this way, I'd have to give 'em a whoppin' every morning before breakfast! This is of course a clean movie w no cursing, or anything out of line. Ok for small kids too. Eloise even offers to invite someone she doesn't like at all to eat Christmas dinner with them because she feels bad that the person will spend the holiday alone. She buys gifts for everyone, putting thought into getting them things they actually would like to receive. On the other side, she is disobedient, hyper, disrespectful, does whatever she wants w/o regard to consequences and tears up everything she touches. You could use it as a guide to teach your kids how NOT to behave!!",1513296000,,707,4.53125
2127500,5,B0002VEWY2,"This is a great Christmas movie.  My 8-year-old niece started watching it, and within 20 minutes all the adults were gathered around the TV howling with laughter.  Lots of fun, suitable for the entire family.",1512691200,,208,4.914285714285715

2127535,5,B0002VEWY2,"I watched this movie last year for the first time & loved it. I searched every channel on TV this Christmas so I could watch it again, but I could not find it listed anywhere. I went to Amazon hoping to order it & found it & also ""Eloise at the Plaza"".
Julie Andrews plays the Nanny & she is hilarious & Eloise is played by Sofia Vassilieva, who is delightful & funny. The entire cast set at The Plaza in New York makes this a movie I will want to watch every year especially at Christmas. If you haven't seen it yet, check it out, your family will enjoy it as a classic, fun film.

2127540,3,B0002VEWY2,"I absolutely adore this movie. I have watched it on TV every Christmas for as long as I can remember. I figured that it was about time to own it so that I wouldn't have to try to catch it on TV.

I read the reviews before buying this DVD. Some reviewers mentioned that the quality of the DVD wasn't the best. I assumed that it would be fine and that the reviewers were overreacting. However, now that I have watched the DVD, I agree with the other reviewers. The quality is not as good as a normal DVD. When you watch the DVD, you notice that there are pauses in it where I assume commercials once were. It makes me think that the DVD somehow took a version from TV and adapted it. As such, the quality is of a TV version that has been adapted. While the quality is not absolutely terrible and does not make the DVD unwatchable, it is noticeable.

I would recommend spending a couple extra dollars to buy this movie elsewhere, where you can assure that the quality will be of a true DVD.",1482883200,2,987,4.189473684210526

This book allowed me to share some time with her (Lila), to point out just how special she is!! Her younger sister by 13 months has taken the lead with just how much she is a ""princess"" and how ""pretty"" she is!! Lila, says she can't be what her sister is, smart, pretty, popular, sporty etc.  So after seeing this moving and the time I had with her before I left back to CA, she not only fell in love with Eloise, but is beginning to see her ""cup 1/2 full"" instead of ""cup 1/2 empty.""  (Much like her daddy (my son) use to struggle with with his younger brother when I was a single parent in their elementary-high school years.

2127883,5,B0002VEWY2,"More fun from the diabolical Eloise (""Once, I threw up on Coco Chanel."").  When she's not working out a Trojan horse method of gaining entry into a storeroom filled with Christmas presents, she's busy working overtime spreading joy (and chaos) through the Plaza Hotel.  The plot here is quite similar to that of the former film, an overbearing parent riding roughshod over their daughter's life.  This time the ogre is the owner of the Plaza, Mr. Peabody (Victor A. Young), who kept his daughter (Sara Topham) from getting romantically entangled with a lowly waiter (Gavin Creel).  Firing him would have been much cheaper than sending his daughter away to college, but there you have it, the complexities of a simple minded story.  Naturally, he's finally made to see the error of his ways and has an instant (and totally unbelievable) change of heart.  Dopey plot aside, the best moments involve Nanny (Emmy nominated Julie Andrews) and the incorrigible Eloise (Sofia Vassilieva).  The only sour note is the shrill and overbearing performance by Christine Baranski (Prunella Stickler)  who scowls and shrieks her way through the entire film.  Otherwise, it's quite enchanting.",1386288000,,1177,5.152631578947369

Great movie for all little girls - and my stepson at age 6 even got some enjoyment out of her meddlesome frolicking.

When I worked for a library, I took home several of the titles of the Eloise books to read to my siblings. We loved the books and now I am enjoying this refreshingly clean and fun movie series. The first one is called Eloise at the Plaza. I do hope they write more scripts and film the rest of the series.
Eloise is this rambunctious, loud, and very mischievous child who lives in the Plaza hotel. She loves to change the way the hotel is managed with her sneaky way of stirring things up a bit. She is a charmer to some and a brat to others, but as you watch you will fall in love with every part about her! I recommend the books and movies to everyone.",1329696000,,793,4.1558441558441555

In Eloise at Christmastime, precocious 6-year-old Eloise (Sofia Vaissilieva in a wonderfully exuberant performance) plays matchmaker. It is almost Christmas, and everyone at the Plaza is excited. Eloise learns that Rachel (Sara Topham) who is the daughter of Plaza owner, Mr. Peabody (Victor Young) is about to marry Brooks Oliver (Rick Roberts). Eloise also discovers that her favorite waiter and best friend Bill (Gavin Creel) used to be Rachel's sweetheart and is still in love with her. Eloise, in her usual inimitable fashion, decides to play matchmaker and bring the two together.

There's also Eloise's nanny, played by the amazing Julie Andrews. Nanny is such a wonderful character, always guiding Eloise, and being kind and compassionate. Nanny is truly a gem! Eloise here is a bit more grown-up in the sense that she truly tries to do something for others out of generosity, kindness, and compassion. This is a wonderful family-friendly Christmas movie that will warm young hearts at Christmastime.",1324512000,,1392,5.752427184466019

I love the characters - Eloise is full of sass, but she has a good heart.  Julie Andrews is wonderful as Nanny!  I adore her!  There are two cute romances going on (which Eloise has a hand in, of course).  I also love watching her interactions with the hotel staff (especially Max).

2127940,4,B0002VEWY2,"Picking up shortly after the events of the first film, ""Eloise at the Plaza"", this film begins with the arrival of Christmastime, and the arrival of Mr. Peabody's daughter. She has a secret to share, she's engaged to be married. And her fiance also has a secret share. Later it becomes apparent than Eloise's friend, Bill, was an old love of the aforementioned woman, named Rachel.  The chemistry between Bill and Rachel is obviously more evident than Brooks and Rachel. Eloise recongizes this, and hopes to take the wedding into her own hands.
 The film progresses over the course of the following days, as the arrival of ""Christmas Eve Eve"", and eventually concludes at ""Christmas Eve"". You watch as ""Nanny"" continues to expand upon her romantic interest with Mr. Wilkes, from the previous film. While the plot is more shallow than the first, the twist is equally as predictable. That being said, the film has a more joyous feel than the previous entry.

Just as the first film, there's no profanity, no crude humor, and acceptability among family audiences.
It is not necessary to watch the previous film prior to watching this. However the first film does introduce a lot of the characters present in this one (and some only get minor screen time this go around).

It's almost Christmas, and Eloise (Sofia Vassilieva) is postively overrun with errands that she must complete before the big day.  First on the list is to perform a little counter-matchmaking for Peabody's daughter Rachel (Sara Topham) who has returned from Europe with a most unsuitable fianc.  Then there's cranky, unloved Mrs Thornton (Corinne Conley) who is being forced to leave the Plaza because of financial reverses.  Christmas cheer is on the way...Eloise-style!

ELOISE AT CHRISTMASTIME is the perfect continuation of Disney's ""Eloise at the Plaza"", again starring Julie Andrews as Nanny with the bulk of the main characters from the first installment also back for more fun (Gavin Creel as Bill, Jeffrey Tambor as Mr Salomone, Debra Monk as Maggie, Christine Baranski as Prunella Stickler, and Kenneth Welsh as Sir Wilkes).  It's a real shame they never extended the series by also adapting the ""Paris"" and ""Moscow"" books.

The new storyline involves the Plaza owner, his daughter, and one of the staff members that appears in ""Eloise at the Plaza."" It is a charming story of mystery and romance with Eloise once again in her exceptional role as a mischievous, but good-hearted child who only wants to make other peoples' lives better while having some fun along the way. Her antics are believable from a child's point of view and never have any lasting damaging effects, although they can be temporarily uncomfortable for those around her.

2127967,2,B0002VEWY2,"I know how ""adorable"" Sofia Vassilieva supposedly comes across--but the character of Eloise she portrays in this Yuletide-themed disaster is nothing short of a horrific, negative example for children everywhere.

She's pushy.  She's snotty.  She disregards Nanny's beautifully-accented orders at every turn.  Little Eloise also mistakenly believes that since her father owns the Plaza, it's her birthright to interfere in the private lives of both staff and guests.

Now, clearly Disney transforms this nightmarish little Puck into an agent of Cupid and everything (as usual) turns out peachy keen for all involved.

Still, Eloise is a pint-sized terror.  I was hoping someone would toss the midget, mouthy malcreant down one of the Plaza's many elevator shafts.

One of the less tiresome moments for the character is at the very end, when a mysterious, face-cannot-be-glimpsed female figure (decked out in a fabulous mink coat--props for the outerwear) grandly arrives.  It's Eloise's mother.  Who apparently only can stand being in the presence of her child two or three times of the year.

We read those stories over and over and thought that Eloise and all of her antics were hillarious to the point that my sister and I wanted to BE Eloise.  However, when my sister purchased this movie for my 3 year old daughter I was a little concerned.  Though I love the Eloise stories, I didn't necessarily think that Eloise was the best role model for my impressionable young daughter.  However, to my very happy surprise, Disney has managed to present an adorable, sweet, caring version of the little girl from the books,  while still staying true to so many of her little quirks and mischief that make her so lovable and entertaining.

This movie is very well acted all around, especially by the Eloise and Nanny (Julie Andrews) characters, both of whom have a warmth and sweetness not evident in the book that only adds to movie version and makes it much more appropriate for kids.  Purists of the book that are looking for pure sass and troublemaking in Eloise may thinik the movie too soft, but it is a perfect interpretation for family viewing.

Little Eloise is done wonderfully by Sophia who plays the michviously little girl who just loves Christmas at the plaza. Eloise manages to change lives close to Christmas day having old friends re-connect as lovers and rescue a friend from a doomed marriage or help a grieving mother manage to stay at her home. Not to mention getting into plenty of trouble and buying heaps of presents. Eloise all in all has the life every little girl wants to have. I found myself dreaming about being at the Plaza at Christmastime myself.

My little cousin loved the movie and I enjoyed it myself. It's a perfect movie to add to your Christmas collection or just to watch with your kids. Right now, we're watching it in Febuary!!!

2127976,4,B0002VEWY2,"Unlike the curmudgeon above, I enjoyed this movie because I took it as it was intended, a children's movie.

  I have a 6 year old daughter who is exposed incessantly to appeals to the lowest common denominator in the form of twisted concepts of human sexualtiy, myopic schooling, and rank commercialism, amongst others.  I am attempting with everything in me to rear a daughter with self confidence, intelligence, and above all the will to express herself in the face of adversity.

  While I have substantial concern with the setting of Eloise, the underlying themes of the film I believe supercede the lifestyle of privlege portrayed.  These themes are independence of thought, self confidence, innocence as a power for good, and the triumph of the free thinker over social castes.

  It is indeed pablum, but pablum is extremely beneficial in it's context.

  This film is light hearted, amusing, shallow, and utterly enchanting for the young at heart, including reluctant adults.  Disney has it's place, and should not be rearing our children, but for a parent with interest in their child's upbringing, able to reinforce the beneficial aspects of the film, this quintessentially Disney movie is entirely pleasant.

2127977,2,B0002VEWY2,"I've always loved Kay Thompson's brilliant ""Eloise"" books.  Eloise was born 3 years before me, although she benefits from a case of arrested development (not unlike Dennis the Menace), having reached the age of 6 in 1955 and never aging since. I've been to the Plaza Hotel as a child in the late '50s and early '60s, and my mother spent many happy years in the Big Apple, some as a Barbizon resident.

My grandmother once remarked to my mother that the oil portrait of Eloise in the Plaza lobby made her think ""She must be the manager's daughter,"" since no other explanation could account for such an ""ugly child"" being so prominently displayed!  Kay Thompson was a graduate of the same high school in St. Louis as my mother, and went on to achieve many wonderful, gutsy, triumphs in Hollywood as a dancer, choreographer, designer, and actress (including her role in ""Funny Face"" with Fred Astaire and Audrey Hebburn as the Vogue-ish magazine editor who advocated ""Think pink!"").  I greatly admire the multi-talented and mercurial Thompson and her  inspired illustrator, Hilary Knight who did as much as Thompson to bring Eloise to life.  For that matter, I very much like Eloise herself, who was by all accounts Kay Thompson's alter-ego.

The first Eloise book was subtitled ""A book for precocious grownups, about a little girl who lives at the Plaza Hotel.""  Eloise was a child, but the books were not meant for children. Adults, especially those who've raised children of their own, understand that children are not Better, Wiser, Smarter, and Kinder than adults. But since at least ""Pollyanna"" if not before, Disney Studios has been churning out a constant stream of propaganda films asserting just the opoosite.

And now, Kay Thompson's wonderful playful, innocent, bratty, obnoxious, sweet Eloise has been beatified by Disney as their latest Child Sage.  The problem with these lies (and all others) is that they blind people of all ages to their own shortcomings while unfairly blaming them on others.

Children are not wiser and better than adults, and they never have been, and they never will be, even if Jimmy Carter did think his 11-year-old daughter Amy had the last word to say about nuclear weapons (he was mistaken, of course).  Children are typically much more cruel than adults, and if they say sweet innocent things from time to time (which is rare) it is only because they haven't lived long enough to learn better.

But they will learn better eventually; although some of them will suppress or deny their life-lessons to become seriously committed adult hypocrites.  Adults who don't get this either don't have children, or don't pay attention to them as they really are, Disney Studios' party line notwithstanding.

In the books, Eloise's charm lay in her vulnerabiltity, her precociousness, her smart-aleck attitude, and her essential warmth, which asked no quarter and took no prisoners...delightful as childish qualities, but lacking in, shall we say...nuance.  Disney tries to make her into an all-wise marriage counselor and social activist do-gooder. As such, Eloise is transformed from a delightful child into a *very adult* sociopathically manipulative prig, which quite ruins the film...as it also ruins real life when people go wrong like that.

This was never the character Thompson and Knight developed, who was simply a charming self-absorbed brat...and, by the way, a lot more credible as an actual child.  Eloise's future as an adult has been speculated upon. Some think her a likely candidate for alcholism, drug addiction, and perhaps certain dysfunctional sexual disorders, as an adult child of an absentee mother and no father at all, raised in circumstances of artificial material luxury and moral decadence.

Such concerns are not unfocused, but since we all know that Eloise will never, and can never, get any older than 6 years of age, they are, I would suggest, unwarranted.

Meanwhile, I wish Disney Studios would either go away or do something else.  Of course ""children of all ages"" (sanctimonious children and smug, narcissistic adults who can't or won't grow up) will eat this junk up as Disney knows very well.

But I think Kay Thompson would spin in her grave at this PC propagandistic re-working of her own special ""inner child"" who was so much more real than this Disney caricacture: not despite, but because of, her obvious childish failings.

On the plus side, the film's production values could not be better, and the little girl who plays Eloise is...perfect.  Julie Andrews is absolutely wonderful as Nanny.  The sets are great.  I loved the first half hour of this film, before the Disney message (children, especially little girls, are the Master Race) became apparent.  It's certainly well done!  I did wonder, since there seemed to be an emphasis on making the time frame seem 1950s-like, why the featured toy store was Toys R Us instead of New York's flagship toy store, F.A.O. Schwartz?",1103846400,18,4952,5.013431013431013
2127978,5,B0002VEWY2,"Eloise, she is such fun. And I wish that I could live in the Plaza and share her adventures, and be her 'Mostly Companion.' Eloise played by Sophia Vassilieva was a perfect choice and was absolutely divine. And of course Julie Andrews!!! She is wonderful!

Everyone, in this film, is just so wonderful, that you feel that you are there! Everything is realistic, but make believe at the same time! Eloise, the clever, bratty, fun, loveable, sweet, and so caring is just the character that little girls love!

This movie is about 4 really main characters: Eloise (of course), Bill (the waiter) Nanny (Nanny), and Rachel, (The Plaza owners daughter). Eloise becomes involved in matchmaking. When Rachel returns from college with her fiance, Eloise and her become friends. And she finds out that Rachel loved the plaza when she was her age. She also finds out that her and Bill are old sweethearts and still secretly in love, against the will of her father who wants her to marry someone of importance.

And Brooks, her fiance is in his opinion perfect. But Eloise discovers Brookes secret, and contrives plots to get him out of the way and to put Bill in his place. Whether it's being kidnapped, spying, or helping the awful Mrs. Thornton have a Merry Christmas, Kevin Lima makes Eloise shine in the true spirit of the holidays!

Merry Christmas!",1102809600,33,1343,4.775862068965517
2127979,5,B0002VEWY2,"Eloise is a six-year-old girl. While her mom travels the world, Eloise (Sofia Vassilieva) spends most of her time in New York City's Plaza Hotel, where she lives with her ""mostly companion"", rawther British Nanny (Julie Andrews). Eloise has quite the reputation at the Plaza; all of the employees know her routine daily adventures of curiousity and mischief.

Eloise at Christmastime is the second Wonderful World of Disney television movie adapted from Kay Thompson's popular line of picture books. Filmed directly after Eloise at the Plaza, this 2003 film retains director Kevin Lima and all of the relevant cast of its predecessor.

It's Christmastime in New York City, and Eloise anticipates her mother's return home. Meanwhile, in her ritual explorations, Eloise discovers a different return: the daughter (Sara Topham) of Plaza owner Mr. Peabody (Victor Young) has come home to be married on Christmas Eve to Brooks Oliver (Rick Roberts), a Harvard-educated young man that Eloise has her suspicions about.

Eloise's journeys around the Plaza also uncover that the crabby Mrs. Thornton's days at the Plaza may be numbered, though not as she first assumes. And the precocious girl later learns that her best friend and regular room service provider Bill (Gavin Creel), still has feelings for his ex-girlfriend, the soon-to-be-wed Rachel Peabody who he hasn't seen in years.

The film is comfortable in exploring the Plaza with the same pace and perspective of its rambunctious young matchmaker protagonist. It's never in any hurry to bring you the upbeat conclusion you seem to anticipate, instead choosing to bask in the drama and fun of Eloise's experiences.

From the title, you can imagine that Christmas figures largely in the film, and it does. We see Eloise going shopping around Manhattan (her ease contrasts with Nanny's struggle to find the perfect gift for Sir Wilkes), adding to her growing list of things she'd like to get, and inadvertently and repeatedly thwarting Nanny's efforts to decorate their suite. But Christmas is one element and not the entire film, so we're not simply getting the same character-transformation tale that's been played out in countless other holiday TV movies.

The central story actually seems better developed and more compelling than the screenplay for Eloise at the Plaza did. Whereas that one split its interest more evenly between its royalty and romance subplots, this film primarily focuses on the potential between Bill and Rachel, and Eloise's efforts to put them together. The setting of Christmas adds a layer of depth, but never dominates.

All in all, Christmastime succeeds as much as and even more than Plaza, again making good use of Eloise's infectious spirit and this time for a more engaging story. Julie Andrews and the remarkable Sofia Vassilieva have winning chemistry, and their characters' relationship adds a bit of resonance to make the rest of this jovial comedy echo a little more poignantly. Even if it's a tiny bit formulaic, Eloise at Christmastime compares favorably with a good amount of the theatrical live action fare that Walt Disney Pictures have put out in recent years.
