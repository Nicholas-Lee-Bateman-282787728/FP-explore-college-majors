With a spectacular plot, amazing music and very detailed art I  was addicted after the first ten minutes, and I'm sure you will be too!",931305600,3,292,4.0344827586206895
804754,4,6304198841,"I personally like the subbed version better. But they are basically the same, and I consider this important to learning about Shinji. You would think that being given the chance to pilot a giant robot would make any person go wild with glee. I know I would, also being a gundam fan. But Shinji doesn't like it, and the feelings of hate and friendliness from his classmates just confuse him even more. These two episodes are essential in learning about Shinji's relationship with his evangelion. It's good. Watch it.",994809600,,515,4.797752808988764
804755,4,6304198841,"This series starts off as a standard ""Giant Robot"" Anime story but it takes some very interesting turns. Evangelion is popular for good reasons. Be warned: Once you start watching this series, you won't want to stop.",994636800,,216,4.864864864864865
804756,5,6304198841,"Neon Genesis Evangelion is wonderful, thought-provoking Pseudo-Christian drama.",993081600,,79,9.0
804757,5,6304198841,"This is the second video in the series and it contains episodes three and four.  These episodes are less acessible to the averavge Evangelion watcher than the other episodes.  There is less sex, violence, and mystery than in later videos, but I still feel that this is a valuable part of the series.  It explores the main character's own feelings on his control of the EVA, which are actually not as one would think them to be.
*********************************************************************************************** In episode three, Shinji meets both fame and hate at the local school when they find out he pilioted the EVA.  But he wans neither.  He does end up making two new friends, who follow him around.  He doesn't seem to notice, however and runs into problems when yet another angel attacks the new fortress city of Tokyo-3.
In episode four, Shinji's inner character, as well as his now strong relationship with Misato, are delved into as he runs away from NERV.  In this episode we do end up discovering some more info about the EVA's and who can piloit them.  Shinji's new friends are in this episode as well.",988416000,,1129,4.968085106382978
804758,5,6304198841,"The series begins to hit its stride in episodes three and four.  In these episodes we learn more about the reluctant young hero shinji, and his supervisor/roomate Misato.  The excitement never lets up at NERV, and Shinji makes new friends at school.  Though Shinji struggles with his fears and self-doubts, we begin to get a more in-depth view of him as 3 dimensional character.",987465600,,378,4.875
804759,4,6304198841,"Neon Genesis Evangelion is an exciting sci-fi series and I love it.  Genesis 0:2 contains episodes 3 and 4 of the series.  The main character, Shinji, is just settling in to his new school.  He has no friends and is stressed out about having to pilot EVA again.  Soon his classmates discover his secret, and one isn't too happy about it. Unfortunately, emergency strikes and Shinji isn't sure if he can go on piloting EVA anymore.  Alone and depressed, he decides to run away. The dubbed voices were done very well, in my opinion, and nothing was left out.  The reason I give this tape four stars is because it's a bit slow-moving compared to the rest of the series.  This volume is meant to introduce the audience to who Shinji really is, as well as introduce a couple new characters.  The series is a treat for anime fans everywhere.",982540800,,835,4.52
804760,5,6304198841,"The fist volume had me capitivated from the opening song till the ending credits of episode 2. In this volume Shinji is trying to learn how to piolet Evangelion unit 1, yet he must also learn how to deal with his class  mates, which can prove to be even more challenging, especially when one of  them blames him for the injuries his sister sustained in Shinji's first  battle with an Angel. Yet when another Angel attacks Shinji must rise to  the call of duty again. This time he must also protect the lives of two of  his class mates. The emotional drama grows strong in episode 4 as Misato  and Shinji conflict about his prefromance in episode 3. Misato's voice  sounds much more mature in this volume, thank god. This is a must see for  anyone intrested in anime or a fasinating story. Warning contains some  violence and language.",960940800,,834,4.543624161073826
804761,5,6304198841,"This movie is awsome! All evangelion is awsome! It has to be the best anime series ever! I recomened these in subtitles. The dub voice are enough to make a person go loony for a month, but the japanese voices are  beautiful! Don't ever get anime dubbed. I fully recomend this movie to  anyone, but not to small children.",953769600,,320,4.406779661016949
804762,5,6304198841,"Well, what can I say? It was really, really cool. The first few minutes of the episode is very thrilling, then comes the stopped but very good parts. When you first see this episode, it may look like it's only showing how  life is, how Shinji thinks and all that, but, when you see the other  episodes, you realize that the Anime was already telling the end of the  whole thing. It sure is the most intelligent Anime I've ever seen. Besides  that, there is the best Animation ever. Believe me. I'm not lying. And  don't forget to spot everything you can. It will come in handy later.  Every-body that apears in this episode will be back. I've already seen the  whole series, and this one is still one of the best episodes. in fact, all  of them are.",947721600,2,749,4.338129496402877

7864300,5,6304198841,"It has been almost 7 years since I've seen the series which was telivised back in the day. Though back then in my early teen years I didn't quite understand the meaning and the messages behind this great story, I was captivated by the artistic movement of this series. This collection shows the series just like it was telivised, but it has an alternartive las four episodes which shows deleted secenes and extra things. Though I feel kinda teased about the fact that they only show the last four episodes and not the whole series (meaning deleted scenes and stuff). I'm not giving it a thumbs down...I defenetly recommend it. This is great stuff.",1197849600,,647,4.684210526315789
7864301,5,6304198841,"okay first off,it's me again,Kaitie. But anyway this dvd has episodes:

6-rei II

7-a human work

8-asuka strikes

9-both of you dance like you wanna win!

10-magma driver

I loved this dvd,it is one of my favorites of the 7. I really liked this one becuase it introduces asuka!!She is my favorite character! Also it has the really funny episode 9,that is also one of my favorite episodes! Episode 9 is soo funny and awsome and it brings out asuka and shenjis personality,i love it!

But if you want to buy  this dvd i reccomand that you buy the platinum collection box set with all volumes...only becuase it looks way better and less expensive...but most of all it is just better and easier plus prettier with the pretty box set sitting with your dvds. Asuka and Rei look nice on your shelf or were ever. It is also better for a die hard fan or just a good fan of neon genesis!

Well i hope this review helped you! Bye!!

7864302,5,6304198841,"when I watched the first eva dvd I was a little dissapointed.....I thought the show was vastly overrated,but it held my interest enogh to get me to buy #2 and im glad I did...the show is getting better and better (I heard it REALLY picks up later in the series)

my favorite moment of this dvd is in the last episode ""magma diver"" it involves a hot spring a bottle of shampoo and thermal expansion....thats all im gonna say",1126224000,,423,4.3544303797468356
7864303,4,6304198841,ok this is a great anime the evas are cool being a teenage piolet what could go rong it is a good anime fun to watch i hope u like it if u buy it if u don't ur missing out on a good anime,1123545600,,187,3.1777777777777776
7864304,5,6304198841,"When I got the DVD, I was a little skepticle, and the fact that the main character is a bit of a wimp didn't boost my support for the series. But after I got past the first DVD I was into it. This is a story of a boy named Shinji, who pilots an Eva robot that has some hidden aspects to it. The story has little suprises and some very funny moments and gets you more and more interested as the series moves onward.  In so many ways the series is creepy, tense and laughable and even somewhat confusing. Even so, it keeps you interested. I saw the horrors of the truth behind the Evas and their true forms. This is an awesome series for kids 13+. The character realationships are so real and somewhat sad. I like this series a lot and  I reccomend it to anyone who likes a series about a boy and his robot. But don't be fooled. this runs deeper than just a boy/robot plot and don't get discouraged by the first DVD. It has a pretty good opening song and an ok ending song. Actually the ending song sucks, but the opener makes up for that. This is an awesome series, and it's a real eye opener. I don't really reccomend trying to use this to go to sleep with. Again, the first DVD is ok, but don't place your judgements on that one. And do watch it because it DOES explain a lot. The story is not what it appears to be and beyond the beginning is a sad, painful and intense story. It keeps the mind moving. Two thumbs up!",1117929600,,1419,4.082437275985663
7864305,4,6304198841,This is #2 in the reissues of Evangelion. There's no additional content if you already bought the original DVD's. The film transfers and Dolby 5.1 Audio are excellent as usual. The commentaries were the best part of the DVD. I love listening to the staff and cast talk about the feelings and opinions of what they did. For the price the episodes per disk on the Platinum Collection are great. Sadly there aren't any extra trinkets like the NERV parking sticker in the Neon Genesis Evangelion - Platinum Collection 1. Buy it if you've never owned or seen Evangelion. This is an anime that every fan should watch.,1099180800,4,611,4.666666666666667
7864306,5,6304198841,"This review applies to the whole entire series, not just this disk. Never before has any anime, or even movie enthralled and move me as much as this. The direction is fantastic and the some of the characters will make your heart ache. If you are a fan of anime you OWE it to yourself to watch this. Asuka is personally my favourite as the fiery redhead who uses agressive and intimidation to hide her vulnerable self.",1098835200,2,417,4.428571428571429
7864307,4,6304198841,"This is the second DVD in the Neon Genesis Platinum collection, a re-make of the original Neon Genesis Evangelion Anime series with enhanced picture and audio quality. The animation has been restored and improved to ""modern"" standards so that this DVD will produce a very crisp and clear picture. Next to that they have also enhanced the sound tracks; the original Japanese audio is available in 5.1 surround and the English audio tracks have been reworked as well. I hope that it will be re-assuring to know that if you're already used to the English dubs of the original serie that you'll feel right at home listening to this one.

Next to that this DVD also features new contents, even though some scenes may be very hard to spot if you have no material as comparison. You may very well consider the Platinum series to be the full batch of the Director Cut's.

There are 5 Evangelion episodes on the disk (6 through 10: Rei II (also known as 'Showdown in Tokio 3'), A human work, Asuka Strikes!, Both of you: Dance like you want to win!, Magma diver) as well as some extra 'fan service' ;-)

So on to the special treats...  As the name already points out the Platinum series isn't just a mere re-run. Next to the improvements mentioned above this DVD is shipped in a silver cover (""slip over"") which features a line drawing of Rei in her plugsuit on the front and a description of whats on the DVD on the back. The DVD box itself lists about the same plus on the back the episode names written out in Kanjii and the original air dates.

Then there's a 12 page booklet inside which describes the episodes, features some very nice pictures from the series and gives you some insight info on the encountered Angels as well.

And finally the reason why I think things are getting better... On the first DVD we were only treated with 2 audio commentary tracks as well as the always present clean opening and ending (yes, the opening/closing are also present on this DVD). This DVD features an audio commentary track with Tiffany Grant (English voice actress for Asuka) and Allison Shipp (English voice actress for Misato).

And then there's what I consider the real treat: an Animatic for episode 9 (Both of you; dance like you want to win!). Here we are treated with the episode containing only original material: drawings in poor quality (read the stories about the original material getting worse? Now you can see for yourself) as well as line drawn sketches of scenes and producer notes. Now _this_ is getting the fans what they want in my opinion!

So there you have it...  Now for a closing personal comment: if you are a fan of the series then there is no way around this release when considering the extras on the disk. And when looking at the fact that they have shipped 10 episodes (almost half of the original amount of 26) on 2 disks (so the first 3 disks may very well list the whole first half of the serie) I can't help wonder if the Platinum serie will have 6 ""episode disks"" and one ""bonus disk"".  That could be a real treat...",1096848000,23,3042,4.514545454545455
