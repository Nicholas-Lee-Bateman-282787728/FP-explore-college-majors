8688390,5,B00PKJYFEI,"Despite there being only 1500 people in an 8,000 seat arena this was still a great show. I've seen every Lockdown ppv and this may be one of the best in my opinion. The opening 6-Man Tag cage match was great, it does slow down for 35 minutes after that but the show then picks back up for the rest of the event. The Last Man Standing match (Storm vs. Gunner) and the Knockouts Championship match (Kim vs. Rayne) were both especially brutal and violent. Both great matches. The World Title Submission match was a very good match with a cool swerve ending and Lethal Lockdown continues to be a great match every year.

This is a 1-disc and also has 16 minutes of interviews and the 30-minute Before the Bell special.",1416441600,,714,4.409090909090909
8688391,3,B00PKJYFEI,"The Great Muta, Sanada and Yasu-Kazarian, Daniels and Chris Sabin 6 man tag match was a good match and a good opener. The Samuel Shaw-Mr. Anderson-Escape the Cage match was decent even with the ending. The Tigre Uno-Manik match was not great but pretty good. The Last Man Standing match between James Storm & Gunner was a smash-mouth brawl and a nice one at that. The Madison Rayne-Gail Kim-Women's title match was sloppy at first but managed to still be good at the end. The Magnus-Samoa Joe-World's title match was a solid PPV title bout even with the dumb ending. The Lethal Lockdown match between Team MVP (MVP, Willow, Eddie Edwards & Davey Richards) against Team Dixie (Bobby Roode, Austin Aries, Robbie E & Jesse Godderz) was a hardcore, smash-mouth, fun brawl even though it was predicable in the end. I give this PPV a 6 out of 10.",1416182400,,840,4.644295302013423
8688392,4,B00PKJYFEI,"A couple of notes here in that this years event returned to original format of every match happening inside a steel cage & the international talents from the Wrestle-1 promotion in Japan appeared for the first time to begin a cross promotion with TNA.

Bad Influence & Chris Sabin vs. Great Muta, Senada, Yasufumi Nakanoue - A couple of notes here in that Senada won the X Division Championship a week earlier in Japan (taped for the ""One Night Only: Global Impact - Japan"" event) while this was the first live United States television appearance for the Great Muta since 2000 for World Championship Wrestling.  The Wrestle-1 group showcased the diverse japanese style early in the contest with offense like an abdominal stretch into rolling cradles & Muta showcased this trademark spinning elbow resulting in Bad Influence resorting to illegal tactics to regain the advantage while singling out one member of the other team with double & triple teaming along with various moves from a springboard position as both teams traded momentum with Muta still pulling out offense & tactics that were his trademark throughout his entire career.  A fun opening match.

Xscape Match: Mr. Anderson vs. Samuel Shaw - Christy Hemme wasn't at ringside causing Shaw to threaten suicide off the top of the cage before the match only for Christy to appear in Anderson's corner once Shaw was locked inside the cage as Shaw kept attempting to climb out whenever possible while Anderson was more focused on beating on Shaw using the cage & delivering multiple mic checks before Shaw focused his attention on Christy at ringside in a way that effected everyone.  The match itself wasn't much as it was just a backdrop for what happened with Christy Hemme to further the ""creepy"" storyline.

Bobby Lashley vs. Ethan Carter III - This was originally scheduled to be Kurt Angle but turned out to be an open challenge by EC3 due to Angle's injury in what was only a quick angle for the return of Bobby Lashley as he dominated quickly to the point where EC3 just ran away but it was a strong segment to reestablish Lashley after being absent the last four years and for those trivia fans, it was this same event 5 years ago that he originally debuted for TNA.

Manic vs. Tigre Uno - Both men had stalemates early with their fast paced athletic style executing such moves as a head scissors off a handstand in the corner or a springboard moonsault off the middle rope with the cage playing a factor with them crash & burning into it along with exchanging multiple reversals & counters with diverse aerial & grounded assault that contained various multiple move combinations.  This match reminded of the original days of the X division with both men going an athletic fast paced with diverse wrestling styles.

Last Man Standing Match: Gunner vs. James Storm - Storm debuted a new darker theme song & look with both men starting to brawl against each other outside of the cage on the ramp throughout ringside with bodies being thrown into the guardrail & steps along with the cage door being slammed into one's face as the match finally got inside of the ring where both men continued to deliver impactful offense including a DDT off the top rope & a spear that turned one man inside out while also using whatever they could inside the ring to punish each other more including the cage itself along with the ring ropes & tag rope along with other weapons brought inside the cage such as a steel chair for chairshots & launching into parts of the body or to drive their opponents body onto executing an impactful offense move.  This was the first in a hardcore trilogy of matches between both men (""No DQ/No Count Out"" on Impact & ""I Quit"" at Sacrifice) and set the bar as this was a physical impactful brawl to the point where one man did stand up but neither man was able to do it on their own.

Knockouts Champion Madison Rayne vs. Gail Kim - Gail started off attempting to escape whenever possible only to keep letting stopped by Madison as both girls traded momentum using the cage to their advantage driving each other's head & body into the cage on more than one occasion while each girl continued to take risk that didn't pay off including crashing & burning full speed into the cage while going aerial at one point or another.  Both girl worked hard here with some unique cage spots with Taz saying it perfectly, ""how tough are these girls?""

Submission or Knockout Match: TNA Champion Magnus vs. Samoa Joe - Both men went back & forth early on trading reversals before Joe got the advantage with various strikes focusing on the arm & head using the cage resulting in Magnus bleeding with Joe heavily attacking the cut only for Magnus to retaliate sending Joe headfirst into the cage making him bleed as both men traded momentum exchanging various submission holds with Magnus focusing on the legs & head while Joe continued to work over the arm & later the head himself.  I always said both men had good chemistry together as partners & opponents and this was no exception as they had a very good match here with the only downfall being how the match ended which followed the same trend as majority of main event title matches for the last year to the point where the crowd completely turned on it only to quickly die out & have no reaction.

Lethal Lockdown: M.V.P., The Wolves, Jeff Hardy vs. Bobby Roode, BroMans, Austin Aries - For those who haven't seen a Lethal LockDown match, it's held under the same rules of the old WCW/NWA match of War Games. One man from each team starts the match and after a 3 minute period, another member from one team (which has always been the heel team for those trivia buffs) enters and after each one minute time period, the teams alternate sending members in & once all team members enter the cage, the only way to win is by pinfall or submission while this year featured the return of the roof full of weapons lowered onto the top of the cage.  Various highlights include who were the first two facing off in first period, one man using another as a weapon against his partner, the teamwork between both teams with the various double & triple teaming, ""who"" showed up when Jeff Hardy was banned from the building, various weapons coming into play including stereo Van Terminators using trash cans & a brainbuster onto an open chair & back to back aerial moves involving a trash can & lid, and Dixie Carter's ""insurance policy.""  This Lethal Lockdown was more about brutal weapons shots than previous editions where it was memorable for an over the top high spot but everyone worked hard here & it showed.

This clearly showcased the positive & negatives of the company in that the in-ring wrestling was heavily pushed first before anything else on this card with the different wrestling styles & the international talents only adding to the card with the only real downfalls being their attempts at pushing a storyline & entertainment falling flat (the entire Samuel Shaw story & the finish to Joe vs. Magnus) to the point where it heavily hurt the match more than helped.  In the end, this was one of the best overall TNA PPV events from top to bottom that I would recommend going out of the way to check out.",1415836800,,7231,4.64397496087637
