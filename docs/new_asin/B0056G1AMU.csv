4588228,5,B0056G1AMU,"Bill Moyers has never failed to captivate me, and he does so again in this series. He and Huston Smith validate that the world is too big for just one God. A perfect example of blending the best of all faiths.",1321315200,11,209,4.121951219512195
4588229,4,B0056G1AMU,"No doubt about the upper intellect level of this interview between 2 scholarly men. Moyers asks good questions and the matured Huston Smith, philosophizing comparative religion professor from U of CA, Berkley, is ready with life-long personal indoctrination into the core living religions of the world. The man knows his material, and has spent a good part of his latter years in life trying to assimilate parts of all religions into his own beliefs and practices. However, here he tries to teach, not preach. No religion is attacked or put down. Positive aspects are found and presented from each. It is Smith's desire that the world will come to believe like himself, that all religions have a similar basis, and that all mankind will get along, accepting the religious differences that today, too often, cause conflict.

It is not light entertainment. This is serious discussion, and even Smith admits to a personal struggle from grappling for such a long period with the issues discussed for the interviews that comprise this set of 5 episodes. I found, only one or two episodes per day were practical. Beyond that, it gets a bit heavy and muddled. One needs time to think and mentally respond. That is not a fault of the 2 men, just the significance and depth of the material. Very informative, but not what one would go to for a full understanding of any particular religion.

Smith (with his grandfatherly persona and ""Mr. Rogers"" voice) is a professor/author of philosophy who is sharing his personal philosophy of living relationships and how that is impacted by various religious sect beliefs. He was born into a Christian missionary family, diversified his understanding by deep searches into all major religions, and ultimately remains a Methodist Church attendee, but practicing home prayers, yoga, and dancing from other faiths.
In this DVD series, he avoids religious/faith debate over conflicting differences--avoids theology. Discussion is on society use of religion, not an after-life.

""The real, real gifts, benefits that religion brings is in those moments of choice, day by day, moment by moment. Are we going to opt for the larger life, the more magnanimous, the more courageous life or give in?"" he states.
YES, the DVDs do contain SUBTITLES.
Episodes are: 1-Hinduism & Buddhism; 2-Confucianism; 3-Christianity & Judaism; 4-Islam; 5-A Personal Philosophy (55 minutes each)
Smith talks life, living, and relationships, where religion is one part of life.

A viewers guide includes 6 religions' view of God, 6 `to do' or rule lists, and 5 religions' concepts of service to each other. Ends with religious architecture.
DVDs have text bios of Moyers & Smith plus a `Gallery of Religious Iconography': 7 images with text explanations.",1313366400,31,2754,5.12694877505568
4588230,5,B0056G1AMU,"The 3-part series with Bill Moyers is a glance into one of the most powerful and profound spiritual minds of our time. Everyone should own this series and watch it regularly. It reminds us that there is a transcendent reality, more real than the eat-sleep-go to work world of everyone.

This video series is like an injection of spritual nourishment when you are feeling deprived. Much needed, it will likely inspire you to read Huston's writing and explore the spiritual world at greater depth. It has this effect on me eachand every time I watchi it. Smith is a gift.",1130371200,,569,4.69

8459567,5,B0056G1AMU,I saw this series years ago on public TV.  I always wanted to see it again and be able to digest more of what Mr. Smith had to share.  So happy to have found this at Amazon at such a reasonable price.,1494374400,,200,3.738095238095238
8459568,5,B0056G1AMU,Two erudite individuals share discussions....there is much wisdom to be gained from these two individuals.  Huston Smith died in January 2017 but his life's work will long endure.  Fortunately Bill Moyers is still among us and still occasionally offering his insights on life and the world in which we live.,1486080000,,307,5.12

8459572,4,B0056G1AMU,"Good, but I found it often so general as to lack needed depth when exploring religions.  As an interspiritual Christian,  I feel grateful for Smith and how he has enjoyed his Christian faith, but enjoyed others out of a mature inclusion. This, to me, is more about the amazing journey of Smith in exploring world religions intellectually and practically, than world religions.",1428192000,,376,5.048387096774194

8459575,5,B0056G1AMU,"The inquiring mind of Bill Moyers is at its best in this series on major faiths of the world, done by means of  wonderful interviews with Huston Smith, who has made this broad field of inquiry his lifelong work.  My wife and I loved this series when we saw it for the first time on PBS and we knew we had to migrate to a DVD edition to watch and to revisit in our retirement years.  Faith, in this series, is presented as a fundamental aspect of the human condition.  The approach Huston Smith has followed is non-judgmental and ecumenical.  Smith has found that there are 'true believers' in the Divine everywhere on the globe and the series builds from that premise.  Production and sound are fine and the content deals with the Eternal in a way that will never become 'dated.'

The series comes from Athena, a 'learning' publisher, in a two-disc set that presents five episodes that unroll in some 275 minutes.  It is produced in color and stereo sound and there are subtitles for the hearing impaired.  The set includes a twelve page viewer's guide that very briefly summarizes the series.  The guiding question is 'what is the nature of the divine?'.  Answers are sought by examining Buddhism, a faith with no specific deities, and moves on to discuss Christianity, with its faith organized around one Creator (in three forms).  It then moves on to explore Confucianism from the perspective that its faithful 'buy into' an all-encompassing way of life.  As a contrast, the next program discusses Hinduism, with its large pantheon of Gods and Goddesses, stressing that this multiplicity can also be seen as different iterations of one universal spirit, Brahman the World Soul.  Next up is Islam, with its emphasis on one Creator and the individual's duty to 'surrender' or to follow the one true path as revealed by Jewish prophets, including Jesus of Nazareth, and by Mohammed.  The final section of the series deals with 'the architecture of faith', which is to say it deals with the buildings that the faithful have developed over time as sacred spaces in which to demonstrate their devotion to their faith and its rituals.

For me, all of these topics are important and they are all well done in terms of serious discussion or exposition, aided by visual materials.  This is one of the most important series done in my lifetime for the enlightenment of the faithful of many religions.",1371859200,12,2392,4.766990291262136
