When I purchased my Nikon DSLR camera, I found some of the new concepts quite confusing.
I found this DVD to be a clear and informative guide, introducing me to the camera and basic photography concepts which I had never understood before.
It was perfect for a first-time DSLR user like me.

I uploaded some segments from the DVD.
