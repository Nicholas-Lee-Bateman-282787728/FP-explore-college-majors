The production quality is fantastic, the efforts put into this film are definitely obvious. This is a feature created from the love of this subject.
This makes me love this movie even more.

I have several friends I would like to purchase this for as a gift.

6126683,5,B00H256EAG,"The Bladed Hand is an exploration into the origins and history of Filipino Martial Arts, including the myths and influences that contributed to the art and to Filipino martial culture, including how Filipino Martial Arts have influenced the global martial arts community, Hollywood, and military and police combat tactics far beyond the Philippines' borders. .

The film highlights some disparate origin myths and rivalries of martial culture and many of the individual styles in the Philippines, as well as the efforts to quell the antagonism between schools and styles, and to bring a better understanding of this instrinsic aspect of Filipino culture into the general awareness of the Filipno People, themselves.

The Bladed Hand skilfully approaches the subject of martial culture and history in the Philippines in an academic fashion, seeking to consolidate the truths of the art, creating a interesting and very accessible presentation of Arnis, Eskrima and Kali as they appear in Filipino history, and of the Filipino Martial Arts, today.

Featured in the film are vintage photos and footage of many of the masters of the art, as well as new footage, demonstrations, and discussions with SGM Ciraco Caete, SGM Dionisio Caete, GM Crispulo Atillo, GM Rodel Dagooc, Dan Inosanto, Bobby Tabimina, GM Remy Presas, Jr., Felipe Jocano, Jr., and many other figures that have made Filipino Martial Arts what it is today. .

DVD Special Features include:

- Interview with Lorenz Lasco on ancient Filipino bladed weapons
- Demonstration of Tapado with Master Joe Tan
- Balisong knife demonstration
- Film Outtakes

NOTE: Older DVD players may have an issue with cropping the 16:9 video aspect ratio at the sides, as mine did. But, the aspect ratio appears to be displayed correctly on a computer (tested in VLC).",1386979200,6,1809,5.178082191780822

6126701,5,B00H256EAG,"This is the best documentary on Filipino martial arts. If you are interested in this fighting style, you must watch this documentary.  It is an historical  perspective, albeit brief and focuses primarily on contemporary interests.  My opinion is that this will spawn other documentaries, perhaps with deeper exploration on past history.  It is true that Filipinos have at best, only a vague interest in the past with very little in the way of formal historical records on FMA and, frankly, most of our ancient culture.  I am a proud Filipino and consider this documentary the best presentation on the Filipino people, culture and fighting art.  I only watched the Amazon online documentary and may go ahead and purchase the DVD.  I've told many kababayan to watch this as a way to understand the importance of the FMA for future generations.  For non-Filipinos, I suppose, it is a great introduction to the FMA and for experienced arnis players, would provide them a deeper understanding of the cultural aspects of this form.",1434931200,,1025,4.988235294117647

6126706,5,B00H256EAG,"Even though I may sound bias because I am Filipino, but as you can see, our martial arts is highly effective in real life situations. It is essentially all of the world's best martial arts packed into one. And this IS the reason why it is used in special forces and law enforcement! There were several law enforcers from all over the world who ultimately admitted that Filipino Martial Arts is the best out of all the other martial arts. Bruce Lee was taught how to use the nun chucks by a Filipino name Dan Inosanto, and that weapon is actually what Bruce Lee is REALLY known for! Bruce Lee was also taught how to use dual sticks fighting by Dan as well. The Borne movies, Book of Eli, Resident Evil, Taken movies, etc all of those movies used our martial arts and you can clearly see just how effective it is even though they are just the ""movies."" Those moves that were in those movies, however, were actually used in real life from centuries ago! Hence, special forces and law enforcers use our martial arts! I encourage anyone and everyone (Filipino or not) to learn this system because it helps you not only understand our culture, but how to respect people since it is VERY deadly! You become a human weapon! And as a weapon, you have to respect yourself and the people around you. :)",1423699200,4,1291,4.451476793248945

During a Q&A session with Director Ignacio after the movie, many of those in attendance expressed they were not aware of the importance of Arnis/Kali/Escrima as a national treasure of the Phillippines.  They were moved emotionally and were extremely thankful for Jay's project on the subject of Arnis and all the masters who have worked so hard to preserve these martial arts.

As a practitioner of Modern Arnis / Kombatan, I'm proud to have The Bladed Hand as part of my personal collection and highly encourage anyone from any martial art system to obtain a copy for themselves.  You will not be disappointed!",1410912000,,784,4.82089552238806

6126720,5,B00H256EAG,"I've seen only a few FMA documentaries, but this is by far the best. I thought it was well researched and edited. It reflects how we are as a country and as a culture. They said the best way to preserve a culture is through food. No matter how good it is, unfortunately Filipino food has not gone global. Because it's somewhat a mixture of malay, spanish and chinese influences and lacks identity. FMA on the other hand has its own identity and i am proud of it. It became global because we are a ""giving"" culture. Unfortunately we are not spared of politics, FMA included. I hope the day would come that no matter how we express our ""Kali"" ,we can leave the politics behind, respect each other, train together and promote our art.

6126723,5,B00H256EAG,"Full disclosure: I am the antique weapons collector interviewed in the film.

My quick and dirty review: Excellent narration and script; covered all the key points in Filipino Martial Arts (FMA) both past and present; for Filipinos not familiar with FMA, this will elicit appreciation about their rich martial heritage; flow of storytelling is well done. This is a must see, for those who'd like to know more about FMA, and for every Filipino who'd like to know what the country ""greatest cultural export"" is!",1398643200,2,509,4.988235294117647

6126727,5,B00H256EAG,"Excellent survey of various eskrima styles, staying above the political sensitivities of each school of thought. Wish it was longer! :) Looking forward to the next one!",1393977600,,168,5.2592592592592595
6126728,5,B00H256EAG,"The martial arts of the Philippines have recently come to the forefront through movies (The Bourne Trilogy, Book of Eli, The Hunted) and have fairly recently, certainly within the last century been introduced outside of the Philippines.  Once taught in secret, many times as a ""family"" style, FMA is now inclusive vs. exclusive,  As an archipelago of 7000+ islands, each island and region was able, through trade and interaction with other cultures develop the arts with regional and personal interpretations.  300 years of Spanish colonial rule drove the bladed art underground and transitioned the art from bladed weapons to impact weapons.

Just as then, today there are numerous styles, some personal or familial, some institutional yet while the practitioners were most definitely proud of their background and art, they acknowledge that there is no one correct art, interpretation or style that is better than another.  While conflict certainly existed between styles and practitioners of the same art, this video successfully, in my opinion, remains neutral.

Is it perfect?  No.  As foundation, I think it is an excellent starting point for a person looking into FMA as a martial art to practice.  Historical references and techniques are slowly disappearing with the passing of many practitioners, masters, and grandmasters.

Did it reference every art?  No.  There are as many different styles as there are islands.  I think that, at least with respect to the USA, a follow up video looking at the propagation of FMA through Angel Cabales, Leo Giron, Ramiro Estalilla and many, many, others would be fascinating.  These are grandmasters from the California Central Valley.  But FMA is also on the East Coast of the US (Sayoc Kali, Amante Marinas' Panandata)...FMA is practiced globally.

What Mark Wiley did with books for FMA, I think Jay Ignacio did with video.  Thank you, Jay.

As far as the ""arnis,"" vs ""escrima/eskrima,"" vs. ""kali"" debate on which term is correct...Grandmaster Ramiro Estalill, Jr. D.M.A. (Hon.) has this to say:  Same chicken, different recipe.",1392249600,12,2078,5.242424242424242
6126729,5,B00H256EAG,"Being Filipino, I'm a bit biased.  But The Bladed Hand is a ""must watch"". I've trained in a wide variety arts and found The Bladed Hand both entertaining and informative.

This film does a great job giving historic background and current status of the FMAs. The footage is priceless in showing the speed and fluidity of the Grand Masters at advanced ages.  The video quality is great, but it's hard to absorb the intricacies of the moves because the Grand Masters are so fast...even at 70+ years old.

The story telling held together and I left with a better understanding of the arts. I also walked away with a better appreciation of how the FMAs have been, and must continue to be, an important part of Filipino culture.

If you haven't yet been introduced to FMA, The Bladed Hand will be an eye-opener in terms of both the weapons and empty-handwork. If you have an FMA background, you'll be moved by the humble backgrounds of the Grand Masters. If you're Filipino, you'll walk away proud knowing that we have some of the baddest-ass martial arts in the world :-)

FMA, as presented here is both demystified and celebrated as the greatest, most prolific export of The Philippines, finding a home as part of the training curricula in several of the world's premier military special forces, as well as being used as the basis for the cinematic styles in many of Hollywood's most beloved films.  The subject is brought into historical context, not just for its impact abroad, but in regard to it's many different origins, the maddeningly diverse styles that thrive underneath the broad umbrella term, ""Filipino Martial Arts"", the sometimes friendly, sometimes hateful rivalries that diversity brings, and the somewhat Quixotic efforts to unify them under a national standard.

The most special treat, however, is seeing many of the masters in what turned out to be their final interviews.  Those segments help hammer in the notion that FMA isn't merely a hobby, but a cultural treasure; A vital collection of knowledge and experience that is worth preserving.",1387756800,,1119,5.131868131868132
6126750,5,B00H256EAG,This is an amazing tribute to the lives of men and women who live simple lives while preserving one of the most important (in my opinion) aspects of a nation's culture. Thank you for bringing this to us. I bought one for myself and one to give as a gift.,1387670400,,254,4.1
6126751,5,B00H256EAG,"I remember hearing about this documentary back in 2011, seeing a few way too short trailers and finding myself quite anticipating the release. Various delays meant I would not be able to see this until today (20 December 2013).

20 minutes into my second viewing and it becomes clear that this is far and away the best documentary on FMA out now.

Stop reading reviews and just buy it. And get copies for your friends.",1387497600,,418,4.56

6126754,5,B00H256EAG,"I waited a little over a year to view this documentary, and my excitement was justified after finally viewing this film. I have been a member of the Filipino Martial Arts community for nearly a decade and I must say that this is a great look into the FMA culture. What drew me to this film was that it was from the perspective of someone unfamiliar with Filipino Martial Arts. In my opinion, that unfamiliarity provided an unbiased look into the art. I was really pleased with what I viewed and I know many others will share my thoughts. My only problem was that it left me wanting more, I really hope that there is a follow up to this documentary.

I honestly do recommend this to anyone with an interest in Filipino Martial Arts.",1387238400,,731,4.4148148148148145

8629158,5,B00H256EAG,"There are a few documentaries out on video about the filipino martial arts (FMA) but this one has been the most comprehensive.  It won't show you FMA techniques or dive into any specific details regarding any specific FMA - it just serves as a great summary on the subject.  Having practiced FMA for 4-5 years, I have always wanted to but have never had the opportunity to travel to the Philippines to learn about FMA directly from the source and its culture - this is the closest one can get without traveling and spending a good amount of time there.",1515283200,,552,4.51
