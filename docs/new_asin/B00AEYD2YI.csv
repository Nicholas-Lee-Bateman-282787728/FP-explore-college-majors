8550702,5,B00AEYD2YI,I showed this to my class and they were shocked at how much e-waste we are dumping. It held their attention all the way through.  It has inspired them to be better stewards of our lands and resources.,1474070400,,200,4.2631578947368425

8550704,1,B00AEYD2YI,"This documentary barely scratched the surface of a very important problem and leaves you feeling like crap after!  It basically just says ""there's a problem, it's bad, it's mostly the fault of the US."" It only shows one dump site in Ghana and most of the waste documented looks to be 10-15 years old (I don't think there was a single cell phone shown). There are even more compelling examples in China and other parts of Asia. Watch the Dateline special about ewaste.  In my opinion, this documentary should have included other examples of ewaste dump sites; it should have included a LOT more info about modern facilities that are trying to do this correctly; they should have gone into the economics of ewaste recycling, and what is being done about it; they could highlight companies who have started cradle to grave initiatives; they could talk about pricing electronics to include fees to balance ewaste recycling costs; they should have talked more about what consumers can do--how to find electronic companies with recycling policies, how to find recycling companies that process waste correctly, highlight electronics with a lower impact, how to engage with your representatives in government at the state, federal and county level and what sort of policies and advocacy would help this problem. It's another documentary that just highlights a problem and leaves you feeling hopeless and depressed after.  If you're considering this documentary, then you probably already know that there is a problem. Do yourself a favor and instead of watching this for an hour, research the internet for 30 minutes on local resources that recycle properly, companies with better policies, and your county and states current ewaste policy and any initiatives in which you could engage.",1426550400,,1778,5.124137931034483
8550705,4,B00AEYD2YI,Good information.  Interesting profile of ewaste.  Through no fault of the movie maker info beginning to be a bit dated.,1424390400,,120,4.95
8550706,5,B00AEYD2YI,"A film everyone should see, especially if you have a computer!",1419120000,,62,4.7272727272727275
8550707,5,B00AEYD2YI,"What an amazing work of art-- the filmmakers have perfectly documented the global e-waste situation in a way that is accessible to all. They remind us of how electronics are voraciously consumed and thoughtlessly discarded in the West, but more importantly, they reveal to us where that waste ends up. The reality is shocking and tragic. The environment is not the only victim-- generations of people in developing countries are dying in e-waste cesspools. Terra Blight gives us some hope as well. Recyclers are just beginning to mechanize a system to separate and reuse old electronics. This beautiful and important film is a great first step to getting the word out. Students would especially benefit from seeing it. Not only is it informative, but it's also entertaining and very well edited. See it and you won't walk away unchanged.",1373500800,,837,5.028776978417266
8550708,5,B00AEYD2YI,"I'd recommend this film to every person who has and currently owns any sort of electronic device(i.e. everyone!)
The film offers a glimpse into what effects our consumer driven society has on the third world.",1368144000,,208,4.9714285714285715
8550709,4,B00AEYD2YI,"""Terra Blight"" is a short yet concise documentary about the lifecycle of e-waste. The film takes place between two locations: the USA, where electronics are glorified as a scientific advancement and social pastime and owning at least one is almost mandatory, and Ghana, where computer components are seen as valuable resources to feed one's family or send one's kids to school.  This stark contrast brings to light not only the injustice of the United State's dumping of their waste where it is ""out of sight, out of mind"", but also the large disparity in access to technology amongst various regions of the world. Frequent interviews with environmental journalist, Mike Anane, and a tour of an environmentally responsible American industrial electronics recycler Creative Recycling give some more hope to the situation and show us the direction we need to go in to do justice to the planet and those suffering from poverty.

There were some parts upon which I would have liked expansion, such as the tragedy in Endicott, New York.  I think it's also important to consider how our creation and disposal of electronics affect Americans, too. Overall, I was very pleased with the general overview of this issue, however.  It's a good introduction for those who are unaware of this exploitative practice on developing nations.",1358467200,,1323,5.111111111111111
