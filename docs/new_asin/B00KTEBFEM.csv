6445838,4,B00KTEBFEM,The DVD is a presentation of lessons for the little ones conveyed by likeable if not imperfect characters that learn from their own mistakes subsequently before being potentially committed by the juvenile viewer themselves. Disney needs to release more of these episodes ESPECIALLY the holiday shows which are beautiful examples of diverse celebrations around the world.,1414972800,,370,5.625
