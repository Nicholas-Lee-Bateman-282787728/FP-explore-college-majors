8651704,5,B004BPC0AI,"Great show! Player not only gives great tips, but he's a great story teller. He gives insights on the game, course design and his own life. I taped this when it was televised but that VHS was getting old. It's great to have it on DVD in such great quality. It would be great if the Golf Channel would release the other episodes on DVD. I know they have them as they are available to stream at their website.

This and the other ""Playing Lessons"" programs represent the best that the Golf Channel had to offer. I wished they would bring them back, but I guess reality shows are cheaper to produce.",1352851200,,596,4.321428571428571
