8321080,4,B001MEJY7S,"This is a very interesting DVD if you want to explore the ""raw"" side of the animal world. It certainly has plenty of invigorating moments. There is a sense of adventure that is conveyed through the various scenes, which thrill the mind, arouse the emotions and stir the spirit, as one engages intellectually with the vivid reality of nature's wild, violent and merciless side. I cannot recommend this content to anyone who has any fear of such animal behavior. You will be scared. However, if you like to know more about wild animals, especially the ferocious ones, this DVD will take you on an unforgettable journey into the heart of nature's wildest beasts.",1338940800,3,659,4.84070796460177
