8405229,5,B003TLMQL8,"Not what I expected, but I loved the two-person dialogue. And in many ways I felt someone was holding up a mirror so I was looking back on the many mistakes I have made in my life. The Bozeman MT location reminded me of one of my worst mistakes. If only we could go back and wipe out the most grievous ones, but they are always with you no matter how many start overs you try. Second chances only give you the opportunity not to repeat your past mistakes and to endeavor not to make even bigger ones. There is only one escape from the one life we had messed up.",1483142400,,561,4.063063063063063
8405230,4,B003TLMQL8,"Gen-X version of ""My Dinner With Andre."" Spilling your guts about the problems of life.  I liked it, though not sure why.",1459209600,,121,4.5
8405231,3,B003TLMQL8,"The actors are not first-rate, and some of the mood changes they go through seem forced; you can see the gears grinding in their heads as they ""act"" affronted, or sad.  Nevertheless, there are some good moments if you're in the mood for a contemplative piece of the meaning of life.  Stacey Miller seems implausible as a former cheerleader, and Daniel Rhyder's character background even more so.  This 2009 movie is not to be confused with 2001's Layover, or 2012's Layover, or 2014's Layover.",1400630400,,493,4.845238095238095
8405232,5,B003TLMQL8,"Two people who haven't seen each other since high school get stuck together at an airport until a storm clears, and we follow them from superficial first impressions to alcohol-induced soul barring revelations.  The writing, acting and direction were all really good.  I was thoroughly entertained and moved by the film.  I'd highly recommend it.",1311379200,,346,5.254545454545455
8405233,4,B003TLMQL8,"I enjoyed this film because the acting is excellent, the camera captures the mood and nuances and the body language expressed by both leads is so informative. The ending is charged with emotion. Kudos to April Wright foe excellent direction.",1281139200,,241,5.05
