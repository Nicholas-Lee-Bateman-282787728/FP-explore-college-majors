5407471,4,B00AATGDXO,"I am glad that 2-Entertain has taken to animating a few classic Doctor Who stories because it allows fans of the classic series to still enjoy the stories from the past.  As most classic Doctor Who fans know the BBC wiped many of the the stories from the Hartnell-Troughton years to save money.  All of the audio exists thanks to fans who would plop their cassette recorders in front of the TV each week to to capture the original shows as they aired in the 1960's.  The BBC did not have the same marketing attitude of US TV producers who kept a lot of old TV shows that some of us would like to forget. But it allowed these shows to continue on in syndication for years (and years and years).

The animation here is pretty basic and I think it is done in such a way to reflect the original version in its original concept.  The story is more of an historical drama rather than Sci-Fi. Granted I would prefer if the original 'live' performances still existed but this is a fine substitution.

The DVD includes a ""making of"" documentary like the others.  But we are talking about stories that are about a half-century old so, sadly, many of the original actors and crew behind this story have passed away. So instead of their input you get input from people who are knowledgeable about the inner workings of the BBC from an intelligent point of view rather than hands on.

I am a collector of these DVD's so this is a great addition to my collection.  But for the average person this might be a little slow to watch.",1362182400,8,1515,4.382142857142857
5407472,4,B00AATGDXO,"""The Reign of Terror"" is...pretty good Doctor Who. The plot in a nutshell: the Doctor and his companions land in the French countryside during Robespierre's little heyday, and get caught up in various plots, intrigues, and generally violent events. Typical of the William Hartnell era, the story features no science fiction elements apart from the Doctor himself, which is a formula that I really like.

But alas, the narrative is too repetitive: the good guys are frequently captured and locked up, only to escape, and then get captured and locked up again. Also, the production's low-budget nature shows through too often, even for a seasoned viewer of cheese like myself. The (very few) sets have a flat, two-dimensional quality (check out those painted ""stone"" walls!), and there aren't nearly enough extras to convince me that I'm looking at ""Paris.""

On the other hand, Hartnell gives one of his most charming performances as the Doctor here. (I simply love the part where he's forced to join a road gang.) Also, Jacqueline Hill has some great moments as Barbara; as the ""moral compass"" of the heroes, she gets to make an obvious-but-good speech railing against the violence of both the Revolution and its opponents. In short, some nice character moments help to elevate a slightly uninspired story.

As for the DVD itself, its most notable feature is that two missing episodes -- which exist only in audio form -- have been animated here. So, you get to watch cartoons of the original actors combined with the surviving audio. While I liked the animated episodes, I found them somewhat jarring, because they look new / shiny whereas the original episodes look, well, ancient. Also, the quality of the animation is a tad static. However, the animated characters look very much like their real-life counterparts, and the backgrounds are very detailed, so overall I'm impressed with the quality of the work done here.

Another notable feature is the DVD's interesting ""making of"" special, which explores the serial's troubled production history. (There was considerable friction between Hartnell and the director.) Rounding out the features is a commentary featuring a diverse sampling of the cast and crew. It's definitely a nice DVD package -- not the best that the Doctor Who range has to offer, but still very cool and miles ahead of most TV DVDs. Given the modest price tag, I definitely think it's worth picking this one up.",1361664000,2,2434,5.017326732673268

5407474,2,B00AATGDXO,"Stiff and boring talking heads.  It drained every bit of the life out of an already tedious story.  They'll have to do better than this if animation is going to be the way they handle stories with missing episodes.

5407475,4,B00AATGDXO,"Doctor Who joins the French revolution in this six part story that closed the first season of the programme back in 1964. Since then, episodes 4 & 5 have been wiped, but thanks to some industrious fans, the soundtracks survived and BBC Video have now made an attempt at restoring the missing episodes using animation. They did it before with two episodes of The Invasion, the later Patrick Troughton story from 1968. That worked really well, but I'm not sure this attempt is quite so successful. It's a different animation studio involved in this recreation and the style is very unlike the earlier work. At first watch, you'd have to guess that the animators haven't seen the existing episodes or indeed, might never have seen Doctor Who from this era ever before; both inconceivable conclusions. The show was made with rarely more than four cameras, with two cameras being used (generally) to record each scene. The animation is cut very quickly and jumps from close up to long shot, to two shot, to background; very rapidly, in a style of TV direction that didn't come about until decades later. It's something that just wouldn't have been possible. Therefore, rather than recreate the episodes to blend in with the surviving material, they've created something very different; and it jars. Plus, the animators have made a really big effort to detail the characters faces and even though it's all in black and white, they've tried to give shading and highlights to everything. That doesn't work either. You end up with multi-greyed faces, hair, eyes, etc that just look like a painting by numbers experiment. They've tried really hard to put fantastic detail into the backgrounds and scenes (including dust floating in shafts of light, spiders running across webs, candles flickering) and they've (perhaps excessively) animated every characters eyeballs. Alas, they're using the same eyeballs for every character; and they're too big for the heads, so all this work and detail is distracting. Regardless, it's a really brave attempt to restore the programme in a very unique way; but lower your expectations if you're looking for something akin to the quality of The Invasion. That project is considerably superior. In addition to the animation, there's a very good documentary about the making of the programme and there's a commentary for episodes 1, 2, 3 & 6 featuring Carole Ann Ford, Timothy Combe and a number of minor cast members. It's a shame the only other survivor of the original TARDIS crew, William Russell wasn't included; especially as this is the last of his stories to reach DVD. There's no commentary for the animated episodes. Instead, there's an interview with Ronald Pickup (who has a very small part and is unrecognisable in his animated form) layed over episode 4 and interviews with two fans who've helped track down missing episodes for part 5. There are no production notes on screen for the animated episodes either. That's very disappointing. As always, the production notes provide a really fascinating back story to the making of the show and (again, as always) contradict a lot of what is being said. The commentators continually mention how director Henric Hirsch never worked for the BBC ever again, whilst the production notes on screen list his later BBC credits. Quite funny really. We've still got the animated versions of The Ice Warriors, The Underwater Mennace, The Moonbase and The Tenth Planet being released, but it looks like we won't be seeing the earlier studio's work again. It's a good idea and it's great to have it, but it could clearly have been done better. Maybe they're saving that for the inevitable Reign Of Terror Special Edition.",1360800000,,3691,4.9935064935064934

5407477,5,B00AATGDXO,"I love this 6 part story because it is just history and not Sci-Fi. When Doctor Who started it was an educational program!! The Doctor and companions traveled back in time as a fun way for kids to learn and see historical events ie.: The Aztecs, the rein of terror in France, Marco Polo (which I hope will be next to be animated.) King Richard The Lion Hearted ect. ect., also to teach them a bit about science too which is why Willian Hartnel often times sounds like a college professor. This all stopped with the Second Doctor Patrick Troughton I believe The Highlanders where we meet long running companion Jammie McCrimmon was the last straight historic story with no aliens or monsters.

As for the BBC having found the original audio tracks for the 2 missing episodes (4. The Tyrant of France and 5. A Bargain of Necessity) it's thanks to kids who recorded the audio on reel to reels and the new cassette tapes that we have the audio. On of the bonus features for the Partick Troughton story The Invasion (The first Doctor Who to have animated episodes filling in the missing ones) goes into details about how they cleaned up and spliced together different audio sources to get the best quality they could. If you get the missing episodes cd set these home made recordings are the soundtrack you're listening too same with the loose cannon reconstructions

I say a giant three cheers to the BBC for working hard to satisfy the fans and get these lost storylines to us devoted fans I can't wait for more in the future!",1357257600,18,1523,4.554744525547445
5407478,4,B00AATGDXO,"The Doctor is trying to land in present-day England (1964), in another attempt to take Barbara and Ian home. Unfortunately, the TARDIS ends up in the French countryside. More to the point, it is 1794 France. The French Revolution is five years old and Madame Guillotine reigns.

In spite of finding period clothing to change into (Ian comments on Barbara's transformation with, ""Hairstyle's a bit modern, but it's all right.""), it doesn't take them long to get into trouble. Susan, Ian and Barbara find themselves arrested and taken to Paris, and the infamous Conciergerie Prison, to await their execution. They're told, ""You will be guillotined as soon as it can be arranged."" [Historical note: This is due to a new law that gives the authorities the right to execute not only without a trial, but based on suspicion only.]

The Doctor, fortunately, was separated from the trio and not arrested. He takes off down the road to Paris to rescue them. He meets a forced gang road work crew, and because the Doctor can't keep his mouth shut, he ends up being pressed into labor himself.

Fortunately, our travelers, in more than one place, stumble onto an escape chain. But it is not that easy to get anyone out of Paris, even with the chaos that is still France, and it will be a close shave (heh heh). Spies and turncoats from both sides operate on secrecy and paranoia. But how often do you get to meet a world figure such as Napoleon?

This is a review of the January 2013 1-disc DVD release of ""The Reign of Terror"", the first time the full serial has been released on DVD. It was considered a ""lost serial"" until the 1980's when copies of the video for episodes 1, 2, 3 and 6 were recovered from stations in Malta and Cyprus and a private collector. A VHS was released in 2003 with narration by Carole Ford (who plays Susan) linking episodes 3 and 6.

For this DVD release, however, the BBC is including animated versions of episodes 4 & 5. They did recover the full original audio of episodes 4 & 5, so the animation will be matched with the original voices of William Hartnell, et al. As Toby Hadoke says, in the Commentary: ""A doughty fan with a microphone next to their telly recorded the sound track.""

[Added after I received and watched the DVD:] I was pleasantly surprised by the two animated episodes. The animation is grayscale; I've added a still to this page as a Customer Image to give you an idea of how it looks. If you aren't going to go to the expense to get Disney-quality animation, then this grayscale animation is an elegant solution. It rather looks like a modern graphic novel. In particular, look at the characters' eyes. Whoever animated the eyes is a genius. Susan occasionally looks like a scarecrow and the Doctor like a wrinkled apple, but overall, I thought it was a decent effort. The sound on the two animated sequences still has a bit of the microphone recorded sound to it, and I had to turn up the volume a bit, but, overall, it wasn't a problem for me.

This is a decent episode of Dr. Who, which originally aired in August/September 1964. The show has six 25-minute episodes. I take a star off because there isn't much science fiction in the tale. This is just my opinion - it's a historical show and has nice twists and turns to the plot, but it's still not science fiction and the driving force behind the plot is that it is an escape thriller. The only science-fiction-y moment is when Barbara says that she learned her lesson about trying to change the future in ""The Aztecs"".

But there is a lot to like about ""Reign of Terror"". The sets are great and the atmosphere appropriately tense. There is some nice acting, and I particularly got a kick out of the jailer, a sodden bully who's alternately servile. He's humorous without meaning to be.

The attention to historical detail seems very good. For example, when Robespierre is arrested, he holds a hand over the lower part of his face. In real life, Robespierre unsuccessfully attempted to kill himself before capture, by shooting himself through the jaw (some believe he was shot by one of his captors). On the other hand, as revealed in the Info Text, Extra #6, the Secretary of the Napoleon I Society wrote a letter to the BBC stating that ""Today's episode [#6] was, factually speaking, nonsense.""

One thing I noticed is that I am not fond of this series' incidental music. That's a surprise for me, because usually I don't even notice the incidental music.

Extras on the DVD:
** Commentary on all six episodes, which I found great fun to listen to. It is found under the Audio Options Extra #5, but I wanted to describe it first. Moderated by Toby Hadoke, who is, once again, a fan extraordinaire with many facts at his fingertips. Commentators include Carole Ann Ford (plays Susan), Neville Smith (plays D'Argenson, the blonde panicky escapee at the farmhouse), Jeffry Wickham (plays Webster, Ian's English cellmate, who promptly dies), Caroline Hunt (plays Danielle, living at the safe house, her 1st job straight out of drama school), Patrick Marley (soldier on the left arresting Robespierre), Timothy Coombe (his first job after being promoted to production assistant) and Ronald Pickup (the physician who betrays Susan and Barbara, in his very first job on TV). In addition, Paul Vanezis and Philip Morris talk about the search for the missing episodes.
The commentary for the two animated episodes was recorded before the animation was completed, but the commentators did have the audio and photos to go by.
The commentators have a lot of fun together. Jeffry Wickam, for example, appears in only one episode, ever, of Doctor Who, and he's flat on his back dying in short order. Yet, ""It absolutely amazes me that I quite often get people saying how enormously they admire my artistry as Webster.""
In 1981, Dr. Who Magazine published a list of lost episodes. On his own, Paul Vanezis ""started writing letters to television stations all over the world, hoping that some episodes might turn up."" Though we may be unhappy with BBC's decision to destroy old footage, Phillip Morris reminds us that ""General Hindsight never won a war.""
Last but not least, at one point, Hadoke says to Neville Smith, ""You're about to get rhubarbed to death.""  You have to listen to the commentary to find out what he was talking about!
[If you're interested, the sfx.co.uk website has an April, 2012, article that I found fun and interesting. It's about how some recent commentaries have been recorded for Doctor Who, including photos of studio sessions. You can find it by googling ""Doctor Who: Recording The DVD Commentaries"".]
1. ""Don't Lose Your Head - The Making of the Reign of Terror"" (25 minutes) Commentators are Carole Ann Ford, William Russell (plays Ian) and Timothy Combe. The filming had some low points, some of which can be summed up as The Curse of Lime Grove Studios. The studio was very cramped and very hot. So hot that a couple times the sprinklers came on in the middle of filming. The odd oblong shape made set design as well as camera placement difficult.
2. ""Robespierre's Domain: Animated Backgrounds Tour"" (4 minutes) While listening to audio from the show of action that takes place in the animated episodes 4 & 5, you are shown the animated backgrounds before the animated characters were added. All in black & white, of course, and quite atmospheric.
3. ""The Reign of Terror - Photo Gallery"" (4 minutes) A variety of stills are shown. There are color photos from rehearsals, and black & white stills from the show and as well as the empty sets. It's all accompanied by a rousing rendition of La Marseillaise.
4. ""The Reign of Terror - Animation Gallery"" (4 minutes) I found this very intersting. There are character studies, as a painter might make, with an actor's face from different angles. There are examples of where the animator started from a photo of an actor and then translated it into animation. There are examples where the animation started with a line drawing of the actor, and then filled out into the full animation.
5. Audio Options:
...A) Feature Audio (ie. regular viewing)
...B) Commentary
6. Production Info Text. This can be viewed only on the four non-animated episodes. Reviewers don't often mention the Info Text. Am I the only one who enjoys it? For example, at the beginning of episode 1 of ""Reign of Terror"", we see the ""first ever on-screen materialisation [British spelling] of the full-sized police box prop"". I liked the details on the differences between filming TV in the 60's, versus today. Some mechanical/actor/continuity/costume bloopers are mentioned, as well as historical tidbits: ""Nearly three quarters of those condemned by the revolutionary tribunals were workers and peasants"".  And how about clothes hangers? When were they invented?
Director Henric Hirsch is mentioned many times in the commentary and other extras. He collapsed on the set, from nervous exhaustion, for a couple reasons combined. In the other extras, the unfortunate common view seems to be that ""Reign of Terror"" ruined Hirsch for any more BBC jobs. In the Info Text, however, it says that Hirsch went on to direct five other dramas for BBC.

The Doctor and his companions (including granddaughter Susan) are soon caught up in the political intrigues of Citizen Robespierre's worst days (which naturally involves a lot of prison time for the characters).

The story is interesting with the usual turns of luck for the Doctor and his friends. The nice blend of humor and drama is kept up, with Hartnell being especially silly in his period costume. They even manage to have one or two thoughtful conversations about both sides of the French Revolution and England's role during it. The original broadcast was in six episodes, though the videos for episodes four and five are lost. The audio still exists and some rough animations have filled in.

5407500,2,B00AATGDXO,"""The Reign of Terror"" was a grim story--the last of the show's first season--produced under equally grueling conditions at the BBC's medieval Lime Grove, a long but narrow film studio dating back to the silent era that forced the crew to re-create the French Revolution mostly from inside a small section of La Conciergerie prison and along a narrow Parisian street with only a minimal cast. No crowd of 3,000 extras cheers public executions at the guillotine, because there simply wasn't the budget.

Instead, a couple of fleeing royalists are shot down in cold blood, the Doctor is almost burned alive in a barn, and later he brutally clubs a captor over the head with a shovel. Susan spends most of the story screaming in terror, delirious with a mysterious fever or cringing from rats. This was children's television in the mid-1960s? No wonder the director, Henric Hirsch, collapsed from sheer exhaustion during the taping of Episode 3.

If the viewer can endure the gritty first half, ""The Reign of Terror"" brightens considerably by Episode 4, when the production moved to the more modern and better-ventilated BBC Television Centre. The Doctor colorfully disguises himself as a high official in the Revolution in hopes of finding his friends, and an element of espionage is introduced into the story as Ian promises a dying prisoner to track down a British agent and help him escape the country with vital information about the French.

Director Hirsch, a plucky Hungarian who survived the 1956 revolt, recovered and managed to finish the six-episode sequence, with help from production assistant Tim Combe and greater sympathy from demanding actor William Hartnell as the Doctor. Meanwhile, the very future of Doctor Who as a series, destined to last five more decades (minus a few years of hiatus), was being negotiated behind the scenes at this time by producer Verity Lambert and BBC One Controller Donald Baverstock.

Lost Episodes 4 and 5 have been restored on this disc in stunning animation that accurately re-creates the show's sets and actors in an artfully shaded black-and-white that captures the stark lighting of the production better than the original videotape. This DVD comes with the usually competent 25-minute making-of documentary and a walkthrough of the animated sets, but no further explanation is offered of the truly herculean feat that's accomplished on this disc: the animated restoration.

The First Doctor will always have a spot in my heart, because he set the standard for the show and all that would come after him.

5407507,5,B00AATGDXO,"I have watched Doctor Who for years and while in High School my public television re ran every episode of the original series from start to finish. At the time I really enjoyed the First Doctor and especially the second -  I hated that thier were missing  episodes and read every Target novelization I could get my hands on. Reign of terror was not one. So When I got to see this it was such a joy to finally see some ""new"" classic Doctor Who. What I was not expecting was how well the animated reconstruction of the missing parts was done. I really hope they continue this trend and can fill in more of the missing shows in a similar fashion.",1366675200,2,643,4.262295081967213

5407509,5,B00AATGDXO,"A Doctor 1 story that few have seen before, this was a very enjoyable adventure with the Doctor and his companions dashing about in revolutionary France.

5407511,4,B00AATGDXO,"I have been wanting to see this missing story from the 1st Doctor for a number of years.  The acting was very well done and the extras on this production are excellent.  The animation for the mission episides is also first rate.  I am glad the diaglog was intact, as this made the animation more real.  As one of the purely historical stories, this joins the Aztecs and the Romans in my collection.  The only reason I did not give this five stars is that I am still disappointed that no one has come up with the missing episodes.  The plan to provide all the Doctor stories on DVD is a worthy goal.  I think now have almost everything that is out there, except Shada, which I am contemplating acquiring.",1363910400,,703,4.361538461538461

5407513,3,B00AATGDXO,I might not have bought this save for the animated episodes.  I'd like to see other DW serials animated to complete them (one even hopes someday this will be done for serials with little to no episodes left).  This is a good story but far from one of my favorites.  The animation is well done even if the animators make things more lively than the very studio bound episodes were.  I'm waiting for The Tenth Planet and The Ice Warriors to be done this way.,1363392000,,456,4.329411764705882
5407514,5,B00AATGDXO,I admit it.  I love Doctor Who!  It saddens me to no end to know that the BBC destroyed so many of the classic B&W Hartnell and Troughton episodes.  This serial was great and I hope that the restoration team kicks it into high gear and animates more of the lost ones.,1363305600,,267,4.096153846153846
5407515,5,B00AATGDXO,"Thanks to Amazon, another Dr. WHO has made it to the public. With the animated portions, in combination with the surviving footage, it proved good viewing and worth the wait. I'll be waiting for those episodes that remain to be releases.",1363219200,,237,4.804878048780488
5407516,3,B00AATGDXO,Finally got around to watching the entire story.  The story is average but I do have a huge gripe with the animation.  I applaud the effort in doing this but they maybe tried too hard.  Too many quick edits with too many up close shots and it hurts the eyes because of all the edits.  Every shot lasts maybe at most 2 or 3 seconds then BAM another close up or different angle.  I've lost count at how many cut edits there are in 30 seconds let alone a full animated episode.  Plus they seem centered on just pure close ups on facial features which are overdone.  They look in reality....creepy.  However I do like the fact that they did keep the animation to a black and white type feature.,1363132800,4,690,4.253846153846154
5407517,5,B00AATGDXO,Two of  the six episodes are animated with original (I think) sound track.  William Hartnell' costume is something to behold!,1362441600,,125,5.2
5407518,4,B00AATGDXO,"A fun time-travelling adventure set in France at the time of the French Revolution, seeing some of the key characters brought to life in interaction with our Doctor Who regulars.

This story has one main thing to commend it: It has never been released on video' before. The reason for this is that two episodes were missing from the archive. Thus, all Doctor Who fans had were croaky old fifth generation pirate copies and soundtrack recordings. Now, with the help of some lacklustre animation, the full six parts have been restored for your viewing pleasure.

Dennis Spooner's story isn't one of his greatest, but it's reasonable. There are little educational bits about the French Revolution thrown in, which I quite enjoyed. It does seem rather slow-moving, but more than that, it's repetitive, with people in and out of prison. The realisationm however, is pretty good. Despite beginning the story in the cramped Lime Grove studios, Director Henric Hirsch manages to pull off a stylish and convincing production. The costumes are superb, particularly the outfit William Hartnell's first Doctor is shown wearing on the cover of the DVD. Likewise the sets are exemplary, and not for one moment do you think you are not in France. The regulars are on good form, particularly Hartnell, who delights in his temporary costume change and the chance it gives him to play an authority figure.

The two animated episodes try hard, but despite some wonderful drawings of sets and good character artwork, the actual movements are poor and this is compounded by a distracting ""morphing"" effect used in facial expressions. Thankfully, it's only two episodes, and then we are back to reality.

The extras are great, with a feature about the making of the programme showing just how difficult it was for poor old Henric Hirsch (so much so that he had a breakdown). The commentary is reasonably good, with Carole Ann Ford and Tim Combe being moderated by Toby Hadoke, then for the animated episodes there is a rather odd commentary track, bearing no relation to the visuals. This is Paul Vanezis telling the story of the missing episodes and how some were recovered. This gives him a chance to set the record straight (there's a bit of Ian Levine myth-making in there!). While this is a tale worth telling, it doesn't belong on a commentary track, and really the disc should have had something like The Invasion, where the stars could watch animated versions of themselves and still give a meaningful commentary on the action of the episode.

Not one of the best, but hey, it's Doctor Who, it's enjoyable, and it's William Hartnell, so four stars :-)",1362355200,,2637,4.903587443946188

No sci fi at all, i.e. not one monster, alien, creature, computer, time travel issue, science, etc.  My advice: don't waste your money since there are piles of other good Dr Who to buy/watch.
