1405722,5,B000059HHC,"This is a great Aussie movie. I saw it for the first time in Australia and am glad that it's finally available in America. It won't change your life, but if you're going to watch a movie - you'll probably enjoy this one. It's about growing up - doing the right thing and taking care of the people you love. If you liked Coyote Ugly, you'll like this movie. Also of note, this movie and the director inspired the workmen tap sequence during the opening of the Sydney 2000 Olympic games.",983232000,5,485,4.34065934065934
1405786,3,B000059HHC,"Probably would've given it 2 stars because the general plot and acting was a bit hokey. But, appreciating the entertainment value and talent of the tap dog style allowed me to watch the whole movie. Otherwise, I would've probably just turned it off and giving it 2 stars which to me is barely entertaining, with one star being awful and not worth any amount of $",1437782400,,362,4.5

1405838,4,B000059HHC,"Bootmen lived up to it's promise.  A great storyline without the Hollywood glitz. Enjoyed the movie and the tappin.  I would order from this provider again.

1405841,4,B000059HHC,"Probably not fair for me to review any dancing movies.  I love most of them and I loved this one.  Regretted
that there had to be a bad boy in the story, but the dancing is awesome.",1319241600,,181,3.864864864864865
1405842,4,B000059HHC,"""Bootmen"" stars Adam Garcia (Coyote Ugly) and Sam Worthington (Terminator Salvation; Avatar; Clash of the Titans.) Worthington's role is major, but it is supportive rather then starring. His acting is typical Sam Worthington except, since this movie was filmed in his native Australia, you get to hear his Australian accent rather than his West Coast American Acting accent. Even though this movie is about tap dancing, and Adam Garcia is in his element, don't expect to see much dancing from Sam. Any dancing Sam does is in the back ground, off camera, and short lived. Because of the story line, Sam is not in the finale.",1268179200,,623,4.886792452830188
1405843,4,B000059HHC,"""Bootmen"" tells the story of two brothers(Sam Worthington and Adam Garcia)with two very different dreams. The tap choreography is original and nicely done. If you liked ""Footloose"",you'll love ""Bootmen""!",1247184000,,203,6.0344827586206895

1405898,5,B000059HHC,"At first the story is a little slow, the story of two sons and a Father. Of course there's always one son who wants to make it on his own instead of going into the family business.  He's interested in tap dancing.  Anyway, the brothers both like the same girl. The girl gets pregnant....  The tapdancer decides to make a show with his buddies and he invents these metal plates to put on his shoes, they're not taps.  Anyway, I liked it!  There was music and tapdancing metal sounds.  If you like music and a little drama..it's perfect for you.",1168300800,,543,4.38
1405899,4,B000059HHC,"I first seen the movie when it was shown on cable. I only caught the last 30min. of the show and really liked it! I new then I had to have it! since

1405923,5,B000059HHC,"Recently became a fan of Adam Garcia after seeing him in Riding in Cars with Boys and Coyote Ugly.  So I looked this video up.  This is really the best.  He's the lead obviously and the viewers get a chance to see him do his thing and dance like crazy.  My sons watched it and now they are going to take tap this fall.  Something I wanted to do.  I thought it was great.  The critics probably hated it.  They hate his newest release the 1st 20 million is always the easiest, but they shouldn't forget that the writing plays a significant part in the success of the movie. For his part Adam is a total success.",1027468800,3,609,4.145299145299146
1405924,5,B000059HHC,"Five days ago I had never even heard of Adam Garcia and now I am looking everywhere for his work.  I saw him in Coyote Ugly and decided I wanted to see more of what he's done.  I ordered this movie and it arrived three days later!  I just watched it.  While the story line was nothing new or novel, it was a solid plot with good acting.  But, the dancing -- absolutely incredible.  What a fantastic dancer Adam Garcia is!  I wish I had been able to see him in Saturday Night Fever -- I bought the CD this week and love it and highly recommend that.  I think this young man has success written all over him.  Also highly recommend Riding in Cars With Boys.  Excellent movie.",1022716800,2,673,4.147286821705427
1405925,5,B000059HHC,"I was standing in line at the video store waiting to check out, when I glanced to the new release wall and this one jumped out at me.  I was already a fan of Adam Garcia from ""Coyote Ugly"", so I read the back, thought it sounded interesting, and decided to rent it.  I was so pleased!  It's a great movie, full of romance, drama, and lots of great tap dancing.  Think ""The Full Monty"" meets ""Stomp"" and you have ""Bootmen.""  I highly recommend this movie - it's worth it!

1405926,5,B000059HHC,"When I first watched this movie, I must confess that I only was interested because Adam Garcia (total hunk) was starring in it.  But to my surprise, this movie has a great story to it.  I found myself not watching it because of Garcia, but because I was really interested in the story line.  The dancing in this movie is so amazing - it must have taken these guys months to learn those moves!  It really is a great movie so don't listen to all those critics who ""hated it"" - go out and rent this movie.  Trust me - you'll want it as part of your movie collection!",1007510400,4,563,4.128440366972477
1405927,5,B000059HHC,"While I was waiting for this movie to arrive, I searched out comments from the critics.  Sadly, I didn't find a lot of glowing reviews.  Most were downright tepid.  But I don't know why ... I found it  an excellent movie that I've already watched again several times.  I expected to like it simply because hot Aussie hunk Adam Garcia is in it.  That was great to be sure.  But the movie itself was really good in my opinion.  Getting to see Adam dance is just the icing on the cake.  A good story, a hot guy, and some great dancing.  This ain't your grandmother's tap ... Bootmen rocks!",1004486400,8,586,4.293577981651376
1405928,4,B000059HHC,"Dein Perry's Aussie stage sensation ""Tap Dogs"" is the basis for this frenzied, feel-good dance musical about a young Aussie steel worker who creates an industrial strength tap show to raise money for a very worthy cause. Yes, the plot is old hat. So are the characters, the subplots, the conflicts and the happy ending. But so what. This isn't David Mamet or Arthur Miller. And that's o.k. It's ""The Full Monty,"" ""Summer Stock,"" ""Andy Hardy"" and ""Billy Elliott"" revisited. You also get handsome faces, sweaty bodies, pretty girls, orange sunsets, crashing waves, a pumped-up score and a great performance by screen newcomer Adam Garcia. In case you've forgotten, Garcia created the role of Tony Manero in the London stage version of ""Saturday Night Fever."" He was sensational. Here, he dances on steel beams, pipes and metal floors while Perry turns up the heat using some of this famous ""Tap Dogs"" routines. When not dancing, Garcia displays his ""let's put on a show"" persona matter-of-factly, making you cheer him on his his quest to prove to his fellow Aussies that if you want something hard enough, it will come true.  If you want escapism, you'll find it here. You'll also succumb to Garcia's charms in much the same manner as those lucky enough to catch him live in ""London's West End. Following the film, watch ""Tap Dogs."" That's also available on DVD and VHS.",989798400,8,1368,4.846153846153846
1405929,4,B000059HHC,"You know...when i saw the cover of this video the first thing i thought of was TapDogs.  Im a dancer, and i know the Original Australian cast, and the 1st American Cast (while it was on broadway).  I know the people that were in the show.  Anyway, That was my whole reason for renting it.  I didn't read the back and didn't realize it was all from dein perry.  Then as i was watching it...i got really really upset that they ripped off the whole idea of Tap Dogs.
Anyway, needless to say i now know that it was meant to be like that.  The movie was great, that tapping was awesome.  My only wish is that they left the love story out.  Dein Perry is all about Tapping and thats what this movie should have been.",989107200,,710,4.131386861313868
