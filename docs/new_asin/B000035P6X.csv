1258184,4,B000035P6X,"Gary, Ind. born William Marshall adds real pathos to the perennial movie villain of the vampire-- dumbed down and familar ever since Bela Lugosi, Marshall made him aristocratic on a level comparable to Christopher Lee's Dracula in the Hammer Films..  There is much political allegory to be seen in this film, as the black monarch is attacked and 'enslaved' by European vampire-colonialism, and subsequently, becomes as obsessed with blood-lust as they are-- feeding on his own people and perpetuating a bizarre form of genocide-- much to the chagrin of his contemporaries in Watts. Mamuwalde is aware of what he has become, and hates it-- but, seemingly, can do nothing about it-- is the curse of racism, essentially, too great to overcome?",988848000,,740,5.115702479338843
1258185,4,B000035P6X,"Blacula (William Crain, 1972)

How many wonderfully bad films did Sam Arkoff give the public? (According to IMDB, a hundred thirty-nine.) This one was right smack dab in the middle, the first big-screen feature for a rising star named William Crain, who went on to be a big name in TV episode directing (The Dukes of Hazzard, Starsky and Hutch, et al.). How wrong can you go with a film whose trailer excalimed ""he's Dracula's soul brother!""?

Not too far, as it turns out. This is a wild and wonderful piece of pure camp. An African prince, Mawatunde (William Marshall) and his wife Luva (Vonetta McGee) are sent to Europe in 1780 to protest the slave trade, and they appeal to a certain count in transylvania. Mawatunde gets offended when Dracula lusts after his wife publicly and... well, you can guess the rest of that part. Mawatunde is awakened almost two hundred years later after he's been transported to LA by a couple of ultra-hep antiques dealers, where-- surprise of surprises-- he comes across the reincarnation of his wife!

Priceless stuff. You can't make comedy this funny. *** 1/2",987379200,2,1097,4.7936507936507935
1258186,1,B000035P6X,"Being the curious movie buff cracker that I am, I recently decided to take my first trek into the weird wide world of black exploitation movies. But instead of choosing one of the more obvious flicks to commence my ""soul cinema"" experience, like ""Shaft"" or ""Superfly"", I wanted to start with something a bit more offbeat. ""Blacula"" became that choice. It would turn out to be an unfortunate decision, one that almost turned me away- screaming and running at a fast clip- from the genre, perhaps never to return. In the least, I was hoping that it would have a so-bad-it's-good quality to it... no such luck. It was just plain BAD bad. I was unable to endure more than the first 45 minutes before rewinding the tape and bringing it back to the local video store... a mere two hours after I checked it out! It still remains my personal record for the shortest amount of time I've held onto a video rental. This from someone who usually waits 'til the last possible minute to return his rentals before the late charges kick in.
However, despite my less-than-stellar first impression with the genre, I'm happy to report that my curiosity for the blaxploitation market hasn't been fully extinguished. I've got ""The Thing With Two Heads"" cued up, and so far I'm enjoying the show. Who knew Ray Milland and Roosevelt Grier had such a great on-screen chemistry? Yeah, yeah... I know most of you consider it to be only quasi-B.E., but it's a start...

1258209,4,B000035P6X,"This movie must be consumed knowing that it's a low budget ""B"" movie with high exploitation (""blacksploitation"") aspirations.

This movie was a real treat for African Americans to see in it's day because its taken the European Dracula love story and put a twist on it with a creative story line.  Where this movie fails is the dated and sometimes off putting dialogue, lighting, and weird camera angles.  It's pretty bad and to be honest, these are the toughest areas for ""B"" movies to excel in.  The make-up effects were especially bad, but to be completely fair, all of the Dracula / vampire movies at the time were done with the same kind of terrible make-up which means that filmmakers have learned better make-up techniques over the years to our benefit.

With all of it's flaws, still adore this movie for it's romantic story.  I always leave this movie wishing there was a longer and more gradual romantic seduction between Blacula and his lady since that was the main point of the story.

The acting is great especially on the part of William Marshall who plays the title role.  He is excellent.  The supporting cast is pretty good as well, but Thalmus Rasulala stands out as the doctor trying to solve Blacula's string of murders.",1452124800,,1239,4.725581395348837
1258210,3,B000035P6X,"I vaccilated on rating this movie.  On one hand, it's a pretty bad example of the ""Blaxplotation"" films of the 80's, on the other it's a definite twist on the Dracula films of which I think 6 came out the same year as this one.

Viewed from today's perspective,I found some of the dialogue rascist and offensive, though in context it was supposed to be sarcastically funny (I think), which sopiled the enjoyment of the film. The story itself is nothing new. Prince Mamuwalde andhis wife are sent to Transylvania to negotiate a treaty with Dracula and others. Dracula laughs at his petition to abolish slavery, bites the prince and locks his wife in a dungeon with the newly vampirized Mamuwalde. Centuries later, his coffin and the Dracula inventory is purchased by decorators who take it to the States where the prince rises, discovers the double to his beloved wife and mayhem ensues, etc.

Aside from gaping at the fashions of that era, I found neither script nor acting anything to rave about. Wiliiam Marshall's declamation in that mellifluous Shakesperean voice was about the only thing recommending it. He was wasted in this film. Box office receipts must have been good because there was at least one sequel afterward.

Who can say what people willl like? Since I have it in my collection, I must have at one time...however, now I see it more as a curiosity of a certain trend in the movie industry than anything else.",1448236800,,1426,4.737903225806452

By the middle of the movie he was captivated and watched with excitement and amusement. As a young person in film he was able to point out the differences in 1972 vampire films as compared to our modern day horror films. He missed the CGI and the blood.l He knew where it was supposed to be and would state that it should be here at the points that his young mind would expect to see it. He was surprised that he could be involved in the story. He couldn't believe that he was enjoying this ""old"" movie. He even thought that the movie was just as good as Wesley Snipe's vampire film Blade. I was excited and enjoyed every moment of it. I relieved being in the Loews Gate Theater on Broadway in Brooklyn with my older brother and his wife. I had forgotten how beautiful Vonetta McGhee actually was.

1258241,5,B000035P6X,"Dracula makes but a brief appearance in this independent film that concerns itself primarily with Prince Mamuwalde (played superbly by William Marshall).  The African prince becomes the title character when he is bitten by Count Dracula himself.  Though the character of Dracula is given only a brief moment in the film, actor Charles Maculay delivers an incredible and lasting characterization that is both memorable and promising.  Maculay delivers one highly dramatic performance as the infamous vampire, a characterization that would have given Hammer a run for its money had AIP pursued the Count's further adventures with this actor as the lead.

In any event, BLACULA, despite its commercial title, intelligently succeeds  in combining the familiar Dracula legend with the creation of a new vampire terror.  The subplot about slavery issues was added to the script by William Marshall, who insisted that this film should deliver a message about African slavery and current bigotry issues that exist in contemporary America against African Americans.

In 1815, the Prince and his wife Luva (Vonette McGee) journey to Castle Dracula to influence the Count to place an embargo on the slave trade.  Their plans are thwarted when the bigoted Count Dracula places his curse on the Prince and seals him in a coffin for one hundred and fifty years.  As history has it, Dracula is eventually destroyed  for being the ruthless and savage tyrant that he is, but the Prince lives on, sealed in his coffin for a century and a half, until one day, two gay interior decorators unseal the coffin and release the brutal vampire on modern society.

The Negro Vampire plagues the city of modern-day Los Angeles until he happens upon a beautiful reincarnation of his long-dead Princess Luva (also played by Vonette McGee).  But our love-struck Blacula looses his refound Princess at the hands of vampire hunters, thus destroying his only reason to live again.  As the vampire hunters close in on him, Blacula both voluntarily and courageously exposes himself to the sun's lethal rays, which reduce him to dust forever - or so we think.

BLACULA is quite an impressive if not dated vampire film that fans will still enjoy and appreciate as much today as they did nearly forty years ago.  With the exception of the opening modern-day scenes involving two gay interior decorators (which are almost comedic in their over-the-top performances of what was the stereotype of homosexuals at the time) the film is taken quite seriously by its directors as well as its cast.

This film is part of a series of American-made black exploitation films made during the early 1970's, but BLACULA is perhaps the best of these vehicles, and well worth taking a look at.  BLACULA is 'sequeled'  by SCREAM BLACULA, SCREAM, an inferior effort that lacks the same bite that this original delivers.  There was also another 'black' vampire movie that was made in 1973 entitled GANJA AND HESS, (an atrocious film at best) and of course, let us never forget the abomination that is BLACKENSTEIN - another weak attempt at black exploitation films but good for a laugh if you have the time.

BLACULA is an excellent film that runs near true to his predecessor's own tale, and one that should be taken seriously.  It is fast-moving, enjoyable and has some true scare moments.  Take the time to see it, you won't regret it.",1334361600,5,3380,4.976868327402135
1258242,4,B000035P6X,"Most of the other people on this said it already. I only wanted to add one more piece.

William Marshall carried this movie. He showed Blacula to be a torn beast. He hated who he was but was trapped by it by the white man. That was the moral of the story. Black people can never be themselves because the white man cursed them to be just like them. William Marshall's genius showed that.",1282608000,,387,4.22972972972973

THis movie is not serious drama, but very funny, camp, laden with stereotypes, and a lot of fun. Did I mention that it was fun? I suppose that serious students of 70s sociology could use this for source material on how the better-off segments of black america cavorted and dressed in period, but it's just planin fun (that word again) for sci-fi and vampire movie fans.",1256688000,,640,4.333333333333333
1258244,5,B000035P6X,"Other reviews in this thread have thumb-nailed the history of the very interesting ""Blacksploitation"" films of the late 1960's - early 1970's, and there is no need to rehash that history here, nor navigate the well-turned plotting of this film.  While modern audiences will find the film dated and perhaps even ""cheesy,"" this would be unfair.  As historical artifact, it is a product of its time and genre, and unarguably one of the superior contributions to ""Blackspoitation"" theatre.  But especially noteworthy is the performance of the late William Marshall in the title role.  Like Boris Karloff in ""Frankenstein,"" his performance is not only layered, but in no way campy or overblown.  His regal vampire prince, Mamuwalde, is a being who feels pain and desires redemption but who cannot transcend his monstrous condition.  Marshall's restrained and even elegant imagining of the classical vampire allows the viewer to empathize with him even as they realize that his existence is a tragedy and that he must be destroyed. And the metaphors for slavery equalling vampirism are subtly woven through a generally well-written script which makes no apologies for presenting the viewer with any number of such paradoxes without offering any pat answers.

A superior film for the early 1970's, a superior example of ""Blacksploitation"" cinema at its very best, and a brilliant performance by the late William Marshall make ""Blacula"" excellent viewing still.",1248998400,3,1453,5.291304347826087

Being a horror movie fan, I really didn't care much about the story as long as I got to see William Marshall change into Blacula!  Watching it again 37 years later brings back great memories.  I also find that the story line is actually a pretty ingenious one.  ""Blacula"" was originally an African prince (and a really good man) who went to Transylvania to meet with Dracula, seeking his help to stop the slave trade in the late 1700's.  What a big mistake!  I wonder how he came up with that great idea (""Hey honey...I hear this Dracula cat is pretty cool with some clout - maybe HE can help...let's go visit him - it'll be a nice getaway!"")!  When the prince thought Drac was trying to put moves on his wife, the good prince tried to fight back to defend her honor and to escape the castle.  That's when the evil Dracula decided to turn the African prince into a vampire.  The corniest part of the movie (to me) was how he actually got the name ""Blacula"".  200 years later, the vampire prince makes his way to America to start his reign of terror!  The story is a good mixture of camp and classic horror.  It also has campy, comic-book like African American characters inspired from prototypes seen in previous Dracula movies, including Blacula himself sporting the traditional formalwear and an African American version of Van Helsing.  The nightclub scene was pretty funny - with the old school Soul Train look and dancing!  There was no nudity or extreme usage of any profanity in the movie, so other than a little blood here and there, it's safe for kids over 10 to watch (it is a PG movie).  I enjoyed the movie, expecting some degree of corn along with it.  If you go into this movie expecting nothing but good clean cheese and a little corn, you'll enjoy it too!",1246406400,,1840,4.447761194029851

1258247,4,B000035P6X,"In ""Blacula"" the great William Marshall plays Mamuwalde, a debonair African prince, who visits Dracula for help in ending the slave trade. Unfortunately for Mamuwalde, Dracula does not see eye to eye with him, bites his neck and curses him to thirst eternally for blood in a coffin as Blacula. The coffin is unearthed several centuries later and taken to Los Angeles, where Blacula is finally freed and the carnage ensues. The remainder of the plot is an odd gothic romance with unique cultural elements. The film is an excellent example of early 1970's blaxploitation films, featuring prototypical clothes and hairstyles, language, and even a cameo by The Hues Corporation singing songs by Waldo Holmes who wrote their signature smash ""Rock The Boat.""

The film itself obviously owes much of its substance to the traditions of Dracula films, but Marshall is an excellent actor, and far from being merely a stereotype, provides an excellent performance. Unfortunately, the other actors are not in his league, and some of the supporting performances leave a bit to be desired. Marshall has an amazing emotional range, and the genuine sense of sadness over the loss of his wife is far above the standards of the genre.

The DVD has a trailer and multilingual subtitles, otherwise there are no extras. I would have loved a commentary track (although sadly Marshall passed away in 2003) or a historical documentary putting ""Blacula"" into cultural focus. While the film is good humored, it has a captivating mixture of genuine horror and camp value that I enjoyed. ""Blacula"" can be enjoyed on several different levels, and I recommend it.",1238112000,2,1633,5.044444444444444
1258248,4,B000035P6X,"It was only a matter of time, wasn't it? There were many Blaxploitation flicks being made at this time, most of them by AIP, and it was inevitable that the genre would cross paths with the horror genre. After all, AIP had most of it's success in the B horror films it produced.
I'm not sure there's a single human being that can utter the title of this movie and not chuckle. It's almost genius in it's childishness. Oddly enough, the film isn't camp nor is it at all played for laughs. This was definitely an attempt to make a true horror film. Granted it's looked at by today's audiences as unintentionally funny, but that's only really due to the fashions, music and lingo of the time period.
In the film, African Prince Manuwalde is bitten by Count Dracula in the late 1700s and put under the vampire curse because Manuwalde wasn't gonna put up with Dracula's racist crap(Dracula was a strong supporter of slavery and even had the hots for Manuwalde's wife. Learn something new every day, huh?). So, Blacula is finally set free in the 70s and wastes no time in grabbing a bite to eat-in this case it's two gay antique dealers, one black, one white. This film certainly has equal opportunity exploitation. Soon he crosses paths with Vonetta McGee, who is the spittin' image of his late wife(McGee played his wife in the prologue). The rest of the film is his pursuit to woo and reunite with her while keeping his identity a secret...and feeding of course. Yes, yes, this a very cliched plot device and we've seen it in countless other vampire movies-the ol' My Wife From Hundreds Of Years Ago Has Been Reincarnated And I Must Win Her Back Again plot. Meanwhile a doctor played by Blaxploitation regular Thalmus Rasulala is investigating the strange deaths and finally stumbles upon the truth. He becomes a kind of modern(modern being the 1970s), black Dr. Van Helsing.
Yes, there's nothing terribly original about the film's plot. The originality is all in the way the plot is presented. Though I really liked how the film ended. As a horror film it's solid enough, but not very scary or suspenseful. Some might even think of it as boring, but I wasn't bored. What really kept me interested and in my opinion made the movie was the performance of William Marshall. He never made it very big after this role, though he was the King of Cartoons on Pee-Wee's Playhouse. Too bad coz he's quite a good actor. With his handsome yet sinister looks, deep voice and sophisticated demeanor, he was a fantastic choice. I'd have to say he reminds me of a black Christopher Lee.
So, while it may not be the gigglefest you hoped it would be, or very effective as an outright horror film, the movie is much better than it probably should have been with a title like Blacula. I think we can blame this fact on Marshall's performance, which definitely makes the movie.",1227744000,,2854,4.6200787401574805
1258249,4,B000035P6X,"In 1972, when I was a child, I saw the trailer for ""Blacula"" at the theatre and always wanted to see it.  Years later, I finally have and was not disappointed.  I don't care if it's considered a ""blaxploitation"" film.  It is merely a horror movie with characters who are primarily African-American.  Count Dracula's depiction as a racist was a great idea; it is not farfetched considering that he has little respect for human life.  Prince Mamuwalde begs Dracula to help him end the slave trade.  Instead, Dracula curses him with vampirism and gives him a new name; the prince of darkness wants Prince Mamuwalde to be a ""black version"" of himself, thus he deems him ""Blacula.""  I don't care for the name myself.  It sounds racist and Dracula must've intended it to be that way.  Mamuwalde is released from his coffin with an incredible hunger that he can't control.  He makes a meal out of two gay interior decorators and the nightmare begins.  Soon the vampires are multiplying in L.A, threatening to become an epidemic.  (This reminds me of Stephen King's ""Salem's Lot,"" which involves an entire town infested with vampirism.)  If the police don't act fast, a plague of vampires will overcome L.A.  This fast-paced movie has a great deal of action from beginning to end, and a high body count.  The acting is good; the cast is composed of attractive African-Americans who were popular in the seventies.  The vampires in this movie are extremely ghoulish and grotesque.  They gave me the creeps.  Some of those vampire women had fangs that would have shamed a sabre tooth tiger.  They were long!!  The movie also a strong romantic element.  Mamuwalde is pursuing a beautiful, young woman who reminds him of his deceased wife.  If only that meddlesome coroner wasn't getting in the way.  My favorite scene:  When the coroner and the police are tricked into going into a warehouse where they are trapped and beset upon by numerous vampires that are simply hideous.  ""Blacula"" would be fun to watch as a double feature with ""Dracula A.D. 1972.""  Both have a lot of hippie music and slang.  ""Blacula"" is a welcomed addition to anyone's collection of vampire movies or Hammer films.  I would've given it five stars if not for the overuse of certain prejudice terms that may have been appropriate for the seventies but are considered rude and offensive today.",1201910400,,2354,4.802992518703242

This fun campy piece came right between Kent State and Nixon's re-election, and remains one of the most amusing entries in exploitation cinema.

The whole affair would be wasted but for the splendid performance of Shakespearean trained actor William Marshall, who brought a dignity to a film that would have been otherwise doomed to pure silliness. Through his efforts, ""Blacula,"" which, under the perennial reign of Samuel Z. Arkoff, was lifted to a quality purely based on the strengths of one individual.

It must be remembered that ""black rights"" were not exactly warmly received back then. We as a nation were hot off the heels of the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, and some other general socio/political/economic upheavals that were very unwelcome by the powers that be.

This film was daring not only in the ""blaxploitation"" sense, but also in its depiction of homosexuality, still then a very much ""taboo"" subject...

Horror films have always been fertile ground for the ""taboo,"" and this little film is no exception. It has it's flaws, to be sure, but, for a low budget production, it holds its own.

1258256,5,B000035P6X,"1972's Blacula gave birth to the horror subgenre of the blaxploitation genre.  Its title probably turns more people away than draws them in, as it's hard to believe a film with such a campy, race-infused title could be any good (and might well be offensive).  Blacula, however, is not only a surprisingly good, somewhat serious film - it also works quite well as a horror movie.  It essentially follows the traditional mode of the Dracula story, and William Marshall succeeds in evoking the dual persona of the vampire as a creature to be both pitied and feared.  Blacula features some wonderful lines of dialogue that we will never hear again in the politically correct modern world, but for all its focus on African-American players in the drama, the racial element of the film is unimportant to the story itself - which, I suppose, was the whole point of the blaxploitation movement.

I have no idea why Prince Mumawalde thought Count Dracula an important diplomat who could use his influence to stop the slave trade, but he did - and he was quite wrong.  Dracula got so riled up that he cursed the African prince with both his name and affliction, dubbing him Blacula and locking him away inside a coffin so that he would endlessly hunger for the human blood he could never possibly attain.  There he lay for two centuries until a pair of exceedingly gay antique dealers bought Dracula's castle and threw a veritable hissy fit over the wonderfully ornate coffin they found in a secret room.  It's not hard to guess what happens when they return to America with their newly-acquired antique wares - there are soon two less outrageously gay men in the world.  Blacula then gets his first look at the new world around him - and almost immediately encounters a woman who is the spitting image of his beloved bride.  With Tina (Vonetta McGee) as our Mina, all we need is a Van Helsing character, and he soon emerges in the form of Tina's sister's main squeeze Dr. Gordon Thomas (Thalmus Rasulala, who is perhaps most familiar as Raj's father on What's Happening!!!).  With a number of corpses turning up with holes in their necks and then disappearing altogether, Gordon comes to believe that a vampire is on the loose.  These characters aren't too hard to convince; when Mumawalde tells Tina his true story, she reacts to the words slave trade but doesn't bat an eyelash over Mumawalde's claim that he was turned into a vampire by Dracula two hundreds year earlier.  The final confrontation, which you know is coming, plays out rather well, with Marshall bringing his Shakespearean training to bear in order to give the  scene a serious quality that it would probably have lacked otherwise.

Blacula is far from perfect in conception and execution, providing a number of really funny scenes and lines of dialogue.  My favorite moment comes early on, when one of Dracula's henchmen conks Mumawalde over the head with a pot or something - he obviously throws it across the room, coming closer to hitting a member of the production crew than Mumawalde himself.  Then there are the oil lamps that spontaneously combust, of course.  The whole film is just a little too outrageous to take completely seriously, but the depth and probity of Marshall's performance maintains an aura of respectability, some of the vampire scenes are somewhat eerie (although there's a woeful lack of blood each time some vampire puts the bite on another victim), and the ending achieves a poignancy that rises far above the blaxploitation origins of the film.  As a pretty decent horror movie as well as a blaxploitation classic, Blacula really is a must-see.",1121040000,5,3634,4.822866344605475

Prince Momuwalde, a Black African, comes to the legendary Count Dracula to seek his aid in ending the slave trade.  Instead of helping the prince, the evil count transforms him into a vampire: Blacula!
""Blacula"" is an interesting and entertaining blend of the vampire and ""Blaxploitation"" genres.  After the atmospheric opening sequence (and cool opening credits!) the action shifts to urban America in the 20th century.  A lot of elements make this film fun to watch: the fashions, hairstyles, music, and dance moves.
William Marshall brings both an animalistic ferocity and an aristocratic elegance to the title role; I would definitely rate his work among the best of cinematic vampire portrayals.  Marshall is superbly complemented by Thalmus Rasulala, who brings gravitas and intelligence to his portrayal of the scientific investigator who is on Blacula's case.
Yes, some aspects of the film might strike some viewers as cheesy or dated.

1258270,4,B000035P6X,"A 1970's twist on the vampire clich, BLACULA (1972) rises above its modest budget and ""blaxploitation"" genre to become a well-made cult-movie horror flick that has its share of the shocks, scares, and cheesy gore that endear movies of the era to contemporary horror fans.  And fans of cult films and B-movies can now rejoice, as Dracula's ""soul brother"" has been resurrected once again--this time getting his ""bytes"" in digitally via DVD from MGM.
18th-century African prince Mamuwalde and his wife meet with the original Count Dracula to seek his aid in abolishing the burgeoning slave trade.  But Dracula isn't the least bit interested in aiding the oppressed, and he instead puts the bite on Mamuwalde and turns HIM into a vamp--it is the Count himself who dubs Mamuwalde with the moniker BLACULA--then seals the prince in a coffin so that he will suffer through eternity with his new, and now unquenchable, thirst for blood. Fast forward nearly two centuries, where a couple of Los Angeles antique dealers are examining a batch of recent acquisitions, one of which is the ""box"" in which Mamuwalde is imprisoned. As expected, the two inadvertently free Mamuwalde and loose the bloodsucking brother to the ghettoes of L.A. (i.e., L.A.  la the 1970s).  For the most part, Mamuwalde's ""meals"" are comprised of the city's low-lifes, but when he encounters a woman who resembles his long-dead wife and tries to win her affections, he crosses swords with mainstream society and starts down the path towards his inevitable defeat and destruction.
The film is elevated above its meager budget and exploitative script by the excellent and believable title-role performance of the late William Marshall.  The deep, rich voice and Shakespearean training of this dynamic African-American actor brings dignity and intelligence to any role he plays, even an off-beat character like the vampire Blacula.  Horror and SF fans are likely to recognize Marshall in guest-star parts on TV shows like the original THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E., classic STAR TREK (Dr. Richard Daystrom in the episode ""The Ultimate Computer""), and THE WILD WILD WEST; and in starring or supporting roles in other genre films such as SKULLDUGGERY (1970), ABBY (1974), AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON (1987), and SORCERESS (1995).  Those who spend time in front of ""the tube"" on Saturday mornings might also remember seeing Marshall on PEE-WEE'S PLAYHOUSE, on which he portrayed The King of Cartoons from 1987 to 1991.
Some of the actors filling supporting roles in BLACULA also add to the film's quality and charm. These include Thalmus Rasulala, a ubiquitous character actor of TV and film; the lovely Denise Nicholas, probably best known for being one of the stars of the 1970s TV comedy-drama ROOM 222; Gordon Pinsent, a Canadian actor who has appeared on numerous TV shows and films; Vonetta McGee, who has starred or guest-starred in numerous TV shows and several films, including the genre flick REPO MAN (1984); and Elisha Cook, Jr., a familiar character actor who is often recognized from his portrayal of hoodlum Wilmer Cook in the classic noir film THE MALTESE FALCON (1941).
The DVD from MGM--released as part of the company's ""Soul Cinema"" line, though it could have just as easily fit in with their ""Midnite Movie"" series--offers an anamorphic widescreen copy of BLACULA in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1, and it appears that the print used for the transfer was in great shape.  No extras are offered other than the theatrical trailer, but the very reasonable price makes BLACULA painlessly accessible to any horror-film collector.",1080518400,3,3598,5.096774193548387

1258273,4,B000035P6X,"Wonderfully theatric & entertaining ""blaxploitation"" vampire film from 1972 occupies a special place in the hearts of many horror aficionado's for William Marshall's grand performance as the first notable black vampire, Blacula / Prince Manuwalde !  Shakespearian trained Marshall adds prestige and style to this film with his towering stature, ( at six foot five inches tall, Marshall was the same height as one of the screen's other great vampires, Christopher Lee ) his magnificent, baritone voice and dominating on screen presence.
Cashing in on the huge popularity of ""blaxploitation"" cinema of the early 1970's ( kick started the previous year by Melvin van Peebles controversial ""Sweet Sweetback's Baadassss Song"" ), American International Pictures resurrected the vampire genre into contemporary Los Angelos complete with gay interior decorators, jive talking dudes in groovy threads and swarms of white LAPD officers being defeated by an African American hero !!
Although Marshall is the film's stand out, both as the lead character, and the glue holding the film from sliding into too many clichs & stereotypes, credit must be given to the other key cast members for their contribution. Thalmus Rasulala is excellent as the puzzled doctor thrust into the role of vampire hunter, spunky Vonetta McGee contributes the movie's love interest, firstly as Prince Manuwalde's ill fated wife, Luva, and then as her reincarnation, Tina. And sad faced character actor, and eternal fall guy, Elisha Cook Jnr playing a morgue attendant ends up on the sharp end of a set of vampire fangs ! Arguably, the funniest line of the movie is uttered by the undertaker Swenson ( Lance Talyor Sr ), after he meets with Dr Gordon Thomas ( Thalmus Rasulala ) at the funeral home. After the inquisitive doctor leaves, the undertaker sighs and remarks "" That has got to be the rudest ****** I have ever met !"".
""Blacula""was highly successful upon release, spawning an unfortunately inferior sequel the following year, ""Scream, Blacula, Scream"". Although the movie boasted William Marshall back in the cape and 1970's African American film heroine, Pam Grier, it just couldn't recreate the same formula. To gain a wonderful insight on ""blaxploitation"" movies, grab the fantastic book ""What It Is.....What It Was ! The Black Film Explosion of the 1970's in Words & Pictures""...it includes a tremendous interview with William Marshall and his thoughts on the ""Blacula"" movies !!

1258274,4,B000035P6X,"The 1972 film ""Blacula"" is a much better example of the Blaxploitation period, which began with the success of ""Shaft"" the previous year, than it is as a vampire movie. William Marshall, with his booming voice, plays the title character and gives the film a sense of credibility that probably only James Earl Jones could have matched. Without Marshall's sense of dignity, ""Blacula"" would have been reduced to slapstick.  The story is that interior decorates buy the coffin of Prince Manuwalde andbring it back to Los Angeles, unaware that the African prince had been bitten by Dracula (Charles Macaulay) centuries before and locked inside. While wandering the nights in his eternal search for human blood, the prince sees Tina (Vonetta McGee), a woman who looks like his dear departed wife, Luva, and he is convinced she is his beloved reincarnated. While Blacula woos Tina, her friend Dr. Gordon Thomas (Thalmus Rasulala) figures out that this guy is a blood-sucking fiend and tries to hunt the vampire down.
Today the racial humor of this film seems dated, but in 1972 this movie was hip in being self-conscious about its blackness, which was the whole point of the Blaxploitation movement: to black movies made by black casts and crews for black audiences, instead of leaving it to Hollywood to ignore and denigrate blacks in the films that had been produced up to that point. The horror scenes are hokey in the extreme, but since they are basically being done for fun by director William Crain, it is hard to complain. Some critics have bemoaned the miss opportunity to make a telling critique of sexual hypocrisy in society, the way Bram Stoker's original novel did for the Victorian era (if you are inclined to read it that way), but the social agenda here is clearly race and not sex, which is totally appropriate as far as I am concerned. In addition to the 1973 sequel, ""Scream, Blacula, Scream,"" other Blaxploitation horror films that followed this one included ""Blackenstein,"" ""Dr. Black and Mr. Hyde,"" and ""The House on Skull Mountain.""

Blacula soon sets about harassing a woman who is the spitting image of his late wife, and he soon decides that she is the reincarnation of her. While all the afro haircuts and flares will have you chuckling, there are some chills at the climax, but I found the film ended abruptly. I haven't seen the sequel yet so I don't know if it picks up where this leaves off, but BLACULA is a fun movie for fright fans and cult movie addicts. Try imagining Rudy Ray Moore in the title role if you can. Now THAT would be scary.",1033603200,2,1109,4.4950495049504955
1258276,3,B000035P6X,"Now the idea of casting Afro-American actor as a vampire is not a strange one (look Eddie Murphy, for example), but in those days things were different.  Quickly cashing in on the raging trend of the blaxploitation, many films starring black actors were born.  This is one of them.
In the opening scene, Count Dracula turns The Black Prince into a vampire, swearing ""You shall be Blacula!!""  Now what next comes, you alreadly know.  He comes back to life in modern-day America, to taste blood.  Interesting thing is, though it gives still chill a little to your spine, it is the love between Blacula and his love (so he thinks) that moves us today.  William Marshall's charismatic voice (like that of James Earl Jones) is really amazing, and the star-crossed love between him and Vonetta MaGee should not be dismissed lightly.  Certainly, it has something moving that can be found in Coppola's ""Dracula,"" which also gives much stress on the count's lost love.  Speaking of Coppola, it is also interesting to see the uncanny resemblance between Vonetta McGee and Winona Rider.  Compare their eyes.",1010275200,,1096,4.913043478260869

Marshall gives an excellent performance as Mamawaulde. He is very seductive with his character and is very strong. I absolutely recommend this movie to everyone.

This movie has so many funny lines, and I couldn't stop laughing!  ""Let us not forget.. it is you that comes from the jungle.""  Definite classic that has stood the test of time.

7916700,3,B000035P6X,"In 1972 Blacula, two interior decorators, both homosexuals (why this fact is important to the film, I do not know, but it is mentioned several times) buy an unopened coffin, among other objects. The coffin contains the body of an African prince whom Dracula bit in 1780 when he also killed, but did not bite, the prince's wife. The two open the coffin and the prince whom Dracula had called Blacula emerges and begins to bite people, including the two who released him. He happens to see a woman who looks exactly like his killed wife and goes after her. Blacula is pursued by a black doctor who figures out that the story of Dracula is not fiction.
The cover of this film shows Blacula biting a white woman, but this does not occur in the film.
I gave the rating of three stars because I found the film's acting to be heavy-handed Grade B type acting, the make-up for Blacula bizarre, and I felt the film was over-long.
I had an opportunity to see the follow-up Blacula film, but since I disliked the first one, I did not want to see the second.",1508371200,,1046,4.396907216494846

7916703,4,B000035P6X,"Blacula (William Marshal-creator of the M-5 Multitronic system) comes back to life in the United States two hundred years later and does typical vampire stuff.

The film wasn't as camp as I thought it would be. It took itself too serious and in spite of what I may think has gone on to be a cult classic. I do have a few questions like how someone born in the 18th century, dormant for nearly 200 years would know their image would not show up on film. And what was with the randomly placed Brooke Shields' eyebrows and Elvis chops? Elisha Cook Jr. plays a ""Sam"" again, the same name he used to defend James T. Kirk. Denise Nicholas who was very popular with the TV series ""Room 222"" consented to star in the film.

The Soul Cinema version is light on extras.

Warning, if you are sensitive to offensive epithets about women, race and sexual orientation, or if you are a sensitive vampire folklore geek, better not watch because this movie  breaks all of the rules! LMBO!!  It was nice to see old actors from the 70's, my memory of them had long slipped away. Its full of corny and head scratching story lines that will have you saying ""Wait, What?"" throughout the movie!  Viewing goes great with wine or booze!",1472947200,3,567,4.485436893203883
