7753836,5,B01G3MQFXO,"American Ninja looks great on Blu-ray. It's clean of scratches and dust and the color looks nice for an older low budget movie. Not too grainy either. A good upgrade from DVD, and worth the money. Also, actual bonus material included. Old action B movies like these usually only get barebone releases with a trailer if you're lucky, so that's a big plus. You get commentary, Making of, and interviews with key actors. Overall, a nice slice of the past with modern restoration.",1477008000,8,476,4.746987951807229
7753837,5,B01G3MQFXO,"Blu-Ray: 5/5
Movie: 4/5

Blu-Ray - The Blu-Ray comes with an audio commentary with the director and some guy and a ""making of"" stuff. The video transfer quality is great with nice picture, however the audio is a tad bit questionable as the sound gets loud at certain point but it's very uncommon.

Movie: I use to hate these ninja movies because I was a PC f*** who felt that only Japanese actors should portray ninjas. Some time later in life I just didn't give a s*** and now I like this ignorant crap. American Ninja is very silly with nit-witted acting, clumsy yet appealing action with a plot of some sorts. Highly recommended to b-movie lovers.",1472688000,7,650,4.547008547008547
7753838,4,B01G3MQFXO,"First off I love the new Olive films releases of the American Ninja series. Loved the transfer and the special features. In typical fashion Olive hasn't released with a slipcover, that would have been nice. But I will say the one thing that puts me off is the fact that the covers on all four of these new issues are very dark. The covers don't stand out and they are dark on color. They could have done much better with the cover art. This of course has nothing to do with the film transfer for how much I love the movies.",1471737600,5,523,4.188118811881188
7753839,5,B01G3MQFXO,"I just want to clarify the new things for this new American ninja blue ray from olive These are brand new special features compare to the 88 films region b locked.

But I liked it when it came out, way back when, and wanted to see it again. I still enjoy it and will no doubt watch it a couple of times a year.
