7917303,5,B00003CWIN,"My granddaughter found this dvd at the library and checked it out everytime we would to there. I decided to look on line and see if I could find a copy to purchase for her. Since this is an older movie I knew it would be more difficult.
Fortunately I found this copy. It was listed as ""brand new"". It was brand new, still in packaging and was shipped in a very timely fashion.
I will use this company again and would certainly recommend them to anyone!",1366156800,,452,4.206896551724138

It's great for the younger lovers of this title that might not fully understand the classic film or the newer version with Sean Penn. I highly recomend  this to all horse lovers!",962496000,8,248,4.636363636363637
