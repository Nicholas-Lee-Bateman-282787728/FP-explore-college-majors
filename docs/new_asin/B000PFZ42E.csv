8191051,5,B000PFZ42E,"Gets you to realize that thinking is required rather than just accepting something as fact just because you were taught it in school.  Evolution cannot be proved; it truly is just a theory the same as every other theory, but often presented as fact.  I also was taught evolution in high school and never gave it a second thought until after I was an adult and started hearing other sides than the ones presented in school.",1520380800,,422,4.5394736842105265
8191052,5,B000PFZ42E,"An excellent video with factually accurate explanations of the theory that has been grasped by the wicked Leftists to explain away that being who have them life so they can fool themselves into believing their chosen lifestyles are okay, though they know they are living a lie and are fooling nobody but themselves.

Thanks to Kennedy's gang carrying on!

8191055,1,B000PFZ42E,"First off, they have Ann Coulter in here, which pretty much nails the lid in the coffin, you know it's gonna be wacky and full of crap. Funny how she goes on about how terrible Hitler was when she herself wants to kill arab leaders and go in and convert the whole region to christianity...hmm...sounds kinda like the same mentallity...as if she's not really against that idea, it just has to be what SHE wants, then a take over is just fine.

They make all the usual smug statements like ""now that Darwin's theory is starting to crumble.."", of which they present no real evidence of, nothing that hasn't been debunked over and over again anyway. This are tired old arguments.

My main problem with the issue of blaming a 'world view' on bad actions (and yes religion often gets an unfair poke in the eye as well) is that you really have to look at it closer to decide if it actually makes sense, on a case by base basis.

Science (discovery, studying nature) does not tell someone WHAT to do, if you are influenced by it to take action, YOU ARE ON YOU'RE OWN, you need to justify those actions and not just point the blame at some natural data.
Religion on the other hand, DOES tell you, or tries to guide in, in what to do, how to live. That is the entire purpose of it. So if you kill based on what your bible told you, you may of may not be doing it wrong...who's to say, there are thousands of interpretations of just the xian bible alone, and no certain way to know which one is correct, it's all a matter of opinion.

So one side has evidence, the other opinions and 'religious freedom' aka believe what ever you want no one can stop you. Both can cause unstable people to do wrong, that will always exist. But if one is real and the other fake, maybe we could at least do with out the fake one since it is not necissary. And then we can work on making the lunatics realize that science and reason and nature are not meant to tell you what to do about it, you need to work that out on your own and deal with the consequences.",1308441600,6,2031,4.22680412371134
8191056,1,B000PFZ42E,"there are so many problems with this movie. the movie starts with the host in a room full of scientific equipment, with  beakers presumably containing dry ice so it looks like scientific experiments are being performed. seriously? this is how you give an atmosphere of science? it's just silly. i would have taken the whole movie more seriously if those scenes hadn't been included.
the movie goes on to link evolution to hitler, claiming hitler was trying to spur evolution on in the advancement of his perfect race. evolution is an idea, and people can use it to do different things. quantum mechanics is a tool, and people used it to build atomic bombs. it also aids us in peaceful technology and medicine. antisemitism is very old, and was around way before evolution (as the movie does point out; the movie claims evolution gave it a scientific basis. this is somewhat true, as it gave it a pseudoscientific basis, just as creationism uses pseudoscience.). hitler would likely have done the same thing without evolution being around. the movie also ignores the fact that while hitler may have been espousing evolution and ordering the deaths of millions, the average german is a christian, so the average german soldier who was carting off jews and gypsies and putting them in concentration camps and the like were christian.
which is another thing the movie doesn't seem to mention: what about all the atrocities committed by christians? sure, the columbine kids may have been talking about natural selection, but what about christians that shoot abortion doctors, or christians who were in the KKK? do we argue that christianity is the cause? i don't. there are crazy people everywhere, crazy athiests, crazy muslims, crazy christians.
when they get into science, they quote steven jay gould discussing the problems of evolutionary theory. i could be wrong, but i believe his quotes are from his work advancing a specific theory of evolution that addressed the gaps in the fossil record, punctuated equilibrium. ann coulter, who is apparently a highly trained biologist, is able to help out, by explaining that there is no evidence to support evolution, in direct contrast with what the vast majority of biologists believe. i like her quote about how einstein wouldn't be allowed to be a teacher these days, because he ""wanted to know the mind of god."" she apparently doesn't know that einstein did not believe in a personal god (a god who watches you, listens to your prayers, and intervenes in the world). and she also claims that mentioning the cambrian will get you in a lot of trouble if you're a teacher. actually, the cambrian is a pretty standard part of the theory of evolution.
in short, this movie is nonsense. i could go on, citing just about everything they say, how they either ignore science or twist it around, but people who don't believe in evolution will watch this movie and have their faith confirmed, and people who do believe in evolution will (maybe) watch this and see it for the hogwash it is. i just hope people who are on the fence aren't swayed. luckily, this is poorly made, so hopefully that won't happen.",1281139200,7,3143,4.8638059701492535
8191057,5,B000PFZ42E,"This DVD is clear, concise, and shows the problems with Darwinism and it's latest variations.  The problem is not ""survival"" of the fittest (which works, is evident, is almost a tautology, and fits creation, ID or any other rational model of origins) but rather that evolution cannot provide an answer to the ""arrival"" of the fittest (by that I mean there is no good theory for the random generation of the extremely exquisite design in every complex and functional feature of living things.)  We ALWAYS seem to see evolution in HUMAN designs, for example the new Ford is a lot better than a 1956 Ford because human intelligence intervenes in the usual entropy of existence and efficiently keeps the best features while purposefully inventing complex new features to improve the brand.  Random changes to a Ford never help - when a ring gear on an Indy car fails and the car goes airborne, the driver is never happy because his car just improved or 'evolved'....  New features come by intellect and hard work, and then he may win the race.  In nature, as in human designs, random changes or mutations do not help.  Instead, we find massive and lopsided evidence that mutations cause disorders, disease, and death.  The fossils show massive evidence of extinction of species and the loss of their exquisite design information.  We find a startling shortage of ""missing links"" - there should be millions of them in the fossil record - but we find little to convince us that small changes could have bridged the gap between major species.  This video is sometimes amusing, sometimes scientific, but generally high quality.  Some evolutionists may be open minded enough to consider the claims made in this video - but generally they will retreat into a thicket of slogans, and when cornered admit ""we hope to find a solution"" to the problem of 'arrival'....",1263081600,7,1853,4.872611464968153

8191059,5,B000PFZ42E,"With the recent shift of education to indoctrination with naturalistic humanism (atheism) in the public schools and the forced insertion of a national religion (Darwinism) in the public arena by the courts, this video reveals that ideas do indeed have consequences. While discussion has been limited to only one side, the evidence is in: Darwin has had unintended consequences with catastrophic results.
