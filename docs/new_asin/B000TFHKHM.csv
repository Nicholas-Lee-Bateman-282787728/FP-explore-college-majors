2896978,5,B000TFHKHM,"Just great footage of great cars running side by side to 160 MPH.  If you like cars, you have to add this to your DVD collection. Want to see how the new M6 does against the new 911 Turbo? How about against the 996 Turbo? Watch the owners push their rides for all they have to win.

It's all here, made for car guys by car guys.",1192665600,3,328,3.8805970149253732
2896979,4,B000TFHKHM,"Overall I was impressed in the way these videos were put together.  I would like to see interviews with some of the drivers to get an idea of their thoughts and impressions.  I was able to attend the most recent airfield event and I believe by being able to hear the story right from the driver's mouth will also help validate some of the videos that a few might claim are suspect in their authenticity.

My only negative comment for all of these videos would be the shaky camera at times.  Overall a very fine and entertaining production.  I have watched my copy three times in one month!",1189987200,2,589,4.416666666666667
2896980,5,B000TFHKHM,"This is an awesome DVD.  I have always wondered how supercars do against each other beyond the traffic lights and even the quartermile.  This video shows awesome cars go almost to their maximum speeds.

Some cars that are quick from 0-60 lose badly at high speeds and vice versa....

Great reference DVD for any car nut!",1189728000,3,320,4.660714285714286
2896981,5,B000TFHKHM,"The video was well done.  I especially liked the graphics on each of the cars specifications before each race.  It is not super professional, but it encapsulates the races as intended.  Very fun, very cool!",1188259200,3,206,4.828571428571428
8208830,1,B000TFHKHM,"It sucks and should be taken of your listings, its listed as Jeremy clackson starring in it and he doesn't feature anywhere in the entire video, it was a waste of my time and money.",1455580800,,181,4.2
8208831,1,B000TFHKHM,"A out dated cell phone would have made a better video .  POOR SOUND N VIDEO
NOT EVEN WORTH 10 min. of watching it",1358985600,,113,3.7083333333333335
8208832,1,B000TFHKHM,This is nothing more than a bunch of roll on and drag races from guys with handheld video cameras. A complete waste of money. You can find better car videos on youtube.,1354406400,2,168,4.28125
8208833,1,B000TFHKHM,This DVD is unwatchable. It is absolutely terrible. It is shot entirely on a shaky handycam from inside the passenger window of a moving car. Do not waste your money or time on this DVD like I have.,1271116800,3,198,4.2368421052631575
8208834,5,B000TFHKHM,Nice comparison racing leaving driver error away... purely HP dependant.  Also the list of modifications done to each car before the races was helpful.  Can't wait to purchase the next series with the E92 M3!  My only complaint was lack of BluRay when I ordered.,1209254400,,262,4.777777777777778
8208835,5,B000TFHKHM,"I would recommd this DVD to any true car lover! Not just any cars - cars of class and power! Euros! M3s, M5, M6s vs other favs like RS4s and 911s.

Wantd to know how the M5 goes vs the RS4? What the 997 911 Turbo can really do? Ferrari F430!??! Get this DVD. Helps with car buying - you can really see if the sales men is talking truth or BS :P

Alot of work went into this and you can see it. Great job boys!",1206403200,2,409,3.689655172413793
8208836,2,B000TFHKHM,"This is an entertaining DVD, however, this event is run by BMW owners and some races are set up to favor BMW's. Keep this in mind when watching BMW's compete against other cars, the outcomes are not always valid.",1206316800,,212,4.461538461538462
