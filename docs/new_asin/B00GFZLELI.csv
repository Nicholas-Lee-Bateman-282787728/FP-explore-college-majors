8622726,3,B00GFZLELI,"Twenty two coming attraction trailers for serials, except for the last few mixed company trailers all from Universal Pictures. If you like serials and/or old trailers you'll probably enjoy this. Quality is average for Alpha which means nothing to brag about although I don't think these trailers exist in prime quality elements. Most of these trailers appear to have originated in 16mm film, many of them duped from the originals and sold to collectors over the years. Quite a few have been over scanned in the film to video transfer (many years ago I think!) and have some of the titles cut off. The trailers run a total of 55 minutes. There is a bonus of Chapter #1 of the Republic serial ""S.O.S. Coast Guard"" with Ralph Byrd and Bela Lugosi from a pretty good print which runs 30 minutes. This is an MOD (Manufactured On Demand) disc, burned on a DVD-R (the same type of disc you burn in your computer or standalone DVD recorder) rather than a regular pressed DVD. There have been scattered reports of early failures with this type of replication. These discs may play perfectly now but be unplayable at some time in the future...only time will tell!",1388275200,,1153,4.684729064039409
