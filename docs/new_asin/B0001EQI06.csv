It's replacement could play the whole opera but still had the problem in Act I at the same place.  Amazon.com has informed me that they have had difficulties with all shipments they have received so far and, thus, can not offer a replacement for this second DVD.  The only advice I have been offered is to wait a long time before reordering.

1994435,3,B0001EQI06,"After reading the raves, I was disappointed.  This production tries too hard to be cute and post-modern.  It all but suffocates Offenbach and his librettists, whose sharp satire and inspired operetta silliness are not improved by self-conscious Euro-trendy updating.  My apple goes to the Harnoncourt DVD, a simpler, fresher, faster-paced production with Vesselina Kasarova, a really attractive and sexy young Helen of Troy-the ditzy dame whose beauty, after all, is the whole point of the story, the McGuffin that all the male louts chase after.

I hate to be disrespectful to a distinguished artist, but Dame Felicity is fatally inappropriate in voice (not strong or agile) and appearance (too old) for this role-I mean Helen, not the superfluous middle-aged housewife.  The frame story of her dreaming she is the beautiful queen represents the producers' embarrassing concession to her age and wears mighty thin way before the first act curtain.  This device aggravates the clutter of an already over-populated, over-complicated, over-costumed, over-choreographed, over-stuffed staging that the cameras, trying too hard to keep up, can capture only in isolated snatches.  It all probably worked better for the live audience which could see everything and was spared the fast cuts and revealing close-ups.
Though the musical score is a ""critical edition"" (another example of trying too hard?) the musical performance is tight and restrained.  The chorus members and extras often look dazed or disengaged, as if they can't figure out what's going on either.  In the third act beach scene I wished the cameras would stand still long enough so I could read the entire menu of the refreshment stand in Greek letters with prices in drachmas-the most amusing thing in view.",1088467200,11,1769,5.311827956989247
1994436,5,B0001EQI06,"This La Belle Helene has been nominated for many awards and rightly so. It is so much fun. Dame Felicity Lott is a wonderful Helene, slightly older than Offenbach might have imagined, and this makes her performance so hilarious. She is a combination Lucille Ball and Joan Davis as she casts her eye on young Paris and yearns for him yet must present a proper outward appearance. And she sings gloriously!
The whole cast is oustanding and the operetta is presented with many clever bits. During the Dream Duet the chorus appears in the background as amorous sheep. In the first act Menelaus appears in his nightshirt while Paris, in the contest, has only a towel draped around him as he sings his Mt. Ida song. Best of all is the Act 1 conclusion. Though less than a minute long, Menalaus is whisked off on his journey to Crete by eight dancers dressed as travel agents who even manage to add a very brief Offenbach cancan to their highjinks. And a flight attendant briefly appears to lead the King away.
Hats off to Dame Felicity for a performence for the ages! And Offenbach must surely be smiling.",1087430400,26,1099,4.583756345177665
1994457,5,B0001EQI06,"I don't know why it took me so long to acquire ""Helene"" on DVD since I have had a CD of it for many years. Recollecting initial reviews were all positive, I can only chalk it up to inertia. Well, I was delighted with the whole performance and since France is unable to to come up with a qualified Helene, they could do no better than Flott. She is not a conventionally beautiful woman, she is, however, attractive, and skilled enough to convince you that she is beautiful. Besides a performance in the theatre is certainly not as invasive as a video camera.

I only wish that in the near future there will be a production of Hoffman that is as good that this; and while Helene is not a substitute I can recommend it to those who enjoy French operetta, are not put off by spoken dialogue, and an updated production. Much of the satire remains trenchant, in a generalized way and while the humor has been perhaps broadened by Pelly (though not to the extremes he went to in Fille du Regiment)I was enchanted by the performance and enjoyed the interviews after the performance.

HIghly recommended",1221523200,2,1094,4.52020202020202
1994458,5,B0001EQI06,"Some reviewers are fixated on the fact that Dame Feliciy Lott is too old and not beautiful enough to be Helen.  But how many Brunnhildes could mount a horse without breaking its back?  She makes good choices about how to present the role.  What got lost here is how well everyone else fits their part.  Especially, Marie-Ange Torodovitch is magnificent as Orestes.  If you are going to quibble about beauty, Yann Beuron isn't handsome enough to be Paris, but he does a remarkably good job of being the sort of confident young punk that Paris should be, and his voice is great for his part.  Michel Senechal is perfect for Menelaus as depicted here. Francois le Roux (Calchas) and Laurent Naouri (Agamemnon) are also good.

The staging is good, and the various time-warps involved fit with Offenbach's original time changes.

Bottom line: I thought this was a total blast--I've watched it many times, and would reccommend it to anyone who likes this kind of thing.  It's a really funny and amusing operetta, well worth watching.

I did not have any problems with disc quality, which has apparantly been erratic.",1157155200,8,1110,4.825396825396825
1994459,5,B0001EQI06,"I saw the operette only in live performance - and was very impressed.

Reading the comments here on amazon.com left me rather shocked by how much the public is fixated on age (a match between their phantasy and reality) instead of content or message. This was a perfect piece of art with a very powerful message of its own.

Reading the comments on Dame Lott's age makes me wonder whether we are really in the 21st century, where supposedly prejudices against

women are much less severe than in other centuries.

I think that those who critise her age just did not understand the layers in the message of the piece, and I am sorry for having to live at an age where so many individuals still have not grown intellectually and emotionally. Can anyone recommend me where I can immigrate to?",1148947200,7,789,4.574468085106383
1994460,5,B0001EQI06,"Certainly the best Helene I've seen on DVD with almost perfect sound, this production lives up to this style of social satire of upper crust Belle Epoque French society, where an enraged husband's wrath upon finding his wife in bed with a lover is actually taken to task by everyone else for not properly warning her that he was coming home, and therefore the blame for the scandal is entirely his! The director's sense of the ridiculous extended to the fun costuming. I thought Lott's performance was enchanting simply because she is living her dream, and lord knows her Paris is no GQ model either, but they both sing the difficult roles beautifully (she's allowed to use the French version of the score's mezzo aria in Act III, although I really prefer the German version's coloratura tri-partite fireworks), and they include the Act III Patriotic Trio, another favorite. This is social satire at its most stinging, especially if the viewer has familiarized him/herself with the Parisian society of Offenbach's time. The slams at organized, cynical religion are right on target as well. Tempos are fine, attitude is wonderful, what's not to enjoy? Even the subtitles are accurate!",1135641600,12,1183,5.01015228426396
1994461,5,B0001EQI06,"This is a wonderful production. Felicity Lott lost some of her past vocal quality, but she is an amazing comic actress and the concept of the production suits her admirably. The rest of the cast is outstanding too. Minkowski knows how to extract all the fun and wit in Offenbach spirited music, and the director, Laurent Pelly is one of the most talented opera directors active today. Don't miss it!

1994462,5,B0001EQI06,"I had never seen La Belle helene Before. Only heard it. This DVD is a must have. The whole cast is at her best, including Dame Felicity Lott. Maybe she is not Physically the perfect Helene (a little older for the role), but her singing and acting are the highest issues of this DVD. Costumes, stage design and choreography, makes this a wonderful experience and you can see it again and again and will enjoy it each time.

Very good sound and image quality (not usual for kultur's DVD's. I hope this label continue improving quality)

1994463,2,B0001EQI06,"Offenbach wrote a whole slew of wonderful, witty operettas.

This one is typical, a funny witty farce.

Minkowski has a terrific vision for the piece and the staging updates the action with a grab bag of jokes and double entendres.

But there is a terrible, fatal flaw in this DVD.  Couldn't they find someone else for the title role? La Belle Helene, the most beautiful woman in the world, played by an aging, over the hill,

overacting ""soprano"". Not only does Lott look her age but she sounds it.

Her tone is hard, glassy, and very brittle. She overacts in a very arch, mannered style.

This is such a shame as it's a fun piece, and imaginative production and except for the fatal flaw, a terrific ensemble of a cast.

It's impossible to believe that the Trojan War was fought over this Helen.",1105315200,4,797,4.524475524475524

En zone 2 (Pal-Scam) ces parutions sont sur tiquette TDK, tandis qu'en Amrique du nord (zone 1 systme NTSC) elles le sont sur tiquette KULTUR .

Les uvres et les productions sont superbes mais pour l'amateur nord-amricain la dception est grande. Il y a dans ces versions (zone 1) sur tiquette KULTUR un manque de professionnalisme aberrant et incomprhensible. Alors que les europens ont droit aux sous-titres en cinq langues don't le franais, ce qui aide  suivre le chant, on a droit ici qu' l'anglais, comme s'il n'y avait en Amrique ni francophones, ni francophiles, ni hispanophones. C'est avoir bien peu de considration pour les huit millions de canadiens qui vivent en franais et qui sont un public de premier choix pour des uvres franaises.

Aucun livret ne viendra vous donner quelques dtails sur le chef, la production ou les interprtes, KULTUR a jug qu'un simple feuillet mentionnant le chapter  correspondant  un air suffirait. Et sur les deux DVD achets, un seul avait le feuillet correspondant. Dans le boitier de Plate j'ai eu droit au feuillet de opra Giulio Cesare / Opera Australia!!!

I bought the DVD (based on many of the reviews posted here), tossed it on the heap of ""I'll watch someday"" DVDs, and finally started watching it one evening but turned it off almost immediately because I found the opening set of arias un petit peu tros longue...Went back to it several days later, skipped through the DVD, and finally sat down and watched it from beginning to end.  Now it's become one of my favorite ways to wind down the day--watching  one or more acts of La Belle Helene.

Flott is priceless. The look of resigned indignation when Michel Senechal (Menelaus) curls himself up against her when the bolt of lightning strikes at the end of Act One; her conspiratorial glances to the audience during the Love Duet in Act Two, and then, her sashaying around as a drunk Helen at the end of Act Three are all magnificent.  Michel's acting abilities come into full play in the Patriotic Trio (which is extremely funny.)  And I could go down the list....

This error cannot be corrected by reviewers so please be patient and either scroll down or read the extra review for additional information. Thanks - Ian Giles

.....................................

This is a production from 1997 and in stereo only. It also has some of the most unflattering costumes that have ever been provided for Kasarova, and she has certainly been the victim of costume designers before! None of this matters and simply becomes irrelevant given the sheer sparkle and wit of the production and the performers throughout a most enjoyable evening's entertainment. As regards the sound, the stereo is so good that one soon forgets all about rear speakers and sub-woofers!

The story is, of course, a total spoof, or send-up of the lead up to the Trojan Wars. For his libretto, Offenbach was fortunate to have talented librettists so the plot never falters. This production continues with the caricature nature of the piece in its choice of costumes which are generally bizarre but nevertheless are acceptable in the circumstances. Stage props and scenery are rather minimalist but effective in the same sort of way.

The cast is fully engaged and participate at all points with boundless enthusiasm. This comment applies not just to the soloists but also to the entire chorus who are evidently enjoying this piece of French chaotic humour. Fortunately the humour is not over-worked so, as a result, it all works as it should and is really very funny for much of the time. In particular, Kasarova as Helene, is an inspired choice as she not only has one of the finest mezzo-sopranos on the world stage today, but she also has a wonderful sense of stage humour and humorous timing. Those who know her performance in the Barber of Seville will know what to expect!

Kasarova is matched by an enthusiastic Paris (Deon van der Walt), as well as strong supporting roles supplied by Carlos Chausson as Calcas, Volker Vogel as Menelaus, Liliana Nichiteanu as Orestes and Oliver Widmer as Agamennon. The other supporting solo cast are all equally enjoyable to follow.

The orchestra is on fine form under Nicholaus Harnoncourt who is typically attentive to every passing detail and ensures very high standards are met throughout. He even joins the whole cast for a communal 'knees-up' for the curtain calls as the orchestra provide one more chorus.

The camera work is excellent and the imaging is totally clear as most of the coverage is close enough for it not to matter that this precedes HD recording. The stereo sound is more than adequate to give complete involvement for the viewer.

This is a particularly enjoyable presentation of one of Offenbach's most enjoyable light operas. The audience were highly enthusiastic and appreciative and I would expect this to be the reaction of most purchasers of this disc. For that reason I would suggest that this is a good candidate for the full 5 stars despite its age and lack of current HD recording techniques. Please note that this review is based on the Arthaus original issue.",1350691200,2,3203,4.9962476547842405
8011392,5,B0001EQI06,"... make the most of it!

This Parisian production of Offenbach's silliest operetta, La Belle H&eacute;l&egrave;ne, is flamboyantly 'updated' both in visual and dramatic manner -- whacky costumes, sets, and occasional bits of anachronistic humor blending can-can kicks with post-Broadway dance, asking the aging-but-still-spry Felicity Lott to sing while lying on her back stage front, etc. Utter ""Euro-trash"", in short, of the kind Americans hffily denounce ... and utterly amusing. Making whimsy out of what can so easily be stodgy. I can't imagine staging operetta of the Belle Epoch in any way more enjoyable for an audience of the 21st C. The applause recorded at the end of the performance confirms that Parisians of 2000 shared my opinion.

Can Offenbach be performed WITHOUT Dame Felicity Lott? Yes, of course, she's too old and hardly beautiful enough for Helen of Troy, but she makes the role totally hers, totally plausible. Tenor Yann Beuron sings the role as Paris as if it were the best of Donizetti or Verdi, a fine example of how good singing can make insipid music sound far better than it is. The three French 'character' actor/singers - Michel Senechal as Menelaus, Francois Le Roux as Calchas, and the superb Laurent Naori as Agamemnon - are thigh-slappingly funny. Nothing is sacred, musically or literarily, in this spoof of classicism; the whole affect depends on impudence and absurdity, and that's what this production delivers.",1314489600,3,1453,5.178723404255319
8011393,1,B0001EQI06,"I was not familiar with this operetta, but I thought Harnoncourt and the Zurich Opera has got to be good. Unfortunately, it was hard to see past the silly costumes, which turned me right off.",1285372800,2,191,4.485714285714286
8011394,4,B0001EQI06,"The key roles are quite well sung and played. Lott not only sings but swings in quite good fashion as do all the featured cast. Perhaps the best of all in a relatively small part is Michel Senechel, playing Menelous, the husband. He acts and sings the role in a manner equal to the best doing similar work on the Broadway (or London, Paris, Berlin) stage. One thinks immediately of a Jack Gilford or Zero Mostel in Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (or many other productions. The supporting players, including the bare chested California beach boy types, sing surprisingly well. Surely no opera company could find such well-endowed singers without going outside the company regulars.
I must differ, however, with most other reviewers with regard to the comedy in the production. Witty it is not. Broad it certainly is. Not to say broad is unacceptable. It is to say that it usually plays much better in a live  rather than a filmed performance. Even Jerome Robbins, master of slapstick on Broadway, would have had big trouble creating equal fun in Hollywood. The best slapstick for the camera was created by those born to film or the very few vaudevillians who had the gift.
So, I can commend the DVD as an enjoyable variation on the theme of the original (with Offenbach's music getting a very fair presentation). The comedy will or will not be fun-filled depending on the viewer's personal taste. It certainly hit the top of the laugh meter with the live audience and most of the reviewers.",1249603200,4,1504,4.718631178707224

Mr Jackson must have no humour / brains.  The more I listen to Offenbach, the more levels of satire I find, the more amazed I am at his genius.

And we have marvelous singer/actors here and clever costumes if you can read latin.  Kasarova is excellent as Helene and the Afrikaaner Van der Walt has a nice lyric, yet masculine voice, easily soaring above high C.

While the staging is not elaborate, some cute business has characters occasionally interacting with the conductor, even descending into the pit.  Very delightful.
