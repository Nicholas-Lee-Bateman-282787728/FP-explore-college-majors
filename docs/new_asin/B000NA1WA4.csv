8175917,3,B000NA1WA4,"These newsreels histories are okay but all suffer from the same flaws.  The introduction is useless (Nazi Germany 101) and time-consuming, and pointless; obviously anybody buying original newsreel footage from Nazi Germany already knows who Hitler was.  They would have been better served to tell us something about the propaganda companies and how the newsreels were actually produced and shown (this information is completely lacking).  The film transfers are not great, varying from poor to good.  The English translation is laughable, as is often the case the producers seem to feel they have to choose between somebody who speaks German and somebody who knows a little about WW2, but cannot have both.  I rate it as highly as I have because it is a full set for a very reasonable price.",1443312000,,791,5.00763358778626

8175919,4,B000NA1WA4,"Vol. 8, 1941, Part 4. This takes us to late October 1941 in front of Moscow.

You will see the mighty Wehrmacht at its most powerful in this program. I do not think they were ever again at this level of supply or morale.

Here are scenes of everyday soldier and airmen life, filmed by German cameramen. You will not see this anywhere else.

Scenes of U-boat activity include one that would later be dramatized in the 1981 film Das Boot. This is the one in the engine room where the crew don gas masks to fix a broken valve, during an attack on a merchant ship.

The previous program, Vol. 7, had several such scenes, showing up in Das Boot. We see the Luftwaffe in action at French bases: Several British Hurricanes and Spitfires are shot down by Me 109s. Next, North Africa. Five more Hawker Hurricanes are shot down by Me109s. We see Col. (later Lieutenant General) Galland (shown incorrectly on subtitles as Gallant). He was a LtCol in the previous program. The action in the USSR is shown at Kiev, Kharkov, in the South, and around Leningrad.

We see many happy German troops advancing. The soldiers mortars look like our 60 mm and 81 mm mortars that I saw in the Marines in the early 1970s. I was an ordnance officer and I think we copied the German ones.

Hundreds of horses are shown in convoys and in artillery units. In some scenes, motorized transport shares the road with horse-drawn wagons or guns. You will see many 88mm AA guns in action. The PzKwIV short barrel 75 mm tank is shown over and over. No mention is made that its rounds bounced off the T-34.

The music is better in this episode than in the others; we have Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries, and no more band marches.

To avoid the annoying English language track, set the audio to the German language with English subtitles, then start the program from Main Menu Scenes Reel 1 1941 Part 4. This also eliminates the first several minutes of annoying English language material.",1368576000,3,1950,4.504249291784703
