7969461,4,B00006IUFJ,An older video of 4 music videos by Nonpoint. There is no live music on the DVD other than the concert footage used in the videos. Sound quality is good. I think there is also a short interview section. I bought this DVD used to watch while I rise my stationary bike and I enjoy it. Just wish it was a little longer.,1274054400,,316,4.031746031746032
7969462,5,B00006IUFJ,After seeing these guys live several times you'll notice how much time they take on meeting their fan base. This DVD is great for those who want to learn a lil more about them when the first got noticed! Great Videos and Great Interviews! Hopefully their new CD due out at the end of the year will have a bonus DVD. Give their original style a listen.,1127260800,,351,4.253731343283582
7969463,5,B00006IUFJ,"This DVD is awesome. I love watching it because everytime I do, I feel like I'm back at one of the many concerts I've been to of theirs. If you haven't seen them live yet, you don't know what you're missing! Buy the DVD and then you'll know!!  [...]",1107129600,,249,4.081632653061225
7969464,4,B00006IUFJ,"'Accompaniment' serves as a video collection for Nonpoint. Now obviously since they are a newer band, they don't have a lot of videos (hence, the price). Included are the videos for 'Mindtrip,' 'What A Day,' 'Endure,' and 'Your Signs.' 'Mindtrip' is basically a live footage video. Nothing much to it, low budget and typical. 'What A Day' is a performance video with better production values (which also seems to be showing Nonpoint's ugliest fans...). 'Endure' is basically a collage of Ozzfest 2001. 'Your Signs' is a weird video. It has the band performing in a desert with two guys with boxes for heads fighting with each other (reminds me of Marilyn Manson's 'I Don't Like The Drugs' video). The videos serve their purpose and the sound quality on this DVD is fantastic (5.1 Surround). We also get a little 7-minute long mini-bio with the band where they basically talk about the typical stuff (The new record, the old record, how they got started, what influences them, etc.). It's a pretty good buy if you are into the band, and since MTV never plays videos, let alone, Nonpoint videos, this is the only place you'll be seeing them.",1048982400,5,1139,4.786802030456853
