7039263,5,B00UGQK7ZQ,"My husband bought this DVD for my twin one year olds and they absolutely LOVE this DVD!  There are plenty of songs to keep them interested.  What I love as a bilingual parent trying to teach my twins Spanish, is how much Spanish is incorporated into the story and songs.  My twins kick with excitement and smile whenever they know this DVD is coming on.  I highly recommend this DVD.  It's entertaining for them and also educational.",1310515200,,433,4.571428571428571
7039264,5,B00UGQK7ZQ,"my son and I had the wonderful opportunity to watch Dora the Explorer: It's Haircut Day! on DVD. And thanks to my son, I've seen each episode at least a dozen times. I know all the songs and walk around the house singing ""corta el peloooooo."" This DVD is filled with wonderful adventures about getting haircuts, helping others, birthday cakes, and so much more. Our favorite is certainly Dora's Hair Raising Adventure where she ends up taking a lot of extra people with her to the barber shop only to find out that the barber won't cut their hair because he doesn't have dessert with his lunch. (That sounds like a good reason to me!) Dora is fun as always and the It's Haircut Day DVD is perfect for any preschooler.",1308182400,,717,4.480916030534351

I should add, because they're played in adult's presence - they are great for ""kids of all ages"".",1389052800,,262,4.9772727272727275
8706547,5,B00UGQK7ZQ,"I bought it for her. I've never watched it, but by her judgment, she loved it a lot. So I'm happy if she is. I'm just glad I could find it on here. $14 at a movie store. I think I paid 7 for it on here. Quite a savings.",1379203200,,219,3.4

8706551,5,B00UGQK7ZQ,"My 2 year-old son -- a #1 Dora fan -- received this for Christmas. It was a great pick, because he adores Dora and Boots ans we were trying to get him ready to go for his first haircut. He took this one to heart -- he woke up the morning of his cut really excited, smiled all the way through. When he came home, he wanted to watch this DVD and was proud to ""show"" Dora and Boots that he got his haircut, too! He liked the other episodes as well. If you have a Dora-loving kid in your house, I recommend this as an addition to your collection. Good price, too.",1358726400,,559,3.9557522123893807
