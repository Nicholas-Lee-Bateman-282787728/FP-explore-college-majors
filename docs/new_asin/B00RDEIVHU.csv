6928353,3,B00RDEIVHU,"The history and action moves around the GO game.
I confess I do not know much about this game. (After the movie I'll start looking at it, definitively)
Maybe knowing more about this game will help to better understand the motivations behind each character in the movie.
I said maybe, because the story, twists & turns are interesting enough to enjoy this movie.
Overall, nice action film.",1435536000,3,388,4.8059701492537314

8694951,2,B00RDEIVHU,"Movie might be awesome for all I know, I'll never find out. When I saw it was for region A, I figured ""no problem, I have a region free PS4!"", as always (I've watched lots of movies from Asia, the US, and Europe), and didn't expect the movie to have a region block in it that would cause it not to work even on a region free player...Happened with two other movies I bought as well, all from the same publishing company...Now I know to avoid anything from those jerks...",1501632000,,470,4.233333333333333
8694952,5,B00RDEIVHU,"This is just an extremely cool movie. Slick. Fast paced. Great action. Great story. Tension. Romance. Bromance. This flick has it all. Jung Woo-sung is excellent in this movie as he has been in so many others but it is the brash and funny Kim In-kwon that sort of steals the show. Centered around the game of Go or baduk, this is assuredly the most violent movie you will ever see about a board game. No, Chess Match Carnage wasn't better. There Can Be Only Uno pales in comparison. Monopoly Massacre doesn't hold a candle. The Divine Move is the one to watch. And enjoy. And watch again. I streamed it first and immediately bought a copy.",1462924800,,639,4.47008547008547

8694955,5,B00RDEIVHU,"If you like GO, or Baduk as its known in Korea, this is a movie you should see.  Excellent performances and lots of action.  The story is probably a 6/10 but its done really well.  My only regret about a lot of these international movies - and The Divine Move is one of them - is the lack of a digital copy with the BR.  Oh well, movie was still great.",1446595200,,352,3.915492957746479
8694956,5,B00RDEIVHU,"I never knew what this game Go was and frankly I still don't. But aside from the I loved this wonderful Korean Movie. I have to be very honest, I am a sucker for any Korean, Japanese or Chinese movie. the action, the fight scenes, the stories are always interesting. This was no exception. I recommend it most highly BUT much violence and this was gory at times. Bravo to the cast and the director, this movie flowed, I was never bored at all.",1446595200,4,443,4.285714285714286
8694957,5,B00RDEIVHU,"Jung Woo Sung easy on the eyes, great with the fists, the storyline great easy to follow and rooting the good to win every way just like life choose a side and fight for it and always defend the family.",1444867200,,202,4.075
8694958,5,B00RDEIVHU,"great movie! Even if you don't understand the nature of the game or how it's played - you can still appreciate the action, drama, and storyline. Jung Woo Sung is an excellent actor as is Lee Bum Soo",1444435200,2,198,4.2368421052631575
