8121797,4,B000FFJYZ2,"Odd approach, off-kilter,  but rather amazing undertones for circa 1950. If you want to see something unique and different for a change, view ""The Flaming Urge"". Watchable, low-key easy going style and fine supporting actors. Cathy Downs gives an appealing if somewhat bemused performance that is essential to the controversial ending.",1456790400,,335,5.568627450980392
8121798,4,B000FFJYZ2,"FLAMING URGE is, in its way a remarkable film by one time director-writer Harold Ericson which ought to be better known. It concerns the arrival in a small town of Tom Smith (Harold Lloyd, Jnr). Tom has a problem - he is irresistibly attracted to fires, compulsively chasing every fire engine which is en route to a blaze. He has chosen this town as the level of fire incidents is the smallest on record that he can discover, in order to help himself overcome his pyrophilia. Tom finds himself a job in a local store with an understanding boss, but soon discovers that the number of fires locally is suddenly increasing and, despite his protests, he becomes chief suspect as the local arsonist...

A pleasant and curious enough film about an eccentric compulsion on first viewing, it is only when one discovers that 'flaming' is homosexual slang for quick arousal/or 'flaunting effeminate traits' that the real sociological interest emerges. In real life Harold LLoyd Jnr was the great comedian's gay, alcoholic son who died early at age 40, victim of his life style. In manner and speech in this, one of his few starring vehicles, he reminds one of his famous father, albeit without the signature glasses. Thus FLAMING URGE's early comic scenes in the drapery store where the young man works, recall the elder Lloyd's work in the first half of SAFETY LAST, even to the point of a couple of sly, specific visual references to the older comedy. Lloyd Snr of course was straight while some of the impact of FLAMING URGE is an implied gay deconstruction of a famous screen persona. One wonders what dad said when he saw it.

In short, a fun film with substantial gay coding throughout - right down to the good deal of banter situated around the tie counter (at one point the star creates a gigantic bow tie, by way of marketing) and play on pencils. Tom's 'problem' is treated with a calmness and respect for difference throughout - miles away from the sniggering and caricature with which it might have been received elsewhere. And while the film necessarily ends with a heterosexual wedding, it proves unconvincing. FLAMING URGE can be recommended, especially to those who like lesser known gay/camp classics such as TURNABOUT. I downloaded my copy from a (legal) free site on the web, as Alpha's discs can sometimes be very inferior in choice of original source material. I haven't checked their disc for quality but if the original is the same, then the quality is average.",1295136000,,2474,4.77803738317757
8121799,3,B000FFJYZ2,"The youngest child of famous silent-era star Harold Lloyd had a troubled personal life and fitful screen career that would probably never have occurred at all if not for his dad's support. After years of alcohol abuse and being battered by his boyfriends, Lloyd Jr. suffered a massive stroke at age 34 from which he never fully recovered, and died 5 years later.

In his second feature THE FLAMING URGE, Harold is Tom Smith, a department store clerk with a penchant for chasing after fire trucks. His obsession with emergency response may cost Tom his job and worse, after a series of arsons are pinned on him.
