I had always asked the question of why would Nixon risk his entire presidency on a second rate burglary of the DNC where he was obviously leading McGovern in large numbers in the polls prior to the election. It had to be to find something more than just the strategy of the democrats in winning the 72 election. This books explains in well documented detail of how Nixon manipulated events in Cuba during the Eisenhower Administration and again during the Kennedy administration with known Mofia and CIA assassins who were trained and planning an assassination of Fidel Castro. A second plan to do the same was in progress using the CIA known by JFK but the other plan with the mob and Nixon was not known about until years later. This is what Nixon was after in the DNC safe a large album of documents called the Cuba Dossier which exposed the Nixon CIA Mofia plot to assassinate Fidel Castro. Could these same elements from the secret Nixon plan to assassinate Castro have been involved in the assassination of JFK? No wonder Nixon risked it all to recover the evidence which would be treason in and of itself the assassination plots would ruin his presidency. He feared with good reason that some of his associates could be tied to the JFK hit squad.

Anyone who has interest in the saga of Watergate would have followed the scandal to some length on TV and Washington Post, you may have watched the Academy award winning movie ""All the President's Men"" and Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's book with the same name. This video documents the Watergate crime and eventual downfall of President Nixon. At the end of this episode several experts including, then Washington Post editor, Ben Bradley agrees that President Nixon is most fascination person. Watergate is a gripping story and mesmerizes the reader by the style of operation of White house; it has all the suspense of a drama; mafia style organization within the compounds of the White House by the very people who are sworn to defend the U.S. constitution.

The most fascinating part of the book is about the identity of Deep Throat, the ""expert"" commentator about Bob Woodward's sources. It is amazing that several people involved in the conspiracy and some political pundits wrongly predicted that Deep as a composite of several people or may be a White House official or from FBI. Now we know the identity of Deep Throat is none other than the number two man at the FBI, Mark Felt whose identity was revealed in June 2005. It is interesting that Mike Wallace identifies him as the likely candidate but gives up on him over a minor reason that he was a non smoker in 1970s. Bob Woodward claims that he was a chain smoker, and that is what we saw in the movie version; the part of Deep Throat was played by actor Hal Holbrook. The video also interviews Katharine Graham owner of Washington Post very briefly: Highly recommended to all interested in the Watergate scandal
