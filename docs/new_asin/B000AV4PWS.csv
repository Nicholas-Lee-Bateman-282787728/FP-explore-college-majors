8079926,4,B000AV4PWS,"Ever since a young age I have been facinated with quicksand - even to the point where I tried to make it in buckets in my backyard.

Since then I have read quite a bit about quicksand and learnt the real facts but at that young age I believed what I saw on TV!

This video dispels a number of myths about the infamous phenomena that Hollywood has mis-portrayed. The main one being the fact that it is actually almost impossible to sink beneath the surface of a quicksand as the human body is more bouyant than quicksand. What quicksand will do is lock your body in with an exceptionally powerful grip (especially if the sand grains are very fine) and let the elements kill you (such as rising tides, the cold, heat, thirst, hunger etc). The grip can be so tight that it is impossible to escape without the assistance of a rescue team and a number of real life examples of this are shown.

The video cites one tragic example of a couple who, early one morning, rode off on their motorbike which became bogged only a few hundred meters from the shore. The woman got off the bike to push and suddenly sank knee deep in a quicksand. After 2 hours of digging her husband only managed to get one leg out - the other being firmly locked in place. They were, unfortunately, in a notorius quicksand area East of Anchorage (Alaska) that is known for its high tides that can rise many meters in a matter of hours. It was exactly this that caused her to drown - even after having another rescue worker and her husband trying to dig her out!

The video also features interviews with people that have become trapped and quite a bit of footage (both real life and re-enacted) of rescue attempts.

The information is well presented and accurate and if you are like me and have always been facinated by this mixture of fine sand and water you will certainly be entertained for an hour!",1126224000,4,1868,4.402898550724638
