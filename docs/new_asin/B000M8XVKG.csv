8167243,5,B000M8XVKG,"I purchased this DVD for my Dad, who is a great fan of the big bands and especially misses the New Years Eve shows that used to be televised with Guy Lombardo.  After watching it, my Dad was so impressed he called me specially to thank me again for getting it.  He asked if there were any more like it.  I haven't been able to locate any, but I'm glad I found one, anyway.",1321228800,4,372,4.0
