2718047,5,B000M1AXY0,I recommend this product to anyone who is at an intermediate to advanced cardio workout. I love it!! I feel really challenged when doing it and I feel very accomplished when completing it. Better yet you can mix up the order of your workout to get a great variety and prevent bordem!! I find Cathe to be great though. Every workout she has I love!! I have nothing but praises for this workout!!,1224460800,,394,4.410958904109589
2718048,4,B000M1AXY0,"This is a major cardio workout. If you really want to sweat and get your heart rate up, this is a good one. If you are looking for weight training too,  pick one of Cathe's other videos.",1203292800,,186,4.027027027027027
2718049,5,B000M1AXY0,This is a great video!  Very fun!  There is cardio along with weights so it makes for a great workout!,1203206400,,102,4.05
2718050,4,B000M1AXY0,"Ok, this was my first introduction to Cathe.  Oh my goodness does she ever work you out and then some.  Do not attempt this workout if you've never done step cardio before.  I'd recommend starting with a six inch step. I really liked this workout as well.  I found my favorites were the Low Impact Circuit and Body Max 2 sections, so much so I bought those two separate DVD's in there entirety.  I didn't really like the Drill Max one.  I found I didn't have enough room to do that and it was sort of tough on my knees.  So, I took one star off for that.  I will say that Cathe does give great instruction and executes perfect form so pay close attention.  I'd advise to watch the DVD two or three times before doing it just to really make sure you are familar with the moves.  Its a fun workout and this one does come with mixes as well.  This one is great if you just want a cardio workout on it.  This was a fun workout over all and I'd definitely say this is geared to the experienced exerciser or stepper.",1203120000,2,1010,4.123076923076923
2718051,4,B000M1AXY0,"This was my first introduction to cathe along with buts and guts.  I have done a great deal of step classes over the years and I have to say the first step routine on this dvd is very very hard.  There is no cueing of the moves.  They are called as they are done. Its annoying.  You have to be very quick on your feet to keep up. This is why I don't go the full five stars.

The rest of this dvd is easy!  Well, easier to follow.  The drills are super and no brain work required.  So if you want to just work out, sweat and burn the drill section is for you. The other step routines require co-ordination and thinking.  I personally don't like thinking when I work out as I am usually in too much pain.  Since purchasing this dvd I have bought more Cathe dvds and I have found others to be more challenging.  If you are begiining out in the world of Cathe, keep your step height low.  You are working out AT YOUR PACE so if you get lost, are confused, just basic step in place or v step or modify to suit you.

Beginners be aware that this dvd is a real workout and you will find it tough going but you only do what you can and keep within your limitations.  Just modify the moves to suit. it really is a dvd for those who have had Cathe experience or have done a lot of step.  The cardio section is face paced and you will need to again have a bit of fitnessto complete.  Beginners and intermediates and first timers keep your step low and work at your pace not Cathes. The moves get repeated so you can keep trying a move until you get it, then move on.  I bought this tape and I couldn't wait to buy others.  She is the ultimate in advanced home areobics and I think Cathe is too good for anybody to miss out on!",1191628800,3,1715,3.9941176470588236
2718052,5,B000M1AXY0,"I do agree with the others - if you're a novice to step workouts, then this probably isn't the workout for you.

If you're a veteran Cathe fan, though (like myself), and you've been doing her workouts for a while, you'll be able to fall right into place with this pretty easily, as she uses a lot of her usual moves, but as always, with her usual creative spin and choreography. Oh, and did I mention you'll probably love it?

This is an ADVANCED workout - so again, if you're a novice exerciser, I'd avise to steer clear and try some of Cathe's workouts that are more geared towards beginners and intermediates.

This was a tough workout my first time through. I wear a HRM when I work out, and I was in my anaerobic zone probably through a good 60% of this workout. The six drills at the end of the workout were what kept me in the anaerobic zone the longest. The nice thing about those drills, though, is that they're ""no-brainers"" where choreography is concerned. There's nothing complex, just a lot of intensity.

I'm very glad I got this DVD. It makes an excellent cardio companion to the rest of my workout library. I'm eager to try out the premixes, too (which SOOO make Cathe's DVDs worth the $20+ you pay for them.)",1178928000,3,1225,4.407079646017699
2718053,4,B000M1AXY0,"I discovered step about two months ago. Since I love to dance it seemed like the perfect exercise option. The Cathe tapes are fun and they are a great workout. I enjoy the challenge of learning the steps and being able to keep up witht the dvd. I found though, that my knees were beginning to hurt so I made a precautionary trip to the doctors. She said that step can potentially be harmful to the knees. It isn't the stepping up but the landing that can do damage. I had bought Ryka crosstraining shoes and had the step at 6"". I am really disappointed but I am headed to the physical therapist to see if there is a compromise to not doing it at all. Before you invest in the tapes, be sure to talk to your doctor.",1178928000,4,714,4.143884892086331
2718054,4,B000M1AXY0,"This is my first time using a Cathe video, so I didn't really know what to expect.  But first and foremost, you NEED coordination!  I was a dancer for 10 years and I could barely follow this tape.  There was no instruction on how to do the moves, since they are pulled from other workouts.  Other than that, you really work up a sweat!! Once I get the hang of it, it will be one of my favorite videos I'm sure, but I was just very frustrated the first time.  If you're uncoordinated---FORGET IT!!!",1178236800,9,497,4.24468085106383
8165601,5,B000M1AXY0,The best step video. Cathe aint messing around!,1473206400,,47,5.0
8165602,5,B000M1AXY0,"My suggestion is to first practice the routine with just the platform to learn all the moves and familiarize yourself with the workout while Concentrating on form and technique. Repeat, repeat, repeat, practice, practice, practice. When you have finally mastered the routine you can get give it your all. This is an awesome, energizing, motivational workout. If you learn the routine it will pay dividends. I am a male athlete who uses step workouts as a crosstraining tool.",1456617600,,474,5.089743589743589
8165603,5,B000M1AXY0,"dvd was in good condition. I lost my old copy during a move, so needed to replace it...so i did the end.",1394496000,,104,3.772727272727273
8165604,4,B000M1AXY0,"This workout video is definitely for the person who just wants to step up higher.  Workouts are tough and difficult to follow if you haven't done much step aerobics.  Also, it isn't clear how to follow the workouts.  With that said, the product is good quality, high intensity workouts and I firmly intend to keep at it until I learn the routines.",1358208000,,347,4.564516129032258
8165605,5,B000M1AXY0,"I finally got a professional grade step and have been experimenting with videos and this one made the grade.
The long length really gave Cathe a chance to get your muscles quivering. Well worth the price  and
Challenging even for someone in top form.",1354924800,,250,4.681818181818182
8165606,5,B000M1AXY0,"Cardio Fusion is a compilation of cardio sections from Drill Max, Body Max 2 and Low Impact Circuit workouts.  I can certainly understand why several reviewers thought the choreography was tough to pick up.  If you're familiar with these workouts, then doing Fusion should be easier.  Easier from a choreography perspective, not a cardio one.  This is definitely not a workout to start with if you're not familiar with Cathe, even if you're advanced.

I must admit that I never really got into the individual workouts in this series, nicknamed the ""sash series"" because of the workout outfits.  The workouts are cardio and muscle endurance and I much prefer splits. That being said, I loved this workout!

This is one tough workout.  It is truly for advanced steppers.  Cathe doesn't give a lot of modifications.  Many times I was literally marching in place or barely getting my feet off the ground in the jumps, but my heart rate was way up there.

What I especially enjoyed about this workout:

**it seemed like a totally new workout, even though it is just portions of other workouts.
**the editing is good, so the transition from one section to the next flowed well.
**the music had a driving beat and that made me want to work out harder.
**the two premixes, including step only and a longer premix.

Some things to note about this workout:

**if you're new to Cathe, advanced or not, this is NOT the workout to start with.  At a minimum, you should be familiar with Drill Max, Body Max 2 and Low Impact Circuit.  In these workouts, Cathe breaks down the step routines.
**the cover states that all you need is a step.  Well, you also need a 5 pound dumbbell and a stability ball.
**the workout takes up a lot of space.  I like how Cathe has us using the stability ball for a cardio drill, except I work out in my basement.  The ceilings are very low, so I have to substitute a 2 pound medicine ball instead.

If you're looking for a tough and fun cardio workout and you're familiar with Cathe's other workouts, you will enjoy this one.",1297555200,,2041,4.570247933884297
8165607,5,B000M1AXY0,"I have been a fan of Cathe for a long time from Fit TV and recently started buying her videos; this one is a mix of several of previous released videos and as always she delivers a fun, challenging and full of energy exercise, you are sure to get a great workout in a little time.",1251504000,,280,4.017857142857143
8165608,5,B000M1AXY0,This is a great workout - it gives lots of mix and match options to allow for medium to high intensity - and a long or short cardio workout.  The section that has no breakdown is a little hard to pick up - but is only  about 6 minutes long so it is easy to save for a day when you are ready for giving your brain an early morning work out too - and skip when you aren't.,1241222400,,370,3.670886075949367
8165609,1,B000M1AXY0,"This product is great if your looking for a BIG challenge. I don't have the time to learn all the difficult moves, especially when half of them your supposed to do facing the wall behind you instead of facing the t.v. so you can actually see what they are doing. Not for beginners or those who don't care to take the time to memorize the workout before you can actually do it to lose weight. (which is the whole reason for buying it).",1239667200,3,434,4.240963855421687
8165610,3,B000M1AXY0,"I knew from the minute I started the warm-up that I was in trouble. I exercise 5-6 days a week, at least one of those days with various step DVD's with different instructors (Christy Taylor, Amy Bento, Kathy Smith etc).  This is by far the most difficult step DVD that I have purchased.  After the warm-up, Cathe goes into a flurry of steps with no introduction.  I am guessing that these different sections are compiltions of previously released DVDs,and this is the end of a very, very difficult routine.
Each 5-11 minute circuit is like this.  You go into a whirlwind of steps, twirling, jumping and twisting with little advance cueing and lead-up steps.  I ended up just doing my own steps to the beat of the music and still got a very good workout which is why I gave this 3 stars instead of 2.
I did not like the cueing at all.  I felt like I came into a the middle of a class and everyone else had already had the lead-up steps.
You may like this if you have already practiced with the DVD's that lead up to this compilations.",1228694400,6,1033,4.3264248704663215
