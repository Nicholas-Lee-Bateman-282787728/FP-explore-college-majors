8763478,5,B01GSW5VDE,"Just like with Pokmon, fans of MST3K just ""gotta get 'em all"".  I missed this during the original run, so I'm glad that Shout Factory is redoing them.",1476057600,4,150,4.357142857142857
8763479,4,B01GSW5VDE,"No extras in this set; in fact, the ""special features"" on the 2003 Rhino discs -- host segment outtakes that show the sausage being made, even if it is kinda boring to watch -- are absent from this Shout Factory re-release. Volume III serves up two lackluster episodes, a shorts compilation, and a very funny fifth season entry that's still available as a stand-alone Shout disc.

""More dead people. Funny, huh?""
THE SIDEHACKERS (episode #202) is the 1969 biker movie responsible for MST3K's ""somebody has to watch THE WHOLE MOVIE before choosing it for the show"" policy. Ross Hagen and Michael Pataki are rival bikers -- one mumbles, the other rants -- on their way to a bloody showdown after Hagen's girlfriend is gang-raped and murdered. The episode starts off well, with some great riffs on the idiotic-looking sport of sidehacking, but Joel and company have a hard time coming up with anything really funny to say about the revenge tragedy plot; the jokes strike me as lame, obvious, and even puritanical at times. (When a character gets shot and someone quips ""I hope that was the director,"" I think they mean it.)

""MY DINNER WITH ANDRE had more locations than this movie!""
THE UNEARTHLY (episode #320) is a 1957 horror movie with John Carradine hamming it up as a mad scientist obsessed with the secret of eternal youth, and Tor Johnson uttering the immortal line, ""Time for go to bed!""  The movie's drab, claustrophobic sets -- an office, a staircase, a closet-like dungeon -- are indicative of its Poverty Row budget, and it features below-average riffing that consists mostly of the guys practicing their celebrity impressions, including Groucho Marx, Rodney Dangerfield, and John Carradine himself.  It's preceded by the shorts ""Posture Pals"" and ""Appreciating Our Parents,"" in which the riffing is as uninspired as it is in the feature.

""Dick Van Dyke had a better English accent!""
Things improve drastically in THE ATOMIC BRAIN (episode #518), a 1963 cheesefest about brain transplants, grave robbery, kidnapped young women, and a hateful crone with a mad scientist on her payroll and a nuclear reactor in her basement. Mike, Trace, and Kevin mine comedy gold in this nothing movie, and do a great job on the short ""What About Juvenile Delinquency?"" as well. (Mike, Kevin, and Bill Corbett would take another swing at this short years later at RiffTrax, but with less successful jokes.)

Some viewers like MST3K shorts compilations; I'm not one of them. Still, SHORTS VOL. 2 collects six of the show's best, including ""Catching Trouble,"" ""What to Do on a Date,"" ""Last Clear Chance,"" ""A Day at the Fair,"" ""Keeping Clean & Neat,"" and ""The Days of Our Years.""",1469664000,22,2671,4.924444444444444
