265288,5,6300217620,"It seems like ""magical"" is a word only used by hack reviewers from suspicious-sounding newspapers.  But really, there's no better word for this production.  The richly romantic score is wonderfully played by the orchestra, and sensitively conducted by Fulton.  The singers are uniformly good.  The fantasy elements are spectacular... the house, the forest, the flying of angels and witches add immeasurably to the production.  The only thing that I wasn't overly fond of was at certain moments the production was ""childrened down,"" like with the occasional addition of somewhat corny graphics.  But much better than some productions that remove anything ""dangerous"" at all, and have the witch played by a man as a drag queen!  All in all this is a wonderful production of a wonderful opera.  You'll be whistling the folksy score for days, and that haunting, meltingly beautiful prayer will stick with you for a long time.",1039132800,34,921,5.134228187919463
265289,5,6300217620,"Speaking as a former dancing mushroom (yes, one of the ones seen in this video), I can say that this is one of my favorite videos! As a child, performing in this production was an exciting rush. As an adult, watching the opera still gives me a thrill. The production is beautiful, the stars incredible and the dancing mushrooms...well...
  An excellent introduction to opera and an enjoyable video for children and adults alike!",1034640000,25,428,4.8493150684931505
265290,3,6300217620,"It may be just a quirk of mine, but I have yet to appreciate a translated opera.  Had I realised beforehand that this was in English, I would not have ordered it.  Opera translations never (I can think of no exceptions)come off.  The libretto never lyrically matches the music as the composer intended, and the worst translations are into English; they become so prosaic and silly.  Can you imagine a Wagnerian singing, ""Come in and shut the door...please be quiet, now""?
Nevertheless, though marred by the translation, this piece was well and traditionally staged, competently acted, and nicely played.  If you do not suffer from the same quirk as I do, then you will enjoy this Met production.",1009497600,38,695,4.8559322033898304
265291,5,6300217620,"I saw this 1982 performance at the Met and was very impressed by the charm of the production.  Hansel and Gretel was originally written (and can be performed) as a relatively small scale opera, but the Met brought a great deal of wonderful large-scale stagecraft to the opera in a way that makes the production even more enjoyable.  Some of the great stage momemnts for me are the gingerbread house coming up from the stage, the various animals (really kids) who come out on stage, the 14 angels protecting the children, and the transformation of the gingerbread children into real children. The production on DVD is from a live broadcast.  The singing is very good with Judith Blegen (Gretel), Frederica von Stade  (Hansel), and a very hammy witch (Rosalind Elias). The DVD is well indexed and sound quality is quite good -- the audience is well behaved!  This is an opera (and opera production) that people of all ages will like, especially kids.  Buy it and enjoy it!",980812800,36,970,4.744047619047619
265292,5,6300217620,"I saw and taped this 1982 performance when it was originally telecast, and it had been a part of our family's Christmas tradition until the tape wore out. What a delight to experience the magic of this performance on DVD! While opera, in general, is not noted for high quality acting, the performances of Judith Blegen (Gretel) and Frderica von Stade ( Hansel), who never seems to be other than visually and sonically lovely, are simply captivating! Blegen's soprano is lyric, light and smooth, and is perfectly matched by von Sade's mezzo. And Rosalind Elias, who earlier in her career was anything but, is a fantastic witch, who is obviously having a great time flying all over the stage. Humperdinck's lush and melodic score is well played by the Met Orchestra, and perfectly conducted by the talented Thomas Fulton. The disc's video is a wonderful marriage of performance and technology, and if the sound isn't Dolby 5.1, well this is opera, not Mission Impossible, so that the Dolby Stereo, works very well. This Christmas Eve ( or any other time that suits your fancy), kick back, suspend your disbelief, and be transported to Fairyland. This performance is guaranteed to please, whether you are an operaphile or a novice. And it is a perfect introduction to opera and classical music for children.

265324,2,6300217620,"Visually, the opera is beautiful. However, between all of the soprano females, the overall performance was very monotone and boring. This really needed more diversity in singers. This is the first time a Met collection had disappointed us.",1451779200,,239,5.315789473684211

A silence stretched out uncomfortably, I suppose due in part to the embarrassment of the professionals on the panel over the naivety of the question.  Finally, a male member (I forget who) came to the rescue (more than that, really) by saying (approximately), ""Well, for me, it has always been The Presentation of the Rose.""  No one disagreed.

And Rosallnd Elias - whom I remember well from for her fine singing at Tanglewood around 1950 - was a GREAT witch - complete with that green toungue!  The production provided a variety of  added - but welcome - imaginative visual effects, and the fine children's chorus in the opera's closing scene was fine indeed.

The two main characters acted by Judith Blegen and Frederica von Stade , there body language were amazing specifically since they were performing the part of children.
The witch looked like a real one. The rest of the cast were very good.
The singing was excellent as well as the scenery and the costumes.
Before I bought this DVD I had never heard this opera, even though when I saw it I recognized some of the music.
I decided to buy it because I had read good reviewers about this performance and I enjoyed a lot, it was fan. This is a charming production.",1362268800,2,765,4.239726027397261

265409,4,6300217620,"On Christmas Day 1982, my family watched this performance on Channel 13. It was also being broadcast on the radio, and we recorded the broadcast on a cassette. (We didn't have a VCR until about 6 months later). A week later, on New Year's Day, I was sitting in the fifth row of the orchestra section at the Metropolitan Opera House watching this opera live. It was spellbinding.
While shopping on Amazon, I was excited to see the DVD was available and excitedly bought it. It bring back wonderful memories of seeing the opera. (When I saw it live, I paid very close attention near the end to see how the children appeared.)
If I have to make a critique about the TV performance, it is the camera shots. Much of the shots and angles were quite poor, especially when the father takes the stage the first time.
One reviewer spoke of the corny graphics, and watching it now, for 2011, it does look corny. This is what PBS used during their broadcast. The graphics you see is the scenery around the stage at the Met. While listening to the overture when I saw it live, I was waiting for the graphics to jump out, but they didn't. I have not watched the bonus features yet, so cannot comment on them.
In the DVD, there is a booklet with a synopsis of the history of Hansel and Gretel and some quotes from reviewers. The New York Times wrote of Rosalind Elias, who is the witch, that she gave the children a hard time, and thoroughly enjoys it. This is an understatement. From the moment the Elias steps on stage, she is in command and has the audience captive along with Hansel and Gretel, right up until she takes her final bow during the curtain call. I had forgotten how much fund she is.
The Hansel and Gretel opera has been changed in recent years, and in my opinion, looks rather ridiculous and has none of the magic flare that this version has. I wish they would bring back this version, because it is simply magical.
Opera aficionados may be annoyed that it is not in German, but I love it, and am looking forward to sharing it with my daughter.",1321660800,4,2047,4.389473684210526
265410,5,6300217620,"Hansel and Gretel is generally regarded as a children's opera; but, in fact, it is a masterpiece to be enjoyed by listeners of all ages. Humperdinck was heavily influenced by Wagner and in Hansel and Gretel he produced an opera in the Wagnerian style but more accessible than Wagner's operas in length and humanity. This is one of the few operas ever written which is beautiful from beginning to end. Although I love this opera I have been disappointed in most of the video performances of it which I've seen so far. But I'm very pleased with this thoroughly satisfying performance by the Metropolitan Opera. Frederica von Stade as Hansel and Judith Blegen as Gretel are physically attractive as well as accomplished singers. The rest of the cast is quite good and the conducting and orchestral performance are outstanding. Yes, this performance is presented in English rather than the original German, but the translation is quite good and I quickly became absorbed in the beauty of this magnificent opera without concern for the language. If you want to introduce your children or grandchlldren to opera you could not find a better one than this to do so. But please don't overlook the beauty of this operatic masterpiece just because the plot involves children.",1314230400,3,1264,4.938967136150235
265411,5,6300217620,"This DVD of the Metropolitan Opera's ""Hansel and Gretel"" dates from 1982.  I remember the broadcast was hosted by ""Sesame Street""'s own Big Bird who explained to the viewers, many of them families with smaller children what to expect from an opera.  This production dated from 1967 and enjoyed a 40-year run at the Met.  It is a family-friendly production with fairy-tale sets, costumes and even young performers as forest creatures.  Judith Blegen and Fredirica von Stade are perfect in the roles of Gretel and Hansel, respectively and Rosiland Ellis is a wonderful witch.  The performers in the roles of Father and Mother are also very good, as well as the Sandman and Dew Fairy.  Special notice goes to the gingerbread children chorus.  They are well rehearsed, professional-acting, and sing very well.  The production is sung in English but the Met has been singing Hansel and Gretel in English for about 60 years.  I imagine this is because not many young people understand German.  Yes, the lyrics are simple but keep in mind children usually like simple, easy to follow lyrics, especially in a fairy tale.  There are English subtitles to augment the singing but, for the most part, the diction of the singers is excellent and you don't need them.  The Dream Pantomime is a sight to behold with its 14 angels magically appearing and protecting the children.  The sets all have a fairy-tale charm and the appearance of the witch's cottage is really special and got applause from the audience.  The orchestra is well conducted with a right balance of Wagnerian weight and opposing lightness.  These are illustrations over the Prelude but, hey, kids like pictures and I liked that they were sketches of the original designs.  The sound and direction/camerawork are excellent. All-in-all this is a GREAT DVD and only the most jaded person would not find something to like about it.",1294444800,5,1883,4.93015873015873
265412,5,6300217620,"This is a great production that I have been viewing since 1982.  This is the way Hansel and Gretel should be presented as a children's fairy tale--not the updated garbage that this being presented in several other versions (including the MET's) latest stagings.  Beautiful production, excellent singing, intelligent tranlsations that goes with the settings, thoroughly entertaining.  I glad this is finally available again in an excellent transfer.",1294099200,8,448,5.656716417910448
265413,5,6300217620,"Thank goodness this is back out in print!  My VCR version of this production was worn out and I sampled a couple other versions for use in the classroom.  The Met's newest version, set in 1930's, may have some value in its challenge to original staging, but is not as accessible as this 1980's production, nor is it truly appropriate as this version of the 1980's.  Furthermore, the rendering this as a traditional fairy tale, helps separate this from reality and makes it more palatable and less scary for children.
In the 1980's version, the story is accessible and linkable to history in its setting (a boon for teaching).  (I do use the themes of starvation, and responsibility of all parties brought out in the newer version of what I call a ""Cautionary Tale"".)

Both Blegen and von Stade are young and in beautiful voice.  Their interpretation of young children is exuberant, fresh and delightful.  The witch's ride on the broomstick is always my favorite part.  Elias is a fun witch to watch, she relishes and truly brings her role to life.  Again, she is evil and children can recognize this, but her evilness isn't overwhelming and is delightful to watch. The children's chorus is beautiful...thank you for beautiful bell tone and diction.  I use this as an example of good singing whilst having children view the video.

Thank you for offering this again.

UPDATE:  I've just purchased an additional version, listed here.  It has subtitles, which I find truly valuable for students (and myself).  Thank you for making this product even better.",1291161600,6,1553,4.85171102661597

265436,5,6300217620,"This is the best Hansel and Gretel to date. The Metropolitan Opera, or any other opera company will find it hard to top this one! It's been out on VHS tape for quite a while. Thank goodness they decided to put it on DVD! Now we have it on a medium that will last and last and last. For many, many Christmases into the future! Preserving the wonderful action and singing of these superb opera stars for all future generations! And this version is fun, in addition to being almost a spiritual experience. Great fun for both adults and children! And an excellent way to introduce children to opera without diminishing the musical quality of opera. Strange, how a very, very old fairy tale can speak to our modern, cynical age in such an uplifting fashion. Very deep truths about Life can be relayed via such mythical means. Engelbert Humperdinck was simultaneously ahead of his time and steeped in the Eternal Verities of Existence at one and the same time. For which we all ought to be thankful! And thankful, too, to the Met for letting all of this come through in such a glorious way!",1285977600,6,1084,4.535714285714286
265437,5,6300217620,"Over the past few weeks, the newspapers and magazines that cover the classical music community have been following the final year of von Stade's singing career.  Here in Chicago, we have been treated to a final recital, a performance of Heggie's ""Three Decembers,"" and we await a concert performance of Mozart's ""Cosi.""  Then she will be gone.

In anticipation of the loss, I have continued to look for compact discs and dvd's that preserve the memory of her musical journey.  The Humperdinck opera is one in which her voice, with its timbre and mellowness, fits perfectly.  This traditional production of the opera adds to its desirability.  The Metropolitan production doesn't try to push some avante garde ideas about the story but relies on the charm of the children's tale instead.

All of the principals and even the minor characters fit perfectly into the production, including Flicka.  She has remarked that her career has been about portraying naughty boys, Hansel and Cherubino being two of the most prominent.  She is able to portray the mischievous boy as well as the protective big brother with ease while spinning out her golden mezzo which has pleased this listeners ear ever since I first heard her sing over twenty-five years ago.  Over the years I have purchased almost all of her recordings.  I add this DVD to my collection with unbridled enthusiasm.  No von Stade fan should be without this disc.",1279497600,5,1417,4.932489451476793
265438,5,6300217620,"This is good work but the opening minutes are marred by a flaw common to the human condition and universal throughout opera.  The high-pitched female voice, the soprano for example, is usually unintelligible when uttering words in song, and this is the norm for all of opera.  I never heard anyone point this fact out.  Listen to the shrill female voice of the Gretel character and try to understand what words are being said.  I could hardly understand a single one.",1279065600,,467,4.728395061728395
265439,5,6300217620,"I originally taped this off television when it was first broadcast in 1982.  Those were the days when Hansel and Gretel was about two waifs lost in the Black Forest.  Currently productions, I guess in an effort to make a fairy tale contemporary, now have a mother who tries to overdose, randy parents who need a ""nooner"", a witch who shows up with bare breasts, as well as any number of ""touches"" that must leave most children as completely bewildered as I am trying to figure out what is going onstage.  This reissue of a delightful, traditional performance  from The Met reminds us that a Fairy Tale is best told in a simple, easy to follow, manner.  For those parents out there who want to introduce their children to opera without a trip to the therapist first should snap this DVD up before it goes out of print again.  The sonics are terrific and it still looks pretty good even in light of its blu-ray competition.",1273622400,17,921,4.518072289156627
265440,5,6300217620,"DG has finally released the famous 1982 Merrill / O'Hearn Met production of ""Hansel and Gretel"" which entertained and captivated thousands of opera lovers for nearly four decades.  I, and many of my friends, would make this an annual event at the Met.  Both children and adults loved this production with all its beautiful fantasies.  The cast is great...the English translation by Norman Kelly is clear in keeping with the composer's intentions...and the orchestration is fantastic.  I consider it the BEST production of H&G available on DVD...and one of the all-around BEST productions of any opera available.

It is totally different from the 2007 Richard Jones fiasco Met production and has no pigs, vomiting or depressing contents like the Jones version.  The Dream Pantomime alone is worth watching.  If you like opera productions the way the composer intended...you will love this!!!  Thanks to DG, the memory of Nat Merrill and Humperdinck.

265442,5,6300217620,"I borrowed this version of Hansel and Gretel from the library shortly after watching the December 2007 version of the very same opera this Christmas. Hansel and Gretel has been my favorite opera ever since I heard the dramatized story version on CD by Jane Powell, but I was almost turned off by the gloomy, surreal world I saw in the modern version. It was refreshing watching opera the way it should have been done. Even though there were some dark undertones and a hideous witch, the 1982 Hansel and Gretel had a cheer and innocence that I found truly disarming.

To start with, the relationship between the two main characters was beautiful to see. Judith Blegen played such a cute little girl, curly pigtails and all! Meanwhile, Frderica von Stade was a convincing older brother. My little sister, who was watching the movie with me, even mentioned what a good brother Hansel was after watching the scene where he covers her up with his coat at night while they're lost in the woods. They occasionally squabbled, which added realism to the story, but you could tell they loved each other.

They really had to look out for each other when they got to the gingerbread house! As I said before, the witch was pretty scary with her warty nose, long chin and green petticoats, fingers, and tongue! We all gasped when we got our first glimpse of her frightening face through the window of the gingerbread house. However, once she began singing her lively song (""So Hop, Hop, Hop"") and flying on her broomstick, I think she became so fascinating that we forget to be afraid! Rolsalind Elias did an excellent job.

So did everyone else at the Met it seems; the prop people, the costume designers, the angels, the orchestra, the conductor and anyone else I may have forgotten. And of course Englebert Humperdinck's music is just about the most beautiful ever written! The whole production was top notch. The only characters I didn't really love were the couple who played Hansel and Gretel's parents. They were definitely adequate, so I'm not complaining. I'm just saying that I didn't particularly care for them.

Oh, I had one more thing to say. This is the first opera I've seen in English and I could understand nearly every word, although there were no subtitles. The translation seemed very good and went well with the music. I know some people swear by the original German, but I thought it was kind of nice to understand what everyone was saying. Bottom line: if you want to see a traditional staged version of Hansel and Gretel in English, this is the one to see! Order it from your library or buy it on the Met's website!",1200009600,8,2626,4.665226781857451
265443,5,6300217620,"This is the Metropolitan Opera's grand production of Hansel and Gretel, starring Julith Blegen and Frederica von Stade.
  It is absolutely a delight to the eyes and ears, and is so deliciously done, you can almost smell the gingerbread and taste the witch's candy house.  This is from a live performance, and it is likely you will gasp in amazement (as the live audience did) as the witch's house appears on stage.  Equally well-executed are the flying angels who guard Hansel and Gretel's sleep.  (The Met made sure it didn't look like singers hanging from wires--they really look like angels, and the effect is dazzling.)
  You'll love the witch, as she flies on her broom, or sticks out her green tongue.
  Although most people regard Hansel and Gretel as a children's piece, (and it is a lovely way to introduce children to the world of opera) the orchestration is so lush and rich that people of all ages will find themselves saying, ""I thought it was kids' music, but it's so beautiful.""  This music was written by Humperdinck, who might be considered the heir to the sound of Mahler, and his music is as gorgeous as a Mahler symphony.
  Yes, this production is performed in English instead of the original German language, but perhaps that makes it a better vehicle to interest new-comers to opera.
  Buy it, enjoy it, and share it with those you love!",1070755200,70,1359,4.703389830508475
7806781,5,6300217620,"Humperdinck's Hansel and Gretel is what I like to call a Wagnerian operetta. There's some of the Romantic Wagnerian orchestration and gravitas, but there's also plenty of lightness and of course, waltzes. It's a delightful work and personally my favorite of the perennial ""Christmas"" presentations opera houses like to give.

This performance is from 1982 and is the older Merrill/O'Hearn production. It's very picturesque. The Met has since replaced it with the somewhat surreal, frightening Richard Jones production. I love the Jones production but the Merrill/O'Hearn production has its old-fashioned, gentle charm. What's more, the vocal performances here are superior to the Jones DVD. It's common for a Hansel to get overshadowed by Gretel but Frederica von Stade is so lovely and gentle as Hansel and her prayer is beautiful. Judith Blegen in close-ups is a little mature looking for Gretel but she sings wonderfully. A real lyric soubrette voice. The siblings are very cute together. The witch is played here by a mezzo (Rosalind Elias) instead of a tenor in the Jones production. I prefer a mezzo playing the witch because the Witch seems more like a traditional mezzo role, much like Jezibaba or Ulrica.

Anyway this is a lovely treat, Christmas or no Christmas. Highly recommended and one of the best videos the Met put out in the 1980's.",1514505600,2,1349,5.099547511312217

7806783,5,6300217620,"Delightful.  A couple of hours of pure pleasure.  Frederika von Stade was a bit too old to be playing Hansel and  didn't have convincing moves as a young boy, but I was quite happy to shut my eyes for a few moments and enjoy her voice.  Rosalind Elias is the witchiest witch I have seen in the role since Maureen Forrester. Marvelous.",1504051200,,334,4.338709677419355
7806784,5,6300217620,"It seems like ""magical"" is a word only used by hack reviewers from suspicious-sounding newspapers. But really, there's no better word for this production. The richly romantic score is wonderfully played by the orchestra, and sensitively conducted by Fulton. The singers are uniformly good. The fantasy elements are spectacular... the house, the forest, the flying of angels and witches add immeasurably to the production. The only thing that I wasn't overly fond of was at certain moments the production was ""childrened down,"" like with the occasional addition of somewhat corny graphics. But much better than some productions that remove anything ""dangerous"" at all, and have the witch played by a man as a drag queen! All in all this is a wonderful production of a wonderful opera. You'll be whistling the folksy score for days, and that haunting, meltingly beautiful prayer will stick with you for a long time.",1502064000,,913,5.134228187919463
