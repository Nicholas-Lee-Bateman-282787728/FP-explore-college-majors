8519563,4,B007MS6NNG,The movie is kind of odd but the scenery is spectacular.  I've been going to this part of Colorado for years and knew this movie was made there in the early 50's but just lucked into finding it on line.,1413072000,,202,4.05
8519564,5,B007MS6NNG,"Every now and then along comes a film that surprises and delights a cynical old hound like me. I knew this film existed , but never having seen it, and these MGM Made to Order are not cheap, I was a bit cautious. I need not have worried. Whilst perhaps no ""High Sierra"" (it has some similarities), this is a first rate, unpretentious, well written, photographed, directed, and acted ""B"" picture, the like of which don't come along very often. From the first frame to the last it moves at a good pace with some good dialogue. It's only at the end that you realise there hasn't been much action, and you didn't notice or care. What makes this such a personal pleasure is the cast. I am not familiar with DOris Dowling, but she is terrific - a bit like Carole Matthews at her best - in her top billed role as a feisty rather butch woman ""of some mystery"" - great stuff. Then there is Richard Reeves - a great ""heavy"" of many years who has what must be his best (certainly his biggest) role ever. Artheur Franz gets a chance to really act and let rip. Fans of Myron Healy might be a bit disapointed. Please don't overlook the fact this is still a ""B"" picture but for fans of that something a bit different - Highly recomended. Excellent Wide Screen Print, Colour and Sound. Costly - Yes, but worth a go.",1358812800,3,1299,4.3061224489795915
8519565,4,B007MS6NNG,"This movie was first released in 1956(2012), in Widescreen 1.85, colour by Deluxe and runs for 83 minutes. The sound and picture quality are good, considering the DVD is made from best material available. The only extra is a WS short Trailer.
The film starts with Jains(RICHARD REEVES) shooting a running prisoner. The warden of the jail checks the dead body. A spotter plane was looking for the other 3 convicts who had escaped. Sheriff Scot(ARTHUR FRANZ) hates all this killing. Smithy(DORIS DOWLING) had come along because her rifle had been taken, as they robbed her at her filling station and she knew the range. Sheriff thinks the prisoners would head for the forests and the mountains. The warden leaves the radio with sheriff. The posse follow the foot spoors of the prisoners and come near an abandoned mine. Jains sees 2 prisoners with his telescope. The posse follow on foot and arrive at the mine buildings, but there is no one there, except rats. Sheriff thinks the 3rd convict Marty Kego, who had killed 2 cops, had gone on his own, up the mountains. Next day, they loose a horse and radio, when the horse falls off the cliffs. The posse surround the rangers hut and arrest one convict with busted leg and hand. The other 2 could be heading for the highway and they have a rifle.
This good story of STEVE FRAZEE is beautifully photographed by LESTER SHORR and well directed by MARWIN R WEINSTEIN. The action scenes are good. All actors give good performances.
DORIS DOWLING was born on 15.5.1923, in Detroit, Michigan. She followed her sister Constance to Hollywood. Her debut was in 1945. After the war, she went to Italy to revive her career. She was married 3 times and had 1 son 'Jonathan' with Artie Shaw. She died, aged 81, on 18.6.2004, in Los Angeles, California.",1353628800,4,1785,4.706070287539936
