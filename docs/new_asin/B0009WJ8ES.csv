(However, I haven't yet read all of the subtitles, and my knowledge of Polish is not so good, so some of the dialogue may have been less than great, for all I know).",1391472000,,318,4.096774193548387

speak and understand Polish.",1364774400,,153,4.464285714285714
8068323,2,B0009WJ8ES,"Heavenly bureaucrats believe angel Giordono (Krzysztof Globisz) is hanging around unsavory types in Purgatory too much so they send him off to Earth to assist the struggling humans. Giordono arrives in Poland and takes immediate and great delight in earthly pleasures which humans take for granted. In Krakow he meets up with a comically crazy homeless guy (Krakow theater legend, Jerzy Trela) who hooks him up with a single mother, Hanka (Ewa Kaim). A friendship ensues but Hanka suddenly passes away leaving Giordono to take care of her son.

Polish comedy, Angel in Krakow (Aniol w Krakowie) (2002), is the directing debut of Artur Wiecek. This film has a few enjoyable moments but the main storyline is far too underdeveloped. As the closing credits roll viewers will ask, Is that it? The 2005 sequel, Angel in Love, is definitely a more entertaining and accomplished effort.",1361664000,,879,5.062068965517241
