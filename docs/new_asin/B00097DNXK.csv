2270539,5,B00097DNXK,"I prefer learning the underlying muscle control in bellydance moves via Sadie's DVDs but I was missing something of the enjoyment through putting the moves together in a fluid way. Having tried this DVD out a few times, I'm surprised there aren't more reviews for a quietly packed DVD. I really like Luscious and Love Potion as my more dancey DVDs, and quite like Neon as an instructor. Not keen on her instant bellydancer series but her presentation style in luscious persuaded me to give this a go. I think those who enjoyed working with Luscious will really like this, although this DVD seems less structured, which works better for me. It involves the more curvy movements and putting these togther. Teaches basic moves and combinations really well, then adds layering - one move, slowly, then repeated, then additions of arm patterns and steps and variations. Lovely. Taught and builds in a way that doesn't leave me thinking 'it's suddenly jumped in difficulty level'.

Disc 1 is divided up into `Instruction' sections numbered 1, 2, 3 etc (why didn't they give each section a title? so annoying!) and corresponding `combination/choreography' section where you practice what you learnt in various variations and combo's, plus with the relevant extract from the overall choreography. Disc 2 has the non-stop versions of the combination/choreography practice.

I've listed below what each Instruction and Combo section mainly covers; I haven't listed everything but enough to give an idea. It all sounds really random but actually flows togethe really well. Each section teaches a move slowly, then with more speed, and adds on arms, patterns/shifts. It then goes onto another couple of combinations.

1. Arms movements and patterns. Really lovely, gave me good ideas what to do with my hands. About 15 mins long, gave me one thing missing from Rachel Bryce's Arms & Posture DVD - using arms in various patterns with practice, lovely moves I've incorporated. Made me interested to look at Neon's other DVD on Body Language in Bellydance.
2. Weight shifts and steps with arm patterns
3. Hip work - hip lifts, drops, twists, combined together and layered with arm patterns
4. Hip circles - large, 3-step turns with arms, 1-hip circles and combinations
5. Snake arms with weight shifts, arabesques, hip semi-circles and shoulder pushes and chest lifts
6. Hip and chest shimmies, Hip circles with torso drops, hip pushes and variations, cobo's including step hip lifts and hip pushes and different arms patterns
7. Hip semi circle and torso drops, vertical hip and chest circles, undulations (with chest lifts and one on leg) sways, also layered
8. Mayas with variations and combinations, reverse undulations, maya combos, chest slides and circles

While some sections build upon each other, there is flexibility to dive straight into specific sections. It would also be helpful to have an understanding of the basic bellydance movements to get the most enjoyment out of it but it is designed for beginners so not a problem if you are - there are lots of things to get out of this DVD. As another reviewer says, Neon does provide a lot of thoughtful narrative, all relevant that adds to the learning of the move/combo. I really like that it teaches the move, adds on foot patterns, arms movements, weight shifts, so means I can get a lot of use out of this DVD as I master the basic moves and can add another layer to it. Advanced bellydancers might not get too much out of this, but for those home-taught bellydances, beginners and advanced beginners (I'm floating somewhere between the last two depending on the move) it provides a gorgeous looking, calm and thorough lesson in the basics and combinations and layering.

Costuming is lovely, the music in section 4 is terrible, seriously, truly awful, but the rest is ok. Couple of cheesey moves thrown in but as a whole, very elegant, languid combinations that are extremely graceful. One of the only DVDs I have that teaches the slower, more seductive and playful side of bellydance moves. Also very tasteful. No warm up/cooldown so make sure you do beforehand as there will be lots of stretching around the hip and oblique areas. As the moves are generally executed at a slower pace (although it does speed up at times), this involves more muscle control so good for the toning! Limited selection of good Bellydance tutorial and practice DVDs in the UK, so I keep my eyes peeled for gems overseas - this is one of them! Seriously, only 3 other reviews...but it's SOOOOOOO good!...",1339891200,37,4535,4.930628272251309
2270540,5,B00097DNXK,"Perfect for learning evocative and expressive movements, this DVD 2-set is not just for beginners. Neon covers beautiful arm movements, incorporating bellydance moves in a way that builds confidence. In my opinion, this DVD lives up to its title. Everything is planned out to help you learn and enhance the grace of emotive movements. Most movements are more languid than energetic, which is helpful for perfecting your technique and also good for toning the body. The costuming of the dancers is appropriate for seeing leg movements clearly. Most of the music is good enough to add to your own music library, if it were available in longer versions. I did miss having a professional performance included, though. I always look forward to seeing the instructor perform.

Minor complaints: I think simplified cues would work better in the choreography. There was too much instruction, really, for that section. I prefer to have all the detailed instruction in the practice sessions. Also, the video editing was a bit choppy at times. I would rather have Neon continuously show me the flow sessions instead of having each section replayed over and over. I like to notice nuances as she repeats the movements herself instead of having a video editor chop it up and rehash it.

One major complaint: For some reason, Disk 2 just simply stops after the choreography. It stops and will not allow you to play the DVD. I had to actually eject it and put it in again in order to get it to play again. Whoever programmed the DVD made a major blunder. The video sequence should always return to either the main menu or a submenu when finished. It certainly should not quit out and keep you from playing the DVD altogether unless you eject it and insert it again.

Still, whether you are a beginner or a skilled dancer, this DVD set is worth owning. You will pick up some wonderful arm movements to incorporate with your dance steps.",1332979200,16,1920,4.77710843373494
2270541,5,B00097DNXK,"My friends and fellow dancers, as well as I, have immensley enjoyed learning the choreography from this instructional DVD. We feel that it has enriched and improved arm articulation and overal, especially pleasing are the rewarding benefits in expressivity, and the feminine quality of expression.

Although the program is titled for beginners, there is always much to learn from Neon's tremendous work.  This program combines the beautiful, expressive movement that adds drama to belly dance. The beginner dancer can quickly adapt from open arms frame and begin expressive movement, such as the deceiving languidness of the upper body, the feathery hand flourishes, and the fluidity of the arms.

 Neon's narration of every sequence allows one to savor every embellishment, and every adjective that recreates symmetry from common movement into graceful dance. Her instruction is clear and precise during the voice cues, gving much attention to important details such as posture, which is a key element in keeping a regal look throughout the dance.

I love this entire program, and especially the set up. The program is generously divided into two discs to facilitate learning. It would be difficult to elaborate every gesture in the program since it abundantly packed with lovely movment. The choreography is divided into eight sections, rich in combinations easy enough for the beginner and the seasoned dancer.  The upper body expression is set on lovely hip circles, three point turns, arabesques, undulations, just to name a few. Learning the choreography is one goal, however, the ultimate goal here is to fine tune all the lovely movement as gracefully as Neon.

 So much varied and beautiful movement can easily be adapted to different types of music, as is one of the lessons to be learned here.",1331683200,5,1804,5.217993079584775
2270542,5,B00097DNXK,"This is an instructional DVD by Neon, for beginners.  Neon is lovely to look at, fascinating to watch, and she gives clear instruction.  You will begin by learning sinuous arm movements, then you will learn to layer those with belly dance moves and foot patterns.  All this is to music right off the bat, so you are dancing right away.  Neon gives key tips that will help you maintain posture and elegance.  When you hear these key tips, I recommend writing them on a post-it and putting it next to your practice mirror!  The DVD allows you to follow the choreography with voice notes or without voice notes.  Some new dancers tend to rush, rush, rush, and try to hit every beat in a song.  If you notice that you do that, work with this DVD to help you slow down.  This is the place to start for the pretty side of belly dance.
There is a lot of information on this DVD that is not OVERTLY presented, so, do, please, listen carefully to what she presents. In other words, she doesn't beat you over the head with the information, it is just there.  If you need to be beaten over the head, attend a live dance class and let your instructor know that need! (It is good to know these things about yourself, and share it so you can improve!)
You will get a nice, long workover (this is 2 DVDs) from your fingers to toes learning the sensuous side of belly dance.",1331510400,24,1358,4.311023622047244

2270554,1,B00097DNXK,This is not for beginners. From  The first lesson  it is complicated arm movements at full speed with steps. not enough breakdown for a beginner. I've had lessons and I find this too fast.,1450051200,,188,4.5
2270555,5,B00097DNXK,"I LOVE this! For the ones saying it's not for beginners...it definitely is! I find she goes through each step thoroughly...and I can easily follow. I don't find it THAT hard. It makes me feel graceful and actually confident in myself, in which I am usually not. I totally recommend this!

EDIT: I believe the ones saying that it was too fast and that she did not explain accidentally put the second disc in. That's the disc you use after you've learned the choreography in the first disc. The first disc is the one with the main directions and slow movements.",1441497600,5,559,4.534653465346534

2270560,1,B00097DNXK,I have been interested in learning how to belly dance and since this DVD specifies it was for beginners I thought it would help me get into it. Unfortunately this is for those who casually belly dance but not for new learners. The minute the lesson starts the moves are continuous so you can learn step by step. The lesson goes way to fast. The narrator seems like she can barely keep up. I think this more focuses on those learning to do choreography for belly dance. One part shows the moves for the dance and the next part puts the moves together to form a full dance. I wish it was useful for me to learn the basics but it's too advanced for me.,1431302400,,649,4.2

2270576,3,B00097DNXK,"For beginners, she speaks and moves much too fast. Also, for more difficult moves such as the first 'hand flip and rotate move,' for example, a beginner would need the instructor to slow down even more at that particular point and perhaps show it 2 or three times. I would pay extra for that! If this DVD set had done that, I would have rated it a solid five.

However, I'm still giving it a 3 because the DVD set packaging, dance setting, costumes, dancers and instruction are otherwise excellent, in my opinion.",1404604800,,513,4.516129032258065
2270577,5,B00097DNXK,I'm starting dance again after several months and my daughters want to learn with me. This video's walk through of all the moves helped me pick up where I left off as well as helping my girls learn each individual move.,1399852800,,219,4.365853658536586
2270578,3,B00097DNXK,"I am a little disappointed with this DVD. Based on the reviews I must have had high expectations. I don't like the visual or the instructions. Even though it says ""beginners"" the voice giving the instructions speaks way too fast to understand what to do. I basically just made it my own way. Despite instruction problems, I was really surprised that I felt the workout. Even just doing it in small amounts I guess from the repitive practice my muscles were getting worked. Overall,I'm not very engaged in the DVD, but it does make you work. I just thought it would be more exciting.",1391817600,2,582,4.605769230769231

2270580,3,B00097DNXK,This is not a bad tutorial.  I just can't keep up.  If you have better hand eye coordination than I do you'll probably enjoy this dvd. I will say that my arms definitely felt workedout when I was done.,1387670400,2,201,4.128205128205129
2270581,5,B00097DNXK,I'll start by saying I've never had classes. I never plan to as I never plan to perform and I do this solely for enjoyment. Neon doesn't break down form and she is wearing slightly obscuring pants. And the menu could be a little better sometimes hard to tell which number you're about to click. That stuff aside this is a good get up and dance instructional she moves gracefully and I felt she was easy to follow.,1382313600,3,413,4.3076923076923075

2270600,4,B00097DNXK,I have been slowly working my way through this DVD and so far I am really loving it :) The instruction is pretty easy to follow and the moves are really sensual. My only gripe would to ask that they show more of what the leg movements look like during hip movement so that we can see exactly what we are supposed to be doing with our knees.,1366156800,3,340,4.014705882352941

There is no ""Step 1: Raise your arms slowly and step back. Step 2: cross hands over your heart... etc."" She just does it at full speed right off the bat.

If you are an absolute beginner, do -NOT- get this. Go with Belly Dance for Beginners. She actually tells you what you're doing and, *GASP!* how to do it.",1350259200,13,451,4.125
2270609,5,B00097DNXK,"I have been taking lessons for a little over a year with a great teacher, so I have been looking for a dvd that does a little more than just go over the basic moves, with out being overly complicated. I love this one because it actually has you dancing to the beat of the music, and ohhhhh what lovely arms.  I think arms and hands make the dance, and there is precious little out there that teaches you anything about them.  I even bought ""All about Arms with Ruby, and went away feeling like I didn't learn much.  This video, isn't supposed to be just about arms, but it does teach you some very graceful arm movements. The whole choreography is quite beautiful, and just perfect for my level of dance.  Now, Probably alot of others just starting could also master this, but, I did better off with a teacher telling me correct form and practicing with Layia and Sadie on tape,to start off with.  I also have ""Lusious"".  That is quite good also, but I wasn't as impressed with Neon in it.  I kept comparing her to Blanca. Blanca is so much more sensual, than Neon.  But I've come to appreciate Neon more in this one. True, I still think Blanca more sensuous, but now I have come to realize Neon is just very dramatic.  Drama is good in belly dance. Just another way of dancing.  Ohhhh if only I could be a cross somewhere between the two of them. Also I just wanted to mention, Neon is a wonderful teacher,  she goes step by step and gets it in your muscle memory. None of that break neck speed some of the other videos have.  The whole thing is set up quite easy to navigate.""I really like the two dvd set, where after you've learned the moves on the first dvd, you can practice better on 2. I have to agree with another reviewer who said she overly does the cues.  You can't possibly take in all those cues as you dance.  But oh well, you can also play the one without the cues.  All in all this is a great dvd.  Fantastic for the money.  Really glad I purchased it.",1350000000,,1969,4.2359249329758715

8058350,5,B00097DNXK,"I would say this is Neons Masterpiece! This is the culmination of Neons teaching approach, meaning dancing from the very first step for beginners.  It is not for total beginners though (lets say not for your very first week), but the way it is set up, starting with arm movements and poses in the first 3 sections (combined with very few foot steps) allows a beginner to be gently introduced to bellydance. Her explanations and tutorial are more thorough in Love potion, but here everything is weaved together in a single work of art: instruction, practice and choreography. I thought I would not like doing theatrical poses (I do not aim at performing, I just bellydance as part of my dance based workouts in order to get some exercise). But to my surprise I liked it, a lot, the whole routine flows naturally and it feels good. I think the arm movements are even a good workout, my arms were aching after some time during first sections and my heart rate also went up a bit. I do not know if you can get toned by just dancing, but it is exercising and it is fun. Finally I need to say that this is not a piece of cake, this is the entire cake!!! If you do the first DVD from beginning to end it is more than 2 and a half hours of dancing.

EXCELLENT BD DVD'S FOR TOTAL BEGINNERS. I may have other beginner DVD's, but the following are my top picks because all include a detailed tutorial section that break down the moves slowly and without music. Of course tutorials are boring, specially if you are not totally new to BD or if you prefer to learn by dancing from the very first step. However, if you are an absolute beginner in BD, you probably need this instruction, since you need to isolate a lot of muscles you did not even know you could voluntarily move.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belly-Dance-Basics-Beyond-with-Jenna-Belly-Dancing-Classes-for-a-Solid-Foundation-Bellydance-how-to-belly-dance-technique/dp/B000FSL8WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belly Dance Basics & Beyond, with Jenna: Belly Dancing Classes for a Solid Foundation - Bellydance how-to, belly dance technique</a>&nbsp;will provide you one of the most detailed technique sections you will find and probably the most complete one in terms of variety of moves.

Sandra first explains each move, including muscular engagement, posture, etc. without music and also giving you truly interesting background information as to how the move is executed in ""Middle Eastern Dance"" vs other dance forms like ""African"", ""Jazz"", etc. Then she drills each move with excellent drum music, making your drilling much more fun so you do not get bored so easily. However, you would need to buy Vol 1 and 2 and still don't get as many moves as with Jenna.

CARDIO CHALLENGE: Low to medium TONING: Low CHOREOGRAPHY DIFFICULTY: Beginner to Intermediate INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY: Very Good MUSIC: Very Good FUN FACTOR: Very good

CONTENTS:
DVD 1 is divided into 8 segments. However, each segment consists of instruction, practice and choreography, so in fact there are three different parts for each segment, each part with different music and costume.
  a) In the instruction Neon explains each bellydance move slowly, then she drills it first slowly and then at full speed. Then she combines a few moves into a small combination and then she drills the combinations first slowly and then at full speed.
  b) The practice flow takes the combinations from the instruction and puts them into a small choreographed dance flow which is performed by three dancers in full costume. This practice flow is repeated aprox. five times with the same piece of music. The 8 small segments form an entire choreography.
  c) The choreography takes exactly the same choreographed combinations from the practice flow but to a different song. The choreography is performed by the three dancers in a different costume and it is only repeated twice. In general terms, this song goes faster than the practice flow song, so its the same a tiny bit faster.

Customizable training: The instruction and the practice and choreography are separated, so you can choose segment 1 instruction only, or segment 1 practice and choreography, which practically means dancing the same combo approximately seven times one after the other. If you let it just run it will give you segment 1 - instruction, practice and choreography, followed by segment 2 -instruction, practice and choreography.

DVD 2 is presented as two full choreographies, first the dance flow (with and without voice cues) and then the choreography (with and without voice cues). So basically here you can dance the 8 segments one after the other in a full choreopraphy.

MUSIC:
Very nice contemporary music selections without lyrics, so you can concentrate on your moves.

EMPHASIS:
The emphasis is I would say in learning and drilling a full bellydance choreography with theatrical arm movements, poses and gestures.

WHAT IS BETTER THAN IN OTHER DVD'S:
+ The artistry behind the DVD. Everything looks beautiful.
+ Expressive arm trayectories and poses, that are easy to learn for a beginner and that immediately rise the beauty of the choreography.
+ The combinations are not too difficult (not too much layering) and flow smoothly, so they are doable by a beginner, but there are a lot of nuances and expressions, so that it looks like a top performance.
+ Excellent cues and tips for achieving expressive movement, from head tilts to where you should be looking at (for example, you should look for direct eye contact with your audience in some parts, while you avoid eye contact in others, where you want to convey a dreamy expression).
+ Extensive coverage of various bellydance moves and a few travel steps and turns.
+ You learn a full extensive choreography, and then you can take advantage of having learned it by having two different songs to which you can perform it.
+ It is a very good workout, especially your arms will be aching and you even elevate your heart rate a bit.
+ It is fun to do. The movements are not repeated like in a dance workout, they are varied like in a real choreography, but since each segment is danced several times, you get to learn the choreography (including myself  to my surprise).
+ Customizable training: The tutorial and the practice and choreography, have also been built together, so you can decide how to use them, depending on your preferred learning process.",1487203200,,8308,5.550552922590837
