8307584,4,B001H0C9S8,"The Final Winter gives a wholehearted Australian Rugby League story, which is engaging and quite well presented.

Australia doesn't produce many sports films, which is at odds with Australia's sports crazy culture. This movie gives an accurate insight into a time when rugby league players had day jobs, and having a beer after training or a game was the 1980s Aussie version of Gatorade.

The competitive spirit and team mateship of rugby league is well conveyed in this film.

8307585,5,B001H0C9S8,"I simply loved this film!  It's a wonderful story of human emotions set against the background of a semi-professional football team in Sydney in the 1980s.

Sport has changed immensely over the last twenty years.  Amateur and semi-professional sport has given way to full time professionals.  Yet, in the process, something has gone missing.  Where is the tribal passion that used to abound?  So much of this has given way to the pursuit of money while the team supporter is left wondering where he or she fits in.

""The Final Winter"" is set against the backdrop of the Newtown Jets, a struggling Rugby League football club in inner Sydney.  ""Grub"" Henderson is the team captain and something of a dinosaur.  He belongs to the days before television was able to rub out violence from the code.  He is a man whose time is up.  Yet, he is also a man of great passion and loyalty.  There is little that he wouldn't do for his team on the field; even if this means attacking his own brother on a competing team.

Everything seems to be stacked against ""Grub"".  The system is determined to snuff him out of the game.  But, in the end, there is a wonderful coming together of several of the film's protagonists.  The viewer is left with a warm inner glow.  Sport is the ultimate reality TV!  Do not miss this film!",1230854400,2,1308,4.517094017094017
