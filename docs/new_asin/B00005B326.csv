7936539,5,B00005B326,Great Video for kids.  The actor was wonderful and the story endearing. I show it every year to my 5th and 6th grade students! This series is wonderful!!,1426377600,,153,4.464285714285714
7936540,1,B00005B326,"I don't mind blending a little fiction with a bit of science to make an interesting movie, but when you are making a biography of Einstein, it would be nice to at least get the explanation of E=mc2 right.  In the movie it says that he proved mathematically that if mass moves at the speed of light squared it turns into energy!  AARRGGHH! Just for the record, according to Einstein, nothing goes faster than the speed of light.",1146096000,4,427,4.461538461538462

7936542,5,B00005B326,"I was extremely pleased with how my 10 and 12 year old daughters were fascinated with this video.  This video teaches about a love for learning.  Teaches not only a bit of history mixed with fiction (I think Lannie is  fictional), but teaches Math and Science as well.  Excellent for ages 9-up.  Not a factual account of Einstein's theories, but a delightful insight.",948672000,6,367,4.761904761904762
