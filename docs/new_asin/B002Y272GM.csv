It's all about radical authenticity, self-knowledge, self-trust, openness and communication skills.  I highly recommend this gem to anyone that is called to see their relationship(s) as a laboratory and are vested in their personal growth.  The material is rich and it's presented in a light hearted manner, so it's really fun to watch, too.",1334534400,,478,5.089743589743589
8383994,5,B002Y272GM,"This DVD has a ton of great material for everyday people as well as the folks who are into Poly and or Tantra.  The base principles are delivered in a fun and humorous way that helps cement the ideas into my head as I work on my short comings.
There should be a workshop based on this material as a pre-requisite to marriage, then we might have fewer failed relationships and a lot more happy folks in healthy relationships.

Check it out, it's really worth your time.

8383995,5,B002Y272GM,"As a woman who has spent the last 30 years of her life married and practicing monogamy I feel I can speak in a real way to sexual repression and the surrendering of autonomy.
 Discovering Kamala and REiD has guided me towards a path of consciousness, grace, empowerment, and spirituality within myself that reflects far beyond my love lives into my everyday being.
Practicing non-monogamy has freed me to be authentic and passionate.  This DVD helps me to remember my story is not unique and I am not alone.  Offers a resource to tap into when I need validation for my feelings, direction for my emotions, and exercises to get me out of self and into action.",1265068800,,658,4.6068376068376065
8383996,5,B002Y272GM,"There are far too few films about polyamory. Kamala Devi and Reid Mihalko obviously are drawing from a wealth of experience. I must admit that I almost did not buy the DVD because the title made it seem like a joke, but despite the humor from Mihalko throughout, this film is packed with serious relationship strategies that I have never found anywhere else. I wholeheartely recommend this film for anyone who wants to have more than one relationship, and especially to those people who are cheating on their partners. There truly is a better way.",1264982400,2,547,4.768421052631579
8383997,4,B002Y272GM,"As a sex educator, I regularly share tools for improving relationships with better communication skills. Thanks to this dvd, I now have really powerful tools for creating awareness and clarity regarding what I want to communicate to someone else BEFORE I speak. This is invaluable information for every relationship I have!

I'm personally very thankful for all I've learned from both Kamala and Reid regarding open relationships. Now the whole world has an opportunity to learn from them as well and I have even more tools to share. Do yourself a favor and BUY this dvd. You'll be glad you did!",1261612800,,595,4.891089108910891
8383998,5,B002Y272GM,"Reid and Kamala are fun, witty, and very informative.  I learned so much about how to be a better lover and partner from paying attention to their steps.  The info is presented in an accessible, non-threatening and entertaining way.  Reid is hilarious (and rather irreverent, be warned).  This is a great thing to watch with partners or alone to prepare yourself for a great, ethical and honest relationship.",1261440000,,408,4.955882352941177
8383999,5,B002Y272GM,"I'm a self-help junkie and that extends to podcasts and DVDs. I want to be the best person I can be. Lately I've been learning a lot about relationships and how to make them work, as well as my role in said relationships. This DVD offers a fresh, honest and out-of-the ordinary look at how to master romantic partnerships.

 But wait, this isn't just your regular feel-good collection of mumbo-jumbo marriage therapy diced and sliced into bites of information. Rather, this DVD explores real-world issues in a way you've probably never considered. Or if you have, you might have felt bad about it or thought you were alone. While Earning Your Black Belt in Relationships focuses mainly on how to make polyamorous--or ""open""--relationships work, the ideas presented are excellent tools for any relationship. Even single people can take the ideas and apply them to their lives. The best viewer for this DVD isn't someone who's solely interested or labeled as polyamorous, but rather someone who is tired of making the same mistakes and wants to delve into different ways of thinking and being that actually work.

Sex and relationship coaches Kamala Devi and Reid Mihalko share tools and tricks to successfully sustaining multiple open relationships. That's right, more than one. And guess what? If you can't get one right, it's not likely you'll be able to get more than one right. So start small and blossom as your communication and awareness skills grow.

There are 10 chapters in this DVD, and the ""lessons"" spell out BLACKBELTS, which also echoes a fun ninja theme (it's subtle, but clever). Mihalko and Devi explore the lessons in detail after you watch intriguing, real-life footage about the topic from people who live it. And no, not everyone is labeled as strictly polyamorous. One person is single and ""poly-curious."" Another is monogamous but open-minded. Each topic ends with an exercise or ""mission"" to help anchor the ideas presented. Here's a peek into the chapters:

1. Be Real: learn to be transparent - This chapter stresses how important it is to know who you are and what you really need. This is easier said than done, as many people live in a fog much of their lives. So before you do anything, get in touch with your authentic self.

2. Labels and Lovestyles: define your own terms - Figure out what works for you in relationship. Be specific and know that there are many different ""fits"" or ""configurations."" You may even choose to not label yourself, but know that you still need to be able to communicate your needs, and words might be necessary.

3. Agreements and Boundaries: authentic negotiations - This chapter explores the importance of setting clear agreements and boundaries. Communication and transparency are the keywords here. When you know what works for you and you ask for what you need to feel safe, you create more freedom. These can evolve over time. The ""mission"" here is to determine what your bottom line is.

4. Clear Communication: express yourself fully - Without clear communication, you are not going to make it. If you like to withhold information or if you are unable to listen to and hear your partner, you have work to do. Develop your ability to speak your truth and hear your partner. Say what's not being said.

5. Know your needs: and how to get them met - This chapter talks about ""needs work,"" which is pretty deep emotional work. You are in charge of your own needs. Be aware of what your needs are and meet them in a healthy way--needs aren't bad. Use the communication skills you learned in previous chapters.

6. Break-ups and Transitions: let go with grace - Change is inevitable and break-ups aren't necessarily bad. Longevity is a ""horrible metric with which to measure the quality of a relationship."" Relationships are organic and seasonal. Be realistic about what's healthy.

7. Emotions are Welcome: honor your feelings - Believe it or not, it is all right to feel whatever it is you are feeling. Be willing to express yourself and be willing to hold space for your partnerships. Emotions are meant to be felt. You can raise your emotional intelligence and apply it to your relationships.

8. Learning Curve: give yourself room to grow - This chapter normalizes the time it takes to get things ""right."" Be gentle with yourself and see relationships as growth opportunities. Don't try to be perfect. Expect breakdowns and work with them. Welcome the learning curve, learn and apply the lessons.

9. Takes a Tribe: creating alternative community - Surround yourself with support, community or tribe. Don't isolate yourself. This can be online, a potluck, church, whatever works for you.

10. Sex and Spirituality: honoring your lovers and self - Approach your relationships with a sacredness and respect, regardless of whether or not it's ""mystical."" Elevate it to a higher co-creation. Be free from guilt, shame and fear.

Devi and Mihalko are real and engaging, and their down-to-earth rapport is charming. While the camera work is a little shaky at times, the content is so strong and the advice so compelling, it's easy to forgive. Get ready to open your mind and your heart with this entertaining, educational and endearing DVD.",1260921600,4,5202,4.902161547212741
