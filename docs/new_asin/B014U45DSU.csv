7424738,5,B014U45DSU,"How often do you see a movie devoted to poetry? Answer: this film may be the only one that exists to see. It's devoted to poetry in the sense that the film is an outright vehicle for the reading of several of Kahlil Gibran's more beautiful poems. That will be interesting to some, but at the same time the poetry reading is woven the into context of a delightful story of a poet that stands against the foolishness of the world and a charming child who reaches beyond herself to stand with him. It's a warming highest-quality family entertainment delivery of these poems that go so far beyond the ordinary mind that the adult will be elevated in ways very unexpected if he or she just listens to the words.",1444003200,26,706,4.438461538461539
7424739,5,B014U45DSU,Beautiful and meaningful. Very moving. Wonderful for both children and adults.,1443484800,15,78,6.181818181818182
7424740,5,B014U45DSU,Charming movie packed full of mystical poetry gifted from the soul of the Universe through the writings of Kahlil Gibran.,1442793600,6,121,5.1

7424742,5,B014U45DSU,"This is an artistic account of the Gibran writings. It was interesting to have a variety of artists doing individual sections. Beautifly done.
Not everyone will understand.  I was the only person in the theater.",1441497600,11,211,5.0285714285714285
7424743,3,B014U45DSU,"Directed by Rogers Allers (The Lion King) who also wrote the screenplay, The Prophet is an attempted adaptation of the classic book of the same name by Kahlil Gibran. Emphasis being on the word ""attempted"" as the film does not stand up well on its own.

On the plus side, several different animators - some veterans and some up and coming - were given the task of animating various sequences in the film, the ones centered around Gibran's poetic musings from the book. These animators - Gatan and Paul Brizzi (various Disney films), Mohammed Saeed Harib, Tomm Moore (The Secret of Kells, Song of the Sea), Nina Paley (Sita Sings the Blues), Bill Plympton (Guard Dog, Your Face), Joann Sfar (The Rabbi's Cat) and Michal Socha (Laska) give the film its moments of grace and beauty, taking Gibran's words and using them to inspire the visual palette with which they are accompanied on the screen.

The problem - and it's not an insignificant one - is the clumsy and overly message-laden framing story that surrounds these moments of grace and beauty. In a small coastal town somewhere in the Ottoman Empire before WWI, an artist/poet/philosopher named Mustafa (Liam Neeson) is kept under a kind of house arrest by the local Pasha (Frank Langella). His only visitors are his housekeeper Kamila (Salma Hayek) and her seemingly mute daughter Almitra (Quvenzhan Wallis). The reasons for his confinement are left vague, with hints that somehow his writings are deemed suspect by the Ottoman government that wants him to repudiate them before they'll set him free. Which Mustafa refuses to do, spending his time instead behaving like an unworldly saint with no concerns for himself, periodically launching into one of his musings or poems on the nature of life, humanity, mortality and everything else. So much so that Mustafa never comes across as a real character, only as a narrative device. The local authorities are either thuggish or clownish, and the townspeople mere clay waiting to be enlightened by Mustafa's words of wisdom.  There's not a lot of subtlety going on, like when Almitra says to her mother Mommy, you cant be killed just for writing something, can you? just in case the viewer has somehow missed the point.

And then there's the pacing, which moves so slowly at times that one struggles to stay awake, a task which is made an even harder challenge by Gabriel Yared (The English Patient, The Talented Mr. Ripley) 's unrelentingly syrupy score.

Recommended for fans of animation and for its renditions of some of Gibran's essays that fans may find beautifully done, but not as a film to be seen in its own right.",1441497600,16,2626,4.865771812080537
7424744,5,B014U45DSU,This film was beautifully crafted. It made me cry in the right way to hear this poetry coupled with the dramatic images. I highly recommend it!!!,1515024000,,145,4.615384615384615

7424746,5,B014U45DSU,"From an animation standpoint, this is a great collaboration. Tom Moore and Bill Plympton lent their talents to create moving pictures that depicted Gibran's timeless poetry.

The story that gave the poetry context was equally beautiful parable of honesty, grief and friendship.

Most importantly, this does justice to the poetry of Kahlil Gibran. Liam Neeson's silky voice brings the words to life.

This is worth owning as well as watching. Also, the soundtrack is also worth owning.",1508889600,,484,5.259740259740259
7424747,5,B014U45DSU,This was wonderful. I have long been a fan of Gibran and this was a refreshing way to celebrate that - plus it finally put Kahlil's words into my husband's ear. Lovely animation - altogether a very worthwhile film.,1507420800,,214,4.512820512820513

7424761,2,B014U45DSU,"Take the time and read the book. The book is well segmented and enriching. This movie just feels like they took the books segments and mashed them together to try and for a coherent story line that comes across as neither compelling, nor intelligent, nor entertaining.",1484352000,3,268,4.8478260869565215

7424769,3,B014U45DSU,"The movie would be great--if the viewer had never read Gibran's works. Trying to think of his writings in this context is jarring, to say the least. The effort to make Gibran's philosophy available to today's Western audience is admirable, but it does not work as a children's movie. It might be a cartoon, but I doubt any young child would find the dissertations on abstract concepts of death, marriage, work, etc. meaningful or entertaining.",1482364800,,443,4.92
7424770,4,B014U45DSU,"Overall I enjoyed it, as a fan of the book I felt the spirit was true.  Not sure I liked the changes to Mustafa's background and ending, it seemed an unnecessarily glum change.  Just my opinion  there though.  I loved the various animations to the different poems, I wish more of them from the book could have been included.  I thought it seemed a bit disjointed at times but not enough to make me dislike it as a whole.  It's probably  not for people looking for light ""cartoon"" amusment.  Animation does not equal simple child's amusment.  This movie is deeper and more thoughtful.  As far as it's appropriateness for children it really depends on the child.  I wouldn't  recommend it for children under 13 in general but I am positive many younger children are out there who would love it.  So if you plan on showing it to a child watch it first and decide if it is something said child would enjoy.",1482105600,4,902,4.460122699386503

7424780,3,B014U45DSU,"While this adaptation is based on the popular book, it somehow feels unfinished and a little cliche. Perhaps the filmmakers relied too heavily on the international fame of this book and assumed that most of their audience had read it, and so already know the tale. Mostly what you get in this movie is Mustapa's lukewarm  'philosophy' set to music, and animation. I would have liked to see more actual character development and back story, instead of Disney villains and heroes painted wth such broad strokes that you don't really care about them. Also implausible is that an 8 year old girl would understand the concepts Mustapa presents enough to follow him around with such loyalty after one meeting. While the movie is visually lush,it sort of plays like one long music video at times, and was in spots boring. When I rented it,I was pretty sure that I would never actually own it to watch more than once.",1473292800,3,909,4.716981132075472

7424798,2,B014U45DSU,"An episodic animation anthology.

Each segment animated by a different artist which might incorporate a song or narration of 'wise' sayings by Kahlil Gibran (which may feel pretentious dependent on taste or tolerance for poetry.) As such the episodes vary in quality, but most are superior to the wraparounds segments which involve a jailed poet who is to be released after seven years captivity. A mother and little girl and a soldier go along for the ride.

The wraparounds look good, but once movement is introduced it is apparent that they are computer rendered since little effort was made to disguise the fact. This gives them a cheap feel. The introduction is a sub Disney (this was directed by the guy who directed The Lion King, who should know better) story vignette which wholly rips off Aladdin's introduction. I started singing the Street Rat song as it went along. The girl design is reminiscent of the young Tarzan's & her mom looks like Esmeralda.

The short segments use different animation techniques (there is even a Bill Plympton color pencil short.) Some are more effective than others. Some are slow and some deal in adult subject matter, marriage and such and may not be suitable for children depending on their parent's sensitivity, even thought there are no explicit images. This is not really a children's film.

Obviously, the Amazon 5 star reviews are by people who love the book, and not necessarily by people who are being objective about the actual movie. For animation or Kahlil Gibran fans.",1462147200,2,1523,4.914396887159533

Each poem has its own director and style, some parts accompanied by simple readings and others to musical adaptations, and they are pieced together by a frame narrative that carries as much philosophical value as the poems themselves. Some parts were so beautiful or poignant they had me reaching for the tissue box. Appropriate for all ages. Highly recommended!",1455580800,2,435,5.055555555555555

I was moved to tears several times.  I believe they did an amazing job of adapting the storyline to be meaningful and weaving Gibran's words throughout.  Both of my older kids wanted to read the book when we were done, and my toddler loved it too.  As a long time devotee to Gibran's poetry I'm impressed and not disappointed.",1455148800,,498,4.3478260869565215

I liked the use of animation and think it was the right choice to visually tell the story of this book, but I do think it might not be for everyone. I loved it because I love this book and poetry in general and while it is fine for children to watch I don't think it's a ""kid's movie."" I think ""On Love"" was the best musical piece and while I enjoyed the others I don't think they were done as well. It's very hard to put poetry to music sometimes but they did a great job. The animation is done beautifully.",1455148800,5,673,4.067669172932331

7424852,3,B014U45DSU,"Kahlil Gibrans 1923 collection of philosophical, poetic essays The Prophet, has since become a massive international hit. Translated into 40 languages, with millions of copies sold, the books sweeping themes of love, freedom, sorrow, religion, death  among many other deep, esoteric subjects  resonated with folks worldwide. Roger Allers animated adaptation took a risky approach and split the narrative into segments, each illustrated by a top contemporary artist, such as Bill Plympton (Idiots and Angels), Nina Paley (Sita Sings the Blues) and Tomm Moore (The Secret of Kells), all strung together  or directed  by the helmer of Open Season and The Lion King. For the most part, the effort pays off, though the film does lack coherence.

Salma Hayeks passion project  she is the lead producer, who got Liam Neeson for voicing the protagonist, came up with the idea of having separate vignettes, and voices what I assume is a Lebanese character in a blatantly Spanish accent  begins with Almitra, a young, fatherless, troublemaker girl who hasn't spoken a word since her fathers death. She upsets and alienates her village with pranks and general trouble-making, and her mom, Kamila (yep, Salma Hayek), has to defend her daughter against the frankly justified anger of the villagers. They live in the home of an imprisoned poet Mustafa (a highly elegiac Liam Neeson), where Kamila serves as his maid.

Mustafa tells Almitra hes not really a prisoner, and that hes flown away many times (followed by a short but beautiful sequence about imaginations limitlessness, and how we are spirits, free as the wind.) Yet now hes being exiled, and on their journey to a doomed ship, escorted by guards, the trio encounters a legion of thankful villagers. Mustafa is a Christ-like figure, whose poetic readings are visualized in the animated sequences, ranging from Monet-like painterly impressionist overtures to briefly outlined sketches, dazzling in their simplicity. Almitra discovers that the guards have a plan brewing, which involves having Mustafa renounce all of his creations, and she attempts to stop them. The film ends on a profound note  by far The Prophets high point.

Its genuinely refreshing to see hand-drawn animation; the warmth and artistry is palpable  but while its a joy to behold for the most part, the sketches do vary in quality, one particularly psychedelic piece resembling a trippy screen-saver. The sketch-to-sketch narrative is both exciting, as one never knows what will appear on the screen next, and off-putting, giving the film an episodic structure that doesnt flow as well as it should. The main plot, connecting Mustafas cabalistic stories together, is jarringly straightforward and sophomoric.

Which brings me to the films big flaw: its elegant, poetic, mythical, and at times passionately political narrative gets regularly interrupted by moments of juvenile humor, apparently to appease the young uns, but the flow stumbles, hard. For example, theres silly guard-chasing-bird slapstick, or a character proclaiming, for no reason: Ill stick with the baklava. (Worst punchline of 2015?) Maybe some things got lost in translation, as its an international effort; the United States, France, Lebanon, Quatar and Canada were all involved in the films production.

But does that excuse the films dearth of tonal consistency? Passages, such as For you can no longer be free, when you think of freedom as a goal, or Give your hearts, but not into each others keeping, for only the hand of life can contain your hearts are lovely sentiments that will totally go over the little heads of children amused by poop jokes. Im all about not underestimating the kids intelligence, and parents pausing the film and explaining the meaning behind each sequence, but then why bore those parents with frequent immature shenanigans and bad dialogue? In addition, while in the Gibrans book the authoritys intentions  to suppress artistic expression with despotism  were clearly defined, many kids may be left confounded as to why Mustafas harmless teachings are deemed so evil by those mean guards. Say what you want about Pixar, but they do the fine balancing act of accessible to both kids and their parents on multiple levels better than anyone else, as proven by the recent, brilliant Inside Out.

The film could have done without the musical interludes, which sound like diluted, Disney-like numbers, barely saved by the animation driving them. The Children Are Not Your Children song is particularly laughable. Again, its like the filmmakers didn't trust their instincts to stick to the darkness of the source material; imagine Persepolis with Looney Tunes interludes, and a Phil Collins soundtrack.

I realize I may have been a bit harsh on the film. A lot of care and attention went into this ambitious project, and while its not quite the masterpiece it wanted to be, and has trouble defining its audience, its a gorgeous story, with inspired passages, and certainly better than most of the computer-generated animation coming out of the Dream Factory these days. Similar in structure to the sketch-like narratives of Fantasia or Fear(s) of the Dark, its best enjoyed as a visual poem, a feast for the eyes that gets the imagination buzzin and driftin a little bit.",1453334400,21,5284,5.183098591549296

The song of ""On Love"", for example, is visually gorgeous and emotionally heart warming.  I was watching and waiting anxiously for each new piece to be covered.

If you're not already familiar with the poems of The Prophet, this is a wonderfully gorgeous way to be introduced to them.  The story is captivating and pulls on your heartstrings, written beautifully but also visually stunning.

8731851,4,B014U45DSU,"It seems that everyone loves The Poet - everyone but the authorities, of course, who've had him under house arrest for years. During that time, the cleaning lady and her mute daughter befriend him as well. So, when the authorities find a chance to ship him out and make him someone else's problem, they leap on it.

But first they have to get him through the city, where his admirers (i.e., everyone) wants to stop and talk with him, or join their celebrations or ... well, anything but go. Really, though, it's not the plot that makes this movie, it's warmth and admiration for the quiet, peaceful Poet. In Neeson's warm, deep voice, he utters words of wisdom wherever he goes. At least, the townsfolk take it as wisdom - I found as vague and oracular as a newspaper horoscope, so lacking in specifics that the words could be applied to anything at all. If I actually knew someone who spoke in that style, I'd lose interest very quickly. I never read the book but, based on its reputation, that could be an accurate rendering.

I found the ""guest animations"" a pleasant surprise, vignettes in very different visual styles tucked into the main thread.
