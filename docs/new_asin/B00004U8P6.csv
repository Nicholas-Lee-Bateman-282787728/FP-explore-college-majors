1354346,4,B00004U8P6,"This is a remarkable film.  It was made for PBS Television back in January of 1980 and has only recently been re-aired.  Now, it finally comes to home video and hopefully DVD.
The film stars a young Bruce Davison as a man,  George Orr, who is tormented by his dreams.  He believes that his dreams  become reality.  He tries to get help but no one understands him.  He finds  a dream specialist who ends up doing quite a bit of experimenting on him  with very interesting results.
This movie plays out like an extended  Twilight Zone episode.  It's written by and adapted from the novel by  Ursala K. Le Guin which I have not read.  The music is kinda cheesy and  electronic.  Certainly of its time.  But it's still very creepy and will  make you think a lot about your own dreams and the world in general.
I  just saw this film for the first time when it re-aired on PBS so it's fresh  on my mind.  I'm glad to see it making its way to home video.",961113600,8,947,4.213483146067416

There's no other film quite like it, which is part of its charm.  The concepts it deals with and an almost lack of cast at times, accentuate its seamless shift from dreamlike to nightmarish.  This film pulls you in and reveals itself to you on its own terms.  It's an intimate film and the more open to it you are the more the film gives in return.  There's not much more that I can say, but for a low budget made for TV film, it's impressed me more than many films that came from studios with money to burn.",1414713600,2,652,4.260162601626016

I found it slow, cheesy, and heavy-handed where the book was subtle.  In the interview with Ursula K. Le Guin included on the DVD (unambiguously the best element), she explains that when PBS approached her to adapt this book, her response was ""Oh, that's impossible. You could never make a film out of that.""  She seems to have changed her mind, but I have not.  The interviewer also reveals that this was PBS's first made-for-TV movie.  It shows.  The music and the special effects are cheesy.  In the book, George Orr is uncertain as to how much Haber knows for a significant portion, whereas in the movie, everything is voiced aloud.

The book is a classic. The movie is okay, but ultimately unnecessary.  It doesn't add anything.  Read the book.

1354378,4,B00004U8P6,"Why did I not know that a movie had been made of this book, which I read more than once and found utterly engrossing? Well, turns out it was made for TV by PBS, that's why. So once more my gratitude to the people who invented the DVD.

George Orr has a problem. His dreams are effective. Every time he has a dream, he wakes up to find it is true. Problem is, everything changes consistent with his dream, including the memories of the people around him. He's the only one who knows that anything is different.

But the regimented society in which he finds himself when he wakes up from the dream he fell into from exhaustion and radiation burns after the war (see, he dreamed the war had not happened, so of course it hadn't) has a solution. See the shrink. In fact, they send him to ""voluntary treatment"" as an alternative to being incarcerated for drug abuse with Dr. Haber, who is a specialist in dreams.

But Haber has his own dreams. He wants to be a hero and fix the world. And when he finally realizes that George really does change things with his dreams, Haber decides to hypnotize him and give him suggestions what to dream, so that he can solve the world's problems. Anyone who has ever seen ""The Outer Limits"" or ""Twilight Zone"" knows that doesn't work. Fix one thing, you screw up something else. And that's exactly what happens to George and Dr. Haber.

So George consults a civil rights lawyer who just happens to be a beautiful young woman. He wants to get assigned to a different doctor because he doesn't like the way Dr. Haber is using him. Keep your eye on the beautiful lady, because George certainly will.

I can't wreck it for you too bad, but George does eventually resolve all the problems Haber created. And in doing so, tells us something about the Tao and being willing to let things be what they are. Can't push the river, as Ursula K. LeGuin points out in the interview with Bill Moyers which is included on the disc.

It may be a bit corny in spots, but as someone who read the book and loved it, I was pleased with how well the movie respected the complicated concepts involved.",1336953600,,2110,4.397435897435898

1354381,4,B00004U8P6,"Once we understand the trick of the story - the inadvertently evil Dr. Haber's
attempt to force `effective dreamer' George Orr to have dreams that will
change the world for the better keeps inevitably backfiring - the film gets repetitive.

It's so obvious that Dr. Haber's attempts to change the world through George will fail,
that there's not much to be surprised at.  Worse, Haber comes off as a fool for not seeing it.
Beyond that, there's the obvious  `why not have him just dream that things were back the
way they were' possibility that's never explored.

There are some striking images (especially for a $250K film!), and memorable, chilling scenes,
but it feels overextended, as if the same points could have been made better in a 30 minute
`Twilight Zone'  (and, in fact, there was a `Twilight Zone' with a quite similar `be careful what
you wish for' story).

1354382,4,B00004U8P6,"I've seen both film versions and read the novel.  Of the three, the novel is the clear winner and is not dated.  It is much harder for novels to seem dated than it is for movies to seem so. This film version is the preferred one by just about everyone.  It was remade in 2004 and hated by just about everyone. The major difference between the two is how much more artistic the first film was. It was helped by not having a well known actor in the cast either.  In the second film we have James Caan throughout as the psychiatrist.

But what was truly extraordinary was the author's idea.  She was the first to come up with a main character who could dream different realities.  What he dreamt became true.  No one else is aware when these changes take place.  In fact, many of these people simply no longer exist after George dreams them away.  He can change the weather from constant rain to constant sun.  He can give himself a cabin on the beach off the Pacific when no one else has such a thing.  He can dream away most of the population in a plague.

Add into this mix, a psychiatrist who discovers this ability and begins hypnotizing George and having him dream at his suggestions, which include making him a huge honcho with his own institute.

A truly extraordinary novel with a good early film version which you may wish to give a try.

1354383,4,B00004U8P6,"I believe the 1979 movie, The Lathe of Heaven lacks the effects and transition to do the story line justice. It would be easy for some people to lose what is happening in the story as the reality changes in the time frame. The author, Ursula K. Le Guin brings out many questions about the society we live in and the attitudes we have about each other. Although she denies her writing has any intended under tones about the celestial beings and life after death one can not wonder how so many people made that connection when reading the book and/or seeing the movie. All-in-all, I have always liked the story and was thrilled when this movie came out. It is one of my favorite stories.",1265328000,,685,4.444444444444445

The story has remained the same, in short, great! Keep in mind, though, that this is NOT a quality transfer. At the beginning, a disclaimer is shown, informing the viewer that the original film was lost and that the transfer was made from a 2"" tape copy. Combine that with earlier BBC production values and you'll lose any expectation to be blown away visually.

All that being said, though, I'm glad to have it and still appreciate the thought-provoking tale.",1262217600,2,657,4.377049180327869
1354385,5,B00004U8P6,One of my favorit all time movies. It rates up there with ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. The ending is a little confusing and even the writer was not sure what the ending meant but it is fun to discuss with your friends and try to figure out.,1250380800,,241,3.84
1354386,4,B00004U8P6,"Ursula K. LeGuin is among the most literary of SF writers. Her stories center on human strengths, faults, and dilemmas. Fantasy elements in her story just highlight these traits, never becoming the story in themselves.

This adaptation of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/her-famous-novel/dp/1416556966/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">her famous novel</a>&nbsp;presents George Orr, a normal enough guy convicted of some minor drug infraction. When he shows up for court-ordered therapy, the reason for the drugs comes out: he takes them to sleep without dreaming. His dreams terrify him, not as nightmares would, but only after he awakens. Those bizarre images from dreamworld logic turn out to have changed the real world in their image - and changed them so completely that all of human history changes, too, in ways that let George's new world make sense. Only George remembers the old world as well as the new.

Dr. Haber takes on George's case and quickly discovers the truth of George's power. I'm sure everyone agrees, there's plenty in this world that could be improved. Haber sees it his god-given duty to make those improvements, using technological control over George's dreaming mind. A classic story of scientific hubris follows, with blind disregard for many warnings signs along the way. One can almost imagine George and Haber as two discoverers of fire: the one seeking only a way to put it out, the other determined to set the world abalze.

This 1980 movie was probably put together in the late 70s. It carries many marks of that time, including some&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logan-s-Run/dp/B00004VVNB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logan's Run</a>&nbsp;visual styling, bell-bottoms, and Brutalist architecture. I doubt mere coincidence in the close fit between the Brutalist research institute that Haber creates for himself and his brutal approach to George and to the world in general. This modest movie succeeds well, despite minimal effects and total lack of guns'n'chases action. Perhaps it lacks the delicacy of LeGuin's original, but offers plenty to the thinking viewer.

1354387,2,B00004U8P6,"There's a reason all the studio masters were lost and this movie sunk into obscurity. It was made for TV (in the classic sense of made-for-TV, which means the producers have low expectations for quality and coherence), and it was quite correctly chucked in the trash after one or two broadcasts (remember ""broadcasting""?  You flick on the telly, maybe something is on, maybe it isn't, then it's all over - - the show is disposable - - if you miss it, it's never coming back, and probably just as well. There's more meaningless junk on today anyway.)

Along comes [...]  and fishes around in the trash, hoping to revive the Visionary Cult Classic that everyone overlooked, a heady mix of 2001, Twilight Zone, and The Day The Earth Stood Still, a prescient script that informs decades to come and that Real Movie Aficionados recognize as seminal.  Sorry. This isn't it. There's a few dream sequences, a few modifying-the-past-time-travel type paradoxes, a megalomaniac, and -- oddly, out of the blue -- a bunch of stuffy aliens in turtle suits.

1354394,4,B00004U8P6,"Adapted from Ursula K.Le Guin's classic novel, ""The Lathe of Heaven"" was produced for television Thirteen/WNET in New York and originally aired nationally on PBS stations in 1979. A coveted and elusive cult favorite for years, it was reissued on DVD by Newvideo in 2000.

The story takes place in Portland Oregon, in a ""near future"" where the Earth has begun to suffer profound effects from global warming and worldwide pandemics run rampant (hmm, rather prescient, eh?) The film stars Bruce Davison as George Orr, a chronic insomniac who has become convinced that his nightly dreams are affecting reality. Depressed and sleep-deprived, he overdoses on medication and is forced by legal authorities to seek psychiatric help from Dr. William Haber (Kevin Conway), who specializes in experimental dream research.

When Dr. Haber realizes to his amazement that George is not delusional, and does in fact have the ability to literally change the world with his ""affective dreams"", he begins to ""suggest"" reality-altering scenarios to his hypnotized patient. The good doctor's motives are initially altruistic; but as George catches on that he is being used like a guinea pig, he rebels. A cat and mouse game of the subconscious ensues; every time Dr. Haber attempts to make his Utopian visions a reality, George finds a way to subvert the results.

The temptation to play God begins to consume Dr. Haber, and he begins to feverishly develop a technology that will allow him to make George's participation superfluous. So begins a battle of wills between the two men that will determine the very fabric of reality.

This is an intelligent and compelling sci-fi fable with a lot of thoughtful subtext; it is certainly one of the best ""made-for-TV"" films ever produced, and highly recommended.

I probably should warn you that the picture quality and sound on the DVD is not quite up to today's more demanding A/V equipment specs; apparently the master no longer exists, so the transfer was made from 2"" tape copy. Don't let the low-tech special effects throw you, either (remember, this was made for public TV in 1979 on a relative shoestring). Substantively speaking, however, I'd wager that ""The Lathe of Heaven"" has much more to offer than any $200 million dollar special effects-laden George Lucas ""prequel"" one would care to name!",1190764800,,2329,5.070496083550914

I watched it with fascination like most of the reviewers here, and I viewed it anew last night on DVD with equal curiosity. Does the story still have validity today? Yes, it does; the message is as timeless as Goethe's. Is the DVD transfer good? Well, to be fair, the producers tell us at the outset the digital transfer of the colours may be dark and imperfect from the only surviving two inch video tape.

1354397,5,B00004U8P6,"This first made for Public TV movie is an excellent adaptation of the singular ""speculative fiction"" novel, ""The Lathe of Heaven"", by the well known and talented author, Ursula K. Le Guin. Like the novel, the movie has a fluid fast pace, but with plenty of appropriate details of character, foreground and background. This gives a rich and vivid quality to the changing course of the flow of the plot, via colorful and creative sharp screenplay. However, as the motion and emotion move along, they are not overdone, giving a balanced ""realistic"" feel to such a ""dreamy"" story. Again, like the novel, the movie can be followed in a number of ""symbolic"" ways. It could be ""objective"" allegory, dealing with common human and world themes of mystical religion. Or, it could be ""subjective"" allegory dealing with a ""typical"" dreaming series of a ""typical"" human, with the main ""personas"" representing the major ""parts"" of the human psyche. Yet, it could be a ""singular"" metadream of one individual, a unique ""just so"" adventure of one George Orr.

In any case, this viewer feels that the novel was indeed successfully transfered over into the movie, which seems to be rare for ""speculative fiction"", and especially for such a surrealistic type. Amazing, that such a ""verbal"" media work can be rendered so well as a ""visual"" media work. Ursula K. Le Guin was on site as the movie was made, in only a few weeks with only a quarter million dollars. The DVD has an interesting and informative interview, with Ursula K.

1354399,5,B00004U8P6,"The Greatest Good for the Greatest Number! What can I say about this brilliantly plotted work of literature brought to life though a cheaply budgeted but great film? Essentially a Dream Psychologist discovers that his assigned patient is telling him the truth when he is informed that the patients effective dreams can change reality. Haber uses this talent to re-create the world in the images that a smart scientist believes best. First he creates the means by making his status in society important with the creation of a new institute dedicated to Oeinerology (dream research) and uses George Orr's mind to increase the power of his augmentor machine. This done, he begins to change the world through dream suggestion to make the world right in a matter of weeks that thousands of years of history could not do. But because of the mind of Mr. Orr, both positive and negative things happen. Haber is not thwarted by this but pressures Orr to perfect his augmentor through dreams so that he can change the world without Orr's mind. The only problem is that he discovers a great secret when he finally ventures into the Lathe of Heaven. He discovers that all existence is in the mind of Orr and that the world had really ended some time ago due to Nuclear armageddon. Orr, a staggering survivor nearing death by radioactive poisoning, willed the world back into an existence that is really an effective dream of his own making!!!",1151280000,4,1430,4.793522267206478

1354401,5,B00004U8P6,"I taped ""The Lathe of Heaven"" from public TV years ago, when the picture on Channel 13 had a big vertical stripe in it...a reflection off of the World Trade Center, so I've been told. I must have looked at the video a zillion times. Great story, superb acting, wonderful cast. Then, after a long, long wait, the DVD was released and I was very excited! I whipped the disc into my player and began to watch. Nearly at the end of the film there is a key scene which is central to the story. There is a well known recording used. It is ""With A Little Help From My Friends"" by The Beatles. When that song played, in the context of the story, it used to bring tears to my eyes. An extremely effective marriage of music and images. I'm not just a sentimental sci-fi slob. I attended the NYU film school, as a matter of fact. Now to my complaint...to the people who prepared this DVD: At the very moment I should have heard The Beatles, I was horrified to hear some B-grade imitation of the fab four cranking out a poor substitue for the original song.

My viewing experience was ruined! The DVD should have a warning label on it. It dosen't matter about copyright problems. This DVD should never have been issued. It has been greatly compromised by this omission, and If the author of ""The Lathe of Heaven"" knew how this cheap shortcut has undercut her story, she would have dreamed the whole project out of existence.

1354405,5,B00004U8P6,"..when the news of PBS broadcasting this TV movie on public TV back in the late summer of 1979, I read the reviews in the paper about this unusual sci-fi movie, which to me, had the veins and hints of the ITC 1968 TV limited series, ""the Prisoner"", with Patrick MaGoohan - the story of ""dehumanization.""

Thus, I set up my VCR, had a new tape in the machine and captured this one-performance event, that would escape us for all of these years until the announcement of the DVD release was made, which was like a re-encarnation of sorts in bringing out such a rare yet classic piece of film history.  As I watched this film while capturing it on tape which was presented in its entirety (which was unheard of in those days to see a movie on air TV without commericals. Yet, of course, this is PBS..), I sat with extreme awe on how deep and powerful this movie was and how the story evolved with character development, the plot and the ending.

True, if this story was ever remade as a feature motion picture, it would never have the charm and originality as this original PBS release.

I still have that original video tape of this film that I made in 1979.",1115596800,2,1156,4.362790697674418
1354406,5,B00004U8P6,"If God is everything, then everything is God. Without ourselves, the universe as we know it would not exist. Each person is a unique prism which fractionates the rays of life into a unique experience. Therefore, we are God. We have infinite power if we choose to have it because we are capable of thought. Thought is energy. Energy is mass. Mass is force, and force creates change. Through what you would call the ""butterfly"" effect, a simple intangible thought can change the entire universe (read about the Hologram Theory). All you have to do is seek that which is inside us (opposite of materialism). That's the power of dreams, a connection to Man's deep subconscious, but  in order to obtain it, one has to achieve Balance. George Orr has balance. Balance is freedom, but balance varies from individual to individual, and what makes Orr different from the mad scientist is that the mad scientist would push his sense of balance on others, while Orr would let others achieve their own balance. The mad scientist is totalitarianism. Orr is freedom.

Imagine infinity as a sheet of paper. Balance is a straight line from one corner to the opposite corner, resulting in the longest line possible. Imbalance results in a line that deviates and is therefore shorter. We want to have the longest line possible, and that line can be measured by years, quality of life, experience, whatever we choose. Balance is individualized.

1354407,5,B00004U8P6,"We've only been waiting 20 years to see this movie again.  Apparently, this movie had quite an effect on people.  So much so that it is PBS' most requested movie to date.  It was only aired once 20 years ago but everyone who saw it remembered it.  PBS finally aired it in 2000 twice in a row (during one of their pledge drives) and people ran frantically all over the house to find a blank video tape so they could record it and called their friends to tell them it was on again.  In interviews with the original cast, it came to light that even they couldn't get copies of it.  Bruce Davison said that people have been begging, pleading and bribing him for a copy for the last 20 years but he didn't even have one himself.  To have this movie on DVD is sheer heaven since it will last a lifetime.

Lathe of Heaven is quite a strange tale.  Imagine being afraid to sleep because every time you dream, you changed the world.  That was the world for George Orr (Davison) and the mad shrink, Dr. Haber, that tried to control Orr's power.  Of course what Dr. Haber asks George to dream and what George dreamt are 2 different things.  Haber continually tries to correct what's been dreamt up with disasterous results.  I don't believe the whole story needs to be retold here.  You should just watch it to see what all the fuss is about.  You know all you need to know.  There were no big budget special effects.  No elaborate sets or costumes.  Still folks were dying to see it again.  This movie was redone and broadcast in 2002.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't the original.  Margaret Avery's role of Orr's attorney was played by Lisa Bonet in the 2002 version.

I suggest that you buy this before it runs out of stock.  You wouldn't want to wait another 20 years to see it now, would you?

1354408,5,B00004U8P6,"Great movie, one that I'd always heard of, but had never seen. Well, until I learned they put it on DVD! It's one of those movies that's aged well - not visually, of course, but because the strange late 70's production values (low budget, shot on video) add a certain other-wordly flavor, which is perfect for an other-wordly story like this. The video quality is fuzzy and blurry and dark, and they explain before the movie is shown that the original materials for the movie have been lost forever and they were forced to rely on a 2"" video tape copy for the DVD transfer. But the muddy look truly does add a nice flavor to the story, and for me it's one of the reasons this movie is so re-watchable. I've read about others complaining about the acting, but I thought everyone was great, except for maybe the black lawyer lady - she makes a few scenes feel awkward with her laid back delivery of her lines. I also have read people complain about the electronic music they use. Again, I think this is a benefit to the atmosphere and story, since to me it's eerie and feels lonely. Which is how the character feels in this changing world of his. Anyway, I loved this movie, it's much better than the remake they did last year (talk about bad acting), and it has a big rewatchability factor. You'll never hear the word ""Antwerp"" the same way again!",1081123200,7,1346,4.431451612903226

1354411,5,B00004U8P6,"The 1980 PBS version of ""The Lathe of Heaven"" was the Science Fiction equivalent of the Marx Brother's ""Animal Crackers"" or John Frankenheimer's ""The Manchurian Candidate""; a classic that was unavailable to the masses for some stupid legal reason (in this case the unauthorized used of the Beatles' song ""A Little Help From My Friends""-the film now has a cover version of the song).  Now the adaptation of Ursula K. Le Guin's celebrated novel about a man whose dreams become reality is available in a DVD edition that offers a 20-minute interview with the author by Bill Moyers.  But the chief attraction remains the film and its compelling parable, which explains why bad bootleg copies were prized for so long.
The story is about George Orr (Bruce Davison), a man living in Portland, Oregon in the year 2002 who dreams become reality.  George tries to control his dreams by taking drugs.  Dr. William Haber (Kevin Conway), a psychiatrist assigned to cure George's neurosis after he accidentally overdoses, learns his gift is real and uses hypnosis to try and have his patient change reality to make the world a better place.  However, Dr. Haber learns that the best laid plans of mice and psychiatrists often go astray.  The lesson is to live in harmony with your existence because an attempt to force change inevitably makes things worse.  Even the desire to solve the race problem or to bring about world peace can go astray.
George has the power but it is Dr. Haber who takes the responsibility who trying to save humanity from a bleak future.  You can compare ""The Lathe of Heaven"" with Stephen King's ""The Dead Zone,"" where the power and the responsibility both lie with John Smith.  Instead of focusing more on the ethics of the question of intervening in the course of human events, Le Guin is more interested in the pragmatics of using the power involved for the greater good.  In that regard ""The Lathe of Heaven"" is a futuristic version of all those stories were a human is granted a wish by a genii (or devil) who invariable provides a twist worth of ""The Twilight Zone.""  But as Haber goes from having George change the picture on his wall to having the sun always shine to running the Haber Institute, you are reminded more of the story of the Fisherman's wife who kept demanding that the magic fish caught by her husband keep making her someone more and more powerful until she demands to be god.
The special effects are what you would expect from a PBS production in 1980 (the budget was $250,000), but there are not crucial to the telling of the tale, so you can take their shortcomings into account.  This is one of the more cerebral films in the history of Science Fiction and what compels us to think is the story and not the special effects.  This production ""The Lathe of Heaven"" was directed by  Fred Barzyk and David E. Lonton from the screenplay by Robert E. Swayhill and Diane English (yes, the one who created ""Murphy Brown""; this was her first television script).  They can remake ""The Lathe of Heaven,"" obviously, but they cannot recapture the intrinsic elements that made this low-budget work a Science Fiction classic.",1049932800,20,3150,4.7226277372262775
1354412,5,B00004U8P6,"When PBS made this film, they selected possibly one of the most difficult LeGuin novels to adapt.  Space aliens, U.F.O.'s, mind journeys, apocalyptic journeys, and turtles.  However, the production is top notch, though they lack of budget is noticable in scenes.  The story comes across from the book very neatly, and is a fascinating watch.  Mainly, because you're rivetted by the story, and not by the FX (or lack thereof).  This film was made again in 2002, a very stilted rendition that had big name actors, more budget, and less interest.
The story: Ben Orr's dreams things that mystically translate into reality.  His psychiatrist attempts to direct Orr's dreams, but fails over and over on continually grander scales (likely through Orr's subconscious protests to being used in this manner).  There is more, but it wouldn't be right to ruin the fun for people who are unfamiliar with the story.
This movie could be considered an American foreign film.  Right in their with overseas cinematic greats such as SOLARIS and ALPHAVILLE, it is a film for those who like to ponder thoughts deeper than achieved in high-budget blockbuster drivel (THE MATRIX excluded).  You won't see fantastic special effects, though you will see adequate effects and fantastic storytelling.  The DVD includes a great interview with the underappreciated author Ursula K. LeGuin, though not many other features; scene selection and interactive menu.  So it doesn't have tons of features-so what?  This DVD is well worth it simply to own this movie, if you want to see great DVD features, buy MONSTERS, INC.

1354413,5,B00004U8P6,"1980: Ursula Leguin's novel ""The Lathe Of Heaven"" was a deeply symbolic, metaphysical work of science fiction that even Ursula Leguin herself believed was quite impossible to make into a film.  But, nevertheless, the film was made and to great acclaim. In 1980, it was the first film that appeared on PBS. The Lathe Of Heaven stars Bruce Davison as George Orr and Kevin Conway as Dr. Haber. Following a lot of the novel's premise, with subtle, strange music and powerful imagery, this film is stunning. It is, in my personal opinion, as well as another reviewer, a work of science fiction at paar, if not higher, than ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Finally, this masterpiece is on DVD, containing the original film and an interview between journalist Bill Moyers and Ursual Leguin herself. Bill Moyers had interviewed Joseph Campbell, whose ""Power Of Myth"" series can compliment this film as well.
George Orr (Bruce Davison, resembling, as one viewer said Mark Hammill who played Luke Skywalker) is a troubled young man.  He discovers that his dreams have the unsettling power of changing reality and the space time continuum, altering the future. When George Orr seeks help from a dream analyst and psychiatrist, Dr. Haber. When Dr. Haber uncovers George's secret, he begins to harness its power. Session after session with George Orr, he attempts to make the world a better place - he tries to eliminate disease and world hunger, racism and tries to bring about world peace. But each alteration produces a negative effect and a dark consequence. The world is destroyed and aliens dominate humanity. Dr. Haber becomes consumed with his thrist for power, corrupted by his obscession to play and become God. But the aliens sternly warn that such people are destroyed by the lathe of heaven.
George Orr manages to escape and Dr. Haber's demise is the crippling of his powers and old age. Bill Moyers and Ursula Leguin speak of the powerful imagery in the film and its striking  and frightening use of collective unconscious. Ursula Leguin is a gifted writer, drawing inspiration from mystic sources, a New Age philosopher with the deepest perception of human nature. I strongly suggest that viewers interested in poignant and meaningful science fiction (a la 2001: Space Odyssey) see this film. It is also a great film companion to the novel. For college or high school level students, this film should be very educational as well as entertaining.",1046563200,2,2439,4.973039215686274

1354415,4,B00004U8P6,"1980's The Lathe of Heaven was the first in what was supposed to be a series of television adaptations of major science fiction works of literature by PBS. Unfortunately that project was abandoned because this was the only movie in that series and it represented an excellent start.
The television movie is very faithful to the book, containing only a few variations and omissions from the source material, primarily to make it fit within the two hour framework. Bruce Davison is the perfect George Orr. He plays George as a simple man who only wants a normal life. He does not want the awesome responsibility of his ""effective"" dreaming and he hopes that Dr. Haber will be able to cure him. However, he becomes aware of what Haber is doing and George knows that he must get out from under his control. Kevin Conway does an equally good job of portraying Dr. Haber. The psychiatrist is a powerful man in contrast to the somewhat timid George Orr. He is not an evil man, but he does become blinded by his own good intentions. This becomes more apparent as Haber delves deeper and deeper into his attempts to control George's Dreams. Margaret Avery, as the social worker Heather Lelache, also does a good job of sharing the stage with the two main characters and does not get swallowed up by their more dominating performances.
Since the movie was made in 1980, it is somewhat dated. Dr. Haber's super computer which occupies an entire office seems like an antique in comparison to today's stealth machines. Also, the extremely limited budget results in some incredibly cheesy special effects at times, especially the alien invasion scene. The aliens themselves are fairly well done, though. They come very close to resembling Le Guin's descriptions of them in the book. Overall, the pros far outweigh the cons, and this television adaptation of The Lathe of Heaven ranks among the finer science fiction movies.",1044403200,3,1909,4.840978593272172
1354416,4,B00004U8P6,"Those who insist on using their powers of reason to understand what cannot be understood will face the lathe of heaven.  In this 1980 flick shot for PBS, the ""lathe"" is the realm of ""reactive dreams"" - dreams that change reality.  In the first scene of ""Lathe"", luckless George Orr stumbles through the debris of Seattle in the aftermath of WWIII.  He then finds himself in his own bed - Seattle looking positively dreary, but otherwise intact.  It was all a dream...or was it.  George begins knowing of his power to alter reality with his dreams, but it's not a realization he feels happy about.  Referred by a social worker, Heather Lelache, George finds himself in the offices of Dr. Haber, a psychiatrist who comes to realize George's power, and learns how to manipulate it using post-hypnotic suggestion (""Antwerp"").  The results, promising at first, turn disastrous - plans to dream away hunger and war instead result in a global plague and interstellar invasion.  Haber, unable to resist the call of the lathe of heaven, is only determined to gain complete control of Orr's power for the betterment of man.
This is the version you should have - the classic that looks pristine over 20 years later.  Consider the performances of Harrison as Orr: though under Haber's control, he proves to be his own man (especially in a pivotal scene as Haber's office is to be invaded by aliens.  But the story belongs to Kevin Conway as Haber, who develops into one of sci-fi's more menacing villains.  The ultimate archetype of science gone too far, Haber's faustian progression is smooth, plausible and downright scary.  Though the film stands on its own, I'm mostly drawn to the film's dated look, grainy film, electronic score and a vision of the future that's pure 1980, in which the future is nothing more than clean skyscrapers of steel and glass.  This version of ""Lathe"" is perfect being naivety and knowing at the same time.  And, yes, though you've probably heard it from just about every other reviewer here, this version beats the 2002 A&E version.",1043020800,,2053,4.828571428571428

1354422,5,B00004U8P6,"What makes a great sci-fi movie ? Visual effects ? Good performances from the actors ? The answer is really simple. It takes its theme, its meaning and its content as well as its creativity. 2001: A Space Odyssey, also adapted from a classic sci-fi novel, comes first to people's minds when they think of the greatest sci-fi movie. I enjoyed the film as well and understand the fascination with audiences to the entire scientific, speculative, space-time themes, alien forces in obelisks and of course, the conniving computer HAL. But author Le Guin (Left Hand Of Darkness) wrote a book which, in my opinion, is the greatest science fiction tale ever made, yet to be surpassed. When, in 1980, it was released as a film, it was the first film broadcast on PBS, the greatest tv channel ever made. Ad a film, it is stunning, symbolic, allegorical, frightening in its intensity and beautiful in it theme of transcience and eternal struggles of good and evil. George Orr, played by an actor who talks and looks somewhat like Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), is a neurotic young man who undertakes involuntary therapy in the future, a world that has survived a great global destruction. His therapist hypnotizes him and uses a machine to tap into his mind as he discovers that his dreams affect present reality. We discover also, that it has been his dreams that has altered human history since the Stone Age all the way to the Armaggedon, nuclear Holocaust that destroyed the world ""before April."" The therapist, although well-meaning in his quest to vanquish racism, disease, world hunger and all the major problems in the world, only ends up destroying more than he creates. The therapist/doctor has been labeled as the film's villain, which is not what Leguin herself intended. The therapist is good, as all people are innately good. We remember the line when he tells George Orr, ""we are going to make the world right."" But the elemental forces of nature cannot be controlled by neither God or man, and regardless of our noble intentions, there are dark consequences every time we try do to something to better ourselves. Life, all life, in the past, now and in the future, can only be composed of creative and destructive forces, good and evil, in a yin-yang balance that is eternal and necessary for there to be existence. The interpretation I made the first time I viewed the film was this, although you may interpret any which way you'd like - the individual (George Orr), each of us, man or woman, is an instrument or sum of nature and we are as if part of a bigger dream or series of dreams that is our lifetime, the dreams ending completely when we die. In order to be truly happy, we must always do good, we must be ourselves and not sacrifice neither or individuality nor compassion and humanity- something the doctor seems to have done in a drunken pursuit of power. As for meaning in our life, yes, there is meaning, when we find a religion, belief, career, marriage, love, ANY relationship,  and friendship and the meaning of every collective person makes up a beautiful dream, and the dream is over when we die. It was very obvious that the therapist doctor was a parody of religion, or God himself (He tells Orr when he abandons his clinic ""You will be back! Without me there is no hope""something no person can do alone in his or her lifetime, and the patient is people altogether. The therapist/patient relationships becomes God/man relationship and the entire meaning of life. This is more profound than even the message in 2001: A Space Odyssey. This voyage into inner space, outer space and everywhere at once, is the most fascinating film ever made about science fiction and the mystery of the universe. I recommend everyone to see this film I urge teachers to read this book to college or high school level students. It's about nothing. It's about everything. It's about what is, what is not and what is to be. Like one of George Orr's dreams.",1031443200,15,3959,4.721098265895954

The Lathe of Heaven is an excelent example of how following the book exactly does not mean that the movie is excellent. I think the novel is one of the best Sci-Fi books ever written. I like it far better than ""Snowcrash,"" or ""Neuromancer."" This movie is poorly acted, has special effects that are laughable, was edited by a heavy handed oaf without an artistic bone in his body, and has a soundtrack so bad that the ""Flash Gordon"" sound track looks good in comparison. On the other hand, the script was an excelent and faithful adaptation of the novel, and when it came out on DVD I bought it.
As long as we are all dreaming effectively, can we dream that someone will take that excellent script and give it to some real actors and movie makers.

The picture is bad and the sound is dismal.  It looks like somebodys old bootleg tape (which it is, they explain it in a prologue).  The special effects were laughable even by the standards of the day.  Ditto the costuming. For all that, though, this is worth seeing.  The story of a man who can change reality through his uncontrolled (and uncontollable) dreams has a timelessness to it that I would normally only associate with H.G. Wells. It is well paced, intelligently acted, brilliantly scripted.  Extras include an interview with LeGuin that any fan of hers is going to want to see.

1354427,5,B00004U8P6,"Years ago when I hung out at the CompuServe SciFi forum in it's heyday, I left a message commenting on this movie (going back a decade or so here) - Ursula Le Guin actually mailed me her copy of the movie to copy for myself (this was back when VCR's were still $500+ items) - I made my copy...to Betamax.  When the old Beta unit bit the dust, so did my tape collection.

When I saw that The Lathe of Heaven was out on DVD, I grabbed it ASAP.  Sure the special effects are low-tech - remember this was a local PBS production.  But the plot is great, the story is true to the book, and a name that sounds like (JorJor - no, not JarJar) is memorable.

What makes this movie stand out - the PLOT carries it - the special effects are secondary - so what if they are low budget and cheesy by today's CG standards.  If you never read the book, you'll be nailed by the ending.

FAR SUPERIOR to the remake from a couple years ago!!",1014076800,2,922,4.060773480662983
1354428,5,B00004U8P6,"This is a great sci-fi picture about an ordinary man (George Orr)
 who is ""cursed"" with the ability to have his dreams become reality (whether he wants them to or not).  As you may have guessed, he ends up getting psychoanalyzed by a shrink (Dr. William Haber).  Eventually, the psychologist concludes that Orr is telling the truth.
Upon this discovery, Haber begins to manipulate Orr's dreams so that he may make good things happen.  It all starts out innocently enough;  stuff like changing the weather, making Orr dream up bigger and better facilities / equipment for the good Dr. to practice his craft.  However, when he attempts to take on the ""big"" problems of humanity (overpopulation, racism, war, etc), he begins to encounter what is called in science the ""law of unintended consequences.""
Therein lies the real substance of this story.  Based on the book by Ursala Le Guin, the movie asks the question of how capable we are of operating the tremendous tools of science that we have at our disposal.  Are we competent enough to manipulate the scientific ""dreams"" which we bring into reality, without their turning into a nightmare?
As a bonus, there is also a Bill Moyers interview with Le Guin that is included on the DVD.  Le Guin describes Orr as a Taoist type of person, and upon reflection, this depiction does make sense.  In particular, I was reminded of the following passage in Lao-Tzu's ""Tao Te Ching"":
Therefore,
The Sage Rules
  By emptying hearts and filling bellies,
  By weakening ambitions and strengthening bones;
Leads people
  Away from knowing and wanting;
Deters those who know too much
  From going too far:
Practices non-action
  And the natural order is not disrupted.
  -Tao Te Ching, 3, Trans:  Stephen Addiss and Stanley Lombardo
This is a great film, esp for sci-fi enthusiasts.  It is a low budget PBS production, so don't expect any dazzling special effects.  However,  if substance means more to you than spectacle, and you enjoy original sci-fi, this might just be a DVD worth buying.  Also, for those who might be confused by the opening sequence, ask yourself this:  which is the dream?  And which is reality?

1354431,5,B00004U8P6,"Gosh,all these years I thought I was alone in my fixation of the PBS TV-Movie production of ""The Lathe of Heaven"".
See, I was one of those prescient geeks who taped it on a big, bulky, & then-seemingly exotic $1,000 ""VHS"" (whatever that was!) tape machine when it was originally broadcast (no cable!) in 1980.
And I've watched that tape many times ever since, never realizing that (a) I was somehow ""prescient"" and (b) that there was some arcane ""legal battle"" underway that kept it from being seen again.
If only I'd been paying attention: the bootleg money I could have made!
But as for critical remarks: I have since come to understand that  the plot is a screed for the reactionary Libertarian dogma that all Liberal actions have unanticipated negative consequences (and that therefore no Liberal actions should ever be undertaken). The tip-off is the Dept. of Health and Human Services Bureaucrat who cheerfully crows, ""Not my department!"" when poor George Orr says he needs some new red-tape credential or other. Looking back, I now see I should have spotted the right-wing politics in the novel when Ursula K. depicted an aged ""pothead"" who could hardly function when George knocks on his door (but this was before Reagan and I was probably stoned).
Nevertheless, the PBS production of her story is right-on and is irresistable movie-making.
I have always liked the proto-synthesizer soundtrack, which  -alas- has never been commercially available. It was catchy, especially where it melded the Beatles'""A Little Help From My Friends"" with the movie score - the cause(I assume) of the two-decades-long legal hassle that kept it from the public, knowing Yoko Ono for the litigious witch that she is.
Oh My, I'm beginning to sound like a tort-reform-minded Libertarian!

1354433,5,B00004U8P6,"I remember seeing The Lathe of Heaven on PBS back in 1979, after hearing about it in the pages of Starlog magazine.  Normally, a 13-year old would rather be outside on a sunny Saturday afternoon, but I found the film so compelling, I had to watch both hours (which was originally aired in two parts, shown back-to-back, but now cut together on this DVD).  I had never heard of Ursula K. LeGuin nor this novel before I saw the film, but both the story and how it was visually interpreted so resonated with me, scenes from this film have been permanently etched in my memory.  I can't think of any other film that's left me quite as haunted, or made me think as deeply.  My concern, based partly on other reviews here, was that after 20 years, I would find the film disappointing or less than satisfying now that I'm older.  But you know what?  I'm so glad I purchased the DVD after all.  The Lathe of Heaven is still just as compelling as it was the Saturday I first saw it, and the haunting feeling it gave me as a teenager came flooding back as I watched it again.  Sure, the film has some flaws, but they're minor in the grand scheme of things.  The fact that the transfer quality is less than stellar actually *helps* the film, ironically enough.  The darkness of some scenes and the washed-out look of others actually adds to the dream-like feel of the viewing experience.  The acting from Kevin Conway and a very young Bruce Davison is superb, which more than compensates for the presence of Margaret Avery, an otherwise excellent actress who seems confused here.  (Thankfully, she doesn't figure into the film all that heavily.)  And because the production, due to its low budget, found buildings with interesting modern architecture in which to shoot (requiring little set decoration), there is a ""realness"" to the film that overcomes the occasional cheap special effect.  I was very, very pleased to discover that The Lathe of Heaven has held up so well.  If that isn't reason enough to own this film, get it just for the lengthy interview with Ursula K. LeGuin.  That alone is worth purchasing, and it serves as an excellent bonus to a superb SF film that was worth the wait to see again.",985132800,8,2197,4.566326530612245
1354434,4,B00004U8P6,"This intriguing film is a cinematic adaptation of a popular science fiction book written by Ursula K. Le Guin. A made for TV PBS special, it first aired back in 1979 and has since developed a cult following. Considering that it was made on a shoestring budget of $250,000, I must say that I was impressed with what was done. Those involved in the production certainly made a little go a long way.

The film, which definitely has a futuristic, Orwellian feel to it, revolves around a troubled young man, George Orr, played by a young Bruce Davison, who is haunted by dreams that become reality. He goes to a dream therapist in hopes of finding surcease. The therapist, a Dr. Haber, recognizes the potential power inherent in this ability and plays God, giving the hapless Orr a post hypnotic suggestion to help him dream of something which will help the human condition. All thought by Dr. Haber of the good of the patient is tossed aside in the quest for the common good.

Alas, all does not go to plan. As the old saying goes, be careful what you wish for, as you just might get it. Here, it becomes somewhat of the proverbial monkey's paw. Moreover, what starts out as a desire to help humanity is quickly jettisoned, as issues of power and control rise to the forefront, and a megalomaniacal Dr. Haber loses all sense of perspective, with the easygoing Orr being manipulated by the controlling Dr. Haber. What happens to both patient and doctor is certainly a catalyst for thought provoking discussions, as is the end result, given the complexity of the underlying issues.

What makes this DVD particularly interesting is the inclusion of a conversation between Bill Moyers and author Ursula K. Le Guin, in which the novel and the film are discussed.

1354435,5,B00004U8P6,"The Lathe of Heaven was first broadcast on PBS twenty years ago, and it has stayed with me ever since. The story is unique and fascinating, and deserves multiple viewings so you can discover new things each time you view the film.
The story goes far beyond standard sci-fi fare, as it delves deep into the human mind, including the things we love, desire, and--most vividly--fear.
And the film will make you wonder: ""How would I construct the Utopian world?""
In two ways, The Lathe of Heaven can be compared to Planet of the Apes. Both films are science fiction; but more importantly, they make us THINK as well as examine ourselves and our society. This quality is most rare in science fiction. Through these films we realize once again that the human mind can be dark and deadly as well as shining and life-affirming.
If you're a sci-fi fan looking for over-the-top special effects, look elsewhere. The visuals are both dated and spartan. Further, the video quality is ""dark"" and unclear by normal standards.
Nonetheless, the special effects work: They take us into a surreal world of nightmarish visions. Interestingly, on the stage, many of the film's special effects would seem right at home.
The actor's performances seem like an afterthought compared to the compelling story. They speak and move and interact quietly, and emotional outbursts are rare. But that is how it should be, as their words and the ideas they project are what will pull you into this film.

1354436,4,B00004U8P6,"I had fond memories of the film having seen it when it was was first broadcast by PBS in 1980.  It was a modestly produced ($250,000), ambitious (taking on a difficult to film science fiction novel), first ever P.B.S. produced movie.  It was supposed to be one of several PBS produced films, but legal problems tied to music rights de-railed the project and kept the film un-available for 20 years.  The way many people have seen it is on bootlegged black market videos.
The movie very good, but it's poor special effects and flaws may make first-time viewers wonder what the big deal is all about.  The movie is a mostly successful attempt at making a worthy film out of great novel by Ursulla K. Le Guin.
I enjoyed the film a great deal, but there is  some truly horrendously written dialogue, and some very unfortunate directorial choices.  The acting by Bruce Davison and Kevin Conway remains quite good.  Conway goes a bit over-the top and borders on campy melodramatics a few times, but not enough to de-rail the film.  Indeed the budget restraints of the film requires the type of energetic Pavlovian performance he gives.  Margaret Avery however never over-comes the fact the script has given her little to do and the directors aren't sure how to best utilize her.  In one scene her character is passionate but in the next she is almost apathetic.  The original story and its ideas are strong enough to withstand such flaws however.
The film is Directed by Fred Barzyk and David R. Loxton and written by Roger E. Swaybill and Diane (creator of t.v.'s Murphy Brown !) English.
You can see how this film might have incluenced films like Brazil, Bladerunner and The Matrix.
The film's special effects are cheap and a few steps below the level of an old Star Trek episode.  This might be distracting to viewers. The film however isn't relying on it's effect but it's ideas and I hope new viewers can get past the dated cheesiness of the effects and enjoy what the film is about.
I hope so.  The film ultimately overcomes its limitations and works very well as an above average example of an intelligent science fiction film.  There haven't been many of those.
The film is about a well-meaning Icarus who pushes too hard and flies too close to the sun with disastrous results.
George Orr ( portrayed by Bruce Davison, who at the time was most famous for Willard and Fortune in Men's Eyes and recently played the Senator in the X MEN film) is an everyman in a Portland, Oregon of the `near future'.  The world is over-populated and on the brink of economic disaster.  Weather patterns have been altered by the effects of nuclear war.  George Orr believes that when he dreams, he changes reality.  He tries to prevent himself from dreaming and has recently over-dosed on drugs. Under terms of his probation he must go and discuss his problems with Dr.  Haber an Oneilogist (who specializes in dreams).  At first, the doctor doesn't believe that George Orr can actually change reality with his dreams.  Only George you see remembers how things were before he dreamed.  He's lived with the guilt and horror of how his dreams change reality since he discovered his unique gift or curse when he was 17.  As viewers, we quickly believe George is telling the truth. His dreams do change reality.  Then Haber suggests to George that he change the weather patterns in his dream.  The Doctor runs up to roof of the building while George dreams and watches with amazement as the always cloudy skies, suddenly become blue and sunny. Most of the population think it's been sunny for several years, but George and the Doctor know that it was George's dream that changed things.  The doctor realizes that he can cure all of the world's problems by hypnotizing George and giving him suggestions about what he should dream.
Like in the Monkey's Paw, however, one must be careful what is asked for or disaster could result.  George is well aware of the dangers of what the Doctor is doing, but the Doctor won't listen to him.  Will George be cured of his `effective dreams'?  Will the Doctor playing God destroy the world he is trying to save?  Will ever changing reality make it impossible for George to re-connect with the woman he has fallen in love with?
While I was disappointed  the film did not age as well as I had hoped, it is still a worthwhile one which deserved to be saved from obscurity.  It has taken the efforts of several big name stars (Tom Hanks and Jason Alexander for example) and thousands of fans over the last several years to convince P.B.S. management to resolve the legal issues over the music right which have prevented the film from being re-broadcast. They were and the film was re-broadcast on P.B.S. in June of 2000 and recently released on video and DVD.  Included on the DVD is a wonderful interview of (Portland, Oregon based) author Ursula K. Le Guinn by Bill Moyer.
While the rescue of Lathe of Heaven from obscurity is unfortunately not on the level of the restoration of a true masterpiece like Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc, it is a very welcome return of a thought provoking and ambitious film that deserves to be widely seen.
  "" Those whom heaven helps we call the sons of heaven. They do not learn this by learning. They do not work it by working. They do not reason it by using reason.

As an amusing aside.  Ursula K. Le Guinn based the title of her novel on the above translation of an ancient Chinese quote.  However, it was a bad translation because at the time it was written there were no such things as lathes.  Still a great quote and a great title though.

In fact the interview on the DVD is almost as good as the movie itself - did you know Ursula wanted to do the Left Hand of Darkness instead but that they talked her out of it?
The movie is excellent. Although you can tell at the beginning of the DVD that the master wasn't of the best quality, you quickly get sucked into the storyline, accepting some of the shoddy special effects because the plot and acting are so stellar. I was lucky enough to do a 3 hour phone interview with Kevin Conway, and we talked a lot about how much this movie meant to him and what he was thinking about while filming. The movie has had a big impact on both the actors and viewers - most sci fi fans I know remember vividly when this came out, and have been waiting anxiously for its return. I already have a line of friends who want to come watch this with me!
The basic story is that George Orr has dreams which change reality, and simply wants them to stop. His doctor, Dr. Haber, instead decides to use them to change the world and rid it of evil. Ursula explains in the interview that this pits the tao of 'go with the flow' in George vs the progress and change mentality of Dr. Haber.
It's definitely a movie that you can watch many times and really think about, and also a movie that is fun just as an interesting story. Perhaps my favorite part is when George wonders if *everyone* has this ability, to change reality with dreams, and that maybe the 'rug is being pulled out from under us' over and over again without anyone noticing.

My excitement only increased when I read the words  ""Digitally Remastered"" on the front of the package.  Upon viewing  the DVD, my excitement turned to utter disappointment! Although the movie  is GREAT (The 5 stars are for the story alone) the transfer to DVD is  horrible!  There are many low light scenes in this movie that are over  saturated with color and produce 'trails' in the movement of the  characters.  The print this was transfered from needs considerable clean-up  & ""Digitally Remastered"" indicated to me that this had all  been done.  Silly me!  I will never again purchase any video marketed by  Newvideo.  This transfer is only a marginal improvement over my 20 year old  copy from my own VCR.  Again I have to give the movie 5 stars for the  wonderful story & presentation, but I also have to give the transfer to  home video -5 stars - It's a wash!  Worth buying if you love good SciFi but  know what you're getting when you order.",968284800,12,1410,4.407843137254902

Sadly, the answers to these two questions are no and nothing. The  premise of the movie is what happens when dreams come true -- as might be  expected, little good although everything turns out pretty well for our  hero in the end.  My problems with the movie are several: the story-line is  lame and there is no real narrative  drive -- if the movie had simply been  on tv, I am sure I would have bailed-out during a commercial; the acting is  poor -- some of the major players would have difficulty winning parts at  good drama schools; and, finally, the  film is obviously a low-budget,  made-for-tv film that  is poorly produced.

1354446,5,B00004U8P6,"Available again after a 20-year absence, ""The Lathe of Heaven"" has lost none of its power or impact. Not only a compelling story, enhanced by fine  acting, but an invitation to consider the philosophical and ethical questions it raises. You'll discuss this with like-minded friends afterward! Proof positive that good science-fiction is about ideas, not special effects. The essence of this film will never be dated -- highly recommended to all thoughtful viewers.

August 8, 2013 update: Having watched the film again, this time on the already out-of-print DVD with the fine Bill Moyers-Ursula LeGuin interview, I'm reminded of just how good this adaptation of her classic novel really is. In Bruce Davison, Kevin Conway, and Margaret Avery, we have 3 gifted actors who give their all to their roles, grounding the shifting realities that surround them with nuanced humanity. If the special effects were low-budget even then, they're handled well & integrated perfectly into the story; only someone obsessed with geek culture minutia could complain, as they convey everything that has to be conveyed. In fact, flashy & expensive CGI effects would only be a garish distraction here -- since the story is about dreams & the power of the Unconscious, far better to simply suggest the alien ships (for example) with dots of light, and let the viewer's imagination fill in the rest. What counts here is the ominous power of the narrative, because we've already learned that nothing about reality is safe, than anything can happen -- and usually for the worst. And much of that ominous power is enhanced by the score, which is subtle & utterly appropriate. While many 1980s synthesizer scores just don't hold up now, this one is superb.

Again, this story is about ideas, philosophy, ethics -- all explored within a gripping story that treats us like adults & takes for granted our ability to think about it all intelligently. After years of countless mega-million CGI blockbusters that claim to be science-fiction, it's even more refreshing to come back to the real thing. Can you imagine how many excellent films of this caliber could be made on just the costume budget of those blockbusters? It would be a pleasure to see more films that engage the mind & heart, rather than just superficial sensation. A pity it's once more out-of-print! We can only hope that it'll somehow be reissued again in the near future, this time with the proper Beatles version of ""A Little Help From My Friends"" back in place.

That was the only disappointment for me in this re-issue of  this marvelous story/video.  I still hear the Beatle's version with Ringo  singing it though, in my mind when I saw the re-release air on PBS a few  months ago.

The psychological effect of seeing George Orr's small world  constantly change around him is unsettling and exciting.  How fragile is  our existence (and memory?) without our knowing about it?
All these years  I wondered what ever happened to this film (and what it's title was!). I  only saw it once and it has stuck in my mind for two decades. This film has  so many unforgettable images. Hopefully PBS will recognize the popularity  of material like this and produce similar projects.

1354452,4,B00004U8P6,"This film, I believe, originally aired on public television in the early '80's.  It is based on the Ursula K. LeGuinn novel of the same name (in retrospect, perhaps her best novel).  The movie concerns George Orr, a man  who, unwittingly, has developed the power to alter physical reality while  dreaming.  At first, the changes are subtle and unimportant.  Things  change, however, when George encounters a psychiatrist who, by studying  George's brainwaves, construsts a machine  (the ""Augmentor"")  which permits the user to change reality (everyone's reality) at will.  From this point, the movie takes off into a world where everyone's skin is  gray (the psychiatrisst wanted to eliminate racisim but instead created a  grim underpopulated human race with no diversity and, more importantly, no  love interest for George who in a previous reality fell in love with a  black woman), a world populated by terse, very deep thinking space aliens  resembling giant turtles who run curiousity shops, and, finally, a hellish,  bad acid trip type world created when our evil psychiatrist experiences a  nightmare while his brain is attached to the Augmentor.  The performances  are excellent and heartfelt.  The love story involving George Orr (the  alien turtles call him ""Jor Jor"") is also touching.  It is easy  to empathize with Jor Jor whose life is complicated enough as it is;  falling in love, on top of everything else, almost overwhelms him.  The  special effects are also pretty decent, especially toward the end.  I  strongly recommend this movie to any connoisseur of Sci-Fi.

Set in the near future, it follows a young man whose dreams have the power to alter reality (usually with unintended side effects) and the disruptive machinations of his power-hungry therapist / hypnotist. The main plot device is interesting, with each dream leading to a sort of bite-sized Twilight Zone episode, and we're never sure how much the supporting cast recalls of their past reality. Watching for the more subtle changes and trying to outsmart the premise often makes for great fun. The production's age and budget cause numerous problems, though, with a lot of dry, flat acting and poor visual effects. Pacing issues also plague the first act, but once it gains a good head of steam, our wait is rewarded.

The story is about poor George who is afraid to sleep, per chance to dream, for, when he dreams and awakens, his dreams have changed reality. He goes to see a doctor for assistance and his trust is betrayed as the good doctor not only wants to control his dreams, he wants to be the dreamer who controls reality. It is a fascinating story and takes place in Oregon, although it was filmed in Texas (go figure). I am glad to finally be able to watch it again and again, after missing it for many years. Another point of interest is that the dear doctor is unprepared for the reality changes when he makes the subliminal suggestions to poor George; there is always an unforeseen consequence with every dream, which the doctor cannot prepare for.

It was the first of two films produced by the network and one that author Ursula Le Guin thought represented her book.  Great early performance from Bruce Davison (aka Senator Kelly from the first two X-Men movies) and veteran actor Kevin Conway.
