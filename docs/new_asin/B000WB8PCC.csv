8222015,2,B000WB8PCC,"I don't understand all of the raves for this film. After seeing The Nature of Nicholas twice and then reading the various reviews it reminded me of the parable about the boy who finally blurted out the words: ""The emperor has no clothes."" If it was the intent of this film to display the confusion that gripped a 12 year old boy trying to understand and come to terms with his awakening sexuality, then it was certainly successful. But in the process of doing so it became so surreal that I found MYSELF becoming more and more confused. At times, Nicholas (excellently played by Jeff Sutton) imagines his late father as a guiding figure. At other times, his father is presented as some kind of maniacal ventriloquist who manipulates Nicholas's friends into inviting him to get together. We are also shown Nicholas's father looking over him while Nicholas is sound asleep. Since he is asleep, why do WE see his father as we also do when he isn't shown anywhere near Nicholas. The zombie-like state of Bobby, Nicholas's best friend with whom he has a strong attraction, is presented in such a way as to make the viewer really believe that there are two Bobbys. One stolen sudden kiss is blown up into a phantasmagoria of rapidly changing images and scenes that almost turns this film into a borderline horror movie. A slower transition and better editing would have highlighted Nicholas's actual unfolding conflict and confusion. As it stands, Nicholas in my opinion is almost portrayed as a borderline schizophrenic rather than a sexually confused 12 year old. This approach, even if unintended, is a severe disservice to a condition that has unquestionably affected untold numbers of young men as they reach puberty. Obviously, others have seen this film in a different light and future viewers will have to judge for themselves the real nature of Nicholas.",1465516800,2,1857,4.861198738170347
8222016,5,B000WB8PCC,"I take serious exception that this is a movie about a young 12 year old boy who had to accept his penchants for homosexuality.  This is a gross misinterpretation.  Instead, this is an excellent production from the Canadians about the horrid struggles of a boy who just starts into puberty, but lost his Father who was in the Air Force.  His Mother is very maternal to his needs, but he is so deprived of a Father's involvement as he began the
change from a boy to a lad, that he turned to his best friend Bobby for male support.  The producer had the genius to portray a succession of emotional traumas Nicholas had to endure.  The military uniform in the closet, epi-phenomenon episodes of his Father in a closet or walking down the road or his Father's Ghost in military uniform following him are good symbols that memories of Nicholas's Father will follow him throughout life.
Another good illustration of the constant evolving emotions of Nicholas was nothing was forever.  His Mother dating other men, the move from the country to a new home in the city illustrated life went on despite the penchant of Nicholas clinging to the past.  An excellent illustration was Bobby as both a close friend and an imaginary pseudo-Zombie that was dying in the dreams of Nicholas, even when Nicholas kissed his best friend in
both states real and imagined:  His best friend and the country lifestyle he wanted to keep were going away.  It must not be forgotten that a boy like Nicholas will experiment - and experience - emotions and physical contact with boys and girls during puberty.  The rite of passage often termed
""playing Doctor and Nurse"" should not be mistaken for permanent choices of a homosexual or lesbian persuasion.  The compassion demonstrated for Nicholas with the tragic loss of his Father by Adults and other Children must not be overlooked.  I applaud Jeff Sutton's portrayal of a Boy in trauma and pursuit of emotional recovery to move on in life.  Nevertheless I shun completely the notion this movie represents a boy choosing a gay way of life.  Nonsense!  Give the Boy a chance to grow up and arrive at an adult decision!  In fact I would highly recommend this movie for a family that has just suffered the loss of a Paternal Parent to promote discussion about the loss, acceptance and moving on with life.",1444608000,,2322,4.71039603960396
8222017,5,B000WB8PCC,"This film sensitively but starkly illustrates the fears, confusion, yearnings and sense of exclusion that a boy can feel when coming to terms with himself and the life around him. The seemingly tangential nature of the symbolism in this film is a mirage; We are seeing the symbols exactly as a boy of 10 or 12 who feels apart and bereft because of bereavement and his emerging sexual orientation would see them, and the confusion we as viewers feel is his confusion, and the viewer will love this boy, and his friend, but will share their feelings of palpable awkwardness at the same time. This film is a rare treat of an opportunity to relive our own days of awkwardness and come to understand them better through adult eyes, and maybe even remember those times fondly.",1400716800,,770,4.669117647058823

8222019,4,B000WB8PCC,"I recently watched ""The Nature of Nicholas"" for a second time. I really enjoyed the film up to the point where Nicholas kisses his friend Bobby. After that, the movie becomes surreal and disturbing. I have read reviews about this movie from various reviewers and they don't always agree on the films' meaning. Of course, we know that the surreal images are all in Nicholas' head. They are meant to convey the difficulty a 12-year-old boy is having as he comes to terms with his own sexual feelings. I would have enjoyed the movie more if it had dealt with the subject in a straightforward way. As it is, it is confusing. We understand that Nicholas is attracted to his friend Bobby. But it's hard to understand how the zombie figure fits in to the film. The zombie figure, of course, is just a representation of Nicholas' own confusion about his feelings toward Bobby. But if you watch the film, you can interpret it in several different ways. And to confuse things even more, Nicholas starts seeing and hearing his deceased father telling him things about how he should feel and act. I don't like seeing a movie where I have to guess about how a character is feeling. I want something more concrete. I was going to give this film three stars, but it got four stars only because of the amazing job Jeff Sutton did in the role of Nicholas. He was brilliant and I personally thought he was cute. He was just the right age to play a character who is dealing with his sexual identity. He is just preparing to go into Junior High. If you watch this movie, just be aware that you may not completely understand its meaning, but you can still enjoy it as you see Nicholas struggling with his feelings. You may come up with an interpretation of the film that is different from someone elses. That's okay. We all perceive the idea of sexual identity a little differently. That's what makes the film interesting.",1356220800,,1901,4.545189504373178
8222020,4,B000WB8PCC,"These are the key themes of ""The Nature of Nicholas:""  (Sexual) Identity, Maturity / Growing Up, Friendship, Attraction and Death.  Nicholas is a rather serious-minded, 12-year-old boy who is infatuated with his friend Bobby (also 12).  He wants Bobbie to notice him, but Bobbie is more interested in girls and parties.  Nicholas is jealous, afraid of his feelings and lives in a world that ebbs continually between reality and fantasy.  After he makes the bold move of stealing a kiss with Bobby, Nicholas realizes that he has created a monster.  This monster is personified as a sick/dying Bobby who clings to Nicholas for life and friendship.  Soon we see Nicholas' deceased father, a soldier, returning to his son in visions.  He seems to be manipulating Nicholas' world and all the people in it.  Nicholas struggles between what is real and what is the creation of his own mind and of his own fears.  What is he trying to keep and what is he afraid to let go?  It is a fascinating film.",1195862400,28,991,4.703488372093023
