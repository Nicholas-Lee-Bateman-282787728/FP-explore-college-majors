8102978,4,B000DZG8QW,"This set contains two episodes of Rockey Jones Space Ranger and two episodes of the Flash Gordon TV series, all of which were not previously available in other sets, as far as I know (I have most of the other sets).  So if you're a true Flash Gordon fan or liked any of the other Rocky Jones shows, you'll probably want to add these to your collection.
Rocky Jones:
""Escape into Space""
""Kip's Private War""
Flash Gordon:
""The Lure of Light""
""The Subworld Revenge""
It is cheaply packaged in a cardboard box, but the disc played fine in my Panasonic DVD player.",1214438400,3,558,4.470588235294118
