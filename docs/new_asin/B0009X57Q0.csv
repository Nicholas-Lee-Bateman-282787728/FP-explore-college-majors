8068951,5,B0009X57Q0,"Having grown up as a teen in the 70s; these types of movies are what we got to see on TV.  These types of movies will always hold a place in my heart; it's awesome to see an animal struggling to survive against man and nature and still survive it! Remember, all animals want are food, water and shelter; who are we, as man, to deny them that?",1278115200,2,342,4.029411764705882
8068952,4,B0009X57Q0,"THIS DVD IS AN EPISODE OF AN ABC WEEKEND SPECIAL ENTITLED, ""COUGAR.""
IT'S A GREAT LITTLE FILM...ORIGINALLY BROADCASTED IN THREE (3) PARTS...BUT INCLUDED ON THIS DVD AS ONE FULL-LENGTH PROGRAM!
THE QUALITY OF THE PLAYBACK IS LIKE VHS PLAYBACK, HOWEVER!
BASED ON THE NOVEL, ""AN AMERICAN GHOST,"" BY CHESTER AARON!
THIS IS A VERY RARE DVD AND A GREAT FAMILY ORIENTED PROGRAM WITH A RUNNING TIME OF ABOUT 65 MINS!
I REALLY LIKE THIS SHORT FILM...AND THEREFORE, REGARDLESS OF THE QUALITY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD!",1184803200,10,509,5.0
