3711949,5,B001N77ZRK,"Nearly everything fed to us (pun intended) by the corporate media, the corporate medical industry, and the FDA over the last 50 years or so regarding processed oils, unsaturated fats, saturated fats, cholesterol and trans-fats has been a complete lie. If you want to get healthy get rid of all vegetable oils, refined sugars (especially corn syrup), the processed white flower - get all of that out of your diet immediately. Replace that junk and do what our ancestors did for millennia - they used butter and lard and animals fats - and they didn't have cancer or heart disease. And don't hesitate. Your life depends on it, and this video will explain, no prove, why, with very detailed citations.

You'll drop your risk of heart disease and cancer by probably 80% just by getting those processed, nasty GMO corporate foods: oils  and sugars, sweeteners, refined flours, out of your diet.

Yes, this IS exactly 100% the opposite of everything you've ever been told. And no, I'm not a vegetarian hater, I was one for 6 years - and it can be very detrimental to your health. John Robbins and the Diet for a New America crowd are lying to you. Robbins talks about his family business of Baskin Robbins and how his uncles, etc, died from heart disease from all of that ice cream! Wrong! It wasn't the ice cream, Mr. Robbins, it was the chemicals and SUGAR IN the ice cream that gave them the heart disease and Robbins is either a hack or a disinformationist.

Another good follow up video to this one is ""InGREEDients"".

Enjoy getting your health back. I sure am!",1283126400,32,1560,4.63768115942029
3711950,5,B001N77ZRK,"I highly recommend this DVD.  The format appears to be a powerpoint lecture and it is a very well-done expose on one of the ways America's health has been highjacked by the food and health industries for profit.  It looks at the political behind-the-scenes shenanigans as well as giving the scientific information, as opposed to the hype, on fats.  One of the persons providing information for this lecture was a primary scientist involved in the research on fats many decades ago.  I hope that people who watch this DVD will share the information with their friends and health professionals in their communities -- it's only through grassroots efforts that this kind of information can get out to the public.",1268870400,10,709,4.932773109243698
3711951,5,B001N77ZRK,"This is one of the best exposes out there. It used to amaze me how deceived we are as a people when health is concerned, but not any more. This video even correctly interprets the Framingham Heart Study data, showing how these oils are destroying us. I have many health DVDs, and this one is tied for the best of the group.",1264204800,6,323,4.225806451612903
3711952,5,B001N77ZRK,"Heard her speak on WBAI 99.5 fm and was amazed at what she had talked about....another design/plan by gov agencies to capitalize while we r being destroyed....hoodwinked again....  Great Information. I never thought about ""oil"" being a planned setup but felt that between low fat ""this"" and no sugar ""that""..there would be something more!!!. The pharmaceutical industry is the largest industry and has the power to control the FDA amongst other agencies and she does bring this out...everyone should be aware of this... Great DVD",1256688000,7,529,5.223529411764706

Change your life. Take charge of what you put in your body.
We must manage our own health and not rely on the modern diet.
Share this information.
Not only do I recommend this.
This presentation should be presented to everyone.

8323287,3,B001N77ZRK,"While the materials presented are well researched and the Power Point presentation (which can be obtained from the Weston A Price Foundation) gives a good summary of the dietary mess that the medical establishment and government have created through their demonization of saturated fat and promotion of vegetable oils this is not what I expected when I paid the $24.95 to buy it. The description of the DVD should be clear that this is not a documentary movie but a video of the founding President of the Weston A. Price Foundation giving a power point presentation to an unidentified audience. If you want a history of the behind the scenes machinations that have resulted in the SAD (Standard American Diet) this does a good, if overpriced, job. Note also that the Amazon summary says the length of the DVD is 2 minutes. Not correct, more like an hour though I have not timed it.",1401580800,3,881,4.7272727272727275

8323291,5,B001N77ZRK,"Everyone should watch this video.  It makes you realize we have been lied to about what is nutritional.  As the saying goes ""follow the money""  The FDA, etc.  aren't really concerned about our health they just help the big corporations to keep the money rolling in.",1353715200,2,265,4.695652173913044
8323292,5,B001N77ZRK,"What I really like about this video is that it highlights just how much studies can reveal whatever you want them to reveal.  It does a great job of explaining how we arrived at the notions that are so commonplace today and why doctors prescribe statins as though they are the best drug ever created.  The video also brings in a lot of research to show that there is no direct correlation between high cholesterol and heart disease, let alone that one causes the other.  So to take these foods out of the diet and REPLACE them with unstable fats is quite dangerous.  I am a heath and nutrition counselor in NY and almost every one of my clients has either hormonal imbalances, autoimmune issues, allergies and more (some have all!).  Just as heart disease is modern disease, so are these other health concerns.  What I take from this video is an understanding of traditional ways of eating and how far we've deviated from this while so many diseases have become so common today.  I think it's a great video and highly recommend watching this.",1322870400,4,1042,4.6
8323293,1,B001N77ZRK,"While I agree with a lot of what Ms. Fallon says... It seems that she is guilty of the same cherry-picking and omission that she accuses the mainstream diet industry of doing.  There were also several discrepancies in her logic... A glaring one was when near the end she talks about heart disease being caused by inflammation and uric acid build-up. Wait. Protein metabolism (specifically animal protein metabolism) is highly acid-forming and a huge contributor to inflammation in the body. And what about the fact that we know that consumption of animal protein has increased dramatically beginning in 1900 when refrigeration became more widespread? Or that Americans eat substantially more calories per person today than we ever have in history while at the same time are dramatically less active.

Weston Price the man did not advocate eating large quantities of meat as his foundation does today. He encouraged his own family to follow a lacto-vegatarian diet with occasional fish and marine products. He also never mentions cholesterol or soy once in any of his writings - so demonizing them is an agenda of the foundation that is not actually based on his work.

Trans fats are bad. Hydrogenated fats are bad. No kidding. I honestly don't get the 5-star reviews. Even if I did agree with everything she had to say the presentation was just OK. Definitely not great. Seems to me that the praise may be from friends of the organization and not your average Joe viewer?",1309651200,16,1472,4.92741935483871
