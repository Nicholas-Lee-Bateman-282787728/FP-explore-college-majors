1348984,5,B00004T3BR,"First of all id like to say that after i saw all of Evangelion, including the two movies, I thought that i would never find another anime that gripped me like Eva did. I was wrong. Not only does Cowboy Bebop have great  music and detailed and crisp animation, the story is simply amazing. This  third volume contains, in my opinion, the best episodes yet: Jupiter Jazz.  Cut into two parts, these episodes have everything that good anime should;  action, comedy, drama, and the required air battle. Its the best anime out  there, just take my advice and get it. Watch the series form the begining  though or you may miss a few funny jokes in the later episodes as well as  plot threads sewn in the beginning. GET IT NOW!",963705600,6,720,4.450381679389313
1348985,5,B00004T3BR,"There are two problems with this the Third DVD in the Cowboy Bebop series.
1) the menus do not work in a DVD-rom drive. (But that is why they created the right mouse button.)
2) There are only four episodes instead  of the five that can be found on each of the first two disks.  Which means  that we get only 2 hours of enjoyment instead of 2.5.
On the other hand  there are way too, too many good reasons to purchase this disk to list, but  I will mention the first few.
1) Wonderful animation: it seems a lot of  post-1995 animation is leaning on the crutch of CG animation to cover the  lack of vision and story.  This is not one of them.  What little CG there  is, is used brilliantly and the art only enhances the story.
2) Memorable  stories: just trust me on this one, some are funny, some are deadly  serious, ALL are good.  The director Shoji Kawamori is very talented
3)  Haunting music:  Yoko Kanno is a genius.  Until I can get my hands on the  soundtrack, I leave the DVD playing just to listen to the music.
Buy it  and figure out the other reasons on your own, you won't regret it.  (Unless  of course you buy it without buying the 1st two discs as well.)
I would  also recommend that you purchase an earlier work by Shoji Kawamori which  also has music by Yoko Kanno: Macross Plus.",963100800,4,1297,4.208163265306123
1348986,5,B00004T3BR,"If you're not watching this, you're missing one of the best television series to come down the pipe in a long time. Amazingly well done, very entertaining. Even non-anime fans like it.",963100800,,184,4.78125
1348987,5,B00004T3BR,"The only flaw with the setup of Cowboy Bebop as a whole is that Bandai made a really nasty DVD menu to get through.  It takes a few seconds longer than a normal menu to get from screen to screen, but that wouldn't bother  me, except for the fact that I usually can't wait to get to watching the  series.  The storyline is incredible, the characters are fun, and the  blends of film noir, black comedy, swashbuckling, and so many others make  Cowboy Bebop a totally new genre.",962755200,,475,4.340909090909091

1348990,3,B00004T3BR,"Cowboy Bebop Remix Volume 3 includes the eleventh through fourteenth episodes of the series.  Personally, I thought episode eleven was rather strange, but the remaining episodes on the disc were pretty good.

The only real ""extra"" on this volume is a four-minute interview with Sean Akins, a producer at Cartoon Network.  He was asked about the series' impact on Japanese animation, about how the show was reaching a new adult audience, and he also shared who his favorite character was and why.  It was a decent extra, but it left me wanting more.  I would've either liked to have had a longer interview with Mr. Akins, or perhaps a second interview with someone else involved with the series.",1196208000,,694,4.8474576271186445

1348992,5,B00004T3BR,"A strange amorphous blob is hunting the crew of the Bebop through the dark and spooky confines of their ship, taking them down one by one, first Jet, then Faye...even Ein has gotten attacked and been immobilized by the creature's poison! With no sign of Ed, Spike has to take it upon himself to kill the monster in this funny but suspenseful send-up of the first Alien movie. The next two-part episode starts with the crew (minus Faye, who has jumped ship, taking all their money with her) intercepting a message from a woman named ""Julia"" who Spike has an intense interest in catching up with. He takes off in his fighter as Jet goes down to the planet to find Faye. They unintentionally stumble into a drug deal involving Spike's nemesis Vicious. The last episode ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" involves a hacker that is using the Gate systems which ships use to move around the galaxy to steal millions from electronic bank accounts. Our bounty hunters, with Edward in the lead, attempt to track down the elusive mastermind of the scheme.

What's to complain about when it comes to Bebop? The cinematic feel and lack of static action shots with moving backgrounds set this show way apart from other anime. Even watching it 8 years after it was produced, it still shines! You get a little more background on Spike and Vicious in the Jazz episodes but you still feel as though there are unspoken volumes about these characters. The lack of bug-eyed typical anime characters also makes this show appeal to more adult audiences and even non-anime lovers. The humor and the director's passion for films in general really comes through, and the experience is even better in the new 5.1 remix. The only extra on the disk is an interview with Cartoon Network Producer Sean Akins.",1145145600,,1763,4.742671009771987
1348993,5,B00004T3BR,"This is (also) a review of the REMIX VERSIONS. I won't go into the awesomeness of Cowboy Bebop other than to say that it is the best anime series ever, I'd even call it one of the best television shows ever!

While it has been universally noted on various postings about the remix versions that the sound is significantly better than the original sessions, there are multiple varying reviews on the PICTURE QUALITY. Some say there is no difference at all, some say it's a bit better, some say it's a lot better, all say they have ""checked"" both versions. Well, I took it a step further. I watched both versions side by side on an Avid Nitris Professional video editing system with high definition high resolution (HDHR) monitors and here is the DEFINITIVE ANSWER. There is a difference, they lightened it and did a very slight color correction. Basically, the old versions were a bit dark and some of the detail went unnoticed while the remix versions are lighter and there is more visible detail and color. In terms of viewing expeirience this means that a majority of the scenes look noticibly (if marginally) better. There are certain scenes, however, where the lightness works against it. Some of the more noirish scenes look a bit bleedy. Overall I would say that there is a difference in video quality and that the difference is mostly an improvement. But, even to the die hard fan the difference is negligible.

If you don't own the originals, if they're scratched, if you're a huge fan, if you have an awesome theatre system with good surround, or if you have a crappy small tv and can't see the detail in the image, GET THE REMIX. If not, while they are cool, they're not worth the $30 a pop.",1133827200,20,1701,4.592105263157895
1348994,5,B00004T3BR,"Cowboy Bebop has long had a reputation of being one of the best animes out there. I personally thought it was overrated when I started watching it, but lo and behold, I found myself loving it. Session 3 is rather an eclectic mix of moods and genres, but it works for some reason.

Toys in the Attic is the first episode and one of the funniest in the entire series. While the ship is under attack by a strange alien creature, Spike is left trying to figure out how to defeat it all by himself. Most of the humor stems from Spike's rather adled attempts to locate and kill the alien, one of which involves a blowtorch. The real source of the problem is comical and the whole episode brings a smile.

Jupiter Jazz 1&2 are the centerpieces of Session 3. We learn how irrational Spike still is when it comes to Julia. We learn Faye really wants a place to belong. We also learn a little more about Vicious. I personally don't understand why anyone would want to aggravate a character with that sort of a name, it seems like asking for trouble, but Vicious shows his hand a little to Spike. Vicious is an odd villain mainly because you know at one time he had to be likable at least, since Spike, Julia and Gren all seemed to have been friends with him, but Vicious makes it clear that with Spike and Julia's perceived betrayal, everything is meaningless to him. Jupiter Jazz also introduces Gren, one of the most memorable and likable minor characters in anime. Gren is different in many ways and his fate is ultimately what underscores these episodes. There is also some of the most beautiful music to go along with it.

Bohemian Rhapsody is a mystery episode with the whole crew pitted against a criminal mastermind with a twist and a poigniant ending.

Everyone watches Bebop for the music to some degree and this session has incredible music, most of it coming from Jupiter Jazz. Those episodes alone are worth watching.",1097712000,,1920,4.524495677233429
1348995,5,B00004T3BR,"This session, besides having a 2-parter episode, is very cool.  here's why
11: Toys in the Attic: Bebop's horror movie episode, so kewl because.. well, you'll just have to watch it.  The especially funny part is where the monster onboard the Bebop came from.
12: Jupiter Jazz, Part 1: Spike-isode.  This episode has little to do with any of the cast but Spike and Faye.  Watch this episode if you want to see some serious ass-kicking, when someone tells Spike ""You're Vicious"".
13: Jupiter Jazz, Part 2: Spike-isode.  Continuation of the last episode, picking up where it left off.  The ending is a bit anticlimactic, but it has the only scroll-up-through-space credit sequence other than the last episode (no peeking as of now, watch the series in order).
14: Bohemian Rhapsody: Regular episode, almost stereotypical.  This doesn't ruin it's power, just helps make the norm more easily felt out.
Oops, I apparently said the cast/crew interviews were in Session 2, and they're actually here in 3.  I'll have to take a look and see what the hell is in Session 2.  Anyway, the reviews make up for this session only having 4 episodes.",1066608000,,1131,4.818652849740933
1348996,5,B00004T3BR,"The other two being Sessions 2 and 6.
This disc contains ""Toys In The Attic"", the funniest episode in the series, The two-part ""Jupiter Jazz"", which was great but not as great as ""The Real Folk Blues"" and ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", possibly Ed's finest hour. :)",1055980800,,255,4.688888888888889
1348997,5,B00004T3BR,"Oh my gosh, I love this DVD! Toys in the Attic is a must-see episode... it's really funny! Oh, and in this episode, you get to see more of Edward's whims and funnies. Ed definitely makes anyone's day better... even the bounty hunters whom which she stays with. Terrific episodes, terrific anime... wow.",1055808000,,302,4.716981132075472
1348998,5,B00004T3BR,"The hardest thing to take about this third volume in the 'Cowboy Bebop' series is that there are only four episodes.  We've been spoiled by the producer's decision to make room for all 26 episodes by cramming five stories in each of the first two disks.  To make up for this we get some extra materials mostly short interviews with actors, director, and staff.  This is all fun, but not the same.  I guess my Bebop addiction has grown out of hand.
'Toys in the Attic' is a hygiene lesson in outer space as a mysterious creature hunts down the members of the Bebop crew, spreading an unknown and seriously debilitating disease.  It's Spike and Ed to the rescue, or... Achoo!... is it?
In the two episodes of 'Jupiter Jazz,' the crew splits up.  Faye absconds with the ready cash and Ed finds references to a woman named 'Julia,' Spike's old lover.  He and Jet come to a terminal disagreement over what to do next and head off in their own directions.  But all paths lead to the town of Blue Crow.  Including some unpleasant visitors from Spike's past.
High tech robberies begin to happen at all the space gates.  Despite a gigantic bounty no one has been able to catch the mastermind, just the little fish.  Ed's ability to push pawns provides a big clue, but the solution proves to be ancient history.
With 14 episodes out of 26 gone this series has yet to do anything second rate.  Character development has been slow, but by now we are used to the team and have come to like them.  Even mercenary Faye and madcap Ed the supergeek.  The stories themselves show considerable originality with no tendency to be repetitive.  Shinchiro Watanabe is demonstrating a sure and capable touch.  Take the time to listen to the Japanese acting.  It is surprisingly strong and gives you a good sense of the emotional content of the story.",1044057600,3,1826,4.569230769230769
1348999,5,B00004T3BR,"There are so many things that can (and have) been said about this series. But here are the things you should know whether you`re hesitating to try it out or thinking about watching it.
For one thing, this series is not like anything else in or outside of its genre. It has often been called ""the anime for anime-haters"". One way it feels so different from other anime series is that instead of having one central plot and moving very slowly from episode to episode and also including many irrelevant things in the process, the episodes are more like individual stories. There is a more important sub-plot that is occasionally addressed, but it`s more like the series shows you four characters and then tells you some random stories about their lives before the tragic ending that everything draws to. And because there are only 26 episodes, there is absolutely no junk in those thirteen hours.
And because the episodes are more like single stories, they are all very different. Because of this you should not see one episode and either think that all the others will be like it or conclude that the series is not for you. Some episodes are very funny, some are intense, some are sad, some are deep and meaningful, some are a little creepy, some are suspenseful, some are touching, and some are just plain ridiculous and crazy.
The last thing you need to know about Cowboy Bebop is that it is cool. It is so cool it hurts. Spike Spiegel, the character that the series keeps the closest eye on, is the coolest man you will ever meet. And with the killer soundtrack that brings it to life, the series is like a delightfully blended mix of the styles of West Side Story, Bruce Lee movies, The Crow, gangster flicks, James Bond, and 2001:A Space Odyssey.
This specific DVD has only four episodes in comparison to some others that have five, but because you get both parts of ""Jupiter Jazz"" you won`t be dissapointed. ""Toys in the Attic"" is also a popular fan favorite that definitely falls into the category of ridiculousness.",1042588800,2,2021,4.648044692737431
1349000,5,B00004T3BR,"Just like the rest of the series, this volume is great.",1036540800,,55,4.090909090909091
1349001,5,B00004T3BR,"""Cowboy Bebop"" is one of the few anime series out today that can honestly boast character development as one of its biggest draws. While anime like the wonderful ""Vision of Escaflowne"" and the thought-provoking ""Serial Experiments Lain"" all have good character development, ultimately it's their stories and/or ideas that they are remembered for. In turn, while ""Cowboy Bebop"" has everything an anime fan could want, ultimately it's the excellent character development that draws us in, as is beautifully demonstrated in Session 3 of the series.
After several bizarre adventures and picking up a new crewmember, the crew of the Bebop take a little time to gaze into the past of Spike during the two-part episode ""Jupiter Jazz"". While not as intriguing or revealing as ""Ballad of Fallen Angels"", ""Jupiter Jazz"" still manages to project the original noir-like flair the series is famous for. The other two episodes are all lone-standing episodes, yet they are wonderfully crafted and beautifully directed. The viewer truly sympathizes with the characters, thanks to outstanding story direction, and there's rarely a dull moment. The fact that each and every episode has the possibility of being someone's favorite really shows the creators' dedication to the series.
Visually, ""Cowboy Bebop"" looks just as good as it did when it started, if not better. Using a blend of traditional artwork and CGI effects, the end result is a marvelous masterpiece that outperforms many of today's anime series. The level of detail is breathtaking, and the character models still remain eye-pleasing and dynamic. In short, there's little chance of the eye-candy growing old.
Sound wise, sound effects are top notch, but it's the dub that truly shines. By now, the English cast members of ""Cowboy Bebop"" have gotten into their characters so much that we believe they ARE that character. The dub is played to perfection, so much that it is an often cited example of a dub done right to the point where it's considered better than the Japanese track. And Yoko Kanno, with her varied and eclectic talents, continues to craft masterpieces of music that everyone can appreciate and love.
All in all, Session 3 continues the tradition that ""Cowboy Bebop"" started with the first two sessions and continues it with a bang. It treats us to a haunting (albeit limited) view of Spike's past and teases us with what lies ahead. And after the show's stellar run so far, we certainly won't pass up the opportunity to press on. No one can do what ""Cowboy Bebop"" does, so no one can do it better than ""Cowboy Bebop"".",1027900800,2,2581,5.004651162790697
1349002,5,B00004T3BR,"Cowboy Bebop is hands down the best anime series I've seen in a long time. The Session 3 dvd offers a whole lot of bang for your buck. With two of the most humerous episodes and two of the most serious one's. Get this even if you arn't an anime fan.
Session 11: A mysterious virus has infected the Bebop, and Spike and Ed are the only one's who can stop it.
Session 12: Jet and Spike wake up and find that Faye has left the Bebop and taken all its money. When Ed searches for her, Spike finds where his lost love could be. Spike takes off, leaving Jet to find Faye. Vicious is also involved.(Warning: brief nudity)
Session 13: Spike finds Vicious at the end of his search for Julia, and Jet finds Faye. Now its up to Spike to find where Julia is, and stop Vicious.

1349003,5,B00004T3BR,"I've nearly concluded viewing the final episodes of this ground-breaking anime, but i hate to call it that. Bebop is so visually dynamic in comparison to other anime programs it should have it's own name. When you begin to let yourself become encompassed by this unlimitless world you almost forget your even watching what others would assume as ""just a cartoon."" What makes Bebop so brilliant is how the show mocks itself as if it's always been around, yet creates the genre it's mocking right before your eyes. ""Cowboy Bebop"" in a sense knows it's not like anything else.
  Another superior element of the show are its characters. The characters are so incredible in the way they deal with the the normality of their situation. The main chracter's ""Spike"" self-deprevating humor{in the most crucial of situations}is so cool. The whatever attitude he exibits along with his unshakeable confidence makes him an enjoyable chracter to try and relate to. Jet, Faye, Ed, and Ein all have dynamic traits you just don't see from chracters not flesh toned. You can feel the drama and the atmosphere of each situation in Bebop. Finally the visuals of the show are great. Sometimes it's eye-boggling computer graphics or super-precise drawn action sequences that continue to change up and gives you fresh-ness of styles within a fresh new episode.

Of the six disks, this one is my favorite, simply for episodes (sessions) 12 & 13.  The duo Jupiter Jazz episodes add so much more dimension and character development to an already near perfect drama.
When you look at the detail put into this series and listen to the QUALITY, QUALITY voice acting and perfect dub, it's very easy to forget that you are watching an Animated series.
When you cave in and buy this series, you will notice a diffence in the writing for Jupiter Jazz.  A Fantastic Character, Gren.. and his traumatizing past, is introduced to the crew of the bebop and really really plays with your thoughts.

1349007,5,B00004T3BR,"Cowboy Bebop is, in this reviewer's opinion, the finest series that anime currently has to offer. The animation is top-notch, the writing is consistently excellent, the English voice work is amazingly good, and the soundtrack (provided by Yoko Kanno) is absolutely brilliant throughout the entire series. It's a pity that the series had such a short run-- what's available in these six DVD volumes constitutes the entire twenty-six episode series. Nevertheless, this is one series every anime fan must have, and a series I would also recommend to fans of TV shows such as Miami Vice.
  Cowboy Bebop's basic structure allows each episode to be a full-fledged story all its own, with the main characters-- Spike, Jett, Faye, and Edward-- serving to connect them all. While there is a consistency to the entire series outside of the characters-- mainly concerning each character's exploration of his/her identity-- this is a more episodic anime series than something such as Evangelion, and yet far less formulaic than Dragon Ball Z and its brethren. I cannot stress how incredibly good the writing is here-- each episode is a self-contained story full of integrity: sometimes dramatic, sometimes sad, sometimes funny, but always effective each time without sacrificing any of the show's core values.
  Each DVD disc in this series is a bargain-- five episodes per disc for Volumes One and Two, and four episodes per disc thereafter. Extras are limited, but the video quality is outstanding, and both Japanese/English tracks are provided, with English subtitles. The English voice acting is very impressive--  dialogue is still intelligent following the translation, lip synching is dead-on, and the voice actors are almost as endearing as the characters they portray.
  Volume Three is the first in this six-disc series to feature four episodes instead of five, but it makes up for this quite well-- the episodes on this disc are almost all gems, even relative to the rest of the series. Volume Three begins with ""Toys in the Attic"", a semi-parody of the movie Alien which takes itself seriously until its hilarious conclusion. Following this is the two-part episode, ""Jupiter Jazz"", in which we learn a little more about Spike's past and view Faye in a surprising new way. This episode alone makes Volume Three a required purchase for fans of the show-- the music is some of the best yet, the character interaction is deeply involving, and there is some excellent action towards the end. The final episode here, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", is entertaining and intelligent but somewhat empty compared to its three predecessors on this volume.

The comedy, the adventure but nothing prepared me for this DVD.  It was EXCELLENT.  The BeBop crew continue their adventures in space and in life.
The first episode had that fractured view of space and reality that has made Bebop a classic.  The second and third episodes were the first twopart episodes of the series and unrivaled in their storytelling ability.  The last random addition to the crew Ed brings a sense of the surreal to the crew's lives but in a positive kinda way.  The series continues to get better and better.

Toys in the Attic is a silly, humor-filled episode with an emphasis on Ed and Spike. The plot itself takes a back seat to the jokes in this episode, and the silliness is good, because they'll be no laughter in....
Jupiter Jazz, which is the first of two 2-parters in Cowboy Bebop dealing with Spike's past. Vicious (from Episode 5, DVD #1) returns and is confronted by Spike. Faye encounters a surprising man...or is it woman...or is it neither? Plus, intrigue and mentions of Julia, the mysterious woman in the credits to Cowboy Bebop. The animation here is superb, the story is complex, and the characters are deep. Quite possibly the best episodes before DVD #6, the last DVD.
Bohemian Rhapsody is a self-contained episode about...chess. Yes, chess. This is a team episode, though it's really more about Ed. The story here is pretty interesting, as is the villain, and the episode manages to have a subtle humor not evident in Toys in the Attic.

But it  turns out that his old enemy Vicious is  involved. Finally, they must solve the  mystery of a high-tech crime that  seems to  have been perpetrated by a  ghost.",966643200,2,585,4.73

The two  part Jupiter Jazz episode is amzingly cool there's like this one part were  Spike beats up alot of guys, and that's always cool. Great Music, Great  Action, Great Session.

 Cowboy Bebop the best series ever I liked it so much I'm  gonna buy sessions 4,5,and 6 too.
  Following my friend Justin I must  recommend the anime Kite because it is good.",965520000,,624,4.433628318584071
1349016,5,B00004T3BR,"Now, to some people, that may be a crazy thing to say, but ILOVE my Bebop!
So far I have seen sessions 1-3, and I think that the ""Jupiter Jazz"" episodes in this DVD are some of the most interesting, touching, and heartfelt episodes of any show that I have seen in a long time... except for a certain ... *hurumph* ""fellow"" ...  if you have seen this episode, you know what I am talking about ;-)
The soundtrack of Cowboy is also an amazing element in the story - the music is ALWAYS dead on in it's mix of jazz and other contemporary music styles. In fact I love the music so much, that just yesterday I ordered 3 of the Bebop soundtracks (OST 1, OST 2, and Blue) and I really can't wait to get my hands on them - if you want a taste, just go on Napster and look for ""Cowboy Bebop."" Great stuff!
I recommend this to ANYONE who likes an amazing blend of John Woo-esque gunplay, deep, involving characters and a dash of humor.
If you liked Bebop, I also recommend the anime ""Kite.""...",965088000,5,982,4.168421052631579

All four are great episodes. From the comedic ""Toys In The Attic"" to the melodramatic ""Jupiter Jazz"" to the tripped out 'whodunit' ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". Thoroughly entertaining.",1440892800,,264,5.6

7922263,5,B00004T3BR,"In 2071, man has colonized many of the planets in our solar system. People from all walks of life roam free. Violence, freedom, love, hate, and every other aspect of human nature is rampant across the galaxy. Those that capture wanted criminals are called cowboys(bounty hunters). Spike, Jet, Faye, Edward, and their dog, Ein are the top bounty hunters in the solar system. They all have different pasts, different reasons for being partners, and different fates awaiting them. As their pasts come back to haunt them, can they survive and keep their friendship strong, while at the same time making a living catching bad guys?

Cowboy Bebop is an anime legend. It's probably one of the best ever. I don't know if it makes my top 10 list or anything, but it's darn close, and a must see for any anime fan, or fan of super cool action shows. This series has great animation, voice acting, soundtrack, and plot. The story has a very methodical nature. Most of the episodes are about them chasing different bad guys. There are a few that link together as a continuous story, especially toward the end, but it's a show that can keep your attention by changing the mood frequently. I can't say enough good stuff about this series. It's definitely a favorite of anime fans across the globe. You can't miss Cowboy Bebop.",1353974400,,1312,4.7043478260869565
