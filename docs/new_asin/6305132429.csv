974487,5,6305132429,"Henry Fonda was at the top of his game when he did these one man shows in the 1970s & Clarence Darrow became a personal hero of mine when I read Irving Stone's CLARENCE DARROW FOR THE DEFENSE when I was 11 or 12. I was fortunate to see two performances, one in Los Angeles and the other in Chicago. I marveled at how precise Fonda was from performance to performance, a true artist at the height of his career. HERE we are lucky enough to be able to re experience this treasure over and over.

Clarence Darrow came to Chicago from a tiny town in Ohio from two very unusual parents. His father was constantly<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CLARENCE-DARROW-For-The-DEFENSE/dp/B000NYHKBU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CLARENCE DARROW For The DEFENSE</a>&nbsp;busy with the underground railroad and would take young Clarence along as much as he could. Clarence's mother was a free thinker who was an early advocate for birth control and women' rights (WE'RE TALKING 1840s-1860!!).

Clarence started off in Chicago representing big business, but before he knew it , he became a labor lawyer, always taking the impossible cases and as he got older his choices towards more notorious cases such as ""The Scopes Monkey Trial"" in which he defended the teaching of evolution and ""The trial of Leopold & Loeb"" who killed little Bobby Franks for the thrill of it, Darrow tried to a judge to try to spare their lives.

The junction of two lives, Fonda whose greatest roles were Tom Joad, Young Abe Lincoln, Mister Roberts, the president in FAIL SAFE, the head juror in 12 ANGRY MEN and Clarence Darrow who always took on the hardst fight is a match worth seeing and adding to your DVD collection.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Henry-Fonda-s-Clarence-Darrow/dp/B000CQQIUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Henry Fonda's Clarence Darrow</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Henry-Fonda-s-Clarence-Darrow/dp/B000CQQIUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Henry Fonda's Clarence Darrow</a>",1261958400,8,2065,5.946127946127946

I liked it then, and I wouldn't mind seeing it again at all, but I think the price for this item is way out of my budget for a DVD that I would not watch more than once every few years. I saw Henry Fonda on Broadway in a forgettable comedy a few years earlier than this venture, and he was as impressive on a stage as he was on film. But you can buy two or three of his best film performances for the price of this item.

Although he gave some brilliant performances on  film such as ""The Grapes of Wrath"", ""On Golden Pond"", ""Once Upon A Time in the West"" and ""12 Angry Men"", Fonda shined even  brighter on a stage---he even  remarked that the stage version of his ""Mister Roberts"" was superior to the film version.

the important cases that Darrow supported and the ideals he stood for are very important to the social
history of America.  In fact after seeing this DVD, I think Henry Fonda should have played the role of
Atticus in ""To KIll A Mocking Bird"".  I feel that Henry Fonda's mindset and intellect are more in line
with that role than anyone else's.
Its unfortunate that polyester suits were popular at the time Henry Fonda acted this role because

974691,5,6305132429,"In 1975, Henry Fonda performed this monologue, live, in various cities across the U.S.  This is a film version of his live theatre performances.

The screenplay (monologue) is based on Irving Stone's 1971 biography:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clarence-Darrow-for-the-defense-A-biography-A-Bantam-biography/dp/B0007DRVZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clarence Darrow for the defense: A biography (A Bantam biography)</a>.

I had the privilege of seeing Mr. Fonda perform this live monologue at the Cleveland Playhouse Theater in 1975.  I was young, and it was an inspiring influence.

I am really glad to know that someone made a film record of his performances, and, that it is available.

Clarence Darrow, as a labor lawyer, a criminal defense lawyer, and as a humanitarian, did much to raise the consciousness of our people as to the plight of the common man during the great depression.  Fonda, as an actor, contributed to this consciousness in some of the roles he played after the depression and through WWII.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Grapes-of-Wrath/dp/B0000DJZ8R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Grapes of Wrath</a>&nbsp;(John Ford Directed this 1940 film).  Together, Clarence Darrow's life and Henry Fonda's inspiring performance, lead us to understand how social consciousness is necessary in our current political, social and economic climate in the US.

The monologue is filled with compelling arguments for compassion towards even the most disfavored citizens of our Country, and, it is filled with witty and inspiring quotes from Clarence Darrow:

""As long as the world shall last there will be wrongs, and if no man objected and no man rebelled, those wrongs would last forever.""

""I don't like spinach, and I'm glad I don't, because if I liked it I'd eat it, and I just hate it.""

One of the vignettes in the monologue involves Darrow being confronted by a young reporter who remarked that Darrow always looked unkempt and disheveled.  Darrow responded:  ""Young man, I spend just as much money on my attire as you - the difference between us is that you take off your clothes when you go to sleep.""

We easily lose sight of history without inspiration from protagonists such as Darrow, or, performers such as Henry Fonda.  We, as a nation, have lost sight of the freedoms we have abandoned in favor of ""law and order"" or ""trickle down economics.""  ""Law and Order, and ""trickle down economics"" are not new ideas.  They are the same ideas from the Great Depression that were used to oppress the common people, and preserve the abundance of this Nation for a select few.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-Have-and-Have-Not-Scribner-Classics/dp/0684859238/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To Have and Have Not (Scribner Classics)</a>&nbsp;[Hemingway 1937].

An unfair sampling of talent is obvious but the truth is with very few exceptions, Fonda was always a dynamo when it came time to ante up in the thespian game. A natural. It's hard to say whether the people who pick our stars got bad at what they do or the level of acting expertise has fallen. This piece was on P.B.S. the first time i saw it. Purchased it in v.h.s. when it became available and now in d.v.d. Darrow, whether portrayed by Spencer Tracy or Fonda was an American ""one off."" John Houseman did a really good job in direction of this play. How much of the story line is hyperbole and how much reality i do not know but it is fun to watch. Kinda fun like watching Lee Marvin in ""Paint your wagon."" There is another American icon but enough of that. Suffice to say that we have passed through the twentieth century thinking that great actors would be available any time we cared to see greatness. That is not so.
