8099019,5,B000CGYOKY,"Best shooting video out there. Researched lots of videos and articles on YouTube, Instagram, and any webpage I can find on the internet. Tom Nordland keeps it simple and teaches the one motion shot you see prevalent in the NBA today. Follow his instructions and put in those reps to find your OWN shot.",1522972800,,302,4.611111111111111
8099020,5,B000CGYOKY,"I am in my 40s and purchased this video to learn how to teach my teenage son on how to shoot. By following the method and technique outlined in this video I was able to teach my son the fundamentals of shooting a basketball. He did improve his shot and is more confident in playing basketball (he plays occasional competitive organized basketball leagues for his age). More importantly, it also taught me how to shoot the basketball. Please note that even though I play basketball but I don't play competitively and I am not very athletic. However, my average free throw percentage improved to around 70% and many times I can make 8 to 10 free throws consecutively. I would like to reiterate that I am not a great basketball player but I can now shoot better compared to many friends that are more athletic. You just have to be patient and willing to ""unlearn"", ""retool"" and ""relearn"" how to shoot by following the Swish method. This instructional video is highly recommended.",1476230400,,976,4.680232558139535
8099021,4,B000CGYOKY,Good video with a lot of solid shooting thoughts and instruction. The one thing I would have liked to have seen is more time with college and/or pro level players.,1381017600,,163,4.466666666666667
8099022,2,B000CGYOKY,"If you are looking for the basics on how to get someone started shooting this looks like a good video. I tried the principles and steps the video recommends with my son who could actually shoot very well to begin with and it caused problems for him, he started missing way more than he used to. He shot well in practice but the principles did not seem to translate at all into game situations. He is part of a travel team and plays in several 3 on 3 tournaments as well, in a very competitive division.

I thought this video might help make his shot a little better getting ready for school ball, but it did the opposite for him and he got very discouraged. I eventually told him to forget everything in the video and go back to what he was doing and after a couple of games his shot came back. It was too bad we spent quite a bit of time practicing the swish method; I had watched the video 7 or 8 times and took detailed notes before we even started together.

So if you are just starting out this video should help you, but if you have been playing and you already have had some success at shooting skip this DVD and just go outside and practice.

Just to let you know if you get the video be ready to have him push his shooting seminars and other videos, it gets a little old after a while.",1370390400,,1294,4.126984126984127
8099023,5,B000CGYOKY,If your learning to shoot or want to know how to the correct way this video is great. Me and my son practice everyday and his shot is coming along. He has never played before.,1357171200,,175,4.0285714285714285

If I would have had these when my kids were young, so I could practice shooting correctly with them, 4 of my five kids would have not had bad habits that they needed to break.  My youngest, 6 years old, practices shooting correctly and also shooting with two hands(he is not strong enough to make a basket with only one hand yet)  This method is easy to teach, works well and has had great results for all of my kids plus all of the teams I have coached.  I have never seen results so fast with any other shooting video or method as I have seen with this method.  Tom takes the time and walks thru the entire process, how to practice each part and how to then use it for all types of shots.  My best shooting players every year are the players that embrace this method.  I can not recommend this video enough.  I borrow the video to each of my players to go home, watch and practice.  I now own multiple copies of each version.",1352419200,,1626,6.283783783783784
8099026,5,B000CGYOKY,"As a coach for my two sons and two daughters I have purchased just about everything that is sold online.  I have never played basketball and it was frustrating trying to teach them to shoot when  I was a terrible shot.  Within three days and about five hours of shooting both my 14 year old son and I were shooting 75% at the free throw line.  Within a month, we were shooting at least 100% better then when we started.  At the end of last season, I  was so impressed to watch my son can shots from just about everywhere.  I also love the fact that I can now shoot better then any of the coaches at the school and any of the parents at the school.  If you watch the video 6-12 times and practice with your kids or your players they will become great shots.  It takes time and practice but I have seen players on my sons team that could not make a shot under the basket score double digits within 4-5 games and 4-5 practice sessions.  If you are willing to invest the time, you will get great results.  If you think it is a magic pill and watching it will double your shooting percentage, buy it anyway.  It won't hurt.  I own both Swish and Swish 2.  I would buy both, if you have to buy only one, buy Swish 2.

OK, time to add to the update.  I used the Swish 2 method and taught my 4th grade tournament team how to shoot correctly.  We only had five practices and I used three of the practices to teach and all of the practices to keep them from reverting to their old way of shooting.  50% of the team had it click in the three, 3 hour sessions that I spent on it.  One of my players who could not shoot to save his soul during the regular season was double digits all four games during the tournament.  He took a three point shot(which we did not practice because they are 4th graders) with ten seconds left, down by three and almost drained it.  One inch different and it was in.  The two best players on my team lit up the boards and opened up all sorts of opportunity because they now needed to be guarded both inside and outside.  My point guard went 9-10 at the free throw line.  He never went 50% during the season.

It will take three full practices and you will need to remind your players every practice to warm up and use good form but they will get it and then they are un-stoppable.  I canb't wait for next season.",1254614400,5,2330,4.110864745011087
8099027,5,B000CGYOKY,"My teenage daugther plays basketball for her school. The entire team has problems with shooting consistency. While I had played years ago, I was having problems explaining to her how to get more strengh into her shots and be more consistant in her aim. I ordered this Cd so my daughter could at least see someone shooting properly. I got more than I bargained for.
After just going through the CD once, my daughter picked up on many of the principles taught in the lessons. Within a week she was shooting better.
I watch her on the court now and I see her using what she has been taught. She is not where she wants to be in her shooting, but her confidence has shot through the roof and is on her way to being a solid shooter.
The CD is not a miricle worker, but it will take someone with basic talent and teach them a shooting style that is proven and works. As I watch games on TV I myself can see swish principles at work in other players. It's worth the investment if you want to improve your shooting skills.",1201046400,2,1013,4.253886010362694
