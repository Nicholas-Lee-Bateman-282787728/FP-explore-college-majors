8482847,2,B005Q1XVOU,"Review of The Blue Lagoon
Hot Toasty Rag, July 23, 2017

Did you know the 1980 version of Blue Lagoon was a remake? I didnt, either. As it turns out, none other than the usually prudish Jean Simmons played in the original! Obviously, this version was a lot less filthy than the remake, and there wasn't any nudity, but for 1949, it was incredibly daring. Jean and her costar Donald Houston were practically clad in loincloths the entire movie, and the actor and actress who played them as children were actually topless during their island scenes.

In case you don't know the story, two children and a deckhand survive a shipwreck in a tiny lifeboat. They find an uninhabited island, and while they don't give up hope of being rescued, they settle in and make a home. As the years pass and the childrens hormones kick in, nature takes over and they start to notice each other.

Its the proverbial fantasy, stranded on a desert island with the love of your life, but The Blue Lagoon is actually a pretty sad story. They were children when they were stranded, and it wasn't by choice. They miss their families and long for contact with the outside world. They have no idea where they are, and have very little hope of being found and rescued.

Although it was very nasty for its time, and although it shows a completely different performance from Jean Simmons, I don't really recommend this one. The remake is just as sad, if not more so, but with a lot more nudity and sex, so I cant really recommend that one, either.

DLM warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, there are some scenes in this movie that won't be your friend. The camera bobs about during the boat and canoe scenes, and it might make you sick. In other words, Dont Look, Mom!",1500768000,,1754,4.50314465408805

Was really looking forward to seeing it again. Now it's no longer offered. I wonder if this was what people were finding on theirs too. Weird.",1411689600,2,293,4.25

I LAST SAW IT ON T.V. WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER DURING THE 1960'S. SOOOO GLAD SOMEBODY HAD RECORDED THIS BACK IN THE DAY AT HOME, IT'S INFINATELY BETTER THAN NO COPIES AT ALL----AND DOES PLAY WELL ON MANY OF MY DVD PLAYERS !! I HOPE SOMEONE RESPONSABLE FOR OLD FILMS MADE IN ENGLAND GETS COPIES OF THIS AND ATTEMPTS TO RESTORE THIS GEM. WAY MORE REALISTIC (for a movie) THAN THE MODERN VERSIONS AND AS A TRIBUTE TO JEAN SIMMONS !",1404518400,7,598,4.254385964912281
