1722692,5,B0000687GC,"My 20 month old son loves the Cedarmont Kids sing-alongs!  I highly recommend Cedarmont Kids toddler tunes, preschool songs, and silly songs.  Please, please skip all the Singing Babies Dvds and buy Cedarmont kids instead you'll thank me!",1114041600,8,238,5.2368421052631575
1722693,5,B0000687GC,"My daughter is 23 months old, and she has loved pretty much all the DVD's in the Cedarmont Kids series since she was about 1 year old.  They really hold her attention, and she likes to dance to the music.  This one and ""Silly Songs"" seem to be 2 of her favorites.  We also have several of the cassettes.  I think this is a wonderful series for children.",1096070400,15,353,4.147058823529412
1722694,5,B0000687GC,"When our daughter started out-growing her favorite Baby Einstein videos we decided to order a few new ones.  We wanted to get something with music so we picked a couple of Sesame Street videos and Toddler Tunes because it was highly rated here.  She absolutely LOVES this video and could watch it repeatedly all day long.  It's a very nicely done series of music videos shot on various locations with young kids dressing up and singing along to the music - not obnoxious and not commercial or phony at all.  The kids genuinely seem to be having fun.
I checked the [...] website (where you can find a list of all the songs, by the way).  These videos are produced by a small church group in Tennessee and the kids in the videos are the ones doing the singing.  While many of their videos are collections of religious songs, this one isn't (except for one little innocuous song that didn't bother me).
All the songs on the DVD are sung both in English and in Spanish, with the option of sing-along subtitles in both languages.
I highly recommend this video: it won't rot your kid's brain, it's fun to listen to and it won't drive you nuts after a hundred repeated viewings.  I just bought several more Cedarmont Kids videos.",1076371200,21,1222,4.527272727272727
1722695,5,B0000687GC,"I have 3 DVD's in this series, and toddler tunes is my favorite. My 12 month old loves to watch and dance along. I like him watching real kids do kid stuff instead of cartoon figures. The songs have great messages and are the ones I grew up with. (I am learning a lot of 2nd and 3rd verses that I didn't know existed.) A must have for anyone with kids.",1044835200,19,352,3.971830985915493

1722707,5,B0000687GC,"Lots of good gospel and secular songs. There is a good selection, and the kids are adorable. It is sweet without being corny or hokey (to me). My kids (3 and 9 months) don't agree on much, but they both seem entranced by this video.",1357948800,,232,4.177777777777778
1722708,5,B0000687GC,"From the first time we played this DVD for our grandson and for the past year he has enjoyed this DVD immensely.  He is mesmorized by it.  It holds his attention for the entire DVD.  The songs are done beautifully by the kids. It has the old fashion songs we grew up with ourselves, such as ""Jack and Jill"", ""The Wheels on the Bus go round and round"", ""Polly Put the Kettle on"".  You won't be disappointed.  The kids are adorable in this video and the quality is great. Our grandson has autism and this DVD seems to reach him.  Highly recommended, especially since he has not grown tired of it.",1321401600,,594,4.306306306306307

1722710,5,B0000687GC,"This DVD has almost all the familiar toddler tunes/nursery rhymes that are sung by children who can sing greatly in tune! As far as I know, this is the best DVD of its kind in the market. The visual component of the DVD is also child friendly, innocent, and happy. Two enthusiastically thumbs up!",1304553600,,296,4.5
1722711,5,B0000687GC,My 1 1/2 year old grandson loves the songs and the children singing them.  Old fashion fun.,1263686400,,91,4.352941176470588
1722712,5,B0000687GC,"I got this for my 18 month old.  She's now 36 month old and still enjoys it.  The kids are filmed on location doing fun kid activities and they all look like they are enjoying themselves as they sing.  None of the songs include weird/scary lyrics.  I like the option of displaying the lyrics at the same time so that I can learn the songs and sing to her when we're not watching the DVD.  Also, as someone who has perfect pitch, I appreciate hearing kids sing in tune.  (I own other Cedarmont Kids videos and know that these kids are really singing themselves, albeit recorded in a studio).

There are two things that I can think of that some parents might not like.  First, 4 out of 25 songs are religious.  Here's the song list:

The Wheels on the Bus * The Alphabet Song * Polly, Put the Kettle On * God Made Me * Eensy, Weensy Spider * Deep and Wide * The More We Get Together * Six Little Ducks * Mulberry Bush * Baa, Baa, Black Sheep * Roll Over * Old MacDonald * Father, We Thank Thee * Are You Sleeping? * Jack and Jill * Oh, Where, Oh, Where Has My Little Dog Gone? * Get on Board * Oh Dear! What Can the Matter Be? * Pop! Goes the Weasel! * This Old Man * London Bridge * Mary Had a Little Lamb * The Muffin Man * Row, Row, Row Your Boat * Be Kind to Your Web-Footed Friends

The last song is short and a bit weird.

Second reason that some very very picky musician parents might not like is that the style of the singing can get monotonous.  This is not an apparent deficiency when you watch the kids perform on the DVD but will become apparent if you listen to the CD for many times w/o the visual distraction.  What do I mean by monotony?  If you compare the same songs by Cedarmont Kids to let's say, Raffi's version, you'll notice that Raffi interprets his song much more and uses different styles/voices to ""tell"" a story.  Still, I wouldn't knock off a star for that because I realize that these songs are done by kids and the production overall is very good.

A worthwhile investment.  My kid loves it and still sings with it.",1260230400,10,2044,4.131645569620253
1722713,5,B0000687GC,The baby I gave this to is going to be happy for sure.  Every child I know of that has the Cedermont sing a long dvds just love them.,1238803200,,133,3.586206896551724

7963830,4,B0000687GC,"My daughter loves the music on this and is learning so many songs.  I'm happy she likes it.  I like to be able to sing along with her and teach her the songs she doesn't know and it helps that the lyrics come with the CD. With so many songs, it's not constantly listening to the same songs over and over again and that makes me happy.",1452124800,,334,3.970149253731343

7963832,2,B0000687GC,"Was not the same DVD as pictured. I have the DVD pictured, but it is scratched and skips, so I wanted an exact duplicate. I even compared UPCs to make sure I was getting an identical DVD. Well, guess what....it is NOT the same DVD. The cover is different, the UPC is different, and some of the songs are different. So even though the advertised DVD was just what I wanted, I did NOT receive this DVD (and I ordered two of them, one to give as a gift!). I am VERY disappointed.",1418515200,,476,4.129032258064516
