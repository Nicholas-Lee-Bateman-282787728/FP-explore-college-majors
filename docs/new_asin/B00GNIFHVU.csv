You can find Volumes 1,2, and 3 on their web-site"" MathTutorDVD.com at less expensive and bulk discount prices. They offer training DVD's on other topics as well. Lessons are highly engaging and well planned, and you can review them as often as needed and do exercises at own pace to fully grasp various JAVA topics. Highly recommended!!!. I purchased all 1 volume at a higher price, and other 3 volumes from vendor at a bulk discount!!!.",1525392000,,575,4.877551020408164
