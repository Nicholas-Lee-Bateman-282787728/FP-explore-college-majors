8135735,4,B000H0M42A,"The 'good old days' were not so good if suffered from a malady requiring surgery, nor any better for other afflictions since most of them were treated by eg. bloodletting and other quackery that rarely helped. Doctors usually achieved their 'education' by performing mundane tasks such as caring for an established doctor's horse, etc., not through education. (Regardless, little was known to convey via formal education.) Even as recent as the 1940s, a president (FDR) suffered and died from high-blood pressure and stroke - lacking the helpful medications of today.",1387065600,,567,5.311111111111111
8135736,4,B000H0M42A,"I thought this work was very complete.  It spoke of how some men went to medical schools, but some learned as apprentices, and some were quacks.  Medical practices that I thought were abandoned in the Dark Ages were still being practiced in the 1700s.  Famous people came up:  George Washington died of bloodletting; Lewis and Clark learned medicine before going on their journey.  Still, common people were brought up as well.  The work said frontier doctors got great experience working on isolated communities and wounded soldiers, but it also says many individuals operated on themselves due to the paucity of doctors.  This work is diverse.  It had male and female interviewees.  It spoke of one African-American man who was recognized for his snake bite concerns.  The work is honest in that it spoke of diseases wiping out Native Americans but also of how frontier settlers had to depend upon Native healing practices too.  We moderns are so used to worshipping at the feet of doctors, so it is surprising to hear of a time when people were skeptical of them and often avoided them.  This would be a great work to show young people interested in entering the medical field.  My one critique is all the cheesy reenactments typical of this cable series.",1181692800,5,1258,4.849765258215962
