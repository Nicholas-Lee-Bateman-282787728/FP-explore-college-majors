The trading routes of old were a scene of many historic battles over rumors of hidden treasures. Sir Henry Morgan had fought and defeated the evil Pirate Jacques Lafitte leaving his galleon shipwrecked in the Caribbean.

However, feeling vunerable to a revenge attack, Morgan enlisted the help of Sir Francis Drake, Blackbeard, Barbarossa, and Captain Scarlet to help him defend the treasure and crush Lafitte once and for all.

Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Pirates Adventure - make sure you watch it, so you don't miss a thing!!!!",1380240000,,682,5.071428571428571
