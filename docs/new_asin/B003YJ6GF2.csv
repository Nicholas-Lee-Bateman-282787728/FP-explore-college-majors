8409452,3,B003YJ6GF2,"Over the years, I've read a lot about William Haines, arguably the first ""out"" Hollywood actor. Louis B. Mayer fired Haines when he refused to give up his male partner and marry a woman for the sake of the studio. So, Haines (once the top box office male lead in Hollywood) is rightly regarded as a hero. But come to find out, his films were, at least for me, kind of dull. He seems to play the same stereotypical character, the ""wise-cracker,"" over and over, like a one trick pony. From a strictly historical perspective, this is interesting but frankly not very entertaining.",1364774400,,577,4.611650485436893
8409453,4,B003YJ6GF2,"Warner Archives give us another William Haines movie - thanks God! I have never seen it before but its really a nice one movie. Of course, William Haines acting is a little bit overacted (comes direct from the silent movie era) and this a early talking movie. Its relative short with only 65 minutes but very entertaining.

The most funny / charming scene is this, when William is leaving the store, running after the woman where is sitting now in her car. She want drive away and he is holding up the car (kneeling) with his finger.

The Story: read the product description or on wikipedia / imdb.

The DVD:

The Picture quality: is not restored / remastered but pretty good!!!!!

The Sound: for a early talking picture and not restored one, not bad!

The only minus point I have with those Warner Archive Collection: no subtitles for deaf hearing people",1305331200,,855,4.629139072847682
