8038086,5,B000641D42,"For fans of Callas, this is about as good as it gets, and you must have it in your library.  The interviews with her, taken out of the context of the whole, make this documentary worth having.  Insecurities and other emotional baggage notwithstanding, Callas knew who Callas was.  She provides an excellent perspective of her place in the art of music and opera specifically.  Her views on art are a revelation.

For fans of opera, but not necessarily Callas--And, yes, she is an acquired taste!--the documentary is instructive on a revolutionary period in the history of opera.  The documentary earns its place as an historical document.

Callas was a teacher on many levels.  Her inspired mentoring of Caballe, for example, contributed much to the body of art we have today.  Without Callas, we may not have had the magnificence of Caballe's ""Norma"".  I only wish there was footage of Callas's master classes.  I wish I knew something about the singers she coached, and where they are today.

Zeffirelli's narrative, handling of the contributing artists. and smooth transitions among archival footage and interviews are especially fine.  Zeffirelli, himself, understates, rather than overstates his case.  One has the sense that one is seeing and hearing the truth.  Caballe's thankful tribute, however brief, was lovely.  Gobbi's anecdotal comments will bring an iceberg to tears.  Gobbi, all by himself, provided such an insight into Callas's inner being.

Enough!  Read the other reviews! Then, buy it!",1250812800,12,1507,5.178423236514523
8038087,5,B000641D42,"This is a documentary that has all the right ingredients.  Old colleagues, peers, and rivals reminisce.  There are archival operatic scenes showing the amazing talent of Maria Callas. There is footage of her interviews.

Maria Callas was not only a great soprano but also one of the best operatic actresses I have ever seen.  The ""Vissi d'arte"" aria alone  (from ""Tosca"") is worth the price of the DVD.  She was the queen of the most famous opera in the world, La Scala in Milan.

Franco Zefferelli does a wonderful job as narrator. A great director himself, he directed Callas in one of her greatest performances as Tosca.  The documentary also covers her controversial personal life and the loneliness of being a true prima donna.

The interview footage of her shows an elegant, refined woman totally dedicated to her art and her audience.  I rented this first, and after seeing it, ordered it through Amazon.  You do not have to be an opera fan to really enjoy this.  She was a fascinating woman.",1245715200,3,999,4.744186046511628

John Steane, reviewing in Gramophone

'A revealing portrait of Callas-- the woman and the artist, with her many contradictions

'The film begins with a newsreel of Callas's funeral in Paris, and it is not immediately apparent that it is to be more than an anthology of pious platitudes, oral and visual, assembled and marketed in the emotional floodtide following her then-recent death. Zeffirelli is stationed in the auditorium of La Scala, where he can look towards the stage which `still seems to reverberate with the sound of her voice.' Then we see Callas herself--but not herself, for this is her persona as gracious and glamorous purveyor of artistic truth (as in the assurance that people go the theatre `for something better', there being enough that is sordid and depressing in real life). Then the witnesses arrive, starting with Menotti, who recalls an association with fear and, in her voice, `something bitter'. This is more interesting, but instead of pursuing it the film moves on, as is the way with interviews and interview-based programmes. From Rescigno comes 'a supremely dedicated performer', from Caball `Thank you, Maria, for coming to us,' and from Zeffirelli `She literally changed the face of opera.'

'Yet in spite of the patchwork method and flaccid generalisations, the film does succeed in what were presumably its primary aims--to show the fascination of the woman and the artist, the interaction of the one with the other, and, in doing so, to move its audience with the strange mixture of glorious public achievement and deep personal unfulfilment. Stranger still, perhaps, is the stirring of so many conflicting reactions. In the midst of such insistent testimony, the film footage of Callas `in action' inevitably tests the claims. Does it truly support them? Is that filmed `Vissi d'arte', for instance, really the work of a great operatic actress? Often it rather strengthens the view that with Callas, as with all great opera singers, most of the acting is done with the voice. And yet at the end we are left with her singing `Ah, non credea mirarti' from La sonnambula, where the voice becomes frail and unsteady while the face is transfigured, infinitely touching. No: it's a film not to be missed, and the bonus footage sheds interesting light on its making, especially from John Ardoin, clearly one of its prime movers.'",1207094400,3,5028,5.130647130647131
8038089,5,B000641D42,"This documentary is to remember a great soprano. When you talk about Maria Callas,it's like talking about a costliest gemstone,a jewel. Maria Callas is widely known throughout the World. The best singing actress ever remembered!!!powerful voice,full of vibrations and passions at the same time. Unique and beyond comparisons. Far from the voice,we must look at her also as a person,an artist,the music and a human being like all of us. This entertainment (dvd) contains interviews with some celebrities such as Monserrat Caballe and Renata Tebaldi.
Maria left behind one of the most valuable inheritances to mankind in the world story of music.",1148256000,14,644,5.323529411764706
8038090,5,B000641D42,"The previous reviewer may not realize that this documentary was originally produced in the late 70s for television, after Callas' death.  The footage quality is what one would expect from something of that time and no amount of DVD remastering could fix it.  The DVD has a wealth of information about Callas.  The interviews are particularly fascinating and insightful.",1118188800,25,369,5.220338983050848
8038091,2,B000641D42,"Although the interviews, etc., with and about Callas are excellent and enlightening and very interesting, the technical quality of this DVD is poor, out-of-focus shots, many blurry, and so it is difficult to recommend this dvd.  Why didn't the people responsible for the technical quality use the same equipment and techniques as those by Maximillian Schell when he made the technically perfect and beautiful DVD with Marlene Dietrich, in his documentary about her called, ""MARLENE""?  THIS ""CALLAS"" NEEDS REMASTERING, both picture and sound!",1117497600,8,541,5.506024096385542
