8575260,2,B00BY6XMDG,"I should start by stating I did not buy this DVD from Amazon but from the company that released it. Unfortunately, since there are no subtitles/closed captioning available on this set and I am hearing impaired, I had to return it. Just wanted to give everyone a heads up to let you all know...
Talk about disappointed! I have been waiting for this to come out on DVD for a very long time since I originally saw this on TV in Hawaii back in the late 60's. I really wish this had been released in the original Japanese with subtitles but I guess it wasn't meant to be. I also spoke to the company that released this (Right Stuf) and according to them part 2 also will NOT have subtitles/closed captioning even though Amazon's listing for it states that it has. Hopes this helps those of us who NEED subtitles/cc.",1377993600,13,810,4.406666666666666

8575262,5,B00BY6XMDG,"It's a pleasure to see this lost show that is just now officially out. To think its been 30 years since it was last broadcasted in the US. Well on the review side of the topic, I would say the restoration looks decent, and the story is just as good as any old Disney film, as influential as that franchise is to this day and age. I can't say how much the dub differs from the original Japanese audio, but I enjoy the silly voices and overall girlie vibe that this show gives off.",1374019200,4,479,4.1063829787234045
