7331757,2,B011A8X3R2,"This isn't a movie, it's a collection of unrelated short stories. None of the stories are very interesting or scary.",1446336000,,116,4.85
7331758,2,B011A8X3R2,"The Invoking 2 doesn't have anything to do with the equally boring The Invoking (2013). That was about a house with some dark family secrets. This one takes the anthology format, does nothing at all with it and adds some dull ""paranormal events"" and only in about an hour's time. It is the type of rubbish you'd find in a college film class without any art leanings. The acting is non-existent and so is the story-line.  Cheap special effects don't help much either.

""U-Turn"" - A man picks up a silent hitchhiker and finds another accident on the road.

""Insane"" - A filmmaker with his guide in an abandoned asylum are haunted.

""Alone""  - A druggie woman at home is bothered by the image of her double.

""Do Not Disturb"" - A serial killer in a hotel room gets weird cards from a ghost.

""Natal"" - A crazy woman at a cabin is driven nuts by the sound of scratching.

 ""Melissa"" - A girl dials 911 to tell them about  a masked man near her home.

You'd probably have more fun watching the old 1970's horror anthologies like The House That Dripped Blood (1971), Tales from the Crypt (1972), Asylum (1972), From Beyond the Grave (1974), The Vault of Horror (1973), and Trilogy of Terror (1975).

Barely recommended other horror anthology films:

Southbound (2015)

Mxico Brbaro (2014)

V/H/S (2012)

Tales of Halloween (2015)

All Hallows' Eve 2 (2015)

A Christmas Horror Story (2015)",1444262400,5,1383,4.621399176954733

8723963,2,B011A8X3R2,"I did not know that this was an anthology.  It is just a bunch of short stories that are pretty dull.  The acting isn't that bad but it is not the greatest either.  I thought this would be more like the first one, but it has nothing to do with the first.  The paranormal stuff in the movie can barely even be called that, weird, yes, but by no means scary.

I just had noticed this movie in my queue and that I had not finished watching it and the rental was going to expire soon.  This movie was soo bad I forgot what it was about and why I didn't finish it in the first place.  I finished it this time but I was also half asleep, it  is the only way I could ever have gotten through this movie.  Spare yourself and your money and skip this one..",1446422400,2,747,3.9266666666666667
