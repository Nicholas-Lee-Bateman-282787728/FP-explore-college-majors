7847965,3,6303434053,"The escenography overwrought and distracting. The choreography pretty terrible, especially the group dances. Coppelia an Coppelius  disgusting. BUT Irina Schapchits is one of the most beautiful and talented dancers I have ever seen. She is the whole show. So she ended up marrying Mikhail Zvialov. What has become of her?",1125100800,,321,5.42
7847966,1,6303434053,This is not a production of the Petipa version of COPPELIA or even that by St.-Leon.  It's not even a truly classical ballet.  The score and libretto are tampered with almost beyond recognition and what little classical choreography there is borders on the grotesquely surreal.  The dancers seem fine but there is not much they can do with the material given.  I have not seen the Australian Ballet videotape (I cannot imagine that the dancers are as strong as they are at the Kirov) but this version is based upon the Cechetti staging of Petipa's production and said to be quite good.  It could not possibly be any worse than this.,1024963200,5,632,4.657657657657658
7847967,4,6303434053,"First of all, it must be said that this version of Copplia is beautifully and expertly danced. The orchestra is technically excellent even if its performance is not particularly inspired, and the camera work is generally very satisfying.
 However, changes have been made to the Delibes score which I, personally, find disturbing. They obviously were made to serve the choreographer's vision - which seems to have had a higher priority than did musical integrity - and they result in what may be a disappointing listening experience for those familiar with the original score. There is added music which fits stylistically with the rest, and is probably from Delibes, but it is certainly not the composer's best work. Even when the original music is used in this production, the tempi are often painfully slow, and some of the more appealing themes have been omitted. Furthermore, there are some poorly conceived gratuitous repetitions which tend, unfairly, to make the score sound trite.
 These drawbacks might not be bothersome to a viewer who is not comparing this tape with other versions of Copplia or who is not particularly attached to the original score.
 It should also be mentioned that this performance was taped without spectators, so the applause and encouragement of an audience is missing. This may be a contributing factor to what I view as a certain lack of enthusiasm on the part of the dancers.
 My personal opinion is that the videotape production of Copplia by the Australian Ballet, which places much more emphasis on story line and humor - and which utilizes the score intact - is the more satisfying of the two.",1015632000,11,1634,4.9743589743589745
