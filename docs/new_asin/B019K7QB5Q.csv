8745428,5,B019K7QB5Q,Patsy Ferran is an amazing Portia. Refreshingly smart. I can't see the role played any other way!  The whole production is supported by talented RSC actors.  This is one DVD you don't want to pass up.,1498262400,,200,4.527777777777778
8745429,4,B019K7QB5Q,"Uneven but increasingly fascinating, Polly Findlay's modern-dress ""Merchant of Venice"" for the Royal Shakespeare Company is capably acted, though it has nothing new to say about Shylock---and the faceless metallic decor on view could be used for just about any Shakespeare comedy.

Where her production comes alive is in its bitter feminist take on the intertwined love stories. To Findlay,choosing a husband is fraught with peril, and the accusations of betrayal over the ""lost"" wedding rings at the end of the play prove almost as momentous as the freakout over the lost handkerchief in ""Othello."" Even Shylock's daughter makes a bad match here.

Some of the sense of women trapped in unfortunate relationships involves playing against the text, and Findlay cuts the revelation of Portia's racism to make her a squeaky-clean heroine shocked at seeing her new husband kissing another man. She also cuts Antonio's final reversal of fortune---odd in a play structured on his financial circumstances.

t takes a while for the production to hit its stride, but just wait. The quality of mercy may not be strained but the quality of marriage definitely is here. That's definitely news on the Rialto.",1474848000,3,1195,5.181347150259067
8745430,2,B019K7QB5Q,"Every Shakespeares play contains a set of ordinary events that are intertwined with a more subtle and seemingly irrational layer. The challenge for every theatre director is not to erase this subtle layer. It is always this inner layer that drives the plot of the plays. Such a driving force behind the events presented in The Merchant of Venice is what Shakespeare refers to as the music of the spheres and the most heavenly music. It is this music that drives the entire plot of the play. But, this is not an ordinary music; this is a music that may not be heard. Or as explained by perceptive Lorenzo:
Such harmony is in immortal souls;
But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.
In other words, those whose souls are still maculated by worldly desires - cannot respond to it correctly. This is why Jessica is never merry when she hears this sweet music. There is another detail that may help to grasp the meaning of the play. Namely, The Merchant of Venice is a sequel to Othello. At the time of Othello, this music was absent from Venice. According to Shakespeares narrative, this most heavenly music was made available in Venice only after Othellos and Desdemonas arrival in Mauritania.
The music of the spheres may be compared to an invisible magnetic-like force that has just been switched on. Its effect on the various characters of the play varies in accordance with their inner sensitivities. In the opening scene of The Merchant of Venice, the presence of this music is indicated by its effect on Antonio. It is this music that induces Antonios melancholy. Antonio, like Jessica, cannot be merry when exposed to such sweet music. In this way, Shakespeare informs the audience about the state of Antonios soul. This music also affects other characters that appear in the play. Bassanio is suddenly prompted to travel to Belmont; Gratiano begs Bassanio to be allowed to travel with him; Jessica decides to escape from her fathers house and marry Lorenzo; Launcelot decides to run away from Shylock. Noticeably, Shylock, who follows strictly his rigid rules, is completely insensitive to the music of the spheres. His actions are driven by ordinary emotional and intellectual responses.
The source of the music is Belmont. The music has been activated just before the opening scene. Portia, this mortal-breathing saint, is capable of using this music for her purpose (sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages). It is quite obvious that she knows that Bassanio is still too immature and too irresponsible to be the right partner for her. Bassanio, however, has an inner quality that qualifies him for Portias schooling. Portias purpose, therefore, is to expose Bassanio to a series of experiences which, hopefully, will allow him to learn a few lessons. During the casket trial, Portia uses music to help Bassanio get in touch with his inner feelings, because only through them will he be able to recognize the right casket. After the casket trial, she sets him on another test: the ring test. And she knows that Bassanio will not be able to pass it. At the end of the play, the audience finds out that the entire episode with Antonios lost and then recovered ships was also arranged by Portia. Obviously, Bassanio has learnt very little from Portias teaching. This is why, before he is ready for his lady, he will have to go through some more painful experiences. These future experiences are presented in the next episodes of Shakespeares narrative, i.e., in The Taming of the Shrew and Romeo and Juliet.
Now, lets take a look at how Polly Findlay, the director of this RSC production, has interpreted the play. By playing up Antonios homosexuality, the director has made it very difficult for the audience to recognize the prime source of Antonios melancholy. Furthermore, cutting Portias lines, in which she informs Antonio about the sudden recovery of his ships, has drastically corrupted the subtle layer of the play. We are left only with is a sterilized version of the original plot. (It seems that Polly Findlay was influenced by Michael Radfords movie with Al Pacino as Shylock, for similar modifications to the original texts were made in that 2004 production.) Thats too bad, because the choir and the stage design used in this production could be so much better employed to denote the inner layer of the play. The choir appearing at the top of the stage could very well signify the music of the spheres. What was needed was to synchronize the appearances of the choir with the events that were induced by the music of the spheres, i.e., Jessica leaving her fathers house; Gratiano asking Bassanio to accompany him to Belmont; Bassanio meditation on the caskets. (Having Patsy Ferran, who plays Portia, mockingly singing during the casket trial is quite painful to watch; this ill-perceived invention has ruined the inner meaning of the entire scene). The swinging pendulum, like a clicking clock, could serve as a reminder that there is a time limit within which Portias task has to be accomplished. What was needed was to mark this window of opportunity by having the swinging pendulum right in the opening scene together with the appearance of the choir, i.e., prior to Antonios first appearance. The pendulum was to be stopped by Portia in the final scene, i.e., at the time when she informs Antonio about the recovery of his ships.
I was quite surprised to find out from the directors commentary that the idea of having the choir has nothing to do with the heavenly music. Apparently it was added to emphasize the presence of ... a religious (catholic) structure in Venice (?) The swinging pendulum, on the other hand, was to signify ... an ambiguity of the play, i.e., its shifting between comedy and tragedy (??) I have found it quite interesting that the music of the spheres, which is contained in Shakespeares plays, somehow is able to bypass the directors intellectual barriers (this muddy vesture of decay) and leave, in whatever form, its unique marks. Just like the choir and the pendulum in this production. In other words, despite the directors insensitivity to the inner content of the play, the music of the spheres could not be removed from this RSCs production.
Now, I am looking forward to the release of the disc of the RSCs production of Othello. I am expecting similar surprises, for Othello is one of the most challenging of Shakespeares plays.",1472688000,8,6452,4.871701546860782
