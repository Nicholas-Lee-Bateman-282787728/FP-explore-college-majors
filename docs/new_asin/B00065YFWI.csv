8039098,5,B00065YFWI,Best dvd on tennis instruction I have seen. Am amazed no one else has reviewed it. I have learnt so much and will need to continue watching it to absorb all the information. Good quality and good footage of the pro's demonstrating the techniques. My only gripe is that the modern serve dvd has not yet been made!,1126828800,3,312,4.396551724137931
