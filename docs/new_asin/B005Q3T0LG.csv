4857885,5,B005Q3T0LG,Have always liked this movie and enjoy having my own DVD.  The premise is clever.  A mother going to college to obtain a scholarship to help her daughter pay for her schooling.  Loretta Young is charming as always.,1361145600,3,214,4.578947368421052

4857887,5,B005Q3T0LG,"I too have been searching for this classic movie with Loretta Young.  Today I saw 2 different sources on the internet saying this will be released by Fox Cinema Archives around the end of October or late fall along with Come to the Stable, Take Her She's Mine (Sandra Dee), The Second Time Around (Debbie Reynolds) and Golden Girl (Mitzi Gaynor) among others.  I have been waiting for Take Her, She's Mine forever so I was pretty excited about that too.",1349654400,8,453,4.580246913580247
4857888,5,B005Q3T0LG,"I've been searching for Mother is a Freshman on DVD for 4 years and will continue until I find it.
I grew up watching it from a home recorded VHS. That copy is lost now. I would like to return Mother is a Freshman to my collection in the form of a DVD.
This movie is an old favorite of my family.
Highly recommended.",1325116800,14,316,3.953125
4857889,5,B005Q3T0LG,"It's 1949 and Loretta Young has to be the most beautiful woman on the planet.  She's also gentle-spoken, lovable, sweet and very stylish.  Van Johnson plays a handsome professor at Pointer College.  The problem is Betty Lynn, who plays Loretta's rather spoiled daughter.  She's developed a crush on Van, who is old enough to be her father.  This leads to complications when Loretta goes back to college to get her hands on some scholarship funding because she and Betty are overdrawn at the bank.

Van falls in love with Loretta, not Betty.  Barbara Lawrence is another student with a crush on Van.  He's a very popular professor.  Barbara even flunked his course so she could repeat it.  Meanwhile, Robert Arthur, a handsome young man of the right age, is in love with Betty who treats him badly because she's in love with Van.  And Rudy Vallee is the family lawyer who is in love with Loretta.  Everyone is hopelessly in love with the wrong people!

Throughout this romantic tangle, we have the gals all dressed in the latest styles of 1949.  White gloves, hats, gowns, slacks, hair and jewels -- they all look sensational by any standard.  Especially Loretta, who later became known as a fashion plate with her TV show in the 1950s.  In one scene, though, the designer had to be drunk.  Loretta shows up in a gown that looks like it was stitched together from table cloths, but she's gorgeous even in that.

This amusing movie has beautiful people, colorful sets, funny twists in the plot, and will put you in a good mood.  You'll spot people in bit parts who later became bigger stars in the 50s, including Jeff Richards, Debra Paget and Kathleen Hughes.",1319241600,31,1658,4.674740484429066

4857922,4,B005Q3T0LG,"Amusing late 40's comedy with the beautiful Loretta Young.  She plays the mother of a college-aged girl who has to return school herself in order to gain money from an inheritance.  There she meets and falls in love with the professor her daughter has a crush on.  The costumes, for the most part, are pretty and the color is lovely, almost pastel-like.  The 20th-Century Fox Cinema Archives DVD-R release is beautiful quality and worth getting.  Highly recommended.",1420502400,2,466,5.0

4857933,3,B005Q3T0LG,"I rated it only one star because of the quality of the DVD.  I do not know if it was the copy/master recording it was burned from or what.  The face tones were terrible!  The movie itself I loved that is why I was compelled to give it three stars, however if the quality had been better it would have been FIVE stars.  The price point was too pricey all things considered.",1372809600,5,372,4.125
4857934,5,B005Q3T0LG,"I hit the jackpot when I found Mother was a Freshman, but also Sitting Pretty and The Model and Marriage Broker. It was a triple play!! I think Loretta Young is just an exquisite beauty! Again the story line is a simple one. The movie is just fun to watch especially when in the beginning of the movie you see a very attractive Loretta Young in a matronly look then she goes back to school on a grant that her grandmother had set up years ago. This also allows her daughter to go back to the university. Going back to school Ms. Young seems to blossom into a more confident and easy going beauty. I had a mini marathon of old movies for an entire weekend. The running time of these movies is also a plus. Each of the movies runs about an hour and a half, not too long, not too short.
Again the story line is on the surface a simple one, but there are of course the human complications that add their own twist. I think many of these old movies illustrate life lessons such as just because you want something or someone it doesn't mean that it will work out, a person needs periodic reality checks and not live in a dream world, and telling a person the truth is hard because of the possibilities of hurt feelings. In the end honesty is the best policy.",1372118400,7,1252,4.220833333333333
4857935,3,B005Q3T0LG,"I bought the movie because I like the stars, but the story is not engaging. You can converse while watching.",1367452800,,108,4.45
4857936,5,B005Q3T0LG,"This was truly a delightful movie. If you like good, clean, fun movies, this is one you'll love. Van Johnson was funny and Loretta Young was extremely cute. If you like Thelma Lou from Andy Griffith your in for a treat because she's in this one and at her best. They don't make them like this anymore.",1364601600,3,301,4.298245614035087

4857938,5,B005Q3T0LG,A fun evening for classic movie buffs. Who could resist Loretta Young as the mother forced to go to college and then finding herself in competition with her daughter for professor Van Johnson. Throw Rudy Valee into the mix and you have a glowing tribute to yesteryear's golden era.,1361577600,7,281,4.755102040816326
