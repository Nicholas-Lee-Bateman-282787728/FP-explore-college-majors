2475188,5,B000DENUPU,"The Sioux Nation produced many great leaders such as Crazy Horse, Red Cloud, Sitting Bull, and Russell Means. American Indian actor and activist Russell Means is a powerhouse and what he has to say is very upsetting, (You'll never see this on network television) but this man is one of the most gifted speakers I have ever heard, and I recommend this film to everyone who has an interest in Native Americans and what they are going through. Congressman Jim McDermott, who gained fame and notoriety from appearing in Michael Moore's movie Fahrenheit 911, offers real insight into what life is like for many American Indians who live on the reservations where they are isolated and alienated. The film reminded me of Incident at Oglala with Robert Redford in its style and visual composition. If you want to understand what life is like on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, then you should definitely see this film.",1139961600,9,914,4.865384615384615
2475189,5,B000DENUPU,"This documentary makes a powerful statement about hope and will inspire anyone who has faced discrimination and despair. Indian activist and actor Russell Mean's statements about 911 and the Twin Towers are shocking and disturbing, but his belief in the culture of the Lakota (Sioux) is powerful and moving. The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation is like a third world country in many respects and watching this film gives you the sense of the desolation and isolation people living there must feel. It almost can be viewed as a mirror of what life could be like for many of us in the future as baby boomers age and the entitlement programs collapse. This film is a warning as a well as a statement of hope. What can we learn from the Sioux? I've been asking myself that question since I first watched this remarkable movie.",1139011200,9,819,4.694444444444445
2475190,5,B000DENUPU,"Wounded Heart:  This powerful film gives viewers the opportunity to see what life is really like for the poorest of Indian nations.  No shopping malls, no industry, no help and no hope.  Yet, there are those who feel the situation is not irreversible.  With understanding and compassion this documentary shows a proud nation of people who believe in the future, no matter how bleak.  This film will have you looking at it a second and third time to make sure you saw it right the first time.  Well worth the investment of your time and energy.",1138665600,9,543,4.604166666666667
8102678,2,B000DENUPU,"I ordered this for research.  It was not particularly helpful.  It did show some of both sides to challenges on the rez, but was over all not worth the time and money.  I am donating it to the library so the next person doesn't spend any $.",1357948800,,240,4.0638297872340425
8102679,3,B000DENUPU,"This work speaks about a lot of issues hurting the Lakota Nation.  Those who live nowhere near a reservation will be highly informed by the topics presented.  I applaud this effort.  However, the work was strikingly andrcentric.  The grand majority of interviewees were men.  Even when women spoke, they were only on screen a fraction of time compared to the men.  Author and activist Paula Gunn Allen once wrote that focusing on Native women, and not just Native men, opens doors to new possibilities.  Her ideas were not practiced here at all.  Near the end of the work, Means stated that the classical Lakota society was matriarchal.  Well, you wouldn't know that by what's presented here.  I think pro-feminist viewers may be disappointed in this one regard when watching this laudable work.",1254268800,,795,4.954545454545454
8102680,1,B000DENUPU,"I didn't really believe one reviewer who commented it was like watching talking heads.  Surely they exaggerated!  But, to my profound disappointment, it was true.  Very little in the way of illustrative footage, mostly cameras focused on people talking about issues.  Very disappointing, and the waste of an opportunity to illustrate life on Pine Ridge, and what happens when the good things of a culture are completely decimated, and replaced with garbage, all in the name of ""civilizing"" a people in our own image.",1216944000,4,516,5.107142857142857
8102681,2,B000DENUPU,"Strangely enough, ""Wounded Heart : Pine Ridge and the Sioux"" boils down to a series of lengthy commentaries, devoid of visual illustrations. To crown it all, the close-up shots of recurrent faces strained my eyes, causing me to squint.
Personally, I didn't learn anything new, I've been wise to the bare facts for years. As to those who had no idea of what these people have to cope with, the commentaries are informative basically, still, a documentary is supposed to provide more than the mere expression of anger. Here, it proves to be a wild-goose chase.
While I expected to get a thorough picture of Pine Ridge, that is for example of people in their daily lives or public activities, focusing on the way the communities are organized, I'm left wondering whether there are any food-stores on the reservation, or anything like a post-office or a bank with an automat! Just because the place is depicted as some kind of a no man's land in which blackmold virtually outnumbers the inhabitants!
One positive aspect though, if any, supposing the documentary was meant to make us take the full measure of the locals' frustration, well, very good job indeed! Hopefully, I'm currently planning to travel all the way from France to South Dakota next summer.",1216080000,,1253,4.859813084112149
8102682,5,B000DENUPU,"This DVD is highly educational and sadly informative.  To think that this is happening on U.S. soil is astounding.  This deals with interviews and educating the viewer, not entertaining the viewer.  If the images on the screen don't change fast enough for you then you might be interested in some Dora DVD's.",1210291200,2,308,4.884615384615385
8102683,4,B000DENUPU,"Finally!  A non-Hollywoodized documentary showing real footage & opinions about how the Indians have been overly mistreated by our government.  Empty promises, raping of their lands, unlivable conditions, etc.  Will our government EVER follow through on promises made even if there aren't any monetary benefits?!  Anyone who wants to see the TRUTH of how Indians have been mistreated must see this!!  A big thank you to Mr. Tuthill for a non-sugar coated version of such an important issue.",1197763200,2,490,5.230769230769231
8102684,3,B000DENUPU,"After all the great reviews, I bought this film to show to a class. I never will. This movie is talking heads. Yes, the heads are interesting, but unlike other reviewers, I strongly feel that it does not engage the emotions - there are way way way too many close head shots and not enough SHOWING of the problems. The only ones who moved me was the young woman and the man who had found his roots - he could have been used as the counterpoint/antidote to visuals of some of the problems.

And it was repetitive. No, there's gotta be a better way to get the point across than just talking about it. My class can get this information in half an hour on the internet. If you want people to engage in your cause, you have to engage them on an emotional level.

Even the discussion of the lovely parts of the Lakota culture don't have any visuals, which to me was the most frustrating thing of all. You talk about a pow wow, why not SHOW a pow wow? You talk about the tiospaye, why not SHOW an extended family? You talk about the grandmothers, SHOW them! You talk about mashing the choke cherries, SHOW it!

If you want to engage people emotionally, they need visuals. Show the poverty more. SHOW the people Russell Means is talking about picking through the garbage dump. SHOW kids cutting school! SHOW people getting drunk! Also, the housing issues were discussed purely in terms of the mold issue, when there are people surviving winters of 30 below zero in shacks. SHOW them to me so I can try to imagine what it must feel like. I was totally frustrated by the end of the movie.

I am very sad to give this review because I think we really need more educational information on the current situation of all Native Americans since the general public is next to completely ignorant about the poverty that ravishes most reservations. I had a feeling while watching the movie that part of the reason we don't get the show is to avoid the embarrassment. Isn't living in this poverty daily an embarrassment? Isn't the fact that we even allow this poverty to exist in this country an embarrassment? A sensitive film maker can engage your emotions visually without sacrificing people's dignity.

If you want general information on problems on the reservation, this is fine. If you want compelling visuals, you will not find them here. For me, this was a dud.",1189209600,24,2348,4.515294117647059
8102685,4,B000DENUPU,It's one of the most touching films i have seen. It deals with alot of issues not made public.,1179705600,,94,4.0
8102686,5,B000DENUPU,"This is a truly memorable and moving documentary on the social and political problems of Lakota life on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservervation in South Dakota.  So many people do not know or understand their way of life.  Director Oliver Tuthill shows an un-yielding glance into the Lakota's everyday problems and perseverance in order to survive.  He shows the issues factually (such as the mold overtaking their homes, the poverty, and abuse)and lets the viewer see the horrors for themselves.  The film is highlighted by insightful interviews by the Lakotas and government officials.  After seeing this documentary, one wants to be an activist and try to help make a difference in the hard lives of these remarkable people.  This film not only shows the grittiness of their life, but the contrasting richness of their culture, customs, and their will to survive.  I would  recommend this documentary to anyone who wants to know more about the Lakota way of life as well as be inspired.",1153353600,21,986,4.969512195121951
8102687,5,B000DENUPU,"A very careful and full view of sociological, economic and political problems on a Native American reservation with interesting interviews with Indian leaders and business people. Should see this good, well made 70 minute film dealing with a serious American problem. Living conditions on the reservation are shown as are resultant health problems.

A must see!
