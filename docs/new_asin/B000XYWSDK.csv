8414541,3,B000XYWSDK,"This disc was available at cash registers at F.Y.E. awhile back only to promote anchor bay's dvds.

The disc itself is 30 minutes long. It has a trailer for Hatchet and clips from Hellraiser, the original Halloween, The Evil Dead, the original Children of the Corn, Phantasm, Re-Animator, Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon, Near Dark, and the original Hills Have Eyes.

First off, while some of the clips were good, they were ruined by poor editing. This is most prominent in the Hellraiser and Phantasm clips.

Secondly, from a pure business standpoint, Anchor Bay didn't take advantage of this Sampler. They could have also included clips of Hellbound: Hellraiser II, Evil Dead II, the original Dawn of the Dead, the original Day of the Dead, Day of the Dead 2: Contagium, Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers, Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers, Creepshow 2 and alot of other titles they have the rights to. They could have easily made this much longer and promoted a hell of alot more flicks.

And lastly, when you press menu, you come to a really ****ty looking screen. For such a big name company, they should have atleast added a respectable menu to this dvd and not something I could make in Windows DVD Maker.

While it is lackluster, the price on here is too good to pass up if you are a horror collector like myself.",1263686400,,1347,4.619246861924686
