7839640,2,6303127142,"If you were looking for the outstanding 1980 series ""Great Railway Journeys of the World"", please be aware that this is NOT that series.  I have been looking high and low for that series, especially for the episode ""The Long Straight"".  Which is about the longest straight railway line in the world i.e. the Australian line that goes across the Nullarbor plain.

Instead, we get a bland series that sounds like it was produced by a tourism company.",1513382400,,448,4.717948717948718

Good quality video.",1481673600,,140,4.64
7839642,5,6303127142,"I love this journey in India. It is very memorable. I have kept it in my closet as a DVD, but will soon get it digitized. It is a railway journey, not that there is any one place to go. Its the journey, and what is seen and felt along the way.",1461283200,,243,3.6923076923076925

7839644,2,6303127142,"I was disappointed- I was expecting something like Michael Portillo's videos, and this seemed more like an advertisement for the various ""palace Train"" commercial enterprises.  Much of the video is taken up with the furnishings and service on the trains.",1407542400,3,254,5.35
7839645,1,6303127142,"I found this DVD substandard, it's content somewhat confusing, was it  about the journey ?? it certainly lacked information, the editing was somewhat erratic. In one word amateurish",1392681600,2,181,5.464285714285714
7839646,1,6303127142,It is only one episode . A journey not journeys. I got it for a gift for someone who was dissapointed.,1323216000,,102,3.9047619047619047
7839647,5,6303127142,"I saw ""Confessions of a Train Spotter"" on PBS about 20-25 years ago, along with the other shows that made up the series called ""Great Railway Journeys of the World.""  ""Confessions of a Train Spotter"" is the only episode of the series that I have seen available for sale.  I bought a VHS tape of it in 1997 and haven't seen it in any store since then.  I recently found the book ""Great Railway Journeys of the World"", written by the hosts of the series' episodes.  These are essential programs and deserve to be re-introduced to a new audience.  A boxed set of all the episodes, especially on DVD, would be a treasure trove, indeed.  I'm sure they would bring back wonderful memories, especially for those fortunate enough to have experienced these train trips firsthand.",1112140800,12,770,4.666666666666667
