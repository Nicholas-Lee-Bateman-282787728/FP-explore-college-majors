8140745,3,B000HPNF5U,"Genuinely daffy low-budget horror anthology comprised of three stories.  The first entitled Young Blood feels a lot like one of the lighter segments from The Night Gallery--it involves two adoption agents who have an on site interview with a couple who want a child--and who are also clearly vampires with campy Bela Lugosi style accents.  The female agent is completely under the spell of the count and promises him a child with no red tape and little wait while her male partner tries to maintain some professional standards and determine whether the couple would be suitable parents to adopt while also clearly mindful of the fact that if he says the wrong thing he might not make it out of the house alive.  The segment is cute if generally more silly than inspired.

Segment two named The Guardians is much less successful although it does feature some reasonably impressive set design on a presumably very low budget.  The story involves a gravedigger who is forced to reveal the entrance of a walled up cavern that runs under the graveyard to two men he thought were his friends.  Their plan is to rob graves of jewelry from under the ground so no one will be aware that the graves were ever disturbed.  Needless to say things don't work out as planned.  The burnt out church ruins and underground cavern are surprisingly well realized for a segment that presumably didn't cost much to make--the most obvious problem with the segment besides the fact that it really never goes anywhere is the use of rats that appear to have come directly from a pet store--even if you are afraid of rats you won't be afraid of these rats--they are mostly white and appear to be quite friendly even when they are supposedly eating someone alive.

The final segment Visions of Sugarplums is the best of the three by an extremely wide margin but also doesn't feel much like it belongs in the same movie as the first two.  It's a broad comedy about two young siblings, a brother and sister, who are dropped off at granny's the week before Christmas so their parents can vacation in Hawaii and return on Christmas Eve.  Wheelchair bound granny is doting and full of love and kisses for her young grandchildren--until her meds run out.  Then she turns into bad granny--alarming the children with bizarre behavior that includes telling a hilariously nasty new version of The Night Before Christmas, rat poison laced cups of hot chocolate and, eventually, chasing them all over her house Elmer Fudd style with a shotgun.

This segment is excellent largely because of the child actors playing the young brother and sister who are in their own way actually pretty amazing--their performances are so unmannered and natural it's hard to tell how much is planned acting and how much might be the children's actual reactions to what the actress playing bad grannie is doing in the scenes.  Much of the humor revolves around the contrast between the aggressively insane antics of granny and the generally underplayed reactions of her surprisingly calm and reasonable grandchildren who keep trying to make the best of the situation.  The segment is quite funny although that isn't necessarily what a viewer might be looking for in the closing segment of a horror anthology.

The stories are introduced by a skeleton puppet in a coffin named Igor who looks a little like the Crypt Keeper from Tales From the Crypt (although this film was actually made 5 years before the HBO program first aired) and sounds very much like Night Gallery era Rod Sterling.  To make things even goofier further commentary is provided by talking turkey puppets--three modeled after the Three Stooges and two modeled after Laurel and Hardy.

I'm pretty sure I've seen just about every horror movie released in theaters since the early 1970's but I have no memory of this one ever playing which is a shame because it's definitely above average as low budget horror anthologies go and also features some cheesy throw-stuff-at-the-audience 3D effects that likely would have been fun if you actually had the opportunity to see Tales of the Third Dimension in a theater in 3D.

Producer Earl Owensby specialized in low-budget southern drive-in fare so it's possible Tales of the Third Dimension actually played somewhere.  In 1984 the same year Tales of the Third Dimension was released Earl Owensby also produced Hyperspace (aka Gremloids), a very silly low-budget Star Wars parody starring completely unknown actors named Paula Poundstone and Chris Elliott--both making their acting debuts.  Despite its obvious cult value I'm pretty sure Hyperspace has never been released in the United States although at one time it was available on home video in the UK and Scandinavia.  A friend's father-in-law had seen Gremloids when he was a teacher living in the United Arab Emirates and begged me to track down a copy for him--which I did.  Also in 1984 Earl Owensby produced another 3D horror film called Dogs of Hell about a pack of deadly Rottweilers that, unfortunately, did actually make it to a theater near me.  My only memory of it besides the fact that it was god-awful was that I was the only person in the theater, sitting there completely alone with my 3D glasses on which was kind of embarrassing.  It's too bad Tales of the Third Dimension wasn't picked up for wider distribution instead because it's a pretty fun movie which is worth watching for the third segment alone.",1425340800,3,5428,4.86117136659436
8140746,5,B000HPNF5U,This is a hard to find movie. I loved it though. I was funny and the host segments were campy and entertaining. The last story of the evil grandma is the best one and will have you in stitches!,1407542400,3,193,3.9743589743589745
