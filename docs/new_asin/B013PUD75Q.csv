The talented and Hollywood handsome Christopher Barbour - among other things  encourages the trust of intuition. He reveals his own story and shares his insightful process. Its exhilarating to watch Christopher and Pam Coronado work together to teach the rest of us, in a simple and organized way, the protocol for drawing subjects. Christopher has a way of bringing clarity to chaos and he reminds us that life is always so certain and perhaps the best thing one  anyone can do is to listen more carefully to our intuition speaking from places beyond time and matter, places buried in the middle of the earth and in the untouchable part of the soul. My only wish is that Christopher had his own TV show so I could continue to learn from him. I am not a remote viewer and the beauty of this DVD is you don't have to be either in order to appreciate the wisdom. Bravo!",1468108800,,946,4.494186046511628
