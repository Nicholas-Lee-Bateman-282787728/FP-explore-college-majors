This video has a great method of allowing you to pick the distance you wish to walk. With warm up and cool down built into any length of workout! Great, easy choreography and motivation!",1253145600,,297,4.518518518518518
3851467,4,B00265T7O2,This collection has two of the workout's I purchased in the past. The 4 mile express is part of this and so is the 2 mile with the strechy band.  I'm glad to get the two mile back sense I had it on tape and the VCR ate my copy. It's a good workout. I even like the 1 mile get up and go. I've tried all the routines on this CD and there is one that will fit in your schedule.  I'm actually going to use it today. This is also a great substitue for when I can't get to the gym and I need a good workout.,1253059200,3,501,3.5871559633027523
3851468,5,B00265T7O2,"I have just gotten this, therefore, I am still doing the one mile walk.  I really like it and it is not hard to do.  No coordination required, which is a good thing :)  I look forward to working my way up to the other levels of walking.  I do intend to buy some weight balls and the stretchie band is included with the DVD's.  Thanks!",1252713600,,334,4.0
3851469,4,B00265T7O2,"If you purchased "" Walk Away the Pounds, Express"" it's just been repackaged onto one disk instead of four. It's a great workout with the stretchy band, I just wish they would of put something on the packaging that this was just re-packaged and saved me some money. Oh well, I will find someone who will use my old set. I like that all the workouts are on one disk instead of three.",1252108800,9,381,4.232876712328767
3851470,4,B00265T7O2,I like the variety however I just wish the resistance bands were used more in the 2 mile.  Other than that I love the DVD and the resistance band really pumps up the workout!,1251936000,2,174,4.117647058823529
3851471,3,B00265T7O2,"Don't buy this dvd if you already have the 1 mile,2 mile 3 mile and 4 mile dvds as this is just putting them all onto one dvd which is rather dissappointing. They are good workouts but if like me you already have them then it is a waste of money",1251676800,21,245,3.823529411764706
3851472,5,B00265T7O2,"A great workout dvd, this Leslie Sansone walking workout once again delivers.
With Leslie is her group of walkers who range in age from 20 to 70 years. Each workout uses the strechie band which is included with the dvd,except the 4 mile super challenge.
The dvd includes;
1 mile get up & get started- 18 minutes
2 mile brisk walk- 30 minutes
3 mile advanced walk- 51 minutes
4 mle super challenge- 60 minutes.
While doing the 2 mile brisk walk,I wore a heart monitor and burned 179 calories,and the 4 mile super challenge,I burned 447 calories.",1251676800,204,544,4.561224489795919
3851473,5,B00265T7O2,"Three of these workouts (the 2, 3, and 4 miles) are from Leslie's WATP Express 2 DVD set of 2003.  My sister introduced me to these workouts this summer so when I received mine I recognized it as the same one.  This is fine with me as I have only one other of her DVDs.
The set is attractive and  her regular troupe of walkers are there with her.  The one mile workout introduces new walkers and incorporates one pound weighted balls.  A stretchie band is included and is used in the two and three mile routines.  The four mile is fast paced but not jogging or boosted walking.  These are all fun and energetic workouts and motivate you to come back again and again.  I worked up a sweat on each workout.  The four mile is a challenge, but in a good way.",1250985600,6,754,4.180555555555555
3851474,5,B00265T7O2,"First, I just have to say that Leslie Sansone has changed my life.  I have lost more than thirty pounds since starting her workout DVD's in February, 2009, six months ago.

Her newest DVD, Walk Away the Pounds Ultimate Collection, is fantastic!  As soon as I got it, I couldn't wait to ""get off the couch"" and dig in.

The music is good, she doesn't over-talk with her fellow walkers (which can get annoying on some of her DVD's).  The cues are right-on, the pace quick, and the moves enjoyable and not confusing.  I just love the 3 miles and the 4 mile walks on this DVD - the three mile also incorporates the use of the band (included) while you continue to walk - the four mile does not use the band, but you get so much of a workout that you don't need it.  The moves are basic - not boosted - and not confusing.  You power walk, do knee lifts, kicks, side steps (single and double and some doubles with kick-backs or taps) and kickbacks (and some double kickbacks, which I had never seen before, but, which are pretty easy to do).

Thank you Leslie!",1248912000,339,1054,4.282828282828283
3851475,5,B00265T7O2,"This was actually the second time I purchased this same video series. The first one, I wore it out I guess. I've always loved Leslie Sansone, but this is my favorite video collection of hers. I like that by having 4 different choices, you can customize your workout based on the time you have available, your fitness level, and whether you choose to use the stretchy band or not for a more intense workout. And she's so motivating, that now my husband and kids join in the walks. It's a win-win! I definitely recommend this! And if by chance, I wear this one out too, I'll be purchasing another copy in the future.",1518739200,2,614,4.442477876106195

3851502,4,B00265T7O2,"Years ago I had several of Leslie's WATP VHS tapes and used to do the 1 and 2 mile a lot.  Over the years I stopped and got totally out of shape.  Recently I wanted to start back up and was happy to discover that on this DVD the original WATP, 1 Mile walk is included (the one with the blue weighted balls of which I still have 2 sets).  For the last couple months I have been doing it again and loving it!  My now 50+ year old body is starting to feel better, my knees don't ""twinge"" when walking up and down stairs anymore and I am so happy to have found this again.  So for any of you out there that loved the original series back 16 years ago and your old VHS tape is broken you'll be happy to know the same workout is on this (with all the familiar participants).  I recently started to try part of the 2 mile Brisk Walk and I like it so far.  I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars because the ""music"" that is used in the 2 mile is sort of annoying (""walk power walk....walk power walk"")  I wish it were just some peppy beats and leave out the dudes chanting.  But for those of you out there (and I know that you're out there) who were Leslie fans back when you were in your 30s pick this up and get going on it again.",1493596800,2,1221,3.8714859437751006

3851511,5,B00265T7O2,A friend had loaned me several of Leslie's older dvd's and I liked them for filling in between aerobic classes.  I researched several single dvd's and decided to go for this one based on other reviews and the fact that it said it contained 4 separate exercises.  I've already done the 3 mile and 4 mile sets and am very pleased with them.  Each really is a separate exercise versus some of the other dvd's that simply add on.  I am 68 and in pretty good shape and feel that I am getting a good workout. This one is a keeper.  A good value - Thanks!,1485648000,,548,4.132075471698113

3851513,5,B00265T7O2,"I started out with zumba and some of the steps for me were difficult to follow or keep up as I can't dance - 2 left feet. My co-worker told me about  Walk away the pounds which I tried several of her videos on you tube and loved. So I ordered this and also rec'd the tone every zone and belly blasting walk - which I haven't tried these yet as I am up to the 4 mile super challenge and once I get thru this I will move on to the next dvd. Since Sept 17, 2016 I am down 60 pounds with a few more to go.  When you hear walk away the pounds - it's more than walking - knee lifts, kicks, arm movements, and more - she keeps you motivated and if you can't keep up she says go back to walking. Plus doing it in my home is great! I recommend her videos! And a big thanks to my co-worker!

3851527,1,B00265T7O2,"There are a lot of issues with this video.  The first is the simple stuff:  You cannot hear the beat of the music when Sansone is talking which is most of the time.  The music is too low in volume.  And the beat of the music is used to set the pace and to determine if you are actually getting the number of miles specified in the walk.  Then there is the chronic issue of Sansone gets to chatting and misses her own countdowns and instructions.  I am woefully out of shape so when the instruction is given to go to sidesteps in 8 counts and she doesn't, you tend to jerk yourself back into what she was doing.  That creates stress on joints.  But perhaps the one thing that is of greatest concern is the lack of pace to create an aerobic state.  I weigh over 300 lbs and am over 65.  My ""aerobic zone""  needed for cardio vascular health is relatively low but for a large portion of the 2 mile walk my heart rate was not high enough to get to my aerobic range.  In fact, when I repeated the video only about a fourth of the time was fast paced enough to get to that heart rate.  The resistance bands slow everything to  a pace that becomes less beneficial.  Since ""heart health"" is the primary focus of these walking videos, this would appear to be a significant fail--when it doesn't achieve it primary fitness goal.  And if they can't get the heart rate of a 300+ lb woman high enough I don't think this would work very well for those who are in better shape.",1473984000,3,1461,4.182795698924731

I broke a sweat (probably because of the weight). Once I lost about 40LBS and started building up stamina I didn't need it anymore. I recommended to my mom who is older and just a bit over weight. She likes it. I can say that after hearing it the first few times I turned it down and listened to my own playlist. The talking is pretty annoying after a while. The faces some of the people make are hilarious and one girl seems like she has a wedgie or something because she's always kicking her leg when no one else is.

3851556,5,B00265T7O2,I really enjoy this walking program. There are four programs that take you from a one mile up to a four mile walk. It's perfect for those days when it cold or raining outside plus this gives you a more full body workout that you don't get from just walking.,1459296000,,257,4.16

3851561,5,B00265T7O2,Leslie Sansone's walk away the pounds is a great motivating exercise DVD. I have so much energy when I get finished walking with Leslie and her crew. I would recommend this to any working mom who can't find the extra time to ride to the gym while having to care for the family. In your own home you can be free without all the noise of a public gym.,1458345600,,349,4.072463768115942

This fits the bill perfect as it pushes you, but the impact is low.  I love the side to side movement as it stretches your hip flexor muscles and takes any atrophy that I had from not moving out.  You have to work, but what you put in is what you get out.  I have done the 2, 3 and 4 mile walks and they never disappoint to get a good sweat up!",1458259200,6,489,3.85

I can do as many miles as I choose and Leslie is so encouraging! The workouts are low impact (great for someone who is overweight) but challenging enough to know you got a good workout. I did the 4 mile today since it was my day off and it was tough! I wanted to stop when I hit the 3 mile mark but kept going. I was dripping with sweat when I was done but felt so good and burned over 500 calories!,1457308800,2,522,3.7981651376146788

3851578,5,B00265T7O2,I work out every day with friends and have many different DVDs.  We are between 60 and 70 yrs. old but are in pretty good shape.  This is our favorite walking DVD.  We get almost 5000 steps in when we do the 3 miles and are really sweating by the end of the tape.  You really feel good when it is done.  We are all working toward completing the four-mile walk.

In fact I own several of my dvds, and like to switch up my workout. I also love that Leslie is a real person, with a warm personality, and great motivator.  With her workout the beats of the music is how you keep your pace.  I love that at the bottom of the screen it shows when you have reached the 1, 2 or 3 mile mark.  There is also a walk clock to count down the minutes, which helps to keep you going.  My daughter who is 11, loves to work out with me.  It has helped me be a good role model to her.  I also appreciate the face that her workouts do not take a lot of room, since we have a small apartment with very limited space.",1454630400,4,808,3.860606060606061

She is an enthusiastic instructor, and the program is so easy to follow. The stretchie band included is a great plus. I find the 2-mile walk challenging but feel wonderful afterwards. I'm hoping to continue up to the rest of her DVD's that feature longer walks and different muscle-toning exercises that include the stretchie band and other equipment. This is a great tape to start with because it also includes a shorter one-mile walk.",1454371200,,605,4.771428571428571

I've been using several Sansone videos for 5 months now, and the 3 and 4 mile walks still put me in the desired heart rate for calorie burn. Unlike many of her videos, this one has 4 complete walks on it as opposed to 4 miles broken into 4 one mile segments, which means you just keep moving with no interruptions.

I don't work up a sweat in the 1 mile video, but my heartrate really gets up, especially with the weighted part. I use 3 lb weights for that and it seems to really make me work. I have done the 2 mile, which was great too, but I had to take a nap after because it was just too long for me. The 1 mile 1-2 times a day is much more attainable for me. The walking gets a little boring over time, but if you are in need of moving and getting stronger (I can't tell if it makes me lose weight, I'm pregnant, right now I just care about strength), then this is for you.",1451779200,,635,3.8923076923076922

Granted I have only done Mile 1 and 2 and that's mainly because, I switched over to a more modern CD that is more energetic with better music.  I like the routines, thus far.  Mile 1 uses weights, and I really, and I mean really need upper body conditioning.  Mile 2 has a knee lift march that I like but the energy is not there .  I know that if this were the only CD that I had of her's, I'd get bored and quit working out and would not purchase another CD from her.  Thank goodness, I know better.

I do wish more of these were available on instant video because sometimes my DVD player won't read the disc.  It's always my favorites this happens to.

My body is showing improvement and I have moved my belt buckle over a notch.

She has a few other DVD's that I am going to buy. I now officially Love Leslie!",1445212800,,419,3.9761904761904763
3851642,5,B00265T7O2,I really like this DVD!  It is great for starting out your day to add a exercise at the beginning of the day or add an extra workout later in the day after your regular workout.

3851673,4,B00265T7O2,"I think this is an excellent walking DVD for beginner to intermediate exercisers, or those with injuries or other issues that might lead to the desire for a light, low impact workout.  The production is good, cueing excellent, and there's a huge variety of what I call the ""backup dancers"" - from young to old, thin to not thin.  I've never tried a Leslie Sansone video before, and I found her to be a perfectly fine and motivating instructor.

That being said, I had to give this one away, because it was just too slow for me.  The DVD consists of 4 workouts, beginning with the 18-minute ""Get Up And Get Started"" all the way up to the 60-minute ""Super Challenge."" (in between are the 30-minute ""Brisk Walk"" and the 51-minute ""Advanced Walk.""). A resistance band is included with the DVD, and is incorporated in some of the workouts.  And I'm not saying the ""Advanced Walk"" was easy, I mean, 60 minutes of anything can get a little tough.  But I felt like a could have got more done in a shorter amount of time had I been doing something else.  As I said, it just felt slow.  And I'm still giving it 4 stars because this is exactly what some people need - for its purpose, it's great.  Just not for me.",1439424000,,1203,4.358744394618834

3851696,2,B00265T7O2,This compilation is so old.  At least 12 years old.  It doesn't fit widescreen TVs/monitors.  The picture stays square.  I didn't like how the people on the far right and left of Leslie are cut off most of the time from the screen.  Why did the cameraman do that?  Both the 3 and 4 mile are like that.  The 4 mile is sepia tone.  Everyone is wearing black.  Baggy black sweatpants.  Black tanks.  It's depressing. Not inspiring at all! I won't be using this DVD again.

It includes separate but similar workouts ranging from 18 to 60 minutes, so you can choose the one that matches your time and endurance. The 2- and 3-mile walks include using a stretch band. You can do any of these with hand weights to bump up the difficulty.

Leslie Sansone cracks me up with her positive attitude and high-force laughter. Her voice is, well, annoying ... but endearing. These workouts are simple and unchallenging; I think most people of most ages could do them. But that doesn't mean they aren't effective. You can get a lot of moving done by following along with Leslie, without very difficult moves like deep squat holds and pushups.

My only criticism is that the DVDs aren't HD, the picture quality is a bit blurry. But it really doesn't matter.",1434585600,,856,4.7

3851714,2,B00265T7O2,"I long ago purchased one of Leslie Sansone's workout videos and did drop a few pounds.  However, her constant chatter (and lack of being able to focus on the workout while doing this chattering) drove me batty.  I decided to purchase other walk fit DVDs by Leslie to see if possibly there was one that she actually doesn't talk through, but I was unsuccessful in my search.  When she does this ongoing talking, she is unable to move from one move to the next and tends to forget where she was or was going in the workout.  Through my search for a more focused and structured workout similar to her routines (as they are not terribly difficult and some do give a good cardio sweat), I have found that Denise Austin has similar steps without the uncoordinated plot.  Although Denise does talk throughout her routines, too, she is able to transition into the next move within a controlled number of counts and steps without forgetting or losing site of what she was doing.  If Leslie Sansone ever creates a workout video like ""Walk Away the Pounds"" without all of the chattiness and actually focuses on what she is doing, I will definitely purchase her workouts again.  All in all, I did drop some pounds with Leslie's workouts, but I feel that Denise Austin is more tolerable and efficient.",1433462400,,1288,4.62280701754386

I have lost several pounds (4 to be exact) within a 3 week period. Started at 157 lbs.  I am walking 2 miles, 3 to 4 times a week with this DVD.  I know 4 lbs may not seem like a lot, but I was only looking to lose 12 lbs and didn't want to starve or sweat myself to death.  This works great for my personality!  I expect to reach my goal by May 1st...I'm sure of it.",1425254400,3,475,3.607843137254902

The intensity isn't overly high and since you can mod all of the simple moves to how you feel that day, I would say give it a shot.

The music sucks, so I would kinda blast something else in the back ground, but still worth the few dollars you spend on the video.",1424736000,,535,3.7589285714285716

I got sick with pneumonia in January 2015 and couldn't do anything for over a month.  I bought this to help me recover and gain my fitness level back.  Much to my surprise, I love it.  It is so easy to follow and truly, anyone can do this.  The best part is that the workouts are very easy on the joints.  They are not high impact at all and you can modify if you need to.  Anyone could do these workouts.  I have lost two sizes since I stated in 2013 (I don't use a scale), but I had hit a plateau.  I have been doing these workouts for a week and I can already see that I am starting to shed more weight and inches.  I really enjoy these DVDs.  They are simple, you don't need much room in your house to do them, they are fun, and they clearly work.  I am 51 years old and am so happy to have found something to add to my collection of workouts and something that I will be able to do as I age.

The moves are regular steps, side steps, knee lifts, and gentle kicks. The 4 mile workout gets me working hard, and is not easy at all! It is much more intense than strolling for 4 miles outside.",1424390400,,390,4.144736842105263

Now I see that there is no need to own expensive fitness equipment, just these dvd's and the toning balls in different weights (2 and 3 pounds).

equipment needed:
1 mile: weights
2 & 3 mile: stretch band
4 mile: no equipment",1420243200,4,704,4.214814814814815

I actually miss doing it and after coming upon this in the review area, I really need to start again.  I like it because you can start at one mile and then progress over time.  It's easy, but great exercise.  The moves are also easy to follow since it's just variations of walking.  There is upper body exercise in it, as well.

3851856,5,B00265T7O2,"This was my first Leslie Sansone video purchase, and I feel like I got a huge bang for my buck! I bought this to do during my pregnancy, and the 1 & 2 mile walks were perfect to mix in with my prenatal workout DVDs. I miscarried recently and this was also a perfect way to gently get back into exercise after recovering. Now that I'm working out more intensely, I intersperse the 2 & 3 mile walks with my Gilad step aerobic DVD and Jillian Michaels 30 day shred on the weekdays, and do the 1 mile walk on weekends. I haven't tried the 4 mile yet, and I'm happy to have a goal to move toward. The exercises are all gentle and low-impact, but I'm always sweaty, even after the 1 mile.
All of the people in the video are dressed modestly (enough for my standards, anyway), and I love seeing the older fit women with gorgeous muscles-- so inspiring as I approach 40!
As an aside, I homeschool my 4 kids ages 7 & under, so it's great to have different lengths of exercises to choose from, depending on how busy our day is. I also LOVE the included stretchy band. I use 1lb weights for the 1 mile walk.

What I like about it is I don't have to go outside to exercise. Since I have a bad back, I don't want to walk too far away because if I get to hurting, I still have to walk back. Also, I don't have to worry about too hot or too cold weather, pollen in the Spring and fall. What I do is make sure I'm hydrated, have comfortable shoes on and will turn on the ceiling fan to keep cool. It's worth the money if a person wants to exercise without having to leave home.

She does a great job of explaining the moves, and of guiding you through the workouts.  I always find it to be a good workout, and I love that I can workout at home.  This is especially great in the fall and winter when it gets dark out so early.  I don't like walking outdoors after dark; so this allows me to get in my daily walk in the evenings, or on days when the weather keeps me indoors.

I haven't done anything differently - except for these exercises. I recently walked a 5K and finished it. I discovered that I was stronger than I thought. I never could have done it had I not been using this dvd. All that said, don't believe you are getting the same workout as actually getting outside and walking/jogging. It's not as strenuous.

I prefer to walk outside, but have learned from experience that if it's more that 80 degrees out, I can't do it. If I can't/don't wake up early enough to get out, I use this DVD. The one- and two-mile distances don't get my heart rate up enough. The three- and four-mile distances are a little better.

If you're a beginner or re-starting after not exercising for a while, this is an excellent place to begin (again). If you're more experienced, these might be too low-level for you. Leslie's talking and the moves are repetitive. When I've had enough of her voice, I turn down the sound. If I get bored with the moves, I improvise. Most days, though, I do the program as is. If you find that you're really in to her, she has lots of stuff on youtube. Oh yeah, this DVD comes with a ""stretchy band."" When it's not enough of a challenge I use handheld weights instead.

I will use it until I can get back to my group classes and figure out which of her many videos is more interesting.,1403222400,2,413,4.2025316455696204
3851941,5,B00265T7O2,"Resisted ordering a ""Walk"" DVD,  because I wasn't one of those ""old people"" who ""only"" walked. (I'm in denial, as I am past middle- age)  Finally, age, a 35lb weight gain, bad knees and reality set in.  My Jazzercise (told you I was old) days were over, if I wanted to get back into shape.

I was so wrong. Did the DVD for the first time today, the 2 mile. It was exactly what I needed.  I worked up a very solid sweat.  Leslie cues very well - know when a change is coming.  It was simple but not boring.  And my entire body felt engaged.  30 mins flew by.  It didn't feel a ""work-out.""  That is the best selling point about this DVD.  Doesn't feel like a ""have-to-work-out""  Simply feels like you are active and moving = healthy.  More incentive to stay with = not another 2 week exercise DVD.

Bottom line= Buy it - you are never too old or young!

UPDATE: The Four Mile Walk is a real challenge. Leslie and walkers move at a brisk pace, especially between miles 2 and 3.  If you can make it until the end of mile 3 the rest is actually very relaxing and nice cool down.  She slows the pace in mile 4 - still working out, but very doable.  On days that I have a lot of energy I do the 4 mile.  Otherwise, I do the 3 mile which is also a very good challenge - you are sweating and feel great at the end.",1403049600,10,1305,3.9844961240310077

Leslie is very positive and nice and doesn't make you feel like are being punished for choosing to work out.
The 2 mile brisk walk is my go to workout if I have an extra 30 minutes I can burn. The ""stretchie band"" gives it a little extra muscle workout without being too much. The 2 mile and 3 mile videos use the stretchie band which comes with the collection.
The great thing about Leslie's walking programs is that ANYONE can do these workouts. I am currently 23 weeks pregnant, and do the 2 mile walk almost every day. Although it seems like it these are light workouts, they gets results, even if you are in normal to good shape already.
Another good thing about these walking programs is that they are relatively easy, low impact, effective, and can be used for years and years in your weekly exercise routine.",1402963200,6,939,4.497076023391813

My favorite thing about this DVD is the variety in the group of walkers that Leslie has doing the workouts with her (it's a large group - 10 walkers!)

1. the walk routines do not require a lot of space as the walking is mostly done in place;
2. there are four different levels so I won't need to buy another DVD for awhile as I progress to higher levels of difficulty;
3. there are warm-ups, cool-downs, and other kinds of exercises combined with the walking to add variety and interest, work different muscles, and vary the intensity level within each ""walk;""
4. the upbeat personality of Leslie Sansone.

I can do these ""walks"" in my crowded living room (when no one is home of course!) without having to move furniture or have a dedicated exercise area. This means I can actually DO them.

The DVD includes walking-based workouts of 1 mile, 2 miles, 3 miles and 4 miles.  When I began exercising after several years of inactivity, the 1 mile workout was all I could manage.  After a couple weeks, I felt ready to move onto something a little more challenging--viola, the 2 mile, 30 minute, workout had me huffing, puffing and sweating!  The 2 mile workout was my go-to workout for the next few months.  But, unbelievably, I came to a point where I was stronger and ready to bump up my activity.  The 3 mile workout takes approximately 45 minutes.  At first it was a struggle.  I was dripping with sweat by the end, but it felt good!  So good that I eventually felt like I could take a plunge into that 4 mile, 1 hour workout.  Now I can take my pick, doing whichever routine fits into my schedule.

I think this routine is wonderful for any age level.  As a senior citizen, I found the low impact walking steps, which include walking in place, kicks, side steps, and knee raises to be just right.  The arms also are put into motion with some easy exercises like arm raises, pull downs and, in two of the workouts, the use of a stretchy band, which is included in the package.

Each workout starts slowly, gradually increases the pace and then slows again.  The workouts are also followed by some brief stretching activities.  I found that as my strength increased, my balance improved.  At the beginning, I had to balance with a hand against the wall or a chair when doing the stretching, but not anymore.

Leslie Sansone leads the workouts with a group of her walkers following her lead.  I now have several of Leslie's videos, but the Ultimate Collection is definitely my favorite.",1397260800,3,1933,4.561046511627907

3852004,5,B00265T7O2,"An actual fat girl, mind you. In my late 30's with lots of things that jiggle and wobble and flop around.  A doctor would tell you I'm morbidly obese.  Hopefully walking will help that, yeah?  I also have an iffy knee.  It's not ""bad"" , yet, but I don't lead with it going up stairs.  So... I've got some issues, I'm predominantly sedentary, and I need to move.

I love this DVD.  I really like the options it gives me.  The one and two mile walks are something I can easily handle, but I definitely know I've walked.  The three mile is very difficult for me, but I can do it.  The four mile is a little out of my range, at this point.  But, that just means this DVD will grow with my fitness level.

So, 1 mile.  She uses weights in this one, that I'm not sure are available anymore.  However, you can use any weights, impromptu weights (a couple bottles of water would work), or no weights at all.  I believe her weights are 1lb, each.  I found some nice 2lb each tube shaped weights that I use when I'm in the mood.  The walk is up beat, and it's over with before you know it.  You can really throw yourself into it, or take it easy.  Yeah, yeah, you can do that with all of them, but it's especially nice with the 1 mile.  For me, there's NO excuse not to walk this mile every day.  None.  Don't even try it, sister, just get up and walk.

2 mile.  No weights, she uses a stretchie band that comes with the DVD.  I really enjoy the band, and this walk.  And the more I do it, the more I enjoy it.  She has a lot of modifications along the way, ways to make things more or less challenging and I'm finding myself opting for the more challenge.  Which makes me feel like I'm accomplishing something.  It's easier to talk myself out of this walk, although that's sad because it only takes a half hour to do.

3 mile.  Oh wow.  This one is really difficult for me and I haven't gotten through it without taking the easy rout a time or four.  But, I'm looking forward to feeling more like doing this one more often  45 minutes.

I haven't tried the 4 mile.

My only complaint is that her stretching is difficult for my knee and seems too brief.  I do my own stretching at the end.  That's the beginning and the end of my problem with this DVD, and since I do know how to stretch, I'm not knocking off a star.  All in all, I think this is a great way to get myself moving.",1392336000,7,2370,4.069565217391304

I haven't tried the 4 mile walk yet, but miles 1, 2 & 3 are great.  I especially loved mile 1 (I used 3 lb weights).  Miles 2 & 3 were also perfect walks for me because Leslie doesn't overuse the stretchie band.

I wanted her DVD's though because I want to graduate from one mile a day to more eventually..and I really like her.. I can do these videos in a split screen on my desktop hooked to my 32"" TV and can turn the volume down and watch a TV show or movie in a side by side view.. it makes it easy to get through the walking which I tend to get bored with when I am alone. :) I am a genius for figuring this split screen thing out :) LOL.. anyway I think first time walkers and starters and couch potatoes who want to get healthier will love Leslie and these videos.. I have yet to try the resistance band which looks very wide and long..

The great thing about this workout is that the steps are so easy to follow. All you do is power walk, knee lifts, kicks and side steps, but you will sweat if you put in a good effort! Leslie also incorporates some arm workouts in. I like to use 5LB weights with this workout to kick up the calorie burn.  Leslie is very perky and energetic but not annoying, like some other workout instructors are. She has a mixture of young, middle aged and older people walking with her, so this workout is good for any age.

This workout is great for beginners but also good for those who workout a lot (like me). If you eat healthy and do this workout daily you will see results.",1390348800,5,842,4.066265060240964

For example if you wanted a six mile workout then you could do the two mile and then go to the four mile or vice versa.  But each mile has a faster pace.  It's a great dvd and a stretchy band is included.  But Leslie isn't using the stretchy band on the four mile segment . I already had this dvd, I ordered this copy for my sister , this was the first Leslie Sansone dvd that I bought and I haven't stop buying them yet.",1386028800,,596,3.813008130081301

Leslie keeps you upbeat and positive without sounding over the top.  This is it for me. I absolutely love it.  Already ordered her Belly Blasting Walk and I cannot wait to get it.

3852047,5,B00265T7O2,"This video has so many level options, with the 1, 2, 3, and 4 mile walks. I can definitely grow with this video. I love the addition of the stretchy resistance band to the walking video to involve all the muscles of the upper body and arms. I can see using this video a lot in the forseeable future, as the weather outside is starting to get quite cold in Kansas. This video definitely eliminates the ild excuse of it being too cold, and will help keep me going strong with my exercise goals all through the winter and after.",1383696000,,525,4.26

The movements are easy and won't hurt your knees, and you will feel terrific after you're done.

3852053,4,B00265T7O2,"If you are looking for a way to walk in your house and don't have a treadmill, this video is great! It has the 1-4 mile options, so depending on your energy level you have options to choose from. Generally I do the 2 or 3 mile one and get a great cardio workout. I actually have a treadmill, but I use this when I'm on vacation or travel (very easy to do in a hotel room!), or when I want to workout in a room without my treadmill.  The music in the warm-up section can get very repetitive and annoying, but after about 5 minutes it switches so don't let it turn you off! Her commentary can also get annoying, but after a few times of watching you really don't need it. So I actually turn the volume down, and watch something on my tablet while I'm doing this. Or I would just purchase the digital version (which I think they have), and then use it on your tablet so you can watch TV. You just need to keep glancing back to keep up with the rhythm. I find this to be a much more ""enjoyable"" way to do this workout.",1382832000,2,1014,4.01980198019802

I kinda found it hard in the beginning because I wasn't going anywhere just walking in place (lol). But this gave me a better workout. The small side steps and kicks are great (i could feel my thighs and butt getting a workout) The arm movements were a great change of pace something you don't do when your walking. I used 2 16oz bottles of Poland spring water, they are 1.6 lbs each. I can feel it in my shoulders....feels good actually to stretch those for a change. I only did the one mile and feel really good. Do the other mile this evening. I highly recommend this for  beginners you can slow down and just walk if it gets to much. :)",1382832000,,781,4.104575163398692

I am able to do this after my child goes to bed at night and I still feel like I am getting a good workout. I have begun to see changes in my arms and my overall energy level is very much improved after 2 1/2 weeks. I like that when it gets to the point I feel like stopping she tells you how you're burning fat and gives the little pep talk.

The workouts challenge your body, but don't require you to memorize a lot of complicated routines. I would not call this intense cardio, but I can get my heart rate 130's and sometimes higher if I really push hard. These are great for beginners or anyone who just wants a mid-level workout.",1378252800,,439,4.5

3852070,4,B00265T7O2,This is recommended for people who are older and unable to run to shed pounds faster.  She is very motivating.  Not everyone in the video is has a six pack.  She teaches you how to do low impact moving or you can switch up to a high impact movement as you advance in the program.  You and do one mile in any of the program or the whole program.  The tracking distance is great and encouraging.,1377043200,6,393,4.118421052631579

3852073,5,B00265T7O2,"I purchased this exercise DVD after reading the positive reviews. I'm so glad that I did. I have watched  the DVD all of the way through and have done the first two segments (1 mile and 2 mile back to back). I thought that it would be a very light workout and I didn't even expect to sweat. I was wrong. My heart rate was up and I sweat. Of course, being fit,  I put a bit more umpf into each move than what was shown (I squatted lower, stepped wider,  etc.)

The moves are very easy to learn. As much as I enjoy the fancy choreographed exercise routines, sometimes I just want easy mindless movement.

I didn't love the music and the exercisers were off beat sometimes but that wasn't enough for me to lower the rating. Overall, I recommend this for all fitness levels.

UPDATE : I've been using this DVD 5 days a week for nearly two months. On busy days, I just do the one mile walk(18 minutes) and combine it with Karen VOIGHT's Pure and Simple Stretch standing stretch (10 minutes). When I have more time I will do 2, 3, or 4 miles. I mix up how I get the miles. As long as I get a warm up and a cool down, it's good. On days I don't have time to do my upper body free weight exercise, I like to do the one mile walk as my first mile then I choose any of the other walks for mile 2 and end with a walk that has a cool down. On energetic days I do the 4 mile challenge.

I am getting great workouts by combining segments from my current three favorite workout DVD's : Walk away the pounds,, Karen VOIGHT's Pure and Simple Stretch and Women's Health Total Workout in Ten.",1376697600,2,1573,4.054838709677419

The price for this was absolutely amazing and you get 4 stages of workouts 1, 2, 3, and 4 mile ""walks"". These definitely work me way harder then walking outside does though! I would recommend this to anyone looking to start out in fitness, especially if your like me and have no interest in getting down on the floor (I just physically could not handle that). I am so glad Leslie has made a realistic program that gives beginners a chance to build up and improve their lives. Will be purchasing more of her DVD's to keep me occupied through the long winter!!

3852078,5,B00265T7O2,"I'm giving this a 5 star rating because, after years of difficulty sustaining an exercise routine, this was the answer.  It was recommended to me by someone who used to teach aerobics and at the time I ordered and received it I was post surgery (rotator cuff) and still in a sling. At that time I couldn't tie my own sneakers and I needed help dressing.  But I was getting restless so tried this wearing my nightgown and my clogs.  It was fine.  After that I used it almost daily, starting with the 1 mile and then going to the 2 mile which takes 1/2 hour.  When I got a little bored i turned down the sound and put music on with it.  It is so easy to follow along,  The work-outs go from 1 mile to 4 miles.  So if you're having trouble getting yourself moving, this is a great place to start.",1375488000,3,793,4.103896103896104

Leslie has newer dvds on the market however, this one is the BEST",1375228800,2,326,4.174603174603175

As I grew stronger I had begun walking on my own in the mall and neighborhood... but felt I had plateaued in what I could achieve fitness wise. Remembering the Sansone walk in place system... I ordered two of the DVDs. And... the programs totally kicked my butt the first few times. They are THAT superior to a simple walking-the-neighborhood program. Already I am increasing my ability to utilize the bands and weighted balls from another one of the series. I am extending my time... just increasing in my fitness level. I am THRILLED that I recalled and revisited Leslie's program... and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for more of a challenge than heading out your own back door.,1374105600,5,831,4.583892617449664

3852085,2,B00265T7O2,I had seen in the explanation of the DVD that somehow the talking could be turned off so only the music could be heard but there are absolutely no instructions to do that.  I am very disappointed because that is the only reason i purchased it because i already had the video.  I always mute it when i use it because i am so sick of hearing leslie's non-stop talking over and over every time i use it.

The 51 minute 3 mile walk is the best one because she uses the stretch bands rather creatively. It's more strenuous than what she calls the super advanced 4 mile walk. I personally would rather do Debra Mazda's Let's Get Moving, which is slightly more strenuous and a lot shorter. But I do recommend this workout if you really need to take it easy.

I also can't walk uphill due to the back condition and on top of that when the heat is really bad I know I won't last five minutes.  This is great because I pop the CD in, turn on my air conditioner and walk for half an hour in my own living room.  There are 4 different levels (from easy to hard) and I rotate the first 3 over and over (#4 is too intense for my level of fitness).
I can walk 1 to 3 miles (or less depending on the time available) no matter what the weather conditions and I also don't have to worry about what I look like when I walk outside (it seems like I always run into someone I know when I look my worst).  I seem to be firming up in the upper arm and belly area which is terrific.  If you are like me and really don't like to exercise but need to, this is the perfect way to do it.

She's infectiously chipper, coaches well, and is easy to follow.

It works, but gets boring, so thankfully there's 4 options on the disc, but the 1 mile walk seems hardly worth it. I do find it helpful that the stretchy band is incorporated but....only on the 2 and 3 mile walks.

Overall it's good for a beginner, and a calm break from other options. From what I've read on other reviews, this is probably the of best Walk Away The Pounds series.

My only complaint is that the one mile workout is an old workout placed on this new dvd and you are supposed to use weighted balls with it.  Both issues are easy to overcome, though.
About the workout: Like all of her workouts dvds this is a basic walking at home dvd.  All of the moves are easy to do and can be modified.  There are four basic moves-walk in place, side steps, knee lifts, and kicks.  They also add a hamstring curl every now and then.  If you cannot do something it is simple to just go back to walking in place. When I started this dvd program I was 50 pounds overweight and got winded walking up the stairs.  I also have some minor back issues.  I couldn't even finish the one mile workout.  I can now comfortably complete the three mile and I am losing weight.

The DVD was just sitting at his house for over a week.  (We don't live in the same town-about 2 hours away).  Went I had the first chance I went home and put on the video and basically showed it to him while we were talking randomness.  Next thing you know, the workout was over.

The videos are a bit cheesy but doable. Leslie has a LOT of hyper energy, but she's very encouraging. I use the 1 mile walk as a warmup and usually aim for the 3 mile or 4 mile if I want to get some exercise w/o having to schlep to the gym or do something too high impact.

I lost my first 10 lbs thanks to these videos! I've been ramping up my activity a lot since then and just use them as easy go-tos if the weather's bad and I need to get some activity in.

3852167,4,B00265T7O2,"I was very active for a while.  Going to the gym.  Working out two hours several days a week full out. I did it out of fear of getting diabetes and being put on medicine from my doctor.  I have two jobs and had to open up my hours in one which threw a stone into my workouts and good eating habits.  I gained back 40 lb that I had lost plus much more.  I haven't exersized in many months. I know I have to do something because I feel myself going downhill health wise, both mentally and physically. I originally bought another workout dvd and prematurely read the reviews wich were horrible.  I returned it and after walking past Walk Away the Pounds several times I decided to try it.  Thank goodness I did.  I am soo out of shape right now and this has given me great hope.  It has four workouts that help you ease back into exersize.  I completed the three mile workout today.  It made me sweat and feel good that I was getting myself going again.  It is not like other dvds where you are pushed beyound what you can do and you can alter it to fit your needs.  I live with family members and this dvd allows me to work out without a lot of jummping around that would disturbe them while they sleep.  I can do it in a very small space like my room.  Easy to follow.  All around good for me.  I have other dvds and things that I would pair with this, when I can, to get more of a core and strength training workout.  This is a much needed building block to work my way back to being a healthy, more energized, and more confident person.  Thank you Leslie Sansone for putting out these dvds.  (Other dvds I love that have helped me lose a great deal of weight in the past are cindy crawfords fitness dvds the next challenge being one, just watch your own form and don't follow hers, and Bob Harpers biggest loser dvd.  The one just with him. Sorry can't take Jillians put downs.)",1361404800,4,1879,4.149584487534626

3852179,4,B00265T7O2,"PROS - So far I have only done the first workout on this DVD and I really like it. The first workout is perfect for beginners...no complicated choreography, very little space required to do the workout, but it got my heart rate up and I feel it not just in my legs but in my upper body as well. I assume that the other workouts will be just as effective, and it's nice to get so many on a single DVD so I don't have to buy anything else as I progress!

NEUTRAL - This comes with a stretchy band, but you don't use it in the first workout, so I have no idea how well it works yet.

CON - Not conS because so far I only found one...in the first workout they use the ""walk away weighted balls"" which the description of the video didn't mention that you'd need. I have looked online even on Leslie's site and they no longer offer these, and I am not sure how much they weigh to get something comparable, so I just used some light hand weights that I had.",1360195200,,950,4.021164021164021

3852182,5,B00265T7O2,I chose this video because I wanted something low-impact to do while pregnant.  I'm used to doing The Biggest Loser and Jillian Michael's workouts but I had to modify those so much for pregnancy that I lost interest.  This workout has been great!  Walking is a great workout for pregnancy but living in Northern Indiana in the winter does not allow for walking outside.  So I've really enjoyed this.  It will be great after pregnancy also to transition back into the higher impact/intense workout DVD's I have or just for days when I want something more low-impact but still gets your heart rate up.  I would definitely recommend because it has variety depending on how much time you have.,1359936000,,689,4.7478991596638656

I am a 50 year old with arthritis in my knees and significant weight to lose, and this video is perfect.  She shows you the moves clearly, and gives ample warning before changing movements.  Best of all, she tells you what to do to modify a movement if it is beyond your ability right now, and has people in the group model those modifications.  It comes with the stretch resistance band, but you will also use ""weighted balls"" which are just 1 lb hand weights.  I didn't have the balls, but I found some 1 lb mini hand weights at the local sporting goods store that work just fine. I really like this routine, it's easy to pick up and Leslie is easier to follow and far less annoying than Denise Austin, whose video I bought at the same time.",1359417600,,913,4.153409090909091

3852189,5,B00265T7O2,"I'm not proud to say it, but I got out the habit of working out about 5 years ago.  That being said, this video is perfect if you are just starting back up working out after an extended amount of time or never have done a regular workout.  With a toddler, it is difficult to do a work out at a gym or even at home because my son was under foot.  With this workout, there are no worries that a child is going to get underfoot.  He actually loves to ""work out"" with me.  I have only done the 1 mile and 2 mile, and they both use 4 basic steps.  A basic march that increases in speed over the workout.  Knee lifts which are exactly what they sound like.  Side steps where you are basically doing a slide step back and forth.  Finally leg kicks where you just kick your foot forward.  There are a few other moves, but those are your bread & butter in the first two workouts.  Again, this workout is great if you are unsure where to start and want to get moving.

One suggestion though, stretch before starting.  There is a warm up time, but I found myself stretching during the workout to work out cramps.",1359244800,2,1101,4.112676056338028

3852192,5,B00265T7O2,"We usually got DVDs from the library and they were for a single length - 1 mile, 2 mile, etc..

Having 4 programs on 1 DVD allow you to easily choose what you want to do without digging through a pile of DVDs. The programs are upbeat, the music is ok, I don't really like Leslie Sansone as in, ""OMG I love her and she is my best friend and she is doing wonders for me!"", but I know I need to exercise and this is much better than just using a treadmill.

Even if you are doing this half-a$$ed, you find yourself getting a decent workout. Make sure you dress for it though - wear sneakers and socks, wear lose clothes, not jeans - otherwise it'll be just bleh. Because the programs are short, you can really get a mile in twice a day easy - the time goes by fast!

Do the 1 Mile twice a day if you are just starting out or just want to keep active. You have to do the whole program for the longer ones and you really don't want to stop in the middle of those since they have stages.

1 Mile Get Up & Get Started - 18 Minutes
2 Mile Brisk Walk - 30 Minutes
3 Mile Advanced Walk - 51 Minutes
4 Mile Super Challenge - 60 Minutes

The included stretchy band was great - surprised it fit in the DVD case! If you don't have weights or lose the band, the walking program still works.

For the price it's definitely worth it, but I know I will buy 1 or 2 more of the other DVDs in the series with multiple programs just for variety.",1358812800,2,1423,3.940766550522648

It was a great way to get back into shape and a great aerobic exercise for getting your energy level up after having a baby.  The weighted balls segments on the 1 mile walk video made dramatic changes in my arms and shoulders.  What a complement it is to have people tell you that you look as if you've never carried a baby, four months after giving birth.  I started her 1 and 2 mile series 6 weeks after the birth of my child and I've been hooked on her exercise series ever since.  The steps are not difficult to follow.

3852202,4,B00265T7O2,"I bought this DVD on recommendation from my physical therapist. Due to several old injuries, being 45+, and being 50 lbs overweight, I require a workout to get my heart rate up as well as increase my stamina without aggravating knee and hip joints too much.

The one-mile routine is a good beginner program. Be conscious of the fact that although a good starter level, it is a workout for those with limited range and abilities. The two-mile and three-mile workouts have higher intensity, and are a good follow-up to the one-mile routine. The exercises can be easily adapted to various levels a person is comfortable with working out; I don't use the weights as it's too painful for my shoulders and neck, but the exercises are still effective. There's enough of a challenge in these workouts that I don't think I'll become bored with them for quite some time.

The downside to this DVD is the constant chatter during the workout as other reviewers have noted. One of many reasons I workout at home is to avoid the pep talks and group chatter during a session. After about the third time through, I knew the routine well enough to turn down the sound of the video and use my personal workout music.

I recommend this product for the various routines you get on one DVD, the adaptability of the routine for those who may have to limit their exercise intensity, and the price is very good for what you receive.",1357776000,3,1408,4.601593625498008

I do a lot of walking outdoors when weather and daylight permit. This program allows me to walk anytime and adds upper body involvement through use of hand weights..
The instructors ( Leslie Sansone and Mary Kay no last name given) do a good job of keeping the class moving and preparing participants for the next move as the class progresses. This makes transitions from one set of moves to the next easy. I am not bored yet.
 Leslie mentions some general benefits of her program but I would appreciate some specifics beyond the ""exercise is good for you"" type platitudes sprinkled throughout the program. Leslie and Mary Kay are encouraging and enthusiastic, but Leslie often crosses the line into an over-the-top forced cheerleader peppiness and inane chatter. She also inserts some thinly veiled references to religion stopping just short of ""Praise Jesus"". I prefer my exercise straight up - sans evangelism.",1357430400,,1054,4.88268156424581

I like the music only version such as these following three titles: Burn Body Fat; The Big Burn: 2 Miles of Intervals; and 3 Miles Slim & Sleek Walk & Pilates. I offer that to you because I've spent a few hours researching to find out which ones offer music only, in case that is what you are looking for too. Leslie Sansone is so sweet and I love her inspiration and guidance on proper alignment and technique. However, after doing the same walk a couple times, you just don't want to hear it everytime, and the gibber gabber with the other walkers can get a little irritating. But, don't get me wrong, I LOVE these walk at home DVD's! I've already lost weight, and I feel SO much better emotionally and physically!

I started WATP 6 weeks ago and have lost 20 pounds so far!  I don't get board with these walks and I actually like her chatter, she doesn't take herself too seriously and that helps keep me going.

I never thought I'd say that and be where I am. Leslie is so encouraging and inspiring. She always seems to say what's on my mind and makes my stressful day melt away. I used to only work out for 20 minutes and think that was a big accomplishment. Now I'm working out an hour every night and I love it. I'm currently working on losing 20 lbs and it's hard because I work at a sedentary job during the week so I look forward to coming home now and working out, I'm hoping that this DVD will help me start losing weight and getting back to a smaller, happier me!

My mother had the 3 mile walk on DVD and was upset I broke her tape version so she never let me borrow hers :( I'm sure she paid more for her 3 mile DVD than I paid for mine.

The workouts are simple, this price is the lowest I've seen and most importantly, it works!  Walking and drinking water only has recently helped me drop 15 pounds.  I went from size 8 to 4. No dieting or calorie counting etc.  This is a great deal because you are getting 4 different workouts for the price of 1!  I never had the stretchy band b/c it was lost so very grateful they gave the stretchy band with DVD for free :)

Plus, the shipping was very fast b/c I ordered this DVD on Saturday afternoon and received it in the mail Tuesday.

3852244,5,B00265T7O2,"I must have looked at a dozen or more exercise videos before deciding to purchase this one. For starters, I'm 31, mom of 3 little kids, overweight, and have virtually no free time on my hands. I also can't afford a lot of equipment, nor do I have the room for stuff like that. But I can walk in place! What a concept!

Most of those other videos I looked at had comments like ""I'm already in really good shape and that was the best workout of my life!"" Well, I knew right away that those videos would be far beyond my current ability. I'm in really BAD shape and want to make a change in my life - but it's not going to happen overnight, and I had no desire to burn out on the first workout.

This video is fantastic for ""typical"" people like me who have little time or money, and really want to do something good for their health. The 1-mile walk is perfect if the kids are all in the room with me and want to try some of the movements: walking in place, kicks, side-stepping, and knee-lifts. It raises my heart rate, and I know I'm at least doing *something* good for myself. The 2-mile walk is my favorite so far, and I like to do it when my kids are taking their nap. It breaks a good sweat, keeps my heart rate elevated a bit longer, and requires a pretty good effort to keep up with the pace. The stretch band turns up the effort quite a bit more, but it's not overwhelming. Since I'm so out of shape, I haven't managed to do the 3 or 4 mile walks yet, but I really want to work up to those, and having them all on the same DVD is great! I still have a lot to look forward to.

I highly recommend this.  I love that it takes you from a beginner routine to a challenging workout with the 4 mile.  In four months I went from a couch potato, to being able to keep up with the fast paced four mile workout.  I'm not a very coordinated person, and learning new steps isn't very easy for me, but Leslie Sansone makes it easy for even the most klutzy person to keep up on the very first run through of her workouts.  This was worth every penny!  And it's so much easier to fit a workout into my day when it's in the comfort of my home.  I have two young children with lots of activities keeping us busy through the day, so sometimes I can't work out until long after they're in bed for the night, the convenience of a workout dvd is perfect for me.

I have been using this for over a year and now at a total weight loss of 70lbs.  This is still the only work out dvd that I use (I'm on the four mile walk now) and with using this 5-6 days a week it is still continuing to show results (along with healthy eating).

WAS I WRONG!!! First of all, I only made it to 2 mile and had to stop! I was sweating an having fun! Usually if Im exercising I feel exhausted! I love this DVD. This has given me hpe!!

The workouts on this disc are the same as the ones on her other discs. However, there are only 4 basic moves so how different can they really be?

Here is what I find annoying:

I wish that workout videos would be a little more believable. They all show people working out while wearing a huge, Cheshire grin. Most people do NOT smile while their working out. In this case, they're all grinning while sporting hairdos that are just a few years shy of a full out 1980's bouffant. How can anyone work out with all that hair hanging around their faces?

Also, ""Mary"", the woman right behind Leslie and to her left looks like a total spaz. She wears these huge, sloppy pants to work out in and flops around like a fish out of water. I'm not trying to be mean, but I find it VERY distracting. I

The last thing that I find annoying is this: Leslie NEVER stops talking, not even for one single second. Ever. She just blah blah blah's on and on through the whole thing. And of course, if you're using this video, you're hearing it every single day.",1337817600,3,1216,4.3392070484581495

Leslie's Walk Away the Pounds is amazing.  I can do all the basic steps and keep up with her and her gang of walkers.  The 1 mile was way to easy but a nice way to ease into working out.  I routinely do the 2 and 3 mile walks.  I sweat and huff and puff and feel GREAT when I'm done.  I haven't tried the 4 mile walk yet because the 3 mile is a big challenge for me right now.  I am more involved and committed to working out because I want to be able to complete the 4 mile walk.  Leslie is very easy to follow along, always giving plenty of notice when she is changing moves, and is very inspiring.

Before this she got no exercise.  Within a week we moved to the 2 mile walk and have been doing the 3 mile for 2 weeks.  In 2 more weeks we move to try 4.  I do it with light hand weights to make it a good workout for me.

I like walking early in the morning but it's too cold outside, and I like the convenience of just going in my living room and doing whatever program suits me that day. Leslie adds interest by changing up the steps frequently. It's all doable for those of us who are in our middle age  years. I really like the fact that she has a normal body (not ultra-sculpted or too thin) and her companions are ALL normal real size people of all ages. There's a few 50+ persons also. So, I feel at home w/these people since I'm 58.  The workout has really helped move me along in my stamina and gradual weight loss goals. I might even sell my treadmill! I hate the thought of going back to it after doing this program. They seem to go fast too. You start and the next thing you know, you're done. It's great.

Not being able to walk much during the winter due to the weather, this has opened up the opportunity to walk every day even if it's raining or snowing. And, to walk 2 miles in only 30 minutes is a great workout. The stretchy band helps round out this workout. You can work as hard as you want, or take it a little easier if you need.

I have only done the one and two mile walks so far, but I have to say I love Lesley and her friends - I find their positivity and enthusiasm very infectious. Nice also to see a wide range of age groups and sizes, not stick thin really fit people, though there is one woman in particular who looks like she does a lot more exercise than this dvd!

My son thinks the girl with the pig tails is particularly cute!

I hate exercising so find this is a great compromise. The area I live in is not one I particularly feel safe walking in, especially at night and one cannot always find a companion, so this fits in with my life very well.

It's my favourite exercise dvd as it just seems like fun and you still work up a sweat without feeling you are killing yourself!

I haven't done the 1 mile one because I'm in pretty good shape and figure why bother - not the best attitude, I admit, but if I have 18 minutes to do a work out video, I can probably make the extra 12 to do the 2 miles/30 minutes.  I haven't done the 3 miles, since it is only 9 more minutes to do 4 miles.  Also the 3 mile workout uses the stretchy band - I'm allergic to latex, so that's another negative for the 3 miles.  I should just try using hand weights in place of the stretchy band...  But I really like the 2 and 4 mile workouts.  I like Alton, I think is his name, 72 years old and in great shape.

3852296,5,B00265T7O2,"I was really glad to discover the Walk at Home DVDs.  This was my second purchase of approximately 8, and I feel it is one of her best for beginners.  While it's true that Leslie is extremely loquacious, she's not as verbose on this disk as on some others I've purchased.  And the filming, sound and entire feel is more professional than in other DVDs.

Leslie explains and cues well in this DVD.  The viewer has have an option to do 1, 2 3 or 4 miles.

For the 1 mile walk, hand weights (not included) are optional.  The 1 mile walk is a great beginner workout. In the 2 mile walk, the ""Stretchie"" is utilized.  The Stretchie is included, and it's a wonderful tool.  Mile 3 utilizes The Stretchie and provides a great workout.  As I'm not yet able to do all 4 miles at once, I do the first two miles and then do my own cool down.  It's very easy to modify these workouts to meet one's personal needs, and Leslie welcomes viewers to do so.  ""It's your walk"", Leslie tells us frequently - and she means it.  You can put a lot into her workouts, or just do a low-level walk.  I often change the steps.  Just keep up with the beat and you *will* get an aerobic workout.

All the miles are fabulous workouts for those just starting out with the program.  They're also great for intermediate walkers who may not feel up to doing any of the more advanced workouts or boosted walking (offered in other DVDs).

The music is rather bland but the volume is appropriate.  That said, it would be nice if the viewer were offered the option of having music without Leslie's narration (as is the case on other DVDs).

All in all, it's a great workout, remarkably effective.",1324166400,2,1658,4.321428571428571
3852297,3,B00265T7O2,"I love Leslie Sansone's walking programs especially the ones that include equipment like the weighted balls, so was thrilled to find this one with the stretchy band.  However, imagine my disappointment when I popped in the DVD and the 1-mile walk is the same 1-mile walk on the DVD with the weighted balls.  Would've liked a 1-mile workout with the stretchy band when I'm in a hurry, but not to be - at least on this DVD.  Thankfully, the other 3 workouts use the stretchy band, which I LOVE.  Adds a whole other dimension to the workout.  Some of the music - especially in the warm up - is annoying.  I think it is used on all 3 of the stretchy band warm ups.  And yes, Leslie talks a mile a minute throughout this DVD as well, but really wasn't expecting anything different.  All in all, a great workout.

1/28/16...I'm revising this review and changing my rating from 4 to 3 stars.  I hadn't done more than the 2-mile walk on this one but dug it out tonight for the 3-mile.  I can usually tolerate Leslie's chatter but on this workout, she is especially talkative to the point that it was hard to hear the beat of the music.  Her cues aren't as good in this one and there are quite a few spots where all her ""walkers"" are out of step with each other.  I enjoy the band element, but other than that, I don't think I'll be doing this one again.",1324166400,3,1345,4.2687747035573125

I bought the pedometer with it from Amazon and have dropped 15 lbs. in just 4 days.  I also cut my calories to 300-400 per meal and whalaa! I continue to lose weight.  Once I worked myself up to the 4 mile walk, I realized I could combine the one mile, the 2 mile and the 3 mile and thus almost put on the 10000 steps a day I needed giving me a total of 6 miles that day and in front of my tv set.  I just love it and would recommend it to anyone.

I'm posting again nearly 1 year later.  So far I've dropped 60 lbs. all together and couldn't have done it without my Leslie Sansome dvd, my pedometer, putting a minimum of 10,000 steps in a day and cutting my calories to a maximum of 400 per meal.",1320624000,3,870,3.773480662983425

I love that I can do the one mile a couple times a day if I'm pressed for time and can't do the 2 mile. Also I find that if I do the one mile in the morning I feel more energized in the afternoon and want to do it again because it doesn't totally wipe me out. I like that the DVD has up to 4 miles on it. I gave it 4 stars because the music on the 2 mile walk overpowers Leslie's voice. I don't really like the music but I would not have taken points off just for that reason. After all I didn't but it to enjoy music, but I do need to hear her cues clearly. It's not that hard to figure out what she is saying so I still recommend it. It's just annoying. You can do this in pretty much one spot, so space is not an issue.

Overall a fun workout, and great for a rainy day, but I'm not sure how she is getting the whole ""4 mile"" estimate.

It is great to stay in shape, cut cellulite, reduce stress, and feel energized. It is challenging but not so tough that you feel you can't finish. It is very do-able which is what I love.

Lo and behold, the 2 mile mile walk on both DVDs is the SAME!  I feel deceived.  I had no idea that Leslie repackages her workouts into new DVDs.  I really do like her workouts so I gave this set three stars.  This package of four walks (including a stretchie band) is a good deal if you don't already have other walks.",1315353600,7,610,3.9834710743801653

I do it because it will keep me from having to end up using one of those motorized shopping carts and I can eat more and still lose weight. What I like about Leslie Sansone's workouts are that they are flexible, comprehensive and on this DVD I can choose a quick and dirty 18 minute workout or on days of more time and energy I can choose the 4 mile.

She also has a person in each workout modify the motions. So if you are a beginner or have a health issue such as arthritis you can still get the benefit of a structured workout without injuring yourself or make it so painful and discouraging that you quit. Last summer I had back surgery and residual numbness in one leg. I was barely able to make 1/2 mile.

3852313,5,B00265T7O2,"One of the biggest problems I have in maintaining a regular exercise routine is finding the time.  I enjoy walking and try to incorporate it as much as I can in my daily life.  However, there are days when it's rainy, cold, or I just need to get from point A to point B quickly so walking is out of the question.  Leslie Sansone's Walk Away The Pounds is the solution to my problem.  This video has 4 walking options.  The first is a 1-mile walk that lasts only 20 minutes but that 20 minutes includes a warm-up, some weight work, and a nice little stretch at the end.  This is perfect for me because I can always find 20 minutes in my day to do it. Leslie is cheerful but somewhat low-key.  She encourages without going over the top with enthusiasm.  She offers gentle alternative moves for the weight work in case you are unready or unable to go all out.  I love that!  I have some neck and knee issues so I really appreciate the overall gentleness of the 1-mile workout. Despite that, I do break a sweat and feel that I've really worked out.  Don't let the title fool you, you are not doing a casual little walk here--it's a workout. I also like that the video participants are diverse in terms of age and body type. Will you walk away the pounds?  I cannot answer that.  I am a lifetime member of Weight Watchers which is where I first heard about this video.  I am not trying to lose weight but I do know that this workout has helped me maintain my current weight.  I've had days where I've gone overboard on cookies, candy and other potentially fattening treats, yet I haven't gained weight overall.  I credit this workout for that.  By the way, I haven't even moved on to the 2 mile walk yet, but I'm looking forward to that this winter when it is very difficult to walk outside on a regular basis.",1311984000,2,1805,4.277286135693215
3852314,5,B00265T7O2,"Love these dvd's!  I am in my late thirties and a recent grad school graduate.  Over the past three years, I have been steadily gaining weight and in the last 6-7 months I finally reached my tipping point when I realized I gained 15 extra pounds total. I am 5 ft. 5 inches and at my last Dr.'s appointment, I was told that I was one pound away from being considered overweight.  Working on a thesis and constant snacking throughout reaIly did the trick.  I found that half of my wardrobe no longer fit. I was getting ready to throw in the towel and just accept the extra pounds but the truth is, I felt less confident and my energy levels were way down.

The other thing I should mention is that I have been walking for the past 5-6 years on a daily basis for at least 30 minutes a day within my neighborhood.  These walks are great however, since gaining weight, I really needed something a little bit more high impact in order to lose those extra pounds.  I never thought I would enjoy working out with a dvd so much.  Leslie is so encouraging, warm and motivating to workout with!

I have only been doing the dvd's for a little over 5 weeks and I have already lost about 10 pounds. I am not a dieter by any means and have never been so these dvd's really work.  As Leslie points out, ""so many times, it's not about the food.""  I do at least 3 miles a day for 4-5 days a week using this dvd and the 5 mile fat burning dvd for variety.  Maybe once a week, I will do 4 miles.  In all, I dedicate about 30-45 minutes to working out.

I have realized that to keep my weight within a healthy range and to help me further feel more confident about how I look, I am going to have to incorporate these dvd's into my lifestyle.  Once I go back to my desired weight, I will probably only do about 2 miles a day and see what that does.  In all, I love the results on my body.  The cellulite on my legs is less defined, my waist is smaller, my face is more defined (making me look younger), and my clothes fit like they used to.

I highly recommend her dvds!",1311984000,30,2048,4.090225563909774

I chose this one specifically because it had 4 of the older workouts on it and the fact it comes with the stretchie band. I am really enjoying these workouts and find using the band rather than the weights seems to work different muscles.

3852319,3,B00265T7O2,"I've been pretty sick with lung, heart and thyroid illnesses. Hypothyrodism totally freezes the metabolism and caused a lot of weight gain; along with the symptoms had me down for a few years. Through prayer for my physical, mental and emotional health and healing, I was guided to stop eating meat, add more whole grains, fruits, vegetables and healthy non-animal proteins; as well as add regular exercise. I joined a medically supervised weight-management program. Walk Away the Pounds was one of the referred exercise dvds. The price was good and she has 4 different levels of walking and some strength, stretch and toning incorporated. Along with giving up meat, doing a parasite cleanse and detox, this dvd is helping me to gradually regain my breathing, strength and agility. Being a very rythmic person with African roots, the good moves and music were missing for me. It makes it a little boring and mote; so I turn it down and pop in the movie the wiz with Michael Jackson and Diana Ross and such great music and motivational information and this keeps it lively for me. In the long run, it feels really good to go from barely making it to the corner to walking 2 miles in a short period of time. This dvd goes from a 1 to 4 mile walk and fitness workout, each separate. If you've been immobile and/or just want to get in shape this is a good place to get started...I hope this helps.",1310083200,15,1393,4.598393574297189

I purchased, ""Walk Away the Pounds"" Ultimate Collection. I didn't expect too much from it because I thought it was mainly for REALLY overweight or older people. Sorry, I'm just being honest. Anyway, I started with the ""1 Mile"" and I needed more so I did the ""2 Mile."" I added hand weights in as well. Let me tell you, this is really a good workout for EVERYBODY! Nobody would fail on this workout routine! It's fun, not strenuous, and it burns CALORIES! I burned 509 calories doing the ""1 Mile"" and ""2 Mile"" workouts. Remember, I had impaired knees, so I wasn't going at full speed. Next time, I will skip the 1,2,3 Mile workouts, and go straight to the ""4 Mile"" to see if I burn even more calories.

Don't underestimate this workout!!! Yes, it's more for beginners, elderly, but it is also suitable for intermediate and advance exercisers when you want a light and productive workout!

I play Squash, hike our local Sedona rock formations, walk the dogs, workout with bands and Body Bars. But, Leslie has refueled my tank of workout enthusiasm. This is my first Leslie Sansone DVD, and I love the variety of workouts. I have a home based business and other things to attend to during my very full days. If I don't have time for a 4-mile walk, I can do the 1-mile, especially on hot summer days, or our surprisingly cold winter nights (yes, we get snow in Arizona!). But, most of all, I love Leslie's enthusiasm and loving encouragement. I also like the fact that the people who work out with her are real people, with beautiful bodies in a variety of shapes and sizes (of which I have been at various stages of my life). I've done the ""other guy's"" P90X series which is a lot of pushing for perfection, alignment, and feeling the burn. Yes, it's good stuff, but Leslie Sansone is for real people, and promotes a perfectly healthy lifestyle. I'm not in training for a sports tournament. I just want to feel good and healthy enough to chase those grandchildren that I hope to have someday. That's what these DVDs are made for. Amen sistah! I'll be purchasing more DVDs.

3852324,5,B00265T7O2,"Many years ago, my mother bought a VHS of Walk Away the Pounds. I remember it very well, from the weighted balls to the one guy stuffed all the way in the back.

Then, some time in 2005-ish, I bought a DVD with the 1 and 2 mile express workouts.

This year, I bought this DVD.

I will admit, I find it VERY odd that the one mile walk with weighted balls was put in this, since it seems like it'd make more sense to include the one mile express walk, however, it doesn't matter to me since I have a copy of the missing express walk, and the weighted ball walk takes a little over twenty minutes to complete.

As for how effective these walks are, I'll say this much. I did nothing but the walks on this DVD seven days a week for thirty days. My bodyfat% went from 16% to 13%! I would recommend these walks to anyone of any fitness level! Even if you have the most hectic life in the world, For one hour, you can walk four miles, or less miles in even less time! It truely is a no-excuse walk. You'll fall in love with the entire cast, and even Leslie's bizarre penchant for going off on a health rant, leaving you and the class doing double knee-lifts for twenty minutes!",1308009600,6,1170,4.118421052631579

3852326,5,B00265T7O2,"9 days ago I began this program in ernest after spending several months as an out of shape (40 lb. overweight) couch potato.  Today (9th day) I did the 4-mile walk.  I own many of Leslie's videos.  Some I have to work up to, but for now this 4 mile walk will do.  I can already feel a difference in my core muscles & my inner thighs are slightly smaller.  I was exhausted last week, but this week I am full of energy, and I just feel better.

Even if you have been strolling around the neighborhood do the 1 mile walk to become accustomed to the steps and challenge yourself with the 1 lb weights.  Note:  The DVD does not include the weights, like the old VHS version did.

Increase to the 2,3 & 4 miles when you are no longer really challenged.  Yesterday I realized that although I was ""done"" at the end of the 3-mile walk, I didn't feel as challenged, so I moved up.  You won't be giving this video away even after become used to the 4-mile walk.  LIke regular walking you can always pop it in and take a walk.  I probably progressed faster because I've been walking for years and years. (even though I'm really out of shape right now.)

Take it at your own pace and just keep moving.  Leslie's upbeat and fun attitude make this workout super fun.  It's not easy, but the time passes very quickly.",1307059200,8,1301,4.227642276422764

I found a 2 mile walk on youtube and told myself if I could do it for three weeks I would buy the dvd.  At first it was difficult, I could keep up with the walking but the upper body (arm) movements and stretching were very difficult for me.

After 13 years of step aerobics 4-6 times a week, at 57 I've found myself with arthritic knees, Plantars Faciitis, Plantars Fibroma, and I've had my big Toe operated on for Hallux Rigidis.  I stopped the Step Aerobics about 2 years ago when a doctor said I'd need a Knee Replacement if I didn't.  I started lifting weights, which is great and I love it...but wanted something CARDIO to burn calories too.  I tried the treadmill (boring) the elliptical (boring), and was really thinking I wouldn't find anything.

Then I ordered a Walk at Home video by Leslie and realized that I'd found what I've been looking for.  I enjoy her walking videos so much that I actually walked every day this week as opposed to skipping 2 or 3 days like usual.  I can choose from 1, 2, 3 or even 4 miles depending on how I feel and how much time I have.  I LOVE IT. I did the 4 mile after 2 days and actually felt great afterwards!  I also enjoy Leslie who is upbeat and positive and empathetic to the needs of those who may be challenged.

I am so excited to have found this program.  I bought this DVD after the first one and I am really enjoying it.  It's great for all ages, but for those of us 50 somethings with joint and muscle issues...this is the answer.

3852341,5,B00265T7O2,"This dvd is my ""go-to"" exercise dvd of choice as it contains walks for both the novice to the veteran. This dvd is so good and helpful that you can use it either in your home or on travel as it houses all levels of walking (from the one mile to the four mile) on one dvd. The dvd ultimate collection is also a wise purchase economically as it is uber-friendly priced and, once again, it has all levels of walking right there on one dvd. There is no need to be switching out dvds and this cuts down on time, energy and the risk of getting the dvd scratched. Also, the music is upbeat and Leslie verbally guides you gently and easily through each mile walk. Each walk is very easy to follow. There are no complicated moves or tricks. In fact, the ease of use is reinforced by the exercisers who back up Leslie on this dvd as they represent all levels and walks of life from the young adults to the most mature. This dvd is definitely a prize and should be added to any exercise dvd collection. I promise that you will never tire of it and, instead, you'll find yourself reaching for this dvd over and over again as I do. And, despite the fact that Leslie is an exercise instructor veteran and has produced many other exercise tapes in her lifetime, somehow she ALWAYS makes each dvd unique. So, if you have the other Leslie Sansone walk-at-home dvds there is no worry about exactly repeating past routines. Leslie is a guru and never disappoints her fans.

I am no exercise guru, but it is one of the few that gives a decent warm-up and cool down.  At least, Leslie Sansone brings up this issue.  So many workout dvds do not.

Another positive to this routine is that the steps are simple and her transitioning to the next move is always preceded by a 4 count or something so you can prepare for the next step.  It is so annoying when you miss the next move and try to catch up on some of the more complicated routines.

Also, because of the simplicity of her power walking moves, she shows you how to put some extras into it by using this stretchy band thing and ball weights.  I didn't have ball weights, so I used 3 lb hand weights--and it does crank it up.

The simplicity of it all sort of inspires you to keep going--because you can see this is doable and maintainable.  We don't have to learn how to contort ourselves into human pretzels or do dance moves on the first go like Julianne Hough.

This is a good one, people.  You will like it.  For those of you who are more advanced, add weights, resistance bands, etc.",1297900800,4,1241,4.247863247863248

I have purchased over the years around a dozen of Leslie's DVDs/VHS and have been using them for the past ten years with great results in my health, stamina and emotional well being.  That's right, not only do you lose weight and improve your muscle strength and health but this is also great for stress management/reduction. The moves are simple but effective and fun.  This DVD includes 4 complete workouts and a stretchie band which makes this DVD an exceptional bargin.  I prefer the group exercise videos because it feels like I am in an exercise class but with the convenience and privicy of my home.  During the cool down phase after the 4-mile walk Leslie talks about the importance of regular exercise, proper nutrition and sleep in maintaining good health.  This I already knew but it's nice to be reminded. Love this DVD! It was worth every penny.",1297555200,,1329,4.485477178423237

I have been doing her videos for a while and I have definitely seen an increase in my energy level and stamina.  At first wasn't sure what the stretchy band was.  Now I LOVE IT! It really does work deep in the muscles and it a good addition to this video. It is included and it is a tool you can use separate from the video too.

3852358,5,B00265T7O2,"I bought this DVD and received it a few days before Christmas.  First let me tell you that I started on my weight loss odyssey about 5 months ago, weighing 384 pounds.  I started dancing to my Ipod for 5 minutes.  Eventually, I increased my exercise time to 35 minutes with a routine I developed based on past gym experiences.  It worked--I lost 75 pounds by Christmas, using my own routine.  But it got old and too easy and I realized I needed something a bit more taxing.  I checked out various exercise DVDs via fitness TV and even the so-called low impact exercise sessions were simply too fast and too high impact for someone weighing what I do/did.  When I popped this DVD in, I really didn't expect much.  I started with the 1 mile walk on Christmas Day and surprisingly was able to keep up and follow Sansone's cues.  A few days later I tried the 2 mile walk and surprised myself by being able to do the whole session.  It was hard, I won't lie.  But I managed to do the 2 mile for the past month and have seen amazing results.  I had hit a plateau with my weight loss but when I started Walk Away the Pounds, I began losing again.  I've lost 16 pounds since starting the DVD--during a very trying period.  When I walk outside, I don't lose consistently.  When I do the Sansone DVD, I lose weight everytime.  3 Days ago I started the 3 mile walk.  I had gotten a bit bored with the 2 mile so thought I'd probably not be able to handle the 3 mile but gave it a try.  I've done it 3 days now and I won't lie...it's hard for this heavy body to keep up but I'm doing it!

If you are a very heavy person, like me, and you don't think you can do an exercise program like this...you can!  I have the knee problems and back problems morbidly obese people typically have.  I can't say I love doing the workouts.  I love it when I finish them to be honest.  And, my body hurts while I do them.  But the improvements I've seen in heart rate, stamina and my mood make me continue.  If you're a really heavy person who's desperate to find something you can do, I encourage you to try this DVD.",1295740800,423,2088,4.14713216957606

But, I opted to give it a go and was very surprised to find that this DVD offers a really good all over workout.  It has been a while since I exercised per say -  I mean I get lots of exercise keeping up with the kids, walking up and down stairs, yada, yada, yada.  So when I started with the 1 mile walk I was amazed at the various muscles I actually felt getting worked out!

a) Is really easy to use - I am ready in my shabby old gear in minutes and off we go, in what feels like no time at all 1 mile is gone and I'm feeling as proud as if I've done a marathon! (Remember, I'm a sloth, so this is really important stuff for me)

b) Is nice to use - Leslie is permanently cheerful and yet still sound sincere, easy to listen to and keeps it interesting

I was amazed that I did 1 mile the first session - had not expected that.  I've also been motivated to use it a couple of times a week and it has also helped me set a better pace for walking when I am outside - all good stuff.

Even after a few weeks I am feeling stronger, better aerobic capacity, that little ""perk"" you get from exercising regularly, find I am more flexible and I was surprised at the improvement in upper body strength.

So I decided to try Leslie Sansone's method. When she said ""fat burning"" or ""burning calories"", I thought: she is just kidding. But, after about three months, walking 3 miles / 6 times a week, I've lost 17 pounds, and my wife 15 pounds, without changing anything in our food!

Being over 50 myself it gives me hope that I can feel good & look good without being model skinney with 6 pack abs. In other words, this work out is for normal people. Leslie's voice is also very encouraging. The walk goes quickly, but I have a sense of accomplishment when I'm done. I highly reccomend this video.",1280707200,7,642,3.9844961240310077

When it is on a new DVD-it needs to be new-I am guessing that they are all recycled from earlier DVD's-but since I only have about five-I don't know that for a fact.

3852383,5,B00265T7O2,"I'm 67 years old, and was fit for my age before purchasing several Leslie Sansone tapes.  (My two favorites, Walk Away the Pounds; Walk at Home, 5 Day Slim Down).  I started working with the tapes four or five days a week, alternating, sometimes, with outdoor walks.  I found my outdoor walks far more pleasurable.  I felt more and more fit.  My blood pressure came down to 117 over 67 without medication.  I didn't lose much weight -- 4 pounds -- but I wasn't very overweight to begin with.  I felt fitter than I ever have, and my friends and family noticed.

Then one day I walked for twelve hours on pavement in New York City in floppy flats.  (What was I thinking?)  And got a stress fracture of my second metatarsal.  I was bereft -- all that hard work to get fit and now I had to be off my feet for most of the day for weeks, perhaps months.  I bought a walker with wheels and a seat, a wheelchair, a cane -- all the accoutrements of a person with an injury.  And I became very, very down.

One day a friend suggested that I do the Leslie Sansone tapes sitting in my walker (which elevated my feet a few inches off the ground when I was sitting).  I thought, why not, and started.  I did all the motions to the best of my ability without my feet touching the ground.  It involved, I realized, developing a great deal of core strength.  From the first day, my mood improved; I felt as if I was taking good physical care of myself to the best of my ability.

As I recovered, I started doing the 2 mile brisk walk on Walk Away the Pounds, a little at a time.  5 minutes, standing the first week.  7, the second.  I'd complete the tape sitting.  Slowly, my strength came back.  I believe this regimen aided my recovery and certainly improved my mood.  I didn't feel like an invalid, but like someone temporarily inconvenienced, and on the mend.  It's nine weeks since my injury, and I can now do the tape, standing, for 20 minutes!  I'll add another 5 next week.  And soon I'll be doing the whole tape.

Without these tapes, I suspect I would have lost far more muscle strength than I have.  I look forward to regaining what I'd lost, thanks to using these tapes.",1279670400,31,2165,4.261083743842365

3852391,5,B00265T7O2,"Living in steamy South Florida one can understand seeking an indoor workout solution in the summer. I found  Leslie Sansone's ""Walk Away the Pounds Ultimate Collection"" DVD to be an excellent tool to get in shape and lose weight. This truly is an Ultimate Collection.

Besides filling the bill of being ""an indoor workout solution"" this DVD is a deal at $9.99. I avoid the monthly gym membership fee by being creative in my fitness routine.  However, I have wasted money in the past purchasing DVDs even after reading great reviews. Sadly, those exercise faux pas collect dust or end up in the Goodwill donation bag. I think we can all relate to this disappointment.

 This collection gives you 4 choices: 1 Mile Get Up & Get Started, 2 Mile Brisk Walk, 3 Mile Advanced Walk, 4 Mile Super Challenge.  I walked all four episodes and my favorite is the 3 mile walk. This is my fav because Leslie uses the purple resistance band (comes with your DVD). I like the variety of walking (side to side, shimmying forward, leg lifts, leg kicks, and arm raises). If I feel particularly challenged after walking 3 miles while still walking I fast forward to the 4 mile walk (skipping the warmup) and then just keep going til I decide to stop.

All exercise DVDs I have used have had one thing in common. Maybe you can relate. The person leading the workout starts to irritate me about the 3rd or 4th time I watch the DVD. Maybe you can relate to this? Sometimes the reason simply is too much of the person and not enough focus on the actual exercise. Basically, the big personality steals the show.
 Leslie has the opposite effect on me, personally. She is an encourament in that she allows me to feel that I am just not viewing the DVD, but I am a part of her group getting in shape, enjoying the camaraderie of the girls (oh sorry there is one guy in the group). I wear an Ipod shuffle now cause how many times can you listen to her repeat what she says? When I do decide to listen in I smile because she is so uplifting, and humble in that she is coming alongside her walkers and relating to them. She shares that she agrees we all may eat too much but it isn't the food that is causing us to gain weight (then she adds - well - maybe it is) but then goes on to inject us with some reminders to hydrate and turn on the DVD whenever we want to feel better about ourselves. And I love this! She reminds us that the walking does work and not to give up. And none of this talk is patronizing or infomercial-oriented. She is the girl next-door - someone that would teach a women's bible study in her home and meet you for tea just because you needed a friend in your hour of need.

Call me crazy but the only flaw in this DVD is that I may just wear it out from playing it too much! Save your money and skip each individual DVD workout she has out there up until the Ultimate Collection. Toss that membership discount and free trial ad that arrives in your mailbox every month. We all know that costs more than we need to spend these days. This exercise method works and is enjoyable to watch.

Go grab your sneakers, turn down the air, work up a sweat and.....Walk Away the Pounds! You knew I had to give this product one last plug. I know Leslie would thank me for my kind review. I can hear her girlie girl giggle - the same one I hear everyday for 3 miles ...but whose counting....just counting the pounds that walk away each day.

She also says - Hippocrates said it best when he proclaimed, ""Walking is man's best medicine.""",1276992000,3,485,4.586206896551724
3852394,5,B00265T7O2,I hate to exercise!  My daughter kept after me to do something.  I decided that I would try walking at home.  This video is perfect!  It really gave me a workout.  I started slow with the one mile walk and have rapidly progressed to the 4 mile walk.  Who would have guessed!  I have suddenly become hooked on walking after all these years.  Thanks so much for all your help Leslie!  I highly recommended this video to anyone of any age.,1275868800,3,436,4.283950617283951
3852395,4,B00265T7O2,"This workout is fun and motiviating - I usually do the three mile on days that I don't feel like going outside to work out.  Definitely a good alternative to a group exercise class at the gym.  Leslie's style is good - motivating and positive without being obnoxious.  However, there are a couple problems.  First, the music is too low in the mix.  You are supposed to time your movements to the tempo of the music, but it is so quiet that you have to turn the audio way up to be able to hear it well, which makes Leslie's instructions super loud.  Also, Leslie's cueing is sometimes a little off.  She's OK generally, but there are a few times where she's hard to follow unless you've done the workout a few times - especially the obnoxious thing she does where she counts down the number of reps you have left and then, when you get to zero, she says ""Don't stop! Don't stop!"" and has you do more...sometimes a couple times in a row.  It's not that I mind doing more reps, it's just hard to follow.  That being said, I would definitely recommend this DVD to others.",1274054400,3,1067,4.321608040201005
3852396,4,B00265T7O2,"I bought this DVD upon the recommendation of a friend.  I had never heard of a ""walking program"" before and was honestly mystified by the concept: I'm going to walk in place in front of my TV?  Well . . . yes.  Sorta.  Once I popped it in I realized that the program is designed to suit people who are either new to fitness, don't like aerobics, or don't like to dance/think they are uncoordinated.  In reality, this video is not a huge departure from a low impact aerobics routine.  The difference is that the movement repertoire is pretty limited and Leslie presents the movements as variations of walking, and thus makes them less scary.  If you really have two left feet, then Leslie's approach is a big plus!  If not, it might get a little boring.  Personally, I love to dance, so I docked it a star for not being quite my cup of tea.  Having said that, if you choose the appropriate mileage for your fitness level, you will work up a sweat, and it was more engaging than I would have expected from walking in place in front of my TV.  As the other reviewers have noted, the production quality is good and cueing is well done.  If a walking program sounds like something you'd like, then this is a great product.  If you're more accustomed to aerobics/dancey-ness, you may want to look elsewhere.",1273968000,6,1301,4.438818565400844

The nice part about this is you can do this inside and do a short version walk that takes less than 20 minutes, and still get a great workout in a short period of time. I really do recommend this to anyone who wants to start and also challenge themselves as they work up to the longer walks.",1270857600,2,457,3.924731182795699
3852400,5,B00265T7O2,"I got this DVD a couple of months ago, finally got started a couple of weeks ago on the 1 mile walk which I can do with some effort. I decided to change it up with the 2 mile walk this week and boy, did I get the surprise of my life. I am 60, 5'7"", 225#, completely and totally out of condition and I could only do 1.5 mi of this walk. It is not Leslie's fault, it is mine, but be forewarned, if you cannot do the 1 mile walk with your eyes closed and pretty much without breathing hard, it is going to be nearly impossible to do the 2 mile walk which is much, much, much faster. It is good to feel the sweat and the heart rate increase but seriously wonder if I need to go back to the 1 mile walk for a couple of weeks.  I also seem to have a tremendous coordination problem (again, my fault, not Leslie's) but I cannot seem to keep up the pace and do the arm work???  Clumsy, uncoordinated, out of condition, you name it, but for me, it is either walk OR do the arm work so I just keep changing things out to keep moving, walking, kicks, knee lifts, side2aside and back kicks and don't worry about the arms except to keep them moving. I really like Leslie Sansone and this DVD, it is peppy, optimistic, some talk with accompanying exercisers but not too much and am sure, with dedication and practice, will be doing the 4 mile walk by the end of the year.

This dvd worked for me. It has 4 seperate work outs ranging from 1-4 miles. I started w/ the 1 mile since it had been a while. Once I got back in the groove I moved to the next level. I've been using this since January and  haven't gotten bored yet. The workouts are simple yet effective. I loved it so much I purchased it as a gift for a friend.,1268092800,,508,3.8846153846153846

3852408,5,B00265T7O2,"If you are looking for something you can do repeatedly and enjoy so that you look forward to your workout, this is it! The production values are better than some of her older DVDs, IMHO. This is really 4 1-mile workouts, 3 2-mile, 2 3-mile an 1 4-mile...I do the long ones on weekends and the short ones on weekdays.  I do have other DVD's that I do too, some also Leslie, to vary things up.  But this one practically lives in my DVD player.  One of my favorite 3-miles is miles 1,2,and 4 of the 4 mile.  More variation can be gotten by doing the 2 and 3 miles with and without the stretchy band.  And the one mile thinks you have weight-balls, but only the band comes with this...so I just use (or not) a couple water bottles.  The point is you can do as much or as little as you want and that keeps it something you can commit to. You can start easy and build up, whether by adding miles/time or by starting with just the feet and later adding the arms and the stronger leg movements. Some days you just can't do much...but you can almost always do something.  Some days I feel like I will be lucky to do 1 mile...but I have learned if I start the 2 or 3-mile, saying ""I give myself permission to stop at 1 (and stretch!)""...I usually start feeling better and do the whole thing!

3852411,5,B00265T7O2,"I've purchased many workout videos in the past and this may be my favorite and the one I am most likely to do regularly.

I started with the one mile walk, and as an overweight but active individual in her late 20's, I was working up to a sweat by the end of it. I've now moved on to the two mile walk and feel like I've gotten a really good cardio workout in by the end of it. I haven't done the three mile or the four mile yet, but I will this weekend!

What I like:
* The simplicity of the moves - I'd never purchased a indoor walking video before - but with four simple moves (Step, kick, knee lift, and side step you don't need to be coordinated or have good balance to complete a good workout. (Though I do consider it to have 5 moves really including the kickback.)
* The variety of her workout partners - she has REAL people in the class with her of varying ages, body types, fitness levels, and always has one man so it's not only ladies.
* Good modifications for various levels of fitness - Along with the ""real"" workout partners, there are good examples of different modifiers to make the workouts harder or easier. On a day when I'm feeling a little slow or tired - I'll pick out one of the more moderate walkers, and try to use her as my 'walking buddy'. But - for the days that I feel like pushing myself - there is always someone who is REALLY going for it and putting their all into it. I love being able to pick one person to watch and set myself with depending on the day.
* Leslie's pace & modifiers - I like that Leslie herself is often the one to set the moderate pace. She's never the one lifting her knees the highest, and this makes it easier to learn the DVD, to keep up, and to stay motivated that you can do it.
* The timing of the mileage cue's - So far I've only done the 1 & 2 mile, but I like the pacing of the cues. For the one mile you get a note and a bar at the bottom of the screen for every 1/4 mile. For the 2 mile you get one ever 1/2 mile. It helps keep me motivated to push just a little harder.
* The cues for the exercises - almost all the time Leslie is very good about letting you know what move is coming up, and how many more moves until you get to it.
* The pace of the music - the music is really good about helping you speed up and slow down without really realizing it.

Cons:
* Music warm up on the 2 mile walk - It's got a hip hop vibe and repeats 'power power walk power power walk' - at first I really liked it and was energized, but by the end of the 5 minute warm up I was annoyed with it. Eventually it transitions to the music for the walk which didn't annoy me at all. Small annoyance.
* The product pushing - Also a small annoyance - but she heavily pushes her weights and her stretchy band - but you can easily use canned goods for the weights. I get from a marketing perspective why she'd talk so much about her branded products, but it still annoys me.

Overall, I highlight recommend this video if you need a flexible indoor workout for some cardio.",1265932800,5,3014,3.9933665008291874
3852412,5,B00265T7O2,"You may wonder how great of an exercise can you get by walking in front of your TV. Well, I have to say I am really impressed. This is a great workout that is kept interesting and challenging by combining side steps, knee raises, kick backs, and front kicks to work different muscles and get your blood flowing. In addition, toning exercises are incorporated using 1 pound hand weights and a toning band to increase difficulty and improve muscle definition of your upper body. I tend to do 3 or more miles, but I was surprised one day when I had time only to do the one mile. It was fairly intense because the pace and the toning exercises incorporated. It was good enough that I didn't feel cheated out of a workout from an abbreviated session.

The best part -- it is good for a person in any shape because you set your own pace and opt out of the add-on exercises if you are just beginning. Leslie is a great motivator, and she keeps a team of women (and one gentleman) behind her of various fitness levels so you don't feel inadequate.

Overall, I am very impressed and glad I added it to my collection.",1265760000,10,1107,4.342995169082125

Mom's a pretty busy and healthy, 82-year-old, who grumbles about anything that seems too much like exercise. I had to persuade her to do the 1-mile walk. She fought me tooth and nail, then loved doing it. The same thing happened with the 2-mile walk. I've done the 1-, 2-, 3-, and am now on the 4-mile. I can tell you that they are effective and really fun! I had heard about Leslie Sansone for a long time, but I  never realized how good she was until I kept reading about people who lost the pounds doing her workouts. I got this DVD first because it has four workouts on it. I don't need to get anything else, but I know I will because I just really enjoy the workouts with Leslie. We miss it if we don't do it.

Also for people with health problems, not bad on the joints or back and you can adjust your impact and still get a good workout in.  I absolutely love this collection and now can't start or end my days without it.  I am up to the 3 mile walk which is challenging, working my way up to the 4 mile but time is a factor in that one.  Small Downside but can be overlooked: Sometimes she talks a bit too much and you can get distracted and lose the beat. The people in her class are OK but also distracting as they all do the moves differently so I try to just keep my eye on Leslie.  When she says gentle steps, kicks, sidesteps on the warm up/warm down, some of the ""show offs"" in the class are still doing aggressive moves or moving like it's a dance step.  Again, just keep your eye on Leslie. If they have the people with her, they should be more uniform in steps but different in intesity for various situations DVD users may have (Sr. Citizen, Arthritis, Obese etc) I totally dig the Sr. gentleman in the class because he keeps up without missing a beat but I think he should be in front to represent).  Still all in all, it's a fabulous work out, I think Leslie has FANTASTIC spirit and is extremely motivating to me because I totally would have quit by now and I am seeing changes in my body.  I have been alternating back and forth between this DVD and her American Heart Association 2 Mile walk ""On Demand TV"" because they are different moves and the TV version does not use the stretchie band.

We use the walking system together two days a week and it has been fun to work out with friends, but I found myself wanting to do it even more often for better results so I ordered my own copy (which comes with that great stretchy band).  I like that it offers four different workouts so you can mix them up and use them in any way you need.  Having this system has taken out a lot of the excuses I used to have for not exercising.  I can't afford a gym membership and this was a very affordable option.  Plus, I do not have to worry about childcare, the weather, driving anywhere, walking through traffic or encountering aggressive dogs (or people!), etc.  I am a person who also likes routine, so this works just fine for me.  She does mix up the steps enough in the different workouts so your body does not get bored.  She is positive and uplifting and not condemning in any way.  And the different people walking with her are very inspirational as well.  I have been using this program for a month now, and along with making changes in my diet, I have lost 16 lbs.

The problem with the so called 4 mile express isn't really that. What do I mean: right towards the end of mile 3 the speed slows down far too quicly and the 4th mile drags out due to the slow pace. Those of us into real exercising want something that keeps the pace for the full 4 miles so I do the first 3 miles and then I switch to another 4 mile one and do miles 2 &3 as the pace is what I need.,1257638400,11,514,3.7247706422018347
3852435,4,B00265T7O2,"I love Leslie she makes me feel comfortable. She encourages you; never pressures you.
The steps are easy to follow. Iv'e only done the one-mile workout so far and I like it. I have done the two-mile workout on one of her other videos and had no problem
keeping up. It is a great workout without the exhausting jumping and bouncing of
aerobics.",1257552000,4,343,4.4603174603174605
3852436,5,B00265T7O2,"I used to work out. I used to run track.  Then life happened I turned 30, I had a baby, I had a hundred excuses and 40 pounds to loose and found myself so out of shape it hurt when I excercised.  I started with Leslie's 1 mile video that I got in a bargain bin, thinking , walking in place huh, that is easy...and it was as easy as it made me sweat and the time fly, Now that I have used this one for a few days now I love it even more, the music is great, the lighting really wakes you up and as usual it is easy but I sweat the pounds away, 3 weeks and 5.4 pounds gone and counting! I expect that this routine (being more advanced then the 1 mile work out) will really shed these pounds, I already am excited to get up and move! Thanks Leslie!
2013 and yep I lost those 40 lbs and keep them off with Leslie, I do her workout 3 time a week and haven't looked back.",1255910400,22,865,3.773480662983425
3852437,5,B00265T7O2,"I have over 12 Leslie Sansone walk videos and this one is the best.  It offers four workouts that span from 1 - 4 miles.  If you're short on time you can do the 1 or 2 mile walks.  If you want a more intense workout you can do the 3 or 4.  Great for traveling.  All 4 workouts on one disk for easy packing, and the 4 workouts give you variety.",1254787200,,343,3.7083333333333335
3852438,5,B00265T7O2,"This product was recommended to me by a friend and boy was she right!  It is so fun and really easy to follow along throughout the whole workout!  There are no complicated steps or dance moves, and it goes by really fast...before you know it the workout is over!  Even though the program is based on walking in place, it still gives you a really good workout and gets your heart rate up to that cardio level that's good for the calorie burning.  Plus, Leslie Sansone is so darn likeable!  I would definitely recommend this DVD to beginners as well as advanced",1254096000,,559,4.4411764705882355
