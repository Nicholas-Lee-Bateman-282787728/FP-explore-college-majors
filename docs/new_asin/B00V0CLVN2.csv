7076041,1,B00V0CLVN2,"If you have the original 2010 blu-ray versions of Poltergeist II & III, keep them
this Double feature reissue is just both films in 1 case, whether it's 2 films on 1 Disc or 2 Discs with a film each not sure
but same HD transfers same 5.1 Master audio mixes as the 2010 versions
 Just no new extras at all, just theatrical trailers
so the only Difference is Different packaging/Different artwork that's it.
waste of money as far as i'm concerned
if there were new special features added, eg new retrospective featurette with Actors Craig T nelson, Jobeth williams
and other crew members from the film i would give more stars for better blu-ray release
but of course MGM did not bother that's why i gave this new blu-ray only 1 star, typical barebones release.
4 stars for the film Poltergeist II, maybe 3 stars for the 3rd film
only 1 star for this new blu-ray reissue, Disgusting effort by MGM what else is new",1427328000,,911,4.4879518072289155

7076047,4,B00V0CLVN2,"Two sequels to the blockbuster classic Poltergeist here.  While nothing compares to the brilliance of the first film, these two films are still fun fare to have in your collection if you're a big fan of that movie.  Just don't expect something that will blow you away.  The special effects in part two doesn't hold up decades after it came out, but it is still fun to watch nevertheless.  Part two has some definite holes and you'll like my have some criticisms floating around.  Little things are noticeable such as the eldest daughter is completely absent and there's no mention of her.  Of course those that know the back story on the Poltergeist movies, the actress that played the oldest daughter had died months after then first film was in theaters.  There is only one disc in this thing.  One film is on one side, then you have to flip it over if you want to watch the other.  That's a little cheap, but then again I got this for $5 so I'm happy just to have the films for such an incredible steal.  There are also no bonus extras on this, which would've been nice if the makers of this DVD could have put something together about each of the films.

Neither of these films comes close to the classic first film, and in fact each sequel is worse than the previous one.  Poltergeist 3 is just horrible.  Bad script, bad acting, bad everything.  The only returning characters were Carol Anne and the medium Tangina.  Unless they could get the entire original cast they shouldn't have bothered.  I wouldn't have paid more than the $5 I paid for both of these films.  That was worth it just to have the trilogy.  It is somewhat sad to watch the third film as the actress that plays Carol Anne died before the movie came out.  She was apparently going through all sorts of medical issues, one of them being on medication that made her cheeks look puffy as they did in the third film.",1492300800,3,1886,4.446064139941691

It basically picks up right where the first movie ended, with the same cast playing the family we grew familiar with previously.

7076094,4,B00V0CLVN2,"Somewhere along the way, the Freeling family moved and lost a daughter in the process.  They're having trouble with the insurance claim on their missing home and Steve Freeling (Craig T. Nelson) is out of a job.  Since they're almost broke, Diane Freeling (JoBeth Williams) goes shopping with her two remaining children and they meet a very scary and persistent ghost (Julian Beck as Rev. Henry Kane).  They're living with a grandma (Geraldine Fitzgerald) not long for this world.  They have their own personal rain cloud and a room full of menacing toys.  Help comes in the form of Taylor (Will Sampson) and Tangina (Zelda Rubinstein).  Unfortunately, they're not quite as good at their jobs as they claim.  Trouble comes calling.  ""Let me come in.""  And Dad drinks a Mezcal worm and lives to regret it.
The best scene in this retread has the EVIL Rev. Kane on the porch, at the door, entreating the dopey dad to let him in.  And when he doesn't..............""You are going to die in there!""
Mostly a FX feast with a rushed ending.  Craig T. Nelson overacts shamelessly.

For the third entry in this series, poor Carol Anne is dumped on an evil uncaring aunt (Nancy Allen as Pat Gardner).  Carol Anne is forced to attend a twisted school full of twisted teachers and students.  One such teacher (Richard Fire as Dr. Seaton) has convinced himself and others that Carol Anne is a delusional and dangerously manipulative child capable of performing mass hypnosis on everyone she comes in contact with.  He sticks with that theory right up until the moment it stops working for him.
The art direction for this film was easy, they just put mirrors everywhere and played with imagery seen and not seen.  The script was also an easy write; it mainly consists of everyone saying ""Carol Anne"" a b-zillion times in succession!
It is undistinguished, more horrible than horror.  The plot is disjointed and nonsensical.

The original movie is a complete classic and no sequels really needed to be made but you know the 80's and the way they used to like churning out the sequels, poltergeist 2 is no where near as good as the original but it is still a great fun 80's horror with minor scares, the effects still look cool and there are some good practical scary effects etc, the credit is mainly due to the great cast from the original all returning to play their roles again as the family having to protect their daughter Carol Anne played by the talented Heather O Rourke who sadly passed after filming the third poltergeist movie (which was a better sequel) this sequel adds many new things to the mix and gets a bit messy and wasn't really well thought out but its still a fun 80's movie and has all the classic formula, check it out of course if your a fan of the series, its still better than the remake (2015)

Blu-ray picture looks good, a little grainy in places but still better than DVD
86-mins, 1986.

POLTERGEIST 3
This third instalment is not as good as the original yet again but is a great horror movie with a better budget than the second one and a more fun story, the third has more freakier moments due the effects being better this time around with some cool looking practical corpses and scary effects etc, this time we see a different cast, Heather O'Rourke plays Carol Anne yet again in her last movie performance and a great one it is too as she was really getting into this character so much more, Nancy Allen (Robocop) and Tom Skerritt (Alien) both appear as Carol Anne's aunt and uncle whom she is staying with at the time the spirits find her yet again and try to take her back to the other side! if your a fan then certainly check this out, great story and cool 80's effects, not as cult classic as the original but still good fun.

7076118,2,B00V0CLVN2,"Rather tragically, after the pathetic hijacking of the original film's title for the ""Insidious""-like movie entitled ""Poltergeist"" that came out summer of 2015, these two sequels have been repackaged yet again but without any extra content at all (with the blaring exception of two rather silly trailers) and without much improvement in terms of picture and sound. However, maybe the new Blu-Ray sets at least LOOK better...so if you are going to spring for these two sequels, I say go for the Blu-Rays (if you have a Blu-Ray player)...I saw both at Best Buy recently, and not only do you get more packaging but you also will probably get a better presentation overall. Below are my reviews of the two movies that are packaged here:
""POLTERGEIST 2: THE OTHER SIDE"" (1986, MGM)
Oh boy. So apparently, the Grais-Victor team returned for this alleged sequel (this writing team has since parted ways but, since I can note films like ""Death Hunt,"" ""Marked for Death,"" and ""Poltergeist"" as being products of their writing hands, I think this is rather sad) to the Spielberg-directed original (c'mon, you know it's true), but this time the story is a complete bust. (Ken Russell should have directed this film, not Brian Gibson!). I think Grais-Victor certainly understand genre cinema, but there is one thing very glaringly wrong with it--IT ISN'T REMOTELY SCARY IN ANY WAY! Not that I enjoy being terrified all the time, but the terror and intensity of the Spielberg original got away, and it has been replaced by a creature feature fun house movie that features way too many special effects wrapped around a rather incomplete (and incompetent) story. I really don't know what the point of this movie is. I can only hope that the executives approached Grais and Victor first and that things didn't happen the other way around. In fact, the picture opens like a cross between ""The Trial of Billy Jack"" and ""Altered States,"" and certainly has nothing to do with ""Poltergeist"". The film uses the frame tale of a diabolical cult leader leading his flock to the desert for a suicide cult thing (a charming reference to the Jonestown travesty, I suspect), and it is the figure known as Kane who we eventually learn is the Beast (but we all know that the real beast is the one who approved this idiotic screenplay). The movie is simply ruined by too many special effects. Spielberg's original was a light and sound show with an involving sense of emotion about it; here, we are watching a parade of monsters and weird images that are anything but truly frightening. The tale weaves in some of the Native American mythos into its mix, but sometimes it's better to not tell us everything about a mystery (actually, some of H. R. Giger's monster concepts are good, but his anxiety about going to the set really did hamper their operation on screen, and as a result the picture looks a lot more comical than it should...the abandoned 3-D idea didn't help, as sequences of flying chainsaws and ghostly reflections would have been a lot more shocking in that context than they are in 2-D, but really these effects are not unsettling in the slightest). Williams and Nelson appear to be acting in some of sort of situation comedy, and have none of the blas&eacute; effectiveness that was so evident in the original picture. O'Rourke is still a beautiful young lady here and she is obviously amongst the most talented involved--but her tragic death not that many years later cut short what might have been a promising career in film. Although it is nice to Rubinstein back on board, her character is given so little to do. The motivation for the story this time is rather pointless. I suppose some of this could have been creepy, but the music score (by Goldsmith) is far lighter, and the producers obviously had a lot of ideas that they had no control over, and therefore the picture runs out of steam way too early on.
At the very least, the project gave James Kahn a chance to write a novelization of the script, one I'm sure is more frightening and more interesting than this whole misguided affair.

""POLTERGEIST 3"" (1988; MGM)
Well, I will be honest and admit that I dozed off about twenty minutes into this one. All you have to do is go onto Siskel and Ebert's website and watch the review for this one to find out what it's about. I'm all about giving movies a fair shake (especially neglected B-movies and genre pictures that are not fit for mainstream consumption) but I'm very sad to report that the critics were correct about this one. As lovely as Nancy Allen may look, as good as an actor that Tom Skeritt can be under the right circumstances, as lovely and as involved as O'Rourke remained at this time, and even as committed as Rubinstein was to the project all the way through, I still cannot help reporting that this (unnecessary) third installment by the embarrassing Gary Sherman is a total bore. Part two was a scare fest compared to this one! Which is tragic, because the poster looks eerie, the concept is not ludicrous in itself, and it does feel like a Carol Anne movie...but Clive Barker should have made this one, NOT Gary Sherman! I expected a frightening, engrossing paranormal thriller. What I got instead was ""Poltergeist 3."" Terror Tower this is not. Opening in January of 1988, this third movie didn't do quite so well as the others. Why? Because by this point the mystery was gone. That was what made the Spielberg film so scary. Once the writers put a name and a face on the Beast, it spoiled it all for me. But the third film is far too boring to be considered good for even cheap laughs. Stick with the original film by Spielberg or suffer the consequences. The Beast has spoken.

Overall rating: D+ (the plus is because I'm glad to see that these older sequels are being reissued...but in this case, that's not saying very much)",1437350400,,5845,4.690360272638753

7076123,3,B00V0CLVN2,Poltergeist II is a little bit weird and typical 80's flare. Poltergeist III is better in my opinion than II. But the original just can't be beat. The one good thing that all three movies have is actress Heather O'Rourke ( Carol Ann ) If not for her I would say don't waste your time or money. But that's just my opinion.  I have always been partial to her as a child actress.,1435968000,6,376,4.1506849315068495
