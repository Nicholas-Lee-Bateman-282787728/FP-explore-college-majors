5012152,5,B006PA0TRI,"I will keep this short.  I am a professional, college educated woman in my 30s from the southeastern United States and I am PROUD to say I am a fan of anything John Wayne has done in film.  I love his one hour flicks from the 30s where he took a running leap up into the saddle and I loved his drunken stair climb with Maureen O'sullivan in MCLINTOCK!  The man was a master!  There is not one actor alive today (except maybe James Caan) who can hold a candle to the Duke.",1345680000,3,471,4.032258064516129
5012153,5,B006PA0TRI,"Let's face it. John Wayne was John Wayne. With very few exceptions (THE SEARCHERS being one of them), Wayne didn't play a character... he played himself. But even the best of these is worth watching and these three movies are not only the best of those but in superb picture quality. The bonus extras are skimmed but there's at least something to enjoy. Originally these films were released on DVD as singles for a higher price than Amazon is selling now so grab all three movies (this is a three-disc set) and you'll thank me for it.",1345420800,14,534,4.515463917525773
5012154,5,B006PA0TRI,What do you say about an Icon. John Wayne is always entertaining to me even if the movie is soso.,1336003200,2,97,3.9
5012155,5,B006PA0TRI,"In the Shootist, John Wayne is really believable as the worn out cowboy. I think Lauren Bacall is beautiful. The scenes seem to flow with the good acting.
I fell asleep for the other two movies. I'd seen part of Liberty Valance before but did not like the confusing structure of it. The premise I read of Katie Elder sounded interesting.",1333670400,,337,4.540983606557377

5012159,1,B006PA0TRI,"I purchased this for my John Wayne collection in January of this year(2015) I opened it up and started to watch it and about 100 minutes into the movie, it stopped and wouldn't finish. I tried to contact Amazon for a replacement and was not able to access their return or replacement area. I tried many times. Now I am stuck with a DVD that won't work. Don't know how to contact them. Very upset with their return/replacement area. I order a lot of stuff from Amazon. This isn't first time I have tried to replace a problem.
Very upset,

5012163,5,B006PA0TRI,"Of the three, ""Sons of Katie Elder"" should be replaced with ""Rio Lobo"" to make this triad a truly great package. As for supporting actors, Edmund Obrien's portrayal of Dutton Peabody is the clear definition of spectacular talent. In my small opinion, the best acting in the whole movie ... sammy",1404777600,,295,4.803921568627451

5012165,5,B006PA0TRI,"THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE-- John Wayne, a local rancher, Jimmy Stewart a mild mannered lawyer, Andy Devine, the scarey Sheriff ""I use that term lighty"",  and Lee Marvin, who played the part of the mean gunslinger bully Liberty Valance.  ""A Great Flick""

SONS OF KATIE ELDER-- Who Died and her four sons came to pay their last respects at the funeral.  John Wayne, the oldest and toughest,  Dean Martin who was a gambler who was also good with a gun, Carl Helliman who was the quiet one, no-one ever called him yellow, twice, and the youngest, Michael Anderson, any hope for respectability, lies with him. A real nice action  story...

THE SHOOTIST--John Wayne [J C Books Famed Gunslinger], Jimmy Stewart [Doctor and friend], Lauren Bacall who rents a room to Books, ,and Ron Howard as Becall's teenager son Gillian.  JC Books was diagnosed with cancer and has a short time to live and just wants to end his life quietly without anyone knowing who he is. However it is not Books's  fate to die in peace but gets embroiled in a violent gun battle. I believe this was Waynes last movie due to his failing health. Yhis was a heartfelt movie Iam sure you will like it as I did.",1402704000,,1179,4.523584905660377
5012166,1,B006PA0TRI,The 3-Pack DVD had to be returned as Defective. I could not watch the DVDs because they were skipping on three different DVD players.  The Video could not keep up with the audio. It was tested on two different models of a PC and on an external HP LightScribe DVD player and all of them produced the same problem where other DVDs played just fine.,1394755200,,346,4.323076923076923

5012168,5,B006PA0TRI,"I bought this for The Man who shot Liberty Valance, as I believe it to be Wayne's best western, and this 3 pack is the only way currently to purchase it. The Sons of Katie Elder is not as strong of a movie but is entertaining, and The Shootist is Wayne's last film. It is a very good movie, and seeing Duke with Jimmy Stewart again was great. We will never see the likes of these men in our lifetimes. They were the bedrock of American cinema in the 20th century.",1391385600,,463,4.0989010989010985

5012173,4,B006PA0TRI,"Only drawback is that one of films is not in color - surprised that someone has not remastered with color.  After all, we do not image objects in black and white.",1374451200,,162,4.225806451612903
5012174,5,B006PA0TRI,"These are the quintessential movies Wayne made in his later years. They are quite simply three of his best movies, especially Liberty Valance and The Shootist. I have watched all three several times, and even have got family members to watch. Great stories that tell the tales of much more than shoot-outs, focusing on the changing west. Lee Marvin is just a fabulous evil bad guy, and Wayne, Stewart, and a cavalcade of STARS round out the entertainment. The black and white Liberty Valance is crisp and clear, and the recreation of Carson City in the Shootist are highlights I enjoy each time I view them.",1371081600,,607,4.735849056603773
5012175,3,B006PA0TRI,"Hey I really like John Wayne movies.  Yes he made a lot of them and alot were pretty bad.  In this series only one stands out ""The Man who Shot Liberty Valance""  I liked it as if you have to have a melodrama why not add John Wayne into it.  There is Lee Marvin (bad guy), Jimmy Steward (good guy nerd) and John (semi-bad with heart of gold).  Shot in B&W so all it all not bad if you don't worry about great acting.  The other two must have been made for ""Straight to video"" Sons of Katie Elder added a lot of name stars and the acting was horrible.  The Shootist was I think was John's last movie.  It was suppose to protrey him as a dying old gunfigther who wants to die sooner rather than die of old age, etc.",1368576000,,712,3.964788732394366
5012176,5,B006PA0TRI,"And fan of John Wayne should definitely own these three movies.  His last film, The Shootist is an excellent film and the perfect movie for The Duke to end his career on.  Jimmy Stewart is great as his doctor and The Man who Shot Liberty Valance displays the great acting skills of both men.  And The Sons of Katie Elder is another great John Wayne/Dean Martin western.  A must own!",1368230400,,382,4.414285714285715
5012177,4,B006PA0TRI,The movie showed up in excellent condition and really enjoyed sharing this great film by the Duke with my boys.,1366588800,,111,4.6
5012178,3,B006PA0TRI,I bought these movies for the family to watch. The second movie locked up several times. I hit the fast forward and play each time and was able to see the movie to the end. I threw the last movie away because it was full of cussing from the start to the finish. It seemed the actors would cuss for no reason. The boy in the movie cussed as bad and the adults.,1366156800,,359,3.9315068493150687

5012195,1,B006PA0TRI,"I hate John Wayne and only ordered this because my wife wanted to see it. It came quickly and in excellent condition. Wayne named names during the Hollywood witch hunts. A poor thing for a supposed artist to do. I can only guess the FBI had something on him that threatened his career, maybe his real life didn't match his macho movie image. He couldn't act, anyway, and only got his Oscar out of pity. So, that's why I hate John Wayne.",1350172800,,436,4.329268292682927

8502665,5,B006PA0TRI,"Three of the best John Wayne movies ever done, including the Shootist, that I believe was the best John Wayne movie EVER. He really clicked with the main character, an older gunfighter dying of cancer, and I would love to know if Wayne knew that HE was dying at the time the film was made. I will guess that he did, as the portrayal of the character was spot on. Liberty Valance was one of the better western type movies of the time, and Sons of Katie Elder was a well plotted story as well. John Wayne at his best, in three of his best movies, what's not tow like?",1491782400,,565,4.1454545454545455

8502670,4,B006PA0TRI,"Two very good films and one that was kind of a waste of time.  The Shootist is one of the more thoughtful films that John Wayne ever did with solid performances all around and a very good script.  Lauren Bacall is fantastic as the reluctant landlady to John Wayne notorious gunfighter border.  Ron Howard turns in a fine adult performance and all of the supporting cast is spot on.
Liberty Valance is one of the best modern westerns of that era with Jimmy Stewart as the naive lawyer new to the west who has to come to terms with Lee Marvin as Liberty Valance who is a really nasty man with no redeeming qualities, a part that few could do as much justice too as Marvin. John Wayne is the good tough guy and even though he loses the girl in the end, he is still a hero.  So many subtle bits throughout this film that you may need to watch it twice. Great supporting cast also.
Katie Elder is formulaic and boring typical so many Wayne westerns during this time.",1449100800,,961,4.292817679558011
