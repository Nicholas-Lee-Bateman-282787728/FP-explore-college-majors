7743850,5,B01F5X9WVE,A wonderful and magical experience to watch this film- the director enjoys a special relationship with the Dalai Lama because the Dalai Lama really opens up. We all can learn something from watching this- and from each other. This film is extraordinary.,1468022400,7,253,5.0476190476190474
7743851,5,B01F5X9WVE,"Loved this film. Very inspiring and well directed. Photography is great and loved the story line. Entertaining, spiritual, brilliant. Highly recommend this film",1467936000,2,160,6.0
7743852,4,B01F5X9WVE,Enjoyed it.  Even the negative visiting westerners seemed to evolve to be more understanding and better people from their interactions with the Dalai Lama ( who expressed who he is in humility and what he teaches with simplicity and emphasizing it's importance in today's world.),1490486400,,279,5.2
7743853,2,B01F5X9WVE,"Even though I am aware almost everything that's marketed on FB (where I saw this video's trailer) is NOT what potential buyers think it is I still purchased this video. I could not image that anybody would have the audacity trying to sell a failure of epic proportions and use the Dalai Lama and Harrison Ford to ""sell"" this failure.
*
This video should be titled, ""How 40 leading innovative Western thinkers learned a lesson from a humble Buddhist monk, the Dalai Lama.""
*
Here what's wrong with the marketing: For starters, I could not find out in what year this ""meeting with the Dalai Lama""-event took place. Since Wayne Teasdale died in 2004 it seems that the words ""over a 15 year period"" refer to that the meeting took place in 2001.
Why does this matter? Well, when 40 leading innovative Western thinkers set out to meet with the Dalai Lama and CHANGE THE WORLD, you'd hope that something happened since the meeting took place.
(quote) ""... The new film was born from over 500 hours of video footage that was shot by 10 cinematographers over a 15 year period...""
Watching the video it becomes painfully obvious that it took fifteen years to construct ""any kind of movie"" from the material shot at the conference because there wasn't any breakthrough that could have been shown right after the meeting took place.
The video includes unneeded filler material like few videos I have watched. Historic footage from the Dalai Lama's escape in 1953, which is not needed (there are about a dozen excellent videos on Youtube everybody can watch). Additionally, scenic footage from India and all kinds of dancers and musicians have been added to this video. I think I speak for every viewer when I say that when buying a video about the Dalai Lama, I am not looking for at least 15 minutes of footage of Indian dancers and 'sights and sounds' of India.
*
To understand how ridiculous the 40 leading innovative Western thinkers' attempt to 'change the world' is you have to go no further than segment ""Day 1.""
More than one of the leading innovative Western thinkers complain about the travel conditions from the airport to Dharamsala, home to the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile.

Stunningly arrogant, apparently, these leading innovative Western thinkers don't realize that if they really want to change the world, whatever bothers them about poverty in India, road conditions et al. becomes their problem, too.
*
These 40 are truly completely disconnected from real life. Later on, one of them says something to the extent of, ""... coming from America we thought we'd meet in this spiritual atmosphere and by Day 4 we have a plan...""
Huh? ... Total disconnect with the real world!
*
[Also, myself having traveled India including the Zanskar and Ladakh region for five weeks, I can vouch for that these forty people rode on a luxury bus. Personally, I have experienced  worse conditions.]
*
After they finally arrive, days and days of bickering follow, with the depicted leading innovative Western thinkers trying to prove to each other that their concept of synthesis is a better one than their fellow thinker's.
*
This was so painful and so annoying that I turned off the video.
*
To me these people seems to be so self absorbed that they won't even accept what's there for everybody to experience. From personal experience I know that openness is all that's needed to ""receive.""
Being Austrian I met in person Heinrich Harrer, the teacher of the young Dalai Lama in 1974 or '75. He told 13-year old me that if I wanted to see the real Tibet I should hurry up ""because the Chinese will destroy Tibet."" Barely a decade later I made it. In January 1987 so few tourists visited Lhasa, Tibet that I could meditate in the Dalai Lama's former bedroom alone by myself for half an hour.

Having ""been there"" I know what I experienced, and apparently, it's not what these ""40"" allowed themselves to experience. It is the peaceful atmosphere, the peace the monks radiate, the being closer to the skies that seekers crave and what changes them.

Realizing that all of us are only tiny specs in the big setting of the universe.

If people allow this spiritual feeling to happen it is so powerful that it even changes people who did not set out to experience it (like me).
*
Watching the movie it seems that quite many of the 40 leading innovative Western thinkers aren't open to receive ""whatever"" they would receive (like I was in 1987), they seem to be out to use the Dalai Lama as a star power to market their concept, and each one wants to be the star ""next to the Dalai Lama.""
*
Just like they ignored the poverty they saw when traveling to Dharamsala they ignore the implications of their almost silly economic plans.
*
Still, when I finished watching the video the next day at first I was ready to modify my 1-star ranking to a 3-star score because I hoped that the ""humble monk Dalai Lama's"" efforts to explain that bringing change is about happiness and peace, that achieving this goal has a long term component and that we are suffering because of the mistakes people made in the last century helped the 40 to change their attempt and efforts.

Then I did some more research.
1. I could not find any combined efforts of the group of 40.
2. Elisabet Sahtouris' name is misspelled on the titles. (Really?)
3. Worst of all: On his website, Myron Kellner-Rogers has 8 webpages about the film, including a video of the Dalai Lama shaking his hand, yet the page  ""Community/Discussions Dalai Lama"" leads to a page: ""04 not found-the resource requested could not be found on this server..."" I appears for Myron Kellner-Rogers the meeting's final result was to market meeting the Dalai Lama for his personal benefit.
*
Also misleading: Harrison Ford does not narrate the movie, he recites a few quotes. To me that's just another attempt to use Harrison Ford's star power to market a failed quest. That's the opposite of ""changing the world;"" it's ""changing things for ME.""
*
Summing it up: If you are looking for content: ""The Dalai Lama Teaching Leading Innovative Western Thinkers a Lesson"" watch this video; otherwise skip it; you'll probably regret the purchase like I did.

7743854,2,B01F5X9WVE,"This is a movie about how not to run a conference, not about the Dalai Lama.  The vast majority of the film merely describes the problems the organizers had in getting people to agree to the format of the conference.  It had almost nothing to do with the discussion of any significant issues, and the Dalai Lama appears only briefly.  I was highly disappointed!",1489708800,3,361,4.609375
7743855,3,B01F5X9WVE,"I was disappointed I'm afraid.  I thought it was about awakening in myself ... but to watch this group of people was not really what I had in mind.  Not only that but there seemed to be a lot of egos around, quite the reverse of what Buddhism is, or so I thought!",1489622400,3,263,3.943396226415094
7743856,5,B01F5X9WVE,"If your heart is at least as open as the film's participants, then you will benefit. They were a group of brainiacs, mainly elite scientists and intellectuals. Surprise: many of them experienced an ""Aha!"" moment of spiritual transformation by no later than their last day in Dharamsala (during the Q&A session). Included was a Jesuit who earlier had expressed some doubts. This can be attributed to the Dalai Lama's elegant simplicity, a spark of spiritual genius that allows him to teach effectively across religious and cultural divides. Watch and experience this for yourself.",1489363200,,579,5.236559139784946
7743857,3,B01F5X9WVE,"This video spent  more time on the people who attended the meeting, than on the Dalai Lama. I imagine that they were only allowed a certain amount of time with him, so they probably had no choice. But I am more interested in him than them, so I was a little disappointed, although what I saw of the Dalai Lama was wonderful!!! And a few of the people who were there, seemed to have learned a very important life lesson by the end of their time in Tibet - which was touching enough to make me cry. Yeah, I'm a softie. The Dalai Lama did not disappoint - he made the video worth buying.",1489363200,,584,4.12280701754386
7743858,1,B01F5X9WVE,"Very disappointing.  My wife and i, both very passionate admirers of HH The Dalai Lama, had hoped this film would have centered more around him and his vast pool of wisdom.  Instead, it's basically about a bunch of cranky wizards of smart, trying to outdo one another in their egregious displays of hubris.  If you want that, just watch any given news show with people constantly talking over each other.  We'll stick to his books and other videos.",1488412800,,448,4.705128205128205
7743859,5,B01F5X9WVE,"This documentary by Krachyar Darvich ""DALAI LAMA AWAKENING""  truly IS an awakening.
It's about an inspiring and empowering journey of several of the world's greatest thinkers coming together to meet with the Dalai Lama, seeking to find answers to the world's problems.
What they experienced was a transformation and a connection to the deepest places within themselves.  This is an incredible body of work, and beautiful reminder that remaining open to all possibilities can be life changing.  Thank you Krachyar Darvich for this inspiring film.",1487980800,,545,5.3882352941176475
7743860,1,B01F5X9WVE,"I was excited to see this movie. I love H.H. Dalai Lama. I was looking forward to a movie that I could treasure and watch repeatedly. But this movie was mostly just a bunch of entitled and self-indulgent jabbering about nothing while believing that they're saying something profound. The only scenes of value were those of the Dalai Lama speaking, but they were few and far between. Also, ""narrated by Harrison Ford"" is an exaggeration at best. He narrates a very little bit, and he sounds like he's as bored with the movie as I was. Save your money and read one of the Dalai Lama's books instead.",1487376000,3,597,4.537037037037037
7743861,5,B01F5X9WVE,"An excellent movie with a timely and important message!! I was a bit frustrated with ""the team"" but in the end, my heart was so filled with Joyfulness!! The ""message"" validated my truth and brought me happy tears of Hope! I purchased this movie with the intention of sharing it with my family. I will continue spreading the message of Love ",1487376000,4,340,4.573770491803279
7743862,5,B01F5X9WVE,"The film begins with the the most respected minds from a variety of disciplines gathering in Dharmsala, India to meet the Dalai Lama in Tibet.  They have gathered in an attempt to form a synthesis of ideas from the variety of disciplines to produce a cohesive plan which would benefit humanity most.  The plan would then be discussed with the Dalai Lama in a two hour period.  The struggles of forming a synthesis of ideas becomes obvious from the beginning as the individual contributors struggle with their egos to form a synthesis.  By the time the group is ready for a question and answer period with the Dalai Lama, members of the group are still arguing over who gets to ask the Dalai Lama questions in the two hour question and answer period.

I found the best part of the film to be the question and answer period as the Dalai Lama fields a variety of questions leading the group to reflect deeper on the synthesis they are attempting to create.  After meeting the Dalai Lama, it becomes clear how each of these great minds was profoundly effected by the Dalai Lama's answers.

Definitely a film worth watching.",1486425600,2,1119,4.621212121212121
7743863,5,B01F5X9WVE,I love this movie documentary. Was really great to see great minds get together and find that they actually have ego I also like the fact that we need to look within ourselves to create the answers that we need to help others. Yes we all need compassion  And we all need to be humble and help one another.

7743871,2,B01F5X9WVE,"Have to agree with some others that have posted disappointment. We love all things Dalai Lama, but this film was more about the personalities bickering over the set up pf the event, than any meaningful dialogue. We were very surprised to not enjoy a film about the Dalai Lama. Harrison Ford lent his name and a few lines of narration, that's about it for him.
If you're collecting film about the Dalai Lama, then perhaps you would want it for your library, otherwise there are better films available.
Just our opinion of this film, we love the Dalai Lama!",1483660800,,555,4.616161616161616
7743872,2,B01F5X9WVE,"This is more a travelogue focused on the personalities of the tour group that is featured than a presentation of the Dalai Lama's wisdom.  The Dalai Lama himself was very secondary, not central enough to give the film any substance. Pretty cinematography, but weak content that has little to do with HHDL, more an exploration of the tangential opinions, attitudes, personal tensions, and stories of western ""thought leaders"" who took this trip.",1482451200,2,444,5.166666666666667

7743876,2,B01F5X9WVE,"Whenever you get a group of people together, there's always one or two who take over the conversation; so I wasn't surprised when I viewed this video to find two individuals of the group showing themselves up to being complete ego-maniacs in their attempt to get 'their' point only, across to the others.

 I once heard a Native American healer say  :  ""In order to heal, I simply get out of the way"".  The group depicted in AWAKENING needs to meditate on that phrase.",1476057600,5,468,4.523809523809524

7743878,2,B01F5X9WVE,"For the first time, I was disappointed in something featuring the Dalai Lama.  I have not only enjoyed his books and speeches for years, but been very inspired by them.  He and Buddhism, as well as regular daily meditation, changed my life for the better years ago.  This video, however, was more of a travelogue featuring a group of followers, their thoughts, words, actions, and interactions, which were not that interesting or pleasant. At times, they seemed like a bunch of day dreamers and idol worshippers who treated the Dalai Lama more like a rock star or celebrity than a spiritual guide.  I did enjoy the parts of the film that featured the Dalai Lama speaking, but they were to few.  Instead of this video, I would recommend one of his books, especially ""Ethics for a New Millennium"", or the excellent audio edition, read by B. D. Wong.",1475020800,13,847,4.695945945945946

The film really hits home as we journey to India with Harrison Ford and the Dalai Lama and learn that before we can change the world we have to confront our own egos. While this film could have easily been just another ""bio-pic"" on the Dalai Lama mixed in with broad spiritual advice it instead transcends all that and marches to it's own beat.

7743894,5,B01F5X9WVE,"The documentary film Dalai Lama Awakening is a journey worth taking for anyone who finds himself or herself on a spiritual path guided by the insights of Tibetan Buddhism and the Dalai Lama.

It presents beautiful images of India and the Tibetan settlement in India, where the Dalai Lama has been exiled since the Chinese invaded Tibet in 1950. Shots of the area filmed by several cinematographers over a 15-year period give depth and scope to the environment and aspects of Tibetan culture. Intimate photography and archival footage help to establish the location and history of the Dalai Lama since coming to India.

The narration by Harrison Ford is limited, and combined with first person interviews, conference conversation, events and talks by the Dalai Lama providing the bulk of the narrative. This documentary is well-edited and offers an experience that feels like actuality rather than a scripted or contrived story. Actuality is not always entertaining in a theatrical way. It derives its value from being as close to the truth of the moment as possible without altering events to create drama or conflict. The conflict observed at the Synergy Conference appears to be very real and human. Some egos flared, but the Dalai Lama is able to set some people on the path of no self, considering compassion, beginning with one's own thoughts, as tools to help humanity.

Dalai Lama Awakening is a thought-provoking documentary and if seen by interested groups, one that should create more discussion that leads to moments of personal transformation.

This is a profound, unique and intensely riveting account of the life-changing journeys of the participants and how the event unfolds. The main theme of this epic meeting was what they called ""synthesis"" ( The combination of thesis and antithesis in the Hegelian dialectical process whereby a new and higher level of truth is produced.) What transpired was nothing short of an epic meeting of great minds and a personal enlightening experience for myself and family who viewed this film.

Great idea, but I'd love to see the same concept undertaken with a group of spiritual visionaries as I think a whole lot more might get accomplished.",1498867200,,436,5.2
8760224,2,B01F5X9WVE,"First off, I just want to say I've read a number of books about the Dalai Lama and meditation, buddhist thought, etc. I really wanted to like this film, but it turned out to be quite boring. Almost a reality TV show feel with much of it being about some of the characters at the conference disagreeing with each other due to strong egos. Just not enough good content for me, so I was disappointed.",1496793600,,397,4.306666666666667
