6106453,5,B00GS8KRVA,"Our children have asked for this DVD over and over again. Even our 2 year old has been repeating the verses on her own. This is an exciting, but not overly flashy video that sets a great example for little ones. Highly recommended.",1389312000,6,231,4.395348837209302
6106454,5,B00GS8KRVA,"I bought this thinking it would be a great way to teach scripture to my children and keep them ""amused"" while I cook dinner. It is very well done and has far exceeded my expectations. The film uses nice scenes and wholesome home life to relay the  scripture (with a few acted out scenes from the Bible.) Most of the film is set to music (instrumental). I believe it is all KJV, but I have not looked up each verse to check.",1389052800,3,423,4.158536585365853

We were incredibly delighted when we discovered this DVD which uses the only translation we trust. This film has helped provide a variety of ideas about the many practical ways we can make scripture come alive to them. And this DVD is proof that although the Bible teaches us to study to show ourselves approved and to love the Lord our God with all our mind, that despite the multitude of arguments against the KJV, the truth is that the KJV is really simple enough that even a child can understand, memorize, quote, and apply it.

We don't have a television in our home, so screen time is a real treat. Now we have finally found a DVD we don't mind them watching over and over again, and they eagerly request to watch this one multiple times a day. My only contention, (and I do realize this is centered around the family who made it so it makes complete sense from that standpoint) is that it would be nice to see more racial diversity in some of the scenes--such as when the brethren are assembling. Since the gospel transcends race, it would be beneficial for young viewers to see a variety of folks worshipping the Lord together. Nevertheless, the DVD has infinitely exceeded our expectations.

Both my husband and I enjoy watching it with our children, and we're even convicted (as adults) by a few of the scenes. The word of the Lord is what convicts, but the way they chose to present the scripture was a gentle rebuke, exhortation, and admonishment to our hearts as well.

It has been overwhelmingly delightful to hear our daughters 3 and 1/2 and 2 years old quoting scripture, including the references! Just yesterday morning they were squabbling over a snack. My 2 year old who tends to have a fiery temperament had a change of heart and decided to share her snack because she wanted to ""Be ye kind one to another."" My heart swelled. This morning my 2 year old also tattled on her big sister for having accidentally spilled a couple of drops of her smoothie on the kitchen table. I was able to remind her of the scene where they present the scripture about not loving in word or in tongue but in deed and in truth. She just turned two two weeks ago, and she immediately understood and grabbed a towel and sweetly wiped up her big sister's mess. It was such a precious moment.

I couldn't be more thrilled with the scriptures, the script, the acting, the behind the scenes shots, the music chosen, the production, creativity, etc. I took media production courses in high school, and was still very impressed with every aspect of the the quality and skill. You can tell they put a tremendous amount of labor and love into every detail.

This is a movie that should be in every young Christian family's home. And I will be sure to promote it to all of my believing friends with young children and grandchildren.

I'm including a clip of my 3 and 1/2 year old daughter who I caught spontaneously quoting one of the verses from the film. The joy and enthusiasm she's been exhibiting is priceless. Trust me when I say it will be worth every cent when you witness your children rejoicing over the word of God.

I truly hope the family will continue making more very similar scipture memory DVDs for children and families! It's obvious they did this to promote the gospel and to help others for the glory of God, rather than investing all their time and effort for selfish gain and royalties. It likely cost more to produce, from a time and monetary standpoint, than any return they may have gained. I pray that the Lord will reward them for their service to His kingdom.",1496793600,3,4166,4.959885386819484

6106457,5,B00GS8KRVA,Amazing and encouraging. My 4 and 2 year old love it. The Gospel is shared at the end and I love how it teaches children Bible verses and shows them how to apply them in real life.,1488499200,,180,3.891891891891892
6106458,5,B00GS8KRVA,"I will admit, when I first saw this, I was skeptical about the quality of the acting, etc. We wanted something for our 18 m.o. to watch on a long car trip. I purchased this, feeling confident that it would be wholesome at least! We were very happily surprised at how beautiful this film is. Our little girl watches it over and over. She can say most of the verses, and sings ""Nothing But The Blood"" as they do in the film. We have been so grateful for the beautiful lessons taught by this video. We know it has impacted our little one forever! We are so blessed to have this family as part of our daughter's life through this video. Very highly recommend!! It will bless your home and family!",1481414400,2,692,4.290076335877862

6106460,5,B00GS8KRVA,"Our 7 year old fell in love with this DVD.  We insist on only Bible based anything on all of our home screens (TV, phones, computer, etc.) on Sundays, and she loved this one so much that she was wanting to watch it throughout the week (over and over, actually), and has memorized several verses from it that she had not previously memorized. Very well done and worth every penny!",1475020800,3,379,4.414285714285715
6106461,5,B00GS8KRVA,"A favourite with our children - all of them, ages 1 to 12 years.  This is a wonderful way to surround them with scripture for their hearts.

The older children like seeing how far they can get memorising them - and practising an American accent too.

Very professional, excellent quality, a great asset for all Christian homes.",1472688000,3,327,4.701754385964913
6106462,5,B00GS8KRVA,My 4-year old granddaughter loves for us to watch it together.,1470873600,,62,4.7272727272727275
6106463,5,B00GS8KRVA,"A-B-C Say  it  With  Me  Bible  Memory  Verses  is such  a  cute  film. My  children adored  it!  Its  about  an hour long. The  film  goes  through  the  alphabet  giving  a  bible  verse  for each  letter  with  a skit  to  show  the meaning. For  example, the  letter  A stands  for,  All  we  like  sheep have  gone  astray,  Isaiah  53:6.  They then show  a boy  climbing  down a  hill after  a  lost  lamb.  The  boy  catches the  lamb  and  returns it  to  the flock. Its  a  way  to  reinforce  the bible  verse  and  to  make  it  come  alive  for little  children.  Now  I  am  a  firm believer that the word of God is ENOUGH. However, there is nothing wrong with visual reminders.

The film  was  beautifully  shot  by  the  Moore  family. Their farm  and  home  is so  homey. Really  there  is no other  word  to  describe  it.  Their place  is  just  one  of  those  places  that  if you  were  to  go  you  wouldnt want to  leave. It  is  beautiful.  There  are  shots  of  horses, sheep, baby  birds,  etc.

  Throughout  the  film  you  can  see  the  love  the  family  has for each other.  We  watched the  behind  scenes  as well  and  the  love  is  definitely  real,  not  just  show.  The  family  stands  out. Seriously  they  stand  out  in  a good  way. I  admire  them.  The  ladies are  all  modestly  dressed.  My  daughters  and  I  were  awing  over some  of the  ladies  outfits. I  was  even telling  my  husband  about  it. He,  unfortunately, did  not  get  the pleasure  of watching  the  film  with us.  Yet. The  Moore  family  is  quite  large  too  which  also  makes  them stand  out.

  My children really  didn't  like  to  see  the  film  end. They  were  encouraged by  the  Moore  family.  At  one point  in  the  film  the  mother comes out  and  sees  some  of her  children  watching  a  Crowes Nest  video surrounded by  lots  of  toys.  She  tells  them  to  pick  up the mess.  The children  are  heard  saying  Philippians 2:14, Do  all things without  murmurings  and  disputings.  The  children clean  the room,  mom  comes  in,  and  they  all celebrate  by  hugging. How  sweet. My  children  have  actually  been quoting  that  verse  when I tell them  to pick up!!! Oh  how  it  blesses this  mother to  hear her  children quoting  Scripture  to  get  through  a  task. The word  of God  is  living  and  powerful!  At another  point  in  the  film  it  shows  some  children writing  Scripture  on  paper. One  of  the  girls  later hands one  to  her  harried  waiter. Its  a  sweet  moment  of a  child  fulfilling  the  Great  Commission. Just acting  I know,  but  it  serves  as a  reminder  to  my  children  that they  aren't so  weird  after  all. And  they're not. I do  like  that  they  include  the homemade  Gospel  tract  scene. I can  see  some  of those  being  made  in our future. They present the Gospel at the end as well. A great way to end a sweet film.

This is definitely  a  safe  film. You  could  turn  it  on  and  leave  the  room  without  having  to  worry  about what your  children are  watching. Bonus for  me  is  that  they  use  KJV  scripture. All  and  all  we  really enjoyed A-B-C Say  It  With  Me  Bible  Memory  Verses. I  asked  my  children  to  rate  it  for  me. They  give  it five stars.which means they LOVE IT!

6106468,5,B00GS8KRVA,This is a favorite at our house! I watched it with my oldest the first time and had to help foster a little excitement... Now she knows all of the verses AND their references.

This is priceless considering all the wicked Disney, tv, even Veggietales(ive noticed Masonic symbols). Don't let satan babysit your kids!

6106479,5,B00GS8KRVA,"There is so little good programming out there for children, but this one hit the jackpot with our whole family.  My children stared, smiled, and laughed through the whole thing, and they never seem to tire of seeing it again.  I also noticed some good fruit in my children as a result of them watching this over and over, which is very rare.  I say give us more, Moore Family!

A note for those who might want to know more:  The family featured in this film seems very conservative (a good thing, in my opinion).  You might be surprised to see girls in head coverings, for example.  The verses are taught using the KJV.  The verse for ""R"" is ""Remember the Sabbath Day to keep it holy,"" which may need to be discussed with the children if you don't observe Sunday as the ""Sabbath.""  For what it's worth, there you have it.  I hope you enjoy this as much as we do!",1403222400,10,862,4.265432098765432
6106480,4,B00GS8KRVA,I am the director of early childhood at a Christian school and daycare.

8626692,5,B00GS8KRVA,"Not 100% in line with our Biblical views (they seem to be something of a Mennonite-ish denomination(?) (some of the women wore head coverings, which my husband really frowns upon, as he sees a womans hair as her God-given covering. Also, repentance of sins is not necessary for salvation. Repentance, as used in the Bible, is to repent from your rejection of Christ, in order to trust Him as your Savior. They say in the video that you must repent of your sins.. which would be a work, needed to (essentially) earn salvation. Which is found nowhere in the Bible. Peter called for the people who rejected Jesus to repent, i.e. to change their minds about the sin of rejecting Christ (the unpardonable sin). True repentance of sins will result in works, not the other way around) We hold more of a Non-traditional, moderately conservative Baptist view... but the video is pretty close AND its  KJV, which is important to us. All of those semi-petty things aside, I love its innocence and children-based theme. I am hoping that our two year old starts to pick up the verses. She mostly just loves the animals and children in it so far.... because shes two... which is good though, because it keeps her attention until she can actually memorize the verses. We appreciate the effort that this family has put into this DVD. Its well-made for being a family-made film. Many thanks to the Moore family!",1530057600,,1394,4.713114754098361

Great quality, even mom, dad, or the older siblings can watch this without pain. : )  It's the 2-year-old's favorite; he asks for ""E-E-E"" anytime the moment seems ripe for it.  The little kids new entertainment on long drives is to start at A and see how many verses the kids can quote (upping the ""fun"" value by imitating the accents and inflection from the DVD), without parental/older kid involvement, although the older kids do moan loudly over the imitations part.

It isn't easy to find KJV anything to show your children so I was most pleased to stumble across this! I loved it so much that I went to their website and ordered the rest of their dvds they have made as a family (Amazon does not carry the rest).
