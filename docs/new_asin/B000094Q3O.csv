7989247,2,B000094Q3O,"Swept up in a nostalgia mood, I purchased the two CD set of old Flash Gordon ""Cliff Hangers"" and a single CD entitled ""Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe"". Little did I know that each was the same 12 episode serial that I saw in the movie matinee so many years ago. ""The Purple Death"" is also a title that may be attributed to this particular serial of Flash with Buster Crabbe as Flash.  SO, buyers beware, these two titles are the same thing. One just uses two discs and more packaging than the other.
The content is just as I remembered from my childhood, but in this day and age, all of those cutting edge 1940 special effects are quite comical. The dressed up lizards are great monsters. I wonder if kids of today would even like these serials. But, I have waited for a long time to see some of these episodes again. I just wish that I didn't have two of the same thing.
Oh well.
Keep on watching!",1277164800,2,902,4.2748538011695905
7989248,5,B000094Q3O,"Growing up in the 50's every Saturday morning I would journey to the local theater house in northern New Mexico to lose myself in fantasy land. The routine was 4 approc 20-25 minute episodes Flash Gordon, Capt Marvel and Zorro etc. These  were produced in the 30's and 40's at Republic and Columbia. Flash Gordon was my favorite, starring Larry ""Buster"" Crabbe also starred as Tarzan, these weekly episodes are also known as cliffhangers, usually in 12 or 16 episodes insuring the same audience every saturday morning for 16 weeks. The concept is at the end of each week the Hero or Heroine would be in some sort of eminent catastrophe such as going over a cliff, In a burning building, a fiery airplane and you would return next week to see the outcome. Flash Gordon was my favorite with the recurring cast of Flash, Dale, Dr Zaroff and ""Ming The Merciless"". The special effects and costume were pretty good considering they were fimed in the 30's.  My only warning is in the case of Flash Gordon some epiosodes are being sold under two different titles such as ""Flash Gordon Conquers The Universe"" and ""Flash Gordon The Puple Death"" so you maybe stuck with two identical serials under two titles.",1080777600,32,1198,4.7
