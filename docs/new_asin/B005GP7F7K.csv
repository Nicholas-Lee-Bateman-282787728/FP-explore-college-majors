8472079,3,B005GP7F7K,i'm a huge neal mccoy fan however having a big band doing swing music in the back of country songs just dosen't do it for me. it dilutes the country flavor to the point that it's not country anymore. i'm sure older folks will like this because of the big band aspect but i think i'll stick to the neal mccoy live dvd.,1359936000,,317,4.0476190476190474
