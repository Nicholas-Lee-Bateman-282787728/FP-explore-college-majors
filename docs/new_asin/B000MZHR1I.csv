8475988,1,B000MZHR1I,"There are better shows on cable TV, or PBS for that matter, showing how to stamp concrete.  At best this video provides an overview of the process.  There is nothing in it about ordering (other than volume calcs.) Nothing about stamp placement and tamping techniques (other than ""be sure they're touching"") Nothing about correcting errors or mistakes.  In short, if you can place and broom finish a slab, you already know 95% of what this video demonstrates.  (they show how to form a ""radius"" (curve) and how to stake a form for Pete's sake) If you can't place a simple slab you don't have any business stamping concrete.

I was really hoping for an instructional video that explained the details of stamping, coloring, staining etc. And I was optimistic that this video would explain the basics of marketing stamped concrete.

Don't buy this video it is a waste of money.",1281571200,,873,4.786666666666667
8475989,3,B000MZHR1I,"Not many DVD's on stamped concrete to choose from. I am rating the material 3 stars as ""Just OK"". I wanted to understand the range of Stamping & Coloring and have an idea of how to acheive some of these effects before pouring the concrete.
I am compairing this DVD to other construction videos I have used and achieved excellent results using their instruction & detail.

I just finished watching the DVD 3 times.
James Belville knows his art but his DVD lacks the details I was looking for.
Details about creating effects, how to tell when the concrete is ready to stamp, what slump and moisture content we are looking for. The products, stamps and why. Color Application rates. What we want of the material and don't want, how to correct problems for those new to the art. The ""antiquing"" process just sort of happens. It wasn't a clear process or how to control it. He spent a lot of time on site prep and forming which I wish was spent on Coloring & Stamping details, Effects; Timing of steps.
I would have liked to see other projects and how to create and vary the effects.
 I did get a lot out of watching the flow of the process. The DVD gave me a general knoledge of Stamping & Coloring, but I have a lot more work to do before I am ready to start.
