494008,2,6302676231,"This show tries to blend everything paranormal together e.g. aliens, supernatural,  crop circles, cults, religion, & just about anything else odd into one random show that questions nothing nor proves anything. I figured it would be like many other shows but this one has super shloky production value. The volume & clarity of the audio shifts from normal to muffled & barely audible. I liked some aspects of the show like the female narrator is appropriately creepy but found the show very frustrating to watch because of the audio problems & the lame content. For example,they continue to claim that a clip of crop circles supposedly being formed by orbs of light & still claim this is real. This was long ago proven to be fake & the guy who made the original film admitted to faking it. The orbs look like small plastic bags being blown across a field by the wind & clop circles just appear magically. Other parts of the series talks about the nutty cults that have committed suicide because they wanted to live on a non-existent planet or comet or something equally silly. They don't seem to question the validity of any of these ideas just expect you will accept them as some proof that these things make some kind of sense but they don't.

494062,4,6302676231,"This show is unlike anything else on... any media anywhere. Its kind of like if Tim & Eric had produced ""Ghost Hunters"".  Or maybe if  August Derleth was teleported to 2007 and was told to make a nonfiction show about the nature of phenomenological reality. IT IS AWESOME. But I strongly recommend not watching this if you're a normal person, or feeling tired & suggestible, or easily frightened.

DISCLAIMER: Please read the rest of this review knowing that I sincerely, actually like this series, but I'm pretty sure that some people will NOT like it. The folks who *won't* like this series will read the rest of my review and go ""that review made no sense..."" and watch something else.  (People who WILL like this show will say the same thing, but watch the series anyway.)

The main narrator, apparently a former German dominatrix-turned-transman (no offense to ze! it's just that ze is shot entirely from below so all I got was impressions) does a yeoman's job at hypnotizing us. Watch out; you'll be entranced before you even realize the show has started, and if you're not alert you'll miss the nictitating eyelid. (JK! Just a little eye shine!)  Experts consulted include a ""doctor"" or ""scientist"" (or ""author""? not clear) who looks a little bit like a guy you'd buy stepped-on cocaine from in one of those nightclubs with a real big, empty, and poorly maintained parking lot--but who has written an actual book so, no worries there. There is much ominosity (ominousness?) and the musical score and narrator's flat affect definitely adds to the strange disconnected feeling you start to have 10 minutes in...

I want to be charitable about the script itself because its very appeal comes from the fact it's not that canned bushwa you get on every single mainstream paranormal show, but I gotta say I think it was a) written by a non-native speaker of English; or b) written in German, put through Google Translate to Korean, and then sent to a half-Russian translator in the UK for translation to English. Oh, and then the whole thing was dubbed, maybe? I'm utterly sincere when I tell you that once you get used to it, this is charming and full of far more interesting content than you will find nowhere outside of maybe YouTube (and that requires so much digging!) but -- like good literature and abstract painting-- it requires a little work.

To complete the experience of ""Beyond"", even the episode descriptions are a little ""off""... they seem normal enough at first for a show about the paranormal and strange. You know, strange experiences, orbs and aliens, ghosts, Ouija boards, whatever. But upon actually READING the descriptions, not just scanning them, things start to look a little weirder (and more interesting for sure!) For one thing, if you look, every other blurb seems to contain the word predators whether referring to aliens, ghosts, or whatever I recommend reading these prior to each episode because they increase the sinister factor significantly. You'll find yourself being like, ""OK, clearly the CIA did this... wait, no, can't be--THERE IS TOO MUCH TRUTH...""  Yeah, I think either aliens or reptoids produced this thingbut you know, since the only equipment available to them was a 1985 VHS camcorder, one tungsten light, and a theremin, they did really well.

Before you begin Episode 1, be sure to write down on a piece of paper ""THE COSMOS IS NOT A TERRIFYING EMPTY DARKNESS FULL OF MALEVOLENCE BEYOND IMAGINATION"". If, when you're done, the writing on the paper hasn't changed, then you'll be okay and can return to your normal programming.",1459900800,,3579,4.871710526315789

494356,2,6302676231,"Beyond, Season 1

Pros:
Content was interesting and intriguing! While not looking for evidence myself some people will criticize this on fact and the lack thereof! It is ment to be entertaining! Strangely it was..... Slightly!

Cons:
This was horrible and incredibly hard to watch. It looked and sounded like it was done in a basement in the 1970's! If that is what they wanted to portray, well they nailed it! Editing, sound and video quality were incredibly ancient, Considering the Original air date is April 6, 2005!

Conclusion:
Episode one's opening monolog should tell each and every viewer what they are in for in the season ahead. I would have rather watched a 1970's documentary on candle making than watch this garbage. I could have done a better job filming and editing with mid 1980's home A/V/E equipment! Out of respect to the content, I rated the second star!

I watched after regarding the description of the first episode in disbelief...uh, no, the brain does not use ""plasma"" to ""fire the synapses""...plasma is in essence blood minus the blood cells...the synapses are the gaps between individual nerve cells and the electrical mpulses are carried across them by chemical transmitters.  I started laughing when I realized the description refers to ""electromagnetic plasma"", a phrase come up with by a religious-based charlatain with (depending on exactly which source you consult) an online ""university"" degree in ""human services"" for a book about a ""form of psychology"" he personally developed which supposedly is nothing new but is presented in a new way.  The beginning of episode one is even worse...there you hear such BS as that the brain continues to function for three days after brain death (uh...gee...how stupid would we have to be to believe that one, eh?), and that this extranormal functioning releases the so-called ""plasma"" which forms ""orbs""....etc.

That this body is just a shell provided to interact with this dimension and that part of heaven is being freed of it and melding with other energy forms and sharing the joys of communal knowledge and serenity.  I know how that sounds but I have more or less intuited it since I was a little kid.  And, as an adult, it occurred to me that we really are nothing but batteries.  Electrical energy powers our hearts, lungs, brains, and nerve pathways.  A heart test is an ELECTROcardiogram.  A brain test is an ELECTROencephalogram.  Our main body content is WATER, a perfect vehicle for transmission of electricity.  When I was about 19, and newly married, our car broke down and I told my husband it was ""the carbuerator"". It WAS. There is no way I could know that.  I'd never had my own car or any exposure to anyone who knew about cars. When I was in my 30s, I was at a movie where a cop said ""What language is he speaking? Does anyone know what it is?""  I told my companion: ""Albanian.  It's Albanian.""  It WAS.  How would I know that?  When I was 34, I dreamt of a man and two weeks later I met the exact man for the first time.  There are many things that can't be explained in normal ways.  I've had many such experiences.  BUT, I don't just accept information.  AND, the way these people talk is way too hokey for me.

Specific example: In the first several episodes they talked about the Leeds Poltergeist and never actually explained events that took place, just that it had been studied and was a well documented case, but then never gave any more information on any evidence collected.

And then claiming only cameras pick them up because our eyes see different frequencies.  The fact is we can easily set a modern camera to ""see"" the same frequencies as our eyes, and with the proper lighting and focus they will continue to pick up ""orbs"" of dust.

7829258,3,6302676231,"I definitely enjoyed watching this -- especially the segments on spells and the one on Tesla. It was all pretty entertaining, however, what killed it for me was the relentless theme music which was something out of every overdone paranormal expose show on television. If you've got some time to spend and favor this kind of entertainment, you will probably thoroughly enjoy this, except for the music. Oh, and the deadpan announcing by the very pretty woman in between segments was somewhat hard to take. She looked so serious, it made me laugh.
