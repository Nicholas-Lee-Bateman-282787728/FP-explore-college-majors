Pam Dawber makes a delightfully sweet little mermaid, and Treat Williams is great as her distant love. Karen Black makes a splash of a performance as the sea witch, and Helen Mirren turns in a nice performance as the prince's wife. It's a very good version, but I wouldn't say it's the best version of this story. I really, truly loved it though.",1076457600,,498,4.606741573033708

It followed the original faerie tale version, so the end was a little sad (I almost felt like crying). But it taught a good lesson and did end on a happy note.",988243200,2,267,4.056603773584905

The episode is hosted by executive producer, Shelley Duvall, who has suffered hard times in recent years. Treat Williams played the sailor and the prince who was saved by the little mermaid known as then Pearl. Mork and Mindy's Pam Dawber played Pearl, the mermaid who gives up her life below the sea to join the mortal world. Saturday Night Live's Laraine Newman and Broadway's Donna McKechnie played her mermaid sisters. Brian Dennehy played their father, King Nepture. Karen Black played the sea witch.

It is an entertaining episode but not much else exists on this DVD. If you're looking for a happy ending, it doesn't end like happily ever after. This series and the episode was filmed long before the animated version of the story in 1984. With an exquisite cast, they pull a job in telling the children's story. Remember that this episode and the series was for young viewers of the time period. I wished that they were extra features .",1505606400,,1119,4.7979274611398965

Faerie Tale Theatre""s ""The Little Mermaid"" is a bit of a mixed bag.  A heartfelt story with much more of a tragic tone than the more famous Disney adaptation, it is undermined mostly by laughable underwater swimming visual effects.  However, it does also offer a great cast to compensate for other shortcomings.

Starring Pam Dawber, Brian Dennehy, and Treat Williams, ""The Little Mermaid"" shines in its screenplay and in its fairly sumptuous palace detail.  Once Pearl, the titular mermaid played by Ms. Dawber is on dry land with her adored prince, the true strength of this adaptation comes through.  Dawber can be very expressive without saying a word, and Treat Williams plays a very solid prince.  Additionally, the prince's fiancee is played with unexpected compassion and authenticity by none other than Dame Helen Mirren.

Also starring Karen Black and Laraine Newman, Faerie Tale Theatre's ""The Little Mermaid"" is far from the best entry in the series.  Nevertheless, it is very classy with admirable fidelity to Hans Christian Andersen's original story.",1272412800,,1081,5.238372093023256
7861681,5,6304107374,"""Faerie Tale Theatre"" productions are sometimes scary (""HANSEL & GRETEL"") and often hilarious (""LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD"", ""THE PRINCESS AND THE PEA""). Rarely are they as touching and as poignant as this version of
""THE LITTLE MERMAID,"" directed by Robert Iscove from a teleplay by Anne Beatts.
  You won't find any Disneyfied sea creatures singing a Broadway musical number under the sea; or a tacked-on Disney ""happy ending"" here. What we do have is a beautiful, live-action version that is faithful and true to Hans Christian Anderson's original bittersweet fairy tale.
  The cast is superb. Pam Dawber's role as little mermaid Pearl, who sacrifices everything for the love of Sailor/Prince Andrew (the extremely attractive Treat Williams), is largely mute. So she must communicate her emotions mostly with just her eyes and face. The depth of sadness and despair she conveys in the face of unrequited love is truly heart-breaking.
  Brian Dennehy is Pearl's father King Neptune, and also serves as Narrator. Loraine Newman and Donna McKechnie are featured as Pearl's sisters Coral and Anemone.  Karen Black makes a memorable cameo appearance as the Sea Witch who begs Pearl not to sacrifice everything for the love of Andrew. ""Trust me,"" she says, ""no guy is worth it. Love is a disease that only humans catch. And once you've caught it, you can never be rid of it."" The Sea Witch also tells her that when she walks on human legs, she will feel a pain like walking on knives. Nevertheless, she is prepared to endure anything. Unfortunately, although he cares for her, Andrew's heart belongs to Princess Amelia (Oscar winner Helen Mirren). Given a final opportunity to save herself, Pearl still can not and will not betray her beloved; teaching us that true love often requires truly tragic sacrifices.  I actually cry every time I watch this.",1183334400,4,1844,5.003267973856209
7861682,3,6304107374,"In response to M. Reinking's review, I agree that Disney's The Little Mermaid was the best Little Mermaid movie.  And the quality of the acting and etc. of the Faerie Tale Theatre version is a little sad, but it was made in the 80's..or early early 90's...

Also, she did become a Spirit of the Air in the original Hans Christian Anderson story...because she spared the Prince's life.  So I value this version of the story, because it's the first (and so far, only) true version of the actual story.  I think that's what was good about all the Faerie Tale Theater movies.  Also, if anyone happens to know...there was a bunch of fairy tales that used to show on the Disney Channel.  Does anyone know what those were called?  Please, let me know...",1106092800,2,746,4.522388059701493
7861683,3,6304107374,"QUOTED FROM M REINKING -""""One also must note the ending, which tries to change the sad ending of the original fairy tale where the Mermaid turns into seafoam, and that's the end of that. But here, they make her a ""Spirit of the Air"", so she can watch over her Prince. Blah. A bad ending to a bad film.""""

M. Reinking obviously did not read the original story by Hans Anderson. Yes the mermaid did start to turn to sea foam, but that was not the end of that. in the book she was transformed into a ""Daughter of the Air"" and given a second chance at obtaining an eternal soul. So M Reinking doesn't even know what they are talking about.

As for the film, Yes, the special effects would be laughed at by kids today spoiled with amazing looking films like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. Where the film still stands strong though is in the story and performances by Pam Dawber, Treat Williams and the always admirable Helen Mirren. Shelly Duvall did a great service for kids in the 80's with her series of Faerie Tale Theaters. Sure today we have films and series of better quality but I would hope that everyone who grew up with these can still appriciate them the way they did when they were kids.",1102636800,4,1200,4.328888888888889
7861684,5,6304107374,"FAERIE TALE THEATRE's touching and tender recreation of THE LITTLE MERMAID (the second-last in the series) is one of their best efforts.

Pearl (Pam Dawber) is a beautiful young mermaid who lives with her father King Neptune (Brian Dennehy) and her sisters Coral and Anemonie (Donna McKechnie and Laraine Newman) in a kingdom at the bottom of the ocean. When Pearl comes of age and is allowed a brief glimpse of the world above the sea, she falls in love with a handsome Prince (Treat Williams) whom she saves from drowning when his ship has a fatal explosion.

She makes a bargain with the Sea Witch (Karen Black): her voice in exchange for a pair of legs and hopefully the love of the Prince. Once on land Pearl quickly returns to the Prince, though he only has eyes for the lovely Princess Emilia (Helen Mirren).

What follows is a heartbreaking story of selfless love and sacrifice, as Pearl risks everything for true love...

Pam Dawber leads a strong cast. Karen Black is amazing as the Sea Witch; Newman and McKechnie are a delight as Pearl's sisters and Treat Williams fills the role of the Prince admirably. A true gem in the series",1099785600,10,1141,4.633663366336633
7861685,3,6304107374,"Faerie Tale Theatre is a very charming series, a perfect way to entertain the family. From a very young age, I have enjoyed viewing the 1 hour videos based on classic stories that everyone is generally familiar with. And many of them were truly well-done and true entertainment. My view changed quite a bit however, when I saw their ""The Little Mermaid.""

Now generally we must be forgiving in the special effects department, knowing that these films were on a low budget. But if a low budget was the case, than ""The Little Mermaid"" should not have been a part of this. The chords holding up the underwater actors are very obvious, and the overall look of the film is just sad, and laughable in places.

The acting is also a major sleeper. Pam Dawson is nothing but boring in her role, putting no effort or feeling into her dialogue, and no emotion into her pantomiming after she has traded her voice for a pair of legs.

One also must note the ending, which tries to change the sad ending of the original fairy tale where the Mermaid turns into seafoam, and that's the end of that. But here, they make her a ""Spirit of the Air"", so she can watch over her Prince. Blah. A bad ending to a bad film.

If you are going to watch Faerie Tale Theatre, I highly recommend the series. But if you get the full DVD set, just throw this one out. You'll be glad in the end that you did.

7861686,5,6304107374,"This film takes us under the sea to explore the world of Pam Dawber as the Little Mermaid, curious about the world above.  Treat Williams plays the perfect prince and Karen Black plays a surprisingly beautiful sea witch.  The sets are wonderful and the music is hauntingly beautiful.  The special effects are a little fishy, but that's okay. This film is a wonderful adaptation of H.C Andersen's classic story. You won't forget this movie.  Highly Recommended.
