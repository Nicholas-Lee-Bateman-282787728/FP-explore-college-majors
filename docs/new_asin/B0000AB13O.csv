7996477,1,B0000AB13O,"This is a remarkably bad movie, even by Don Wilson's meager standards. I'm sure there are folks in the world who enjoy low-budget, sci-fi B-movies and for whom ""Futurekick"" fulfills some personal niche, but for me, this is just lousy, unimaginative filmmaking, the only good thing about which is that it sets a low standard to which all future Don Wilson sci-fi outings thankfully rise above.

The story: in a dystopian future where corporations control the world, a wealthy female moon-dweller (Meg Foster,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/They-Live/dp/B0000AOX0F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">They Live</a>) arrives on earth to track down her husband's murderer - a task for which she enlists the aid of the last member of a race of lethal androids (Wilson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ring-of-Fire/dp/B000094FE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ring of Fire</a>&nbsp;series).

Give cult producer Roger Corman credit for being game enough to give every weirdo script that fell into his lap a chance; a filmmaker would *have* to be pretty indiscriminant to try and make something of this. Mind you, this isn't to say that the script co-written by Catherine Cyran (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cry-in-the-Wild-II/dp/6305865620/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cry in the Wild II</a>) couldn't have been made into a decent film, but rather that the moviemakers were foolish to attempt it on what must have been a small budget. With a plot that clearly outweighs this one's financial resources, the results include embarrassing computer effects, cheapo sets that hardly convey it's a futuristic setting, and a perpetually dark lighting scheme. This last aspect is the worst for me: absolutely every scene is filmed in shadow, making the movie an entirely depressing experience.

The film features five fight scenes; three of them are crud and the other two (including a showdown between Wilson and his late friend, ex-<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reservoir-Dog/dp/B000HC2LEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reservoir Dog</a>&nbsp;Chris Penn) are only marginally better - all thanks to that awful lighting scheme. Beyond that, there's only a car chase to see, and a bucketload of gore. This one's clearly the bloodiest flick Wilson ever starred in, but even that isn't worth seeing the film for by itself. Characters are lucky if they're two-dimensional, seeing as some (e.g. Don Wilson himself) are completely lacking in character at all. Bad guy Eb Lottimer (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beyond-the-Call-of-Duty/dp/B0001DCXWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beyond the Call of Duty</a>) goes through the whole movie stabbing people and ripping their hearts out, but at the end he's still the most boring serial killer you'll ever see.

What else can I say? I have nothing substantially good to write about this one. Admittedly, I've never been a fan of Don Wilson's movies, but this is the absolute low for him. I don't often blame a single movie for ensuring a director's success or lack of, but man, am I not surprised that Damian Klaus hasn't made another picture since this one.",1361664000,3,3268,6.144420131291028
7996478,5,B0000AB13O,this is one of those movies that keeps u on the edge of your seat.  i love action and martial arts. Don the Dragon Wilson is great,1348790400,,130,3.814814814814815
7996479,1,B0000AB13O,"FUTUREKICK!!

Saying it out loud sounds fantastic.  It just rolls off the tongue.  Hell, even the trailer featured on other Horizon releases looks pretty awesome, and sells you exactly what you want: kicking...in the future.  So, by all means, it's gotta be great, right?  WRONG!

This film is boring.  The worst thing an ""action"" movie can be is boring, and this film is boatloads of boring.  It's bad in all the wrong ways, and believe me, I love me some bad movies when they're the right kind of bad.  Futurekick is not that kind...it's the worst kind.  Don't watch this.  Go find a copy of Penitentiary 3 and thank me later.",1333065600,5,628,4.5675675675675675
