The beginning half the movie follows a group of soldiers fighting which then promptly just disregards and forgets about.wheres the continuity? Then even worse the movie just ends, as if they ran outta movie or film and thats it. Don't waste your money. A michael bay movie has more of a plotline then this does.",1295740800,,399,4.47945205479452
