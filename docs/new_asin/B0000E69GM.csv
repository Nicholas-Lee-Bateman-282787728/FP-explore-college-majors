8001873,4,B0000E69GM,"Many years ago, I guess in the late 70s, I used to watch a lot of late night talk shows (Johnny Carson, Dick Cavette, Merv Griffin). They had a lot of comics as guests and I seem to remember Dom DeLuise as one of the frequent visitors. I always got a kick out of him. Thus it was as I was sorting through a bin of bargain DVDs and found ""Happy, A suspense Thriller"" with DeLuise in the lead roll. I picked it up because I remembered him, plus the bin was very low on DVDs and this was one of the more reasonable choices.

I had no idea Dom DeLuise was a film actor. I thought he was just a stand-up comic. In any case, in this movie DeLuise plays washed-up TV clown who has lost his program five years ago and is eeking out a living doing gigs for small businesses, children's parties and the like. Then comes a big opening act opportunity for him. Just as he is starting with his act, a professional assassinator crashes the party and takes out his victim, an important witness. He also sprays a lot of bullets around wounding a few people and fatally wounding DeLuise's partner. DeLuise, of course is a witness to the event and provides an accurate description of the invader in a rather strange and unusual way. As such, he becomes a target of the assassinator as well. It's a weak story. The acting is fairly good. The filming is fine, as is the sound. The bad guy is, well, really bad. It's just not a terribly good movie. Yaawwwnnnn! I was ready for bed anyway.

8001874,4,B0000E69GM,I enjoyed the movie. It seem a like a low budget film. But I like any movie with Dom DeLuise.,1265155200,4,93,3.7
8001875,4,B0000E69GM,"Then again, if you're thinking of buying this there's a good chance you're a fan too.

Cute made for TV movie, predictable but enjoyable.  DVD comes with commentary by Dom, Carol and David DeLuise, also worth a listen.",1129766400,7,218,4.7105263157894735
