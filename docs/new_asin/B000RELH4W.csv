8200048,4,B000RELH4W,"Another foray into the (apparently) endlessly fascinating world of 'women in prison' by the indomitable Euro duo: (producer) Erwin C. Dietrich and (director) Jess Franco - working under the pseudonym Michael Thomas this time around. The German titled release ""Gefangene Frauen"" (""Caged Women"") is also known by other titles, such as: ""Island Women"" & ""Women's Penitentiary VII"". Whatever the name, it's essentially just another (good) excuse to get a bunch of attractive girls naked and throw them into some sexploitationally abusive situations. This is seemingly one of Franco's 'favorite' genres as he directed MANY different takes on the theme over his career - so it is hard not to compare this one to some of his other similar efforts. As such, I could see why he, possibly, chose to use an 'alternate' name for his credit on this film - because, in my opinion, it isn't really one of his best - certainly not in the same league as the more gritty & transgressive ""Sadomania"", ""Barb Wire Dolls"", or ""Women In Prison"" (to name but a few!). The premise for this film may offer some insight into 'why' the tone is softer.

In the simple plot line a 'dictator' in some nameless S. American (?) country is worried about his international reputation because of the rampant prostitution in his country - so he decides to have all the hookers scooped up (nude!) from the bordellos where they work and deposited out onto the desolate off-shore 'Rat Island' - to keep them out of sight. He installs his hot girlfriend as the wardeness to watch over things. The 'difference' in this concept is that the re-located girls are not really 'criminals doing time' as in a typical WIP scenario - they are sorta 'exiled' but their life isn't too bad and they spend their time 'servicing' the guards on the island and seem to (almost) enjoy it. Of course many of the 'classic' WIP elements are present: nude showers and hosing down, naked examinations by the sleazy doctor, enforced sapphic couplings, and the odd punitive whipping scene for 'bad behavior'. But even with all these elements at play, and all the girls 'forced' to be naked all the time, the movie doesn't really generate much 'heat'. In the 'last reel', after much lack-lustre abuse has been endured, three of the girls manage to escape and, ironically, end up 'happily' back in the whore-houses where they started - while the dictator's regime is toppled by a coup.

What does make this DVD worth watching (and possibly owning) is that it features some very gorgeous girls (especially the amazingly put together Brigette Laihie!) and lotsa nudity from beginning to end. Franco loves to zoom in on the female crotch and this flik offers some prime gynacologicial viewing - which is about as 'nasty' as it gets - all boy/girl sex scenes are 'simulated'. Technically speaking, the image quality on this DVD is exceptionally clear and the colors striking. The film starts w/ a sequence that looks like it was shot at an actual 'competition' for Miss Best Breast and the audio for this segment is only in German - but once the 'real' movie kicks in it does switch to English (if so selected). The only 'extras' included are a few trailers for other Euro sex romps. As previously noted, maybe not one of Franco's most inspired efforts, but chock full of 'live nude girls' and that's generally what one looks to Franco to provide.

Please be sure to note that this is a European Region 2 PAL disk and requires a 'region free' DVD player to view it.",1397692800,2,3493,4.760726072607261
