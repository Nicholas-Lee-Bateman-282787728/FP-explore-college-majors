8741365,5,B0184DLHZQ,"Attempting to call any film by Nagisa Oshima his masterpiece is a formidable business. Everything from BOY to CRUEL STORY OF YOUTH or TABOO carries the weight of a glorious filmmaker. With DEATH BY HANGING we witness an actual execution but the criminal doesn't die and suddenly suffers from amnesia. The doctor, chaplain and police present are so confused and helpless, and become more so as they attempt to recreate the crimes in pantomime modes hoping to get a new confession and then begin the execution again.

The music is 3 decades ahead of its time.

The actors are fabulous featuring Oshima's wife who also starred in the disturbingly brilliant SING A SONG OF SEX, as well Kei Sato, the villain behind the penetrating VIOLENCE AT NOON.

I almost don't even want to keep writing this review; I just want to go and watch the film again and again. Its got so much depth to the story, as well as a great analysis in the bonus features!

Thank you Criterion for keeping Oshima's masterpieces alive !",1456617600,17,1003,4.681818181818182
