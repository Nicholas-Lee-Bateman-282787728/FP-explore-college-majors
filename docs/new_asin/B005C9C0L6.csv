Korea and Japan are both represented in this sweet and engaging production. Lee Jun Ki from Korea and Aoi Miyazaki from Japan are the young couple who meet and find constant love in director Sang-hee Han's First Snow, which he cowrote with Kazuhiko Ban. Beautiful shots of both countries frame a deceptively simple tale of young love which has humor and, after a time, an emotional depth and sweetness missing in films coming from anywhere except Korea. Korea has taken the torch dropped by everyone else and has been the champion of romanticist cinema for well over a decade now. Even films dealing with a slightly younger generation than A Moment to Remember and Il Mare have a special quality that touches the heart in a way films coming from other countries do not.

Min is nursing a wound from falling off his bicycle when he stops to take a picture of a Japanese girl at a shrine. He is Korean, there in Japan for a year with his father, who is a potter. Nanae is the shy and lovely Japanese girl from Kyoto he finds enchanting, and is unable to get out of his head. There is much humor as he begins school, oblivious to much of the language because he is Korean. A fight over his bike results in a very funny fencing match caused by the language barrier. More hilarious are his efforts to save her painting case he has inadvertently caused her to drop in a river. With a bit of help from his two school friends, Min and Nanae find moments of sweetness and, perhaps, a love which can last forever. Beneath their blossoming happiness, however, lies a dark shadow, revealed only to the viewer. Nanae's life at home is less than idyllic, watching out for her young sister when her mother is drunk, and standing up to her latest boyfriend, who often beats her mother and poses a threat to Nanae and her sister as well.

Discovering she loves pottery of a particular kind, Min finally takes an interest in his father's work, so he can learn the craft, and Nanae can paint his pieces. He senses the loneliness behind her smile, however, which will finally cause her to disappear when he has to return to Korea for a short time due to his grandmother's ailing health. Gifts exchanged have a greater poignancy for Nanae, but he is never able to read her note due to circumstance. Feeling abandoned, and angry over what might have been, he moves on as best he can, forgetting the promise of a date in the first snow, and its true meaning. Two years later, Nanae has gained some success as an artist, and by chance they meet again. Still in pain at her leaving, he can not connect again at first, until his old bike racing pal lets him read her memory notes, and his grandmother reveals the letter. A night of first snow will have him rushing to the tree where the fortune teller's note hangs, wondering if she will be waiting this year, still.

A wonderful ending to a touching story makes this film very special, for movie lovers of any age. Serene and beautiful in its visual look, funny and poignant in its understanding of love which can begin as young adults, but remain a lifetime when it is real, anyone with a romantic heart will enjoy this film greatly. A sweet and marvelous treat for the heart.",1336867200,,3356,4.5073891625615765
