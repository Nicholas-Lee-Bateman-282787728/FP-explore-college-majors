3484758,2,B001B7CO0K,"I love Selena Gomez.  I really do.  She couldn't be more adorable, she's multi-talented, and she usually steals the show in every scene she's in.  But this movie is just so unsuspenseful, I couldn't even dredge up an ounce of sympathy for her character.  I couldn't feel any chemistry between her and her leading man, either.  Nada.  The only clever part of the movie was when she danced with him undetected behind the 1-way mirror.  Otherwise, my entire family was simply...bored.  Ah, well.  We remain huge Selena fans, however, and will continue to enjoy her talent in Wizards of Waverly Place.",1221868800,4,597,4.8316831683168315
3484759,2,B001B7CO0K,"I thought Katharine Isabelle and Emily Perkins both rocked in this movie!  I didn't care too much for the rest of the movie, as the plot was very predictable and more geared to the under 18 crowd.  But every-time Katharine and Emily had their screen time, the quality of the movie moved up a couple dozen notches.  I thought they were absolutely hilarious! The pillow fight and the dance room brawl between the two are scenes that will make your belly ache in laughter.  The chemistry between these two Canadian actresses, both stars of the cult horror film Ginger Snaps, is again evident, providing a chance for the two to show their comedic talents. It's too bad that a comedy couldn't be made with just the two of them!  How about a TV series?",1221868800,3,746,4.537313432835821
3484760,4,B001B7CO0K,"Usually sequals do not turn out so good (this is not really a sequal) but it was enjoyable to watch... Even though this is completely different than the Cinderella Story with Hilary Duff, it has a similar plot and everything; however I actually liked it better than the ""Cinderella Story"". It had the masked ball as well but it goes well with the following events and Mary's preparation to go in the path of dancing. This is supposed to be a musical version of the ""a Cinderella Story"".

Mary (Selena Gomez) works for Dominique, her step mother, and her two step-sisters. She bumps into Joey Parker [the guy she has had a crush on since maybe 11 years old ] several times and dance at the school masked ball. She heads home early so that Dominique will not find out and Joey Parker who is a dancer/singer looks for her.

Mary loves and practices dancing on her own time and basically dancing is what brings Mary and Joey together.

I recommend this movie which is good all the way (music and acting).",1221609600,36,1000,4.483516483516484
3484761,4,B001B7CO0K,"This is a nice movie. There are some great dance scences and the storyline of Cinderella being a backup dancers daughter, I have to say I would have never thought of it. It's sweet and I love the ending when they sang together. I will admit that I saw the movie on another site but it has since been taken down due to some prudist who complained about something that obviously wasn't there.

3484810,5,B001B7CO0K,"This movie is literally the BOMB.COM. I am in LOVE with Selena Gomez and this movie is an all time fav. A HUGGGGE hit!! Fun fact about this movie is that Selena was 16 (im impressed by slightly accurate character age representation) when filming this and even more interesting is that Drew Seeley, her love interest, was frickin 26 and playng a high schooler. A lil weird, but it just goes to show how mature Selena was for her age early on in her acting career. Overall it was lit and I will personally have a copy of it in my grave.

3484822,3,B001B7CO0K,"The movie was  watchable. It is quite a fun movie.

******Light Spoilers*********

The good -
1. Drew Seeley is good as the popstar who is sweet and not arrogant
2. The acting from Selena Gomez was decent
3. Some of the songs especially 'Just that Girl' were good little pop songs, great for dancing along to
4. The movie moved along at a nice pace. It was a little funny in parts and there was just enough music added to make it fun to watch

The bad
1. The step-sisters were a little annoying and Britt especially was quite unattractive awkward looking in this movie. When she asked Joey if he wanted to kiss her, I thought ""Are you serious?""

2. The step-mum was a deluded has been popstar with no talent. Played by actress Jane Lynch I laughed a couple times

3. The bestfriend/manager Dustin was very annoying. He was not cute and the silly dancing and rapping made him look geeky, not cool. I notice so many of these movies feature the not so cool (but think they are super cool) black bestfriend.

4. The ending is cringe worthy like another reviewer said. The talent show featured no great acts, some of the dancing was awful and the parts with Selena and Drew were so corny I wondered who would sit and watch that nonsense and then applaud and cheer. It was unrealistic.

5. The age difference between Selena and Drew was a little noticeable. Especially since Selena has always looked young and looks about 13 years old in this movie.

6. I found it a bit silly that he goes to their school and they are acting like he is this 'Justin Bieber' like popstar that they cannot get close to. He is there walking around with no bodyguards for most of the movie but in a few scenes girls (and even boys) are screaming, trying to touch him or they are shocked when they see him coming in a room.",1490400000,,1796,4.3532934131736525

Not sure if the bad dancing is what through me, but I found it difficult to watch the corny dance scenes. The end is the worst.. the dance competition is just downright cringe worthy.

This movie was poorly done on all accounts and the only redeemable parts were the ones with Jane Lynch (her best work is the Sleepover). Also how did that dog survive under that pile of clothes since Christmas? And the Selena Gomez songs were just catchy enough for me to want to bang my head against a pile of knives repeatedly. If you have a thing for one way mirrors, this movie is for you. I don't think anyone in this movie can actually dance, they're all just faking it and relying on the sketchy songs in the background. Also that Natalia girl wasn't even pretty (see- no one even remembers her). I also love the stereotypical sidekicks on both ends of our protagonists, and Disney's attempt to be racially diverse by instituting one black guy to hold the weight of the entire film's cultural celebration.",1438646400,,859,4.512820512820513

3484940,4,B001B7CO0K,"I LOVE dance movies! And this new, updated version of that old clich, has a lot of dancing. In addition, there were some things that I found particularly enjoyable:
  * Jane Lynch (""A Mighty Wind,"" ""Best in Show"" and ""Talladega Nights"") is the BEST wicked stepmother that ever walked the face of this earth! ""Clean up my room! That fish stick has been laying there since Lent!""
  * The new and improved magic pumpkin is an orange VW van, driven by our heroine's BFF (best forever friend).
  * Cinderella is now called Mary. She is played by Selena Gomez who has done a LOT of television work. She has a certain toothy charm that is uniquely her own.
  * Prince Charming this time out, is called Joey Parker, a successful pop prince who is taking a breather from his high-profile existence to ""return to his roots"" and try to remember why he loved dancing in the first place. Joey is played by the yummy Andrew Seeley (""Complete Guide to Guys"" and ""Christopher Brennan Saves the World"").
  * The selfish step-sisters are played as dumber and dumberer (they aren't aware that their zip code isn't 90210; in fact, they might not know for sure what a zip code actually is!).

The inevitable dance contest had some terrifically talented competitors; in fact, I might have chosen a couple of them over our eponymous heroine.

In this Beverly Hills-based version, Jane Lynch is a music video star, totally self-centered and nasty. I loved that she called one of her masseurs ""Fabio"" ...and NOT in a flattering way! She travels in a stretch limo, while her much put-upon stepdaughter travels on a skateboard.

This particular iteration of the classic story boasts some very clever choreography, which masks the shortcomings of the two stars. In fact, the choreography is so good, I didn't really care that our hero was a faux Justin Timberlake, complete with the cute fedora and the dance maneuvers with the floor stand of his microphone! When they shot it in silhouette, I really couldn't tell WHO it was!

All of the characterizations are VERY broad with everything painted in neon colors so you won't overlook anything. The camera work and editing are strictly music video'ish and the dance duet featuring our two leads is cleverly done in front of a two-way mirror, so HE thinks he's dancing with his image, while SHE knows he is thisclose to her. Fun!

There is one chaste kiss, mild language and of course, the sweet happily ever after ending.",1437782400,,2441,4.724056603773585

The younger generation will relate to this story, and the older generation will appreciate the re-made version of this timeless adventure. Ms. Gomez is an aspiring dance student whom desperately wants to be enrolled into the new dance class w/the other kids, and of course the most popular boy that all the girls want to be with is there as well. Without giving away too much of the story here, let's just say it's a wholesome new young teen/adult version of boy meets girl, and they fall in love kind of story(really sweet). I would definitely recommend this movie for all to enjoy, as this was done w/out any foul language, violence, and nudity, which is such a refreshing thing these days considering how much of that vulgar stuff is in every movie it seems nowadays!!

Dominic is simply hilarious with her ridiculousness and her daughters are so socially awkward that you can't help but laugh.

The storyline has times when it's definitely 'unbelievable' as real life, but who really wants real life in a movie anyway?!

I thought, imidiatly, oh no! Don't do it! Sequals to happily ever after movies like A Cinderella Story never work! Never.
Boy, was I wrong.
I watched this expecting the worst [and I knew that Disney Channel Stars would, of course, be playing the lead parts] and I was pleasently surprised.
I actually like this movie just as much as the first. I think the fact that it's a Dance movie with lots of plot changes and twists makes it edgey and a good laugh!
I must say, although I wasn't expecting to, I really enjoyed this!
And Selena Gomez is a very talented actress/singer/dancer which I hadn't realised before watching this. I don't think Disney Channel does her justice.
Drew Seeley was also very good and I hadn't realised he could act. I thought he was just a singer.
All in all I loved it and I think it's worth checking it out if you're a Dance movie fan or if you like the first Cinderella Story.

3485166,3,B001B7CO0K,"2008's Cinderella Story is a cute, child-friendly story about a washed up pop-star named Dominique whose deceased dancer left her daughter Mary(Selena Gomez) in her custody, and now of course she slaves away for her doing terrible and ridiculous things like vacuuming the driveway.  Mary secretly desires to be a dancer, stowing away to class hidden behind the mirror, where only she can see how good she really is; that is until teen idol Joey Parker(Drew Seeley) comes back to his 'roots' to finish high school and be a 'normal teenager'.

The high school goes crazy when Joey arrives, especially when he announces his upcoming contest for the best dancer to dance with him in an upcoming project. Post the school's black and white dance where Mary and Joey tango together he can't forget about his mystery girl, and is looking for her with her music player she left at the scene of the crime.

I do have a number of complaints, the foremost being the sheer fact that along with the previous 'Cinderella Story' I am not stupid enough to believe that wearing a small mask hides who you are. Last I checked philosophers have always deemed the eyes to be the windows to the soul, and I can see clearly that you are in that spicy red dress Selena. I can clearly see that it is you who is dancing with Drew, it is not difficult. (Same goes for you Miss. Duff!)

Also the fact that Seeley is 10 years older then Gomez freaks me out more then just a little, and no wonder the complete lack of chemistry all together. (What happened there?)

I will admit that some of the songs are cute and catchy like 'new classic' and 'tell me something I don't know'. Although I may be ashamed to listen to them frequently, Seeley's Timberlake-esque vocals plus that typical pop sound are a good(if tired) combination.

Overall it's a cute, predictable movie that is perfect for it's target audience, which can't be said for some of the others in it's category.",1222560000,15,1942,4.598265895953757
3485167,5,B001B7CO0K,I like this Another Cinderella Story Movie it sort of reminds me of the Cinderella Story with Hilary Duff and Chad Michael Murray. Another Cinderella Story has alot of simliarities like the Cinderella Story Movie had. Selena Gomez and Drew Seeley fitted those character roles very well in the movie is Mary and Joey Parker. Selena Gomez is Best Known from Playing on Disney's Wizard's Of Waverly Places She did a great job as Mary in this movie. I saw this movie on YouTube is the whole movie. so I don't have the DVD yet. Since I liked the movie I would love to get Another Cinderella Story on DVD!!!!,1222387200,,602,4.4818181818181815

8282123,1,B001B7CO0K,Im writing this from my dads account. I am an 18 year old girl and used to watch this movie as a kid. So I was was super excited to show this movie to my boyfriend. Little did I know about halfway through there was a part missing! So now Im spectical that other parts are missing as well. The part I had caught is when the Step-Mother goes to L.A. and Mary is left with a long note. If this was the whole movie you would know that the step-sisters are in their car giggling because they wrote the long list of chores so Mary would have less time with Joey.,1522972800,,556,3.9732142857142856
