8745616,3,B019OWXPME,I saw the show - I'm a diehard Elvis fan.  I recognized every 4th or 5th song.  The setlist was a little different in LA but still - can they please put out the IMPERIAL BEDROOM tour he recently put together?,1511222400,,208,4.048780487804878
8745617,2,B019OWXPME,"This is the worst E.C. show ever! I could hardly recognize the songs. You can find my copy in the used bin at my local record store along with five more. Evidently, I'm not the only one disappointed.",1464912000,4,199,4.2631578947368425

8745619,5,B019OWXPME,"Outstanding sound and video quality. Im only a few minutes in, but video captures much of the fleeting magic that I experienced on Mr. Costello's Detour tour. It also brings his wonderful set back to life.",1456704000,3,205,4.722222222222222
8745620,5,B019OWXPME,"I enjoyed watching Elvis Costello and his special guest Larkin Poe. He performs a total of 27 songs when you count the bonus tracks. Larkin Poe adds a new flavor to 9 of his songs with a lapsteel guitar and mandolin. Elvis performs on stage with a giant TV and sometimes inside of it. His stage discussions include some family history with family pictures including part of a video where his dad performs If I Had A Hammer.
The bonus tracks are:
1) Love Field
2) Either Side Of The Same Town
3) Brilliant Mistake
4) Ascension Day",1455321600,6,529,4.408163265306122
