5714695,5,B00CCC3Q2S,"Forceful acting and storyline centered about a young girl's crossing from Mexico into the US and the help she receives from a person who herself receives an unexpected reciprocal help. A similar strong portrayal is found in ""The Owl and the Sparrow"". As a counterpoint portrayal ""What Maisie Knew"".",1378080000,,298,5.1020408163265305
5714696,3,B00CCC3Q2S,"Ashley (Abbie Cornish/Sucker Punch) is attempting to get her son (Austin West) back from foster care. She has a low paying job supporting herself while living in a trailer. On a trip to Mexico with her dad (Will Patton) she discovers he is making good money transporting people across the border. Ashley has a plan to make a big score doing the same thing, but things don't pan out. She ends up reluctantly caring for a young girl (Maritza Santiago Hernandez) whose mother was apparently killed in the crossing Ashley orchestrated.

The film is well acted. It is heart warming and gritty at times. It is a tale that is more about character than plot. I did not find this ""Lifetime"" type of film overly entertaining or enjoyable in spite of being well done. I did enjoy the innuendo on her work smock, ""Can I Help You?"" Perhaps fans of ""Lifetime"" films can find enjoyment in this feature.

5714697,5,B00CCC3Q2S,"I'd been waiting for months to get this on DVD, but the wait was worth it.  Great acting by all, but especially enjoyable was Will Patton doing a perfect imitation of a mature Robert Duvall -- at first I though it was Duvall in a cameo role.  It was a little uncanny.  And, Cornish struck me as kind of a cross between Ashley Judd and Katherine Heigl.  Maybe it was the lighting or camera angles.  She was wonderful, believable, as was the little girl.  Enough people have already described the plot, so I'll pass, and end with the observation that this movie captivated me, and is the best movie I have seen in decades.",1409616000,4,620,4.394736842105263
5714698,4,B00CCC3Q2S,"I hadn't heard of this one, but my husband had.  The beginning was stilted, but as you got into it, you bond with this woman.  She has been a loser in life.  But there is still a heart and as it grows and the story unfolds, you see life through her eyes.  As she helps the young girl, she blossoms.  I do believe she learned sometimes when you think you have it bad, seeing worse makes you thankful.  She probably was wondering why in the world did the girls mother think they could of had it better in the USA, they had family, friends and love where they were at.  I would bet she gets her son and returns that place in Mexico.",1408665600,,629,4.065040650406504

5714700,3,B00CCC3Q2S,She was so perfect for that part.  I went looking for other films by her.  It looks like she is a big star in Australia with many films to her credit.  I picked one out but the story was very ordinary and slow.  Periods where she just stands in one place and looks around.  I was disappointed.,1394668800,,293,4.0701754385964914
5714701,5,B00CCC3Q2S,"So I'm browsing Netflix looking for something interesting to watch, and you know how you accidentally tap something you had no intention of tapping, and it starts downloading, and you're too lazy to cancel it and move on? Well that's what happened to me with this film blandly titled ""The Girl.""  So it starts with virtually no credits except for acknowledging the unknown-to-me director David Riker. Oh, and I didn't even get a chance to read the synopsis, so I don't even know what the heck it's about. But I decide to watch a few minutes of it anyway.

Well I gotta say, I watched the whole thing from beginning to end and it was absolutely wonderful. Experiencing this film was like being drunk and barefoot on the beach and suddenly, but gently stubbing your toe on a 24 carat diamond buried in the sand! What a sobering and refreshing cinematic examination of motherhood.

Simply told with little melodrama but loads of heart, ""The Girl"" is the story of Ashley. She's a young, single, trailer-park, minimum-wage Texas mother, desperately trying to clean up her not-so-dirty life so she can get her five-year-old son back from the family social services have placed him with. With a court date looming, she's visited by her likable trucker dad (a gritty and entertaining performance by Will Patton) who invites her to chill by taking a ride with him to Mexico where he's now living with his lovely and pragmatic Mexican girlfriend.

On the trip back to Texas, Ashley discovers her father is transporting Mexican Nationals in his truck across the border. She freaks out, realizing if she had been caught in the truck with him, she could be arrested and lose any chance of regaining her son. But her dire financial situation makes her take another look at her options. Without her father's knowledge, she decides to get in the game of smuggling human cargo.

Her first attempt is a total bust,  resulting in not only a zero payday, but most importantly, the tragic loss of life and a five-year-old Mexican girl, Rosa, being separated from her mother. Totally frustrated, but knowing the pain of a mother-child separation, Ashley, fluent in Spanish, drives all over the Mexican city with the young girl in tow trying to find her mother.

The bond between Ashley and Rosa is not always an easy one, but over the course of the three days spent together, they come to respect each other; even care for each other.

This is no fairy tale film. Tears are rarely shed. There are no Wagnerian outbursts of pain and anguish underscored by weeping violins. Suffering is often quiet and contained against the back-drop of the hauntingly beautiful Mexican countryside and whispering winds.

Abbie Cornish as Ashley is simply magnificent. Her performance is honest and unadorned and so moving you totally forget she's acting. Her quiet moments are her best. She may not have thought much of herself as a mother, but it unwittingly comes natural to her as she constantly holds it together for the sake of her separated son Georgie and her temporary guardianship of Rosa. And yet, as much as Abbie's Ashely tries to hide her emotions behind body language and trailer park bravada, the deep feelings from her heart betray her, gushing from her luminous eyes time and time again.

And kudos to the very young and talented Marlitza Santiago Hernandez as Rosa. What a revelation! This beautiful young unsmiling little girl, whose face is a stunning portrait of the ancient Incas, has probably never been to Hollywood. Her performance doesn't seem like a performance at all. No cutesy child-actorisms here. She is simply a strong little girl determined to find her mother. Miss Hernandez is a true natural.

The chemistry between the two actresses, especially during some of their funny, sometimes heated exchanges, all in Spanish (English subtitles), is a major factor as to why this film works so well. But a ship doesn't steer itself. Writer/director David Riker has created a heartfelt movie that doesn't pull at the heartstrings. It plays them gently, softly. From beginning to end, Mr. Riker maintains a tone that touches us and uplifts us without a lot of horns and whistles. By the end of the film, I fully understood the significance of the title. Nothing bland about it at all. It's as simplistically beautiful as the film itself.",1392249600,7,4323,4.860054347826087
5714702,5,B00CCC3Q2S,"If your like me and like movies that are uplifting due to their transcendent qualities, this one is a must see no matter what your leanings may be.  On so many levels this movies grows, develops and ultimately redeems us through its message of altruistic tendency.  I liked it too simply for the transporting richness I felt from the diversity and cinematic scenes of new and old Mexico.",1390176000,,387,4.676470588235294

5714704,5,B00CCC3Q2S,This is a well done film about a poor white girl who lives on the Texas-Mexico border who gets involved in transporting Mexicans into the US.  One of  women drowns in the river crossing leaving her small daughter with no one to care for her but the American..

8580205,5,B00CCC3Q2S,"I was hesitant to watch this movie because at first it didn't seem interesting. However, this movie is beautiful, I fell in love with the characters, Rose and Ashley, and the story.
This is not a movie filmed to excuse or promote certain practices or to make people change their mind about immigration. Although the story is very emotional but very mind opening at the same time, because  it makes you think and see things that never cross our mind. I loved the scenes in Mxico's town and the little cultural insight. A Very compassionate film indeed.",1530748800,,551,4.680412371134021

8580208,3,B00CCC3Q2S,"The Girl is slow moving, lots of shots with Ashley driving, looking, walking. Her Australian accent comes out in one scene, not sure why the director let it go. Sure she is transformed through this ordeal which is inspiring. The one scene in Mexico where she gets drunk is out of place. It feels like it was stuck in for no good reason, it does nothing to add to the plot.",1530316800,,372,4.253521126760563

Unfortunately, the operation went wrong and the mother of a little Mexican girl drowned in the river. The main character experiences many emotions: a desire to leave the little girl for the authorities to deal with her, but overwhelmed with guilt trying to get the little girl back to her only relative-her grandmother. Very emotional film. Very good acting job!",1530144000,,519,4.909090909090909
8580211,4,B00CCC3Q2S,"This film was was deep and beautiful and sad and redeeming and she was just great in it: Abbie Cornish.

You know how you see an actor / actress for the first time and then look for their movies? Surprisingly, I'd just seen her in 'The Good Year' with Russell Crowe (years ago, then watched it) last night. Then today, reading the intro for this one, saw her name and looked up movies she was in and realized I'd just seen her last night in The Good Year. From looking up her films, I first watched her in Somersault tonight then watched this one; a much more mature part and character. She is a very engaging actress; you are just drawn into her performance and her face and deep quietness.",1526428800,,691,4.315384615384615
