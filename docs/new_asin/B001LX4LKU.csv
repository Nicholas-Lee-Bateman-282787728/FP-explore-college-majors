8320037,5,B001LX4LKU,Great story and I wish the USA would have more  shows like this one. Am on my second round of viewing it,1384300800,,104,3.727272727272727
8320038,5,B001LX4LKU,I can't wait to finish my collection of Mcleod's Daughters. I'm still saddened that it couldn't go on forever. The best drama i've seen in a very long time.,1235174400,,156,4.413793103448276
8320039,5,B001LX4LKU,"I love McLeods Daughters.  Of course like most people I started watching it on WE TV.  I picked it up in the 3rd season and was very disappointed when they cancelled it.  I bought all the seasons and an currently watching Season 7.  I am disappointed Season 8 is the last season, but so glad I have had the opportunity to see the whole series.  It is a wonderful show.

8320040,5,B001LX4LKU,Awesome show with great characters and storylines. By the way the series is scheduled to come out in MAY 2009!!! I can't wait.,1230681600,6,126,4.521739130434782
8320041,5,B001LX4LKU,I just heard that Season 8 WILL be coming to the U.S. in May 2008. Yee hah!,1229904000,3,75,3.4705882352941178
8320042,1,B001LX4LKU,"What disappointing news.  Season 8 is available in Australia, region 4 format, but of course living in the US I've got a region 1 player.  I've just started watching Season 7, and can't believe I might never see the final season.  I may have to investigate 'alternate sources' or check into a multi-region DVD player!",1229558400,2,317,4.7272727272727275
8320043,5,B001LX4LKU,"i am also very upset that I will not be able to get the ""last"" season of McLeods Daughter's.  They can't just stop and not put the last season on DVD.  i was really upset when they quit airing this show in the US, but was thrilled when I found the other seasons on DVD to buy.  Now they are doing this again.",1229212800,,308,3.857142857142857
8320044,5,B001LX4LKU,Gave it 5 stars because I'm sure it will be. This better not mean we will not ever be able to get Season 8? How could they do this? How could they not sell us Season 8? Where would we be able to get it? I'm going crazy over this. Please Amazon you have to get us Season 8.,1229040000,2,272,3.6271186440677967
8320045,1,B001LX4LKU,"Does this mean we will be able to purchase the final Season 8 DVD or not since under the information it says ""this is being discontinued by the manufacturer.  Or does it mean there will be NO more after season 8?

I know the taping of the show stops at season 8 and I am so upset I can't stand it.  I will certainly go into McLeod's with drawals.  I have all the seasons from 1 to 7 now and hope I can get 8.  I will wait a year then watch them all again and pretend it is the first time to see it again.  Is everyone as upset as I am that this wonderful show is leaving us?",1229040000,11,574,3.7416666666666667
