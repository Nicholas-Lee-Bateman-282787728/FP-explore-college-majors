It seems that for half of the movie all that is going on is people are walking down the mountain then back up with water, then repeat.  The drama unfolds with some slow motion shots of people almost tripping and/or spilling the water.  I have to say there are some intriguing moments though.  If you must see this movie, I would recommend the box set 'Beautiful Women of China'.  For a few dollars more it includes this movie, Ju-Dou, and Life Show.  Please note that as in the Ju-Dou individual DVD reviews, the video transfer quality is sub-par for Ju-Dou in the box set as well.",1213833600,4,707,4.616
