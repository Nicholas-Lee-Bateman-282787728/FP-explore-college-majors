2002728,5,B0001HYDDM,Information packed with documentation and realistic drama. History filled with photos that helps with visualization. I would recommend highly. Good,1369440000,,147,6.4
2002729,4,B0001HYDDM,This is one of the better documentaries about the Underground Railroad I've seen. Abolitionist Thomas Garret is the focal point of the story. The documentary does a good job of pointing out the challenges the abolitionist had in thwarting the spread of slavery.,1363737600,3,261,5.093023255813954
2002730,4,B0001HYDDM,This was a well done (although basic) documentary that had excellent stories and wasn't cheesy. Overall it was worth the watch!,1358812800,2,127,5.095238095238095
2002731,3,B0001HYDDM,"Ok, Ed Asner Hams this up a bit but it's still a good summary of the little known Thomas Garrett, arguably the greatest Underground Railroad Conductor in U.S. history.",1305417600,,167,4.793103448275862
2002732,5,B0001HYDDM,"This is a well-made documentary about the Underground Railroad and the abolitionists of the period who put in great effort to stop slavery. There are interviews with prominent historians which provide much insight into the Underground Railroad, which stretched from Maryland's eastern shore through Delaware, Philadelphia and further. These interviews are interspersed with reenactments featuring Edward Asner as Thomas Garrett and Blair Underwood as William Still, two important abolitionists on the eastern line of the UR. ""Whispers of Angels"" is an excellent production that can be used as a resource in classrooms for Social Studies, Language Arts, and History. Total running time is 60 minutes.",1272499200,2,699,5.666666666666667

2002734,5,B0001HYDDM,"excellent footage about the information of The Underground Railroad. There were more details that I didn't know or better yet didn't learn in school, because like a lot of our history it isn't taught in the school system.  But this footage is excellent to share with others. William Still collected information and wrote it down, and publish it in a book as we all know it as The Underground Railroad.",1455840000,2,401,4.728571428571429

2002748,5,B0001HYDDM,Great movie/documentary. Powerful and extremely touching. EXCEPTIONALLYWELL DONE! - VIVID PORTRAYAL OF THE ABOLITIONISTS HUMANITARIAN WORK AND THE SECRETS INVOLVED!!,1399075200,,165,7.3
2002749,5,B0001HYDDM,This si a learning piece of work for us all. I think schools should invest in this DVD & add it to their curriculum.,1396396800,,116,3.875
2002750,4,B0001HYDDM,"I thought the film was very thought-provoking.  My only problem for the past two months is that all your movies stop, start, freeze up and it takes two hours to watch a 50 minute film.  This started sometime in December and has gotten worse since then.  It resale hard to go to your content now, because the constant strop, freezing up and starting again makes what used to be a pleasure, norm very enjoyable anymore.",1393286400,,417,4.533333333333333
2002751,5,B0001HYDDM,"It was enlightening to have historical facts and data available for  viewing and too see and learn more about my heritage, since black history wasn't share or acknowledge as a primary, or necessary  subject matter in schools approx. 20 to 30 years ago. If you learn anything in details about it; it was on your own and not from school, which is truly sad.

It was unbelievable to hear someone comment, their views as the UGRR, literary being and actual train underground.
I recommend this literature & video to individuals, who are not familiar with their black history.",1392595200,,570,4.795918367346939
2002752,3,B0001HYDDM,"We may have enjoyed this video more if the audio was loud enough to hear the narration.  Without subtitles, it is nearly impossible to follow.",1373414400,,142,4.68
2002753,4,B0001HYDDM,I found out some thing about the underground rail road that i didn't know. I was more familiar with some of the people who were involved further North. It did miss on the fact that not all the motives of the abolitionist were based on helping to free slaves. Much of it was political to destabilize the Southern Economy and try to prevent the build up toward the civil war.,1370390400,2,373,4.3428571428571425
8012756,5,B0001HYDDM,Powerful...Sad to be part of this history,1484697600,,41,5.0

8012758,5,B0001HYDDM,This was a god review of the American history that I didn't retain from grammar school.  Well done and reaffirms that together we are stronger than apart.,1473465600,,154,4.703703703703703

8012760,5,B0001HYDDM,"I watched this recently and I saw where the current TV series ""Underground"" captured some of the people portrayed in this documentary.  This was so interesting I couldn't stop watching it.  It gives insight into the life of the slaves and their families, slave owners, free blacks, and abolitionists as well as the members of the underground railroad...their worries, fears and the tremendous amount of stress and anxiety that they endured (this may not apply to all slave owners).  ""Underground"" does an excellent job of capturing the depth of the characters and it gives a perspective of slavery, especially the slaves, not seen before on the silver screen.  I purchased the book, ""The Underground Railroad: Authentic Narratives and First-Hand Accounts"" by William Still which I will give a review after I finish reading it.",1463270400,2,826,5.141791044776119

8012764,5,B0001HYDDM,Great video for school. The information was very appropriate for 8th graders.,1458259200,,77,5.5
8012765,5,B0001HYDDM,Excellent overview for those not familiar with the history and value of the Underground Railroad.  It is so worth an hour of your time!,1457308800,,135,4.625
