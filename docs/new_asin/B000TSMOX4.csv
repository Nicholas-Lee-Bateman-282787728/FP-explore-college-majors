8210657,4,B000TSMOX4,This is an excellent presentation of the global warming/climate change problem. The film then turns on Exxon and the Valdez Spill and Exxon's resistance to facing the climate problem. The film also reveals how difficult it is to get government action on the climate problem. I only wish that chapters had been formatted into the film to make it easier to review and to present to others. Without chapters one has to fast-forward and reverse to review parts of the film.,1289260800,,469,4.802469135802469

The film is nothing glitzy, but a solid presentation of the ways in which ExxonMobil attempts to corrupt the national discussion of environmental concerns and energy policy.  With massive resources to buy advertisements, to subsidize think tanks, and to hire an army of PR agents and lobbyists, ExxonMobil can reach deep into the hearts and minds of countless people.  But the best spin efforts sooner or later run up against the realities that ""Out of Balance"" reveals through interviews with people like Ross Gelbspan&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boiling-Point/dp/0465027628/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boiling Point</a>&nbsp;and Bill McKibben&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fight-Global-Warming-Now-The-Handbook-for-Taking-Action-in-Your-Community/dp/0805087044/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fight Global Warming Now: The Handbook for Taking Action in Your Community</a>.

""Out of Balance"" covers some of the alternative energy paths we could take, and the director ends up purchasing a van that he fuels with used cooking grease.  I'd like to see future films criticizing one or another corporate criminal suggest the idea of nationalizing rogue businesses, or revoking corporate charters&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unequal-Protection-The-Rise-of-Corporate-Dominance-and-the-Theft-of-Human-Rights/dp/1579549551/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unequal Protection: The Rise of Corporate Dominance and the Theft of Human Rights</a>.
