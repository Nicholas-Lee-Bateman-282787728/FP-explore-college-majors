You get to visit a selection of watch manufacturers in Europe to see how their products are made, but I can't help but describe this DVD as a showcase rather than a documentary. I don't really learn what goes into making a fine watch so much as I SEE what a person does to make a watch which qualifies as ""fine."" There is a difference, and it is an important distinction.

I like to see things from start to finish. I like to see every stage of the craftsman's process, and the pitfalls of designing too much into too small a space. I think the potpourie of watch manufacturers in this film detracts from the subject, as a better approach would have been to follow one manufacturer from start to finish.

I own another DVD on this topic which details the Hamilton watch companies manufacturering process. While that film is undoubtedly an hour long advertisement for the now defunct company, it gives a history of the pocket watch and showes the governing principles behind it which I thought was fantastic.",1371600000,,1194,4.544186046511628
8312072,4,B001J72NUI,"I thought this video was great. It had a lot of things that someone in my position just doesn't get to see. I have to admit, I was surprised at the negative reviews for the ""risque"" section. It was very short and wasn't bad at all. I thought it was placed properly to frame the horologist being introduced.

I highly recommend this dvd.",1366761600,,336,4.333333333333333
8312073,4,B001J72NUI,"Does anyone want to sell or copy their copy of this DVD? I can't seem to find it for sale anywhere and am getting pretty frustrated.
Thanks!!",1297209600,,141,4.2592592592592595
8312074,2,B001J72NUI,"I'm not sure how to rate this product.  99% of the film is spectacular.  Great insight into how these watches are made, interviews with leaders in the industry, awesome watches etc.  5 star material.  But, there is a very small section in the middle of the film about an erotic/pornographic  watch.  This part is completely indulgent by the film maker - it's not important to collectors (at least this one).  And, this very small section really tarnishes a wonderful work.  It's just a shame.  I'd love to be able to use this film to show other's (friends, family, etc.) why I'm attracted to mechanical watches - but, unfortunately, I can't.",1289174400,2,641,4.754545454545455
8312075,5,B001J72NUI,I love this documentary.  It sits on my desk and gets viewed often.  My only regret is that I cannot watch this with my children as there is about 20 seconds that is unnecessary and mildly offensive.,1255392000,,199,4.351351351351352
8312076,3,B001J72NUI,"This was a good look into the world of mechanical watches. For a newbie to the subject, like me, it was pretty interesting and informative.",1239148800,,139,4.6
