8642971,1,B00IK6XN14,"HELP....somebody.
I bought this BLU RAY which is supposed to play in all regions.
It says that right in the product description.
I was very psyched to watch it, and nothing comes up on my  SONY BLU RAY player but BD ROM.
Are there any techies out there that can help.
Maybe there is a setting on the player for BD ROM.
I've never had a DVD or BLU RAY have a problem in my player.
I'd rather see the show than have to replace the BLU RAY with another one that isn't going to play either.
Thank You",1522454400,,496,4.01010101010101
8642972,5,B00IK6XN14,"Once again Runrig show why they are one of the world's great live bands. Reuniting with them for the 40th are Peter Wishart ( former keyboardist for both Runrig & Big Country), and the incomparable vocalist Donnie Munro. On one song Donnie & current lead singer Bruce Guthro sing together & their voices mesh very well. Having accidentally ""discovered"" Runrig on a PBS World Music show back in the 1990's I have listened to them religiously, even ahead of The Beatles. I even bought a region free, adapted bluray player just so I could watch their Pal format dvds on my NTSC tv. Yep, I kinda like this band, they speak to my soul. Buy this dvd & if you're even a casual fan you won't regret it.",1501286400,,694,4.4296875
