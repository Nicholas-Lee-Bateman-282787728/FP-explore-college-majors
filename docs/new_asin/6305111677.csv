969378,4,6305111677,"One can't say enough about how really funny this concert is.  This concert shows Richard Pryor at his very best.  There are so many bits, including ""The Heart Attack,"" ""Shooting the car,"" ""The Pet Monkey,"" that it's unfair to begin to list the laugh-so-hard-that-you're-crying material.  Now, to the bad news. The mastering of this tape is the worst I've ever seen.  Period, bar none.  While the picture is acceptable (obviously no time or expense to improve on the VHS product), it is the sound that is really disconcerting. A good half of the DVD, the sound is out of sync with the picture (I know this because I returned my first copy as being defective and got a new one that was exactly the same).  It is unforgivable to see the lack of care that was put into this product. No extra features of notable mention.  It is trully a shockingly poor representation of one of the all-time great comedians at his comic best.",1005609600,46,921,4.579268292682927
969379,3,6305111677,"I've always found Richard Pryor to be very funny.. Once I saw this concert on DVD I couldn't stop myself from ordering it. However, I was very disappointed to find how the picture and sound qualities were of that level.. They were way below expectations..
I gave it 3 stars for the material.. I can not give it a single star for the quality.",992995200,9,341,4.34375
969380,1,6305111677,"DVD: Lip-sync is way off, there is ghosting all over the place.  This is NOT the same recording as the audio tape version, and although the material is the same, the delivery is not as good - very disappointing.  Buy the audio tape for a few quid... you'll enjoy it far more - extremely funny! Whoever relesed this DVD should be flogged.",971222400,17,337,4.419354838709677
969381,1,6305111677,"Richard Pryor's comic genius is ever apparent in this DVD.  His scenarios and timing are just guaranteed to create tears from laughter. However, the quality of the DVD was extremely poor.  There is shadowing around Pryor and  the audio track is way off!",951609600,11,253,4.837209302325581
969382,3,6305111677,"One of the all-time greatest stand-ups is dealt an injustice with this poor transfer to DVD.  The poorly compressed video causes a very annoying ""lag"" as Pryor moves about the stage--his hair seems to moves  moments after the rest of his body.  My VHS copy taped from cable years ago  looks better. Still, it's easily the funniest 90 minutes of stand-up you'll  ever see. Alone, Pryor's performance earns this 5 stars, docked two stars  for the poor quality.  This performance deserves better!",915321600,3,493,4.939024390243903

969552,1,6305111677,Richard Pryor is an all time great comic and the audio recording on this dvd is completely terrible.  There are pauses and stutters throughout the dvd.  Very hard to listen to and in my opinion not really worth buying.  Better off trying to find some other recording.,1371168000,,267,4.638297872340425
969553,3,6305111677,"At the beginning when the house lights are still up and a man is in front taking pictures of Richard, is that Denzel Washington in the front row?  He has a mustache and bell bottom pants, but it sure looks like him, even has the same mannerisms I've seen in interviews and movies.  This totally distracted me from Richard, so I had to start over, but how fun if it is him.  He would have been about 25 at the time.  Anyway, if you are offended by this DVD it's your own fault.  Its Richard Pryor for sakes alive!  I enjoyed it and laughed alot!",1329609600,,544,4.133333333333334
969554,5,6305111677,"This is Richard's greatest concert. Filmed in Long Beach, California with Patti LaBelle opening, this maybe the greatest stand up performance ever.",1312934400,,147,5.7272727272727275
969555,5,6305111677,"Richard Pryor is a foul mouthed drug user. Highly inappropriate; I am deeply offended! Seriously though; I first heard a cassette recording 16 years ago of the same material found in this video and have loved RP ever since. I actually recommend that cassette if you can find it (doubtful) or the record format if you have a turntable. It's called Wanted Richard Pryor Live In Concert. The delivery is even funnier. Yes, it's possible. Even without the visual. I promise! Otherwise, this DVD is definitely a worthy subsitute. :)",1304208000,,527,4.866666666666666
969556,4,6305111677,"This is hands down, Richard Pryor at his best, however this review is not about the quantity of the DVD, it is about the QUALITY. I have this concert on VHS and my tape shows better than this DVD. That's why I gave it a 4 stars instead of 5.

Richard's afro moves whenever he moves. It's like he's the Matrix or something, it's kind of hard to explain. And the audio is slightly off. His mouth moves maybe one milliliter of a second after the sound, which is rather annoying. There is another version of this DVD made in the 2000's, hopefully that one is better.",1295568000,2,562,4.252336448598131

969648,5,6305111677,I love this show. It has always been one of my favorite concerts of all time.

969652,5,6305111677,"Before I give my impression of the movie itself, I'd like to add I saw it on videotape (which has become the visual equivalent of eight track cassettes).  Therefore, I can't comment on the dvd remastering (which many reviewers detested). Just understand that the one star reviews are not for the movie itself.

This is Richard Pryor's best stand up comedy film. He is the farthest thing from politically correct.  However, though not as politically oriented as Lenny Bruce, Pryor does not make the mistake of much modern ""out there"" humor and bask in offensive stereotypes. He uses stereotypes (e.g. how white people react to black people, the ""macho"" stud who has little regard for women)and shreds them to pieces.  Then there are parts such as where he imitates what dobermans would say if they could talk that are really bizzare but they work. As compared to his next stand up comedy film ""Live on the Sunset Strip"", this is better. Richard Pryor's audience didn't automatically love everything he joked about yet and the part of the film where he confronts a heckler is hilarious.  Chances are you know someone like the cast of characters he creates. Few comedians can live up to this non stop hilarity.",1135814400,4,1207,4.811594202898551
969653,5,6305111677,"The writer Stanley Crouch chose a fine time to write his article in the New York Daily News about Richard's ""flawed legacy"", how he perpetuated the stereotypes and attitudes that are at least in part responsible for the current state of our culture. We knew Crouch to be a mediocre writer but now we have enough evidence to understand that he is intellectually retarded as well (in addition to having an absurdly volatile temper). In his attempt to set up Pryor and Cosby as binary opposites, he reveals nothing about either performer and everything about his colossal misunderstanding and if he ever sobers up into reality he will be ashamed of himself. At its highest point, art is not here to enshrine anyone's values, it is here to expand consciousness. ""Pryor reached for anything that would make white America uncomfortable."" These can only be the musings of a man who has not done his homework on his subject or who has only processed the information necessary for him to push his feeble viewpoint.
This DVD is the best video document we have of Pryor in concert, taped in Long Beach, featuring his timeless impressions of women, children, animals, winos, his musings on Ali, Leon Spinks, rednecks-- his tremendous physical and emotional expression, his frailty and his humanity. ""Here and Now"" and ""Live on the Sunset Strip"" are also astonishing, but here Rich is at his most unleashed.",1134345600,13,1394,4.886075949367089

969655,3,6305111677,"The film itself is one of the funniest movies ever made - definitely five stars.  However, the transfer to DVD is abysmal in that the soundtrack rarely coincides with the video so one of Mr. Pryor's greatest assets, his facial expressions, are annoying out of sync.  Too bad - wait for a remastered version!",1125792000,18,307,4.666666666666667
969656,5,6305111677,"Live in Concert is Richard Pryor's best stand up comedy routine by a comedian ever!  Finally, this concert has been given the respect it deserved and has been REMASTERED!

969754,5,6305111677,"While the past few decades have seen the emergence of tons of comedians who spit out swears and graphic subject matter with reckless abandon, precious few have taken offensive subject matter and turned it into something intelligent and entertaining at the same time.  Denis Leary, Bill Hicks, and Dave Chappelle come to mind when I think of such a select group, but Richard Pryor may well have towered over them all.  And 1979's Richard Pryor: Live in Concert may have been his definitive document.  This 90-minute standup DVD sees Pryor giving a manic, imaginative, deliriously profane performance that had the audience in the palm of his hand from beginning to end.  A master impersonator with a vast pantheon of characters and voices, Pryor didn't just talk about his subjects, he *became* them; he acted out every person, every story, and every idea to the fullest extent possible, constantly blurring the line between real and make-believe.  Jokes about animals quickly gave way to spot-on imitations, whether of the inner thoughts of Dobermans or of his pet monkey's illicit sexual activities.  Pryor's musings about racial differences in expressing grief were funny and insightful, but they were merely a setup for an outrageous recounting of his grandmother's reaction to his cocaine habit.  There are also plenty of brutally honest stories about Pryor's life with his father, ranging from his father's death in mid-coitus (""he came and went at the same time""), to the one time Pryor stood up to his old man (""It wasn't really a fight, but I did the best I could""), and their time hunting together (""I hated being the dog"").  Pryor's honesty and insightfulness come out in plenty of other places too, from his troubles with the law to his heart attack to his less-than-stellar boxing career.  All throughout, though, no matter what the subject, Pryor piles on joke after insight after impression with pitch-perfect timing and plenty of scatological language.  For those of any age, race, or political leaning, this is a must-see.",1119657600,51,2037,5.053731343283582
969755,5,6305111677,"Richard was incredible on the album, and the video is even funnier. Black men walking too cool to be bitten by snakes...deer drinking...dogs consoling him when his pet monkey died....sexual inadquecies...Richard hits it all, and it's as funny in 2005 as it was when it came out. Chappelle, Rock, Murphy... they all pay homage to the Jedi Master of Comedy. This was him at his best...",1118793600,2,383,4.818181818181818

It is refreshing to get this on DVD because now I can share the absolute brillance of a comic mastermind with my Gen X Nieces and Nephews.  None of the new comics can capture real life moments like Pryor.  His facial expressions alone are worth the price of admission.

969761,5,6305111677,"No one has ever done it better... and probably never will.  The timing and just overall reality of his humor is perfect.  He can find humor in things we are generally scared to even deal with or talk about.  He makes you feel like you were there.  This was pre-burn Pryor at his best... yeah, it was back before his African trip when he denounced the usage of the 'N' word (you'll hear it in almost every sentence on this one) but his takes on seemingly everyday things is what makes him a genius.  If you want to laugh hard, and aren't scared to see things the way they are, get this.",1016755200,,585,4.1875
969762,5,6305111677,"First saw this very funny show of Richard Pryor at Long Beach, California when it first came out back in 1980 and I almost wet my pants with laughter.... I showed this hilarious tape to many friends and they too howled with pleasure at Pryor's brilliant satire on everything from mean dogs, amorous monkeys, his grandma's cooking and being forced to go get a decent switch so he can get a decent whippin' !!
So I was stoked to see this special arrive on DVD....However, picture quality is nothing short of very average (I was getting a headache watching the disc...and sound is definitely out of sync on numerous occassions !!
