3747294,4,B001PIHP2M,Very beautiful scenery. Very bad acting. I thought you would see more wildlife and more of the Grizzly bear in it. Disappointed there. Overall though very good story.,1448236800,,166,4.964285714285714

3747297,4,B001PIHP2M,"Although ""Iron Ridge"" was ultra low budget. There were a lot of great moments in the film and the shots of scenery in Montana are incredible. This film has a lot of production value. It is amazing to me that the film makers were able to pull off as much as they did on the limited budget. This movie centers around the human element and the risks that rescuers put themselves through to save people they have never met. I read that ""Iron Ridge"" was self financed and was the first feature film ever shot in the state of Montana using 100% Montanan's.  I don't usually have high expectations for indie style films but I really did like this movie. Solid performances and a very compelling story. If you are looking for a home grown film and not expecting a 50 million dollar picture then this film is worth adding to your library.",1241136000,,829,4.4183006535947715

3747326,2,B001PIHP2M,"Good movie, not a great plot, But some of the scenery reminds me of the days before CGI. Very beautiful backdrops. The main character, the ranger in my opinion, was a good cast. However the story between the lost hunter and his wife could have used a little more substance or even some excitement. Overall good movie on a Sunday in the house, not a ""Nail bitter"" just a good watch.",1483920000,,381,4.380281690140845
3747327,2,B001PIHP2M,Supposed experienced alcoholic hunter takes pitiful city slicker into the wilderness to hunt.  Sends the city guy off to look for deer.  City guy is lost and does not even have enough sense to shoot his gun to let his friend know he is lost and where he is.  He just keeps wandering around holding his gun in a manner so as to drop it at first stumble.  Scenery is okay though.  Rescue should bill the two idiots for their time.  Irritating for the viewer.,1483488000,,456,4.305882352941176

3747353,2,B001PIHP2M,"This is a low shelf film. It's hard to write a bad review on some levels because I honestly feel sorry for it...cast, crew, all. So it got a second pity star for simply showing up and getting made. I suppose it's quaint in message and story enough to be vaguely entertaining...if you can manage to suffer through the complete lack of anything anyone could call acting. To get to the one or two minutes of stock looking, filmed off site bear footage at a different location/time of day from the scene at the very end is painful...Not with an actor (stunt handler hand appears in one frame) They do credit the bear at the beginning, but it seems to be perfunctory. If you are looking for ""The Edge"" type film, don't here...not even close. This is like it only very remotely in concept alone. The guy that get's lost in the woods behaves very stupidly, you have a rifle in your hands dude, fire it into the air much? It makes a loud bang you know...to help your equally dumb buddy triangulate your position at least, he could in turn do the same in response to help let you know where he is. Especially right when you realize you are lost, you are probably quite nearby, you just don't realize it. I mean yeah, people get lost in the woods, often going in circles in a small area, they do dumb things (I'm certainly not arrogant enough to think I wouldn't do a few dumb things too), but this guy is beyond any notion of common sense. He's basically trying to die out there through ignorance. Fortunately the incredibly brief appearance of the bear, looking all scary, does nothing to our wayward moron...he get's some fake blood on him...the bear...just vanishes. Too expensive to include a realistic mauling, so skip that...bear just bit him a couple times and wandered away off camera...I guess. Our hero the ranger is over 300 pounds and looks like he is ready to collapse at any moment...which he...sorry if you actually want to watch this. I'd say don't waste your time or money on a rental...only if free...the acting is monotone to embarrassing...the wife scenes...oh geez, possibly worst I've ever seen, dialogue, character, acting..the whole ball of wax...she's awful. I feel I'm doing a public service with these ""spoilers""",1459641600,5,2230,4.648101265822785

3747358,3,B001PIHP2M,"Not a bad ""survival"" movie, of the man vs nature variety, but a lousy ""bear"" movie, of the man vs bear type. The DVD cover/poster is very misleading. We only see the bear for about 5 minutes tops, at the end of the movie during the last 10 minutes or so. The bear jumps out of some brush, scares our hero and then chases our hero for several scenes. The last time we see any reference to the bear, the bear is off-screen in the brush, growling menacingly and our hero is about to enter said brush armed with his lucky jackknife (with a full 3 1/2 inch blade). Next scene, our hero exits said brush, with said jackknife in hand, bloodied, clothes tattered, etc., leading us to conclude that he single-handedly finished off the bear with said jackknife. A couple of minutes later, the helicopter shows up and rescues our hero. But overall, this flick was not as bad as I am making its sound. It had some interesting characters and moved along at a good pace. All in all, it was a decent survival movie.",1456531200,,1000,4.352941176470588

3747361,2,B001PIHP2M,"I went into this movie expecting a low budget film with maybe some decent action scenes.  It was a low budget film.  The two that played the hunters were somewhat believable at times.  Could a couple of guys go into the wilderness completely unprepared?  Sure.  People do stupid things, and need to be rescued.  If you aren't careful, the Montana backcountry can be a dangerous place. The storyline made some sense in that respect.  What didn't make sense was one of the main characters. The actor that played ""Carl"" stretched the limits of believability, and his waistband throughout the entire movie.  In several scenes, the act of standing in an office is enough to make him sweat profusely.  I half expected him to pass out mid sentence during one of his monologues.  We're supposed to think that he could hike in the Montana mountains with a pack for any distance at all?  I'm inclined to believe that riding a desk would max out his physical ability.  But in all seriousness, Carl was super fat.

  Some other thoughts?  Why would you make a movie that prominently displays a grizzly on the cover art, and includes it as a major part of the storyline, when the bear appears in maybe 2-3 minutes of the film?  Also, it didn't show up until you're an hour into the film.

 Keep your expectations low, and you might like this as a ""background"" movie.  I made the mistake of giving it my undivided attention.",1454371200,,1410,4.608870967741935
3747362,1,B001PIHP2M,Sorry this is my kind of movie scenery and wildlife. However it wasn't very good. Independent and cheaply made. Scenes didn't flow and made you feel as if you had stepped out of the room and come back having missed something. Montana is my favorite state but because it was so poorly made you couldn't really enjoy the beauty. Sorry Casey love the wildlife stuff you do usually but this wasn't very good.,1453161600,,404,4.5479452054794525

8333356,4,B001PIHP2M,"Late nite good movie, with awsome scenery. Acting was great considering it was residents of Montana where it was filmed. I did not expect much of a plot the way it started out. However the things that happened can really happen. A lot of people find fault with the lack of what should happen like the lost city guy should have thought to signal with his gun, and hug a tree(such as i was thinking) but those things aside it was a good story with a heart felt ending for those that can see the selfless meaning of ""being a hero.",1516752000,,527,4.227722772277228

So you can fast forward to the last ten minutes, because nothing happens whatsoever, until then. Watch this movie if you have more than an hour of your life to get rid of. Otherwise, it was a fantastic film and you should watch it. Great acting, super thrilling plot with twists every which way, and a lot of moving platitudes that everyone, especially America's young people, need to listen to and learn! My first review was completely different and got rejected so I think this one is about as generic as a person like myself could make it. I love everyone. I accept everything.
