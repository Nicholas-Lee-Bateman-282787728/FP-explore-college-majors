8265141,4,B00176X7VK,"It's pretty bad but it is funny. And if you like Rutger Hauer he is good in this. Not a bad storyline, dirty comedy. Not to bad, quite silly.",1522886400,,141,3.896551724137931
8265142,3,B00176X7VK,"As noted by another reviewer, the cover image and title shown are completely unrelated to the actual movie.  This is a fairly faithful adaptation of Outsider in Amsterdam, by Janwillem van de Wetering.  Faithful, at least, in terms of characters and plot points, within the time constraints of the movie.  What is almost entirely missing is what makes van de Wetering's books so enjoyable--the character portraits, psychological motivations and comments on society.  Still, for a movie, it was interesting enough that I don't feel that I lost an hour and a half of my life watching it.  The dubbing is pretty bad--for instance, characters make frequent references to ""dollars"" and the ""IRS"" as if these were relevant concerns in The Netherlands.  Note also that, being a Dutch film, it does not shy away from nudity or gore.  I would certainly recommend the book over this film, but the film is an amusing curiosity.",1516147200,,916,4.947712418300654
8265143,1,B00176X7VK,"This is confusing. The cover and title are from another movie actually titled ""Fatal Error"". This, however, is the Dutch police procedural ""Grijpstra en de Gier"" based on one of the popular novels with these characters by Janwillem van de Wetering. I saw it when I was in the Netherlands and enjoyed it. These were the days when Rutger Hauer got second billing under the popular (in the Netherlands) comedic actor Rijk de Gooyer. Not a masterpiece, but in the theater I liked it. Here it is fuzzy, badly dubbed (no Dutch soundtrack), and badly cropped. Altogether a mess.",1467331200,,571,4.777777777777778
8265144,2,B00176X7VK,"This version is dsappointing for two reasons:

a) The image quality is very poor
b) Rhere are no language options - this version of an originally Dutch film is provided with an American-English soundtrack only (highly incongruous, given that it's set in Amsterdam).

Anyone looking for the Dutch original ""Grijpstra & De Gier"" should search elsewhere.",1271462400,3,351,5.25
