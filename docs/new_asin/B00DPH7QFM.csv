5841194,5,B00DPH7QFM,".... of the master. First off, I was very impressed with the technical quality of this DVD. The only quibble I would raise is the sound editing was a little off in places (guitar too loud, keyboards too soft, etc.). Very good overall, tho, and the video was excellent.

From an artistic point of view, this performance strengthened my opinion that Blackmore is the greatest pure rock guitarist ever. Blues players like Gary Moore and SRV, soul-less speed fanatics like most of the young ones, pyrotechnics experts like Hendrix and Van Halen........... none of them measure up to Ritchie. Nor do any of them have his mastery of such a wide range of styles (even more obvious now, with the totally different stuff he is doing with Blackmore's Night - at 65 years of age!). And don't EVEN mention Clapton. He hasn't done anything worth listening to since Blind Faith and D&D.

One sad thing, tho, is that this Rainbow line-up worked really well backing Ritchie up, and he appeared to be having fun, too. He even almost grinned a couple of times! Almost, but not quite........... ;-). I thought Doogie White was a wonderful choice as vocalist. Some people seem to think there is somebody out there who can mimic Gillan, Dio AND Coverdale, and that ain't gonna be. By this time, tho, October of 1995, Ritchie was pretty well burned out on R&R (he'd been doing it since the early 1960s), and was ready for something new - enter Candace. Personally, I welcome Blackmore's Night as a great new chapter in the Master's career, but this final version of Rainbow might have been really good if it had lasted a bit longer.",1378080000,18,1610,4.665492957746479
5841195,5,B00DPH7QFM,Had seen this concert posted in bits on YouTube and was really happy with the transfer and sound that made it onto this DVD.  This concert features songs from Rainbow's Stranger In Us All (their last) which I've always felt was one of their best.  Saw this tour when they stopped at the Key Club in Hollywood CA and this concert DVD really brings it all back.  Highly recommended!!,1377993600,2,381,4.492753623188406

5841197,4,B00DPH7QFM,"This is a DVD of a 1995 concert in Dusseldorf, Germany by Ritchie Blackmore and the last incarnation of Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow. It is part of the long running Live At Rockpalast concert series produced for German TV.

All the best known Rainbow tracks are here along with Perfect Strangers, Burn and Smoke On The Water from Blackmore's Deep Purple days.

Ritchie Blackmore is in fine form and it is quite likely this DVD is from the latest time period in which you'll see Blackmore playing this material. With his current band, Blackmore's Night, he's taken a totally different musical direction than his Deep Purple and Rainbow days. With his new band, Ritchie Blackmore no longer plays Deep Purple or Rainbow material. (* September 2013 Update to Original Post: I take back this comment about Ritchie Blackmore not playing Rainbow material anymore. The latest Blackmore's Night CD has a cover of ""Temple Of The King"" *)

The sound on this DVD is good; the video looks good and the camera work is good, although the video editing, in a few places, contains a few too many fast cuts for my taste. On a few occasions, the stage lighting has strobes which detract from the visual.

The keyboard player in this incarnation of Rainbow is very good. His keyboard solo is impressive.

On the downside, the singer in this version of Rainbow is good but IMHO is not up to the standard of Ronnie James Dio, the original vocalist in Rainbow. On the Deep Purple material, he's not at the standard of Ian Gillan or David Coverdale either. I know I'm at odds with some other reviewers on this but, to my ear, Ronnie James Dio, Ian Gillan (in his prime) and David Coverdale (during his Deep Purple days) top the vocalist in this incarnation of Rainbow.

But overall, this is a very worthwhile DVD for any Deep Purple or Rainbow fan. Ritchie Blackmore is in fine form and, since Blackmore no longer plays this material, this is likely to remain the latest DVD of Blackmore playing Rainbow and Deep Purple music in concert.

I see Amazon's page for this DVD does not include the set list, so here it is:

5841198,4,B00DPH7QFM,"First of all while the description on Amazon says nothing about this, but the DVD credits state that the picture and sound have been restored! (They even name the individual who did it) This can be confirmed by watching the DVD! Much better resolution than the boots circulating for all these years. So, picture and sound are excellent! (although remember this was 20 plus years ago) DTS Surround is no revelation but is reasonable. You will not be dissappointed in those elements. That said, for anyone who's never seen this show there is some odd strobe lights that are a little annoying and contribute to a bit of a busy effect visually. Surely it was impressive live, but on DVD it's a little bit irksome during the first few tunes. The sound mix is close to perfect.

The camera work is good throughout though..no quick MTV style editing. Patient and reasonable with the camera edits.

I must say Doogie White is spot on vocally. *Another reviwer took issue for my praise of White's performance here. One can be nostalgic about Rainbow vocalists, as they all had their moments, but it is intellectually unfair to compare Doogie to Ian Gillan and David Coverdale. Doogie represents Rainbow at this time, not twenty years earlier! How would Coverdale or Gillan do on ""Ariel""? or the songs from this era? (For me there's a big difference here from watching Ian Gillan struggle with notes and reading lyrics off the floor many years earlier on ""Hell or High Water"" dvd!) ""Hunting Humans"", ""Ariel"", and ""Black Masquerade"" make my point and tell the story of Doogies capabilities on the DVD.

The keyboardist Paul Morris is amazing. Rainbow has had some great keyboard players but this guy towers over David Stone in an improvisational sense. Watching Stone do his solo spot on the Munich DVD is sad. I always liked Tony Carey for his sound and aggressive style and Don Airey as well, but Morris is really good.

The bassist Greg Smith is excellent on this ,and is the best backup singer Rainbow ever had. (by far)

Blackmore plays well but really takes it up a couple notches by ""Temple of the King."" After that he gets significantly more inspired and plays amazing! Especaiily on ""Black Masquerade"" and ""Ariel."" *There are no long drawn out guitar solo segments like the intros on the Munich DVD.

No extras with the DVD but it is a great long set! (Thus the 4 stars) * Would love to have seen the Japanese TV footage of Doogie and Blackmore with the acoustic guitar doing a promo for the album. That would have been a great bonus feature. If you haven't seen this you really should check it out- really cool!>

[...]

I have no regrets in buying this. I highly reccomend this to any Blackmore fan. Thank you for releasing it and please continue the Deluxe Edition Rainbow CD's!

(Two flaws..there is no ""sixteenth century greensleeves."" There's kind of a joke version of Greensleeves about drinking but not at all like the album version so don't count on that.) Also there is a snippet of extraneous audio that creeeps in almost as if the into tape re-fires, but it only lasts like 20 seconds so it's not really that big a deal. Kind of sounds like someone turning on a tv in the backgroud while your watching. Short issue. * I don't recommend judging this DVD by listening to the CD of the show. They recently released a CD version and the problem is that this has show has a very live mix to it. It's ROCKPALAST people! Not exactly stet of the art! I think people are doing DVD reviews here having only listened to the audio. It doesn't hold together well as a CD.",1377648000,48,3568,4.606299212598425

5841227,5,B00DPH7QFM,"You know, I really don't understand why when a band makes certain personnel changes, some fans feel the need to then hate on the band for continuing as if they feel that if they continue to like the band with new members it means they will then have to dislike the previous version(s) of the band. Here's a thought, why not like both?

For those that don't know, Rainbow is guitarist Ritchie Blackmores baby. Blackmore left Deep Purple for the sole purpose to form his own band so that he could have complete control and play the music he so desired to play without having to butt heads with other members of the band. Matter of fact, the first two albums released had Ritchies name as part of the name of the band (the first album was called Ritchie Blackmores Rainbow, and the second called Blackmores Rainbow Rising).

The first edition/line-up of Rainbow recruited for the first album was the entire band Elf, minus their guitarist. Blackmore wanted vocalist Ronnie James Dio in his band, and felt to get him he had to hire the entire band Dio was part of at the time. However, as soon as the record was finished, Blackmore ditched the entire band except for Dio, and brought in three new players, Jimmy Bain, Cozy Powell, and Tony Carey (some feel this was the best line-up the band ever had) to take on the road (and then to record the follow-up album, Rising).

It wasn't until the third (fourth if you count On Stage, the live offering from the Rising tour) album, Long Live Rock N Roll (and yet another change in line-up) that Blackmores name was dropped from the bands name, and they were simply called Rainbow.

At this stage, the only two original players in Rainbow were Ritchie Blackmore and Ronnie James Dio. But that soon changed after the release of Long Live Rock N Roll, when Dio left/was fired from the band (depends on whose story you choose to believe), causing yet another dramatic change in the bands line-up, and splitting fans right down the middle on where they stood on liking/disliking the band.

And, of course, as history shows, the continuous changes in line-ups didn't stop there, and kept going on from album to album. But, as I said at the start of my review, any true fan of this band shouldnt let that cloud their judgement of (or distract them from liking) the band, because it was always Ritchie Blackmores band from the very beginning.

And if one listens to Rainbow in that aspect, then they can more than likely enjoy every single one of their albums. I know I sure have! Matter of fact, Rainbow is my favorite band, second only to Black Sabbath.

Now, unfortunately I didn't hear about the album this tour was taken from until just a couple years ago, which ironically kind of made it perfect timing because not too much later this live DVD came out. I am one that loves every single album the band has recorded, and appreciates and admires every single line-up change the band has experienced. And, frankly, I think this is yet another grand milestone in Rainbow/Blackmores career.

Too bad this came out during a time when grunge (no offense to that music genre, because it is one I also like a lot) was more of less the norm, because music like this was kind of pushed to the side and ignored, treated more like an unwanted red-headed step child

And what a shame, because this is Rainbow at the top of their game! Blackmore recruited an entire new line-up of virtually unknown musicians, and had resurrected his band from the brink of the grave and came back with a vengeance.

Im not going to waste my (or your) time comparing and despairing how vocalist Doogie White sounds next to former vocalists like Ronnie James Dio, Graham Bonnet, or Joe Lynn Turner (or even Ian Gillan and David Coverdale of Deep Purple since there are some DP songs in the set). All I will say is that White does a phenomenal job! He has lots of power and emotion in his voice and performance, and takes the stage with lots of authority.

This is a band and a performance that Blackmore can (and should) be very proud of. And too bad this only lasted for this album and tour, because I would have loved for Blackmore to have continued on with Rainbow instead of quitting to make the music he is making now.

Although I would say that the lyrics to ""Ariel"" are kind of sappy.  But Blackmore's classical influences make his solos a lot more interesting than shred.  Malmsteen should listen in and learn some lessons.  Was surprised to find out that ""smoke on the water""  is a Beethoven inversion.

5841235,4,B00DPH7QFM,"Let's face it, we don't get a Rainbow CD to see Doogie White sing. We get it to see Ritchie. And this is the best I've seen him play. Thi version of Rainbow was pretty dang good. A pleasing amount of Rainbow hits and misses and Deep Purple classics. The album they were touring on was STRANGER IN US ALL, the last Rainbow album, so those songs are a litte obscure here. It was, I thought, an underappreciated album.

Doogie White is a more than able vocalist, in fact probably the best to have toured under the Rainbow name. He does well on the old Rainbow stuff, and shines on ""Burn"" and ""Perfect Strangers"" from Blackmore's Deep Purple past. You also get a dose of Ritchie's then girlfriend and later musical collaborater during ""Ariel,"" which is the best of the ""new"" material.

Blackmore's tone and articulation are what set him apart. He pulls from rock, classical, and other modes and incorporates them seemlessly into his playing. I find even if I don't like the song (""Spotlight Kid"" for example) I can still marvel at his playing. In fact, the entire band is incredibly tight.",1391040000,,1085,4.587628865979381

5841241,5,B00DPH7QFM,"""Black Masquerade"" is an excellent concert film of Rainbow's 1995 appearance in Dusseldorf for the legendary Rockpalast TV program...The sound is amazing and the film is clear and well-shot with thankfully long, lingering camera shots (i.e., it does not look like some goofy music video-style film crammed with frantic, quick edits.)

Ritchie Blackmore has made a career of surrounding himself with amazing talent, many of whom were relatively unknown when they played with him. This version of Blackmore's Rainbow is no exception. Singer Doogie White is just terrific...he interprets Dio, Bonnet and Turner with ease and grace and presents the then new Rainbow material with a delicate, yet natural, style. White has a strong voice, good range and a lovely pure tone. While he may not have the dramatic and forceful persona of Ronnie James Dio, he is a terrific natural performer. Although vocally they are White's equal, as a performer, I prefer White to Turner or Bonnet.

The rest of the band is great as well. What may surprise you is that Blackmore is playing better than ever. His guitar tone is the thick strat tone found on ""Stranger in Us All"" which, if you are unfamiliar with that record, most closely resembles his tone on Deep Purple's ""Perfect Strangers"" record. Thankfully, the weird octaver sounds of the later Turner-era Rainbow concerts is gone. He is clearly very inspired in this ensemble and plays beautifully throughout this set.

Good set list as well. Almost half the set is new material which sounds even better live than on the record.  ""Ariel"" is epic and powerful, as is ""Black Masquerade"". The 1975 classic ""Temple of the King"" is reinterpreted and performed beautifully. ""Perfect Strangers"" is surprisingly good here as well. I would have loved to see them perform ""Gates of Babylon"" or ""Self-Portrait"" with this ensemble, but it was not to be. What we have is an excellent, perhaps final document of Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow...it is a fine end to a powerful and influential band.

5841244,4,B00DPH7QFM,"Following Blackmore's departure from Deep Purple in 1993, Ritchie put together a new Rainbow lineup, recorded a fine album (Strangers In Us All) and hit the road. The album didn't sell and within fairly short order Rainbow was folded, with Ritchie opting to form Blackmore's Night with his wife Candice. Blackmore's Night plays medieval renaissance music in traditional acoustic form, which meant Ritchie basically put the Strat into mothballs. Bit of a shame, really, because Black Masquerade finds Blackmore displaying his hard rock technique with a level of ability as strong as it ever was. I'd be disingenuous to claim this was Rainbow's most distinctive lineup: Paul Morris and Greg Smith execute their keyboard and bass parts with competence. Chuck Burgi is technically a fine rock drummer. None of them are likely to be known beyond avid Blackmore fan circles, mostly because they are (as mentioned) competent yet non-distinctive. Doogie White, much like the rest of the band, is technically quite good: as a singer, it's a pretty tall order to essay tunes from such noted vocalists as Ronnie James Dio, David Coverdale and Ian Gillan - along with Graham Bonnet and Joe Lynn Turner - and be able to pull it off. White does, although his voice is almost a bit too flawless and smooth for my tastes if that makes any sense. Not a lot of individual character. The main attraction here is Blackmore, and while I'd agree the bass and keyboards are a bit too low in the mix, for me this was kind of a plus (I mean, are people really buying this on the strength of Paul Morris and/or Greg Smith performing?). It's just good to have what, as another reviewer mentioned, was a fairly well-circulated (in Rainbow fan circles, anyway) show cleaned up and made available for release, as I'd also readily agree with that same reviewer that this release is in far superior condition than any of the bootlegs in circulation. I suppose casual rock fans might say that since this isn't one of the definitive Rainbow lineups the dvd isn't an essential release, and I suppose were I a casual rock fan I'd agree. However, I'm a fairly avid Blackmore fan, and the show was professionally shot, has a good mix, demonstrates Blackmore in excellent form with a highly competent backing group and has a good deal of better known Rainbow and Deep Purple songs alongside the Strangers In Us All material. Well worth it considering it's less than $20.",1382486400,3,2431,4.818181818181818

The performance is nicely edited, with good coverage of the band.  The crucial element is that the mercurial Blackmore is engaged, amiable, animated, and in tip top form, making for an ideal concert experience, which should be appreciated by most fans.  At magical moments, Ritchie's fingers seem to dance off the scalloped frets of his Stratocaster.

In addition to Blackmore, the band features singer Doogie White, Paul Morris on keyboards, Greg Smith on bass, and Chuck Burgi on drums, with Candice Night providing additional vocals.  With the exception of Burgi, the same personnel recorded The Stranger in Us All, and the album is very well represented in this performance.

White is a powerful singer, with good stage presence.  He really shines on the Strangers material, and his voice also seems suited to the Dio and Turner era Rainbow songs.  He doesn't seem to be quite as good, on the Deep Purple material, but he does a fine job overall.  At various times, Paul Morris steps up and impresses with some inspired playing, that complements Blackmore in a fashion somewhat reminiscent of the way Jon Lord did in Purple.

Selections from The Stranger In Us All include, ""Wolf To the Moon"", ""Black Masquerade"", ""Still I'm Sad"", ""Ariel"", ""Hunting Humans"", ""Too Late For Tears"", and the epic ""Hall Of The Mountain King"".  The band really seems to be going for the throat performing the new material, and Blackmore appears to be particularly engaged and animated.

The setlist also includes ""Spotlight Kid"", ""Man On The Silver Mountain"", a medley of ""Long Live Rock 'n' Roll"" and ""Black Night"", a sedate version of ""Temple Of The King"", and a medley of ""Since You've Been Gone"" and ""Perfect Strangers"".  The performance closes strongly, with ""Burn"", and ""Smoke On The Water"".

Ritchie Blackmore has since turned to performing renaissance music, with his wife Candice Night in Blackmore's Night.  This appearance by Rainbow on Rockaplast, could be one of the last recorded performances by the Man in Black, in the hard rock genre, for some time to come.  Presenting the band in a most favorable light, this performance should certainly not to be missed, by any fan of this incarnation of Rainbow.",1381708800,,2806,5.350797266514807

5841247,4,B00DPH7QFM,"Rainbow without RJD, isn't really Rainbow. Having said that, this is the last incarnation with Doogie White singing, touring promoting the last studio effort, Stranger In Us All, which is pretty decent album, but without the edge and power. This is the slicked down version, which to say it isn't bad, or should I say horrible, it is Ritchie Blackmore, enough said there. He plays brilliantly, the band is on. This is a must have for Rainbow fans and fans for all and everything Ritchie Blackmore. I had to have it, couldn't have gone on another day without it, but I am ate up.",1381622400,,578,4.5673076923076925
5841248,1,B00DPH7QFM,"very mediocre show.  away from Ritchie Blackmore's guitar playing, nothing much here.  Where is bobby and Joe?  or Even Ronnie?
not enough of the classic Rainbow on the CD and candace night is in the credit, but where is she on the video?
This is a masquerade all right of an imitation of an once superb band lead by Ritchie Blackmore.",1381449600,,335,4.459016393442623
5841258,5,B00DPH7QFM,I have been waiting for this concert to come to dvd for a long time and it did not disappoint. Ritchie is at his best. I like other Blackmore fans wish he would give us just one more heavy guitar album.,1381104000,,202,3.951219512195122
5841259,5,B00DPH7QFM,"I purchased the cd when I bought the dvd to get both. this is a decent like album
where Ritchie plays pretty good, and the whole band seems to work well!!!
I'd recommend it to die-hard rainbow fans like myself!!!!",1380758400,,213,4.35
5841260,5,B00DPH7QFM,"Im sorry but  i cant see in my Dvd this this concert. I don't know why. The screen say ""wrong region code""",1380672000,,106,3.8181818181818183
5841261,2,B00DPH7QFM,"This would be a fine product if only the mix wasn't so terrible. Some inept or unqualifed undividual was allowed to mix this and he left the guitar and vocals way too loud. Mr. Blackmore remains my favorite guitar player ever and he is probably brilliant here IF HEARD WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE BAND. Knowing Blackmore the band most cetainly played well and the guitar noise on this DVD would be music if I could here what it was set to. Borrow this or listen on line if you are curious. Did anybody even bother to check the quality of this before it was released? If this is ""archival material"" that couldn't be fixed then that is how this should have been marketed. Joel R. Tambling",1380672000,,684,4.393700787401575
5841262,5,B00DPH7QFM,"Now I believe I understand why Blackmore put a halt to playing hard rock music after viewing this DVD of ""Black Masquerade"" with his last assembled group of ""Rainbow.""  In my opinion, he realized that it could never get any better than this, and the challenge was simply removed. The show here is just superb in so many aspects that there just aren't enough superlatives in my vernacular to properly address an adequate description.

People say that Blackmore is a ""rough', hard-to-get-along with guy.  He certainly does make life difficult for many people in his professional involvements on a high profile level by what I have read, and seen, (Hell or High Water),etc.  I am sixty years old, and have followed hard rock for decades, particularly guitarists, and NOBODY,
(not Stevie Ray, Malmsteen, Page, Beck, Satriani, Van Halen, Allmans, or any other that come to mind), can play this instrument with such amazing qualities such as grace note selections, enhancement choices, and flat out MELODY as this ""hard to get along with"" guy! NOBODY!!  I have listened to all his live stuff like ""The Final Concerts"" for years and it never fail to be ""blown Away"" by his mastery of the six strings.  But, I have said enough about Blackmore.

This Dougie White guy is just the best vocalist RB has had since Cloverdale/Hughes, and maybe as good as Gillan in his prime, and that's saying something!  Taking nothing away from Bonnet, Turner, and Dio, (who I didn't particularly care for because his voice was too reminiscent of Plant's, or Byron to suit me.)  This guy interprets Gillan's lyrical masterpiece ""Perfect Strangers"" in a manner that really presents this great song in the way it deserves to be sang.  This is the highlight of the show for me, though every song here keeps you riveted to your seat!

The players all seem to remind me of ""top studio"" guys, all masters of their instruments, and exceptionally knowledgeable of current progressive rock techniques of performance.  Yes, the bassist cannot be heard as well as the others in the mix, I give that, but when you finally convince yourself that he doesn't much matter to this show, he sings the Hughes part in the obligatory ""Smokey Waters"" at he end, and MAN! He can flat sing!

The keyboard guy channels Jon Lord on the Purple standards, but like Don Airey, he builds upon the structures of the songs, making his performance unique.  When he plays the new ""Stranger in Us"" material; this guy simply SOARS beyond basic keyboard work! He mesmerizes the listener with articulate dexterity that seemed to even make Blackmore ""jealous"" at one point!

Solid drummer, great drummer slightly reminiscent of Paice in the middle seventies,(or Today!), but a bit slicker, I think.  I believe Rondinelli could have handled this material, but not any better than the new guy!

The show comes off, literally, like a theatrical, Shakespearian presentation in a festival setting.  It is very fast-moving, always presenting little ""surprises"" within the music, with exceptional choreography for a rock show.  Every word, (or facial expression), seems to service the song at hand, and is perfectly placed to accentuate the moment for the camera. The two, or three thousand attendees in the audience, (primarily Germans I imagine) seem very entertained.  [Europeans, particularly eastern Europeans are well versed in quality music, and are not as easy to please as Americans as a rule I understand.]  But, here, at this show, they get what they came for in spades.  The new songs that are played must just be the best songs on ""Stranger"", (I have not heard any of this record before this how), because this material is consistently excellent.  One called ""Insatiable"", another called ""Ariel"" are stunning.  Like I said earlier, there isn't a dead moment in the show.

I once received an email from a guy that attended one of the Blackmore Night shows a few years ago, and he said that when the cameras are turned off, Blackmore comes out and spends a lot of time with the guys that try to just talk to him after the show, ..fans that just want a moment.  This guy told me in his email message that Blackmore was as polite, and reasonably interesting as he probably could be; answering old Purple questions, & whatever else he was asked.  I don't know how ""nice"" he is, I don't want to marry him!  I just want to say that this show is so good that it is very hard to come up with another rock concert DVD made in the last thirty years to rival it.  It ain't just Blackmore, it is this wonderful experience of watching/listening to this bunch of artists doing these songs, (including ""Burn""!), in front of this audience, I think! I don't regret buying the DVD, (I usually just rent shows, but couldn't wait for this one to be released for rental.)",1379462400,21,4789,4.784933171324423
5841263,5,B00DPH7QFM,"I originally bought this DVD because it was listed as a PAL version from the german amazon site. This has since been updated to NTSC. So I assume there is no PAL version at all. I wish the different site would indicate correctly in future. Back to this DVD, I am happy with the picture quality and the music quality has been upgraded to 5.1 surround sound. I made comparison to the bootleg that has been around since day one. Ritchie's playing and Doogie's vocal were incredible good and without dubbing, this is a fantastic dvd. To Rainbow fans, this is a follow-up to ""Stranger In Us All"".",1379030400,3,591,4.481481481481482
5841264,3,B00DPH7QFM,"If you're a fan from the 70's then this release may get you excited. while it is a true treat to see Ritchie on stage and bringing back the Rainbow sounds, what is missing? Sorry Doogie, it's Ronnie James Dio and the lack of shows how much fire and stage prescence Dio really delivered. I'm not going to whine and complain, it's a fair attempt at bringing back the passion of those years and a touch of Deep Purple, but it just falls a bit short.  Good for a view I will say that, but not archive.",1379030400,2,497,4.123711340206185
5841265,2,B00DPH7QFM,"I have been a fan of Ritchie since the 70's. The first album I ever purchased was Machine Head, Deep Purple.
Ritchie was the main reason I started to follow Purple, Rainbow and now, Blackmore's Night.
When I ordered this DVD, I didn't clue in to the fact that it was a recording from 1995, otherwise the purchase would not have happened. Don't get me wrong, Blackers and his fellow musicians are in fine form, Doogie White is a great singer, but having him trying to pull off songs written by, and intended for, the likes of Gillan, Coverdale and in particular, the great Ronnie James Dio, just does not work. I fast forwarded through this DVD to get an idea of what I may have to listen to and watch, it may be a while before I can actually stomach sitting through the whole thing without fast forward.
If you're a Ritchie fan, absolutely buy the DVD. If you're a Rainbow fan ..... don't. Buy the 1977 Live in Munich DVD instead. If you don't already own it.",1378944000,7,959,4.363128491620111
5841266,3,B00DPH7QFM,I pretty much agree with everything that's been said already by others. My question though is where's the low end? I've played this disc on 2 different setups and the bass is lacking in both. Even after adjusting the EQ and tweaking the subwoofer the kick drum and bass guitar are mostly AWOL.,1378598400,2,293,4.547169811320755
5841267,5,B00DPH7QFM,This is a great representation of this ERA of Blackmore's career! Doogie White was a fitting vocalist for Rainbow in this time! Like I ready here already they play with great energy. Highly recommend this show!,1378512000,3,210,4.861111111111111

8595827,4,B00DPH7QFM,"A lot has been written already. In a few words, Doogie White is not my preferred singer. Ronnie James Dio was unique, the best. The rest of the band is OK, but don't hope to find the magic of ""Munich 1977"". Back to Doogie White, his voice is very light in the first thirty minutes but deepens as the concert goes, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3. Ritchie is himself, though does not seem as confident or pleased  as he is in Munich 1977. The footage is good considering the age of the concert. At the end, if you like Rainbow, get this DVD, ""Burn"" alone is worth the purchase, but it will not be in the DVD player as much as other Rainbow's DVD's.",1512604800,,659,4.069230769230769
8595828,5,B00DPH7QFM,"If you're a Ritchie Blackmore fan it's a no-brainer. His playing is impeccable. Nobody else I know plays like he does. The band is awesome. Everyone comes through in spades, especially the lead singer. The song selection is good, although I do wish they had played Stargazer. All in all a great concert. Wish they had stuck with it for another album and concert tour but not to be. No surprise there. Blackmore has always followed his muse and you can't blame him for that. Just appreciate what we do get. And I say get this you won't regret it.",1504569600,,545,4.46

This is one of those rare live performances in which the band's drive, intensity and professionalism created a perfect synergy. There's also a spontaneity to the entire set and Doogie's energetic stage antics add a visual fun factor. This band rocks.  Regardless of the band's history and various lineups, the bottom line here is this DVD features a tight band on a great night.  The ""Perfect Strangers"" rendition here is killer.
