2516721,5,B000EDWLMS,This was a gift for my husband. He was thrilled and surprised. The quality was terrific.,1186358400,,88,4.5625
2516722,5,B000EDWLMS,"The quality of this series is terrific.  A little raunchy, but very funny.  Right up there with Futurama, Family Guy, The Simpsons, and American Dad.  Enjoy some good laughs.",1185840000,,174,4.931034482758621
2516723,5,B000EDWLMS,Everything I expected and much more. Highly unique and extremely funny story lines. Very interesting mix of characters ala Futurama. This was the topping to my Season ONE and I long for more that probably will not come....DON'T PASS THIS UP,1180396800,,240,4.878048780487805

2516727,4,B000EDWLMS,"After really enjoying season one of tripping the rift, i was

pleasently surprised that season two is as good. The scripts are

good and funny, the characters as crazy as before and once the disk

was in the machine...i couln't stopped watching till the season was

over.  Cant wait for season 3...bring it on.",1146096000,12,310,4.666666666666667

2516734,3,B000EDWLMS,"I've seen other episodes of Tripping the Rift and they're great, but this one was pretty stupid.",1448582400,,96,4.705882352941177
2516735,5,B000EDWLMS,This is hilarious....its funny on its own or as a satire of other scifi shows.  great for a party marathon watching night.,1440720000,,122,4.545454545454546

2516749,4,B000EDWLMS,"I understand that this was broadcasted on TV but why the censorship on the video? Enough satire, innuendo and adult humor but this is a DVD, and those of us adult enough know that, sometimes, vulgar and crude language is a form of expression. All in all, still pretty humorous!",1427241600,2,277,4.56

2516754,3,B000EDWLMS,Okay,1414627200,,4,4.0
2516755,4,B000EDWLMS,Great nonsense; I find this type of animation quite amusing. Most of the stories were well done although I thought some of the scenes were used more than once in different episodes.,1411430400,,181,4.6875
2516756,5,B000EDWLMS,Too cool,1409529600,,8,3.5

2516774,5,B000EDWLMS,So glad to finally have my own copy of this raunchy but lovable series. This series takes a hysterical romp through the anals (pun intended) of science fiction and takes no prisoners along the way.,1391040000,,197,4.6571428571428575
2516775,5,B000EDWLMS,"for adults only.it good I would buy it for my twin sister, she would love it. its not for old people.",1387584000,,101,3.857142857142857
2516776,5,B000EDWLMS,"I enjoy the different characters and plots. I'm always looking for something new to watch with an adult content, not for kids",1386201600,,125,4.7272727272727275
2516777,5,B000EDWLMS,I use to own it and I have no idea why I got ride of it.  The humor is a little outdated and it is very adult so no children should view this item.,1384387200,,147,3.323529411764706
2516778,5,B000EDWLMS,This was my fav series. I was saddened they took it off the air but so pleased now own the whole series. Haven't watched it yet but will soon,1376006400,,141,3.896551724137931

2516780,5,B000EDWLMS,"Although crude, this is a classic! The rips and take-offs on popular culture and it's icons are a scream! If you like crude humor, and are not easily offended, this is for you! Get all three seasons!!",1369872000,,200,4.4324324324324325
2516781,5,B000EDWLMS,lol tripping the rift is strate out lol funny i do not know how this was ever earded on tv but they where,1364601600,,105,3.608695652173913
2516788,3,B000EDWLMS,Don't believe anything they say... These DVDs are highly censored.  Every profanity has been bleeped out which actually makes them hard to watch because chode loves to drop the F bomb alot.,1364256000,8,189,4.90625
2516789,4,B000EDWLMS,"My review for the series can be found under the ""complete 1st season"", so I'm just going to talk about the packaging. I really like the 'box' format that matches so well the complete 1st season. The added 'tripping test' is a scream and the artwork is new. It sets well as a series collection addition to season one.
  BUT why oh why??!?!?!?! Did they CHEAP it by doing a 2-side DVD???  The art on disc one is so wonderful! I want 2 discs more of art! Doing a flip-disc is so cheap!",1363478400,2,482,4.161290322580645
2516790,4,B000EDWLMS,"The second season has slightly better graphics and more consistent stories than season 1. I enjoyed this season, which moves a faster clip than season 1. I have all 3 seasons and it's definitely a cult show. Recommended for followers only.",1363046400,,239,4.853658536585366

2516792,5,B000EDWLMS,"wish they would continue this series, i love it, it is funny and entertaining and just a little off kilter",1362528000,,106,4.35
2516793,5,B000EDWLMS,Some nice French Canadian Social comments. I love humor and in outer space all the better. The graphics are good but some of the sexual comments get a bit heavy. But keep an open mind and you will laugh.,1361318400,,203,4.230769230769231
2516794,5,B000EDWLMS,I really enjoy the Tripping the Rift Movies. This is another funny and entertaining movie is the series. I recommend it.,1360972800,,120,4.761904761904762
2516795,4,B000EDWLMS,very pleased - meet all expectations - didn't realise it's censored - I believe the rating would have to change for public sale?,1356480000,,128,4.608695652173913

2516797,5,B000EDWLMS,"The main characters are from different races but basicly a disfunctional family with a little bit of sleaze, all for your viewing pleasure. If you like extremely wack space advantures and like (or don't mind) a little sleaze than Tripping the Rift is probably for you",1300233600,,267,4.826086956521739

*Six is sooo Sexy if it wasn't for Six I wouldn't have like or love Tripping the Rift. My favorite episodes in Tripping the Rift: Season 2 are: 1, 2, 3, 12 and even 13.

2516801,3,B000EDWLMS,"I'd give this season an overall rating of ""B-""  Perhaps I had too high of expectations after the novelty factor of Season 1.  I won't be buying Season 3.",1264118400,,153,4.241379310344827
2516802,5,B000EDWLMS,"Wonderful series, many references to classic movies, series... books... its wonderful to find how the writers use references to many other series/movies and make fun of them in a strog adult context.
Strong references to Star Trek, Star wars, 2001 Space Oddisey.

It's really worth the trip!!!!",1252281600,5,294,5.25531914893617
2516803,5,B000EDWLMS,"Of course, The Rift is not at all profound. Or anything near sophisticated. Some may see this series as trash; well; it is trashy, but it's funny trashy. And unique and surprising. Even the CGI effects are surprisingly well-done. Just enjoy. Like. very well-designed, well-executed trash.

(Oh, this review relates to The Rift's Second Season. There's a movie, too, and a few more seasons.
I doubt there's every been a show like this on cable/satellite. Certainly not on broadcast TV. Are you
an adolescent or a grown-up terminal adolescent? This funny, surprising well-done Sci-Fi spoof is for you.) If you've got a trashy sense of humor you'll give it five stars too.",1249084800,,669,4.973214285714286
