8047093,5,B0007DFWVC,"No better way to teach a young kid how to read. Fran is such a sweetheart who will remind you of your school days if you are as old as I. For my son he became a first ""crush'. Was wonderful to watch him respond to all the cute lessons. However, if you are used to high tech film you'll have to prepare yourselves for the feeling of quite a step back in time. Sweet short lessons that open with the ringing of the ""school bell"".",1421366400,,427,3.9767441860465116
8047094,5,B0007DFWVC,I remember my grandmother sitting me down to watch this video time and time again. I wish that it was out on DVD so I could have my 6 year old watch it. Maybe it would be a good idea for someone to convert it somewhere down the line seeing as it was one of the best educational video's of its time.,1246233600,,298,3.8225806451612905
8047095,5,B0007DFWVC,"I am looking for this on DVD.  I used to put this in my 3 yr. old's VHS player when she wanted to watch T.V.  We didn't have regular television, only movies and learning videos.  When she didn't want to nap, I would say, ""ok, you can watch 'the lady'"".  I heard this tape from another room on and off for years (I have four children now).  That first child is now in 3rd grade, reading in the 6th grade classes.  I cannot get her to stop reading.  She even enjoys books such as the Mutant Message Down Under. Anyhow, I now live in Hawaii, where everything molds and I really want to find this on DVD.  I recommend this tape for 2-4 yr. olds (or any child who is learning their sounds or how the letters look).  Aloha",1203811200,,716,4.093525179856115
