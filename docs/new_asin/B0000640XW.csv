Formula 1 2001 is the year that saw the stars of the future which includes fernando alonso and kimi raikkonen had started their careers with minardi and sauber respectively. and also the arrival of the very fast columbian Juan Pablo Montoya who battled with the master schumacher all year long. it is also the year when finally BMW had come up with an engine capable of propeling the williams f1 team in the spotlight. most importantly its the year that saw michael schumacher win his 4th consecutive title. definitely, a video that should not be missed.",1185494400,,785,4.814814814814815
