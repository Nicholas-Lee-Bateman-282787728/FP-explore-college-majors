6493565,5,B00LNID1NQ,"Mr. Bugliosi (RIP) will get your blood boiling while you watch him prosecute these people. Some have said that we should look beyond these actions towards the future and not dwell in the past. I completely disagree. We should always require our leaders to be held accountable for their actions. Now that Mr. Bush is a civilian he can be prosecuted for his actions along with his cronies that helped him commit his and their crimes.
I'm sure that some would like to re-write history and say that he and his compatriots weren't accountable. Bugliosi proves them wrong with the brilliance of his investigation of the evidence. Murder in the first count. All it takes is one grand jury indictment, but who will have the guts to do it?",1420761600,11,730,4.666666666666667

6493569,4,B00LNID1NQ,"A provocative and compelling look at the reality of the Bush Administrations criminal actions perpetrated against the American People and the Iraqi People when he waged an absolutely unnecessary war against a people who genuinely did everything they possibly could to satisfy the United States Government and its allies as well as the UN that it had no Advanced Weapons nor did they possess any Weapons of Mass Destruction. The Documentary primarily focuses around the case for charging these men with multiple crimes based on the blatant lies and deceptions used to eventually Kill 4,500 American Service Men and Countless Iraqi Civilians in a war that was fought for one reason and one reason alone, MONEY. The evidence is irrefutable and there is no real argument that would defend the actions taken, yet there is no real call or outcry for Legal action against the most prolific Mass Murderers in modern history. Vincent Bugliosi, the LA County Prosecutor who successfully prosecuted Charles Manson and his followers, makes a strong and compelling case against George Bush and Dick Cheney and leaves the viewer with a desire for Justice for all of the innocent Americans who thought their President would never lie to them about something that was clearly a Life and Death issue, still believing that America is the Country that Stands For Truth and Justice. They found out that was all an illusion and the way they found the truth was by Dying in a War to make Billions for the people who already had Billions and Never Spent a Day in the Service of The United States of America. We see a clip that show George Bush speaking in front of a large Dinner Party and Fund Raiser, where he makes a long and very distasteful JOKE about ""where are the WMD's, they are not over here, they are not over there....and so on, This in itself indicates that he and his insiders knew damned well that the WMD Story was just that, A STORY. One that has cost well over a Million Lives, and for this there MUST BE JUSTICE if the United States is ever to be seen as the Country the Takes the Moral High Ground and stands for Truth and Justice and the Human Cause. We Cannot continue to shrug off the Crimes of these Men if we are to be considered The United States that fought to save the world during WWII, not if we do Nothing because we think that our one voice just won't make a difference, but the truth is that we must start Somewhere with Someone.",1417564800,20,2439,4.5963302752293576
6493570,5,B00LNID1NQ,"Great thinking and a fearless idea to prosecute Bush.  There are also some good interviews with expert attorneys.
It is clear that Bugliosi has researched the law and only needs one prosecutor to indict. This is a great documentary.",1417219200,4,232,4.948717948717949

6493572,5,B00LNID1NQ,"Buglioso is famous for his prosecution of Charles Manson, so this is no lightweight topic and neither is this examination of George W. Bush.  The film is organized, detailed and direct.  Although the film `Farenheight 9/11' was more colorful and focused on more areas, this film is directly dead-on towards the actions of President Bush and his cronies.

Carried through like a real law case, each chapter breaks down the progress and execution of all of Bush's decisions on the wars in the Middle East.  Providing more than ample proof that Bush is responsible for the deaths of more than 4,500 troops and over 100,000 innocent civilians, this is a brave but necessary documentary.

It tends to sometime dive into dryness, but the facts seem to be so overwhelming that it begs more questions about the rights of an American President.  Who is above the law?  Who is ultimately responsible?  IS George W. Bush one of the worst war criminals in recent history?  Was the American public really lied to in this degree?  Bugliosi provides ample evidence and I doubt this case will ever be dismissed.

This film was provided for an honest and fair review.",1410566400,26,1150,4.816326530612245

It transcends political parties, and ought to serve as a wake-up call that both parties need to scrutinized and held it check. In my humble opinion, the last 4 administrations have been incredibly corrupt, but proving that is another matter. This does so brilliantly. I'm a conservative, but justice must preempt the left/right political spectrum!!!",1428192000,,478,5.141025641025641

6493578,5,B00LNID1NQ,"An excellent documentary pointing out step by step why George W. Bush is indeed legally a wanted war criminal and should be prosecuted for murder. Of course this prosecution will never happen as powerful politicians in the U.S. are above the laws that define the decency of the rest of humanity - but it's still a chilling indictment of a man who had no business being the President of the United States and whose sole contribution to the American experience was to plunge us into a endless series of pointless, bloody wars while turning global opinion of us around from being the most respected nation in the world to the most reviled. If you are a law student or professor, I highly recommend you view this documentary as a companion to Bugliosi's original book - ""The Prosecution of George W. Bush For Murder"" which should be taught in every U.S. law school.",1427760000,6,861,4.671052631578948

6493582,5,B00LNID1NQ,"A compelling and rather frightening expose' about all the lies, misdirects, and deliberate maneuvering done by the Bush administration to justify Bush's determination to exterminate Saddam Hussein. I have always thought that this was the case, but to see it as clearly portrayed as this film does it, I was even more angry with the Bush Revenge War,as I call it. I wouldn't call this film entertainment, I would call it educational and a wake up call to the people of this country. Politicians lie. Not all of them, but take the time to consider the source and the agenda of all politicians before you believe them.",1421539200,5,615,4.757009345794392

8666918,5,B00LNID1NQ,"Brilliant! Thoughtful and focused. A Courageously Bold Expose` of Facts and Due Process. Vince Bugliosi once again justifies his significant notoriety for prosecutorial excellence and inscrutable credibility. The fact that this film has been categorically marked for apparent ""media blackout"" by large corporate media outlets serves to make it even more tantalizing fare to the general public seeking uncensored publication. Such media blackout undeniably attests to the magnitude of the subject matter, as well as the compelling power of Vince Bubliosi's thoughtful presentation. THE PROSECUTION OF AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT is a ""Must See"" film for all, and is certain to leave a profound impression. Fresh and satisfyingly entertaining. Thank You Jamal; Well Done!

8666922,4,B00LNID1NQ,"For those of us NOT blind to the disgusting ways of neo-Conservatism, the antics of the Bush administration come as no surprise. This video compliments Bugliosi's book: ""The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder"".

Once, mercifully, the Bush reign came to an end, laypeople like myself started taking stock of the mess he handed over to his successor. Two ongoing ""wars"", massive deficit, steadily climbing debt, economy in freefall, jobs shedding faster than a shaggy dog, low standing in the world and a polarized population were his legacy. I started to read about him.

I get the feeling, from all I read, Bush was just a useful idiot amongst a band of scheming, authoritarian neo-cons who viewed the presidency as their chance to shape and plunder the country to their own ends. George just doesn't seem smart enough some how. Well, given that every time he opened his mouth he shoved the country's foot in it along with shaving a few IQ points off everybody I feel I'm justified in making that statement. Rumsfeld, Cheney, Rove, Card, Libby, Wolfowitz et al. were the ones in the shadows nudging and patting George into place and he was their figurehead.

Despite my feelings for GWB, he's the man who must answer for Iraq. Without doubt he lied us into Iraq. Enough evidence exists that Rumsfeld, Cheney and Wolfowitz were looking to invade prior to Sept 11, 2001. Once the Twin Towers came down the White House had its excuse all they needed was the evidence. That's where George Tenet and Cheney got creative with various reports issued by the myriad defense agencies both foreign and domestic.

Despite the time gap between his book (2008) and this documentary (2014) Bugliosi is still very passionate in his articulation of why Bush is guilty and how he should be prosecuted for mass murder. I for one, agree whole heartedly with him as I already did before watching this documentary.

The DVD centers around Bugliosi presenting his case to a group of law students along with other footage of the carnage of Iraq. Also his senate hearing is played to the hoots and hollers of many in the crowd.

In summary, great documentary outlining the disgusting cabinet antics of one George W. Bush that led us into a war based on lies and greed that led to, in some estimates, over 1,000,000 innocent deaths.",1440547200,3,2312,4.7819548872180455
