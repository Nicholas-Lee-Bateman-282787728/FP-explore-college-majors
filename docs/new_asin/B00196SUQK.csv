8272185,3,B00196SUQK,There are some pretty good fights in there and a few from yet to be well known MMA stars. Buuut... 2 of the five discs froze and skipped repeatedly to the point where they're almost unwatchable.,1427932800,,194,4.416666666666667

8272187,2,B00196SUQK,"The main reason  I bought this ""RARE GEM"" was for the Silva vs Murray fight. My husband tried to find this Event/Fight for years, So me being a Good Wife, I found it and bought it. It would be the understatement of the year to say he was displeased/devestated!!! He cried for days!",1386979200,,281,4.30188679245283
8272188,5,B00196SUQK,"I love getting these sets, not only do you get a lot of fights for your money. You also get to see a lot of up and coming fighters who are big now fight when they were still a no-name or getting their name.",1368662400,,206,3.7045454545454546
8272189,1,B00196SUQK,"Save your money MMA fans, despite some great fights this dvd is unwatchable! It did not convert well from the european PAL to US format(ntsc). The result is about 4 frame per second and a nasty wobble. After about a minute my eyes hurt and after 5 I had a headache and shut it off. I am surprised EliteXC would release something of this quality.",1243814400,2,345,4.323076923076923
8272190,5,B00196SUQK,Really great value for this many events / fights.  Fun to watch some of these guys before they became huge stars.  Well worth your time.,1219622400,,136,4.4
8272191,2,B00196SUQK,"This DVD is nice to have for the amount of fights you get for the low price.  But most of the fights are of low quality featuring lesser known British fighters, who's skills are definitely not UFC/Pride quality.  The best part is seeing Anderson Silva and Michael Bisping in some of their earlier fights.  My biggest complaint is that the quality of the video is very poor.  It looks like it was filmed on a handheld camcorder.  Another problem is that the first two discs seem to be running at 1.5x speed.  I don't know why they did this but it is very annoying and the fighters' movements look very unnatural.  So I'd only recommend this to people that want to see Anderson Silva fight Lee Murray and Bisping knock around a few scrubs, but don't mind the low picture quality.  To me you're better off watching this on youtube because the quality is about the same.",1218844800,3,866,4.471337579617835
