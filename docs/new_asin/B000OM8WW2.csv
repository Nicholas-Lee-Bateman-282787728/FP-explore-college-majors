8325542,5,B000OM8WW2,"I purchased a Felix tape on ebay that was NOT suitable for my 6-year-old nephew and then came looking on Amazon.com.  This is a great tape.  You can show it to a 5 year-old or anyone.  If you remember ""the wonderful, wonderful cat"" like I do, you'll remember The Professor, Rock Bottom, Poindexter, The Master Cylinder, The Magic Bag, Vavoom, and the great adventures that made up part of my childhood.

Felix explains in the mode of ""Dora the Explorer,"" However, I think that Felix does it better.  Animation used to assume that children are intelligent or that they can learn.  Then animation got into adult uses, and went a different way entirely.  Then, animation came back with Japanese anime (from Speed Racer and Kimba the White Lion to adult soft porn) and computer generated images.

If you consider computer-generated images to be obscene and hard on the eyes, this Felix tape is for you.  Don't live in or for a virtual world.  I think this is a great tape to have in your library.",1243036800,,992,4.617142857142857
