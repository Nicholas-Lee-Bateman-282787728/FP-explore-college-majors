5647854,5,B00BMRTPEM,It's worth the money. If you have on demand it's free. It is a great series. I recommend watching it,1380672000,4,100,4.05
5647855,4,B00BMRTPEM,"Say what you will, it is a good depiction of the War of the Roses, and, most importantly, it is historically accurate, as opposed to ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" and the first installment of ""The Tudors"". Also, as opposed to the just mentioned movies, the casting is excellent. Elizabeth Woodville is beautiful, King Edward IV is tall, Richard III is short with dark hair, the Duke of Clarence is good looking and greedy, etc., and David Oakes does a fantastic job playing the latter character. The one miscast person so far, in my opinion, is the young Prince of Wales who gets killed at Tewkesbury.
The witchcraft thing is definitely overdone, even more so than in the first 3 books of the series. According to history, Jaqcuetta Woodville was accused of witchcraft twice, and had to defend herself against the accusations. She must have done so ably, as she was never convicted and died of an unspecified disease when she was in her late 50's.
I wished there had been more outdoor shots, as in The Tudors, which had beautiful outdoor scenery and lighting. Here, it seems various people ride through the same woods constantly, or towards the same castle. But that is the only beef I have. If you like the War of the Roses, you will enjoy this series. I do and I will buy it once it becomes available for purchase.",1379462400,7,1310,4.602564102564102
5647856,5,B00BMRTPEM,"I am addicted! After I viewed the first episode, I read everything I could find on the internet about Edward IV and Elizabeth.  I also ordered all three of Philippa Gregory's books in the series.  I have never been a history buff but the story of the War of the Roses is amazing!",1379289600,2,279,4.245283018867925
5647857,5,B00BMRTPEM,"Being an novice student of British history, I am always eager when any new show comes out relating to this topic.  While this is historical fiction it does follow history quite accurately.  The casting is phenomenal!  I will address some of the characters that really stood out for me.  I am NO authority these are just my opinions! :-)

Rebecca Ferguson portrays a brave and beautiful Queen Elizabeth.  Her performance is commanding and powerful.  She really portrays the strength and courage of her character during a very dangerous time in British history.

Amanda Hale presents viewers with a pious and scheming Lady Beaufort.  She does an excellent job of conveying her love for God and her son while showing the ugly side of greed and bad behavior.

Aneurin Barnard plays Richard Duke of Gloucester.  His character evolves from one that seems sweet and caring as the Duke however, when he becomes King Richard we see him transform  into power hungry and vile creature.

Max Irons as King Edward....I'm not sure about the casting with this actor.  While he does a good job acting, I don't feel that he physically fits the part.  Don't get me wrong he is very handsome he just doesn't fit the appearance of a King during the 1400's.  The portrayal of King Edward is one of a womanizer (which he was) but his real character was much richer than this.  I would have liked to see this developed more in the script.

David Oakes as George Duke of Clarence....PERFECT casting!  I can't see any other actor doing a better job!  He plays the jealous, conniving, backstabbing younger brother of King Edward with such conviction.

Janet McTeer as Jacquetta Woodville mother to Queen Elizabeth.  McTeer plays the mother figure with style and grace, portraying a character that is determined to see her daughter and family succeed.  The love that she has for her daughter is very palpable.

James Frain as Lord Warwick....James Frain, enough said. A great period actor; he never disappoints.  His portrayal of Warwick is thoughtful and insightful.

If you are looking for a juicy story filled with murder, scandal, backstabbing, and scheming....there is nothing like a story that really happened.  I recommend you give this show a try. ;-)",1377302400,248,2232,4.882666666666666
5647858,2,B00BMRTPEM,"The White Queen is a ten-part mini-series based on three novels from Philippa Gregory's Cousins' War series: The White Queen, The Red Queen and The Kingmaker's Daughter. Unusually for this sort of series, the focus is less on the men and battles and more on the viewpoints and experiences of three women who played important roles in the period. These are Elizabeth Woodville, the minor noble who becomes Queen Consort (unusual in a time when the king usually marries European royalty or nobility); the pious Margaret Beaufort, the mother of Henry Tudor (the future Henry VII); and Anne Neville, the younger daughter of Richard Neville and the future wife of the notorious Richard III. Other women also play important secondary roles, such as Margaret of York (Henry VII's bride-to-be), Isabel Neville (Anne's older sister) and Jacquetta, Lady Rivers (Elizabeth Woodville's mother). This presents an interesting female perspective on a period of history traditionally dominated by accounts of battles and manly men strapping on armour.

Or rather, it would if the series worked. The White Queen may be the very definition of 'inconsistent'. The series lurches from mediocrity to being outright terrible to having a couple of pretty decent episodes and then back again. It's certainly no Game of Thrones (the huge success of which is almost certainly responsible for this series being made; the Wars of the Roses were a major influence on George R.R. Martin's books) but it often struggles to even be The Tudors.

On the plus side, the casting for the most part is good. The actresses playing the central three roles are all pretty good, though Amanda Hale's Margaret Beaufort has to cope with some pretty awful writing at times (her reaction to any crisis being to proclaim, ""This is God's will!""), with Faye Marsay (Anne Neville) being one of the few actors to convincingly age in her performance as well as appearance over the course of the series. James Frain's scheming Earl of Warwick is excellent, with his political machinations occasionally being interrupted by Gordon Ramsay-style explosive losses of temper at his allies' incompetence or bad judgement. Rupert Graves schemes admirably as William, Lord Stanley in the latter half of the series (and should be signed up for Game of Thrones as soon as an appropriate role becomes available). Aneurin Barnard makes for a convincing Richard III, who is here played as a more tragic figure doomed by circumstance rather than a cartoon villain (despite developing a passing resemblance to Edward Scissorhands by the series finale). David Oakes (George, Duke of Clarence) may be getting typecast as 'gittish medieval noble bloke', having played this role before on Pillars of the Earth and The Borgias, but he plays it very well. The weakest link here is Max Irons, whose oafish and dull Edward IV is lacking the charisma of the real historical figure.

The series is at its best when centred on a short time-period. The sixth through eighth episodes (covering the relatively peaceful period between the Battle of Tewkesbury and Edward IV's death) are the strongest, as they focus on political machinations, family relationships and the characters themselves. The ninth episode, which jumps forward to the rise of Richard III and the situation with the Princes in the Tower, is also decent. However, the first half of the series is deeply flawed. Dialogue is almost exclusively based on exposition, with people reeling off information as if from a Wikipedia entry in a vain effort to keep the viewer up to speed on what the heck is going on. Weeks and sometimes months pass between scenes with absolutely no indication of the passage of time and the compression of seven years of fairly intricate history into just five episodes (the remaining five cover fourteen years) turns out to be a really bad idea. People swap sides, often for no apparent reason, and there is a lack of depth to events. It feels like the drama bits of a good docu-drama, only without the context for what is happening (a familiarity with the Wars of the Roses - or just keeping the Wikipedia page open as you watch - is useful). These early episodes are kept alive only by the heroic efforts of James Frain and, to a lesser extent, our three leads.

That said, the series finale is pretty diabolical. The lead-up to the Battle of Bosworth and the battle itself are compressed into one hour, leaving no time for the aftermath, some of which is deliciously ironic (particularly the taught relationships between Margaret Beaufort, Elizabeth Woodville and Maragret of York). The series has no real ending, just fading out after the battle without much reflection on what's happened. This feels anti-climactic and fails to put the series in its proper historical context for those who are not already knowledgeable about the time period. My co-watchers had no idea that Elizabeth Woodville and Margaret Beaufort were the grandmothers of Henry VIII, for example, and not ending with an epilogue where Margaret sees her grandson being crowned (she died only after Henry VIII came to power) seems like a missed opportunity.

In terms of historical accuracy, the series is surprisingly good in its first few episodes. It doesn't dial back the complexity of affairs too much, although a few minor characters like the Earl of Warwick's brother, are missing. As the series goes on, however, it deviates more and more from actual history. A few times it shows some good judgement - such as managing to maintain the ambiguity of the fate of the Princes in the Tower without sacrificing the drama - but more often than not it makes baffling choices. The showdown between Elizabeth Woodville's brother Antony, guarding her son and heir Edward V, and the soon-to-be Richard III is ripe stuff for television drama but the TV show simply removes it.

However, the series ultimately has two major problems which moves it from 'watchable tosh' to 'barely watchable hokum' category. The first is that Jacquetta and her daughter Elizabeth are witches. I don't meant they are accused of being witches (as both were in real life), but they actually are witches. They use magic on multiple occasions to summon storms to smash enemy fleets or delay them from sailing and put curses on people that ultimately kill them or leave their children dead. For a series based on real historical events, this injection of pure fantasy is jaw-droppingly stupid. They don't even sell it particularly well, with the participants discussing their magic-using ways in letters and everyone around them being relaxed about it.

Secondly, the show looks cheap. It may have been made for $25 million (that's about $39 million, or a bit more than half the budget of a season of Game of Thrones), but that's simply far too little to tell a story of this magnitude. The costumes are good (blatantly visible zips aside) but the bulk of the action takes place on a relatively small number of sets or on locations re-used a few too many times for supposedly different locations. The budget problem is most notable when it comes to the battles. The Wars of the Roses turned on a series of major battles at Towton, Barnet, Tewkesbury and Bosworth Field. Towton predates the start of the series, but the other three battles are fought during it and all of them are fake, unconvincing and so poorly-staged they might as well have not bothered. In particular, the decision to film both the Battle of Barnet and the Battle of Bosworth Field (and that's 'Field', remember) in the same forest (!) is truly moronic. Armies are shown marching in single file and then rushing towards one another with zero semblance of formation, tactics or strategy. The production team only seem to have about 15 extras available and no CGI budget (a couple of shots of ships aside, there doesn't seem to be any CGI at all in the series, which is baffling as it means they can't stage any big events convincingly), so the battles then unfold in extreme close-up with no continuity from shot to shot, making it almost impossible to follow what's going on. So as to avoid showing the fact they have no extras, the director also sticks the camera on the ground aiming up at people, which gets distracting quite quickly.

Ultimately, you cannot tell the story of 20 years of the Wars of the Roses (and not even the full conflict) in just ten episodes. The pacing is shot to hell in the first half of the series, meaning most people won't stick around for the decent-ish episodes in the latter half. The budget is woefully inadequate for the scale and scope of the series, and the attempt to stretch it to cover everything leaves it looking cheap. The writing is often excruciating (though this also improves in the latter half). All of this undermines the work of some pretty good actors heroically tackling the iffy material.

The White Queen (**) has moments when it almost works, but these moments can't quite make up for the crushing mediocrity and outright incompetence of the rest of the series.",1376870400,45,9046,4.90333115610712
5647859,5,B00BMRTPEM,"Before I saw this series, I did not know what The White Queen was about. I saw a trailer for it on TV and found that it was to be a TV series based on Philippa Gregory's novel of the same name. I knew of her work from the movie version of her novel The Other Boleyn Girl (a very inaccurate take on Tudor history), but have not as of yet read any of her novels based roughly upon between 15-1600's on the Tudor's and so fourth. I love Tudor history and more than that I love anything on the British Monarchy. I know a lot on Henry VIII and his wives as well as Queen Elizabeth I, but I did not have any knowledge onto the Plantagenet's or anything about the War of the Roses. So I jumped on this series and immediately began to watch it hoping it to be better than the Showtime series The Tudors.

I have to say at first I wasn't sure I thought though while the story seemed to be intriguing, I wasn't falling for the main characters like King Edward and his wife Elizabeth in the first episode, but by the second and third episode of the series I was completely hooked. I know there are a lot of reviews from critics saying the series didn't hold up to the standards they expected, but I think a lot of that was based on the first episode alone in the series and not the story all together as a whole.

I never realized how fascinating the War of the Roses was or what it was about. I think what makes this story so much more compelling to me versus other shows around the time period like The Tudors, is that it is told in the view of the woman who stood behind the throne and who shaped England's history dramatically without the world even realizing their importance to what was happening on the throne and how they could influence it. Unlike in The Tudors where it was more of a mans view on the world. Their are three main woman who shape the story over the period of ten episodes. You have the White Queen Elizabeth who was King Edwards wife, then you have Queen Anne who was Queen to King Richard III and you have Margaret who becomes the King's mother to Henry VII.

These woman are each inspiring in their own ways. Elizabeth Woodhouse is a very strong character in the story. She's not afraid to voice her opinion and stand for what she says. She was also one of the first monarch's to have her children stay with her while they were growing up, where in all other noble families you would send them away for months or years at a time to be tutored and not brought back to live with their families till after their education was completed on how they were to behave as a future king or queen. While Anne in the beginning is very passive wanting to please her family and sister, she is caught in the middle as her father tries to get her older sister married to one of the brother's of Kind Edward and keeps being tossed aside till her father needs her in one of his schemes to take the throne. Through all of this she finds her strength and takes charge of her own destiny. While Margaret is devote to god and seeing her son put on the throne at such huge odds that when you think of it, it's amazing she achieved so much with so much in front of her, when the cards seemed stacked against her.

What makes this series work so well are the different view points that are captured through the eyes of these woman. You can't help but feel for each one of them as they are pushed from one place to another, but each time this happens they rise again. What Philippa Gregory has done so well is she has shown 3 different view points of the same conflict and has shown us as the viewers different perspectives to the story line based on view you are looking at.

This series is a fast pace series as far as time lapses go. Episode 1 starts off with the meeting and marrying of King Edward to Elizabeth Woodhouse. By episode two they are married and have children and by the end you are at the beginning of the Tudor era. Even though there are gaps by years in the show it flows so well together and the drama keeps you glued to the screen. You can't help but feel for these ladies in the show.

As far as how accurate this series it to her books I don't know, how accurate it is to history I do not know either. What makes a great historical drama period piece is when a author knows how to weave the fiction on around the historical events that truly took place. I feel that as far as I can see Gregory has done just that, but just don't quote me completely on it! The magic of an author should be to captivate the audience and have have them wondering which parts are the fictitious and which are reality and when it comes to Plantagenet's history it can be hard to say what was fact and what was Tudor propaganda. Leading the reader or watcher to make up their own mind. Which is exactly what Philippa Gregory does.",1376870400,92,4822,4.185145317545748

5647862,4,B00BMRTPEM,"One night early there was a preview showing of this new series from the Brits. It looks promising if a bit unorthodox in its approach to history and slips in the settings and costumes. The series is based on Philippa Gregory's novel, `The Cousins' War' and roughly the story line promises to follow these lines:  Set against the backdrop of the Wars of the Roses, the series is the story of the women caught up in the long-drawn-out conflict for the throne of England. It starts in 1464--the nation has been at war for nine years fighting over who is the rightful King of England, as two sides of the same family, the House of York and the House of Lancaster, are in violent conflict over the throne. The story focuses on three women in their quest for power, as they manipulate behind the scenes of history--Elizabeth Woodville, Margaret Beaufort and Anne Neville.

In the first episode we don't see much more than King Edward's bedding and wedding of Elizabeth, a lot of bickering, some fighting, and some castle intrigue. Rebecca Ferguson plays Queen Elizabeth, Amanda Hale plays Lady Margaret Beaufort, Faye Marsay is Anne Neville, and the remarkable actors are Janet McTeer as Jacquetta Woodville (Elizabeth's magical mum) and Max Irons (handsome son of Jeremy Irons) as King Edward. James Frain is an unusually grumpy and sour Lord Warwick and Caroline Goodall is splendid as the evil Duchess Cicely. It is difficult to tell from an isolated episode, but the series has enough interest in the poorly understood realm of the War of the Roses for American audience that it will probably have staying power. Stay tuned...Grady Harp, August 13",1376092800,38,1645,4.850533807829182
5647863,4,B00BMRTPEM,"there is a way to watch bbc as it plays in England, and so i have seen parts 1-8.  two more to go.  i have not been this pleased by a docu drama in a long time, and this one is right up there with the tudors.  the writer is a history teacher at one of the prestigious colleges in uk, and she writes with passion and accuracy.  its about the cousins war, or war of the roses.  The writer concentrates not on the men involved but the 3 women behind the scene.  The costumes are documented, and the buildings are historical.  the women are powerful, clever, driven, and with elizabeth, in love. its about protecting their right to the throne, and they do it vengeance and devotion to their cause and families.  it is rich in colour, and i was wishing there was 15 parts, not 10!  if you liked the tudors, you will love this, minus some of the fun but sometimes brutal sex scenes. there were a couple but tastefully done, the concentration being on family pride.

5647864,1,B00BMRTPEM,"OMG This is supposed to pass as history....
Nothing in this series rings true, Every thing seems to be 21st century pasted on to 14th century backgrounds.
Not only  the zippers which others have commented on, but some of the dresses and costumes that they have their characters don, are Edwardian and not 14th century. The speech and  the mannerisms of the characters are distinctly modern
Can one  just imagine a 15th century King addressed thus by a nobleman:"" King Henry, Sit down there"" I mean really, who wrote these dialogues and then there were the princesses screaming ""Daddy"" when Edward IV returns. Admittedly none of us were witnesses, but I do think that is distinctly a modern form of address for a father.  I realize that Edward and Warwick were cousins/comrades with a long history behind them but once Edward became an anointed king the equation would have changed. I cannot believe that the King would have called  Neville ""Warwick"" but Richard Neville calls Edward by his first name!!!! The list goes on and on,
 Margaret of Anjou speaks English with a perfect British accent.... but ironically the character reminds us, "" I am French""

Finally will someone tell Amanda Hale that repeated grimaces can only go so far to be construed as genuine acting ability. Lady Margaret Beaufort's character was annoying  to the point of making my skin crawl.
Gratuitous nudity has already been addressed by others and so I will leave it alone

The White Queen (2013) starts off strong, the first couple of episodes are good, but then the queen becomes a secondary character. A handful of uninteresting female characters become the main players and then many scenes are about women crying or screaming women giving birth. Women and babies. If thats what you want to watch this series is for you. The series suffers from poor lighting and camera use. Did they hire a bunch of students to make this?

This show had a good beginning, but got lost in the middle, and if there was a coherent ending I missed it.

I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989, Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

Here are a few series I really enjoyed watching more than once: Band of Brothers (2001), Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Black Sails (2014-2017), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lonesome Dove (1989), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

5647892,5,B00BMRTPEM,"The first thing we must say, from my American frame of reference, is that this has nothing to do with race. This epics the Wars of the Roses -- one rose white, one red. Specifically, this series epics the reign of King Edward IV and his consort Queen Elizabeth. They are Yorks, the white rose. And, oh my goodness, what brilliant cast, each artistically depicted from the physical appearances to the garments they wore to the sets to the props and even the lighting. I literally cannot think of a mediocre actor or scene in the series.  The tale itself is so filled with intrigue that one need not fabricate, yet it takes a poetic license with detail. I was happy to see that Richard was not portrayed from a Shakespearian point of view -- which is usually the case. Again, from my American point of view, I could have found it every bit as delicious without all of the lurid sex scenes. Can nothing be left to the imagination? Ugh. Fortunately, I could fast forward through more of that, and still find it utterly delicious. This is the first series I've ever binged-watched in my life, but I just couldn't tear myself away...  I will ALWAYS wish that Henry Tutor didn't prevail, even though he did eventually give us Elizabeth I, but Henry Tutor did prevail. If only the little boys in the tower had been better protected.

most of the the acting is SUPERB (i'd say from king edward and queen elizabeth mostly). **spoiler alerts below..**

too bad king edward died. would have liked to see less screwing around and more guidance of his kids...like how to fight maybe? lol ..interesting plots and revenges..sad the ending of the series didn't show who killed the first son and where the story re-begins..guess that's why they made ""the white princess""...we shall see where it goes..too bad it's with NONE of the original cast too..*sigh*",1515024000,,572,4.958333333333333

5647900,5,B00BMRTPEM,"I really loved this series. From the script, to the excellent performances, to the lavish sets, it's full of period detail and technical merit. As an amateur medievalist, I was very familiar with the story, and the series sticks very close to fact as we know it, while giving a nod to the book on which this is based. Elizabeth was a fascinating, smart, engaging woman in real life (and reportedly quite a beauty) who well understood what she had to do in order for she and her family to survive in a tough society and era.  The ad sells this as a story about ""scheming"" women - I find that really cheap and insulting, and frankly that isn't what the story is about. These women had enormous heart, did have morals, and also had the brains to play the games they were forced to play from birth.  That isn't ""scheming and manipulation"", it's survival.  I want to mention especially the beautiful performance of Rebecca Ferguson in the lead role - this series garnered her some well-deserved and overdue professional attention and led to other roles.  The viewer will recognize the actress playing Warwick's older daughter as the woman playing a lead role in Poldark. And Max Irons is really fine - and great to look at - as the tempestuous, strong-willed warrior king Edward IV - the real man was as tall, as handsome, as stubborn, as impetuous, and  Max nails it. Edward is remembered as one of England's most successful kings.  Anyone who loves history, wants to understand the Wars of the Roses, and great historical drama, will like this one.",1513123200,,1545,4.641025641025641

5647914,4,B00BMRTPEM,"This is without a doubt a good, entertaining show that kept its entertaining qualities throughout the story. You can always know a good show by how many episodes actually hold your attention. This show definitely did that! The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was because after awhile I grew a bit weary of all of the underhanded dealings and the selfish ambitions of every character in the show. If people being back-stabby is not your thing, I would soooo stay away from this show. If you like decent writing, great actors, historical pieces, and a bit of treachery than I highly recommend this show.",1508976000,,610,4.657407407407407

I watched the first season. Later while I was working on my family tree I found out that these people are my ancestors.
Needless to say I had to watch it again.

5647917,3,B00BMRTPEM,"With a sustained effort over a two year period, I made it through this series. It is soap opera history, complete with bits of ridiculous magic, tragic and opportunistic loves, and constant driving greed and lust as motivation. I can't say there was a plot or any story line, just a bunch of pretty scenes with a lot of undeveloped characters strung together in a vague historical chronology. The female characters are more interesting, with the religious zealot who interprets every advantage as god's will, and, toward, the end, the smug snooty teenager who figures she's going to be queen whoever wins. You won't feel anything for any of the characters, and you won't learn anything about history or human motivations, other than everybody wants to be king or get with the king.",1507420800,2,781,4.879699248120301
5647918,1,B00BMRTPEM,"1 star because the series is completely without the need for. frequent, prolonged, nude  sex scenes.  Frequent witchcraft scenes that may not hold true to historical events. Using FIVE WATT BULBS IN EVERY SINGLE SCENE INDOORS  so that people or rooms CAN'T be seen.  WHY a movie maker doesn't want you to see throughout an entire movie is beyond acceptable and is annoying and irredeemable.  ALL the talking and scheming cannot be true, only guessed at so I don't find this ""historical"".  As per a series goes, there was far too much talking in order to stretch the series into boredom in far too many scenes. Lady Margaret, and her, far too many scenes that consisted of twisted, rubbery, contorted facial expressions got on my nerves.  She wins the brass ring for letting the world see on the outside what her inner thoughts were of hate, malice, deceit, self-righteousness, greed, pretension, self-gain, devious, fraudulent,..I'll just say ""evil"".  The entire series is, in essence, how man goes through life without God, has made themselves their own gods, their blindness and deafness toward the true purpose of why God created them, lives spent in greed, power, deceit, fear, satanism, and sex, self adornment and self adulation.  The world calls it ""the elite"" or ""the Royals"", or King's and Queens, or godless human race.  God calls them ""the Spiritually dead"".",1506816000,2,1369,4.991189427312776

The acting is excellent, the history is pretty much correct, the period costumes and set decoration ring true etc. What really prevents me from giving a five star review is the absurd inclusion of witchcraft used by the Woodville women.

The characters are not interesting, they lack chemistry, the sex which is clearly supposed to be risque seems contrived and awkward (cue music... wait, he's sweating already?  But why only on one arm? and already?).  The costumes are not accurate to the time period, there's no clear explanation or backstory or motivation provided for why a widow with two children would even be so drawn to this king (especially given that he's kind of a tool) or why he would be so drawn to her.  I guess we're supposed to believe it's because she's incredibly beautiful, but there's nothing to explain why the man who could have anyone wants the widow with no title and two young sons...

This is another concoction based off of Phillipa Gregory - she does historical fantasy fiction; so these are real time periods and people (some a amalgamation of the historic persons) . It is pretty decent as far as that goes (it was basically gossip that Richard lll was in love with his niece Elizabeth - they weren't going to marry - I don't know of any Papal dispensation that would ok that! That didn't deter a lot of actual historic marriages/relations in the past---- uhhh..) I digress Max Irons (son of Jeremy Irons) is Edward VI and Rebecca Ferguson is Elizabeth Woodville. James Frain - a mainstay in these types of series (he plays such a good baddie!) is Earl of Warwick - The Kingmaker, Janet McTeer is Jacquetta Woodville - Elizabeth's mother. They rely heavily on the hearsay that she was a descendant of Melusina a river witch/goddess. STILL it is good - I wouldn't let the young ones watch - I mean it isn't a PBS/BBC documentary with historic facts and historians and professors talking about it - it is actors and nudity and violence - they do not show the actual beheadings but do show plenty and I do mean plenty of the birthday suits. It really isn't that bad - I mean the entire series is entertaining and the cast is lovely.

5647973,5,B00BMRTPEM,"I just binge watched season 1.  It is riveting.  The costumes are splendid.  The acting superb.  It is a must for anglophiles and anyone who loves historical fiction.  Though I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the history, you definitely get the jest of the time period and brutality of political maneuvering of the times.  The series certainly portrays the fragile nature of the life of anyone who sat on the throne or who was in line to ascend to the throne of any country. There seemed to be little loyalty within families when it came to who would or would not ascend to the throne.

I've read some reviews which describe it as porn, so I would like to address that allegation.  It is not porn and anyone who calls it that has not seen porn.  There is implied sex but in my opinion, it is done tastefully.  There is some nudity, no genitals.  Some people may have found distasteful the fact that there were teenage girls being forced (by their parents) to marry for political posturing.  In the historical context, I did not consider it to be rape when a girl was forced to wed and then have sex.  She knew she was expected to produce a male heir and would have to have sex to do so.  Women were subjugated and their lives dependent on the wishes of their father or husband. Arranged marriages, especially among the nobility, was common.  Marriage was a contract between families to gain status, money or position; and male heirs were the goal of those unions.  Social norms regarding marriage and children were much different in those times than they are now and you must keep that in mind and not judge based on what would be accepted today.  So if any of that bothers you, this might not be the series for you.",1495152000,2,1717,4.451923076923077

The cast is brilliant and incredibly talented, especially Aneurin Barnard playing Richard. If you're into untrained Hollywood actors, then watch something else. I've heard that the show isn't completely historically accurate, but, first of all, it's an adaptation, so you should expect inaccuracies (like in many other period dramas). Second, the episodes are so well written that you might as well forget about how things went in reality. I couldn't stop myself from clicking ""next""!",1494547200,3,607,5.268041237113402

5647981,2,B00BMRTPEM,"Much of the acting leaves a great deal to be desired.  Several of the female roles are played in a way that makes the women they portray look more like clumsy peasants forced to put on costumes and act as highborn nobles, most notably Margaret Beaufort and the two daughters of the Earl of Warwick, whereas the older women grossly overact.  While in the broad strokes of history, the series is fairly accurate, it is overly romanticized, the witchcraft element is screwball, the accuracy of the costumes atrocious (some of the fabrics are visibly synthetic, some of the jewelry looks play jewelry from Walmart, few of the women wear headdresses and when they do, they are comically and cheaply rendered), and the palace flooring and carpets are so modern, cheap, shiny, and new, they look as thought they are fresh out of Home Depot.  The period and the characters are interesting and deserve more intelligent treatment.",1494288000,,920,4.884615384615385
5647982,3,B00BMRTPEM,"I just did a marathon of this first season of the story, which I liked. It seemed to get a bit thread bare on the last few episodes, but I was already sold on it. The way it leaves off, I expected the next season to pick up where it left off. That did not happen however. I didn't see any of the same actors in the white princess series and where the last few episodes of this story begin to go off the historical path a bit more than I liked, they pale in comparison to the absolute ludicrous story line you will be able to pick up next season, with a cheap cheap cheap costume, set, story and cast. This thing started off so beautifully done, I didn't expect that to fade so quickly.

If whoever is in charge of series for Star is cutting budgets to show more profit, they are stupid. There will be no more of this crap for me. I've wasted too much time on a tv show with no clear plot. That is despite the fact that they had the books and history to go by and still mucked it up.

The characters casual disregard for integrity on almost any level illustrates the basest human condition when baited with wealth and power.

5647997,5,B00BMRTPEM,"Five RUTHLESS Stars. This is Season 1 of ""The White Queen"", based on the ""Cousin's War"" series of novels by talented author Phillipa Gregory: ""The White Queen"", ""The Red Queen"", and ""The Kingmaker's Daughter"". With much assumed dramatic license, in this historical recreation of events involving the ""War of the Roses"", it's king versus would-be king, relatives versus relatives, house versus house versus house, commoners versus noble lineage, army versus army, spy versus spy, some seeming mysticism, and 3 very determined, ruthless females pulling the strings in the foreground and background to get or keep one of the biggest royal prizes of them all: the English throne. It's fascinating to watch the aging of the characters as the plot develops, sometimes involving multiple actors, as they age.

""The White Queen"" begins in 1464, during the ""War of the Roses"", the reign of King Edward IV, and the entanglements of the York and Lancaster families. The storyline builds steadily towards the climatic battle events and the aftermath of Episode 10, as things come to a head and all of the stops are pulled out. Some historical mysteries that remain to this day are hinted at during the show. Starring an outstanding group of actors, including Rebecca Ferguson, Max Irons, Janet McTeer, Aneurin Barnard, Amanda Hale, Rupert Graves, Faye Marsay, Ben Lamb, Freya Mavor, Tom McKay, James Frain, Shaun Dooley, Nicholas Croucher, Sonny Ashbourne Serkis, Andrew Gower, and more. Highly Recommended. Five RIVETING Stars.  (Starz Originals. BBC. A Company Pictures Production, Playground Entertainment. Rated TV-MA. Color. HD. CC. X-Ray. Time-10 episodes of about 1 hour each.)",1491264000,4,1672,5.329545454545454

Being an (armchair) genealogist, and learning that my ancestry include descendants of the Plantagenets and both Yorkist & Lancastrian Nobles. This movie just brings history more to life in real time for me.
I highly recommend doing some reading on wikipedia and familiarize yourself with the political players who were involved with King Henry VII at English Court.  It will help clairfy who's who in King Henry VII's Court.
Now, I look forward to ""The White Princess"" with great anticipation.",1491091200,,747,4.702290076335878

5648025,4,B00BMRTPEM,"I have always found the War of the Roses saga massively confusing.  Watching this series made it a lot clearer to me.  I wish that the conspiracy theory of Elizabeth coughing up a kid who looks like a Prince to go to the Tower to join his brother hadnt been done.  The theory is just so hard to believe that, in a way, it cheapened the story and really if you bring up that theory, where are you going to go with it besides nowhere?  And not only could the writer/s go nowhere with it, they hit a dead end made of brick and mortar and were probably hoping the viewer wouldnt notice.  If it weren't for this, I would have given 5 stars.

On the other side of the coin is the Margaret Tudor (Stanley).  What a remarkable woman and such faith to see her son through.  I wish I could have better understood why nobody bothered to kill off Henry.  They had no problem killing off other people and, as it was stated when considering the murder of the Princes, boys grow into men.  This theory never spread to Henry fortunately but again, it was never clear why it did not.

Lastly, I patiently waited a few years for this series to get on Prime.  It was worth the wait and although I know it was done as advertisement for The White Princess that begins filming this year, Im not sure I will wait five years for the Princess to come on Prime and I sure as hell won't pay for it.",1486598400,,1371,4.151515151515151

While it's not totally historically accurate on some things, it is at the core and I think the way the storyline is written fills in the gaps and of course, adds romanticism to an otherwise harsh and unbearable life they must have lived.

5648120,5,B00BMRTPEM,"This is a delicious series based on Philippa Gregory's historical novels about the Wars of the Roses  in 15th Century England. The name of the series derives from the House of York's emblem of the white rose. The Yorks warred for decades with the House of Lancaster, represented by the emblem of the Red rose. The characters in this very real slice of history are riveting, notwithstanding the perspective of over 500 years. I was impressed by the acting chops of all of the actors who portrayed characters great and small in this series.
The era in which this drama is set is one of the most confusing historically of any in English history. It would be helpful for any viewer to read, at a minimum, Philippa Gregory's books before watching the series, lest the intricacies of the conflict between the Yorks and the Lancasters cause the viewer to lose track of the plot. It is well worth the effort, however. The era of the Wars of the Roses was the mother of all soap operas.
One final note: it is not suitable for children.",1485475200,,1026,4.545945945945946

5648153,4,B00BMRTPEM,"If you really want to hear the story of the Game of Thrones there is no better dynasty to study than the Plantagenets.  They have it all, villians, heroes, great warriors, and cowards.  Most of history portrays Elizabeth as a vixen who plotted to capture a kings heart.  Edward the IV is presented as a great king who died too soon whose only failing was a failure to control his appetite.  A totally Plantagenet failing.  The name King Richard has only appeared three times in English history.  The first Richard was the closest thing to a God of War as Europe ever came.  He was better as Richard the Lion Hearted.  The second Richard was partly to blame for the beginning of the War of the Roses.  His Uncle, John of Gaunt Duke of Lancaster had stayed loyal to his nephew after the death of the Black Prince.  When the Duke died Richard had banished his son, Henry of Bolingbroke, and attempted to seize all the Lancaster land.  Henry became the IV, his son the glorious Henry the V, and his son was the wobbly Henry the VI who fell to Edward the IV.  Oh, and Henry's claim to the throne?  Came from his Mother Margaret of Beaufort the great-granddaughter of John of Gaunt and his third wife Katherine Swynford with whom he had an affair for over 20 years.  The Tudor's can thank John of Gaunt for managing to twist both the arm of King Richard the II and the Pope to sign off on legitimizing his children by Katherine Swynford upon their marriage and failing to add the clause that would have blocked them from claiming the throne.
The White Queen is just an approach to the end of the story from a different point of view than what is usually told.  Usually, Richard is presented as an evil man who killed to innocent boys.  But of all the actors in this drama Richard the III had the least reason to kill the boys and Henry the most.  We will never know.",1484784000,26,1860,4.3604651162790695
5648154,4,B00BMRTPEM,"If High School History class was presented like this, kids would eat it up.  I'm sure there is a little license inserted but its pretty much factual.  Good production.

5648194,5,B00BMRTPEM,"I love historical movies.  This one really gave an insight into Richard III as well as other characters surrounding Edward IV.  I have a milder view of Richard.  I also like the character development of Margaret, mother of Henry Tudor.  Interesting, too, the machinations surrounding succession to the throne.  History buffs will love it.  Some factual deviation, but overall informative and entertaining.",1484524800,,405,5.451612903225806

5648198,5,B00BMRTPEM,Exciting series! It showed us that women who became married by arrangements of their families to raise the families closer to the reign of England could entice spouses into doing things that favored their famillies. These arranged marriages affected the future of full families. The white queen herself became queen because of Edward's attraction to her and her resistance to him until they were married.,1484438400,,404,5.230769230769231

5648209,5,B00BMRTPEM,"Ok, like the Tudors, this is a story within a political context.  Part fact, part fiction, pure entertainment.  Romanticized?  Yes, but it doesn't drip with sappy women whose only desire is to promote the men in their lives.  They are presented as complex, multifaceted people with varying abilities and interests; some are selfless, others as are as selfish as any male political animal.  It is for this reason that I can groan through the inaccurate, even fanciful historical contrivances and just enjoy the story as a telling from the feminine perspective.",1484179200,,559,5.0989010989010985

5648280,3,B00BMRTPEM,"Historical fiction - an interesting account of the War of the Roses between the Yorks and Lancasters.  Elizabeth marries Edward to become queen and has lots of little children, but others covet the crown; there is a historical basis but the rest is a fairly interesting drama including court intrigue and bloody beheadings, among other things!  I felt the acting was good and although the main characters were OK sometimes I would have to think ""now whose side is this one one, why are they together?"" but I guess that's the nature of such a complicated conflict.

5648320,5,B00BMRTPEM,"Fantasy drama mixed with history, with a splash of action. The camera work is typically very good in this! However, some of the historical facts are embellished for dramatic effect.",1483315200,,181,5.066666666666666
5648321,2,B00BMRTPEM,"This is not a bad film but for some reason, the makers of this film, i.e. the BBC believe the watchers want to watch one sex scene followed by another. The film limps from one scene of gratuitous sex to another. It is all absolutely unnecessary to the story line and the quality of the acting and filming. One has to ask oneself who would want to be an actor or actress these days. There seems to be a requirement to be able to perform pornographically. Consequently, I have to impress parents of young children and teens to not allow their children to watch this series. It is hardly what one would call accurate historically so they will not be missing anything.",1483315200,4,664,4.450819672131147
5648322,5,B00BMRTPEM,"I am not one to listen to the critics, I like to judge for myself and I love this movie. Others have pointed out chronology and anachronisms, but the movie is okay with me. I wish there was a little more character development from all 3 of the books, but other than that the acting was good  and enjoyable to me.",1483315200,,312,4.114754098360656

5648331,4,B00BMRTPEM,"The story line moves quickly. You donto have long before you are introduced to new characters. You learn some brief information about the characters-just enough to get the story started. Other series that I enjoy more spend an episode letting you get to know a set of characters before they introduce new ones. I rather get a good background story initially so I can understand the character as their life unfolds in the storyline. I'm not a fan of how abruptly the White Queen was introduced.  However, the series is decent. It has its fair share of love, lust, and foul play.",1483315200,,577,4.6568627450980395

5648335,5,B00BMRTPEM,Fans of historical fiction will not want to miss this series.  Based on the novel The White Queen by Philippa Gregory this screen adaptation consists of 10 episodes. Each episode ends with a dramatic cliff hanger that beckons the viewer to continue on. Rebecca Ferguson beautiful and alluring as Queen Elizabeth is phenomenal. Her  character is played with intense emotion with a strong memorable performance. The White Queen casting is as close to perfect as you can get. Highly recommended.,1483315200,,492,5.1375

No matter which side of the war of the roses you are rooting for, the characters on the other side are sympathetic too. Plus, it is interesting how history and the fiction dovetail; or how common perception, say about Richard, is tested.",1482969600,,380,4.291666666666667

5648381,4,B00BMRTPEM,"Very beautiful and true to history.  Followed the book quite well.  I had a bit of trouble with the love scenes.  Why is it necessary to see so many bare breast?.  It adds nothing to the story and I think it is only there for shock value.  Also, why do we have to see naked bodies intertwined, when the actors are not married to each other.  I'm no prude, but that was as close to being pornographic as I can imagine.  May be why there is only one season.  Actors were dynamic in their roles.  Least favorite was Queen Anne, who was rigid and child like.  Elizabeth stole the movie.  Have watched it through twice, fast forwarding the above mentioned scenes.  May even watch it again.",1482883200,,684,4.341269841269841

5648408,1,B00BMRTPEM,Started watching then stopped due to its repetitive gratuitous sexual scenes which were unnecessary to the telling of the tale.

Really....All of them are TOP NOTCH.  I have no idea why this did not take off or why an immediate sequel was not in the works straight away (apparently one is now but with different actors since it's 3 years later). The problem may be that VERY few have Starz network,  but if you're a prime member or even on Amazon, order this up. Seriously DO YOURSELF a favor and watch this series. It will transport you away from this 2016 world and I think we need that more than ever now.  Bedroom scenes not too shabby either...

5648418,5,B00BMRTPEM,This loosely historical series follows the intrigues of royalty in mid to late 1400's England.  It is quite interesting and entertaining.  It is not for the children in the household as graphic scenes of violence and explicit sex abound and add little to what is an interesting historical period piece.,1482364800,,302,5.02

I like it. Cannot watch it all at once, but look forward to upcoming episodes already on Amazon, as well as the second season.  It is too bad no one has ever discovered beyond a doubt what happened to the two little princes in the tower.

5648475,4,B00BMRTPEM,"Very entertaining and stuffed full of intrigue and manipulation. So much so that it becomes almost tedious at times to sort it all out. Which mother is plotting to have which son ascend the throne? But, finally a show where most of the nasty bad guys are women.

However, if you're looking for a reasonably sound historical drama, this is an excellent choice. My only complaint is where the series ends - I feel like there are a lot of unanswered questions (of course, if you know history you know the answers, but that's not my point).",1481500800,,445,4.792207792207792

Occasionally, the plot shifts, leaving gaps that make it difficult to follow the story; but, overall I thoroughly enjoy this show.

I do think some of the nudity is gratuitous and sometimes irrelevant to the plot.)",1480896000,,451,4.87012987012987

5648545,4,B00BMRTPEM,"12/4/2016 - Like most modern historical novelists, Gregory takes a lot of liberty with the real history.  Elizabeth never slept with her Uncle Richard.  Her marriage to Henry Tudor was a gloriously happy one and their many children were intelligent, charming, gifted and religious devout.  There were other instances where the historical facts were distorted, but this was a very entertaining series.  All the nuances, political, religious, social, gender, were touched upon in this series.  Excellent scripts and very good acting for the most part.",1480809600,,549,5.411764705882353

5648578,5,B00BMRTPEM,"This is a startling piece of historical fiction, bringing to attention the lengths to which humankind will go to achieve wealth, fame, power.
Betrayed loyalties, schemes, traps, wars, threats, violence, cruelty, long-standing hatreds, envy, hostility - along with equally passionate experiences at the other end of the emotional scale - are quite normal here as the Aengles and the Saxons war for the monarchy and the perpetuation of their name.

There is lots of talking, mostly to explain the speaker's understanding of his/her motives, the complicated history behind the acquisitions and takings of the throne, and the machinations of the human heart. Bloody business - and very good drama.

I enjoyed every minute.",1479686400,,718,5.345132743362832

As a student of the history of this period I was impressed with the depth of real history used in this drama - even knowing it was fictionalized.

5648610,4,B00BMRTPEM,I had read the books by Gregory and liked them. The season was lovely to watch and they kept the actual violence down to a minimum for me. I can only watch so many beheadings. Gregory does great research and they are based on history so you can't be looking for happy endings for everyone. Well acted.,1479254400,,301,4.298245614035087

5648625,5,B00BMRTPEM,"Suspenseful, exciting, full of intrigue, very interesting.  Be prepared if you are sensitive to nudity, violence and sex. There is a good bit of all that. What makes it palatable is that it's authentic to the culture and mores of that era.",1479168000,,239,4.690476190476191

5648631,3,B00BMRTPEM,"I enjoyed this series, but it is a more cheesy-feeling historical drama, than say Downton Abbey or another BBC production. That being said, I liked it and finished it.

5648659,4,B00BMRTPEM,"Boy, can Rebecca Ferguson take a tight close up, freckles and all. She's incredibly disciplined. Knows her angles and displays strength and elegance in every scene. She's playing against some other incredible actors. Amanda Hale, who plays Lady Margaret Beaufort, is Rebecca's nemesis, one of several in the series. Whereas the production budget for a similar series, Vikings was estimated to be around $40,000,000, the production budget for The White Queen came in at around $27,000,000 USD. As far as spectacle goes, The White Queen can't be compared to Vikings in terms of scope and scale. What makes The White Queen Work, I think, are two key elements. The first is Rebecca Ferguson. The second is the set locations in Ghent and Bruges, medieval appearing cities. There's material in this series that would be a hard ""R"" rating, so be careful.",1478995200,,847,5.01418439716312

5648826,3,B00BMRTPEM,"This series has a lot of nudity which seems unnecessary and  is definitely not suitable for a family show. Also, some of the actors are terrible. Also, for most of the series, even though it represented 15 years, they did not age the king and queen. The show is light entertainment and not equal to the Vikings. The king is so baby-faced, even at the end of the film when he is supposed to have aged 20 years-make-up department? And the filming of orgies in the kings chamber with a number of advisers around and at battle seems unrealistic.",1477785600,4,541,4.4646464646464645

5648891,1,B00BMRTPEM,"At first, I was very excited by this series, especially when the first few scenes didn't have excessive violence. However, this series has far too much nudity. I prefer shows with no nudity at all, but this show had nudity at such unnecessary times, it was riduculous. I kept laughing at the show because it was so absurd, like someone randomly talking about how they bought their shoes at Payless in the middle of an episode. Its so out of place that its comical. We can tell a character is a prostitute without seeing breasts. We can tell people are having sex without seeing breasts. We can tell that a couple is passionately in love without seeing breasts. We can tell someone is having a bath without seeing breasts. It really felt like breasts were one of the main characters of this show! If you would like an interesting period drama without nudity try Poldark. Really great, thrilling period drama! Other great period shows include Downtown Abbey, Dr. Thorne, and Jane Austen movies, though these have far less action than Poldark. This series could have been much better.",1477440000,2,1081,4.75531914893617

5648907,5,B00BMRTPEM,"Great show! I loved it! The series is set against the backdrop of the Wars of the Roses and presents the story of the women involved in the protracted conflict for the throne of England. It starts in 1464; the nation has been at war for nine years fighting over who is the rightful King of England, as two sides of the same family, the House of York and the House of Lancaster, are in violent conflict over the throne. The story focuses on three women in their quest for power, as they manipulate events behind the scenes of history: Elizabeth Woodville, Margaret Beaufort, and Anne Neville. Elizabeth Woodville is the central character in the novel The White Queen, while Margaret Beaufort and Anne Neville are the focus of the novels The Red Queen and The Kingmaker's Daughter, respectively. However, all three characters appear in all three novels that went to make up the television series. Now I am looking forward for the sequel : The White Princess",1477267200,15,955,4.690476190476191

5648963,5,B00BMRTPEM,"I really enjoyed this series because, the acting was really good, and the major events did stick to what we know for sure. Yes, there are some liberties taken (no one ever accused Elizabeth of witchcraft, only her mother; we do not know what happened to the Princes in the Tower) bit it was the license of fiction.

It is nice to have someone lay out how we came to have the British monarchy as we know it..",1476748800,,407,4.217948717948718

5648965,1,B00BMRTPEM,The characters are fully developed-beautifully acted and produced-however;the sexual content is way over the limit for family viewing-I would not recommend this video because of the sexual content.

5648966,2,B00BMRTPEM,"Yes, the scenery was nice, but I look at the story line. My god it was bland. The story line went like this. King has a war. King finds girl. King has another war. Wins the war. King has war with cousin and brother who betrays him. King wins war. King forgives his traitorous cousin and brother. War and more war, and in between there are sex scenes, full nudity and intercourse. Can't we go back to having great movies without it? I couldn't finish the series after four episodes.",1476748800,,481,4.355555555555555

5649113,2,B00BMRTPEM,This season jumps forward in large clumps of time... It was difficult in the beginning to know how many years had gone by. Also to know who the people were... they were not well defined at all. I will skip the next season if there is one....,1475539200,,241,4.148936170212766

5649115,4,B00BMRTPEM,Well acted and well produced novel which is consistent with what is historically known despite failure to follow Shakespeare. Overemphasis on copulation can be forgiven as it was an important occupation of royals to produce heirs.,1475539200,,230,5.416666666666667

5649130,5,B00BMRTPEM,"If you liked the Tudors, you will like this.  It is an historical drama about Edward IV and his bride Elizabeth Woodville and the trials and tribulations of being king & queen of England.  It starts 9 years into the War of the Roses and continues for about 20 years to tell their story.  Edward's brother becomes Richard III (whose bones were found under a parking lot in England a few years ago).  It is a fun story line to watch, while telling the story of an actual English king.  There is lots of drama thrown in, so it can be a little soap opera-like but that is what makes it more fun than reading a history book.  I would recommend this series.",1475539200,,651,4.252032520325203

5649158,5,B00BMRTPEM,"A wonderful series for lovers of Court Intrigue. The lead characters give uniformly excellent performances, especially the White Queen's mother who was award-nominated for her terrific effort.

The one significant drawback is the startlingly rushed climax; probably a result of the show's unexpected cancellation after just one season of ten episodes. At least the show's creators wrap things up for us tidily at the end.",1475366400,,421,5.476923076923077

5649179,5,B00BMRTPEM,"The White Queen is a must see  people who enjoy reading  about English history, specifically about the war of the roses era. It's told from the females' perspective. Janet McTeer does a wonderful job playing queen Elizabeth's mother. Her character is a strong woman with a gentle soul. Amanda Hale's character, Margaret Beaufort, is annoyingly obsessive about her son becoming king. Ms. Hale did an excellent job portraying her.

I enjoyed watching Richard III sitting in the back with is sly and pernicious looks during the turn of events.

5649209,5,B00BMRTPEM,"It is a real history presented in a so exciting drama, once you watch an episode you keep thinking for the next.

5649211,4,B00BMRTPEM,"not historically accurate, but I didn't expect it to be. The acting is good, although most of the nudity was totally unnecessary, the story line is interesting enough to keep you coming back to see what happens next, but also easy to guess what happens next in several episodes.

5649219,5,B00BMRTPEM,Fantastic acting and a very good development from the original novel.  It will be a shame if the entire sequel of books is not made into a series of the same caliber as season 1.  White Queen itself could be made into an excellent second season with the other books following later.,1474848000,,282,4.403846153846154

5649222,3,B00BMRTPEM,"The first episodes held my attention and were suspenseful. As each episode ended, I could hardly wait to watch the next one. However, the last 2 episodes felt rushed to get the story finished. I didn't enjoyed the last episode, as it ended abruptly and left too many questions unanswered. I felt like I wasted my time.",1474848000,,318,4.5964912280701755
5649223,5,B00BMRTPEM,We are really enjoying this series!  I've asked my sisters in the U.K. if they've heard of it and I was so surprised when they hadn't.  I've learned things about English history that I'd forgotten.  Pleased we found it.,1474848000,,219,4.564102564102564

5649229,5,B00BMRTPEM,"Very good series, seemed fairly true to historical stories.  The three primary ladies played their parts very well.  If you like British history, you will most likely enjoy this series, the white queen being the first Queen Elizabeth. I've not read the books, so I cannot compare, though if I decide to read them, I'll will update this post.",1474848000,,341,4.762711864406779
5649230,5,B00BMRTPEM,"This mini series is historically accurate for the timeframe it covers; 1470 or so, England.  It helps bring into perspective the corruption that power brings, and what some people will do for it.  The writers took some creative license, and no one can be sure what really happened outside of what has been preserved through writings and records of that timeframe.  The only character I found completely annoying was the mother of Henry Tudor.  She was playing the part of a pious woman, but constantly made everything about herself.  Perhaps that was in the writings and the actress strove to portray her accurately.  But in any case, it was annoying.  But not so much as to make me give this nothing less than 5 stars.  This series ends with Henry Tudor taking the throne.  The show, ""The Tudors"", which some may be familiar with, happens a couple generations later and picks up there.  History is important, and this series was done well.  There is some brief nudity, breasts, buttocks, perhaps an inappropriate hookup or two, but nothing too racy.",1474848000,,1050,4.810055865921788

Good stuff all around.  But as the series approaches it climax, plot and story devolve into a jumbled mess.  Pacing becomes MUCH too quick. Things start happening so quickly that I found it difficult to keep characters and events straight.  It's as though the original intent was to create a multi-season series that got cancelled about 3/4 of the way into the first season, so the writers tried to cram absolutely everything into the last few episodes.  This really spoiled the overall impression of the series. Worth a look, for sure, but prepare for some frustration as you get deeper in.",1473638400,,746,5.024390243902439

Then their real troubles begin as they attempt to hold it against betrayal, the plots of other kings or queens and the ravages of disease and time.  It makes you wonder why the adjective 'noble' has a positive meaning?  In the context of this story, a noble gesture might involve a poisoned beverage.",1473552000,,468,4.602409638554217

5649501,5,B00BMRTPEM,Loved this show - ended up binge watching it while on vacation - had to steal my kids fire to keep watching when mine went flat!!! I'm not sure how historically accurate it is but it captured the scheming and capriciousness that one imagines court life would have been.

5649538,4,B00BMRTPEM,"Well scripted, well-acted,  Some factual (historical) issues, but when are there not in dramatizations of history. After all, this is a miniseries. Do not use this series as the basis for any masters' thesis in history.  Still, more accurate than the Shakespeare history plays (although you should still read/watch them, because, well, they're Shakespeare).  Basically watching this series is well worth the time.  Stick with it. Find a block of time when you can binge watch -- say over a rainy weekend or if you're in bed with a cold.  Seriously -- watching in one or two sittings is best. Interesting takes on Richard 3, as well as the young princes. It does truly show (as do the novels on which the series is based) how girls were used as pawns in manipulating political power for their fathers, husbands or brothers.  And for those women who were able to exert their own influence, what price they paid.  Have times changed?  Not sure.",1473379200,,941,4.765432098765432

5649566,5,B00BMRTPEM,"Impelling drama that grabs hold in the beginning and doesn't let go. The romance between the key characters through time is both hot and emotionally true. The mother/daughter relationship is a study in what makes that relationship work. To have that mother and to be that mother are equally appealing. The vital Plantagenet history lesson is almost too much to take in. Mainly because the intricacies of these relationships are so humanely crafted and explored in depth that the universality takes you deep into your own relationships, greeds, longings, loves, missteps and wrong choices and you have to pause...and process for yourself. Meantime the story has moved on and it's hard to catch up to left brain facts. No worries. No problem watching this one again. And this time I might even notice whether or not the storyline totally adheres to the riveting book. Bottom line: Especially for anyone who hungers to be swooped into another world and captured there deliciously, this is superb marathoning!",1473206400,,1005,5.096969696969697

5649607,5,B00BMRTPEM,"Love. It.

 Getting completely caught up with Game of Thrones to the current wait for the next season was a little bit like quitting coffee, cigarettes, and red wine cold turkey,  simultaneously. (Which I have done, minus one of the three. I'm not @$?#ing quitting coffee.) Somehow, we discovered White Queen, and at least the tremors have stopped.

There are no flying dragons, it's true, but there are still lots of nude 'people' (R.F.) with perfect... well... everything, and oh yes, the writing is fantastic, the cinematography, astounding.

The quick and dirty: watch it.

Keep in mind that it's (fairly) history-based, so it requires that we think a little more than our iPhone overlords have trained us to, but I mean we've accepted Dinklage's accent for many years now, so come on, we can do this.  And coming away with a rough historical outline of the formation of England's monarchy and  the beginnings of the British Empire,  as opposed to having a great deal of knowledge about a land that doesn't really exist, can't possibly do us as much intellectual damage as we might initially think.",1472947200,,1102,4.881720430107527

However, for some reason, Amazon Prime chose to remove the captions, and I can't make any sense of the last four episodes.  I also went back to some of the episodes that were captioned when I watched the first time.  None of those are captioned either.  The Americans with Disability Act specifies that all entertainment (as well as other parts of life) should be accessible to all people--including those who have hearing loss.

5649766,3,B00BMRTPEM,"Generally speaking, historical fiction can be fun.  Some of it is even well done.  The Tudors, for example, never kept us guessing what would happen to Anne Boleyn, but the drama remained.  Here...eh... not so much.  This is the story of a bunch of back-biting, scheming, calculating women who, though they appear to possess brains are used much the way breeding stock is used (to produce offspring).  Their opinions or desires are not really important.  But that doesn't stop them from being scheming malevolent witches.  There are so many women who look alike that it's hard to keep the plots straight, and while we like King Eddie, Queen Betsy is a bit much to take.  Okay, I know you can tell this was posted by a man.  My wife likes this show, and that's why we watch it.  If you are a man (or identify with a man) then you likely will find this better than Melatonin.  On the other hand, if you are a woman, you may enjoy it.  I did not.",1471824000,,943,4.38728323699422

I am not a prude by any means, but the topless women in every episode seemed unnecessary. The sex scenes were fine, but as a viewer, I found them somewhat lacking in passion. The nudity seemed more of a screen for the lack of passion than actually adding to the sexiness and heat of the scene.

I marathon watched this series in two days. Be warned, it is somewhat addicting. Thankfully it was only one season or my productivity would have seriously suffered until I completed the series.",1471046400,,688,4.725

I can't believe they showed the rape scene of a young underage girl!!  That is what lost it for me!!.. With the boys mother looking on!!? I think she was 15!  I'm actually open minded, but less is more in many cases.  And when it is ok to show young girls being hated and raped? That is sick, not entertaining!!  What kind of show is this??. WTF!!!

5649870,4,B00BMRTPEM,"Although it spent more time focusing on the witchcraft supposedly practised by Elizabeth Woodville and her mother, Jacquetta of Luxenbourg, than admitting to Queen Elizabeth's rather glaring personality flaw (in my opinion Warwick was made to look pettily jealous of her rather than righteously aggrieved by her shameless nepotism), I thought this season scored highly on historical accuracy as well as entertainment value. Can't wait for Season 2!",1470787200,,448,5.602941176470588

It's not like it's historically accurate, women didn't shave at all and men certainly didn't  have waxed chests.  I want the STORY, not blurbs between sex scenes. Sex is not the story, it's only about 10% of the story and there are SO many ways to represent it without being basically soft porn. Didn't even finish the series because of it. Which is a shame, because it has so much potential.",1470009600,,459,4.518072289156627

5650115,3,B00BMRTPEM,"Note: This review is only based on the first 2 episodes

On the plus side, it does look pretty - the sets, the costumes, the actors, the camera work - it's all very nice, and the acting is good.

But the characters don't have much depth - even the main characters - so it gets pretty dull pretty quick. Good characters are smiling and pretty, bad ones are sneering and ugly, the family members, aside from the mother, are just basically props - even the sex and the witchcraft is kinda boring, which doesn't, I think, bode well for the rest of it, so I'm stopping.

Though if you're just looking for some fluffy middle-ages romance at the end of the day, definitely give this a shot. It's not bad, by any means; it's just not for me.",1469318400,,733,4.297101449275362

5650148,5,B00BMRTPEM,"For people who love period pieces, this one is excellent. It is the thing the Brits do so welltell their own history. The White Queen covers the period from the end of the War of the Roses (1470s-1485) to the rise of the Tudors. It is filled with malice and Machiavellian cunning. Three women wish to be Queen. Elizabeth is a stunningly beautiful widow whose looks beguile the young king, Edward York. They marry without permission, and Elizabeth becomes queen. At the same time Margaret Beaufort connives to have her son, Henry Tudor, seated on the throne. She manages to accomplish this feat, but not without suffering. The third woman, Anne Neville, is perhaps the most evil. She whines, wheedles, and lies her way onto the throne. The acting is superb. The costumes and settings are excellent. The story moves at a quick pace. This is a show that is best for binge watching. There are many characters, and if you do not see the episodes close together, you will not be able to tell one male from another.",1469232000,,1008,4.636871508379889

5650174,4,B00BMRTPEM,"I am huge fan on British history up until the Stuart era and have been reading about Elizabeth Woodville and the Cousins Wars for years and the only thing that I can say that this show does accurately is give you a good idea of the timeline of how things came to be and the impact that all this war and fighting had on Elizabeth and her children.  I've always felt bad for her since because of this conflict she lost two brothers, her father, her first husband, three of her sons, and was forced to go through so much hardship.  This show gives you a good idea of how the women must have felt going through all this.
Having said that I will give some criticisms.  First, this show does a very poor job in showing the maneuvers of the English court and how many retainers the English royalty had.  Like theTudors did a good job of showing that at least.  Here it just looks like th actors are in medeival times.  Second, the thing where they have Cecily Duchess of York completely favoring George and then Richard has no real basis.  The part where she says I can make George king is based on a rumor and a statement one ambassador made at the time, that was probably false, because the Duchess was well known for being an extremely pious woman and would never have admitted to having had an affair.  Plus Edward is believed to have looked like the Duchess while Edward's brothers looked like his father (as in future Richard would attest that Edward was a bastard because he looked nothing like the former duke of York).  Though true that Duchess Cecily was opposed to the marriages it is widely believed that those feeligs dissipated in future since she ended up spending alot of time with the Queen in EdwardVI's reign.  She didn't even go to Richard III coronation, and mentioned neither of her younger sons in her will.  The only thing she mentioned was that she was honored by her son his majesty the kiNG eDWARDvi of England.
Thirdly, not that the Woodville's got what they came for, but they weren't as perfect as the show seemsto portray them.  They were too aggressive in placing their political influence, and made it very clear that they had no intention of letting Richard make decisions, effectlvely alienating him before Prince Edward was even crowned.  Also they did marry their 19 year old son, John (who gets executed in ep 2) to the 60 year old widow of the Duchess of Norfolk, since she had a large fortune at her death, ironically she even outlived him.  This gave them the reputation of money grabbing family, and there were instances where the father delibrately crushed people in his way.  Though Ill say that they were alot better than Warick who this show captured quite well.  He wanted to have power for himself through Edward and when Edward made it evident that he wasn't going to be pushed around Warick switched sides.  Also historians mostly see the Warick being pushed aside not because of Elizabeth Woodville's influence but because of Edward's desire to emphasis his power
Oh and Richard and Elizabeth. . .  No just no.  Even back then it was frowned upon for a niece to marry her uncle.  I mean why did they have to go that far I dunno.  Anne Neville in real life actually liked her nieces and recieved them in great favor, and Richard according to texts seems to have tried to make Henry tudor look stupid by having Elizabeth appear in court dressed lavishly in order to spread rumors that there was an intended wedding.  Richard needed the power of the people's opinion more than anything at the time since his son was dead and tUDOR was already getting alot of support.
I like this show since it gives u a rough idea of the politics of the time and gets people interested in teh period/  And i think this is an interesting era because it literally paved the way for the ideas and religious change that startedt o happen in England during Henry VIII era.  Elizabeth of York raised Henry to make him aware that women were capable thinkers and he recognized their power, although he asserted that males were better, he did recognize his daughters' right to inherit thr throne later.  So yeah this show is a good watch",1468972800,2,4153,4.527443105756359

5650176,5,B00BMRTPEM,"I'm a big fan of Phillipa Gregory's books and this series was well done. It combines the stories of Anne Neville, Margaret Beaufort, and Elizabeth Grey. If you want to find out what happens with the story at the end of the series, you'll have to read the books ""The White Princess"" and ""The King's Curse"", also written by Gregory. The series itself was done as well as Showtime's Tudor series (also available on Amazon) with beautiful costumes, amazing castles and scenery, and of course, it has alot of racey scenes too.

I keep fact checking with online histories of the Wars of the Roses, and it seems to be keeping to the facts with the main storyline.  The witch part adds some dimension too.  I really like it as a followup after finishing Game of Thrones this season.  And a great prequel to The Tudors.",1468540800,,409,4.413333333333333
5650320,5,B00BMRTPEM,"This is a dramatization of the Wars of the Roses, which were fought over the throne of England in the 15th Century. It's told from a woman's point of view, specifically, that of Elizabeth Woodville, the ""White Queen."" The history of those wars rivals any romantic fantasy you can name, with love and betrayal, good and evil, and general greed for power played out against a legendary background. The writing is strong, the acting is excellent and the story follows the historical outline closely. Though violence is an essential part of the history of these times, there's not a lot of graphic violence depicted. There are tasteful (by today's standards)  sexual scenes. The romantic elements are given focus, though the other story elements are not neglected. The real Elizabeth  was accused of witchcraft during her reign and the series depicts her as actually practising the art at crucial points in the story. Most of these correspond to events the historical Elizabeth was accused over, so this is a fun element. I enjoyed the series immensely.",1468540800,,1049,4.988571428571428

5650420,3,B00BMRTPEM,Could be entirely as absorbing and historical without the sex scenes.,1467763200,,69,5.363636363636363
5650421,4,B00BMRTPEM,"First the Middle Ages did not have zippers.
 They do have all of the people in the saga required to show how Richard III became England's king. Richard's body has been exhumed so it is clear that he did have a hunchback a very crooked back and these deformities were the strong motivation for his actions. However Richard had a good reason to murder the princes in the tower but there is no.proof that he did. The fact that this  production chose not to show his deformities was a mistake. The sexual scenes are graphic, gratuitous and totally unnecessary. But I still recommend you watch this video because it is beautiful, devoid of history accuracy, but enjoyable nonetheless.",1467763200,9,679,4.745762711864407

5650439,5,B00BMRTPEM,"Four queens vying for power and multiple noble houses clashing for the ultimate glory ... the crown of England, after the War of Roses. I personally could have done without some of the sex scenes but the characters stay true to form throughout, and the calculation, betrayals and ever present danger will keep you on the edge of your seat.

Some of the most unnerving moments occur as the women in one camp or another see their men ride off to battle and then wait ... sitting alone in a dimly lit room ... waiting for the returning rider with news that they are the new queen, or that all is lost (husband, land, access to their children, personal freedom and possibly their lives).  You feel it along with them.  Things could go many different ways at many points in the struggle..

Helpful Hint:  Avoid any unwanted spoiler alerts by NOT reading any of Shakespeare's plays while in the middle of watching season 1.  :-)",1467676800,,922,4.557575757575758

5650459,4,B00BMRTPEM,"The story is mostly accurate historically. The acting is very good, some of the actors are new to me, some are familiar. I don't think the witchcraft is truthful but adds an interesting twist. To me the nudity is not necessary, the kings and his court were very provocative evidently also. Lots of intrigue and side flipping. Henry Tudor's mother is intense to say the least, good actor! England has a very tumultuous history, and violent!",1467504000,,439,4.7894736842105265

5650791,4,B00BMRTPEM,"i watched for sheer entertainment, without in depth knowledge of historical facts, and was VERY pleased with series. I couldn't go to 5 stars becasue, for me, it was too compressed. I would have liked to see this over several seasons with more character development.

***SPOILER ALERT*** The Kings/Queens where whipped on and off the thrones so fast, and so much ""the people are saying"" was referred to, assuming they meant the ""townspeople"" or who ever they were supposed to be kinging and queening over, but I am uncertain I saw a single ""townsperson"" or villiager or any one else than the servants, or guards or heirs and battles men. Having said that, if you are watching this just for the King/Queen aspect, you are good to go. I agree with others that it ended kind of abruptly, but the whole series was kind of abrupt, to me.

Again, not vast knowledge of historical accuracy, but for me the costuming and every other thing visual seemed so deeply developed, elaborate, engaging.

5650909,5,B00BMRTPEM,"This is an excellently done series. The characters are all very interesting and they manage to make history seem like something that's happening now. There is quite a lot of explicit sex, but oddly, though I usually think that stuff is kind of gratuitous, in this it works because they don't exploit it. Evidently, there was less privacy for Kings and Queens. Plus, the sex, childbirth and head chopping, horrible war all bring to life what a physically punishing life these people led. The costumes are fabulous as are the sets. The script is wonderful, it's always easy to keep track of the story.",1466467200,,599,4.769230769230769

Most treatments use poetic license and oft time vivid imagination to ortray people and times. As I have only seen the first installment I may have to come back and re visit this review. However I found this first episode a bit ""forced"". Why is it when the series will go on for multiple episodes the stitching between events has to be so abrupt or forced. Within the first hour 2 major battles are waged, the king makes the damsel his bride and everyone somehow finds ""peace"" among rivals. Really??????",1466467200,,638,4.556521739130435

I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and professionalism of this one. Even though The White Queen isn't technically a historical drama, a lot of the characters were real people in the history of the Royal lineage. Many facts have been rearranged by the script's poetic license but you still get a feel of realism throughout the storylines of each of the families at court.

This series follows the books of Phillipa Gregory.  They have been very popular reads but I have not read them as yet.  I do not know how closely they resemble the books.  I am more into history and this series has a strong enough line of history in it that when it strays from the historical aspects that it is forgivable and even enticing (it is fiction).  I could have gone with a few less sex scenes and it has a few lulls in it but not enough to lose my interest.

5651247,1,B00BMRTPEM,"The one star is not because the acting or the plot line were not good.  In fact they were both really amazing.  The one star is for the amount of nudity and sex scenes that were just not necessary.  The number of sex scenes and graphicness of them did not add to the plot line, it only made the series seem trashy.  I really wish the producers, writers, and directors would realize that by adding such scenes only reduces their audience.  I have 3 daughters that would have loved to watch this show, but there is no way they could.  Honestly, no adult should be watching sex scenes like this either.",1465862400,11,599,4.351351351351352

Story is pretty engaging & does keep viewer interested. Language isn't terrible & at least 1 topless scene per episode. Show just nowhere near Game of Thrones or Spartacus.....both MUCH better shows.",1465689600,,375,4.875

5651612,4,B00BMRTPEM,"A decent way to spend time if English court period pieces appeals. Not BBC quality (though they were involved in production), but instead classic Starz quality. No subtlety to the plot lines or performances, and much of the cast is very young. Being unfamiliar with the ""war of the roses"" period of Britian helped. Not near award winning quality, but still enjoyable for us period buffs.",1465257600,,387,4.878787878787879

5651627,5,B00BMRTPEM,"The series' name 'White Queen' and cover photo are unfortunate because it looks like another Hobbit or magic-based fantasy. In reality, this is a loosely historical presentation of the War of the Roses, done in the same genre as 'The Tudors' and 'The Borgias'. The actors are wonderful, the writing is acceptable, the sets and costumes are quite good, and the photography is exceptional.

5651714,4,B00BMRTPEM,"If people are so hypocritical of the love/sex scenes and they are finding it as taboo, then you are all in denial. The royalty, then and now are subjected to so many mistresses in their courts that even Henry the Tudor was forced to divide the Christian religion so he can have a divorce and marry another queen. I find the acting and setting more appealing, and the sex part, it is just reality. If you never had sex in your life, then I can't blame you, but you are missing a lot, but if you have and can not take it with the story, then you are missing the part where everything in life is put together to complete the story...Remember this is a rated MA, so don't expect a mickey mouse story!",1465257600,,696,4.201492537313433

5651740,2,B00BMRTPEM,This series wasn't too bad but it was more like part soft porn soap opera and part cheesy romance novel. It would've been much better if most of the explicit sex scenes were removed entirely and they let the story line and the actors/actresses be the focus.  The later episodes were much better than the first two or three.  Not a series I would buy again and not interested in seeing any future seasons of this series.,1465171200,,419,4.428571428571429

There are queens and wars galore, and plenty of political intrigue at court.  For a time, I had the fun of living in the British ""midlands"", and visited the castle of the Earl of Warrick, the ""kingmaker"" depicted in this series.

5652113,4,B00BMRTPEM,"Kings and queens are challenged and challenging in TheWhite Queen to do o what's right by those close to them, their families, and their subjects, in that order. As much as the story focused on the nobility and the fragility of the human condition, the regents demonstrated repeatedly how egocentric their interests were.

5652155,5,B00BMRTPEM,"This ten episode miniseries is based upon three of Philippa Gregory's best selling historical fiction novels, ""The White Queen"", ""The Red Queen, and ""The Kingmaker's Daughter (The Cousins' War)"". The cast is simply terrific, giving outstanding performances, overall, and the production values are excellent. As this is historical fiction, and not a documentary, one should expect there to be historical inaccuracies and one will not be disappointed. It is historically  accurate in terms of big picture type, main events, but from there it somewhat digresses. Nonetheless, it provides a gripping storyline that will have the viewer riveted to the screen.

This miniseries covers the reigns of Kings Edward IV and Richard III of England. It also covers the ascension to the English throne of Henry Tudor. It focuses on three women who were to have some influence. First, there is the beautiful Lancastrian widow and commoner, Elizabeth Woodville, who would secretly marry King Edward IV of the House of York. Then there is wealthy Margaret Beaufort, the religious fanatic who would stop at nothing to make her exiled  son, Henry Tudor of the House of Lancaster, King of England. Last but not least is Anne Neville, obedient daughter of Warwick, known as the Kingmaker for his success in making his cousin,  Edward IV,  King of England. She would first marry Edward of Westminster, only son of the deposed mad King of England, Henry VI, and Margaret of Anjou. Widowed,  she would later marry Richard, youngest brother of King Edward IV, who would later become King Richard III.

While some of the machinations of these women may strain credulity, it makes for a very entertaining television miniseries. Some of these machinations are  based on historical fact, while some are not. This why it is historical fiction, with the operative word  being ""fiction"". There is some nudity, which is gratuitous for the most part, but it is fairly minimal given the fact that this is a ten part miniseries. Those with an interest in this period of English history, or who simply enjoy interesting, well done  historical fiction, will love this miniseries.",1464393600,73,2141,5.091428571428572

5652169,5,B00BMRTPEM,"This is an excellent series and features a very intelligent script matched with fine dramatic performances. It effectively explores the role of women in in a complicated period of English history, and while it may vary at times from the strict historical record, the overall effect is highly entertaining. The major production companies need to keep producing such high quality period dramas, especially in series format so that character development and relationships can be fully portrayed. And the battle scenes were kept to a minimum with the emphasis being kept on story, plot and dialogue. The true test is that this series left us satisfied and yet wanting more episodes. Overall highly recommend.",1464307200,,704,5.238938053097345

5652181,3,B00BMRTPEM,"While I enjoyed the series, I found the character of Elizabeth to be a bit weak.  (Minor Spoilers Ahead)  She was portrayed as exercising very little power over her female subordinates. Contrast her with Anne Neville as queen. As the series drew to completion, I found myself wanting to fast forward to the end because I felt Elizabeth the elder's behavior was out of character.  With that said, I still found it worth binge watching.  The romance and historical setting was enjoyable.",1464307200,2,485,4.878048780487805
5652182,4,B00BMRTPEM,It has been really good but not quite as beautiful photography as Outlander.

5652183,2,B00BMRTPEM,Couldn't make it past the 4th Episode.  It had promise with Witchcraft and War but it took the social side way too much for my liking.  She is marrying this guy to further their blah blah blah.,1464307200,,193,4.1891891891891895

I found a few more, and that was in the first episode alone.  I stopped there.  Can't an expensive production find funds for capable researchers? The photos of the cast tell the real story, right out of an article in People Magazine for the world's most beautiful people.  I read the book and even it was a light read, but I had little aversion to it.  This series however was not watchable, particularly the myriad love scenes that were offensive because, for one thing, they lacked the chemistry of soul.  Ugh.",1464134400,4,662,4.71304347826087

This especially shows up when an actor has a quiet voice. I especially like when I mute the screen it gives the local actors; nice trick!
the scene when the Queen's mother is dying and she is giving life and puts her baby on her mother's stomach.  It actually brought a tear to me.  You can never give enough ""dates"" when it is an historical entity!",1463788800,,509,4.260416666666667

While the story involves 3 women, Elizabeth Woodville, Margaret Beaufort, and Anne Neville, the story is told largely from the point of view of Elizabeth Woodville (the White Queen).

5652417,4,B00BMRTPEM,"Just finished watching Season 1of the White Queen. If you take into account all of the mystery and unknown facts about Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville's reign, the show was mostly historically accurate. I really liked how they played out the Battle of  Bosworth Field against Henry Tudor. Well played imho.
A lot of things left out, but if you are looking for some history combined with drama, this seems like a good start. I cant seem to figure out if there are more seasons though!
Also, a lot of unnecessary nudity and graphic scenes, so watch your eyeballs. I did not need to see the actual removal of a baby from a womb. o. O",1463356800,,632,4.448275862068965
5652418,2,B00BMRTPEM,"While I love history and am interested in the events,  the sexually explicit episodes prevail in this season. Even though the actors play really well I don't appreciate watching sex or nudity on the screen and it really takes away from the value of the history portrayed. Thus, I can only give 2 stars. The rating for the season should be double R, if there was such. In my opinion, it's even inappropriate for married adults such as myself.

The story is told from the viewpoint of Elizabeth, the woman he marries, and several other people. A beautiful commoner, Elizabeth becomes Quen of England.

I think the acting was good, and even if it wasn't stellar, it is an enjoyable show. The costumes and scenery are enjoyable and you just get wrapped up in the show.  I am sure there are things a true history buff could find problems with, but if you are watching this with the idea of leisure in mind, then you should like it. MUCH better than other dramas trying to be like it---for example Reign. I would place this one close to Showtime's The Tudors.",1463356800,,665,4.1

Like the enemy is my friend then my friends are my enemies down to brothers and
sisters to daughters and sons and of course to keep the fortunes amongst themselves
lets screw around with each other before and after the marriage and divide the wealth
amongst each other while killing and screwing each other with non stop envy, jealousy
and lust for power, plotting and driven by animalistic fanatisism for more and more
some goes way beyond our daily political hypocrisy by playing both side and against
each other ensuring that no matter who loses or wins they will always come out of ahead
while they slaughter their temporay kings or their benefactors who brought them to their
previous level. Full of suprises twist and turns with Shakespearean complications and with
intriguing never ending drama, tragedy and triamp the rise and fall of the nobles from the
highest to the lowest with casanovian passion between with and anything goes.
Even Sherlock Holmes or Colombo would be challenged to figure out their deveous spider
webs their deceitful plans and deeds.
I gave 4 stars for all that above but it deserve 5 star I withheld one because of the
battle field products were a little lower quality production than the norm but you don't
even ant to notice that's being way overshadowed by the whole production.
You won't be disappointed and you can't wait to go to the next episode.

I am a realist, but some of the scenes bordered on pornography and, frankly, victimized women. When we have to resort to unnecessary nudity to make a story, we need to ask ourselves where we have missed the boat in having to use so much of that kind of filler.

5652563,5,B00BMRTPEM,"For persons with some general knowledge of 15th Century England, this is a highly interesting and entertaining miniseries. For those who are not, the profusion of dramatis personae, many of whom share first names, may be confusing, especially when their changing aristocrat titles are thrown in as well. Nevertheless, kudos to Philippa Gregory, upon whose books the miniseries is based, for sorting out the many persons and their even more numerous intrigues. The story is set during the Wars of the Roses  the seemingly interminable civil battles between two branches of the royal house, those of Lancaster and of York, to secure the throne of England. The Yorkists used the white rose, and the Lancastrians the red rose. Edward IV (1461-1483), the male protagonist was a Yorkist, which explains the title of the series, White Queen, even though his Queen Consort, Elizabeth, was a Lancastrian. By all accounts Edward was a tall and handsome man, and an able king who ruled effectively and who sponsored scholarship and art. Elizabeth was by most accounts one of the most beautiful women of all England. The Wars of the Roses ended when Lancastrian Henry Tudor defeated Richard III and became king Henry VII and married Elizabeth, daughter of Edward IV and Elizabeth, Yorkists. In addition to Philippa Gregorys historical novels, interested audience may well find Shakepeare fascinating and enlightening (the three parts of Henry VI and Richard III, though none centered on Edward IV).",1462838400,,1486,5.16597510373444

my mind's description anyway. She did a good enough job. This series actually combined two books partially and
was not accurate to the book in many ways. The main inaccuracy was the ""little"" prince Richard returning home.
He may have been the guy in the second book of the series who they believe is Richard but he dies and then the
prophecy/curse takes effect.",1462579200,,476,4.678571428571429

Given the time period its only  natural some scenes and dialogue  have been editorialized, some facts, private moments, conversations cant be known, but I think the story line was well researched and the costumes fit the period (with the exception of a visable zipper here and there).

For the most part, their ""English"" is pretty understandable and, while the sex scenes are pretty graphic, at least the couple is married.

5652632,5,B00BMRTPEM,"Dramatic, romantic, conniving... that basically sums up every single character in this show. It's the PERFECT combination of character traits. The story of families switching loyalties to survive in a cut-throat society where noble households compete to see who can capture (and keep) the crown is classic, but the writers of this series excel in keeping the viewer intrigued.

5652642,4,B00BMRTPEM,Full disclosure I have read all the Phillipa Gregory books that the series is based on so I am biased towards Phillippa Gregory.  I love her books a historical fiction and fluff reading romance novels even if they are fluff. The series combines severals novels into a mini series and since it follows the books and is BBC and Stars there are alot of sex scences and nudity. But it does follow the books well. However it is combining several books at once and each book follows a different woman in history at the same time period but the mini series follows just Queen Elizabeth Woodville/York and cuts back to the other woman which marginalizes the other woman from the books.,1462406400,,677,4.595041322314049

5652654,5,B00BMRTPEM,"As a fan of historical drama and a guilty anglophile, this is right up my alley. I enjoy seeing the venality of the ruling classes, the pomposity, scheming, bloodthirstiness, lying, bowdlerizing, amoral antics of those whom Creation has cursed with great wealth and good looks. I enjoy the squandering of power on the mental shoving matches as one cranberry brain after another jostles for the crown, only to descend even further into degenerate glory.

These folks wrote (and continue to write) much of world history and understanding them is important to anybody who may eventually be left to carry on with whatever remains of our maimed, screwed planet. The lessons are many. Beautiful though the trappings may be, the undercurrent of perversion is constant. Look out for oneself, and to the block with everybody else. Western Civilization at its brightest and the legacy that lingers portends a harsh reality for all who are not of the right 'House' -  (or race or color). The filming is pretty, the acting is fine, the direction well done. Battles are depicted without excess of vista, extras or SpFx, which is fine by me.

A detailed discovery of the 30 year war between two main family branches that leads to the next era of power and ultimately connected to present day.

5652904,3,B00BMRTPEM,"It started off well but began to drag because of the endless exposition. For a story presented through the eyes of the women, the strongest and most interesting character was still a man (Richard). All three of the actresses who portrayed the queens were bland and unsympathetic, so it was difficult to connect with their plights. If you're interested in British history, as I am, it's worth a watch to see how they present the story, but if you're expecting an adventure or a romance, I'd suggest skipping it.",1461974400,4,510,4.741573033707865

5652924,4,B00BMRTPEM,Historic drama is my favorite production to watch.  The White Queen is a realistic in it's content with all the trappings of a more costly series.  The characters are believable and their performances make you want to see the next episode.,1461888000,,239,4.804878048780488

5652930,5,B00BMRTPEM,"This is really a fantastic series. I wish they had a season 2 but I understand why the story ended. I bought this for my mother for Mothers Day and she absolutely loved it.

5652939,3,B00BMRTPEM,"I watched all 10 episodes and did enjoy the series. It was exciting and kept my interest. However, it jumped too rapidly from one event to another. Some of the events could have been fleshed out; this would have made a longer but better series.

Rebecca Ferguson who plays Elizabeth Woodville and later Queen Elizabeth, was amazing in this series. She is a terrific actress with wonderful depth. She is also a great beauty.  Some of the others were pretty good, but she is on a level above them all. Max Irons plays Prince Edward. He certainly looks the part of a prince. His acting is not very remarkable, however. I will say he got better as he went along. By episode 6 he was much better, although no match for Rebecca Ferguson.

Unfortunately, Amanda Hale, the actress who plays Margaret Beaufort, had too big a part for her acting ability. She got somewhat better towards the end but not nearly good enough for such a big part. I found her facial expressions and gestures very irritating.

Regardless of some poor acting at times, this is a good series to watch. I debated between giving this 3 or 4 stars.",1461801600,,1111,4.54

People are way too neat and clean for the era, however, if you know little about the period, it demonstrates well the dynamics of feuding which existed among extended family members and the lengths some would go to gain power and wealth for themselves and immediate family.

The series covers a lot of history really fast so one can get lost at times in a sea of characters. I did do some reading to figure out who people were and ended up spoiling a few surprises. Still, it is really well done with only a few shortcomings. See it if you have time, you'll feel much more acquainted with the 'War of the Roses' and that time in the history of England.",1461715200,,464,3.989247311827957

All those who were engaged in these power struggles could not escape taking one side, or to survive, even both sides of their extended family feud. Everyone had relatives who had been killed. Everyone had times of danger and betrayal. The women focused on here had the most to lose. But, unlike an equally engaging civil war - The Game of Thrones - this war actually occurred wearing out all of England's resources and all of their people. Be prepared for romance, danger, a touch of magical belief, and tragedy. Enjoyed best at home on an dark windstorm day.",1461715200,,696,4.713114754098361

It was bloody but then I am sure there was plenty of that with that type of hand to hand combat.  I'm always bothered by mixing fact and fiction.

Though some of the female leads were over the top manipulative to the point of becoming annoying, I watched the entire series because I love period dramas. I did not read the books so cannot comment on how closely the books were followed. But it's a show using violence, sex and intrigue to draw an audience. I get that historical accuracy will not be followed 100% of the time, so I went into it knowing it wasn't fully based on history books.",1461110400,,468,4.517647058823529

I don't know if it is me or the plot goes round in circles - King Edward goes off to war and returns to Elizabeth, his brothers betray him and then they are back, King Henry is going to get his rightful place - oh, no he is not, Henry's mother relies heavily on her husband but just as quickly she is caught by cheating on him for what seems like a continual over and over theme.

5653310,1,B00BMRTPEM,"What I thought might be a well-rounded period drama on par with The Tudors and The Borgias (both better shows by leaps and bounds) turned out to be only a slightly more sophisticated version of a bunch of toddlers tattling on each other and throwing tantrums every time they get their way. Only the setting and the costumes are better. What all of these whining characters demonstrate is utter lack of gratitude for the fact that compared to what it was like for the peasantry of the day, they all have it really good. Each of these charecters lives in a castle, each has all the money and resources they could want, and waited on hand and foot. But nooo, they have to be the king. Game of Thrones, also inspired from the infamous War of the Roses, does spectacular job of illustrating these themes and makes for far superior entertainment to boot. As to why this show flops:

The acting is middling all around even with professionals like James Frain (far better as in the Tudors, as medieval dramas seems to be his casting niche) - mainly because all of the characters are so one dimensional. There really is no one to root for in this whole affair. Anne, mother to Henry Tudor, is a delusional, sanctimonious harpy who is worse in her plotting due to the fact that she firmly believes she is on a mission from God. James Frain and his Lancastrian cabal relentlessly pursue the throne with utter ingratitude. Initially one empathizes with the hapless Lady Jane Grey, who has everyone against her from the beginning,but as she becomes more consumed by desire for revenge she gets less likable. Her husband, King Edward, seems sympathetic enough a character if you can ignore the fact that had Lady Grey not given him what he wanted he was fully prepared to rape it out of her. It is frustrating to watch the two of them continually forgive enemies that only exploit those opportunities to plot against them all the more. Edward becomes a common debauched, cheating monarch soon enough which ruins the audience' good will toward him.

5653313,1,B00BMRTPEM,this is soft porn with a historical plot. the directing is terrible and requires frequent nudity and graphic sex scenes to keep the attention of the audience. the acting is even worse. rebecca ferguson is seriously one of the worst actresses i've ever had the misfortune of watching.,1460592000,11,283,4.916666666666667
5653314,5,B00BMRTPEM,"Started it just for fun as I have always been a big fan of British History and ofcourse the fight for the throne of England. Have watched other series like Tudors as well, but this one by far is the best (till now). Great work by the actors and amazing portrayal of events. I love the fact that they kept it to 10 episodes only and didn't try to drag it long (like other series). Rebecca Ferguson plays the part of the White Queen amazingly. I can't think of any other who could have done this.

Hats off to the directors, actors, costume designers, and everyone who worked to make this series what it is. You guys rock!! Pat your backs...",1460505600,,639,4.2809917355371905

I feel the casting director did a good job of placing the right actors/actress in the right roles for the most part. After listening to the book on tape I was so surprise at how close the movie came to representing all the parts in the book.

5653333,1,B00BMRTPEM,"I mean, it's Phillipa Gregory, for crying out loud.

But even so, what in the world is with the whole - the ""witch"" character is our tragic heroine - wonderful wife & mother to her husband and children, justified in her anger, etc, whereas Margaret Beaufort is the conniving, angry, bitter woman, with them going so far as to have one of her husbands call her ""the most pious woman I know.""  What?  And Lady Cecily - the lady spent her days in a convent, for crying out loud - why make her the bitter, nasty mother-in-law?

And given the ridiculous over-porn saturation in this series, we're only going to throw in one of King Edward's mistresses, Jane Shore, but to excuse it with, oh, I have the appetite of a king, but I still love you most, my queen!  Really?  Give me a break.  The guy was a sex addict, so I'm surprised that they glossed over this, given all the excessive nudity the directors were bent on throwing at us.

5653517,4,B00BMRTPEM,"Let me say right at the outset that I am not overly concerned about historical accuracy in a TV drama series or a work of historical fiction.  I do enjoy the kind of speculation that Philippa Gregory engages in when the information available is inconclusive about a certain person or event. I am happy to run with any number of theories about the fate of the Princes in the Tower, I am OK with Perkin Warbeck being Richard of Shrewsbury, I am alright with Princess Lizzie having an affair with her uncle,  and I am OK with Elizabeth Woodville practicing witchcraft for real. I do draw the line at completely unattested, invented allegations like Henry VII raping his bride-to-be, but I am fine with all the rest, where there are historical rumors and allegations on which to base the speculation.  If this makes your blood boil, this show is not for you.

This series started out slow, but then gained momentum and finished very strongly, IMO.

I've read the three books this series is based on, and other books on the Wars of the Roses, so I had no trouble keeping the characters straight. I am not sure that this is a simple task for someone who has no knowledge of the period. Things move very quickly in the later episodes.
Here's my assessment of the strength and weaknesses of the show-

The Bad-
1) Visual anachronisms- Zippered dresses, concrete steps, men's jackets that look like they were bought from a department store, people without headdresses and such.

2) Some inexplicable decisions regarding the aging of characters- This series opens in 1464. Henry Tudor would have been a boy of about 7 at the time, and indeed at this stage he is played by a kid, and we see him go through various stages of growth. He is a young man of 28 when the series ends in 1485.  However, Richard III ought to have been a boy of 12 at the beginning of the series and a man of 32 at the end of it, but he is played by the same actor throughout. Likewise for the Neville sisters. Similarly, lady Margaret Beaufort looks the same from start to finish, but Elizabeth Woodville is aged a bit in the last couple of episodes .

3) Some events that took place are shown differently in the series, even though they are described correctly in the books. The execution of Hastings is left out for some reason (maybe to make Richard III look better?), and his attributes are given to Anthony Woodville. The historical Anthony was accompanying Edward V on his journey from Ludlow to London, and was arrested along the way, and later executed. Here, Anthony is in London, trying to broker some sort of deal between his sister and Richard and he is sleeping with Jane Shore. In reality, it is Hastings who had Shore as his mistress. I did not see the point of this distortion.

4) Budgetary Constraints - It showed in many ways. The sets and locations were underpopulated. The Battle of Bosworth Field had to be staged in a forest because staging it in a field would require more extras, horses and other props. The characters seemed to have a very limited number of outfits. The same buildings were being used to depict Westminster and Middleham and Clarence's residence. There just weren't enough  guards, servants, handmaidens and suchlike for it to look authentic.

5) Max Irons just isn't able to project the toughness and savvy of a monarch who lost and regained his grip on power twice during the course of the series.

That's a pretty long list of shortcomings.
Now, for the Good-

1) The agency given to the women. They are not appendages of the men. They are movers and shakers in their own right.

2) The cast- With the notable exception of Max Irons, the rest of the cast is very good.

Elizabeth Woodville is one of my favorite characters from the books and Rebecca Ferguson nails her completely. She is beautiful and smart and unforgiving and tough as nails. It isn't often that a character in film turns out just as you had imagined them upon reading the book.

Amanda Hale has a tough job trying to humanize a character that comes across a bit caricaturish in the books. Philippa Gregory evidently has Yorkist sympathies. The Lancastrians usually don't come across very well in her writings. Margaret Beaufort is fanatical and a bit of a hypocrite in the books, and though she retains those characteristics in the series, she also comes across as vulnerable and doubtful about the nobility of her purpose, which makes her less grating.

Aneurin Barnard makes a fantastic Richard III. As a nice guy who overreaches and does some questionable things and  finally sees his world disintegrate, he manages to be both morally ambiguous and oddly sympathetic. The shot of the dead staring eyes of Richard as he lies stripped at Bosworth will forever remain seared into my brain.

Rupert Graves is a riot as Lord Stanley. His dynamic with lady Margaret is great. He has the funniest scene in the series where he teases his wife about how Princess Lizzie is having an affair with her uncle. The way he pauses before describing the piece of gossip as ""juicy""  had me in splits.

3) The characterization of Princess Lizzie. Elizabeth of York is too much of a quiet, retiring, non-confrontational type in Tudor period writings. I loved that she is portrayed as a feisty teenager in this series who talks back to both her mother and future mother-in-law. She seemed so much like a regular headstrong rebellious teenager that I had no trouble forgiving her for doing inappropriate things like having a crush on her uncle and not showing a whole lot of consideration for her aunt.

On balance, I liked this very much . Aneurin Barnard has a new fan. The guy has a good singing voice. If only Richard and Henry had a sing off at Bosworth, it would save Princess Lizzy a lot of heartache.",1459123200,6,5768,4.6223091976516635

5653527,4,B00BMRTPEM,good show,1458777600,,9,4.0
5653528,5,B00BMRTPEM,"A co-worker recommended THE WHITE QUEEN to me not knowing that I am fascinated by the TUDOR era in England. I didn't realize THE WHITE QUEEN is the story of Edward IV and his commoner wife Elizabeth Woodville (the white queen of the series). I knew their story and the story of the Princes in the Tower and the rise of the Tudor kings.

THE WHITE QUEEN takes the basic facts and weaves a tale of romance, espionage, war, betrayal, lust and heartbreak. The general facts are there but the story is fictionalized to entertain the audience. I was totally hooked by the story, the actors, the setting and everything about this series. I already knew how things would turn out so I was curious as to how the story would be told. This was a remarkable time in English history when no one was safe and loyalties shifted by the day. Women often played a powerful role and their place in history has been overlooked and THE WHITE QUEEN attempts to remedy this.

It's a stylized mini-series to admire and behold. It's a beautiful and stunning series to watch. The actors are beyond compare and I only recognized one or two actors so it all seemed so fresh. The series is based on a novel by Philippa Gregory who has blended history with fiction and romance. Again, the basic facts are here but it's still a fictionalized account. Hopefully, this stunning series will encourage you to research the historical facts (as they are known). Truth is stranger than fiction.",1458691200,,1456,4.596153846153846

The acting is superb, the costuming and settings very authentic-looking (except of course that everybody looks way too clean and their teeth are too white and straight), and the scripts are well written and suspenseful.  And this is even tho those of us who know about the War of the Roses know how it all turns out.  I was especially pleased that Richard III wasn't portrayed as the hackneyed Shakespearean monster of yore but instead as the conflicted and complicated individual I'm sure he was.  Plus I think it was a brilliant move to keep us guessing as to who really killed the princes in the Tower.  Buckingham?  Richard himself?  Someone else who was trying to curry either Yorkist or Lancastrian favor?  After almost 550 years, unless some new information gets unearthed, we'll probably never know.",1458432000,,911,4.75796178343949

5653559,2,B00BMRTPEM,The series is based on Phillippa Gregeory's book The White Queen... to be fair the book was not one of her best either.  I generally really enjoy her books .  I was looking forward to the series but after watching it I feel like it just fell flat.  It was very dark and there is so much drama it  felt like nothing good ever happened to anyone.  Acting was decent but nothing to write home about.  Sometimes good acting can completely savory series but not in this case.  Overall it just felt so so,1458259200,,498,4.23404255319149

5653566,5,B00BMRTPEM,Love the series.  My  only complaint was to much gratuitous sex.  I could have done with all of the explicit scenes.  I don't really think it added that  much to the story.,1458259200,,172,4.25

I do, however, wish these shows would leave the sex to our imagination. I don't need to see the actual acts - this applies to Game of Thrones and so many others. I am so grateful that Downton Abbey did not have explicit sex scenes.",1458000000,,343,4.276923076923077

5653625,5,B00BMRTPEM,"Although much of the costuming is horrible, and Yorkist England never had sheer interior curtains on windows, there is at least an attempt at a reasonable presentation of material culture.  The cast is excellent save for the Wydville family; Janet McTeer is an excellent Jacquetta Wydville, but frankly the rest of the tribe is presented as too plain.  Sir Richard & Jacquetta were famed for their striking looks, and their entire family of children took after them.  The casting of Max Irons & Rebecca Ferguson is especially good; I really believed I was looking at Edward IV and Elizabeth.  Again, the production did not degenerate Edward nearly enough for his documented physical condition when he met his end; much like ""The Tudors"" didn't do Henry VIII justice at the end with Jonathan Rhys-Meyers' physical presentation.  The history overall is good; I'm not fond of the whole ""they really worked magic"" theme that pervades Philippa Gregory's books, but that's her choice to make & she is a huge publication success.  The actress who portrayed Margaret Beaufort did an especially nice job working with a character that reads rather flat in the histories.",1458000000,,1160,5.047120418848167

5653628,4,B00BMRTPEM,"Keeping all the Henrys and Edwards straight requires some attention but the series is visually ravishing (and various folks get ravished) and for what is essentially a prologue to Shakespeare's far superior plays, the series is well-done and evocative of England's stormy, late Middle Ages when the life expectancy of princes and kings was probably less than that of the average servant or soldier.",1458000000,,398,5.234375

5653648,4,B00BMRTPEM,This is a good series although I sometimes have to pause it and ask my husband what is going on because there are so many characters.  I didn't realize there was going to be nudity in it which is awkward every time it comes up in the show.

5653727,5,B00BMRTPEM,"First of all let me tell you that I love Amazon Prime, choosing my selection, putting on my headphones and watching my favorites.  The White Queen tells a story of breaking barriers and traditions to find true love.  Each epsiode is filled with historic plots to dethrone King Edward and how his brothers plot with him and against him to find their own selfish desires to rule Kingdoms and be wealthy.  Lots of lusty scenes gives way to lots of princes and princess's being born under King Edwards reign as King of England.  The costumes, set designs and acting is fabulous.  I wait for the next mini series hopeful of King Edwards daughter marrying the Tudor King and ushering in a time of peace.",1457568000,,697,4.588709677419355

I would have given this 5 stars, but felt the sex scenes were a bit much and almost made me feel like I was watching soft porn. I can appreciate artistic creativity when it comes to such scenes, but would have preferred for them to have been more of the suggestive type where you don't actually see individuals actively engaging in the act. Thankfully there's so much more to this series that will keep most individuals glued to their seats. If you've read any of the books in the series you will appreciate the snippets that help bring the characters to life as tidbits of the book reference are interwoven throughout the scripts. Overall a fascinating series to watch.",1457308800,,770,4.546762589928058

5653994,5,B00BMRTPEM,"This reveals just how dangerous life must have been for the royals during the 15th century. The viewer cannot help but feel that danger as the constant maneuvering goes on to gain the throne of England. King Edward marries a commoner who is labeled a witch. We get the sense of that possibility, inherited supposedly, from her mother with indications that she, Queen Elizabeth, has passed that ability on to one of her daughters. Of course superstition was rampant so it didn't take much, when her sister-in-law loses her baby boy (a precious commodity since that child would be in line for the throne) in childbirth, for Elizabeth to be accused of being a witch. Elizabeth, the White Queen,ner, is hated because she is a commoner and because she has the ear of the king. Needless to say the intrigue is relentless and exhausting. I can only imagine that life, difficult as it was in those times, was intensely more so in the house of royalty-never knowing where the next ""attack"" might come from. The women who play the major roles (Elizabeth, her mother Jacquetta, Margaret d'Anjou and Mary) give very fine performances. The minimally lesser roles of Isabelle and Anne also very well done. Max Irons, son of the actor Jeremy Irons and actress Sinead Cusak, is  King Edward. And even with his baby face, he is very convincing in the role. An excellent production",1456617600,3,1363,4.77542372881356

5653997,4,B00BMRTPEM,"One of my favorite periods in history - read about the Tudors, Yorks constantly. So, the story is pretty accurate. However, way too much T & A for a story that could stand on it's own without the lure of breasts, bare butts, and R rated sex scenes.  Why do the producers, directors, etc. feel it is necessary to embellish a fascinating period piece with unnecessary distractions? No woman who has birthed 12 kids looks that good. And Edward got fat - why are we not treated to that sight?
BTW: I'm no prude, and enjoy a week-toned body as well as the next. But, there is a time and a place.",1456617600,,590,4.267857142857143

5654005,5,B00BMRTPEM,Well done. Only thing I didn't like is they didn't do makeup on the actors to show they'd aged. This season spans many years and actors look the same through the entire show. The child actors of course changed over time.,1456617600,,220,4.390243902439025

Again, don't rely of this series for historical facts.

Writing was mostly excellent, though a few episodes toward the end seemed a little out of tune in the dialogue - then again, by that point in the story, with so many Edwards and Richards and Thomases running around, I suppose even a mother must refer to ""your brother Thomas Grey"" when speaking to another of her children. I haven't read Philippa Gregory's novels, upon which this show was based, but I'm definitely interested in doing so now. And it was nice to learn about royals that were lesser known to me - Henry VIII's parents, grandparents and so forth.

5654262,4,B00BMRTPEM,"The story line is very interesting and so are the characters. However, it is very dialogue heavy and their ever changing plotting and scheming can be a bit hard to follow if you aren't listening closely.

5654273,5,B00BMRTPEM,"I've only watched 2 or 3 episodes so far, but can't wait until I have the time to binge on this beautifully produced and well acted story.  I read the book and had a bit of a hard time visualizing the characters, but I may read it again now that I can put faces with names.  So far, it is faithful to the book and gorgeous to look at.  I can see why King Edward defied his family for Elizabeth, a beautiful, strong woman of great courage.  I happen to be an English history buff, but I can see how watching this series might make a buff out of those who thought they weren't particularly interested.  There is always a wide gap between fiction and history, but it often encourages one to seek out the reality after being so enchanted with the fictionalized version.  That's what happened to me at age 13 after reading a novel about Anne Boleyn.",1455580800,,844,4.276729559748428
5654274,5,B00BMRTPEM,Love it.  Thought it was difficult to follow Henry VIII's wives.  That is nothing compared to the battle between the York's and the Lancaster's.,1455580800,,144,4.958333333333333

5654278,4,B00BMRTPEM,"There are many good things to appreciate about this series, particularly the acting, but what knocks it down a notch in my eyes is that it turns the screenwriting mantra ""show, don't tell"" on its head.  We are constant witnesses to characters rushing on screen to ""tell"" an important character what has happened off screen.  We seldom get to see that important event happen, and when we do the producers screw it up.  For example, the ultimate Battle of Bosworth Field, which took place in August 1485, happens in this series in a forest with snow on the ground.  Please, producers, could you not find a field to film the battle in, and do it at an appropriate time of the year?",1455580800,,678,4.532786885245901

5654290,4,B00BMRTPEM,This show makes today's politics look tame. I was able to watch about one episode per day and that helped me keep all the characters and their relationships straight. Other reviews have told you what it's about. I think it well made and well acted and nice to look at.  Lots of Belgian scenery posing as England and lots of bodies on display.,1455580800,,342,4.428571428571429

5654300,4,B00BMRTPEM,Stayed pretty true to history. Characters are believable and the actors/actresses and well cast. Not an over abundance of fleshy sex season which a lot of these shows like to push now and I think that makes it a good fit for some who may not like those kinds of scenes.,1455580800,,269,4.294117647058823

5654382,5,B00BMRTPEM,"While sometimes the sword fights are interspersed without need, overall this is fun to watch, including sufficient surprises and twists.  The makeup staff deserves kudos for creating perfect looks depending upon the scenes; for example, Ms. Ferguson, at times, is elegantly beautiful and at other times is depressed, disturbed etc.",1455580800,,331,5.62

5654389,4,B00BMRTPEM,"A riveting tale, although it is quite liberal with historical accuracy.  It seems to have played up all the rumors and myths that were put out at during the reigns of Edward IV and Richard III concerning Elizabeth Woodville and her family, Mistress Jane Shore, Elizabeth of York and Richard III, and the fate of the younger of the two murdered princes, Richard Plantagenet.  Also, not for younger viewers due to a generous helping of graphic sex scenes and frontal nudity.  However, it still is a beautifully filmed story replete with beautiful faces, gorgeous scenery, and very gifted actors.  My critique is not meant to turn anyone away, as it is a pleasure to watch.  I have done so at least twice and will no doubt watch it several times again.  ,",1455494400,,752,4.659090909090909
5654390,5,B00BMRTPEM,"So far, I'm enjoying it immensely. I loved the novel -- it is one of Phillippa Gregory's very best books -- and I was afraid of soiling my pleasure in the book with a made-for-TV drama. But I was wrong. This is excellent.

I will say one mean thing: somehow, I don't think William Morris wallpapers were very popular in the 15th century. The excessive use of them on the sets makes for a very pre-Raphaelite feeling to the series. But I can overlook that. Everything else is superb.",1455408000,,482,4.415730337078652

5654393,5,B00BMRTPEM,"I have not read the books, and mention that so that it is clear that I watched the show with no expectations and nothing to compare it to.  I also have not studied the history of this time period, so I have no idea how accurate the events are.  But with that said, I completely enjoyed this series.  Taking the point of view the women who were influential behind the scenes during that time gives a unique point of view of the events.  I would highly recommend this show.",1455235200,,471,4.258426966292135
5654394,5,B00BMRTPEM,"I truly enjoyed the book series and the TV show. Its a very different look at Elizabeth Woodville and her King Husband as they simply try to survive in a civilized uncivilized world. Max Irons is lovely as the young King looking to make his mark on the world and The White Queen is on point through out the whole series. Honestly, 1 season was all it needed and continued the intrigue of what happened to this great family and the lost two boys in the Tower.

Enjoy and research what happened to them. Very interesting. A must have.",1455235200,,532,4.373737373737374

I found it such a fascinating period of history, especially as told through the eyes of women from several generations, and from opposing sides. This series carries on the stories told in the books at a deeper level, and really brings the characters to life. It took me a few episodes to really get into this series, but now, half way through, I am fully immersed in the drama and intrigue of political life at court. Having read the books, I enjoy knowing some of the political history that preceded this time period, and some of the personal histories of the characters in this show.

Lost of lives of loved ones, fear of the future of her sons, her husband's reign being questioned even by members of his own family, jealousy, envy, frequent wars to defend the reign... And, in the middle of all this, mysticism, the ability to foresee the dubious future and the anxiety, the uncertainty of not knowing if the visions were correctly interpreted or not.

5654586,3,B00BMRTPEM,"It was a pretty good show...for awhile. I just could not watch the last few episodes. Its sort of watching a bad horror movie..""Don't go into the closet"" ""Keep away from that door""  You see it coming from a mile away and get tired of knowing the outcome. It felt that way at the end of the series. The same old plot to be king or queen. Who not to trust, who is killing who. etc.

I really don't know what happened at the end, because, unlike a good candy bar, I could step away from this show.",1454544000,,494,4.030612244897959
5654587,4,B00BMRTPEM,"I adore Phillipa Gregory, so I was excited to see this. I've only read one of the books, though, that were used for source material. I thought they did a really cool job of representing the mystical ideas that Gregory presented in the White Queen (the book). But I think it was a little harder to digest as a tv show than it was as a book. Maybe it just wasn't the right medium for me. The characters aged decades during the single season, and major battle, perhaps even a whole small war could boil up and resolve in a single episode. It was a little hard to keep track of, and felt a little superficial. Forget time for character development, which I thought largely fell a little flat. The women depicted are truly amazing, and they were as well done as possible in the amount of time they had. Four stars for a great effort, but don't watch this right after Outlander, or you WILL be disappointed.",1454544000,,901,4.369047619047619

5654602,5,B00BMRTPEM,"The White Queen' has all the pageantry of GoT and all the Machiavellian plotting of HoC.
 I especially love that in 'White Queen' Richard III is a loyal and good-hearted man, turned into the  paranoid tyrant we know and hate by the crown, and that he is at last exonerated of killing his nephews.
I also love that the Kingmaker's daughters, raised as their ambitious parents' pawns, become equally obsessive and heartless players as adults.  In this world everyone is culpable and nobody deserves the crown, neither by incontrovertible blood right nor by superior kingcraft... it's all scheming, war, money, and politics.
 'The White Queen' makes an excellent companion piece to 'Lady Jane'  if you want to bracket the Tudors.  And If you want to follow the whole saga of bloodletting, ambition, and truly startling legal justifications that marked England from the death of Edward III to the coronation of James I, watch 'The Other Boleyn Girl' between 'the White Queen' and 'Lady Jane.'",1454457600,,988,4.9939024390243905

5654638,3,B00BMRTPEM,"To be honest, I have mixed feelings concerning this. Great acting, sets, escapist.

But for the love of God its almost hard to find someone to root for as the episodes progress. These entitled people with so much devote all of their energy to paranoia and suspicion rather than serving the people.

Why wasn't the kings brother happy with all that he had? Do they not see how short lived everyone's time on the thrown is? That there are other positions of power other than the actual crown and that they could spend their time actually doing good rather than plotting against each other?
If that is peer I do not want it, and feel a little guilty for the shadenfruede",1454284800,,667,4.5041322314049586

Picture quality was not good enough to continue watching.  I was not able to watch enough of either to give a good review.  My DSL is not fast enough to stream and receive an interrupted quality picture.

I am incredibly disappointed to find that they did not continue the show.  It is truly entertaining television.  If you like steamy, scandalous, period shows then you must watch this.  I am sure that there are a great many historical inaccuracies but it's a drama not a documentary. The main characters all existed and many of the events happened in real life as well. I loved every single actor they cast.  I think they did a great job.  I was so intrigued with this show I found myself doing my own research to find what had been the fates of all the characters. I was particularly interested in the mystery of the ""princes in the tower."" It's a very fascinating story of the emergence of very strong women in a world ruled by men.",1452297600,,862,4.316770186335404

Her acting at times was a bit flat, and there were some other things I'm hoping not to be as annoyed with when I re-watch it... .... someday.

So many of us are direct descendants of Edward IV and Elizabeth, and I know I am not alone thinking how amazing it is to watch their romance and lives play out on screen.

5655056,5,B00BMRTPEM,"The White Queen was simply superb.  So much attention is given to Henry VIII and Elizabeth I.  They seem to have overpowered the history of British sovereigns.  While fascinating in their own rights, what preceded and defined them included The War of the Roses, King Edward IV, his Queen Elizabeth, the Princes in the Tower, the downfall of the Duke of Clarence and ultimately King Richard III, and the marriage of the White Princess Elizabeth to Henry VII...so much happened during the time frame encompassed by the books.  The White Queen Season I led me to listen to all of the audio books in the series. I so wish the tv series continued for another season with The Red Queen, Margaret Beaufort.  She was quite a formidable presence in her own right.  Her invoking God's approval at every turn she makes by such tests as asking God to give her a sign if he disapproved of her plans, and upon neither hearing nor seeing such a sign, she believed fervently God approved.  Likewise, if something fortuitous happened, she could use to say it showed God's favor, too.  The books and tv series led me to a voracious appetite regarding history from this period.  It's fascinating to watch the ever constant attention to politics and  back room deals, religion and magic, familial ties.  Each book in the series adds different perspectives to the mix gives a broader and better understanding  the times.  Amazon would do well to produce the remaining books into additional seasons.  I do believe a continuing series would find quite the following.",1450483200,,1543,4.795454545454546

5655058,5,B00BMRTPEM,I really enjoyed this series. It was an interesting view of the history of the York and Lancaster conflicts. Seeing it through the eyes of the powerful women involved made me think of the history from a different perspective. Of course it is fiction but it is fun to speculate and the series put a personal spin on these women (even if it is not historically correct). Now I HAVE to read the books.,1450483200,,398,4.391891891891892
5655059,5,B00BMRTPEM,"Wow. I have seen many (many!) period pieces, most of them made in and about Great Britain, Brittany, England, etc. I was a huge fan of The Tudors on . . . HBO, I think it was? And while the acting on that show was fantastic, the acting on The White Queen was par excellence. And where I couldn't wait for the next romp with Henry's latest beauty on The Tudors, in The White Queen that kind of thing almost detracted from the overall story. No other historical epic got me digging into history like this one has. And the more I read about that particular era, the more astonished I was at how amazingly accurate the storytelling was! I can suspend disbelief with the best of them, but in this case, I didn't have to, and more importantly, the actual story is better than any dramatic retelling. And except for the witchcraft element - I haven't seen anything about that, although that doesn't mean it doesn't exist - it was true to form in nearly every instance - that is, about 99% of the time. That is far, far more than can be said of the vast majority of Hollywood fare telling us the story is ""based"" on a true story, or ""based"" on a novel. Well, if that were the case, why can I not recognize it from the source material?

Anyway, The White Queen excels in every arena - mystery, intrigue, action, drama, romance, and pretty much every other genre you can think of. I have already recommended the show to my best friends, and now I would like to recommend it to you. I promise, if you like period pieces like this, you will not be disappointed.",1450483200,,1549,4.323024054982818

5655067,5,B00BMRTPEM,"Great series. Very entertaining, and manages to be so without a lot of violence, which I found refreshing, since many of the current medieval-inspired series' are very violent (mind you, I enjoy them too, but this is a nice break from all that). Obviously, it's historical fiction, emphasis on the fiction part. Most of the characters are from real life, but their actual personalities are obviously invented by the author of the series or the screenplay writers. If that doesn't bother you, then I'd definitely recommend the series. The acting is, for the most part, excellent, the costumes are lavish, the sets are beautiful, and it manages to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole series.",1449273600,,708,4.908333333333333

5655266,4,B00BMRTPEM,"An excellent production of a very good adaptation of Philippa Gregory's novel.  The acting is strong and the depiction of Medieval England seems quite realistic.  Gregory's take on Richard of Gloucester (later Richard III) is novel --especially to those of us who first met him through the propaganda of Shakespeare.  What strikes us is how beautiful (and young!) King Edward and his Queen Elizabeth are.  Since it's a story of the battles of strong-willed and powerful women, it is short on blood and gore and very long on plotting and dialogue.  That makes it in a way more suspenseful, though perhaps less appealing to the Game of Thrones crowd.  It compares well to ""The Tudors"" and ""The Borgias.""  We can only hope that there will be a sequel, Gregory's ""The White Princess.""",1448236800,,780,4.863636363636363

5655408,4,B00BMRTPEM,"Meh. I like things that are historically acurate. I cringed while the characters spoke or wore nail polish...but otherwise, I'd say that although I like the actors in the Tudors better, this wone was better acted. The Tudors seemed to soap-opera for me.
Not sure what else to say about it. Season Two was cancelled probably due to lack of funds.
Everything pretty much seems like GoT wannabe shows and now boobs are acceptable on American TV so that's good. Now lets take away collateral damage, happy endings, and gore!
The white queen herself was fantastic.",1447286400,,559,4.833333333333333

There is no one to single out because they were all great.

5655543,5,B00BMRTPEM,"If you enter this with the anticipation of being well-entertained, not necessarily schooled, you can sit back and enjoy - very engaging and romanticized version of the story of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville. I did not know exactly what this was about until I started watching it (other than it was an icon in my Prime Recommended lists); I thought it was purely fiction but because of the historical bent, I enjoyed this much more than expected (like, immensely!). I agree with the other reviewers to take the history with a grain of salt, but it's intended to be a dramatization, not a documentary. It did pique my interest enough in the history to verify/research the context around it and to re-watch the Henriad*.  I found the angle from the female protagonists to give this a unique and effective spin. There is some nudity and sex, but not obnoxiously so, and might be appropriate for older teens or slightly younger with parental guidance. I do think it potentially could be a useful platform in engaging students in English history. Great casting.

* ""Henriad"" - For background to the conflicts and agendas in The White Queen, check out Shakespeare's trio of King Henry plays (Henry IV Parts 1 and 2, and Henry V) and Richard II which precedes these. I highly recommend The Hollow Crown video series (featuring Jeremy Irons and Tom Hiddleston), which is based on the Shakespearean plays. Another recommendation for the storyline toward the end of The White Queen is a stylized, alternative version of Richard III (Edward IV's brother) featuring Ian McKellen and Annette Bening.",1446336000,,1589,4.903345724907063

I personally believe that if you know your history, you are secure in viewing historical fiction (meaning you can decipher what is truth and what is just good television drama).  You will find yourself googling some of the historical figures just out of curiosity.  My only complaint, is that there were some gratuitous sex scenes they probably could have done without.

5655835,5,B00BMRTPEM,"This was another great show. I've watched the Tudors, Reign and this and it is all awesome. Especially since they take place in the same time period. Right now Reign is about Mary Queen of Scotts and her King Husband of France. Mary wanted the throne of England, but Queen Elizabeth, daughter of Ann and King Henry the 8th in the Tudors, became Queen when Queen Mary, Queen of England ( AKA Bloody Mary) died.

Shows like this are great for making people want to learn more about history. I didn't know much at all about the White Queen, but since I watched it after the Tudors I was interested in seeing it, since I read that her husband was King before the Tudors came to power.

I guess all I'm saying is this is a great show.",1444867200,,729,4.27536231884058

5655844,3,B00BMRTPEM,I really like movies in this time period. I do like this movie very much but I have only seen half of the series. What I hate about The White Queen is the fact they have to show full nudity of her breasts and the backside of the male actors. Also the bare action of making love. What the heck! Why ruin the whole thing and put nudity in the movie? It is NOT NECESSARY to put the nudity into the movie. Really bad for kids.,1444867200,,422,3.9186046511627906

My husband and I both really enjoyed watching this series; it was sumptuous and altogether addicting to see what would happen next. The screen adaption was done very well and the added focus on the main characters relationships with periphery character enhanced the story line. This series is refreshing because it takes place  just before the often done Tudor period. I would say the casting is superb, especially the actresses who play Elizabeth Woodville, Margaret Beauford and Anne Neville. I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a costume drama, excellent character development rounded out with realistic dialogue and rich depictions of historical events.",1444521600,,763,5.203252032520325

5656097,4,B00BMRTPEM,"The White Queen was true to the content of the books from which the story came. My one disappointment was in the casting of a few of the characters, most notably the Queen and the King. Elizabeth was beautiful, but not beautiful enough to control the King and a bit too old in years for the role. Likewise , the king was too youthful and not commanding in presence. The romance was lost with the casting.
The most sympathetic character was Richard, who was well-played and well-cast. The Neville girls were also well- received.

Although I enjoyed the series, there was so very much in the books that three different series would have been more appropriate.
I liked it. I could have liked it more.",1443139200,,697,4.576

I am glad that I started the first series after future series were produced because I can spend hours ""catching up"". I realize the era was one filled with bloodshed yet this series is very good at less ""blood and gore"" then innuendo's and veiled video sequences  that are acceptable yet realistic.",1442448000,,414,4.914285714285715

5656288,4,B00BMRTPEM,Great story telling of the War of the Roses.  Series merged 3 books by Phillipa Gregory.

5656306,4,B00BMRTPEM,"Saw this a little late to the party, after Rebecca Ferguson had gained more international notoriety--especially as female lead in Mission Impossible-Rogue Nation.  She, and the whole cast (especially the wonderful Janet McTeer) are very fine, as one expects from British period productions.  I enjoyed the first half of the episodes and then my interest waned, although I pushed through to see how the series would wind down.  I especially liked that the POV was of the women involved in the War of the Roses--a bit like engaging with a classic story a la ""Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern are Dead.""",1441843200,,596,5.0

5656310,4,B00BMRTPEM,"Thoroughly enjoyed this series!!  Was absolutely hooked on it.  My only critique is that some of the dialogue and all of the hair, makeup and costuming just seemed too modern, and made especially the first episode or two a little corny sounding and not believable.  it seemed to improve as it went on, or either i just got used to it.  In the first episode, Warrick says to the King, ""Really?"" in a really sarcastic answer....that's a very modern day expression, and really lost credibility for me in the opening scene which is why i rated it 4 not 5.

5656366,4,B00BMRTPEM,"It was a really enjoyable take on history.  It made King Edward quite loveable although history says he wasn't very popular.  If you don't care about granular details, this is a romantic version of a time where people's only entertainment was plotting and scheming.

5656378,1,B00BMRTPEM,"I was unwilling to watch the show after viewing parts of episode 1 due to its scenes that would be spoke of as personal and private in nature in polite society.  These indelicate scenes ruined what seemed to be an informative plot in a much overlooked time in history, which done with more sensitivity, could have been an educational opportunity to young adults for whom it would be entirely inappropriate for them to view as the show is currently presented.",1441497600,3,458,4.725

5656389,5,B00BMRTPEM,"Really wonderful series! It is about the War of the Roses, a very tumultuous time in England, Wales and French history among both the ruling class and aristocratic families just as the Renaissance Period was about to begin. Filled with lots of accurate costuming, architecture, politics and some war scenes showing the true brutality of hand to hand combat with steel blades. Series is not consumed by battle scenes and their horrors but does not down play them. Rather they focus on the process and progress which led to them and the outcome of those decisions on a broader scale.  Ravages of intermittent plague are really not focused on in the first season but we're still prevelant during this period of time. Perhaps second season will give this history making its due. Really looking forward to the coming season.",1441497600,,819,4.892086330935252

5656443,3,B00BMRTPEM,"The plot is very good and great acting.  I really love the show, but have to lower the score sine there is way too much nudity.  There is no reason to show so much.  It seems they have a quota of having at least one bare breast each episode.",1441152000,,241,3.877551020408163

5656449,3,B00BMRTPEM,It doesn't compare to the Tudors series but I'm enjoying it. I just finished reading the White Queen and the Red Queen and this series follows the books pretty completely so far. Ms. Gregory developed the characters more fully of course and I wish there had been more onscreen chemistry between Elizabeth and Edward.,1441152000,,316,4.87037037037037
5656450,5,B00BMRTPEM,"Haven't finished the entire series yet, but what I watched so far have enjoyed greatly! I just finished reading The White Queen novel by Philippa Gregory, which this series is based on. I loved the novel and was very pleased at how well this series followed so closely to the novel. I love historical fiction and this series does not disappoint, the costume are wonderful, battle scene's very realistic and of course you have the age old problem that England has faced for centuries. The never ending struggle for the throne. Excellent series a must watch for anyone who loves historical fiction, especially British history.",1441152000,3,624,4.9523809523809526

5656455,5,B00BMRTPEM,"From what I understand of the period, the characters in this production and the quality of the productionitself were very accurate and engaging.  The only issue I had was that Richard III has scoliosis.  The character who played him clearly did not, and Richard's infirmity played a big role in his life and people's reactions to him.  Other than that...great work, well acted, and engaging.",1441152000,,391,4.984615384615385

5656476,3,B00BMRTPEM,The authors did not get me to care about the characters. It would have been more entertaining to watch the actors get together and have a meal together off camera than to watch the show.  The acting I believe was good but the writing was poor.,1440979200,,243,4.282608695652174

We were surprised at how much care was taken with historical accuracy, remaining for the most part faithful to facts as far as we know them. There is so much debate about what actually happened that it would be impossible to make any claims to complete historical accuracy, but this show did a very good job of trying.

5656556,5,B00BMRTPEM,"A dramatized but more or less accurate portrayal of the wars, uprisings, conspiracies, and plots unfolding in England during the mid-to-late 1400's surrounding the rise of the York family as monarchs and just prior to the Tudor's (that many may know from the Showtime series) assuming the throne. Overall extremely well acted, directed, and filmed. If I had to compare it to another modern series I'd say it's actually rather close to House of Cards as far as the story goes: centers on politics of the time, love affairs, and backdoor schemes for power. The only detractor is that it was a one season shot that covered the entire reign of the York's.",1440720000,,651,4.769911504424779

5656743,5,B00BMRTPEM,"A fantastic mini-series based on the novels about three strong, ambitious women. It's rare that movies or series devote themselves to the ambitions of women without portraying them in a malicious light. None of these women are perfect; however, their strengths, fanaticisms & ambitions portrays women as I've never seen before in their era. At a time when women were viewed as mere property--daughters to be married off for profit, given in marriage to men not of their choosing, submissive women used as pawns in the games of fortune--these women knew what they wanted. Almost every woman character in this series have iron wills of their own. And even when they don't have it in the beginning, they evolve and in the end, even to their own detriment, these women become forces to be reckoned with. Don't miss this beautifully adapted series. I've watched it a dozen times and each time, I marvel at some new tidbit that I'd missed in previous views.",1439856000,,951,4.840490797546012

5656777,4,B00BMRTPEM,"I liked it a lot.

The extended sex scenes aren't necessary. The analog to this might be long-winded car chases that seem obligatory in the movies.

Besides that caveat the story lines are quite compelling. How they match the real history of that time I do not know.

The big draw back now is the last 3 episodes won't play. The footage keeps cutting out and has screen-freezing fits that don't go away.",1439596800,,403,4.493150684931507

5656782,4,B00BMRTPEM,I love to learn history as an adult.  This pre-Henry the VIII was very well done (not as good as the Tudors in costuming and set).  The series emphasizes women's role in history by portraying mothers as schemers yet politically clueless.  This  is a bitter pill to take and makes me want to study from a history book again.,1439596800,,323,4.423728813559322

5656790,5,B00BMRTPEM,I love this series! It's extraordinarily well-made and entertaining until the last minute. I can definitely see myself watching this over and over. I was thrilled to hear that they'll be continuing the story with the rest of Phillipa Gregory's novels from this series.,1439596800,,268,5.113636363636363

8570989,5,B00BMRTPEM,"This isn't factual by any means, but I went into this knowing that. That said, I have to say I really enjoy this series.  I'm not a fan of the main character, and by the end I was ready to switch sides and yell witch like George because I cannot for the life of me understand what Edward saw in her and surely witchcraft had to be involved. She's manipulative, power hungry, and was in fact the cause of her sons and brother getting murdered- and if you read the White Princess or watch the series you know Elizabeth Woodville doesn't get any better and never learns from her mistakes. I felt the same about Anne Neville and was shocked that I loved Anne's character in the books but couldn't stand her in the show. I've read the Red Queen about Margaret and have to say she by far is the best thing in this series. Her scenes were hysterical and I actually found myself rooting for her. I also enjoyed Richard III and felt this showed a different side of him that most never learned about.  If you want to learn about this time period, this isn't for you. If you already know about this time period and looking for a romanticized drama about it, then I'd recommend this.",1525132800,,1171,4.318181818181818

8570991,2,B00BMRTPEM,"I'm a fan of this time period, but not this show.  I really tried to like it.  Even made it to episode 9.  Historical accuracy doesn't bother me - I see that as a problem in many of the negative reviews.  The problem with this show is that I do not care about ANY of the characters, not even the children.  They could all be wiped out by the plague and it wouldn't matter to me.  The plot seems rushed.  It started off vaguely interesting, but not enough time was spent on character development for me.  You cannot always rely on plot and action to drive a series.  A viewer must care about the characters, especially this viewer.  I thought I could finish the first season, but it's just not worth it...even while having it play in the background while I work.  I don't understand all the positive reviews.",1524700800,,807,4.348993288590604
