8718801,5,B00YQTCOHI,"I discovered STORM FEAR one rainy Sunday afternoon in the 1960s. It was one of those Sunday Afternoon Movies that used to show on local TV on the stations that weren't carrying baseball games. These stations would drag out old movies from the 30s, 40s, and 50s, usually black-and-white b-movies, to fill up a couple of hours.

Something about the atmosphere of this film grabbed me and I never forgot the story. Actually, by the time home video became possible, I wondered if I could find this movie again and tape it, but by then the title had escaped me. With the help of movie books by Leonard Maltin and Roger Ebert, my memory was finally jogged as to its title, STORM FEAR.

The film by this time was so obscure that it was rarely, if ever, shown on TV. It was black-and-white in the age when everyone wanted everything in color so it never showed up in the TV listings - until sometime in 1990 or so, I spotted it as a LATE, LATE SHOW entry (back when they showed movies overnight). I taped it to VHS, watched it to be reunited with it, and was disappointed in the video quality of the tape I'd made. For some reason, the picture got darker and darker as the film moved on, making the ending scenes hard to view. But hey, at least I finally had a copy.

That tape languished on my shelves, but I kept it anyway, knowing of its relative rarity, and I never expected to see it show up in any kind of home video presentation - ever. Occasionally I'd look it up on the Internet and find only the barest information.

Sometime in 2010 or so, I dug out the tape and made myself a DVD-R of it for preservation, and the opportunity to edit out those late-night commercials that filled the VHS tape. The darkness at the end was still a problem, but I prided myself on knowing that I had this film on a DVD and could watch it anytime.

What a surprise it was to see the film listed in a coming-soon thread on the Internet in 2014. I literally counted the days up to release day and was thrilled when it came to my door. Amazon got it to me on release day and I reveled in watching it then and there. Finally the film was sharp and clear on Blu-ray, with crisp images, widescreen picture, and great sound. I could never have imagined that the day would come when I could see this old movie as it was meant to be seen.

The film stars (and was produced and directed by) Cornel Wilde. Also present is Dan Duryea, Jean Wallace, Kevin Stollery, Lee Grant, Dennis Weaver, and was the first film credit for Steven Hill. Living in the mountains are Duryea, Wallace, and their son played by Stollery. It's a solitary existence, far removed from civilization as Duryea is suffering from a respiratory ailment and is attempting to provide for his family by writing a book. Dennis Weaver is the handyman who has eyes for Wallace but is still devoted to the family. Weaver is almost a stand-in father figure for young Stollery as the film opens.

Complications arise when Duryea's brother, a bank-robber, arrives with his entourage of Grant and Hill, fleeing the authorities, and with a bullet in his leg. Meanwhile, a snowstorm is brewing...

Do yourself a favor and give this one a look. It's not the greatest film ever made, but it sure made an impression on me at the time. Maybe pick a rainy Sunday to give it a try...",1471996800,5,3306,4.372964169381108

Cornel Wilde wasn't my favorite actor, but the film ain't bad.

Storm Fear is 1955, Cape Fear is 1962.",1453420800,3,248,4.125
