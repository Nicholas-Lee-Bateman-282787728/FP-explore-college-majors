8556726,4,B00AQY1478,"This comedic spy spoof of everyones favorite heroine, Modesty Blaise probably caused fans to scream bloody murder. It was so idiotic, it didn't even rate as high as Dean Martins Matt Helm. However, as an idiotic romp, it was enjoyable, and I admit to a couple of laughs. It did make me go back and re-read the Modesty Blaise novels to wash the bad taste out of my mouth. Leave it to the film industry to offer an iconic character like Modesty as a silly spoof. That saying, I was still entertained by this goofy movie, and by removing the real characters and replacing them with cartoon characters, I accepted the movie as what it was, simply a spoof. For the Modesty Blaise fan, there is a better movie out there, My Name Is Modesty.",1365379200,,734,4.444444444444445
