217156,5,6300183769,"The TV series STREET HAWK is currently being rerun on the UK's BRAVO satellite channel, alongside other cheesy classics such as AIRWOLF and KNIGHT RIDER. The first episode is a gem. Jesse MAch(REX SMITH - whatever happened to HIM?) loses his police partner during a drugs bust. When FBI agent Normal Tuttle corners him, he jumps on this sleek looking Honda motorcycle armed with machine guns, laser cannons(come on!) and missiles, not to mention a rocket thruster and vertical lift capability, becoming the STREET HAWK vigilante by night, and a desk cop by day, to get his own revenge on the baddies. Hmmmm, you're thinking! Sounds awfully familiar! But watching this pilot episode now, and the series, really brought back some memories of the summer of 1984 for me. The musical soundtrack by Tangerine Dream simply rocks big time as well. If you can get hold of a copy of this, and you love 1980s action series with futuristic(for its time) technology, then don't miss this. Track it down and enjoy, the series still has a big fan base.",993254400,4,1037,4.798882681564246
217157,5,6300183769,"Jesse Mach is an ex-motorcycle cop injured in the line of duty. He has been recruited by a secret government operation to ride Streethawk, an all-terrain, attack motorcycle; capable of incredible speeds, and immense firepower. Only one man knows Jesse Mach's true indentity, special agent Norman Tuttle. It was great to see this again, but it was a little disconcerting that all of Streethawk's amazing devices were monitored with the help of the telephone company. I would have assumed the a secret government operation would have a more secure phone line.",982800000,5,557,5.131868131868132
217158,5,6300183769,"Yeah this is the series, folks- I have always been a fan of S/H, since  1985, and after 15 years (I've just got the entire series on video, along  with my original PAL and NTSC versions of the pilot), I can honestly say  that my allegiance to Michael Knight seems to be wavering... Okay, so the  guy's name is Jesse, but aside from that, this is the series that should  NEVER have been canned. If you've only seen the pal version of this vid,  (British and Canadian versions had different effects in the pilot to the US  version), you'll be over the moon with the US NTSC version. Cleaner  effects, notably the particle weapon beam, and the hyperthrust, and also  has the opening credits from the series, that the pal does not have. What  else can I say? COOL music by Tangerine Dream, reasonably undated action,  yep, buy it NOW If you don't, and it gets deleted, well you've only  yourself to blame! Love, Stu.

217159,5,6300183769,I have brought street hawk and I want to buy the rest of the collection. There was more than one series made.

217160,5,6300183769,"When you say the word ""1980's"" to me, two things come to mind. Duran Duran and Streethawk. Im not too sure what the appeal of this series was to me, but somehow im hooked. All you need to say to me is the word  Hyperthrust and my pulse will indeed race. If you liked Night Rider you'll  love this. I mean what can I say....Night Rider would drive at the bad  guys, Streethawk would blow the s**t out of them. No contest, quality  stuff. Buy this video!",952387200,4,452,4.160919540229885
217161,4,6300183769,"After Knight Rider was a success Street Hawk came along.  Basically the same type of story as Knight Rider, but with a suped up motorcycle. This movie is the 90 min. pilot of the ABC 1985 TV series, though this tape only  runs approx. 1 hour(so I'm not sure what was cut if anything).  The TV  series only ran for about 1 season and only had 13 episodes, thats  including the pilot, but was a lot fun.",921801600,6,401,4.1558441558441555

7804171,1,6300183769,"Los Angeles 2019 AD. The world was ravaged by nuclear holocaust and the surviving humans are fighting a desperate war against the crime scum.

A Street Hawk motorcycle that would go 280 mph in traffic while firing small rockets, with a total video uplink to the master crime lab in Jesse Mach's, a desk bound cop, helmet, and a racing suit form-fitted to his body by immersing him in a vat of high-tech foam. Silly.

There wasn't an interesting story during the entire run, just lots of flash; TV will never learn that if the story is good everything else will fall into place. Each episode was the same. Lots of boring people fighting, the motorcycle moving somewhere, lots of boring people fighting.

This sounds like ""Knight Rider"" on a motorcycle, and it was. But at least most of the episodes on ""Knight Rider"" had a plot.",1384819200,,827,4.612244897959184
7804172,3,6300183769,"STREET HAWK was a show about a supercycle with capabilities beyond imagination designed to combat urban crime on the streets of L.A. riden by an ex-motorcycle cop Jesse Mach(Rex Smith)who works as a public affairs officer for the fictional Metropolitan P.D. in the daytime and works as the anonymous crime-fighting STREET HAWK at nighttime with the control of Dept. of Justice Agent Norman Tuttle(Joe Regabulto)who controls the Street Hawk supercycle at their secret hideout command center.

STREET HAWK also takes me all the way back to memory lane to when it was the bomb on Friday nights when it made its debut on Friday January 4, 1985 before it tanked in March of 1985 which was perhaps due to the fact that STREET HAWK was too closely related to both KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF and had premiered too soon after them too since STREET HAWK had premiered on ABC in the Winter of 1985, AIRWOLF had premiered on CBS in the Winter of 1984, and KNIGHT RIDER had premiered on NBC in the Fall of 1982.

Therefore, the premiere of STREET HAWK started giving viewers too much of the same thing every weekend since ABC had STREET HAWK on Fridays, CBS had AIRWOLF on Saturdays, and NBC had KNIGHT RIDER on Sundays which gave viewers too much competition and redundancy, despite the fact that STREET HAWK had stolen KNIGHT RIDER's thunder as well as ""The Man, The Machine"" motto away from Michael Knight(David Hasselhoff)and KITT since KNIGHT RIDER was the bomb on television until STREET HAWK came along, despite the fact that the creation of STREET HAWK was inspired by both KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF.

Therefore, there wouldn't have been any STREET HAWK if there hadn't already been KNIGHT RIDER since KNIGHT RIDER was the show that started the phenomenon in high tech vehicles and had outlasted both STREET HAWK & AIRWOLF, especially since STREET HAWK didn't even last since the show flopped after only 2 months, but then ABC had brought STREET HAWK back on the air temporarily in May of 1985 to finish off its remaining 3 episodes just like CBS had temporarily brought THE INCREDIBLE HULK back on the air in the Spring of 1982 to finish off its last 2 final episodes after the Hulk was cancelled unexpectedly in the mid Fall of 1981, due to budget cuts and a change in management at CBS.

Even though STREET HAWK was a very popular TV show just like AIRWOLF & KNIGHT RIDER were, STREET HAWK seemed to have strong enough ratings, the show suddenly hit a speed bump after only 10 weeks since STREET HAWK apparently didn't get the ratings ABC wanted & was abruptly cancelled in the Spring of 1985 with no 2nd Season underway.

STREET HAWK was originally scheduled to premiere in the Fall of 1984 on Mondays on 8PM, but then ABC changed their minds and ended up pushing it back to midseason by having it debut in the Winter of 1985 on Fridays at 9PM instead.

Something else that intrigues me is even though STREET HAWK was in competition with KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF and was created by totally different producers and was on a rival network from both AIRWOLF & KNIGHT RIDER, as luck would have it KNIGHT RIDER, AIRWOLF, and STREET HAWK were all distributed by Univeral pictures and were all filmed at Universal Studios Hollywood in Universal City, California.

I just wish Universal would re-release STREET HAWK on DVD and provide this short-lived series with closed captioning mode like Universal has already done with all 4 seasons of KNIGHT RIDER and the first 3 seasons of AIRWOLF.",1340668800,2,3471,4.7084019769357495

7804176,4,6300183769,"An excellent series for its time in the 1980's. A few special effects look slightly dated today, but mostly it's aged well and is still very enjoyable and nostalgic. The superb music (by Tangerine Dream) is particularly memorable. Contrary to what others may have said, the series has never been released on DVD anywhere. Any DVDs advertised are unofficial, recorded from TV and will be transfers from VHS tape to DVD (not good quality), as the series has not been on TV for some years (since 2001). Despite a strong fanbase, an official DVD release does not seem likely in the near future. Only the pilot episode has ever been officially released on VHS.
