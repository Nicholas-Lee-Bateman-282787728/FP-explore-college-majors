7798717,4,1574927728,"the reason the picture quality isn't stellar is because these are indie (independent) films.  that means that for the most part they aren't big budget movies with multi-billion dollar studios backing the films.  in the same token, you aren't going to get the tired and predictable Hollywood actors and screenplays.  it's a fair trade-off in my opinion...watch movies that were made to quench the artistic desire, not the pocketbook.
more specifically, ""Breaking the Waves"" is a truly excellent film.  Watson gives a heart-wrenching performance, and the storyline is top-notch.  i haven't viewed the other two films yet.",971222400,3,619,5.34020618556701
7798718,2,1574927728,I was suprised to find the films of these disks not presented in widescreen.  The overall picture quality seems very poor.,957139200,7,122,4.809523809523809
7798719,2,1574927728,I was suprised and disappointed to find these films squashed into the square TV format (instead of widescreen). The picture quality is also poor.  I've learned a valuable lesson: just because its on DVD doesn't mean its  good.,957139200,3,226,4.921052631578948
7798720,3,1574927728,"These are great films, and they deserve better treatment.""Traveller"" and ""Matewan"" are NOT widescreen presentations and ""Breaking the Waves"" is not 1.85:1,as listed on  the case, but is 2.35:1. Nit-picking? I think not, as I believe that even  though these are budget-priced discs,  films should be presented widescreen  if that was the theatrical presentation, and ""Traveller"" could  have done with a 5.1 sound mix given that there are no extras. I guess i  would rather pay more for premium treatment of great movies, than pay less  and have to settle with just  being thankful that the movies are on disc at  all. A missed opportunity from ARTISAN, especially since the potential  buyers for movies such as these three would happily pay extra for top-notch  releases.",952041600,12,770,5.08
7798721,5,1574927728,BREAKING THE WAVES is a wonderful film from Lars von Trier and perfect acting from Emily Watson. Also Traveller is a good and different movie and has cool soundtrack. Matewan has some technical problems on DVD but slow  pacing film. In general a must have collector's pack.,951004800,2,273,4.808510638297872
