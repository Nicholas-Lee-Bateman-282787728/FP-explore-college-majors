8374423,4,B002MZZTQG,"Naschy is interesting as the title character, but be warned that the film is something of a gore fest -- and includes a scene to make PETA scream (flaming rats).  If you're a Naschy fan, you'll probably dig it.  I did.  Not up to the best of his Hombre Lobo (werewolf) films, but some good horror movie stuff, and a little bit of sex, too.

The Sinister Cinema print is a good high-end tape-quality print, but tends to be too dark in the night scenes, making it hard to follow.  And though it says in the description that the transfer is from a 16mm print -- and perhaps it was at some point -- there was an obvious tape/scan-line artifact on the DVD at one point.  So, if it came from 16mm, it must have gone to tape as an intermediate step before DVD.  There were a few jumps, too; hard to tell how much was missing.  Could be just a few seconds, but...  I'd give 3 stars for the SC print; not perfect, but better than nothing.  I'd like to see a clean, uncut digital transfer of this film.",1346544000,5,992,4.173684210526316
8374424,5,B002MZZTQG,"I am a TRUE fan of the late Paul Naschy.  I have just about ALL of his movies and feel that he performed a true art in horror movies that is LOST in today's horror films,and probably never existed in American horror films (maybe with the exception of the original ""Night of the Living Dead"" and a few others, yea ""The Shining"" Stephen King's movie).

This movie (Hunchback of the Morgue) helped complete (well almost) my collection of Paul Naschy films.  It was a very good plot.  The only problem is that the movie is very ""dark"" in some scenes, which probably means it was patched together from old film rolls or something.  However, when I view a Paul Naschy film, I get a bit of European/Spanish history, as he shot all his movies in real castles, real villas, etc.  You get the feel that you're watching a scene from 1650, or whatever time period the movie reflects in its storytelling.  He knew how to give you ""a feel"" of the atmosphere (squeamish, scary, cold chills, etc.) for what the story reflects, and Hunchback of the Morgue certainly fulfilled this requirement.  In short, despite some of the dark shots in certain segments, I loved this movie, as with all of Naschy's movies.  I was spooked, scared, goosebumps, and all watching it.

This is vintage Naschy at one of his best.  Rest in peace Naschy -- you gave the world good movies that we're hard pressed to see much of today!  You made a true contribution to world cinema.",1298851200,12,1441,4.542635658914729
