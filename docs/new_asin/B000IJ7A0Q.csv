2658260,4,B000IJ7A0Q,"Of the two new Debbie Rocker walking workouts (this one and AM/PM Walk), this is definitely the better one!  Clocking in at just under an hour, this workout offers more variety than AM/PM, utilizing squats, knee lifts, etc.  While some people find Leslie Sansone's (Walk Away The Pounds) chattering to be annoying, I like that she seems to be genuinely interested in the other exercisers with her.  Debbie patronizingly drones on about the benefits of good health, etc.  If I were going to do this routine over and over, it would get REALLY annoying.  On a positive note, while the music wasn't as ""pumping"" as I would have liked, it was at least soothing and in keeping with the absolutely beautiful outdoor setting.",1168819200,18,717,4.796747967479675

Uses high interval training.",1409184000,,57,4.8
2658284,5,B000IJ7A0Q,"Recently I tried Debbie's am/pm walk, and loved it! Today I tried this workout and I think it's excellent, with just the right amount of low and high intensity for me. I know there are more intense workouts, but this one is just right, since I have EA and I have to exercise, but can't do a lot of strenous moves. So, thank you Debbie, and thank you Amazon for the prompt response; the product arrived earlier than expected.",1407974400,3,424,4.379746835443038
2658285,5,B000IJ7A0Q,I HAVE ALL OF DEBBIE ROCKER'S EXERCISE DVDS.  SHE IS A GREAT INSTRUCTOR AND VERY EASY TO FOLLOW.,1406419200,,96,4.333333333333333
2658286,1,B000IJ7A0Q,I thought I was getting a walk CD and even the great scenery did not mask the fact that she should have called this a lunge/squat DVD with occasional walking. Did this once and will never do it again.,1399939200,,200,4.153846153846154
2658287,4,B000IJ7A0Q,I normally us Leslie Sansone exercise DVD's. I like Debbie for an added boost & change. I use the 30 min. It is a good 30 mins!,1397347200,,127,3.740740740740741
2658288,1,B000IJ7A0Q,"This was so boring, no speed up, no real other moves (Leslie Sansone mixes it up so it isn't boring and so does the flat belly walking dvd).  The scenery was nice, I'd recommend it to an much older person.",1388361600,,205,4.125
2658289,5,B000IJ7A0Q,"I really like Debbie Rocker.  I am experiencing a back injury and have needed to fnd a ""easier"" workout that would still be challenging.  I find that this dvd fits the bill.",1382313600,,173,4.375
2658290,5,B000IJ7A0Q,"Again, all her work-outs make you tune into what you are doing so I find myself not skimping on any of the moves.  They are so simple but really get you where you need to be.
I wish there were more DVD's  to get with Debbie Rocker.  She is fantastic!!",1360972800,,251,3.98
2658301,4,B000IJ7A0Q,I recommend this for anyone who wants a good cardio workout that has intervals and lower body strength moves.  I am not able to do other workouts that work the upper body a lot. I have gotten in very good shape just doing the 3o minute workout (a recent study posted in _Precision Nutrition_ says that a moderate workout is sufficient); sometimes I do some or all of the 5o minute routine. One thing I do (since I have a fitness background and know proper form) is play my own music while doing the workout (just mute or turn down the volume a bit) so that I have more energetic music to motivate me. All in all I  recommend this video for the reasons stated and I can take it as easy as I want or challenge yourself.  P.S. I first borrowed this from the library and tried it and recommend that for any video workout.,1350000000,,817,4.2243589743589745
2658302,2,B000IJ7A0Q,"I lasted nine minutes before I shut it off and put on a different DVD. There's not much I can add to what everyone else has said in criticism of this DVD. If it were just boring and repetitive, I would still keep it and occasionally do it. But Ms. Rocker's CONSTANT never-shutting-up coupled with her uncomfortable cranky arrogance were too much for me. I was begging her to shut up at four minutes and couldn't take it any more at nine.",1346284800,,437,4.341463414634147
2658303,5,B000IJ7A0Q,"I love exercising with this DVD. I feel like I get a great workout with this and it is not hard to do.  I do have some problems with my knees, but I find the more I do these exercises the better my knees feel.",1338854400,,209,3.6444444444444444
2658304,4,B000IJ7A0Q,"I have used Leslie Sansone walk at home products for several years. I wanted something to switch things up and tried this video. It kicked my butt! Not that I wasn't able to do it, but it got me sweating, and I was a little sore this morning. It is a great video to use for variety as it uses different moves than Leslie.

I liked the outdoor scenery and Debbies chatter wasn't terribly annoying. (They all are annoying but this is better than some.) I could have cared less about the other walkers except they had more realistic body types and weren't as intimidating as Debbie and the male body builder. If someone was to look at Debbie she doesn't need to lose a pound, which could be depressing if you are getting this for weight loss.

This is NOT a beginner video. I am training to walk my first 5K and am doing intervals with 2 minute jogs, and this video was a great workout for me. The modifications would be essential for a beginner. The squats and lunges are not for someone without some coordination, but it's not dance steps. There were some steps I did not feel quite graceful enough to pull off.

I haven't listened to the audio cd, so I can't comment.",1334534400,2,1167,4.344036697247707
2658305,4,B000IJ7A0Q,"I've walked hundred of miles, mostly just doing my own thing, but in the last year almost exclusively with Leslie Sansome DVDs.  I like Leslie's works, but quite frankly I am becoming quite bored, even with ""newer"" DVDs, they are Too Much the same.  I got Debbie Rocker's ""Walking for Weight Loss"" a couple of days ago and did the Full-Length Workout a few minutes ago.  I liked it quite a bit.  At times I did feel like I was on a walk with her.  I liked her muscle work (something I feel is missing for Sansone's) and Debbie does add some Higher Impact - which I don't do, I modify. And I was delighted there were New Moves to do - but do realize her Base of operation is WALKING/MARCHING, which is fine with me.

Negative points:  No Mile Markers, NO MPH Guage, NO way to Judge how fast or far I've gone.  I keep Track of my miles and speed, just like a dieter keeps track of their calories.  It works for me.

I give it 4 stars from an advance Walker viewpoint.  In NO way am I a runner, high impact person, or weight lifter. Power Walking is what I do.",1327190400,3,1057,4.132352941176471
2658306,5,B000IJ7A0Q,Finally - a workout that really changes you- or rather - a workout that finally made changes in me- not just weight loss- strengthening!  I can jog now for short blasts - which is so empowering I keep returning to this workout.  Thank you Debbie Rocker! I alternate the Rocker DVDs with Leslie Sansone's WalkAtHome dvds.  start the day with a little sweat!,1320364800,,356,4.619047619047619
2658307,5,B000IJ7A0Q,"I rented this dvd from the library and am now buying it!  It does have great scenery and I also like how as the previous review mentioned that the she varies the heart rate from speeding up to slowing down.  I have heard this does help to burn additional calories.  Also I do like how Debbie coaches you throughout the video, I feel it helps to maintain mental focus on the fact that you are working out and it adds much needed stimulation to a workout dvd.  She also varies the activities to not only just walking but other toning exercises that I love, I would recommend this dvd it is great!",1316563200,,594,4.276785714285714
2658308,5,B000IJ7A0Q,"I""m 50.  I tried the 30 minute version first and have been doing the 50 minute workout ever since.  My knees hurt from over use and I found I needed to vary my exercise with biking, and street walking so as not to do this video every day.  I can handle every other day.  It's  really effective for me.  I feel like I'm losing weight and making shaping progress after doing this one.  Glad I found it.",1306195200,,400,4.116883116883117
2658309,4,B000IJ7A0Q,"This workout is easily paced and I was able to catch on right away to the moves.  These walking DVDS are great for senior citizens like myself who like to exercise but do need the simpler workouts.  The only criticism I have is that about midway through the workout, this DVD shows several minutes of just scenery, and I thought this detracted from the pace of the workout.  Otherwise, I really liked this DVD.",1296172800,,410,4.513513513513513
2658310,5,B000IJ7A0Q,"I like walking workouts because I don't like high impact routines that have a lot of jumping around or extensive choreography.  I have quite a few Leslie Sansone workouts but this is a nice walking based workout that is more intense than most of Leslie's routines.  Debbie Rocker stresses that she is a professional athlete and uses moves that athletes use to keep in shape.  This workout is 50 minutes and has a combination of cardio sections and body shaping sections.  There is also an alternative 30 minute version.  It is shot in a garden with a mountain backdrop and includes one cardio section that has just fast walking while a variety of nature scenes play in the background.  Debbie uses basic walking moves but changes things up by adding intensity with side steps, skater moves, light jogging, and including arm movements.  I felt like I got a solid workout in 50 minutes.",1285372800,4,884,4.738562091503268
2658321,5,B000IJ7A0Q,"I have a rather extensive library of fitness dvds so that I can mix up my routine so I've also done several walking dvds to which I can compare this one...and it's a good one in my opinion.

CALORIE BURN: First I'd like to touch on the caloric burn of the dvd since that is, afterall, typically the goal of the purchase. I wear a bodybugg to measure not only my daily caloric burn but also to allow me to see exactly how many calories I burn during a workout and how many calories I burn per minute during said workout.  I mention this only so that you know what I say is based upon scientific measurement rather than simply perceived exertion. I was surprised...I didn't feel worn out or wiped out and yet this rated quite high on calorie burn, especially for a walking dvd!  The instructor takes into account, it seems, current studies saying that you actually get a higher calorie burn by taking your heart rate on a roller coaster ride rather than keeping it at the same high level or low level the whole time...I've read it compared to a car that uses more gas if you speed up, slow down, go steady, speed up, slow down etc rather than going all fast or all slow...you also burn more calories, (like a car burning more gas) oddly, with the variety of heart rate and continue to burn them longer after the workout.  She actually mentions the variation during the workout so it seems it is based upon this and it worked.

SCENERY: If you do the longer workout one of the coolest things they do in one part of it is you hear the trainer but they put in scenery as though you are walking through the Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, A forest, walking on the beach, etc. I loved this! It was a cross between clearing your mind in meditation and being on the most beautiful walk possible while being in my air conditioned home!  It also added great interest to a fitness dvd that also offered good workout moves in the other parts of the dvd...In the other scenes the instructor and back up coaches are on a beautiful California hillside.  So if you have to be indoors to workout, it's an unusual escape in my opinion. Clever.

INSTRUCTOR: Positive, upbeat, full of energy.

INTEREST: I'll be the first to admit the reason I own so many workout dvds is that I have complete workout ADD and boredom. On many workouts I just stop half way and hop on an elliptical we have or start dancing. I bore easily. This one was one of the rare ones that kept my interest from start to finish. I've done both the long version and the 30 minute workout many times and I personally loved them both and stayed with it, happily, without staring at the clock. Ever. For me this is a rare oddity.

WORKOUT: You'll be doing variations on walking and leg moves but with some strength and toning added simply by the variation of leg movements and arm movements. She gets your heart rate up by doing a combo of arm movements with leg movements and it works well.

LEVEL: I'm pretty advanced but a beginner could do this one because she has an alternate back up coach that will do beginner moves you can follow instead. I think anyone would get results from it.

MUSIC: The music is made specifically to go in tempo with your movements and is good and upbeat rather than the odd electronica you sometimes get during some fitness dvds.

INCLUDED: A long workout, a 30 minute quick workout, and also an audio cd are included so that when you want to walk on the street or hike or whatever away from your dvd player and without the additional moves you get with the dvd player you have a coach and music guiding you that also sets the beat for optimum results.

BACK UP TEAM: I think they put a great deal of thought into including someone everyone can identify with in their back up team. All kinds of people, all shapes, and even a man to follow along with. Although I personally can be motivated by all size 2 perfect people on a team as long as they do the moves right, many would rather follow along to someone they can identify with (and I am not a size 2!)so this allows well for that if so.

NEGATIVES: The only thing that I thought was silly was the instructor talking about it being a ""high intensity workout"".  It does burn calories well but not ""high intensity"" well  like full out hard core aerobics so this seemed inaccurate to relay on the 30 minute workout. The greatest part was I didn't feel wiped out but did well, according to my bodybugg, in burning calories...but I would never call this a high intensity workout.

ALTERNATIVES: Although I'm not crazy about all of Kathy Smith's dvds, she offers really good walking dvds too with fun moves and also good caloric burn. Sometimes she splices in dance steps.  So some of hers would be a good alternative or addition in a walking dvd.

CONCLUSION: This ranked high on my list of fitness dvds...I felt it among the most enjoyable to do, it was rare in that it spliced in gorgeous scenery to make you feel you are in paradise when you are stuck inside working out, the calorie burn was very good but the exertion didn't feel tough, the energy and music were good...all the things to make me keep going back and hitting ""play"" on this one again and again.",1259020800,49,5188,4.3899895724713245
2658322,5,B000IJ7A0Q,"I enjoy both the dvd and the cd.  Debbie has amazing enthusiasm and drive, and as she says, it's about weight loss and so much more.",1256256000,,132,4.076923076923077
2658323,4,B000IJ7A0Q,I like this video alot.  it's not so strenuous that i quit after one time. easy to follow. easy  to do,1246752000,,102,3.8095238095238093
2658324,4,B000IJ7A0Q,"Yes you ""jog""  Yes you do squats and lunges  Yes this is more than walking.

It is a nice lower body workout with some calorie burn. The pace is good, starting off low then building up. The recovery time is sufficient Debbie's calls are clean, and demonstrated well. I would suggest this DVD as a good add to a workout library, but would not suggest it to anyone looking to just walk.",1242345600,,384,4.305555555555555
2658325,3,B000IJ7A0Q,"I have been using Sansone videos to lose weight (30+ pounds so far). However, I am still 40 pounds overweight and I have weak knees. This is why I only considered buying another walking video when seeking to add more variety to my workouts.

I wasn't prepared for a ""walking"" video that throws in lunges (front, side and back), jogging in place (Debbie calls it shuffling and kicking your heels up) and squats (not easy on the knees).

Good: There is a girl to follow for alternate (easier) steps during the jogging and squats and it helped keep my knee burn to a minimum.

Good: My legs FEEL it in a way Leslie's DVD's never made them feel it before. The lunging and squatting are definitely strengthening and toning moves.

Disappointing: I sweat less in the full workout on this DVD, than I do on Leslie's shorter workouts. Could be the significantly lower amount of arm work. It wasn't till I added my own I started to feel a real cardio challenge on this one.

Are others correct in calling it ""boring""? Yes. With so VERY little arm/upper body work, the entire video does seem to be mostly marching, with some lunges, squats and jogging in between.

Least favorite part: When the camera goes off for several minutes showing just pretty scenics as you march in place with canned voice overs to encourage you. I began creating shopping lists in my head. Mentally disassociating from the workout.

Cool down was also disappointing. Heck, even Sweating to the Oldies has a better cool down.

Will I do it again? Yes. Once a week for the toning and strengthening. But, I will continue adding my own upper body workouts to the routine and do my own cool down and stretches.",1230940800,3,1672,4.587248322147651
2658326,5,B000IJ7A0Q,"I bought this DVD and Debbie Rocker's A.M. and P.M. Walking DVD in January 2007.  By December 2007 I had lost 48 lbs.  How did I do it?  By using them 7 days a week.  Also, I started eating a balanced diet and drank 8 cups of water a day.  It was a lot easier than I expected because her moves are pretty basic and gentle, but very effective because she trains you in intervals, modifying your heart rate.  She speaks in a conversational style, which made it un-annoying to see the same routines again and again.  From a practical perspective, I live in a three-story apartment, so I have to worry if all that jogging in place will disturb the neighbors below, and I have never had a complaint.  This is because Debbie has another walker do lower-impact modifications during the more rigorous sections.  I live in Alaska where there's snow 9 months out of the year, making it very difficult to walk outside, so I don't use the audio CD that comes with the DVD.  Because of the cold and snowy weather, this DVD is a great alternative to going to the gym every day.  If you're looking for greater variety, try the 50-minute full workout on this DVD.  If you use that, plus the 30-minute version, plus use the A.M. and P.M. Walking DVD, that's four complete workouts, so you never get bored.  Honestly, these two DVDs changed my life and I will be eternally grateful.  I have more self-confidence now about my appearance and sleep a lot more deeply because I went from being sedentary to being physically fit.  People who hadn't seen me in a year were shocked at how much weight I'd lost.  I recommend these two DVDs because they are effective, the music is not annoying, the settings are beautiful, outdoor vistas, and Debbie is truly the ""coach"" she describes herself to be.  That's about as ringing endorsement as I can muster.  Five stars.",1221782400,27,1840,4.507552870090635

2658328,3,B000IJ7A0Q,"The workout is great.  Love the form tips and the flow of the training.  But, PLEASE, give us an alternate side of your CD with about 80% less talking.  We can't concentrate on the music beat because there is just too much chatter.",1214870400,,231,4.325581395348837
2658329,4,B000IJ7A0Q,"This was my first experience with instructor Debbie Rocker.  Here Debbie leads the workout in a beautiful outdoor mountain setting with 4 background exercisers (one of whom shows modifications).  She does quite a bit of marching throughout the workout, but she adds some more intense moves which help to raise the heart rate further.

The warm-up lasts about 4 minutes and consists entirely on marching.  Debbie focuses on gradually encouraging you to pick up the pace, constantly talking to you like a coach or personal trainer.  Following the warm-up, the cardio work is broken down into segments.  The first is about 6 minutes and adds shuffles (light side-to-side jogs) and side steps to the basic march.  The second segment (8 minutes) weaves in some more toning-focused moves such as squats and lunges.  The 9-minute section that follows is mostly a basic walk while the scene shifts; although the scenery was beautiful, I found it harder to keep up my heart rate during this segment.  However, it does end with some easy jogs.  The next cardio segment was probably the toughest, as the intensity goes up with more toning work such as squats/lunges as well as more intense cardio moves such as skiers.  The final 11-minute segment alternates walking with intense jog segments and ends with a ""sprint to the finish.""  An approximately 3-minute cool-down/final stretch concludes the workout, bringing the total time in right around 50 minutes.

This DVD includes a shorter, 30-minute (actually 32 minute) workout that consists of the warm-up; cardio segments 1, 2, and 5; and the cool-down/stretch.  Also included is a bonus CD that is supposed to be for outdoor walking.  I didn't find the CD very motivating, however--it is simply Debbie talking, occasionally encouraging you to pick up the pace as the tempo changes, but that's it.  Debbie is fairly chatty in the main workout as well, which some might find annoying; also, she does not mirror-cue.  Furthermore, she does A LOT of marching, so if you're looking for more varied moves, this might not be the right workout for you.  The main reason I liked this workout is because I found it to be more intense than some of the other walking workouts I have tried, so I will be keeping it and would recommend it for that reason.",1204156800,27,2283,4.885714285714286
2658330,5,B000IJ7A0Q,"This is a great progressive workout - she does walk your butt off, but in my mind, that's what you're doing it for.  She gets your heart rate up, she makes you sweat, and if you put all of yourself into it you'll get a great workout, but that's really how all of them are.  Frankly, I find this workout to be more challenging than most of the Sansone workouts and on an equal par with Sansone's 5-mile challenge.  Debbie's no-nonsense un-chatty direction is great and there's some great videography to accompany the workout - unlike other workouts where the camera doesn't leave the instructor's face.

I love the outdoor scenery on this workout, and the walkers are pleasant, but I just didn't like the workout (the choreography felt robotic to me) or Debbie Rocker's coaching.  The workout didn't feel challenging or energizing.  Debbie says in a monotone voice that you can be more efficient and get good results with less effort, but I really like pumping it out to Leslie Sansone.  Debbie's chatter bugs me way more than Leslie Sansone's.  I didn't feel she was sincere at all.  Like the other reviewer, Debbie's ""I am your coach and life is an athletic event"" turned me off.  I feel that Leslie Sansone cares more about a person enjoying all of life more and that exercise can benefit anyone - today.  If you are looking for variety, I suggest Madeleine Lewis ""Cardio Burn"" also known as ""Get Moving: Walk for weight loss.""  The audio CD of this set would only benefit those who like her verbal coaching.",1182470400,5,1058,4.579787234042553

If they had designed this video like the New York Ballet video I would have been very happy (In the NY City Ballet Video you can turn off the talking after you've mastered the exercises, while keeping the music). All in all I gave this a 2 star rating because it may be better than nothing (although I have wondered). If you want to enjoy your walking stick to the outdoors!",1182384000,3,596,4.191304347826087

Debbie does the workout so that I (as a complete clutz and I HATE exercise because I feel stupid that I'm not coordinated)feel like I can do it again.  I like her telling me about coaching because I need it.  If you need encouragement for getting started this is a great place to start.  There is also a 50 min. CD you can use for outdoors.

I don't need cute or chatty or some aerobic glam girl.  This is a great place to start.  I can't see myself doing only this video, but give it a go.  It's definately motivated me for 5 days solid.",1173484800,4,702,4.095588235294118
2658349,5,B000IJ7A0Q,"I like this workout because it is tougher than most walking workouts.  The only drawback on this one is listening to Debbie talking about ""her being the coach, and we are her athletes"".  That part got a little old, but the workout is solid.  Low impact with lots of sweat.",1172880000,11,272,4.4
2658350,5,B000IJ7A0Q,"I bought this because I got really tired of Leslie Sansone's ""chatty kathy"" ways.  This routine is a step up, a bit more varied than the average walking tape, and a little more challening.",1172102400,15,188,4.529411764705882
8145847,2,B000IJ7A0Q,"Boring, boring, boring. The first four minutes are just walking and waiting for her to stop talking and get on with the workout. No new moves and very little variety. I also do not like having a full CD of music and talk. What is that about? If I wanted a motivational CD, I would have bought one. I wanted an exercise tape and this one does not compare to the Leslie Sansone tapes I usually do. Yes, the scenery is pretty but that is the only positive I have here.",1486598400,,465,4.1208791208791204
8145848,5,B000IJ7A0Q,"I have walked with Leslie Sansone's workouts for years & years & years.  I alternate between her walking workouts and others' such as Jari Love,  Jillian Michaels, Jackie Warner, etc. on the in-between days.  I love Leslie, but I felt there could be something better out there... I think I just found it!  I really LOVE this workout!  The thing missing from Leslie's workouts is the interval training.  Leslie simply takes you faster & faster.  This workout takes you faster, then slower, then back to faster.  I am loving this workout!  The scenery is so breathtakingly beautiful!  It's just a bonus to the real ""beauty"" of this weight-loss workout!  I hope to keep this in rotation for many years!",1468800000,3,699,4.7899159663865545
8145849,5,B000IJ7A0Q,"Two for the price of one here.  I don't use the 30-minute program much as it is just an abbreviated version of the longer one, and for a short tough workout I like Debbie's Quick Start Walking for Weight Loss better.  The 50-minute program, however, is very effective.  When it gets a bit much I entertain myself watching for her crew to miss a cue; this makes me feel better when I do it.  Frankly I don't always pay attention to the cues.  I mean, this is not a high school precision marching band, is it?  And if I feel like making some other moves once in a while, Debbie will never know.  The point is she gets me moving and she's got me doing things I couldn't do before, as well as losing weight and shaping up.  I don't miss a day with Debbie Rocker.",1461110400,4,758,4.1438356164383565

8145852,5,B000IJ7A0Q,"I am not an ""in shape"" person, but I do the best I can on the 30 min workout portion of this video. I have several exercise CDs; this one I go back to frequently. It is, as it says, walking, no floor exercise. She does get your heart rate up and you do get a very good workout with basic moves. I may not always do the exact movement or do the movement for as long as the video says but if I alter anything I always go back to marching in place, which is what Debbie says to do. If you are contemplating purchasing an exercise video, please consider this one, I am almost 65, overweight and not active but this video is helping me change two of the three:)",1430092800,7,656,3.977272727272727

8145856,1,B000IJ7A0Q,"I read reviews and loved what i was hearing.. the idea of seeing beautiful scenery, a walk along the ocean with a motivational trainer --um YES, PLEASE!  I was so excited to use it!  If you think Leslie Sansone talks too much, then do NOT buy this video.  The lady is sweet and all, but she talks. non. stop!.. its just repetitive filler talk con-stant-ly.  It goes pretty much like  ""great job!  that's BEAUTIFUL. stay with me. Great job.  BEAUTIFUL job. you're doing great. stay with me. BEAUTIFUL!"" on repeat.  (Her favorite word is CLEARLY ""beautiful"")  EVEN when they cut to the ocean scene and your suppose to be able to take in the meditative scenery of the video eye candy, you are completely distracted by her voice-over constantly telling you to what? thats right! ""stay with me. beautiful!""  Look lady, i can walk to a beat--i got this! Plus, there's so many squats and lunges.. i HATE squats and lunges.  how about we WALK in our walking video, eh?  BEAUTIFUL!",1415664000,5,972,4.619883040935672
