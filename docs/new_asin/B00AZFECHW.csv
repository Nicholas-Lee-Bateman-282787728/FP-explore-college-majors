5529177,5,B00AZFECHW,Globe theater productions are as close as you can get to being in the Elizabethan era. Transport yourself back to the 1600s you're in for a treat.,1383350400,6,146,4.444444444444445
5529178,4,B00AZFECHW,Finally. A production without the low budget fluff of the Richard Burton/Elizabeth Taylor version. I can use this in class without fear of laughter from the students.,1381795200,3,166,5.185185185185185
5529179,4,B00AZFECHW,"I'm not sure what I was expecting when I ordered this DVD, but it had a great quality. I just wished there was a subtitles option.",1381536000,,130,4.038461538461538
5529180,5,B00AZFECHW,"The first thing you need to know is that this production was performed using the ""B"" script, published in 1616, which is over 600 lines longer than the ""A"" script, published in 1604. That means this is a very large cast, with scenes spread throughout history. The magical aspect of the production is that all of this is done within the confines of the stage of the reconstructed Globe theater, the theater of Shakespeare.

Since the cast is so big, many actors play two or three roles, which is no problem, because so many roles are just on stage for a minute or so, like the seven vices. At the time of Christopher Marlowe's untimely death, he was probably more popular than Shakespeare, who had only a half dozen plays on the boards by that time. And Shakespeare was a great admirer of Marlowe. ""Doctor Faustus"" was probably the ""Ben-Hur"" or ""Cleopatra"" of the day. It's delightful to see how such a sprawling story can be told, with only pure stagecraft. Among Marlowe's plays, there are probably more notable quotes than from any other, rivaling several of Shakespeare's more quotable plays. The most famous is probably:

Was this the face that launched a thousand ships,
And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?
Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss:
Her lips sucks forth my soul, see where it flies!

The weight of the production lies primarily on the two lead characters, Faustus and Mephistopheles, Paul Hilton and Arthur Darvill. Neither have especially strong resumes, but a check on their work confirms my sense that Darvill is the more experienced and stronger of the two. I would also give a favorable mention to a number of the supporting cast, especially to the actor who plays Faust's servant, Wagner.

I would also recommend it for the clarity of the actors' speeches. So many Shakespearean speeches seem to be delivered at double time, so it is hard to understand them. This play appears to be done close to a normal conversational speed.",1375315200,22,1958,4.75
5529181,4,B00AZFECHW,Anything produced by the Globe Theater group is aces in my book.  This edition of Marlow's Faustus is up to their best standards.,1371772800,,129,4.608695652173913
5529182,5,B00AZFECHW,"I have never seen this play available at local theater.  Live theater is the best experience, but a play filmed is a close second.  This is the first Marlowe play that I watched.  As a fan of Shakespeare, I kept running into references to this play.",1368316800,,249,4.369565217391305
5529183,5,B00AZFECHW,"I was incredibly fortunate enough to visit the Globe and see this fantastic production of Doctor Faustus. Not only that. . .I was actually there while they were taping the show. I was a ""groundling"" for this production, and it was one of the greatest theatrical experiences of my life. It was an excellent summer evening beneath the stars, and this production made me forget that I was standing for 2.5 hours. Using incredible puppetry, costuming, magic, and humor, this production soars. At one moment it is hysterically funny, at another incredibly magical, at another incredibly moving, at another incredibly dark and ominious. It would be an excellent counterpoint for any Shakespeare teacher to show their students who his contemporaries were. What I loved about being a groundling was the amount of audience interaction. We got all kinds of things thrown upon us or asked of us. I have been waiting for a year and a half for this DVD to come out, and I was thrilled when I saw this on Amazon.",1360368000,44,998,4.77456647398844
5529184,5,B00AZFECHW,"I highly recommend this for anyone interested in this era of theatre!  The acting was excellent, and the story is even better when experienced the way it was meant to be (on stage) than when experienced simply by reading the play.  DVD arrived on time and in condition promised.  I will use this seller again.",1401667200,2,309,4.581818181818182
5529185,5,B00AZFECHW,"Best production of Christopher Marlowe's Dr. Faustus I have ever seen, In fact this one of the best plays that I have ever seen. I would highly recommend for students required to read this play for British Literature.",1397952000,7,217,4.7368421052631575
5529186,5,B00AZFECHW,This is the play that Inspired Shakespeare to write his own plays. An amazing play that is an  absolute must for any Human Being!,1396742400,,129,4.375
5529187,5,B00AZFECHW,This is a superb DVD of one of the most famous plays of the Tudor era. Deserves to be seen by far more viewers - this DVD comes the closest to actually being in the theater.,1395964800,2,173,3.8333333333333335
5529188,5,B00AZFECHW,"Great! All the way around, a very good production. ""Rude, robust, magical and violent, it is a provocatively entertaining production.""",1395619200,3,134,5.75

5529190,3,B00AZFECHW,"This is a video of a live performance staged in a reproduction of the globe theatre. It is Marlow's Faustus not the more famous version by Goethe. The lead actor yells too much and stumbles over some lines. The play is hard to get into but eventually I got swept in. There are two extant versions of this play a short text and a long text with more slapstick stuck in . This production seems to be picking and choosing between both versions. It seems odd to go for a scholarly presentation but not a scholarly version of the text.

As far as the play I much prefer Tamerlaine and the Jew of Malta by this author. Marlowe is really great at chalenging the status quo and making one wrestle with ideas. This play does not offer much opportunity for that. In this play Fausts also gets far too many chances to repent. That makes it boring and unrealistic.",1394409600,,852,4.3584905660377355
5529191,5,B00AZFECHW,"A great performance, truly riveting, and really brings the atmosphere of the Globe Theater and Elizabeth theater to life for students!",1385856000,,134,5.428571428571429
5529192,5,B00AZFECHW,"I wanted a more"" modern"" intrepretation of  Marlowe' play  Dr. Faustus.  The  play is
 presented in a lively and fast moving way.  The actors were good and
 the quality  of the DVD is good.  I have added the play  to my DVD

5529193,5,B00AZFECHW,"I have to admit that I am not always a fan of watching stage plays recorded on film, much preferring to see the movie like setting varying between real locations, although neither I think is a match for actually being there to watch a stage performance.

In the 1960s  Marlowe's  Doctor Faustus was made into a movie starring Richard Burton as Faustus, and Elizabeth Taylor makes a brief appearance as Helen of Troy.

While that movie had its good points, and its star power, I particularly loved the note of pathos in Mephistopheles voice, showing that this was a nuanced portrayal as opposed to a stock character.

What becomes apparent as you begin to watch The Globe's production of that classic by Christopher Marlowe is that this though this is a staged play it captures every nuance I think of what Marlowe intended, and perhaps a few he did not, and I mean that in a good way because it's all good.  In fact, if you ever wanted to see Faustus, I would highly recommend you get this version over any other.

I particularly liked the comedic scenes, where one of the lesser character was accidentally using the magic book to make incantations, and what happens.  Then there is the beautiful and elegant expression of Marlowe.  There is the atmosphere created by the actors, and the response of the crowd particularly gives the play added dimension over staged plays which are filmed without audience participation.

One also understands that the play is being performed in the medium in which it was originally written, so it would not be that difficult to go backwards in time and imagine what it would be like to be in an Elizabethan or Restoration period audience, probably loud sweaty and uncivilized, a raucous crowd that react to scenes where Faustus performs magic on the Pope.

When one thinks about this particular era, although one tends to think of the Shakespeare plays as emblems of excellence, there were many great writers in that era who did create great works but who have been largely overlooked, and none were greater than Marlowe whose lines echo within the Shakespeare canon.

""Mingled with coral and with orient pearl.""  Tamburlaine

""I'll have them fly to India for gold,
Ransack the ocean for orient pearl ""  Doctor Faustus

""Of Persian silks, of gold, and orient pearl.""  Jew of Malta

""This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.""  Antony and Cleopatra

""Was won't to swell like round and orient pearls, "" Midsummer Nights dream

""The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl, ""  Richard III

I highly recommend this, I think you will love it, and I hope this was helpful.",1384473600,16,2656,4.751091703056769
8559619,4,B00AZFECHW,"As others have written, this is an excellent production, well acted, and it is great to see the dynamics of the Globe Theatre.  My one problem with it (and I use it  in a college classroom) is that there are no subtitles.  The decision to use the B text means you listen to all the jokes and banter, and a lot of it is incomprehensible unless you have an open text in front of you, which you don't in a dark room.  Even the old BBC Shakespeare's have subtitles these days, and not including that feature was, I think, a mistake.",1525219200,,528,4.198019801980198

8559621,5,B00AZFECHW,"I showed this to my Theatre History class after we studied Doctor Faustus as an example of Jacobean theatre (yes, yes I know it's technically Elizabethan because the Jacobean era didn't begin until after Marlowe's death, but this is the first play that has specific Jacobean features such as the supernatural and darker themes.)

The Globe's production was pretty unique - they are firm in their commitment to keep things as Shakespeare's day might have staged it, i.e. no modern-day technology; so there are very interesting F/X using puppetry and other stage tricks (some of the staging choices are a little bizarre, but it adds to the show overall), as well as elaborate costumes and use of traditional trap doors.  Arthur Darvill's weary, cynical Mephistopheles is the standout here.  There is a bizarre song/dance at the end with found-object instruments, but it's in keeping with playwrights sometimes ending Elizabethan plays with a musical number (though that's usually reserved for comedies) and seems to fit into this odd world created by Marlowe and director Jules Maxwell.

This production also plays up the comedy (sometimes a little too much, to be honest), and the students really enjoyed seeing the play come alive rather than dull (to them) verse on the page.  The actors handle the lines with ease; my students forgot they were listening to verse.  I switch out the plays they study for this class every year, but I think I'll be keeping this one in, because the difference between reading it and seeing this production is so dramatic.  The DVD has good quality and we had no trouble seeing it clearly even on a projected screen in a classroom.",1482278400,4,1662,4.935483870967742
