7624069,5,B01B8OHPUY,"My boys love this show (and I'm pretty sure it taught my 4 year old his ABC's before he was 2) and since it's no longer on my local network (or Netflix) I have been scouring the internet for reasonably priced DVD's and this is definitely one of them!

7624071,5,B01B8OHPUY,"These Word World dvd's have sparked an amazing interest in words, spelling and reading.  My just turned 5 year old Grandson went from shaky knowledge of alphabet to ""building"" and reading 6-8 letter words!  Almost overnight he now spells out and reads words on signs, billboards, TV, anywhere he sees a word!  He is reading some of his favorite books to us!  He loves to ""build a word."" All the characters are adorable and built out of the letters that spell what they are. The animation is adorable and the stories captivating and relevant.  Great purchase for any child in the getting ready to read stage.  His pre K teachers noticed a huge, quick improvement and I am certain it will give him an advantage for Kindergarten.  I am so grateful we found these! Thank you Word World!",1495843200,,782,4.6231884057971016

7624074,5,B01B8OHPUY,"My son loves WordWorld. As a parent, I love that it holds his attention and has educational value. I love that most objects are actual words (though not all) and that they look like they should. The mountain range is the word Mountain yet looks like a mountain range, the cave is the word cave & looks like a cave, etc. These are tattoo worthy cool, very creative and well done. If only real life was as simple as spelling out a word to create it!",1488326400,,447,4.209302325581396

7624080,5,B01B8OHPUY,"Bought this for my nephew for Christmas, he's 4 years old and just started pre-K. I had let him borrow some of my son's old ones and thought this one was really neat because my nephew is huge into Trucks and Trains and thought this present would make mom happier than the little boy, but I was wrong, when he opened it he screamed, ""Look mom! It's word world!"" He knew what it was (and he's not a reader) and was just as excited as mom was. It's a great way to help children learn and be excited at the same time!",1484092800,2,513,4.03921568627451

7624090,5,B01B8OHPUY,"This is about our  3 year old great grandson's favorite of our newly discovered Word World series, not sure why we never heard of it until my husband found it on Netflix. The grandson has improved his speech and is so excited telling he can us new words he can spell and pronounce. He runs to his letters with magnet backs and gets them out to match the words he sees. We love the Pl PL PL Plane the best we laugh our heads off over the plane engine starting up.
He also dances with dog. Hilarious!! This whole series is so much fun.

7624092,5,B01B8OHPUY,"When my boys were younger they loved WordWorld and now my 4 year old enjoys the show. We do however never catch it on television anymore so it was nice to own a DVD with episodes for her to watch, especially when we are in the car driving here and there for sports for my boys. This DVD features eight episodes of the Emmy Award Winning show WordWorld. The show is adorable and with eight episodes there is quite a lot to choose from as far as what to watch. There is about 1.5 hours of WordWorld broken down into viewable episodes where you can watch one or two at a time.

Episodes include:

Duck's Family Vacation
Back on Track
Pl-Pl-Plane
The Race to Mystery Island
Wee Little Whale
Rocket to the Moon
Race to the Spaceship
Flying Ant
