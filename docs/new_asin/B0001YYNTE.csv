2043950,5,B0001YYNTE,"Somehow I'd missed this film when it first came out....well, maybe it was because I was a teen rebel at the time and not much into Disney films....but I recently saw it and was nicely surprised. Excellent acting and marvelous songs; really, considering the techno slop they package as movie songs these days, just so they can sell a soundtrack, these songs really sparkle. And it's not surprising that they would, when you consider that the brother team that wrote the music for ""Mary Poppins"" and ""Jungle Book"" also wrote the music for this. I especially enjoyed ""Ten Feet Off The Ground""....a celebration of music itself. Sad that there isn't a CD of the soundtrack available. All-in-all, a fine cinema experience.",1308700800,,716,4.925619834710743
2043951,5,B0001YYNTE,This is one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen.  Certainly in the top 10.  Great music.  Outstanding acting.  Wonderful actors and a touch of history.  Terrific for the entire family.  My daughter used to sing these songs when she was little.  I absolutely had to have this and finally found it on Amazon.  Don't hesitate to buy this DVD.  See if you can recognize the actors.  They were much younger in this movie than now.  It kind of shows you how they started.,1229040000,2,470,4.411764705882353
2043952,5,B0001YYNTE,Even though this used product was not in working order when we recieved it. The seller was quick to send a refund without a hassle. Would definately buy from this seller again,1169164800,,175,4.5
2043963,3,B0001YYNTE,i loved the music and the actors are excellent but... the political theme was drenched in everything and it made it difficult for the kids to stay connected,1454025600,,156,4.607142857142857
2043964,5,B0001YYNTE,Great movie!  Loved it as a child and the music is delightful!,1449014400,,62,4.166666666666667

2043966,5,B0001YYNTE,"I have never been sure why this musical was not better rated, except for the fact that it was released during the height of the ""anti-movie-musical"" period (late 1960's - current).  This is a clear throwback to the days of Rogers & Hammerstein musicals, with both a love story and intrigue.  Going forward, only the certainly non-family musicals would draw great attention and reviews (Cabaret, Chicago, etc.).  This movie has great songs, dance numbers, a cantankerous, politically opinionated grandfather, a musically talented family with eight kids, and the story of the Dakota Territory statehood and a presidential election in which the winner had far fewer actual votes than the loser, with the electoral college choosing Benjamin Harrison (R) over Grover Cleveland (D-Incumbent).  PERFECT FAMILY FARE!",1444176000,3,808,5.44
2043967,1,B0001YYNTE,"I used to live where this movie was premiered at, it was quickly forgotten. If you buy it you'll wish you hadn't, it is horrible!",1436486400,,129,4.2
2043968,5,B0001YYNTE,"A really funny, family oriented, erstwhile political, movie.  Walter Brennan at his crankiest!  worth your time to watch, I think.",1433721600,,130,5.45
2043969,4,B0001YYNTE,"Cute movie. I prefer ""The Happiest Millionaire,"" also starring Lesley Ann Warren and John Davidson. But, this movie was cute and it offered an entertaining experience.",1425168000,,167,5.461538461538462
2043970,5,B0001YYNTE,Wonderful family movie with fun songs and dancing! Patriotism and strong family relations are the backbone of the plot which makes it more attractive to have your children enjoy the experience of watching it.,1412640000,,208,5.147058823529412
2043971,5,B0001YYNTE,You must watch this classic I can not ever say I have gotten bored watching this classic movie now even my grandkids like to watch it at NaNa's and PaPa's when they come to visit so its worth the purchase,1409270400,,204,4.125
2043972,4,B0001YYNTE,It is an oldie but a goodie!  Lots of early talent to see that have been used numerous times in future Disney films.  Lots of singing.,1395792000,,134,4.115384615384615
2043999,4,B0001YYNTE,"Somehow I had never seen this movie before.  I was amazed to see how many big stars of the day (Walter Brennan, Buddy Ebsen) and stars of the future (Kurt Russell, Goldie Hawn) were in this movie.  It was a lot of fun to watch.",1393804800,,227,4.022222222222222
2044000,5,B0001YYNTE,"I loved watching this movie as a child and often am amazed when I bring it up, at the number of people who have never heard of it. The One And Only Original Family Band is a classic. I grinned the entire time I rewatched this movie.",1392508800,2,232,3.9574468085106385
2044001,5,B0001YYNTE,"I have a problem. When I purchased the ""Original Family Band"" I was asked if it was for a ""Kindle"" tablet and I mistakenly checked yes.  Actually it was for a ""nook"" tablet from B&N. Is there a way to get that film I purchased out of the Kindle library and be able to stream it to my ""nook"" tablet?  Thank you, Noel J Becar.

2044002,5,B0001YYNTE,I watched this a bunch of times with my kids.  I think I like it better than them though.  Check it out,1390521600,,103,3.6363636363636362

2044004,5,B0001YYNTE,"This is one of my favorite all-time movies.  I saw it when it first came out, and I watch the dvd every now and then. It gives a great insight into the politics of the day, which seem eerily like politics today, and takes place at the time when Dakota was split up into North and South.  The music is fabulous, I especially like ""Ten Feet Off The Ground"" and the rousing ""West 'o the Wide Missouri"".  There's a very young Kurt Russell, and the theatrical debut of one Goldie Hawn.  Walter Brennan is as lovable and crusty as you remember, and it's a fine showcase for the talents of Buddy Ebsen (I love him doing the ""old soft shoe""!)  When I was young I wanted to be Lesly Ann Warren and I wanted to be with John Davidson, reunited again after their success in ""The Happiest Millionaire"".  It's a corny, sappy movie with adorable children, loves won and lost, a little American history and lots of peppy music.  I love it completely.  hmmm...now that I've written this, I'm going to pop it in the dvd and enjoy it once again right now!",1376611200,,1036,4.331606217616581
2044005,4,B0001YYNTE,"A superfamilyoriented, typical Disney family movie!  I would recommend showing it your children (but they'll probably think it's corny, and it is)...",1373846400,,149,5.7727272727272725
2044006,4,B0001YYNTE,This is great movie for the entire family. Typical 60's type - a bit hokey at times but it's great to not have to filter language or attitudes.,1368576000,,143,4.142857142857143
