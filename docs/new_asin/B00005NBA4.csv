1631855,3,B00005NBA4,"the fight scene between the actual monkey and cobra deserves two stars by itself. without that original scene the movie lacks big tyme, if anyone knows where i can get the original movie(un-cut) please hit me at cjmartin7@yahoo.com.",1064188800,2,232,5.131578947368421
1631856,4,B00005NBA4,"This is a great kung fu movie; gentle use of wires with some really talented martial artists going with genuine techniques from the styles they represent (monkey, drunken, snake).  Really cool, subtle ""special effects,"" too, such as a snake-stylist stripping bark from a tree with his fist, monkey-stylist leaping from tree trunk to tree trunk, etc.
Of note, however, is the censoring of a scene with a monkey fighting a cobra; probably removed at the behest of animal rights activists, I would be disgusted if the scene were filmed *today*, but hate to lose such a unique piece of film in a movie twenty years old.  Tragically overzealous.  The uncut original should be re-released.",1031702400,2,683,4.973684210526316
1631857,5,B00005NBA4,"This movie has it all.  Monkey vs Snake. 2 Snake warriors vs. a Drunken Boxing Teacher, a Student learns monkey and drunken boxing and combines them and kicks the Snake warriors'...!  A small bit of humor (very small) with great fight scenes and a pretty decent story.  If you love Snake style, Money style, and Drunken Boxing style then this movie is a MUST!",1031616000,2,359,4.578125
1631858,5,B00005NBA4,"I have not seen a movie that has emulated the snake and monkey style as good as this movie. The snake in 'deadly venoms' and the monkey in 'seven grandmasters' can't even come close to the performances in this one. Truly a classic as far as animal- imitating kung fu is concerned.
This movie is my favorite and I guarantee any kung fu lover to get their hands on this one.",1021680000,4,372,4.253521126760563
1631859,3,B00005NBA4,"This is an excellent movie, complete with the required 'plot' thread: student gets beaten and humiliated, student improves his kung-fu, student comes back for some serious ... revenge. The movie itself is worthy of 5 stars, but unfortunately this Xenon Pictures DVD release has removed a crucial scene (and also all the flashbacks to it) where we see a real monkey fight with a live snake. Without this scene, the viewer is likely to be left wondering how on earth the student was able to come up with all his 'winning' moves. As for animal rights activists; prohibiting this sort of scene in newly made titles is one thing, but removing a fundamental plot element from a movie that was made over 20 years ago is absolutely ridiculous!",1018656000,6,735,4.75

1631862,5,B00005NBA4,"Wow!  I just baught this movie with out seeing it first.  I was a bit  worried that i might have made a silly mistake, but  was i totally wrong.  This is definately one of the top 5 martial arts films i have seen.  Never  have i seen the displays in the Monkey style, snake style, and especially  the drunken style like in this superb movie.  Every fight scene is well  choreographed, the story is perfect, and the shapes and styles speak for  themselves. If you see this on the shelf and don't grab it you have surely  made a big mistake.",965520000,2,539,4.227722772277228

7946770,3,B00005NBA4,"I've seen an enormous amount of old-school kung fu in my day, and a lot of the enjoyment I get from it depends directly on whether or not I'm watching the same bad comedy I've seen a million times before.  I would've liked this a lot more had it been within the first couple of dozen fu flicks I'd ever seen.  However, just as it started being cliche, it started to weave a little spell on me and I ended up liking it quite a bit.  There's some originality waiting to surprise patient viewers.

We begin with a Monkey stylist (Pomson Shi, ""Star Runner"") fighting a Snake stylist (Charlie Chan, ""Legend of a Fighter"")!  Not too shabby.  The Monkey fighter is not only victorious, but virtuous and refuses to kill his opponent.  It then cuts to a young man (John Chang, ""Project A"") who delivers fish but neglects his work to sneak to the roof of the local school and watch them practice Drunken Boxing.  He eventually talks the master (Hau Chiu Sing, ""Sun Dragon"") into taking him as a student. Around the same time he meets the Monkey master who saves him from a potential attack by a cobra.  Soon afterward, two Snake fighters (Chan again, accompanied by the always awesome Wilson Tong, ""Daggers 8"") kill both his masters and he must come up with his own hybrid style to defeat them.

I knew when I purchased this that the infamous ""baboon fighting the cobra"" scene was deleted, which is the entire basis for Chang's climactic style.  There are uncut versions available, but I'm told that they have terrible picture quality.  This was cheaper and I figured if I liked it enough, I would eventually get it uncut.  Not sure if I will or not.  It's good, but not quite a classic.  I will say that the final fight is pretty good, and the way Chang takes out the two snakes (Chan especially) is awesome.  I also like the way the story unfolds.  Now this ain't a Thomas Harris novel, but it's a little more structured and confident than much of its breed.

This version from Xenon is full-screen and English dubbed only.  Though there is no mention of remastering, the picture quality looks better than many of their releases that actually claim to be remastered.  There is only one special feature but it's interesting.  I'm not sure why, but there are major fight scenes (not trailers) from ""Invincible Obsessed Fighter"", ""Fearless Dragons"", ""Jade Claw"", and ""Fighting Ace"", respectively.  Not what I would've put for special features, but hell yeah!  Recommended for collectors and animal-style-enthusiasts, though you may want to wait for a better, complete version.

7946771,4,B00005NBA4,"It's really a 5* flick a lot of missing scenes, you will be hard press to find the orginal copy even the vhs copy has the same missing scenes will almost the same missing scenes buy the flick anyway the kung-fu is the best the villian uses the snake style

I love watching kung fu flicks for the langh because of the english dub, but most of all the fighting styles, snake, tiger, buddha fist, crane, monkey, eagle, drunken fist boxing... I just like clear cut choreograph moves I've seen flicks after training and when it's time for that ""REVENGE"" they are still bad fighters. 9 times out 10 if the actors are good in one flick you like they may be good in another so check the names, anyway I really like the snake style in most movies everybody can't use this style with precise technique.

  Holla at dubose123@veriozn.net tell me your best flicks and I will share minds ""Were u just using the wu tang style against me?"" Forgive me I've learned so many styles...Shaolon vs Lama",1146528000,3,981,4.4636871508379885
