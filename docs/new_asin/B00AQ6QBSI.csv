8556156,5,B00AQ6QBSI,"THE EXECUTION OF WANDA JEAN is well-made and worth seeing. Clearly the filmmaker had no agenda or axe to grind. All sides are fairly presented; viewers aren't led or told what to think, and that's admirable.

Capital punishment is one of those polarizing topics that few have no opinion on.

I believe in the death penalty and that ""an eye for an eye"" is an instruction to men and not the province solely of the Almighty. I also believe in ""Instant Karma,"" meaning the wrongs a person does in THIS life will be paid for in THIS life, and sooner than one would imagine. In the case of Miss Allen, that karma took over a decade but it finally got her, and justifiably.

A deciding factor to my mind that Wanda Jean Allen earned an execution day is the overwhelming evidence of premeditation. Besides a similar prior murder, a greeting card that Wanda gave the victim contained in her own hand, ""If you try to leave me, I'll kill you."" It matters not if this is the threat of a genius or someone with just enough intelligence to hold down a medical-related job, as was the case with Miss Allen. Her prediction became tragic reality after a chase that ended at a police station parking lot. Gloria Leathers was sent to an early grave by a point-blank bullet to the belly, and Wanda Jean's fate was sealed by her own hand.",1492732800,,1317,4.45643153526971
