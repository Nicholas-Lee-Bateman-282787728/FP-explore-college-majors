1975115,5,B00016RNO4,I highly recommed this one for anyone who loves a good laugh. She is so funny and can be without being filled with filthy words. I wish I could have more DVDs of her she is so funny.,1217289600,4,182,3.8157894736842106
1975116,5,B00016RNO4,TRULY HILARIOUS!!! Rita has been one of my favorite comediennes for some time and she hasn't lost any of her humor over the years. I love the fact that she can still be very funny without the use of swear words or putting anyone down. Hearing her proves that laughter really is the best medicine and this DVD is a sure cure for the blues.  The special features are plentiful and very funny as well. A nice bonus to a DVD that's well worth the price for the standup alone.,1216598400,,471,4.233333333333333
1975117,5,B00016RNO4,"After having seen Rita's show in Las Vegas twice, buying this video was just like taking another trip to Vegas and going to her show again.  It's also great to share it with friends who really aren't that familiar with her work.",1215993600,,228,4.428571428571429
1975118,5,B00016RNO4,"I saw this on PBS and had to get it for my mother.  And every time I watch it, I roar.  Great fun and only an hour.  It's unusual to find somebody genuinely funny these days without a lot of sex and swearing. And it's in Las Vegas.",1215907200,,231,3.7708333333333335
1975119,5,B00016RNO4,"Rita Rudner is someone who can make you laugh without even trying.  She's not one of those comedians who constantly have to shout, or curse like a sailor.  In fact her very light and easy to listen to voice is what makes her so hilarious.  When she performs, she makes you feel like you are talking to an old friend who just happens to make you laugh by what they say.  She talks about things that all of us can relate to.  She mostly talks about female life and makes fun of the way men don't understand their wives.  But she also makes fun of herself and defends the husbands as well.  Most of the things that you find yourself laughing at are probably things you would unintentionally say to a friend and you would both have a good laugh over it.

I had the pleasure of seeing Rita's show in Las Vegas back in 2004.  I also had the pleasure of meeting her afterwards.  I was very pleased to hear some of the same jokes she used when I saw her live, to be put onto this dvd.

There's over 20 minutes of special features that were taken from Rita's short lived talk show ""Ask Rita"" where she went to special events like a Star Trek Convention, A Fishing Expo, A Ventriloquist Wedding, and she would interview people there and try some of the things out herself.

Some of my favorite quotes from the live show are:

""One time for my husbands birthday I decided to order a massage therapist to come to the house and give him a massage.  Good idea right?  I open the door and it's this 20 year old blond girl and she says in a perky voice 'Hi I'm here to give your husband a massage!' I looked at her and I said 'He's dead' ""

""I try to do everything for my daughter.  Once when she was 2.  She brought home a helium balloon.  She brought it inside, let it go and it flew up to the ceiling.  She looked at me and said 'Mommy get it'  So I pulled out the ladder and I got it down for her.  Then she brought it outside....She let go of it and it flew up to the sky.  She looked at me with those sad blue eyes and said ""Mommy get it"".  I didn't have the heart to tell her that there are some things that I just couldn't do for her.  So I said to her ""Ask Daddy to get it""

""I got a doctor once who was so young that he looked just like Justin Timberlake.  He asked 'may I take your heartbeat?'  I said 'Why don't you just download it?'

And there are many more from that!  And who could keep their eyes off that ever so attractive DVD cover?  The cover gets your attention, and her show will make you watch the whole thing.",1214438400,13,2518,4.046653144016227
1975120,3,B00016RNO4,"I bought the DVD because I saw Rudner on my local PBS station.  They showed portions of her Vegas act, which was hilarious, especially for those 40ish and over, and most would rate it in the ""G"" category.  Even the local public station lauded her by saying, in effect, ""You don't have to be vulgar, indecent or use off-color language to do stand-up comedy.""

Well, apparently, they did not see the extra hour of ""Special Features.""  Although most of this added material is quite acceptable, two (and expecially one) is definitely scraping the bottom in the ""R"" rating category because of it being oriented toward sleezy sexual content.  Yea, everyone being filmed--including Rita--is laughing (or lusting) up a storm, but some of your family members and friends may not.

Rudner is definitely witty, a good observer of the comedy in living, but now I can't share the DVD with others because of her poor judgment with the ""Special Features"" section.  I could give the main hour an ""A"" and the additional features--on balance--a ""D.""  But, again, you won't want to watch some of that section with certain others--and I didn't like the sexually bawdy segment myself.

Yea! for the more wholesome Rita; ""Boo!"" for that other (now public) side of her.",1214352000,9,1246,4.867298578199052

1975122,5,B00016RNO4,"It's been said there's... good jokes and clean jokes. Rita's routine is a rarity of comic gems without sexual innuendo or political shots, just keen and funny observations that anyone could relate to.

1975131,5,B00016RNO4,"I have seen Rita Rudner's show in Vegas a couple of times and I loved her.  I bought this DVD to show a group of friends, and they loved her as well. She is hysterical and she is not a vulgar comedian, which in this day and age is refreshing.  Her act has a lot to do with the day to day relationships of men and women.  So funny, and so true.  I met her a couple of times in person.  She always made eye contact, and asked my name.  She is very personable, and I am happy to endorse her DVD.",1439424000,,492,3.7745098039215685

This performance is straight from her super popular Las Vegas show.  You are in the audience and enjoying every moment.  I have invited friends to my home for dinner and a show, as this is appropriate for everyone.

I purchased this DVD after seeing her in person, and some friends have had me purchase it for them after seeing it with me at home.

It was great!

Rita is in the highest-level of comedians, such as Jerry Seinfeld and Ray Ramano.

She is so unbelievably funny without having to get into the gutter where most stand-up comedians thrive. Because, they just can't be original and funny without being stupid, dirty and/or petty, such as Rosanne Barr.",1273968000,2,366,4.6875
