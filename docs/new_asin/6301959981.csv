382558,5,6301959981,"This is a fun WWI movie from the 1970s that I enjoyed while growing up and before Warner finally got its act together and provided us with a DVD to Order for the title fans of the movie were forced to watch the VCD to view the movie in their DVD players which was less than satisfactory given that the VCD storage limit meant the movie was split into two.

Whereas movies centering around WWII are numerous, the same is not true about the ""Great War."" This movie therefore offers a fascinating (and exciting) glimpse at a conflict in which aerial warfare was still in its infancy.

It should hardly be surprising that I like this movie, its an espionage drama revolving around an airship and one of my favorite of the James Bond movies is A VIEW TO A KILL which was an espionage drama with a climactic battle around an airship. But most of all the movie is also directed by Belgian-born director Etienne Perier who also directed my all-time favorite spy movie ""When Eight Bells Toll,"" based around the Alistair MacLean novel of the same name (check out my review of that movie here on Amazon.)

Starring in this movie as the unlikely hero Geoffrey von Richter-Douglas is Michael York. His character is a British soldier with German roots who is sent by British intelligence to get information on a new German super-weapon the LZ36, and ends up aboard one bound for an attack on a Scottish castle and the destruction of the Magna Carta. Co-starring alongside York is the incredibly beautiful Elke Sommer who plays Frau Dr. Ericka Altschul, the wife of the airship's designer who is less than convinced by Richter-Douglas' defection to the German side. Hoping to gather the information needed Richter-Douglas talks his way on board the zeppelin for it's ""trial run"" only to learn that instead of it being a ""trial run"" it is actually a secret attack on the aforementioned castle. The Germans believe that the destruction of the ""British constitution"" will have a demoralizing effect on the British people. It's up to Richter-Douglas to thwart the plan from within.

While The story does not fully develop the theme of divided loyalty completely the Richter-Douglas character is an interesting one and the viewer is made to wonder where his ultimate loyalties will eventually lie. Ultimately the movie starts a little slow and picks up in the second act as the zeppelin sets off for the raid, the battle at the castle and the final escape across the channel.

It's entertaining hokum and the battle as English biplanes attempt to bring the blimp down in the closing minutes is exciting, but don't expect it to be the most accurate of movies.

Examples of problems include the fact that it wasn't until the 1920s that The technique of mooring an airship to a tower was developed. The film is set in 1915 but it features the SE5a fighter plane which didn't enter service until two years later and. the British also didn't have the machinery for firing a machine gun through a spinning propeller until 1916.

Still, even given these technical problems the movie is one of those perfectly designed for those rainy Saturday afternoons when all you want to do is curl up on the coach with a hot chocolate while watching an entertaining movie.",1145577600,10,3233,4.731793960923623
382559,4,6301959981,"The Michael York character in this 1971 movie is no James Bond type, as seen in ""A View to a Kill"" (1985), where airships were also key to the plot, yet it is clear that he was being forced to choose between the two major warring European powers during the First World War as regards his loyalties.

The plot centres around what appears to be a ""simple"" task for one Lt. Geoffrey Richter-Douglas, a man with German roots yet serving in a minor role in the British Army: get back to Germany and find out all the technical details of a new Navy Zeppelin called the LZ36, the latest in a series of airships used for the strategic bombing of British cities in 1915 in order to terrify the civilian population.

Having been deliberately shot in the arm (literally) in order to convince the Germans that he was genuinely turning his back on the British, Richter-Douglas finds that the purpose of the new airship's sole mission is much more sinister than that - no bombs are on board, for a start. This mission outrages the airship's designer, Professor Altschul (Marius Goring) and worries his wife, Erika (Elke Sommer). Erika keeps her feelings for Richter-Douglas carefully neutral, and her contention that he is actually still working for the British to herself.

The Scotsman is nearly discovered, but he despatches one crewmember in a particularly brutal fight and dumps him over the side while the Zeppelin is still in flight; fortunately for him, the ruse that he was trying to save him fooled the commander of the ship (Andrew Keir) and the army colonel (Anton Diffring) leading the mission.

The mission (which I won't reveal here) ultimately fails, but without his help, though Erika's presence appears to add little to the plot except provide a distraction to the otherwise male-dominated scenario, as military missions in those days tended to be. The most exciting part is perhaps the aerial battle where British fighters try and put as many bullet holes into the airship as possible before the ship climbs out of reach when many things (including the bodies of killed crewmembers) are themselves dumped over the side.

Nonetheless, the ship is heading for a ""Hindenburg""-style fiery death as (for some reason never explained) the ship loses height and crashes into the North Sea by the Dutch coast. Perhaps predictably, both Richter-Douglas and Erika are the only survivors of what was a doomed mission (from the British point of view, it could only be doomed).

As espionage stories go, this one would have been better had the action not been so plodding at times: one might even say that the mid-North Sea fuel stop was a rest-stop for the movie itself. It is really only from when the enemy airship reaches its destination that the action really does get going. For fans of airships past and present, it is memorable for the fact that the set used for the inside of the ship was remarkably detailed and that the genuine airship sheds at Cardington, which still exist, were used as a backdrop.

Overall, however, it is a good film to watch because, unlike others, it focuses mostly on the troubled psyche of the man, who is clearly being made a pawn by both sides to get what they want, and does not attempt to glorify war. The subtle anti-war message comes when Erika asks him to comment on the failure of the mission, and he says bluntly that he ""didn't want any of it"". For him, survival was his top priority - what anyone else wanted did not matter to him, even if he never had to take a stand against either side.",1107129600,8,3527,4.688206785137318
382560,4,6301959981,What cab I say ? I directed this incredible film and we all had a lot of fun .great shooting in England and Malta . I'd do it over again if I had the chance !,1105142400,4,158,3.4166666666666665
382561,3,6301959981,"This action-adventure flick is a mixed blessing.  Michael York is more awkward than heroic as a reluctant WWI spy, who is afraid of heights.  Naturally, the British send him on a mission that involves a zeppelin that flies at 15,000 feet.  His inexperience at espionage leads to clumsy attempts at humor.  The comic book plot is of the newly developed super zeppelin, LZ36.  The Germans fly the great airship on a daring mission to remote Scotland to capture the British archives, including the Magna Carta itself.  The movie's virtues are the airborne photography and the special effects.  The realization of a WWI zeppelin is a triumph of non-computerized visual display.  The aerial combat scenes of WWI era planes attacking the zeppelin are exciting, and should please aviation history buffs.  The blood and thunder of the attack on the castle that houses the archives will satisfy action fans.  Casting the delectable Elke Sommer may have been commercially viable, but her role as a zeppelin engineer married to an older, absent-minded professor is not a good fit.  Her interactions with York are dull rather than provocative.  Covering her curves with a bulky flying suit was poor use of her natural talents.  Zeppelins and vintage aircraft are fine.  In that light, the movie is worth the price.

382562,3,6301959981,"The setting is WWI Britain.  A young, German-born, Scottish officer, played by Michael York, has a desk job with the ministry partly due to problems with vertigo.  He is recruited to act as a spy and return to Germany to find out what he can about the new Zeppelin project.
The premise sounded good, but many of the elements needed to make this into a great story were thrown in haphazardly.  His lover seems to be more important than is told in the story.  His connections to a well known, German scientist seems serendipitous.  His vertigo and divided loyalties are touched on lightly then disregarded.  By the time I felt the elements would be pulled together, the movie was over, leaving me mildly disappointed.
Elke Sommers is very attractive, but I am not sure why she was in the movie.  She had a speaking part, but I don't find that her role was necessary.  My guess is that the producers wanted an attractive lady to put on the movie poster.
I would not recommend seeing this movie.",1026345600,2,991,4.559322033898305

The airship's internal details are very impressing, and the battle with airplanes is really rich in details. I think this Warner's production is excellent.

382564,3,6301959981,"A 1972 classic movie starring a very young Michael York as a British lieutenant and a very attractive Elke Sommer as the wife of old Zeppelin designer Altschul (a Count Zeppelin/Nutty Professor  derivative). York, who has German family ties and is a family friend  of Herr Altschul's, apparently changes sides and enlists in the German  Army. For reasons unknown to him, he is whisked aboard the newest  Zeppelin for a ""test flight"". After passing its trials, the  ship is commandeered and refueled for a raid on Scotland. With  civilians aboard, the LZ36 starts its wild ride, and York is used for  navigation during the raid. Duty to country and loyalty to friends are  tested as York tries to foil the German's nefarious plan.
A very  noble effort for 1972. A passable plot with reasonably good  acting. The special effects include a nice zeppelin model (albeit a  bit blunt-nosed) flying through the clouds, a few spy basket shots,  and properly cluttered (but a bit roomy) internal catwalks. Shots of  York and the crew climbing up the exposed ladder from the control car  into the hull do convey the idea of extreme conditions in a fragile  machine.
Even though it's not Oscar material, ""Zeppelin""  IS entertaining, and certainly belongs in the collection of any LTA  fan. There aren't that many movies themed around airships, but this  one definitely wins the prize for the prettiest co-star, Elke.  END",902793600,19,1410,4.923404255319149

382777,3,6301959981,"Even in the Golden Age of Hollywood, the carnage of World War One always made it a difficult setting for adventure films, but 1971's Zeppelin gets around that by sidestepping the war on the ground for a ripping yarn largely set on one of the elegant but deadly airships. Michael York's the nice-but-bland deskbound half-German half-Scottish British officer with an impeccably British accent and a bad case of vertigo who is recruited by Alexandra Stewart's Mata Hari-like spy to join his German relatives and help with their latest experimental Zeppelin. Of course, he's really working for the Brits all along - something designer's wife Elke Sommer guesses right from the start but does nothing about - but before he can get down to any serious spying he's whisked off on a test flight that turns out to be cover for a secret mission over Scotland. It's the kind of rather cosy, reasonably well-mounted film that the British film industry was still turning out in the early 70s even though audiences were abandoning them. Short on action and incident until things perk up considerably in the final raid, it relies instead on mystery as to what the devious plan is, not generating much suspense or threat aside from one sequence with a radio operator but floating along effectively enough in its Sunday teatime telly viewing way.

J. Paul Getty Sr.'s company may have made a tidy sum selling oil to the Germans for their airships, but when his son Ronald decided to try his luck as a producer, the old man was reluctant to see much of that money going in the opposite direction, and you do get the impression at times that the script got scaled down to fit the fairly modest budget. Nonetheless, the special effects are mostly pretty decent there's a good cast of the usual suspects like Anton Diffring in his default charmingly distrustful aristocratic Hun mode, Peter Carsten as his Aryan ubermensch cohort and British movie regulars like Andrew Keir, Marius Goring and Rupert Davies along for the flight. Despite opening with an air raid it's rather short of thrills, never being particularly thrilling until its satisfying finale but compensating somewhat with an impressive use of the widescreen frame despite its often-cramped quarters. There's also some guilty fun to be had waiting for some of the Germans to display their heavily telegraphed lemming-like tendencies when the ship needs to lose some weight. While there's little sense of danger in the film, the crew weren't so lucky - during the filming famed aerial cinematographer Skeets Kelly (Battle of Britain, The Blue Max, Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines) and three others died in a helicopter/plane collision. But for that tragic accident the worst you could say about the film is that it's harmless enough, and that if it's not the action-packed white-knuckle ride some may hope for it does eventually deliver its payload.

Considering this was made in 1971, it's actually held up pretty well--better than many other, more well-known 70's movies.

If you can find it on sale or in a bargain bin, pick it up.  It's honestly not a waste of a few bucks.",1348444800,,811,4.395973154362416
382819,5,6301959981,"Zeppelin is a very good WW1 movie that stars Michael York and Elke Sommer and it has a great cast of English and German Actors. Set in 1915 and York's character is Half English - Half German and as he speaks fluent German, he is sent to Friedrichshafen, Germany to spy on the latest Zeppelin Airship, the LZ 36 and on some German family friends. He finally gets to see the LZ 36 and is asked to come on the Airship's maiden test flight. To his and the Zeppelin Crew's surprise, he is about to go a German mission to invade Scotland and steal something very valuable to Britain - the Magna Carter!.",1345161600,,597,4.292035398230088
382820,5,6301959981,"This was the first movie I remember seeing at the old theater in my home town when I was 6 years old. A lifelong love of airships was born out of this great action movie, along with becoming a Michael York fan, a sucker for a beautiful Fraulein with a Bavarian accent, among others. Roy Budd's memorable score, along with the fantastic opening theme, are among the highlights of this WW1 adventure. If you love action movies, WW1 era airplanes, or just a nearly two hour escape into a story that critics have described as ""Jules Verne Meets James Bond"", this is your movie!",1331596800,,573,4.519230769230769
382821,5,6301959981,"This movie lags a bit in the beginning but if you give it your attention, the pace picks up and it becomes a very good story. The acting and special effects are excellent. I highly recommend this movie if you are into the Hindenburg Disaster or you just love zeppelins.",1316131200,,269,4.4
382822,5,6301959981,"at long last a proper copy of this movie,saw this film in the cinema back in 1971,it was shown in 70 mm,but all home video versions have been pan and scan until this beauty,don`t buy the spainsh release as it`s just sub standard,not the best war film and does not tell you much about Zeppelin`s,but if you buy this copy worth keeping in anybodies collection,good rainny day viewing,never watch a tv showing as again it`s shown in the wrong picture mode,well done to warner archive,even the mono sounds good,only down side picture is a bit soft,but not dvd issues,just original film transfer.",1311811200,4,591,4.803921568627451
382823,5,6301959981,"I have been waiting for a release of this 1971 adventure film for years!  I owned a VHS that I made from AMC (before they went commercial) which was OK to watch, but fuzzy and in full screen format.  Many years back I transferred it to DVD just to have a copy that wouldn't degrade further.  So you can imagine my delight at this official archival release.

The copy is excellent for its age (yeah, it could have been fully remastered, but it still looks great).  The colors are crisp and clean, the soundtrack clear and resonate. You can see the detail the film makers put into the sets and, particularly, the stunning model work.  I may be old fasioned, but to my mind most of todays computer generated models look, well, computer generated.  Guess I'm just old school!

I applaud all those responsible for bringing back a film which I thought I was the only person in the world remembered!",1298419200,43,892,4.496894409937888

7817471,3,6301959981,"The movie itself is OK, but the acting is a little weak.  The video quality is soft; almost VHS level, and the opening credits are indicative of this.

For the movie itself, I would recommend starting the movie at the scene with the model zeppelin and two white balloons in the field.  The preceding endless dialog can be skipped.  The two redeeming qualities for the move are the zeppelin interior scenes and the cloud car that descends from the zeppelin.  My two sons and I enjoyed those facets of the movie.

To get a more complete immersion, I would recommend PBS's NOVA ""Terror Attack"" first, then ""Zeppelin"", then ""Airships, Blimps, Dirigibles and Zeppelins Old Films Hindenburg Akron Macon Roma Shenandoah Los Angeles DVD"".  The various books on Zeppelin's give more comprehensive info and I started with those before these videos.

With all of the miles that Zeppelin's logged around the world, I'm surprised that there isn't a  ""Come Fly with Us aboard the Zeppelin, using clean and safe hydrogen""  sales documentary or newsreal from the era.

This movie, Zeppelin, is certainly worth a watch once.",1504828800,,1107,4.92972972972973
