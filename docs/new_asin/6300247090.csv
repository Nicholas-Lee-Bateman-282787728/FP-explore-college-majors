268066,5,6300247090,"This film is an exceptional film wiht an ensemble cast.  Gregory Peck is the standout but the rest of the cast are what really make this a film to remember.  Dean Jagger as a recalled WWI veteran is exceptional as the  adjutant, a non-flier now,  but one who has been there.  His Oscar is well  deserved.  Gary Merrill and Millard Mitchell are also well cast and play  their roles well.  This film shows military leadership at it's most  influential, getting me to do what they ordinarily wouldn't, and then keep  on going back for more.  It isn't preachy, like Command Decision, but  rather gives a 'Your are there"" feeling.  I highly recommend this film  to everyone.",956361600,3,669,4.646551724137931
268067,5,6300247090,"This is not a traditional action based war movie. In fact, apart from one mission near the end, it is set entirely on the ground.
However, the film shows the real horrors of war in a matter of fact way that no other film of  the time did. For instance, early on the doctor commenting on a severely  wounded, delirious pilot: ""I wouldn't have believed it if I wasn't  looking at it. You can see his brain.""
The film dissects various  leadership styles, showing the merits and faults of each - but in a  dramatic way. Col. Davenport, who cares about his men, and gets their  loyalty - but who eventually crumbles under the strain. Hard nosed General  Savage's by the book ""they're men - not boys"" style - until he  begins to care too much as well. And General Pritchard overlooking it  all.
Henry King knew he had a great script and cast. He basically just  pointed his cameras at the actors and let them get on with it. The film is  full of long one-take scenes. The scene where Savage dresses down Gately  clocks in at some 6 minutes of continuous film with no cuts.
No  violence. No ""lurve"" scenes or romance. Just a deeply rewarding  film experience for adults looking for more than mindless action.",955670400,35,1201,4.4495412844036695
268068,5,6300247090,"If you're only going to watch one WWII air combat film in your life it should be this one. This is also one of the six greatest WWII films of all time, along with ""The Longest Day,"" ""Das Boot,""  ""Schindler's List,"" ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and  ""The Best Years of Our Lives."" If you see them all, you'll have  seen the best representations of the many theaters of combat that made up  the Second World War. Not overly glamorized or contrived like most of its  contemporaries, ""Twelve O'Clock High"" serves as a role model for  any study of leadership under fire. It's frequently used by many of todays  best military training instutes for leadership training. It also stands  out, along with ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" as Peck's greatest role.  Long overdue for a cleaned-up laserdisc or DVD release.",950227200,9,795,4.744525547445256
268069,5,6300247090,"Outstanding feature about an Army Air Force general officer called in to fix a B-17 bomber group struggling to meet mission.  Set in the 1943 when the US Army Air Force was fighting to establish a credible air offensive against Germany; high losses and operational tempo have taken their toll on the airmen of the 918th Bomb Group.  The 8th Air Force commander sacks the bomb group's leader and brings in General Savage (Gregory Peck) to reverse their downward spiral before it infects the rest of the groups.

The human factor in this picture is remarkable as General Savage pushes the group hard to regain its composure while the war continues to consume men and airplanes.  Gregory Peck is tremendous in his portrayal and the supporting cast provides an excellent variety of characters.  While intense, the story is balanced with a good amount of humor and personal triumph as the airmen climb out of their slump.  Particular highlights are the group adjutant Major Stovall (Dean Jagger) who keeps matters in perspective with a certain amount of wit; Savage's driver (Robert Arthur) who is busted and promoted repeatedly; and malingering pilot Lieutenant Colonel Gately (Hugh Marlowe) who rises to the occasion.  Center-stage remains with Savage however, dealing with the stress of command during a grim period of the Air Force's history, providing some very interesting insights on leadership.

Wrapped around this human drama are production sets with authentic B-17s and airfields that look like the real thing.  While there's more drama on the ground than in the air, the movie does portray a bombing mission with actual combat footage, and there's a spectacular B-17 emergency landing sequence at the beginning of the film.

Probably the best film about airmen in World War II and my personal favorite among the ""bomber"" flicks.

If you like this one, you'll like the 1943 documentary ""Memphis Belle.""  Similar noteworthy films: 1955's ""Strategic Air Command;"" 1957's ""Bombers B-52;"" 1962's ""The War Lover,"" featuring Steve McQueen; 1963's ""Gathering of Eagles,"" which appears to be a cold-war remake of ""Twelve O'Clock High;"" and 1990's ""Memphis Belle,"" which features spectacular flight scenes.",944611200,,2203,5.209631728045326
268070,5,6300247090,"The movie shows us what occurs on a higher level of command than the average airman is exposed to. Officers coming to grips (and not very well) with the fact that they are sending young men to their deaths is the focal point of the story. The acting is exemplary  and the most telling thing is the realism. In Gerald Astor's book The  Mighty Eighth it states if you want to see what the air war in Europe was  all about see 12 O'clock High becasue Bernie Lay, the coauthor of the book  was a pilot with a bomber group flying out of England. If you want to  see an unrealistic portrayal watch The Memphis Belle. I have watched this  film over the years since it's release in'49 and have never tired of it and  its participants. If you doubt the veracity of the film I suggest you buy  the book mentioned above. Watching the actual combat film, used here very sparingly, is a  frightening experience and Henry King did  a masterful job in directing the film. Tops!!",938390400,,963,4.359550561797753

268209,5,6300247090,"Well done WW II drama involving Gregory Peck as a Brigadier General brought in to make a bomber squadron proud and productive, once again.
I thought this was well done with Mr. Peck giving his best. The officers under his new command don't like him at first, but once they realize that he means well, their Army pride in what they do is restored again with little casualties during their missions.
If you are looking for another ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" all the way through the picture, this is not the movie. It's a drama about a Bomb Squadron in Europe that isn't doing as well as it could be and (Gregory Peck) is sent in from his commanding officer, a 2 Star General, to fix the situation to the best of his ability.
There is some action from the bombers toward the end and a little here and there during the picture, which I loved as well.
This is not widescreen and it was shot in black and white. That is okay, because I like black and white movies also.
When I played this back on my video equipment, I found no problems playing the Blu-ray and it looked really good.

Hot Toasty Rag, August 10, 2017

My mom asked me the other day, Gregory Peck was so handsome. Why was he in military movies instead of love stories? My answer was that Greg was the picture of American integrity, and what better setting is there than a war movie to stand tall, look determined, and decide that for the greater good, you're going to do the right thing? In Twelve OClock High, thats exactly what Greg does.

He plays a tough-love bombardier general called in to whip a unit into shape. Since this movie was made in 1949, the use of actual war footage during the WW2 war scenes probably gave the audience a very emotional reaction. While this isn't my favorite war movie, I appreciate the acting and the obstacles in the plot.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: TWELVE OCLOCK HIGH is a 1949 film about the United States Army's Eighth Air Force crews who flew daylight bombing missions against Germany and occupied France during World War II. The film was adapted by Beirne Lay Jr., Sy Bartlett and Henry King (uncredited) and from the 1948 novel Twelve O'Clock High by Beirne Lay Jr. and Sy Bartlett. It was directed by Henry King and starred Gregory Peck as Brigadier General Frank Savage, Gary Merrill as Colonel Keith Davenport, Millard Mitchell as General Patrick Pritchard, Dean Jagger as Major Stovall and later on as Lieutenant Colonel Harvey Stovall, Hugh Marlowe as Lieutenant Colonel Ben Gately, and Robert Arthur as Sergeant McIllhenny.

TWELVE OCLOCK HIGH is Henry Kings superlative WWII drama was one of the first Hollywood films to probe realistically the psychological pressure and emotional toll of occupying high-command positions. The film examines the physical and emotional anxieties caused by giving the maximum effort day after day. The scenario is based on a novel by Sy Bartlett and Beirne Lay, Jr., who served in WWII under Air Force Brigadier General Frank Savage, where we see Gregory Peck in top form as usual, and the officer who directed the 1942 U.S. precision daylight bombings on German industry.  The writers had witnessed first-hand the effects of chronic fatigue and trauma as fliers out on risky, often deadly missions.

The opening scene is haunting and memorable, setting the tone for the rest of the tale.  Major Harvey Stovall [Dean Jagger], a bald, bespectacled man, wanders through post-war England, arriving at a former American air base, a neglected site overgrown with weeds.  Looking into the wide sky, he begins to recall as bomber squadrons return from the missions in Germany. When the saga begins, the 918th Bomber Group is under the command of Colonel Keith Davenport [Gary Merrill], a likable leader who behaves like a friend to his men. Indeed, its Davenports sympathy with his young men, which ultimately causes his breakdown and downfall. Overly concerned with their physical and mental welfare, after a succession of dangerous bombing missions, Colonel Keith Davenport seems unable to meet the demands of his superiors, General Pritchard [Millard Mitchell] and Brigadier General Frank Savage.

Relieved of his duties, Colonel Keith Davenport is replaced by Brigadier General Frank Savage, a ruthless leader whose single-minded goal is to whip his boys back into shape. To that extent, he cuts back on three-day passes, closes the local bar, demands to be saluted, and requires that his soldiers be suitably uniformed and properly behaved at all time. As a result, despair settles in and most of the pilots ask for transfer. Only exception is the young pilot Lt. Bishop [Bob Patten], a sensitive, slightly confused man who tries to rally the men. Moved by the show of unity, Brigadier General Frank Savage is forced to become increasingly friendly, which leads to greater identification with them than his despised predecessor.

Brigadier General Frank Savages character is modelled on the actual nervous breakdown of Air Corps Major General Frank A. Armstrong, whos depicted as a flesh-and-blood man burdened by phobias, fears, and inadequacies. Gregory Peck gives a flawless portrayal of Brigadier General Frank Savage. But the films pivotal performance is Dean Jaggers Major Harvey Stovall. An introspective, older military man, Major Harvey Stovall is a friend and assistant to both Colonel Keith Davenport and Brigadier General Frank Savage and having lived through WWI, he holds together the 918th Bomber Group.

The rather, nostalgic tone of the narration in the prologue is juxtaposed with a flashback of chaos, describing American bombers returning from a mission.  Base commander Colonel Keith Davenport gets out of his plane in a state of anxiety to immediately take stock of injuries and losses among his men. What do we do with his arm asks one man of another injured crew member. Our stinking luck, is Colonel Keith Davenports response for having experienced the worst losses of his air group.

Gregory Peck was eager but nervous to play Brigadier General Frank Savage since Gregory Peck had not served in the War due to 4-F classification, meaning that in the United States' Selective Service System, identifying a person as unfit for military service after formal examination by the Entrance Processing Command. But Gregory Peck gives one of his most intelligent and commanding performances, for which he deservedly earned his fourth Oscar nomination. In an early scene it depicts Brigadier General Frank Savages final moment of calm before storming onto the base. Stopping by a river, he lights a cigarette to relax his nerves and prepare for the demanding job before driving on.

Dean Jagger won a Supporting Oscar as Brigadier General Frank Savages right hand man, a re-tread doing a desk job that brings his civilian skills acquired as a lawyer. The entire male supporting cast is excellent, including Hugh Marlowe and Gary Merrill, Paul Stewart as the base doctor who asks for a working definition of maximum effort, and Millard Mitchell as the Major General who detects the same cracks in Brigadier General Frank Savages that had earlier defeated his  predecessor.

TWELVE OCLOCK HIGH displays excellent cinematography camerawork by the Oscar-winner Leon Shamroy, including the depiction of a most horrifying aerial attack sequence. Some of the movie was shot at Elgin Field in Florida, and the states Ozark Field stands in for the scenes of the overgrown field in the prologue and epilogue. The Motion Picture is humbly dedicated to those Americans, both living and deceased, whose gallant effort made possible daylight precision bombing. They were the only Americans fighting in Europe in the fall of 1942. They stood alone, against the enemy and against doubts from home and abroad. This is their story. The air battle scenes in this Motion Picture were taken from authentic combat footage by members of the United States Air Force and German Luftwaffe archives, some of which have never before seen by viewers.

TWELVE OCLOCK HIGH was one of the first major films about World War II to forgo a propagandistic approach and instead present the horrors of the conflict and particularly the psychological toll of warfare on its participants, in a realistic light. The film was routinely praised for its accurate portrayal of the experience of heavy bomber pilots during the war. TWELVE OCLOCK HIGH remains a powerful war film, its impact heightened by a complete absence of a film musical score, apart from over the credits, and the use of authentic footage of aerial combat scenes are also notable for using actual footage of combat missions shot by Allied and Luftwaffe (German air force) cameras and once again this American war film, released in 1949, that was noted for its ground-breaking depiction of the psychological effects of war on soldiers in general.

Blu-ray Video Quality  20th Century Fox Home Entertainment has once again brought you a stunning 1080p encoded black-and-white image that really enhances the excellent 1.33:1 aspect ratio, but what a shame it was not filmed in a widescreen ratio. There is also excellent news that there is a considerable improvement in clarity and sharpness that really makes watching this film a total enjoyment. The overall black levels are much richer with this new upgraded Blu-ray presentation than on the inferior DVD release. Also outstanding is the good contrast and the bulk of the film sports excellent differentiation in the grey scale, and Leon Shamroy's cinematography looks decidedly much clearer than it has in previous home video presentations.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  20th Century Fox Home Entertainment has really done this audio presentation proud, especially giving us a brilliant 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio full enhanced sound experience, which is very unusual for a film with a 1.33:1 aspect ratio. Unfortunately when it comes to the battle sequences it never really fulfils us with the surround sounds when it comes to the explosions and penetrating gunfire, but you do get some hint of the use of the back speakers when the bombers take off. It is really more aimed more towards the dialogue aspect of the film, and now and again you get mostly limited to discrete ambient environmental effects in a subtle way, than the overwhelming sounds of battle scenes that might have been, and these are placed quite artfully throughout the sound field as the film progresses. But I was quite impressed with the Alfred Newman's beautiful composed music score that really enhances the film, especially heard only in the opening and closing sequences of the film that really sounds totally magnificent for a Second World War score. So overall it is a very enjoyable sound experience.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary with Historians Rudy Behlmer, Jon Burlingame and Nick Redman: Here we are welcomed to this very special audio commentary and first to introduce themselves is Nick Redman, next to him is Rudy Belhmer and Jon Burlingame, and all are here to talk about the film TWELVE OCLOCK HIGH, and all three think this is one the greatest World War Two film of all time, as well as the armed service, who say it is a very accurate in portraying the bombing pilots. But I must say we get a truly wonderful audio commentary which is also totally informative and is never boring, as these three gentlemen complement each other magnificently. Rudy Behlmer is of course one of the premiere 20th Century Fox historians around, and Nick Redman who started up his own Twilight Time niche Blu-ray label, which has since starting the label has been releasing some really interesting 20th Century Fox titles. Jon Burlingame and Nick Redman are at the forefront of soundtrack restorations, including a number of notable 20th Century Fox Compact Disc releases. Rudy Behlmer, Jon Burlingame and Nick Redman discuss just about everything there is to discuss about this film, including the production, casting and the context of its involvement with post-World War II in America. As the film starts to get going, they all think it is a very interesting war film that was only made a few years after the end of the Second World War, as it really sets the scenario on what it is like to set up leader of the bombing squadron, and where it goes into great detail on what it is like to become a leader, as it does portray in this film. They talk about the significant of the Toby Jug in the shop window and how the RAF pilots used it to indicate when a raid was due, and eventually the American pilots embraced the same tactic.. They talk in detail about the Alfred Newman film score that you only hear at the start of the film and at the end of the film, especially when the credits appear, which in both cases they really feel it adds to the ambience of the film, where less is more. When you see the real B17 bomber landing on its belly because the landing gear was not working, this was done by a famous American movie stunt pilot named Paul Mantz (2nd August, 1903  8 the July, 1965) and was purposely made to do that landing because the B17 bomber was on its last legs and also only had a minimum amount of aviation fuel because of the danger it could of blown up. An interesting fact we hear about this film is that it is shown regularly at Executive Man Management classes, which might sound strange, but it is entirely makes sense, because the plot scenario to do with discipline in the face of adversity. We find out that Darryl F. Zanuck was more concerned about the script detail than anything else, and would say on several occasions that even more important that the script, is the idea, and if the idea is right, and he would also say that he would rather have a bad script on a good idea, than a great script on an idea, and also especially the subject matter you choose. But he would also say that the script is all important, because he felt that you know you can have great direction, great performance and great everything, but if the script isn't right, it all comes to naught. They give great praise towards the professional Cinematography in this film and especially Leon Shamroy who was very famous for a lot of 20th century Fox films and was truly one of the giants of his craft, who also worked extremely well in colour. Jon Burlingame and Nick Redman asks Rudy Behlmer if the film could have been shot in colour, but Rudy insists it has to be in black-and-white, because of the original combat aerial battle scenes were in black-and-white and the stark contrast would not of looked right, whereas Rudy feels this film has a very definite documentary feel to the film. They talk about the brilliant director Henry King, who Darryl F. Zanuck really admired and who felt would produce a really good war film but they also mention about the actor Gregory peck who had never worked with this director before, but the first time the actor met the director, Gregory Peck sensed an immediate affinity, especially the way Henry King handled things and the way he related to people and people always felt comfortable with the director, even if he did not have to rise to the occasion, and especially Darryl F. Zanuck felt that Henry King and Gregory Peck were very good for each other, but most of all we find out that Henry King was also a flyer and had been flying since the 1920s, even though he had never flown for either the army or navy, but he had his own private aircraft and would be known to scout locations with his private plane and would also take along his personal location manager. Rudy Behlmer mentions about the leading lady that is mentioned in the famous novel of the film, and a quote a love interest, and she was an RAF Lieutenant in England, and is not the main plot, but more as a romantic aspect with Savage and at the end of the novel walk off into the sunset and Darryl F. Zanuck found out that it had been added into the final draft of the screenplay, and in a memo from Darryl F. Zanuck said, Get rid of her, as she is has as much use in this film as one of the Keystone cops, and Darryl F. Zanuck also said, As far as the leading lady, Major Harvey Stovall [Dean Jagger], serves as that purpose. When you finally see the massive amount of bombs reigning down on the ball bearing factories and other targets in Germany, once again they point out there is no film score music to enhance the scenes, o underline the dramatic scenes, they instead wanted to enhance the stark reality of the massive amounts of bombs being dropped and of course probably lots of civilians were killed in the process. But in dropping the bombs it really crippled Germany in the process of stopping their war effort. As we get to the end of the film, the three commentators say thank you viewing the film with them and hope you also enjoyed watching the film with them and their comments. Well I also agree with their comments on this wonderful Second World War film that ranks up there with other brilliant war films that would be up at the top of the all-time Top Ten best war films ever produced.

Special Feature: Memories of TWELVE OCLOCK HIGH [2007] [480i]  [1.33:1] [29:08] This special feature gets some very interesting talking heads reminiscing about the film's impact on them personally, as well as what the film has meant historically within the broad genre of war films. We find out that Darryl F. Zanuck took eight months to finish the screenplay; also no film studios at the time was initially not very keen or interested in making the film or any of the main stars in the film that was also initially not very interested in appearing in the film. But eventually three scripts were drafted, but Darryl F. Zanuck did a hatched job and eventually whittled it down to one script that even the actors were now very keen to appear in the film. We find out how the film title came about by Sy Bartletts wife. They all highly praise the director Henry King, who originally directed silent films and in this film made all the actors feel very comfortable and that is how he got the best out of all the actors, who really loved working with him. They talk about the actor Dean Jagger who normally appeared in films with a toupee, but was encouraged to appear naturally half bald. They go into great detail about the film locations, which were RAF Barford St. John Air Base, Oxfordshire, England, UK, Eglin Air Force Base, Fort Walton Beach, Florida, USA and Ozark Army Airfield, Ozark, Alabama, USA. Because the combined real combat filmed aerial battle scenes that was done by Darryl F. Zanuck favourite film editor Barbara McClean (16th November, 1903  28th March, 1996) who had 62 credits to her name and because Barbara McClean did a very professional seamless editing job, the whole thing worked very well. As to the composer of the film score, Darryl F. Zanuck was always keen to use Alfred Newman, as he was renowned for his very dramatic film scores, and with the opening of the film created a strong impression for a film of this calibre, but very strange is the fact that the majority of the film did not have a dramatic score, only at certain points in the film where it was needed. But when the film was finally released is was a massive box office hit, especially showing the public what it was like for these bombers in the Second World War, especially with great actors portraying the real men who helped win the war over Germany, and all who participated in this special feature says that the reason the film was a big success is because it is a very serious take on a very serious subject, and a strong aim towards making sure that the details were correct. It was also a very good serious historical record of exactly what occurred during the years where they were trying to as a nation, to set up a strategic bombing programme over Europe, to overcome the might of the German nation and especially Hitler. So all in all this is a very nice little feature, that packs in a lot of information about the making of the film TWELVE OCLOCK HIGH. Contributors include Rudy Behlmer [Film Historian], Allan T.

Special Feature: WWII and the American Home Front [2007] [480i] [1.33:1] [7:32] With this documentary it focuses more on the Americas reaction to being in conflict, with mentions of things like women getting into the workforce in a major way for the first time. We also get an in-depth insight look into the Second World War that had a big impact on the American public and especially when they called it a Good War, for some unknown reason, because there was a lot at stake in defeating the enemy. All the spokesperson says that when they were young was when the Second World War started and were young enough to be called up to be drafted into the armed services, which was a way of life. Even if you were an American student and could not be enlisted, they were still there to help with the war effort or anyone else was able to help the war effort by buying War Bonds and Stamps. Also I was also very surprised to hear that America had rationing like we did in the United Kingdom, and it helped America make an effort for the war effort. What was also good to hear that you get to view lots of old newsreel films of the American troops fighting in Europe. As we come to the end of another very short special feature, someone comments by saying something very prophetic in saying, When these people came home, were they classed as heroes or not, well they were heroes and the greater emotion was not really that they were heroes, but the fact that they were back home. People involved with the war didn't talk about their medals, and it was very true for a lot of the veterans, and heroes do not go round bragging about it.

Special Feature: Inspiring A Character: General Frank A. Armstrong [2007] [480i] [1.33:1] [7:26] This is a template documentary concentrates on the actor Gregory Peck and his character of Brigadier General Frank Savage and he was known for having a reputation for being a straight army and a stickler for discipline and his nickname was Army. But despite this, he actually had a very soft side to his character, but was also very intelligent and was very well respected by his fellow men. When you see Gregory Peck arrive at the base and finds security lacking and no discipline, well this actually happened in real life and the General was really shocked by the lack of respect for discipline and as you see in the film things changed dramatically, especially with the air crew bombers, but because of great losses at the start of the war, the General used his iron rod to make his men more disciplined. We find out that Darryl F. Zanuck paid $100,000 for the film rights and at the time it was considerable amount of money, and was a major film in the eyes of Darryl F. Zanuck who took a personal hands on the film and really threw himself into the film project, and to make it a true film and also a glorious film. Though General Frank A. Armstrong himself may not have wanted to be associated with the Brigadier General Frank Savage character in the film, considering his disposition and the dramatic climax of the film.

Special Feature: The Pilots Of The Eighth Air Force [2007] [480i] [1.33:1] [12:25] As the United States entered World War II, everything we thought we knew turned out to be wrong. We thought we could engage in high altitude strategic bombing runs in the daylight, believing, incorrectly as it turned out, that the B-17 could outfly the enemy's fighter jets. This brief but interesting featurette looks at some of the guys who actually did those daytime bombing runs. We are told that the Americans were ready for the Second World War and had been prepared since 1935, especially at the training camps. The Americans felt England was like a giant aircraft carrier, that was a strategic base to be able to bomb Germany, and the air battles started around 1942, but unfortunately 60 bombers in total were lost in the war effort, which equated to 26,000 men. The guys who were the gunners working in freezing conditions and some got frostbite. We find out that the British who lived round the air basis, after the Second World War restored all of the buildings as museum pieces, and the Eighth Air Force is now much better known in England than back in America. There has been a lot of discussions about the blanket bombing and whether it was a great success or not and the jury is still out on the subject. As we get to the end, one of the older bombe brigade says, This was the fore front of saving Western Civilization, and the defeat of Germany, and I was glad I was there. Contributors include Donald L. Miller [Best-Selling Author of Masters of the Air], Donald Bevan [Member of the 306th Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress Brigade and Co-Author of Stalag 17], Leo Braudy [Film and Cultural Historian] and Allan T. Duffin [Co-Author of The 12 O'Clock High Logbook].  Directed by Jamie Willett. Screenplay by Jamie Willett.

Finally, despite the film being well over 60 years old, TWELVE OCLOCK HIGH [1949] is apparently still required viewing at any U.S. Service Academies and Training schools. Cooperative relationship with the Air Force was crucial; it meant supply of military planes and airfield location.  Contrary to expectation, the military were impressed with the storys serious approach and with mogul Darryl F. Zanucks vision.  Their agreement to help was contingent only on few minor changes in the script. Producer Zanuck, head of Twentieth-Century Fox who initiated the project, believed that the film can serve as tremendous propaganda to stimulate interest in the Air Force.  This production was special to him due to his own service in the War. A critical and commercial success, TWELVE OCLOCK HIGH is one of the first and still a film to accurately portray the experiences of rank-and-file members and their leaders in war, under fire. The film is still used by the military in workshops devoted to transmitting skills of leadership, teambuilding, and interpersonal communication between officers and soldiers. Highly Recommended!

A wonderful portrayal of the severity of those assigned to B-17 crews out of England. Often we get lost in the romanticism of the boys aloft serving mom and those back home, protecting our way of life from the axis of evil. The job was not clamorous nor glorious but blindingly hard and often tormentingly painful, feeezing temperatures and terrifying days far beyond what those men expected. The number of crew losses where staggering but they had to press on. Tough men with even tougher though great leaders with very hard and unpopular decisions to impose on an already exhausted army air corp.

268521,5,6300247090,"My grandfather, Donald Parker, was a medic with the 449th Bomb Group (B24's out of North Africa and then Italy) and he often cited this movie as the most realistic portrayal of operations of a heavy bombardment squadrons put on film, thus it was also his favorite film. I didn't understand when I was younger and he first told me about it. I was 10 or 12, and all I cared about were the combat scenes - a typical kid not understanding the human element of it all of which this mostly revolves around. I listened to his stories, as he spent most of his time at the airfield - as this movie is primarily based - but I didn't quite grasp the significance of it all. He would talk about personal experiences of crews coming back, shaken up, wounded, and sometimes seeing a crew almost make it only to lose it right at the very end.

I joined the Marines after 9/11, saw combat in Iraq as an infantryman, and only then did I start to grasp what he was trying to tell me, and why this film was his favorite. This movie connects on all levels and is absolutely perfect, to especially include the way it reveals - to me - that only latter in life do we remember the significance of what we've endured and those we endured with, as I'm slowly remembering, somberly, the human element of my own service with my friends through the worst of experiences. I can't imagine how this affected my Grandfather as this film was exactly the setting of what he experienced as portrayed.

Aside from my personal connection to the film, it is superbly acted, filmed, and authentic. They crash a real B-17 with the wheels up for crying out loud, and have plenty of real B-17's flying on film - not just stock footage. I don't claim to be an expert on aerial bombardment operational conduct in-flight, but everything feels very realistic regarding communication and coordination. Military bearing and realism in general is excellent as well.

Because of all of this, I now cite this movie as my personal favorite as, above all else, I truly feel I'm seeing an accurate piece of my now late-Grandfather's story that I couldn't grasp years ago. Excellent, excellent film.",1471392000,,2144,4.534883720930233

It does an excellent job telling the story of what war does to those who are pushed to the limit. It shows that no matter how tough, rigid, or structured a person is, if you push them hard enough, they will snap under the stresses of war. This is a must own for any WWII enthusiast! Also, a little insight to the name of the movie.

268528,3,6300247090,"Twelve OClock High, 1949 film

The film begins when a man buys a mug, then bicycles to a cow pasture. A few years earlier this had been a busy US Air Force B-17 bomber airfield. Then we return to the early days of WW II. A damaged B-17 lands roughly with its combat wounded. Spare planes will arrive, and their next mission will be to fly at 9,000 feet to bomb St. Nazaire and its submarine pens. This lower height results in more accuracy and then fewer missions. [Bombers are long-distance artillery.] Some in the group think they have a jinx for bad luck. [Or at the low end of the learning curve?] No plan is perfect, there is always the unexpected. The film shows how good management can handle problems. Daylight precision bombing is the key to winning the war. It is about production, destroying enemy factories results in a loss of supplies and a less effective armed force. The final target was the ball-bearing factories, the critical part for any mechanical armed force.

A new general starts by enforcing the rules. Visitors will be checked, men will be in uniform and on post; no more slacking off. It's a war, maximum effort is required. General Frank Savage challenges his men to perform better. They should stop worrying about dying and accept the fact some men will die; life will be easier. They will perform better when they have pride in themselves. The best defense against enemy fighters is to fly in close formation so each airplane can defend the others. Any bomber that drops out of formation is likely doomed. These new rules result in better morale and good luck. [The result of more training and experience.] Now men want to sneak aboard to take part in these missions.

The last part of the film shows actual battle scenes from both sides, and the casualties. Gunners are told to use short bursts to save ammunition. Their bombs are dropped when they reach their target. One bomber takes a direct hit and explodes in the air. Others are damaged and fall behind. Enemy fighters are shot down. At the end General Savage suffers from burn out, the result of ""maximum effort"". Everyone has a breaking point, man or machine. The ending shows 19 of 21 bombers returning, a heavy 9% loss. [The later use of long-distance fighters like the P-51 reduced losses.]

This drama is unusual in being primarily about the control and management of a military force (a specialized form of business management). Few films made during WW II are now shown on TV since the 1970s. You can compare this to ""A Walk in the Sun"" for its point of view. While ""Frank Savage"" is fictional, there was a reference to ""Kirk May""; that could be the real Curtis LeMay. The Strategic Air Command (STRAC?) of the 1950s was a monument to the Air Force, but also massive inefficiency in preparing for a war that never happened. One fault in this film is its worship of authoritarianism, a Great Leader who can do no wrong. Wasn't this what we were fighting? The peace-time draft did two things: it soaked up men to keep unemployment down, and worked to support American hegemony after the defeat of the Axis powers and the declining colonial powers. It provided brain-washing of a generation to a military point of view. [Lately the anti-gun nuts are claiming a .50 caliber rifle could shoot down a jet airplane. This film shows .50 caliber machine guns firing at slower propeller-driven airplanes and mostly missing. They usually needed the combined fire from many machine guns to damage enemy fighters.]

268615,5,6300247090,"After World War II numerous young men wrote semi auto biographical novels that paralleled their war time experiences.  Some of the authors and / or the novels became iconic.  Some remain lesser known or all but forgotten.  One novel in the latter category is Twelve O'Clock High.  The novel itself is average.  However the novel became the basis for a very great movie.

This movie is a gripping drama concerning a combat unit in crisis.  The unit is represented as having a crisis of commanders.  The original commander is seemingly an extremely decent and noble human being.  His assistant appears to be weak.  Finally a change of command occurs and the story goes on from there.

The movie is similar to the novel, but there are at the same time, substantial changes.  This of course is normal.  The movie cast is excellent.  The acting is superb.

I love novels and generally like books far more than movies.  But there are exceptions.  Having read this novel and then watched the movie, I was able to gain a real appreciation for the art of movie making.",1451174400,,1059,4.668478260869565

268619,5,6300247090,"When it comes to putting men in battle what does it mean to put forward a maximum effort, and where are the bounds of human endurance?  These are the moral dilemmas faced by men in battle and the leaders who must order them to the front.

In this film the battlefield is in the air as units of the United States Army Air Corps arrived in England and embarked on combat missions over occupied Europe in an effort to disable the Nazi war machine.  Those of you familiar with this phase of WWII and the early attempts at taking the battle to Germany via air combat know that casualties were devastatingly high.  Morale was consequently low as airmen realized that the likelihood of them surviving the required number of combat missions was not high.

Gregory Peck;s character does a fantastic job taking on a hard-luck unit that had a particularly dismal combat record.  The narrator was the ground executive officer played most excellently by Dean Jagger (who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar).

This movie is filmed in black and white, but I when I watch I don't even notice the lack of  color.

The movie includes scenes filmed in studios and war footage shot during actual bombing missions that add to the authenticity of the experience.

This is IMO one of the very best war movies ever made.

268665,5,6300247090,"This movie not only depicts the bravery and sacrifice of WWII airmen, it also shows different management styles in the face of grave danger. Lt. Col. Davenport, loved and respected by his men, lost his effectiveness as a leader when he became so preoccupied with his group's high fatality rate that he no longer could inspire the performance and courage needed to effectively continue the missions. Gen. Savage then takes over command and rebuilt discipline, confidence and courage - though not without first encountering rocky times due to pilot resentment.

Discipline first, choosing the right people, training, leading by example, not seeking popularity, and creating a sense of purpose were used by Savage to turn the group from last place performance to first-place. Meanwhile, some of those not normally directly involved in the raids sneak aboard raids to be closer to the effort.

Eventually, Gen. Savage succumbs to the same problem as the man he replaced - becoming too close to and concerned about his fliers.",1446768000,,1021,5.144578313253012

a figure 8 formation for bomb drop. Problem:
all were given same altitude, which meant head

269095,5,6300247090,"TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH is an emotional and physiologically charged film looking at the devastating effects of command and the effects of war. In some ways this is the greatest WWII film ever made. Several years ago I worked with a WWII veteran who was in the the Big Red One 1st Infantry division. He was there from Casablanca to a Death camp they liberated in Czechoslovakia. We had many discussions during coffee break and lunch break. I once asked him if there was any film made that took place during WWII that he thought came close to depicting what it was like to be there. I was surprised when he told me that TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH was the best. He simply said that it depicted what it was like. He thought this was a very good film. I was always surprised that a guy in the infantry would pick this as the best WWII film. I have watched it many times and I think I understand what he saw. The opening of the film has always haunted me. It is just so moving gives you a feeling of wanting that is so hard to explain. This film is so captivating and so interesting as it unfolds. Gregory Peck's General Frank Savage sees things in what appears to be from an objective standpoint. He relieves Gary Merrill's Colonel Keith Davenport from his command of his tired and worn bomber group because Peck feels Merrill is near the breaking point of his wits and good reason and being too close to his men. Peck takes over command of the group. Peck's objectivity lacks a key emotional content in his sole purpose to command with detached intellect and get the job done. In time Peck finds that a camaraderie has developed with the group who initially resented Merrill's relief of command. In time Peck finds himself in a similar state that he found originally found Gary Merrill and so it goes. Dean Jagger as Major Harvey Stovall is pivotal for Peck's gradual success, and the group's as well, when he first takes command of the group using red tape to hold up communications and give Peck the time he needs to settle in. Dean Jagger's performance is so pivotal in the film and the way the film opens and closes in the post-war era and is actually Jagger's flashback of events remembered with a certain reverence and fervency that is just so telling on the emotional and psychological effects of war, command and much more. Henry King's direction is simply brilliant and heartfelt as is the screenplay. This is probably the best WWII film ever made.",1424736000,,2442,4.514672686230249

The opening of the film has always haunted me. It is just so moving gives you a feeling of wanting that is so hard to explain. This film is so captivating and so interesting as it unfolds.  Gregory Peck's General Frank Savage sees things in what appears to be from an objective standpoint. He relieves Gary Merrill's Colonel Keith Davenport from his command of his tired and worn bomber group because Peck feels Merrill is near the breaking point of his wits and good reason and being too close to his men. Peck takes over command of the group. Peck's objectivity lacks a key emotional content in his sole purpose to command with detached intellect and get the job done. In time Peck finds that a camaraderie has developed with the group who initially resented Merrill's relief of command. In time Peck finds himself in a similar state that he found originally found Gary Merrill and so it goes. Dean Jagger as Major Harvey Stovall is pivotal for Peck's gradual success, and the group's as well, when he first takes command of the group using red tape to hold up communications and give Peck the time he needs to settle in. Dean Jagger's performance is so pivotal in the film and the way the film opens and closes in the post-war era and is actually Jagger's flashback of events remembered with a certain reverence and fervency that is just so telling on the emotional and psychological effects of war, command and much more. Henry King's direction is simply brilliant and heartfelt as is the screenplay. This is probably the best WWII film ever made. The impressive cast included Kenneth Tobey, Hugh Marlowe, Millard Mitchell, Robert Arthur, Paul Stewart, John Kellogg, Lawrence Dobkin and Paul Picerni.",1424649600,7,2597,4.594827586206897

I saw some of these same mannerisms in other WWII vets ,who served in the AAF during the War . Peck's speech in front of the group advising them "" not to make plans , and consider yourself already dead "" was a reflection of  a harsh reality that  many of the flyers lived by.

The movie is not really about bombing, or flying, although there is a fair amount of that in the movie including some actual footage shot during the war of real air combat.

It is actually about the personal cost to the commander of the unit as he sends his men up every day to be killed and wounded.

There are bits and pieces of the movie that seem a bit sappy to me, but overall the movie does a fine job of putting its message across, and lets the viewer do his own thinking about it.

The interplay between the general and his men, and among the men is done well. The tough love aspect of the movie is not something you see these days all that often.",1401494400,2,754,4.1438356164383565

269757,5,6300247090,"My grandfather was a B-17 pilot during WWII, so that's where my interest in movies like this come from. Most of you will not believe it, but my Grandfather was flying many of the planes that were in several scenes of this movie (he even sat next to Peck in one of the flight scenes.)

The film revolves around a bomb group stationed in England during the war that suffers enormous casualties. It deals with the problems the leaders of the outfit face in trying to turn this ""hard luck"" group into a flying, fighting group of men.

Anyway, the movie itself was excellent. My father showed it to me when I was maybe fourteen or fifteen, and it was somewhat boring to me. But now that I'm almost 20, I have really grown to appreciate this movie. It really demonstrates what true leadership is and how a good military officer conducts himself. It's too bad more officers today aren't like ""General Frank Savage"". It seems the liberal element of society is hellbent on destroying what is left of true discipline in our modern military because it might ""hurt someone's feelings"".

It's a movie about making hard decisions, sending young boys to die, but having no choice.  It's about trying to hang on to humanity when you can't afford to.

269949,5,6300247090,"This is an extremely powerful, intelligent and BRILLIANT war film! Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

USAAF air base Archbury in United Kingdom, autumn 1942. The 918th Bomb Group of USAAF, operating the B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers, one of the first American units to attack targets in Nazi-occupied Europe from British bases, attracts attention of allied high command for its repeated bad performances and especially very high losses. It is now known as ""Bad Luck 918"" and morale in it is low, even if its commanding officer, Colonel Davenport, is known for his courage under fire and also for the attention given to his men welfare. He is therefore still popular with his men. But the high command decides to sack him and replace him with Brigadier-General Frank Savage - a somehow extraordinary appointment, considering that Bomb Groups were usually not commanded by generals.

Savage (Gregory Peck) is a young and extremely vigorous general - he also quickly proves to be absolutely ruthless in restoring discipline and squeezing from his men everything they can give! He quickly becomes object of intense hatred and things will ultimately go very, very far between him and the men under his command... That takes care of about first eight minutes of the film, and I will say no more here.

The great quality of this particularly brilliant film, which got two Oscars in 1949, is due in large part to the men who wrote the novel ""Twelve O'Clock High"" published in 1948 and immediately adapted to the screen.

Ukrainian-Jewish immigrant Sy Bartlett (he was born Sacha Baraniev in Ukraine in 1901), was first a journalist before becoming a screenplay writer in the 30s. During war he served as Intelligene Officer in USAAF in Europe and could therefore observe well the functionning of real Bomb Groups. Colonel Beirne Lay Jr. served during WWII in USAAF and actualy commanded a Bomb Group, the 487th, leading it into numerous missions over Germany (albeit the 487th operated the B-24 Liberators, rather than the B-17 Flying Fortress). Their co-operation produced an excellent book - and when they were also asked to adapt ""Twelve O'Clock High"" into a scenario, they did again an excellent job.

Actors did an amazing job in this film, beginning of course with Gregory Peck, for whom it was one of the most brilliant performances EVER! It is simply incredible how tough is his character and when a really bad@ss general is played by such a young, handsome and charismatic person the effect is particularly strong! Believe me, it is not for nothing that his character is named ""Savage""...)))

The names of other actors are not instantly recognizable today anymore, as most of them were specialists of second roles - and it was fitting, because this film is first and above anything else a performance by Gregory Peck, who offers here a brilliant study about a lot of things but especially about the bittersweet taste of great power and about the unavoidable and necessary solitude of the man on the top...

IMPORTANT DETAIL! This is a war film WITHOUT fighting scenes, as everything happens on the USAAF bases - but believe me, you will not even notice this little detail! Also, it is a long film - 132 minutes - but once again, you will not even notice the time passing!

SECOND IMPORTANT DETAIL! The title ""Twelve O'Clock High"" is in principle the code word the crews of allied bombers used to signal enemy fighters attacking frontally and from above - this was considered the deadliest way to attack a heavily armed formation of heavy bombers and therefore those words, when heard on the interphone, were heavily packed with menace... However, this title means also A LOT OF OTHER THINGS - once you finished watching this film, take a minute to consider other possible meanings... This reflection is actually another reason why I consider this film as such a major masterpiece!

CONCLUSION: an incredible war film, without one weak scene, mostly VERY tough and brutal, but also with some discreet humor here and there. A thing to buy, watch, keep and re-watch! ENJOY!",1379894400,3,4093,4.920289855072464
269950,4,6300247090,"The movie's time frame, setting and plot are all similar to Command Decision, another fine wartime drama about air combat. But this one features a different cast and much more action. Gregory Peck plays Brigadier Gen. Frank Savage, who is given a critical task. In 1942 in England, early in World War II, he must restore the effectiveness and morale of the men of the 918th bomber group while replacing their beloved commander, Gen. Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill). The way he does so is tremendously difficult for both him and his men, but given what's at stake - possibly the outcome of the war - you can see that he has no choice. This movie was cited most often by members of the U.S. 8th Air Force as the most accurate representation of their lives and missions dramatized on film. Written by Beirne Lay, Jr. and Sy Bartlett from their novel, it is an intelligent, highly thoughtful portrayal of the stresses of command in wartime, and it's a tribute to the quiet but amazing heroism of the men who flew bombing missions against Germany. The 12-minute combat sequence featuring B-17 bombers against Messerschmitt and Focke-Wulf fighters is incredibly harrowing and more realistic than anything else on film - because it is real battle footage. Dean Jagger won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Peck's top aide, and Peck himself is terrific, as are Millard Mitchell as the Air Force commander in England, and Hugh Marlowe (in possibly his best role) as a trouble-plagued pilot.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",1378944000,3,1748,5.5018587360594795

Gregory Peck is superb as General Frank Savage who relieves his burnt out best friend Col. Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill) and takes command of a bomber wing in England during WWII. Each mission produces staggering losses. Only our submariners had a higher fatality rate percentage wise. This movie is very special. And the TV series starring Robert Lansing wasn't bad either.

270280,4,6300247090,"This 1949 film focuses on combat fatigue experienced by combat crews of the 8th Army Air Force. Gregory Peck portrays General Savage, a man that falls victim to his own hard and disciplined professionalism.

To fully appreciate the scale of stress and fatigue experienced by these B-17 bomber crewmen, I recommend the DVD ""WWII in HD - The Air War), sold by amazon. Perhaps in 1949, less was better and there was not much need to repeat the terror of the air war.

To view this film from the present, the stress and fatigue is there as told, but not shown, as it would have to be had the film been made today.

The two disc set includes features about the making of ""12 O'clock High"", the actual B-17s used in the film, together with the actual 'crash' scene piloted by Paul Mantz.

On average, the loss rate of such raids was around 15%, on some raids, Schwienfurt for example, the loss rate was significantly higher, about 30%  It doesn't take long for the mathematics re German AA guns and fighters for an airman to figure his hegative odds of surving over a long campaign.  One of the most poignant scenes I've ever seen is the opening of this film--beauifully done, empathetic, and cogent: it sets the tone for this magnificient kinetic-visual narrative.  Beautiful are those amazing B-17 (real airplanes not computer generated) we see flying again.  If you have interest in this topic, may I suggest that you view William Wyler's Academy-Award wining film, ""The Memphis Bell.""

It's a movie for a maturer audience with great depth and focuses on the stress of command and the fact that everyone (even those in 'command') have somebody above them to report to and who puts pressure on them. ""You gotta serves somebody"" as Bob Dylan sang. Gregory Peck is superb and very convincing and the acting is of its time - a little bit wooden in places but good.

The story itself is attempting to use precision daylight bombing in Germany to reach the submarine pens. Many of the actors went on later in life to become stars on their own.

I cannot believe that I have never seen it up until now.

Unfortunately, the quality of the video is poor in many places.  While some scenes are up to DVD quality, many others are faded or grainy.  The source material was obviously not restored or digitally remastered, which is a shame.  I was hoping that it would resemble the Blu-ray version of Casablanca in appearance, but it looks more like the old DVD version of All Quiet on the Western Front.

No bad language. No gore, no violence...not like you would see in a ""modern"" movie.  Instead, you hear about what happened, and it is left to your own imagination.

This is not a dogfight plane movie with lots of in-air action.  There is some of that, but most of the action takes place back at the base.

So, if you're looking for a shoot 'em up movie, this is not it.  What you will get is enough action to keep it moving, and the rest is drama and excellent acting.  Yes, there is definitely a psychological part to war, and this movie presents that very well.

Clarity can come and go as well. IN other words; while there is little dirt and obvious deep scratches ,no effort was made to restore this movie. Which is a shame. Fox did a incredible job on 'tora tora tora' but they just dropped the ball here. I don't see why either. This is black and white and it would have been easier to restore.  Still compared to terrible dvd version this is a improvement. So you can't help but feel some disapointment from this blu ray. Why not restore it?

This film dared to go where few movies did in its era or since. It is a brilliant profile that examines the strains and complexities of command and the stresses that the airmen faced in war. The movie being filmed in B/W is a plus because it conveys such an immense sense of mood.

Twelve O' Clock High is the epitome of all the necessary elements needed to create a truly outstanding film. Gregory Peck is at his best and one would be hard pressed to find a finer supporting cast that was ever assembled for a film. Added to this an outstanding script, direction, and atmosphere.

The combat footage is not the best as it falls into the trap so many other films have of using fighter guncamera footage to show supposed kills by the bombers.  But combat is not the major thurst of this film.  Rather the film is a study in the efforts it takes to make brave men face almost insurmountable challanges with a willingness to give all that it takes to do the job,1299542400,,461,4.287356321839081
270534,5,6300247090,"I picked up this movie fromt he library.  Always fascinated by the pilots during WWII, I choice to see this film that shows fighter's spirit during WWII air battles in Europe.  I was fascinated by the all male performances led by Gregory Peck.  Actors depicted life and turmoil of living on the military airbase, going into combat during day air raides, bonds that man formed between each other and their leaders.  It was also remarkable that director used real pictures from both American and German sides that depicted some of the bombings and real air battles.

This film is a story about leadership and what it means, about limitations between personal friendhips during the war times andneed to have unbiased hold over soldiers exposed to stress that can push them towards action, emotional hardship but also sense of patriotism and national pride.  It is a kid of movie that deserves to be classic and should be shown to young generations so they can learn about meaning of war battles and meaning of bond between soldiers.",1298332800,,1029,4.851428571428571

I really enjoyed the movie then and didn't get a chance to see again until recently when I purchased it. So it might have some Hollywood stuff in it, but when it came out in 1949--I'm sure a lot of veterans played a role in making sure we understood how difficult a mission they had. This movie is action packed and reflective of some of the challenges some of our military leaders faced then and today. It strongly re-enforces what it takes (and what it took) to be leader, the lives that were lost during WWII, the commitment/sacrifice that members of the armed forces then/now made to allow everyone to enjoy the freedoms we have today.",1289952000,,815,4.627586206896551
270587,5,6300247090,"It may be somewhat superfluous to review this fine film, given the many reviews already available and the plaudits almost universally awarded, but repeated viewings only serve to remind one of just how much this film can render an understanding of bravery, loyalty, leadership and service. It is a film that almost demands that one tell other people about it and the pleasure and insight that one can derive from the experience. Set in 1942 and accounting the trials of an American B-17 bomber group stationed in England, it portrays the efforts and the strategies of the commander, General Savage (Gregory Peck), to re-create the morale of the crews and reestablish its effectiveness. For some inexplicable reason the film does not figure in a recent collection of the ""Top 100 War films""! The planes and crews are engaged in the strategic bomber offensive against Germany. There is no moralising about the horrors of what happened on the ground in Europe during those bomber raids. The ethical concerns and recriminations that attended these events were only beginning to emerge in public discourse at the time the film was made and these issues are addressed extensively up to recent times (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Among-The-Dead-Cities-The-History-and-Moral-Legacy-of-the-WWII-Bombing-of-Civilians-in-Germany-and-Japan/dp/0802715656/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Among The Dead Cities: The History and Moral Legacy of the WWII Bombing of Civilians in Germany and Japan</a>(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bombing-Civilians-A-Twentieth-Century-History-New-Press-The-film-is-about-command-and-leadership-the-loneliness-of-that-command-and-the-effects-that-that-can-have-on-the-individual-The-impact-of-the-stress-upon-Savage-not-only-from-the-constant-e/dp/1595585478/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bombing Civilians: A Twentieth-Century History (New Press).

This film reportedly is used in numerous seminars, workshops and training institutions to depict leadership styles and strategies. While it can certainly show how leadership (not management) can elicit and guide efficaceous behaviour, it also demonstrates the damage on the person who fulfils that role too well and effectively. The film also shows the group dynamics, the conflicts and the gradual emergence of a ""group consciousness"" to energise and to guide effective behaviour. So it is a training manual for group behaviour and the development of social identity (to put into modern jargon). But no seminar or university lecture can do as effective a job as a single viewing of this film.
Everyone in the film is quite brilliant, especially Peck who surely should have got an Academy Award  for his role (although in 1949 he was up against pretty formidable competition) and Dean Jagger did get the best supportive award. But the ensemble is what makes the film, just as a bomber group is composed of all its members. The director (Henry King) made many fine films before and after, but it is difficult to imagine how this one could be surpassed for story and impact.",1288483200,,3312,6.184381778741866

Only 3 B-17s were involved in the movie (most of the ones seen in the movie were actual WWII Army Signal Corps films, along with German and American gun camera shots).  Different names and ID numbers/letters were painted on the 3 B-17s to make it appear that there was an entire B-17 group involved. Gregory Peck and Dean Jagger did an excellent job in their roles.

270618,5,6300247090,"This popular academy award winning movie is used in leadership training seminars to demonstrate leadership style and teamwork. It presents a genuine parallel between effective and ineffective leadership. The 918th, a WWII B-17 bomber squadron, under the leadership of General Savage, grew from a fearful, unskilled group with numerous casualties to a confident, highly skilled group with much fewer casualties. The vivid contrast in leadership styles between General Savage and Colonel Davenport dramatically affect the performance of the squadron.  This is the significant message of the film.  General Davenport, outwardly caring greatly for his men, is reluctant to keep sending them on bombing missions because of high casualties and the extremely low morale.  General Davenport, high on the relationship scale, is so concerned with the welfare of his men that he is underleading them i.e. having low expectations and poor training. He is not matching the necessary leadership style to their readiness level of the group. They were low in ability and motivation. General Savage, low on the relationship scale, took command and immediately raised expections and training.  Morale increased and so did effectiveness. General Savage's style matched the readiness of the group.  He was demanding and authoritative. He insisted on developing training skills.  He was ""hands on"" and actually went on missions with his men.  This movie is also a study of over leadership. It clearly illuminates the consequences of not knowing when it is necessary to move from an strong authoritarian style to a coaching or counseling style once readiness levels improve.

A slow, plodding, and overlong war movie, Twelve O'Clock High has acquired a baffling reputation as a classic when in fact it's composed of 120 minutes of tedium and 10 minutes of archive war footage that's poorly shoehorned into the film; though the movie should perhaps be praised for looking into the psychological side of fighting, that doesn't make it any less dull to watch.",1234051200,4,398,4.852941176470588
270677,4,6300247090,"A review of the Special Edition of Twelve O-clock High must be in two parts: the movie itself and the so-called extras that are supplied (thus giving the package its name and a higher cost [and sometime value]).

The movie is a discourse on the impact of the stress of command on individuals. Set against the very early period of the US high-level, daylight bombing of Nazi occupied Europe, the 918th Bombardment Group - Heavy is the weak sister in the fledgling 8th Air Force. It is the unit that looses the most crews, has the poorest bombing record, and the lowest morale.

The movie opens with a chaotic return from a mission that went wrong from the onset and stayed that way to the end. When alerted for a mission the very next day, the group commander, Keith Davenport, goes to higher headquarters to complain. This action sets in motion the belief on the part of General Frank Savage that the problem lies in Davenport's hands for failing to manage the group such that pride and competence are imbued.

The 8th Air Force commander agrees with Savage's assessment and relieves Davenport. He then sends Savage - a former group commander who was promoted to headquarters - to the 918th to straighten it out. Savage does this via the notional ""kickin' butts and taking names,"" and the group evolves into a successful team. The cost for doing this - beyond the horrendous loss of life that would have occurred one way or the other in wartime - is the mental collapse of Savage.

For those seeking a ""shoot `em up war movie, you've come to the wrong place. This excellent film is a study in management and inter-personal relationships that is a mirror of not just the military, but also of business. Throughout it, individuals are placed in positions requiring strength of character and commitment. Some fail and some succeed; others do both and find redemption.

As movie, I rate it as a five star.

The extras are decidedly at the other end of the spectrum. A series of interviews with historians are interspersed with footage from the film offer some insight into the characters and events depicted, while offering virtually nothing about the making of the film or the context of the events.

The extras rate a single star at best.

270685,5,6300247090,"This is a powerful movie that emphasizes the difficulties of military leadership and the pressures on airman who have comfortable beds and means in England and have to fly into death and terror days on end.  While there are some powerful air battle scenes in the movie, most of it takes place in officer's quarters and on the airbase in England.

I think Gregory Peck gives one of his best performances as General Savage.  He is an officer who cares for his men, but cannot show it.  He pushes his mean to keep them safe and flies with them more than he should.  Eventually, despite putting on the exterior of the fearless, motivated airman and the kind of tough leader he believes his men need, the emotions he has repressed manifest themselves in a rather shocking way.

The men under him have their own struggles with wanting to serve, but realizing all the friends they have lost in order to drop bombs on things that don't really do much to change the war.  They want out of the air service, particularly out from under Savage; yet they fly.

Dean Jagger is spectacular as Major Stovall and won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for this role in 1949.  The rest of the cast is very good and the movie holds up well some sixty years on.

Very much worth seeing, but more of a thinking movie than an action film.

I have seen Savage's method of leadership examined in business school for its strengths and weaknesses. Quite an interesting exercise.

270770,5,6300247090,"In comparing ""Saving Private Ryan"" to ""Twelve O'Clock High"", a previous reviewer made a very strong case for ""Twelve O'Clock High"" being the better film. I agree 110%. Both were nominated for Best Picture and both lost, but ""Twelve O'Clock High"" is by far the better of the two if only because director Henry King didn't put his ego on display to ruin things. ""Ryan"",of course, won El Speilbergo a Best Director statue in honor of the most obvious, I WANT THAT AWARD!! ""front loading"" of a film in the history of motion pictures. ""Twelve O'Clock High"" features only one combat scene and that comes near the end of the film. Up until then you have great actors in a great film about tough decisions and how they need to be made in times of war. Gregory Peck takes over a ""hard luck"" bomber wing, makes some unpopular changes and whips the men into a winning team. My review makes it all sound so cliche', but please don't let that fool you. When it comes to the relationships between the characters, it's very much on a par with ""The Best Years of Our Lives"". It's such a great film about war that it doesn't even matter that there's just that one brilliant battle scene near the end where it belongs. Sure, Henry King could have ""front loaded"" the picture with lots of bombs and flying bullets to hook the audience from the get go, but he did what was best for the film. In my opinion, ""Twelve O'Clock High"" is one of the best WWII movies ever made because it focuses on the men and their fragile states of mind. It focuses on the all too real effects of war on the men rather than to showcase the war itself. It also benefits from the fact that it was made only four years after the war ended. There's just no substitute for the film having been produced while WWII was still fresh in everyone's mind. All the money in Hollywood couldn't buy that kind of authenticity today. So El Speilbergo spent most of his budget on that overblown frontloading of ""Ryan"" and snagged an Oscar in the process, while Henry King simply placed his masterful action scene where it worked best for the movie. Anyway, if you ask me, Henry King didn't do so badly after all. He didn't win an Oscar, but Dean Jagger did, which is one more than any actor in ""Ryan"" won. If Speilberg had really deserved that ""Best Director"" Oscar, then at least one of his actors should have won an Oscar too. So if you haven't yet seen ""Twelve O'Clock High"", buy it, borrow it or rent it. I've seen it no less than a dozen times and it's aways a pleasure to behold.

270771,5,6300247090,"From 9,000 feet, the daytime air raids against Germany seemed hopeless and unending. The unspoken goal: fly 25 missions with all limbs in tact and you've done your duty. One mission arrested my attention in the middle of this remarkable movie.  General Frank Savage (Gregory Peck) announces a strategic target: the ball bearing factory.  Bomb just one factory (Germany's sole ball bearing supplier) and you'll disrupt assembly lines throughout the country. Brilliant!

That's a great lesson for companies and organizations. What's your strategic target?  Is there one big bold action or one fork-in-the-road target that will change the battle for you?  Often, it's not just one thing--but many factors, but maybe it's time to think outside the plane--get up higher and evaluate where you're dropping your bombs. It's not the number of bombs you drop, it's the targets that you hit.

Note to leaders and managers: order popcorn and soft drinks and plan a ""Staff Meeting at the Movies"" afternoon event.  The film showcases a phenomenal study in leadership and team building--with two distinct leadership styles in play.  It's often used in MBA courses (Harvard, etc.).

By the way, last month I heard John Maxwell speak on servant leadership and Jesus' model of washing the disciples' feet. He said ""the secure are into towels, and the insecure are into titles.""  Think about that if you screen this movie with your team.",1189987200,,1419,5.103896103896104

This is a WWII timepiece set and delivered in the appropriate B&W format to faciliate the time travel of the audience to another time and another place. The film opens with a very sentimental scene by Dean Jagger when he revisits the old airfield after the war. From there everything flashes back. The entire entry for Frank Savage (Gregory Peck) is well set up. What emerges immediately is a depiction of the stress involved with life and death decision-making.

It's very symbolic and ironic that Peck (as Savage) is involved in the decision that places Savage in the stress pressure cooker of the leadership of a B-17 squadron. Even the best of leaders will not always speak up to replace a friend and the enter the same position that they leveled criticism against.

Changing attitudes, improving tactics and training, etc., is met with challenges and resistance by many who were loyal to the previous leadership. Peck is very convincing in this role as a straight talking goal oriented leader.

stress of command that the previous leader endured. This is a very good depiction of life in combat and what it does to the entire unit. This film is a good experience for anyone who wants to be a leader in any field.",1174348800,5,1369,4.7154811715481175

Keith Davenport who was relieved of his command for getting too attached to his men.  And although Savage tries to distance himself from his men, the emotional strain begins to take its toll.

The deadly missions over German held territory and men trying to remain strong during a time of extreme danger soon transfers sadness to the movie viewer himself. Very few bomber crews ever survived the twenty-five missions required to rotate home. And please don't get attached to any one character in the movie for they may not be there after the next mission

270912,5,6300247090,"If there is one war story to keep on your shelf besides ""Saving Private Ryan,"" this is it.

It starts with a lawyer visiting England as a tourist years after war's end. He discovers a cheap, ceramic antique which the store owner tells him is of little value. ""Value?"" replies the lawyer. ""Wrap it very carefully"" he adds. So begins his mental journey back in time to the English airstrip where he served as adjutant of the 918th (nine, eighteenth) Bomb Group.

This ""hard luck"" group is taken over by a brigadier general from a colonel who has ""over-identified"" with his men, thus putting them before his missions. The general, Frank Savage, must restore group discipline and performance before the group disintegrates as an effective fighting unit.

General Savage puts mission before men and turns the disgruntled men who despise him into a cohesive unit. They turn into a group that will do anything to keep from being left behind, or letting down their new leader. (Each announcement of a mission for the following day is characterized by the operations officer going to the mantel over the fireplace, in the Officers' Club, and turning the head of a ceramic pirate face outward.)

But the tough general will not make the same mistake that the last group commander makes. He will always keep the mission first, and will not over-identify with his men. He will not let the loss of his men affect him.

Or, will he?

This black & white story is exceptional and superbly acted. It shows the mental tug-of-war a leader must make in the decisions that will cost the lives of men he has come to admire and respect. It depicts how the ugliness of war brings out the best in ourselves, and creates fraternal bonds that last a lifetime.

This is not a gory story, but it is one that will leave you breathless. It may sadden you, but it will not disappoint you. It does not end with everyone living, or happy.

War never does.

270913,4,6300247090,"Hollywood comes through.  Perhaps no film in history better glorifies commitment to an abstraction - in this case, low altitude bombing of industrial sites staffed largely by women and children - and its effects on command. (The claim of ""precision"" bombing was as ludicous then as it is now.) The film was, and may still be, shown in IBM's senior managment schools, and its effects are startling: it inspires men to become tough heroes and women to become men.

I don't doubt for a second that every human being, at one time or another, has summoned the courage to solve a dillema at the price of great anxiety: living on after burying a child, facing surgery, divorce, you name it.  Humans don't lack courage; we all have it.  Ironically, the film is not about courage.  (No film can adequately show the terror of combat.) Instead, it is a heavy dose of propaganda, fit for a country that thrives on war - and propaganda.  Its aim is to create the perfect metaphor for leadership.

Although military command is not synonymous with leadership, the film meets its objectives brilliantly.  Its take-away is inspiring to anyone who ever pulled off the perfect church supper, organized a field trip, raised money for a cause, led the development of a software system.

Twelve O'Clock High shows those in charge at their most agressive (for fund-raisers, making that last of a thousand phone calls in the middle of the night); it assures us that nothing short of pugnacity is required for successful leadership; and then it insightfully directs our sympathies toward those upon whose shoulders such responsibility falls.

When you think of excellent classic World War II dramas you have to consider the English made ""Sink the Bismarck"" which is well crafted and this American made story of bombers flying out of England. There are two stand out performances by Gregory Peck as Brig. Gen. Frank Savage and Dean Jagger as Maj. Harvey Stovall. The rest of the cast is very good and carry off their parts well, but Peck and Jagger are the movie. Their conversations and Jagger's narration through the movie as he reflects back on what happened after the war while visiting the old haunts is as good as it gets in this kind of drama. This is typically in most peoples top ten of WWII movies. Black and White movies may not appeal to some but the contrast can sometimes give an interesting perspective and add to the mood and give it a historical feel. The action is fairly intense sometimes because they used actual aerial war footage and the radio chatter although probably taped is realistic. Many of those that flew in B-17s themselves said this was a good depiction of what it really was like.

270958,5,6300247090,"I give high marks to the script of ""12 O'clock High"". This B&W film made in 1949 explores with compassion the psychological  breaking point of the pilots in Squadron 918, one of the first American outfits to conduct daylight bombing raids over occupied Europe and Nazi Germany. I suppose if it were re-made today, this wonderful script would be diluted in favour of more action scenes.

Of course, the film has that too. Actual aerial footage from the archives of the German Luftwaffe and American Army Air Corp are woven into the film. The B-24s and Luftwaffe fighters obviously add raw energy, but they do not overshadow the story of how the battles, the deaths affected the morale of the men.

Gregory Peck and Dean Jagger portray this to great effect. In fact, had they delivered less than convincing performances, ""12 O'clock High's"" story of these brave airman would probably have been relegated to some dusty back shelf. By the way, if it's actors you're interested in, look closely; there's a young Robert Stack (who later played Elliot Ness in the TV series ""The Untouchables"") as one of the pilots.

All in all, ""12 O'clock High"" is a fine document of the early involvement of American airman operating in the European theatre of WWII. It shows how the toughest of leaders could break. Yet, in spite of this, he could inspire courage and inculcate duty in his men to fulfil their mission should he himself falter.

270962,5,6300247090,"This is just an excellent, quality movie with an all star cast of Peck, Gary Merrill, Hugh Marlowe, and of course Dean Jaegger on whose recollections the film is constructed. The incredible pressure on these bomber pilots flying oh so slowly over hazardous terrain and against enemy fighters that would close three, four, five, even six times as fast must have been truly frightening. I used to think they were giants in the air watching the old Air Power series as a kid. 20 years ago my Dad and I were in Henden in England at the Royal Air Museum. One was on display and you could walk on a scaffold around it. IT WAS ONLY A LITTLE MORE THAN 70 FEET LONG. Home to 1st was longer!

In a manner of speaking, 12 O'Clock High is like the old Basil Rathbone, David Niven and Errol Flynn ""Dawn Patrol,"" in which Commanding Officer Basil Rathbone wreaks his haunting revenge on Errol Flynn - by making him the CO.

General Frank Savage, already having flown his missions over Occupied Europe, the equivalent of 'making his bones' in mobster's parlance, is asked to step back down and lead the 8th Air Force's 918th Bombardment Group into the fray. Again. The Group seems to have lost its esprit, its purpose, in a way, its courage. And Savage is no easy skipper. He tells the pilots to tighten the formation up . . . ""no, tighter . . . I want his wings in your ribs!"" And it pays off.

But there's really more to it than that. It's the last line Frederich March utters in ""The Bridges of To Ko Ri,"" 'where do we get such men?'

But just one point. 12 O'Clock is a great movie about the most complex emotion human beings can undergo. It's so complicated that we've forgotten about the human factors in the last two wars America fought, Korea and Vietnam. We don't have to knock other movies to arrive at that conclusion. Some are good, the aforementioned ToKoRi for example. Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. Alec Guiness and William Holden in River Kwai. And certainly Spielberg's Private Ryan. 12 O'Clock High is great.

Gregory Peck plays General Savage and his name indicated his temperament.

271009,3,6300247090,"12 O'Clock High may be considered a masterpiece, but I find the character of Brig. Gen. Frank Savage (Gregory Peck) repellant to the point of loathsomeness, which for me undermines this otherwise well-made production.

Consider: Col. Keith Davenport (well-played by Gary Merrill) the commanding officer of a weary and battle-fatigued unit is removed from his command by Savage, who had been Davenport's friend. What did Davenport do wrong? In Savage's words: ""He's a first rate guy who over-identifies with his men."" As played by Gregory Peck, Savage is the most authoritarian martinet this side of Capt. Queeg. Unsurprisingly, every airman puts in for a transfer out of his unit. Aware that this will make him look bad to his superiors, Savage conspires with his desk jockey ground officer Maj. Harry Stovall (Dean Jagger) to delay the transfers while he works to improve the unit's performance, and in doing so build cohesion and morale. When the Inspector General arrives, Savage is cleaning off his desk, sure that he will lose his command and be sent back to the Pentagon. But instead every man has cancelled his transfer request and Savage stays. I found this situation highly improbable, considering that Savage had 1) relieved the popular Davenport of his command, 2) closed the Officer's club, 3) busted several of the airmen down a couple of ranks and 4) told them in a ""pep"" talk that they should think of themselves as dead men. I think it would be far more likely that they would have transferred out of the unit to get far, far away from that neurotic mess of a general and that Savage would have been transferred to Washington. But no, the 918th goes on to become a crack unit. Cohesion is restored and all is well, or is it?  Late in the film Savage breaks down and is unable to complete a flight mission.  This is a moment of high drama, the tough-as-nails general rendered helpless, but by this time I had no sympathy for this very unsympathetic character.

Perhaps it was because there is no attempt to show that Savage has any feelings.  There is no romantic interest and women do not appear in the film at all, except as nurses and canteen workers.  When the formerly sad sack unit completes a bombing mission, Savage brushes off a suggestion that he should give the men a weekend pass to London as a reward.  ""What?"" he says.  ""And buy their loyalty?""  Efforts by Maj. ""Doc"" Kaiser (Paul Stewart) and Col. Davenport to get Savage to lighten up are similarly ignored.

Dean Jagger does a good turn as Maj. Harry Stovall.  The framing sequence at the beginning and end of the film that takes place after the war is effectively handled.  Well scored, with actual battle sequences filmed during WW II, this is a classic war film that ranks among the greats, but one that I found somewhat cold at the heart.",1123459200,4,2824,4.717479674796748

271013,5,6300247090,"Brig. Gen. Frank Savage (Gregory Peck) takes over the faltering 918th Bomber Group from Col. Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill) when the hard-luck group threatens to fall apart.  Or is it really a hard-luck group?  TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH is a movie about leadership, first and foremost, and also the limits of endurance.  At issue is the viability of daylight precision bombing, a fighting tactic that demands tight formations and low altitude attacks.  It's `our one hope of shortening this war,"" Maj. Gen. Ben Pritchard (Millard Mitchell) tells Savage at one point, and the 918th are spearheading the test.  And they're falling apart.  Col. Davenport is relieved of command and replaced by Savage.  His failing was an over-identification with his men, propping them up when he should have been testing them to seen when a man reaches his breaking point, when they've taken all they could.  Enter Gen. Frank Savage. If Davenport is a bit rumpled, Savage is all spit-and-polish, a by-the-book general stopping just short of being a martinet.

  TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH is a convincing look at the problems of command without any distracting side stories mucking up things.  Dean Jagger, as Maj. Harvey Stovall, won a deserved Academy Award as the general's soft-spoken clerk, a lawyer in real life, who acts as the chronicler of the evolution of the 918th from a dissension ridden outfit to a formidable fighting unit.  The movie, in fact, is presented as Stovall's post-war flashback.

  TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH uses authentic combat film of US and German planes in action.  The film is well incorporated in the movie, it feels real, but battle is secondary to the human drama at the heart of the movie.

271015,5,6300247090,"It's natural that all of the customer reviews for this movie elaborate on the military context.  From that perspective, there is nothing more to add that hasn't already been written - Twelve O'Clock High is a magnificant war movie made shortly after WWII, and is worthy viewing now, 50+ years after it was made.  Yet there's another context for the movie that bears discussing.

Twelve O'Clock High is one of the best movies on leadership that has ever been made, and there are lessons applicable to today's business world that every manager could benefit from.  This is not to say that managers/leaders should put in practice the various techniques employed by Gregory Peck's character, however managers/leaders can learn how a 'manager' changed a disenfranchised and demotiviated workforce of individuals into an effective, proud group/team.

Better than spending thousands on management guru's who ineffectively train potential management 'leaders', companies would benefit by watching this movie in a group setting and discussing some of the techniques/methods the Peck character uses to transform the squadron.  There's a common modern management technique for accomplishing corporate/department/individual goals - Goals, Objectives, Strategies, and Tactics.  This is a heirarchy, where a single goal is developed, then objectives developed to accomplish the goal, then strategies developed around each objective, then finally tactics developed around each strategy.

In Peck's case, the highest order goal was something like 'Create a precision bombing squadron capable of making daylight bombing runs into Germany' (as given to him by his superior).  In order to accomplish this goal, Peck had several objectives:  1) Executional excellence within all squadran functions; 2)  Allegiance to group over self; 3)  Accomplish missions with mimimal loss of life; etc...

A strategy employed in support of objective 1) was squadran drilling - relatively unheard of for battle-hardened squadrons (i.e. ""What do we need to drill for since we've been on live missions?"").  Another strategy was to highlight and learn from poor performance  - here, Peck's character used several tactics:  1)  Group review of individual poor performers at daily briefings, and 2)  Poor performers were assigned to a 'loser's plane.

These are just a few examples of many within the film, and certainly each can be argued for and against.  There is not a more difficult leadership task then balancing a person's life, or a small group of people's, against the lives of many within your responsibility.  What managers/leaders do in the business environment pales in comparison. Nonetheless, Peck's character did transform the group, under extremely dire circumstances and incredible performance/time pressure.

However, there are other elements - making difficult decisions, giving your all, dealing with stress under extraordinary conditions.

Some say that Saving Private Ryan really epitomizes the WWII experience, and I'm sure that it does for the heroes who served on the ground.

However, don't overlook this gem of a movie.  Even if the director's cut ending is not in it.  Even if Gregory Peck sits in a chair for hours (not movie hours - this is minutes) staring at the wall.  It is worth the view.

271059,5,6300247090,"This is a magnificent World War II film about U.S. airmen stationed in Britain in the fall of 1942, and so much more; it's about the psychology that goes into situations of extreme stress, and what makes a man a winner or loser when put to the test. As General Savage (Peck) says in his pep talk, ""fear is normal, but stop worrying about it"". Savage has no time for self pity, for himself or anyone else, and his toughness and high principles bring out the best in his men, and it also points up the dangers of emotional attachment in the wrong situations.
The script by Sy Bartlett and Beirne Lay Jr., from their book which is loosely based on a true story, is intelligent and insightful, and the direction by Henry King meticulous. The cinematography by Leon Shamroy is crisp and marvelous, and also includes riveting portions of actual WWII battle footage interspersed in the aerial shots.
The Alfred Newman score also adds much to the film.
Gregory Peck is perfect as General Savage, fabulously handsome, with one of the greatest voices of the 20th century, one cannot imagine a better actor for the part.

Savage inherits a bomber squadron that has fallen upon a streak of bad luck.  The bombers are falling victim to the enemy and they are not hitting their target.  Gen. Savage comes in, whips the pilots and crews into shape, end of story.
While the plot is nothing special, the movie is absolutely brilliant.  Despite the movie being set in the military, character of Gen. Savage is universal and timeless.
Gen. Savage replaces a friend of his as the commanding officer of the 918th Bomber Group.  What makes this movie so different than other war movies is that the movie focuses on the chess game Gen. Savage has to play to get the bomber group to operate effectively with no casualties.  At first glance, there is no easy answer as to why the bomber group is not doing well.  The movie revolves around Gen. Savage picking the organization apart to find the problems.  As Gen. Savage implements changes to fix the issues, he is met with heavy resistance from his own men.  A majority of the movie is dedicated to how Gen. Savage implements the changes in the bomber group.
This movie is about strategy.  It is not about the strategy of war, but rather the strategy and the problems encountered when trying to implement organizational change.  While the move would not be as exciting, the role of Gen. Savage could as easily been a CEO or any person who overseas people.

Sadly, I think of lot of good acting has been given off-the-cuff reviews.  Peck's body of work speaks for itself, From 'To Kill a Mockingbird' to 'Guns of Navarone' - and all the deft works between - he has proved his class as an actor, as a screen legend.
Twelve O'clock high is a very moving film.  It's in B&W, and I think personally, the film benefits from this.  It gives you the grim realities of sending young men out to die and the men who shoulder that decisions.  There are bigger epics - like the air shows of 'The Battle of Britain' or the tank saga of 'The Battle of the Bulge', but I don't think any film can really touch the power of this film.  It does not deal with the battles, but the men.  It is a quiet film that address the pressures men face, the ones going out there and fighting, the ones that stay behind and give the orders.  It is bloody brilliant!
Gregory Peck stars as Brig. Gen. Frank Savage.  At the start of the film, he is dealing with the Lt. Col. Ben R. Gately played by the underrated and very natural actor, Hugh Marlowe.  Gately is very popular with his men, because he cares.  Each time he sends them out and they do not come back, his heart bleeds.  Slowly the grim guilt is grinding him down.  Savage sees his friend's problems as one of distancing himself from the men.  If you stay aloof, do not get involved with them personally, the decisions would come easier.  When Savage voices this opinion once too often, he is told to put his money with his mouth is - he is to take over for the cracking Gately.
Savage arrives.  Immediately he is in the untenable position of being he replacement for the much beloved Gately.  His by-the-book, shut up and salute, does not earn him adoration.  In fact, the whole unit has all written transfer requests.  Standing between the martinet Savage and is men who would like to frag him, is Maj. Harvey Stovall (Dean Jones in one of his best performances of his career).  Stovall was very devoted to Gately, but sees both sides of the problem and truly understands the bottom line - unless you are totally without a heart, there is NO way to keep the emotional distance from your men.  Eventually, the line is blurred and you care.  Something Savage slowly learns, and grinds him down just as Gately did.
It's brilliantly written, with incisive insight that is marvelously flesh out by powerhouse actors that give it their all.
A deeply moving film with so much heart.
Just a note - Robert Lansing played the same character for the television series of that name and did equal justice to the role.  Please release these on DVD for Lansing fans.",1073520000,76,2802,4.481262327416173

The current cut, for example, does not explain the significance of the Toby mug that Dean Jagger finds in a London shop and replaces on the airbase officers' club mantlepiece. There are others, such as what happens to the young navigator and why. Obviously, I think this is one of the greatest war movies of all time.

The character of General Frank Savage (Gregory Peck) is reputedly based on Brigadier General Frank A. Armstrong, Jr. Sy Bartlett co-authored the screenplay with the book's author, Berney Lay, Jr. Brilliantly directed by Henry King, we are introduced to a combination of combat fatigue and self-pity which results in the replacement of Colonel Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill) by his friend Savage who is told by his commanding officer, General Pritchard (Millard Mitchell), to shape up the 918th while avoiding Davenport's problem: Becoming overly involved emotionally in decisions to send B-17 crews on exceptionally dangerous missions, day after day after day. Savage immediately establishes his authority and almost immediately loses whatever goodwill he may have had. He applies and then maintains constant pressure on the crews to improve their performance in all areas of flight operations. Underachievers are reassigned to one B-17 renamed ""The Leper Colony."" Morale deteriorates to such a point that those at headquarters become concerned. A formal investigation of the situation is conducted. This is a critical moment for Savage.  If he has ""lost"" his men, he cannot continue. In fact, he expects to be relieved and begins to pack his personal items. However, for reasons best revealed in the film, Savage remains in command. And then....

It would be a disservice to those who have not as yet seen this film to say any more about the plot. Suffice to say that brilliant direction, great acting by everyone involved (notably by Dean Jagger who received an Academy Award for best actor in a supporting role), superb cinematography (Leon Shamroy), and haunting music (Alfred Newman) are seamlessly integrated in this analysis of effective leadership (especially decision-making) under wartime conditions. The film begins when Harvey Stovall (Jagger) makes an especially significant purchase in an antique store and then proceeds to what has by then become an abandoned air base. As we begin to hear the bombers' propellers whine as the engines roar to life, we are transported back in time. Later, as the film ends, civilian Stovall climbs back on his rented bike and departs what is again an abandoned air base. Stunning images throughout both sequences.

Peck included this among his favorite films, while adding that he was especially proud of his performance as Frank Savage. When first released more than 50 years ago, it did not receive the recognition (much less the appreciation) it so obviously deserves. Whenever CEOs and other senior-level executives ask me to suggest war films which offer important lessons about leadership and management, Twelve O'Clock High is first on the list, joined by (in alphabetical order) Command Decision, The Dirty Dozen, The Enemy Below, Fort Apache, The Hunt for Red October, Paths of Glory, Pork Chop Hill, The Red Badge of Courage, They Were Expendable, and Zulu.",1058918400,188,3148,5.254473161033797

It's really something to watch General Savage (Gregory Peck) transform himself into a fear-force-and-terror type of leader because that's what the organization he's taking over needs.  As the organization improves and he gets to know the men more, you can see him trying to maintain this style and keep what it's costing him hidden.  In the end, he not only succeeds in fixing the initial problem, he also instills leadership into his subordinates to such an extent that they naturally take command when needed.  The cost to him was great.  But, it's a job that needed to be done.",1055376000,3,661,4.866071428571429

271120,5,6300247090,"Twelve ""O'Clock High is a powerful and true-to-life film dealing with the early days of the 8th US Air Force in Great Britain.  Its mission: to bomb Germany not by night in saturation bombings as the British were doing, but instead to boldly engage in ""precision daylight bombing.""  No one knew if the concept was viable because no one had ever dared try it before on a large scale.  Gregory Peck plays the role of a leader suddenly thrust into command of a deeply troubled, demoralized, and shot-up bomber squadron.  How he motivates the men and overcomes the fact that the men well know that their chances of survival were poor (the worst survival odds of any American combat assignment in the war) is a deeply moving, powerful, indeed unforgettable story.  This is a great movie.
The cinematography of this movie is wonderful, featuring actual combat footage of B-17s engaging German Focke-Wulf fighters in deadly combat.  The sense of authenticity that this movie brings to the screen is total.  One feels transposed back into England in 1942, engaged in a life-and-death struggle in the air against the Germans.  The uniforms, dialogue, everything, about this movie reeks of authenticity.  The storyline moves along at a breakneck pace--no dull interludes.  And yet this is not just a ""shoot-em-up"" war flick.  It is a stirring story of leadership, personality clashes, honest fear and human imperfections that reminds us what an incredible debt we all owe to the men who fought and won the air war over Nazi Germany.
This is a DVD movie to keep and watch repeatedly over the years.  It is not only a great movie, it is wonderfully entertaining.  This is truly one of the all-time great war movies.",1046131200,12,1703,4.85121107266436

I was amazed that when you watch this movie with an eye to leadership you can actually identify two types of leaders.
Colonel Keith Davenport is what is known as an X leader he takes on the responsibility for everything never delegating responsibility and as a result having a nervous breakdown
General Savage is mat first) a Y leader basically he says ""quite coddling these kids, take the diapers off and let them do there jobs.
My impression-This is an excellent film about war and the power of motivation on a unit who has had its moral shattered.

GREGORY PECK gives a great performance,strong and also vulnerable in the end. Considering that this film was made in 1949,it's certainly a classic. If you love war films with a lot of action,a girl ornementation and a HOLLYWOOD vision,don't see this movie,it's simply beyond you.",1041465600,3,615,4.923076923076923
271123,1,6300247090,"Twelve O'clock High is about an air force commander (Gary Merril) who has reached his breaking point. Brigadier General Savage (Gregory Peck) takes his place, and is at first very tough with the pilots who are now under his command. They resent Savage at first, but slowly change as he leads them to success. But soon Savage reaches his own breaking point.
I really disliked Twelve O'clock High. It was a really a boring movie. Roughly 5 minutes of the 2 hour and 12 minute movie involved aerial scenes. In one sequence, we see the crew boarding their planes. Then we see a 3 second clip of airplanes flying above the clouds. Then we cut back to the airfield where the crews are getting out of their planes. It was just way too short. The key to the movie was the aerial bombing aspect of it. That was what drove the first air force commander (Gary Merril) to the breaking point. But all we see is him talking about what happened during the bombing run. The same goes for Savage, who is also driven to his breaking point. All we get to see of him in combat is some short but spectacular aerial battle footage.
The characters themselves are weak. You don't really have any feelings for the characters. The sad message that comes across is true; these pilots should consider themselves dead, because they don't know if they'll ever make it out alive. But the movie lacks any sense of emotion. It just drags on and on with dialogue scenes that are extremely boring. It was also very loosely held together. You can't even tell when the pilots are beginning to like Savage instead of resenting him.
I would not recommend this movie to anyone. The spectacular aerial battle footage wasn't enough to salvage this boring film. I would suggest The Guns Of Navarone or The Bridge On The River Kwai instead.",1040688000,7,1796,4.563467492260062

271145,5,6300247090,"Gregory Peck stars as a general sent in to replace Gary Merrill, another general of a failing daylight bombing group.  Merrill has become too close to his men, clouding his judgment and allowing the men to view themselves as the ""hard luck"" squad.  Peck decides to take a very different approach.  He plays it tough, wants everyone whipped into shape, expects nothing but the best, and hopes that by eventually restoring a sense of pride after some successful missions, the men will come around.  Needless to say, the men resent him and his approach, transfer requests pour in, and it becomes questionable whether Peck's strategy can work.  Peck is outstanding as the general, a perfect choice for the role.  Merrill and Hugh Marlowe both give unusually strong performances, and Dean Jagger as a Major working in the office, delivers a subtle, humourous, and very intelligent performance that helps to anchor the film for the viewer.  Although there are some good action sequences, this film isn't about the action of the War.  It's about leadership and building pride, and it could apply to any organization. It also shows what an unreal thing war is, and what it does to the men involved.  Twelve O'Clock High is an outstanding war film, not because of the rah-rah heroics, but because of it's honest and real approach to the men whose lives are being put on the line.

271147,5,6300247090,"Twelve O'Clock High proves that the best war movies are suspenseful and exciting without having to resort to shots of brutal fighting or the bloody aftermath. Although this movie makes the viewer keenly aware of the horrors of combat and its effect on people, it does not actually depict things the gory detail so common today. This is a great movie - perhaps the best war movie ever - and it is good mainly because of its fabulous cast and clever, insightful script.
Twelve O'Clock High is about a struggling squadron of American precision air bombers in Europe. After their benevolent, compassionate commander (Gary Merrill) cracks under the stress of having to send young men up to die, the normally understanding and reasonable General Savage (Gregory Peck) is called in to take over. In order to restore the morale of the group and instill them with pride and honor, Savage becomes incredibly strict and works the group very hard - which leads to some astonishing successes. But before long, the stress of leadership begins to get to Savage as well...
Anyhow, this is a very exciting movie! It even uses actual footage from WWII airplane battles. Furthermore, besides being entertaining, Twelve O'Clock High makes many interesting points about the responsibilities of leadership and the toll those responsibilities take on men. Unlike many similar dramas from the time, it has aged well and is just as relevant today as it was when it was first made. What is maximum effort, it also asks.

271149,5,6300247090,"I recently watched 12'o clock high as a part of the curricula for a leadership program.  I had previously viewed this classic for pleasure over a period of many years ..going back to my childhood in post world war 2 england when this film first appeared..1949.
This film never fails to move me both emotionally and intellectually.  Young boys forced to be men and face death in doing their duty to serve their country and protect the free world in the biggest threat that had been confronted on a global level.
American airman, officers and flight crews, in the first phase of American airpower of world war 2, are being used by the US command to determine maximum effort of planes and men as they carry out a strategy of precision bombing.  The story focuses on a hard luck Group who appear to be losing too many men and planes.  They are commanded by Keith Davenport (Gary Merill) extremely popular with his men, however, his inability to delegate to his fellow officers and his overidentification with his men are causing both his own mental breakdown and may be at the root of the hard luck and the accompanying loss of life.
Enter Gregory Peck, Colonel Savage, an admirer and friend of Davenport the man but critical of Davenport the Commander. Peck is assigned by the commanding general to determine the cause of the problems and turn around the record of the Group.  His strategy is to turn around the whole culture of the Group from a hierarchical structure of benevolent Command from the top to a harsh albeit more democratic sharing of responsibility and leadership from officers and men. He frames for the men the harsh reality of their situation ....stop worrying about getting killed, think of yourself as already dead..dont make plans for the future..dont lean on your immediate buddies and roomates but look to the whole Group as your family because the integrity of the Group when it is in battle formation is what will help survival....  He faces the complete opposition of all his pilots who request a transfer out. He, however has faith in their ability to be adults and begins to build a critical mass of support,little by little, by going back to basics in his training and in his communication.  The process of building the foundation to ensure the Group's ability to deal with the maximum effort...takes it's toll on Peck who, in sense, doesn't deal with his own reality as another human being pushed to the extent of his own threshold of maximum effort.
The story highlights different modes of leadership in the face of the most difficult of circumstances.
As you watch the film notice different artifacts that are used to dramatize the story..a pewter mug in the Shape of a Pirate Captain used to conjure up the memory and the telling of this story; flight boots used to pass on the mantel of leadership; an airplane dubbed the leper colony manned by malingerers and the less competent but transformed into a place of learning and redemption, the chevrons on the sleeve of a sergeant that are removed and replaced as the sergeant makes mistakes and redeems himself.
This finally is another story of the greatest generation who went through a rite of passage, survived if they were lucky enought, while they were making the world safe for all of us...Bless them all..the long and the short and the tall!!!",1023321600,6,3329,4.749134948096886
271150,4,6300247090,"I've seen this movie a number of times, and always appreciate the work that went into it.  I was required to watch this movie during a training class on leadership while I attending the U.S. Air Force's Officer Training School.  The leadership styles of the characters in the movie were held up as examples of the ""right way"", the ""wrong way"", and ""don't-let-this-happen-to-you"" ways of managing people and situations.
It's interesting to note that some of the instances of leadership and some of the problems encountered in running the bomb groups have their basis in fact.  The changeover of command from a colonel who ""cares too much for his men"" to a hard-nosed general officer taking command stems from an actual incident.  For further specifics on this item, check out the book ""Decision Over Schweinfurt"", by Thomas M. Coffey.  It's an interesting nonfiction account of USAAF daylight bombing over Germany.

By today's standards, it may seem poor in its special effects, but as a look into combat leadership it is superior.  This film demonstrates how military leadership has nothing to do with medals and parades, but a constant battle to make a group of people do a thankless, unglorious job.  This movie does a great job in showing the strains of leadership and the personal sacrifices one must make to succeed in war. Gregory Peck stars as a very human leader who makes mistakes and yet still presses on, and also one who gives everything he's got to make his unit the best it can be -- for their sake and not for his.

271204,4,6300247090,"This is a film which was made four years after the end of the Second World War and it uses a lot of actual documentary footage. The plot is about a squadron of US heavy bombers. The film is set at a time in the war when the German air defences were at their most efficient and they were taking a heavy toll of the unescorted US bombers.
The plot of the film is about a tough commanding officer who is appointed to try to keep things together despite the ferocious punishment being suffered by the US air crews. He stigmatises those who have lost their nerve by having them fly in a plane marked for cowards. For the other air crews he emphasises discipline as a means of ensuring the bombers keep tight formation to maximise the defensive potential of their guns and produce accurate bombing.
Initially his toughness and uncompromising attitude leads to hostility from the men he commands. As the film progresses however it becomes clear that he has always had a deep respect for the men who have flown under him. The last scene is one of the more effective as it shows him breaking down as he realises the number of casualties in a particular action.
War films often do not age very well at all. Those made close to the conflict they portray are often jingoistic or are unreal. This film is unusual as it has dated well and is still easy to watch even today. The action scenes using old footage are simply amazing. In summary a film which still is effective and has power to move an audience today.",1014854400,7,1499,4.415162454873646
271205,5,6300247090,"When most people think of a war movie, they think of hordes of soldiers charging an enemy position as machine guns mow them down while shells create spectacular explosions in the background. Twelve O'Clock High is different; Except for a combat mission near the film's end, there is hardly any combat action. Yet it is often regarded as one of the best war movies. (Some plot spoilers).
Gregory Peck is outstanding in one of his greatest performances. Portraying Air Force General Savage, Peck takes command of the 918th Bomb Group during the early years of World War II, when daylight bombing over Europe was still in question. The previous commander, Col. Keith Davenport was relieved of command for getting too involved with his men and reaching a breaking point. After their most recent mission was a failure, moral is low in the unit. When Savage takes over, he also discovers that discipline isn't strict enough in the unit. Guards, for example, don't check on people entering the base and on-duty officers leave their posts to get drunk.
Savage, at first, enforces discipline on the 918th members, particularly the lazy air executive officer, to the point where the pilots put in requests for transfer. The transfers are delayed, allowing Savage time to change his men's minds. As the 918th successfully completes one mission after another, Gen. Savage soon comes to know and respect his men and feel for him like his own children. The pilots withdraw their transfers and Savage begins to push himself further on the missions to find out what a `Maximum Effort' is. However, the stress of command and the loss of some pilots soon starts effecting Savage and he breaks down as well.
This movie is excellent in how it studies about the psychological effect of war on men. As seen in this film, the bomber crews could take a lot of flying, but only so much. There is one scene I particularly like in the movie. After a mission in the film's beginning, one of the flyers tells an interrogation officer about the bloody flight, where one man was decapitated. The description is detailed, yet none of the actual damage is shown. It goes to show that words can be just as powerful as images.",1013385600,12,2191,4.783641160949868

A few of these movies dealt with the real issues of the human mind and leadership.  Such WWII films as ""The Best Years of Our Lives"", ""Stalag 17"" and ""Twelve O'Clock High"" actually dealt with the human factor and how their actions affected those around them.
Twelve O'Clock High is one of the greatest WWII dramas ever made. This story is timeless and leaves an everlasting effect on us because it deals with people (we can all relate to these situations and our ability to cope or deal with them).
This film deals with; Leadership, Responsibility, Loyalty and Honor.  All these factors affect all of us and how we deal with our ability to perform and navigate through life.
Summary:  United States early involvement in WWII started in England (late 1942).  We had B17 Bomber Squadrons involved in a new strategy, ""Daylight Precision Bombing"".  This was a very critical and costly tactic.  There were high losses of men and bombers.  Morale was at its lowest point and the Leadership roles were in jeopardy.

Because of his inability to successfully complete his squadrons missions was relieved by General Savage (Gregory Peck - Outstanding performance).  Savage believed in the mission, training and Lead by example Commanding Officer. This caused resentment from his pilots & crews and the long uphill battle to make the squadron successful begins.

271208,5,6300247090,"12 O'Clock High is one of the best films on leadership ever made. The story opens with the return to England of American bomber pilots from a daylight bombing mission over Nazi occupied Europe.  Colonel Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill) is the commander of a squadron whose task it is to destroy German military installations.  He is a competent professional officer who cares deeply for his men.  Unfortunately, in his zeal to keep them from being killed, he forgets his mission and is relieved of his command.
Col. Davenport is replaced by General Frank Savage (Gregory Peck), who says to the pilots at his first meeting with them, ""Consider yourself already dead.""  This speech signals a completely different approach to leadership.  General Savage relentlessly trains the pilots and succeeds in building a first-rate fighting unit.  His hard line does not come without a price.  His men rebel and want to be transferred out of the unit.  Only with the help of his adjutant (Dean Jagger) does Savage hold the group together and begin to build competence and esprit de corp.
The effects of contrasting leadership styles have seldom been so effectively portrayed.  Colonel Davenport is a first-rate officer who over identifies with his men and fails miserably.  The moral of the story is that the appropriate leadership style is essential to accomplish challenging goals and objectives.  It is not enough to be hard working, conscientious, and caring.  Leaders must analyze the situation, know the competence and commitment of their people, and then select the style of leadership appropriate for the task at hand.
The dramatic scenes between Davenport, Savage, and the American pilots are expertly written and filled with tension.  Actual war footage is used for several of the action scenes and the film moves forward at a steady pace.

Believe me, there was not a dry eye in the room as we watched the general die.  I have a feeling this scene was deleted for being too powerful for a post-WWII audience.

The movie's presentation is excellent. Contrast is good and the image is clean and crisp.

The ONLY extras are a selection of original trailers from other war films: THE LONGEST DAY, PATTON, THE THIN RED LINE, TORA! TORA! TORA! and THE SAND PEBBLES. There isn't even a trailer for TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH, the very movie presented on the disc! I suppose Fox didn't have anything and included those other trailers (a) to make up for it, and (b) as free promotion for their other DVDs. Well, okay, I guess I don't have a problem with that... but why is the list price ... the SAME as that of TORA! TORA! TORA! which includes a new 20-minute documentary and commentary, and THE SAND PEBBLES which also includes a commentary and some audio features? For such a bare-bones disc (and one that fewer consumers are likely to impulse-buy) I think it's a bit of a mistake to price TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH so high.
Do I think it's worth it? With the [discountedprice] certainly.  Even at list price, it's still a terrific movie that makes a nice addition to your collection. It's just a pity there couldn't be more bang for the buck.",989884800,13,1893,4.701807228915663
271267,5,6300247090,"This film has been seen for years as a depiction of management style--""Tigers"" by Gregory Peck, ""Lambs"" by Gary Merrill.  But for whom would you rather work?  Business is rarely life or death.
Dean Jagger and Hugh Marlow are magnificent.  As a political drama, it surpasses Command Decision, another terrific film that smacks too much of its stage origins.",989280000,,356,5.0
271268,5,6300247090,"This is one of Gregory Peck's finest performances.  He is simply terrific in a uniformly excellent cast, with standout support from Dean Jagger especially.
A study in the demands and stress of command, they played this one straight, without phony histrionics.  How do you get men to face terror and death in the skies day after day?  What does leading and losing men you've come to know do to you?
Not really a combat film (the airborne raid depicted comes late in the film) it nonetheless is one of the best films ever made delineating subtely and surely what the terror and stress of combat does to men.
Simply put, I agree with my fellow reviewers that this is one of the best war films ever made.  The B&W photogaphy, as is so often the case, makes the film all the more real, locating it in it's time and place.  The dialogue excellent, the emotions and conflicts real.  Thank God they didn't throw in some romance or other distraction.
This is a story of how men work together, argue, disagree, but get on with it.  It shows the resolve to get the job done, but also the underlying comraderie, care and sacrifice necessary to acclompish seeming impossible tasks.
 I always think of the tenderness shown in the last scene when Gary Merrill, who got bounced and whose job was taken by Peck's Gen. Savage, takes off a now asleep Peck's flying boots and covers him with a blanket.  This is as quietly eloquent an expression of the respect and regard men in combat have for each other as has ever been shown.  This is a great film.",985737600,9,1532,4.498194945848375
271269,5,6300247090,"This movie is, quite simply, a classic.  It isn't your typical war movie, but that is a good thing.  Typical war movies glorify war, and any vet will tell you war is hell.  ""TO'CH"" is gritty realism.  Shot in black and white, it presents the men of the fictional bomber group (based I believe on the 100th BG) as well as the book of the same name.  It is as much a movie about relationships and the demands of leadership as it is about the air war.  The acting is superb.  Of course Gregory Peck is great but also the character of the Ops officer is brilliantly portrayed as well, though I'm not sure of the actor's name.  A few elements of the novel have been removed, either to tighten the plot or keep the movie from being long.  Some of that material isn't necessary to the plot development, some I would have liked to see. I am a historian and teacher currently researching a book on the Eighth in WWII, as well as a novel, and one of the questions I've been asking the men who were there is 'what movie best shows the air war and life on base as it really was?' The answer, almost unanimously, is ""TO'CH"". For those who would like to see another excellent video of the Mighty Eighth, I highly recommend a documentary called ""Pistol Packing Mama: The Story of a B-17"" that can also be ordered from Amazon.com.  No video library on the air war over Europe would be complete without these two fine videos on the shelf.",981676800,7,1421,4.30827067669173
271270,5,6300247090,"I attended Graduate School at the University of Colorado a fewyears back and was pleasantly surprised to find this film to be one of the focal points of a management/organizational behavior class.  I've watched it on numerous occasions since I was a kid gluing together old Monogram 'Forts and pretending to be General Savage piloting the ""Picadilly Lilly"". The film has held together remarkedly well over the years with its central precipts: the terror of war; group dynamics; and the burdens of command still ringing true. Upon reflection, it is indeed odd that King, Peck, Jagger and company were able to successfully convey all of that with comparatively little ""action."" If remade today, we no doubt would be treated to endless simulated- green screen - battle sequences wherein... would attempt to underscore the same subtle points that make the original so compelling to watch.  Lastly, Peck's performance has never really received its due.  Alternatively passionate and subtle, he fleshes out Savage's character beyond its largely marrionette-like roots and humanizes it to the point where his latent desire to be accepted as ""one of the boys"" eventually proves to be his own little Waterloo - just like his predecessor!
Whew, imagine getting this analytical about something more contemporary like ""The Patriot""!",967593600,4,1320,5.276190476190476
271271,5,6300247090,"Those who think that ""Saving Private Ryan"" was a great movie ought to watch this old black and white classic.  In virtually every aspect except photography and sound ""Twelve O'Clock High"" is superior.  The script by Sy  Bartlett in particular is vastly superior.

Spielberg's film focused on  some of the command problems faced by Capt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) in  fulfilling his combat mission, but the treatment and development were  almost high schoolish (if I may) compared to the enthralling delineation in  ""Twelve O'Clock High.""  The problems encountered by Gregory Peck as the  bomber group commander were complex, subtle and psychologically demanding,  while the resolution was filled with the kind of male social and political  dynamics not much explored at the movies these days.  (We have female  dynamics aplenty.)

Director Henry King's clean, crisp, ""invisible""  direction was also superior to the uneven and far too showy pandering from  Spielberg.  Furthermore the acting, with Gary Merrill and Hugh Marlowe  supporting Peck, was also better.  Ted Danson in his cameo and Matt Damon  at times in ""Saving Private Ryan"" were almost laughable.

Comparing the  two movies makes one wonder how much movies really have improved.  Technically they have in every respect, but too often today's film-makers  think they can get by with special effects and splashy sets.  Pour a lot of  blood, show a lot of skin, get people at each other's throat, and it will  play, seems to be the attitude.  What is often forgotten are the two most  important aspects of film, namely, story and character development.  In  this respect I don't think today's films have improved on the great  classics of the past.

271272,5,6300247090,"Gregory Peck is one of the best actors of all time, in my opinion.  I have reviewed the ""real life"" story of the General (later Air Marshall) who most closely resembles the character played by Gregory Peck,  under the book ""Despatch on War Operations: 23rd February, 1942, to  8th May, 1945,"" by Air Marshall Sir Arthur T. Harris.  See that review  in Amazon.com for more details.  Recently a number of major magazines have  selected Gregory Peck's leadership style, as portrayed in this movie, as  one of the most effective leadership/management styles: making rapid  decisions under fire that go to the heart of the matter.  Other styles also  can be combined with it or alternate with it: concern about employees and  the public, concern about the truth, calmness - for example, the leader  who, when provoked outrageously, never replies worse than: ""That's  possible,"" or ""I don't know about that.""  Peck, by the way,  like Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness, has made it to the top with a  ""class act,"" which for the benefit of the ""cool""  generation means: only grade A level material.  His characters don't rely  on sensationalism or skipping out on their wives to attract attention,  unlike some political leaders and teenage idols.",957571200,10,1237,4.965686274509804
