This was an inspiring story of teens looking for a ""better"" direction to the chaos that surrounds them.  Too many adults complain about the loitering and the ""noise"" of young teens.  They fail to see the success coming or a new found hope being projected.  Adults complain too much and really don't want to be part of the solution.  This is an avenue of hope to where society has broken down the family core.  I intend to purchase the music of this group through Amazon.com, if it is offered.  Amazon has treated me well and has been a safe link to purchase through.  May the Gospel continue to advance through these children.",1302134400,2,722,4.492307692307692
8442200,1,B004UTC8CK,"It's clear that 60 Minutes did not speak to the neighbors of the Mama Foundation.  The Mama Foundation operates with a complete disregard for the quality of life and health of its neighbors.  Housed in a brownstone on a residential block, the Mama Foundation is so noisy that the police have been called several times.  The Mama Foundation has also been warned by the Department of Environmental Protection, but it continues to behave with a callous indifference to its neighbors.  Youths loiter on neighboring homes, and noise on Friday night, Saturday afternoons and even sometimes Sunday is horrible.  The only thing that is important to the Mama Foundation is to exploit naive young people and abuse neighbors in its tawdry clutch at second-hand fame for its founder, Vy Higginsen.  Next time, 60 Minutes, do your research!",1302048000,,827,5.044117647058823
