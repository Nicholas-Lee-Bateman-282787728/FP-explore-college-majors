8653967,2,B000COQ9ZY,"Steven Poser Chartered Market Technician CMT, is a successful investor and very well educated in the field of technical analysis. In 2003 Poser wrote Applying Elliott Wave Theory Profitably. Poser's book went into great lengths on how to trade Elliot Wave EW. As an active trader, I found Applying Elliott Wave Theory Profitably more applicable than Precter's EW books, which are much more theoretical and go into great lengths about the history of EW and Ralph Nelson Elliott R.E.N.

After reading his book and seeing Poser was a presenter on a Market Technicians Association MTA video, I was expecting to learn something. Instead I purchased a lecturer that glossed over the subject and did not seem like he was interested in presenting Elliott Wave. Poser kept on talking about what he thinks you need to know to pass the CMT test, but he's not sure what's on the test, and yadda yadda yadda-ing everything.  After about 10 mintues you start to yawn and you are not sure if you can keep it going. I found one interesting tidbit that could help measure my corrective wave counts, that's about it. So I give this video two stars instead of one.

Also...
If I had to compare this DVD to other DVD's on the subject of technical analysis, which most but not all cover EW, I would say subpar. My advice to anyone looking for EW information in video format, try YouTube, it's free.  I would also suggest MTA decommission this video and try again. Not worth $39.99",1361059200,,1459,4.6875
