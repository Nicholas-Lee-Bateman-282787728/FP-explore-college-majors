8633885,4,B00HNTUQUU,"Therion sounds amazing live. I mean you can just watch the bootlegs on youtube and they sound awesome. Yet almost everytime they record a show it comes out sounding bad. I have been waiting forever hoping to get a live CD of the 20th anniversary show. I guess that won't happen now. The 20th anniversary show is ok to watch but not good enough sound quality for music. The band plays good its just the recording quality and filming is not great. The second show is decent but not great. I'm not sure why they keep hiring people that do a lousy job at recording their shows. The Miskolc Experience was pretty good except some of the opera singers didn't sing loud enough and messed up some songs. It could have been a mind blowing performance but instead was just good. Now this.

I wish they would hire a really good camera and recording crew and make multiple recordings that way if one recording sucks they can use the alternative. Then do the same show two days in a row and record both shows, again in case something is messed up. They really need to make sure this stuff doesn't happen again. I don't mean to go back and make the ""live"" album in the studio like some bands do, but just take some necessary steps to make sure they deliver a good product worth buying. Problem is Therion seems really good at playing music live but really lousy at recording it.

Anyway you can play the DVDs in your computer regardless of format.

Celebrators of Becoming is better than this one.",1395792000,,1483,4.444852941176471
8633886,4,B00HNTUQUU,This DVD won't play on most North American DVD players it is not NSTC standard .Nuclear Blast America has yet to release a version yet. There are also 2 versions sold on listing. One is of lesser quality and doesn't have two Therion music videos on it. The concert from Atlanta is very well filmed along with excellent sound. The first concert has a lesser sound quality.,1395273600,2,371,4.552238805970149
