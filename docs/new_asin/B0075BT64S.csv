Cheers,

5057137,3,B0075BT64S,"Actually you might rate this 2.7 out of 5. The sound quality is bad mono, but for those of us who actually went to a Beatles concert, that's pretty good. That you can hear them play at all is what makes this disc worth collecting. As my memeory serves me, I kind of recall McCartney's bass and Ringo, a bit of high harmonies and then a wall of screaming. Like it or not, the shows were only 25 to 30 minutes (saw them twice) and yet, and yet...... there was definitely something about them that set them very far apart.
What you get from this DVD is the sense of the context and the whole of a performance that you never got from Ed Sullivan. Just a few days after their incredible TV debut, they performed in DC. Lennon still looks like a deer in the headlights, much as he did on Ed Sullivan, while McCartney seems to have recognized that his partner's drive to get to the toppermost of the poppermost had hit its apex and John had no idea where to go from there. It seems very clear that from America onward, this was McCartney's band. No doubt the resentment Lennon bore him at the end of the decade may have begun at this point. He was about to become an extra in his own movie, as he would later say of HELP.  It is written all over Lennon's face that he sensed that this was bigger than he had imagined and that he was not equipped to take it from here. Harrison is much more than just the quiet one: when he sees McCartney kick in, he's right there with him seeking to take this juggernaut as far as it will go and Ringo seems to relish in the prospect of working with such a very tight band. And at this point, it is definitely McCartney's musicality that will inspire and drive them forward.
There's a lot of filler in this to stretch it out to 40 minutes, most of which involves interviews that are chronologically later than this tour, but nonetheless, it is what it is, and to that extent, with an appropriate caveat emptor, this is a decent enough document of what it was like at the very beginning.
Now, if the boys and the estates of 2 of the boys would just release the entire rooftop concert from January 30, 1969......",1068336000,4,2137,4.250614250614251
5057138,1,B0075BT64S,"This is the first review I have ever written on Amazon and find it necessary to tell people NOT to waste their money on this DVD! I was very disappointed in everything about this DVD.
1. Picture quality is poor!
2. Sound quality is poor!
3. DVD is SHORT! Has only 9 songs and lasts like a 1/2 hour!
From now on, I will never pre-order a DVD, especially a concert, until it has been out and I can read reviews on whether it is worth it or not! BOTTOM LINE---DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!",1067731200,7,481,4.127659574468085
5057139,2,B0075BT64S,"What can I say, I was expecting a nice high quality DVD
of this concert.  However I am sorry to say that this DVD
was not as good as several pirated ""bootleg"" versions
of the same concert that I already have.
To make the situation worse, the ""Bootleg"" versions that
I have are the complete show (including the song, ""Long
Tall Sally""), however this DVD is missing many songs.
When you consider that the show was only about 30 minutes,
it makes you wonder why the company that put this DVD out
did not include all of the songs.
Save yourself the money and buy the pirated version,
it is better and complete.
Lets hope someday that someone will issue
this concert with all of the songs
as well as the film being restored
for higher quality.",1067385600,11,738,4.386861313868613
5057140,1,B0075BT64S,"I've been collecting and dodging bad Beatles video for decades.  I thought I'd seen it all.
Until this...
This is, without question, the WORST excuse for a grey market Beatles rip-off I have EVER seen.  There've been numerous knock-offs of this show for as long as there has been home video.  Boot VHS, quasi-legit VHS, the ""official"" comps on ""Anthology"" and ""First Vist""...I've seen them all.
But I have never, EVER seen anything this wretched.
The video ""quality"" of this is unbelievable.  It's like a copy of a copy of a copy of a bad dub from someone's 25-year-old boot copy.  I'll grant it that some nitwit has tweaked the audio to some degree, but visually this is virtually unwatchable.
Not to mention that the edits are ridiculous, it's not in order, two songs are missing...and I'm STILL being kind to it.
""Anthology"" has most of this, in incredibly better quality (sadly, incomplete).  If you own ""Beatles First Visit"" DVD or VHS, you've got a bit more.  Heck, the Goodtimes DVD of ""The Beatles Unauthorized"" that you can find here is 250 times better than this.
I cannot believe how bad this is.  I thought I'd seen it the worst, but as of today, the worst has hit a new low.
This concert is wonderful and historic - so get ""Beatles Unauthorized"" if you want most of it, and if you've got ""Anthology"" and/or ""First Visit"" you've got the best of it.  But do not, under ANY circumstances, buy this DVD.",1066435200,100,1412,4.5936254980079685
5057141,1,B0075BT64S,"I got this thinking that I would be getting the Closed Circuit version film that has been cleaned up. I also thought I'd be getting the whole show uninterrupted. It cuts away before and after each song and then puts the publishing info up on screen at the start and finish of each song(like MTV does...) It still cuts the concert footage short and doesn't have ""Long Tall Sally"" which was the show closer.
Then to add insult they have a stupid triva game at the last segment of the DVD.... Don't Waste Your Money! Buy the Beatles First Visit to the States instead. Much better quality picture and audio. This looks like a bad bootleg video copy.",1066435200,14,645,4.47457627118644
5057142,3,B0075BT64S,"While nice to finally own this document of the historic Washington D.C. Beatles concert on DVD I was disappointed. Why? Because it is not the complete concert for one thing. I have an old VHS copy of this event which contains the entire show. Missing from this DVD are both ""Long Tall Sally"" and ""This Boy"". And for me, ""This Boy"" is the highlight of the entire show. John Paul and George share a single microphone while harmonizing flawlessly under difficult conditions. (horrible noise, no monitors etc.) And when John belts out his solo vocal in the middle of the song the emotion and feeling is staggering. But for some reason this number was cut from this DVD. The DVD also chops up the show and sticks little interview bits between the numbers, often from years later with no connection to this show. So we also miss the frequent turning of Ringo's drum kit after every couple of songs. The interviews destroy the continuity of the show. The disc would have been better had the show gone on uninterrupted. Still, this is better than nothing, and it's all we've got for now. The trivia game section was fun and fairly well put together. (I never knew what John Lennon really wrote on that reporter's pad in ""A Hard Day's Night"" before...shocking!). The End.",1066003200,19,1262,4.663677130044843
5057143,5,B0075BT64S,"I have a copy of an unauthorized version of this performance, and I think it's wonderful.  A portion of it is shown in The Beatles Anthology, and the film The Beatles - The First U.S. Visit has a pretty good chunk of it.  It is true that a portion of the second to the last song, and the last song are missing in the unauthorized version.
As for the concert itself, it is really a piece of rock and roll history.  The Beatles are happy, young and fresh.  They are in the middle of an auditorium almost like center court on a basketball court.  The audience is all around them and Ringo's drums are on a round riser in the middle.  The band turns the riser around a few times so everyone can get a look at them.  The only sound system is their onstage amps; and, you can clearly see, even in the grainy unauthorized version, the audience throwing handfulls of jelly beans at the band.  It is true also, that the unauthorized version of this concert has some audio problems, specifically when Ringo sings ""I Wanna be Your Man.""  His mike is dead so you can't really hear him except that he's yelling it out and you probably get a little of it through the other's mikes.  I really doubt they will be able to digitally ""repair"" this.  It will be interesting to find out.
The concert was video taped from a couple of different angles, basically from whichever side the drum riser was pointed to at the time.  The footage was then transfered to film and it was theatrically released so people could go to the theater and see the Beatles live.
I really can't say enough about this concert though.  You have to remember that the kids in the U.S. really had not had much exposure to the Beatles yet, so they aren't sreaming constantly during the concert.  You can actually hear them play, and it is a very intimate setting, the audience could have walked right up to them if they wanted.  The Beatles walk in, play and then walk out at the end.  They leave their instruments laying on the stage when they are done.  It's amazing.  There is such a huge difference between this concert and the Shea Stadium concert it's kind of scary.  At Shea, they are way out by second base, everyone is screaming and fainting, and I think the Beatles arrive or leave by helicopter, I can't remember which.
Another interesting thing about this concert is the huge amount of still photographs that were taken during the performance.  I would guess there are probably at least a hundred still shots of this performance that were used constantly during the marketing of the early Beatles.  Many of them ended up in the first couple series of Beatles trading cards.  It will be interesting to see how many of them end up either on the DVD or in it's packaging.
I would consider ""The Beatles Live in Washington DC 1964"" to be a must have!!  Also, check out my review of The Beatles - The First U.S. Visit, another must have.",1064016000,9,2894,4.429111531190927
5057144,3,B0075BT64S,"What I can say is, this is a black and white program, recorded in 1964, and the sound mix in every version I've seen is a bit rough, done on the fly. Some instruments come through louder than others, some mics are somewhat distorted, some don't come through much at all.
For years, this concert has been circulating on film, from scratchy prints, missing the last song, ""Long Tall Sally"". However, a few years ago, the original video tape was located, and if it is used for this DVD, the picture and sound should leap up by quite a notch.
Portions of the videotape were used for Beatles Anthology, I'd suggest you have a look at that, and see if the footage meets the standards you mention. What I will say is, this is historic footage, representing The Beatles' first full concert in the USA, and despite it's flaws, it's a very energetic, exciting performance.",1060819200,19,862,4.567741935483871
8510524,1,B0075BT64S,"Set aside the video quality.  It is awful, but that's not surprising.

This is clever misrepresentation and deceit.  Misrepresentation because the videos included are a collection of excerpts from trailers and such, with very little from the concert itself.  And the timing?  40 minutes.  That's deceit; approximately the length of the concert.  I know.  I was there; part of the video production crew.

If you're looking for a copy of the concert, this isn't it.

BTW: misrepresentation by an expert entity or one in a position to know the truth about a matter is one definition of fraud.",1390003200,11,589,4.918367346938775

If you want to see a tantalizing peek at the original master videotape of this broadcast.... check out the Beatles Anthology DVD set.

This DVD is unofficial, disorganized, and all around bad.  Only nine of the twelve songs are featured, which is just inexcusable, especially considering that the Beatles only played for 30 minutes in the first place!  And the quality of the DVD leaves a lot to be desired as well.

The Beatles are my favorite band, and do not deserve this kind of treatment.  Do yourself a favor and seek out ""The Beatles Unauthorized"" or ""The First US Visit,"" and hear what the concert should sound like.",1154476800,3,720,4.442748091603053

At least four songs are missing -- including ""Long Tall Sally,"" which is featured on the bootleg versions of the show.  They released the complete 1964 Ed Sullivan Shows, why can't they release the complete Washington show?  The packaging looks really nice, but that's why we don't judge books by covers.

Mainly, it's missing songs (""This Boy"", for one; what's up with that?), and it's unnecessarily chopped up into segments, which destroys the continuity of the concert.

But nobody has mentioned one of it's biggest faults; that being that it plays too slow, and therefore, the music is out of pitch. The Beatles certainly didn't sound like that!

I have a couple of bootleg versions of this concert, but my curiousity got the better of me and I decided to buy this DVD.

I wish I hadn't.

However, I will say one thing for it (and it pains me to say this, because I think this thing is a rip-off) the audio is slightly better than I've heard it from other bootleg sources.

If only the thing was complete, I could extract the audio, speed it up, and sync it with a bootleg version that has a better picture, and...oh well, I still don't know if it would be worth the trouble. It would be like trying to put lipstick on a pig.
