5621504,4,B00BHLTJ0S,"This series is generally good, but it white washes blunders made by British and American intelligence. One example is that the German generals wanted to know if the Allies would stop the war if they killed Hitler and stopped the war from their side. This series fails to report this information and says that the Allies ignoring the advances of the generals was no loss because there was no armed resistance units in Germany. This is illogical. It was the generals that would stop the war, not armed groups fighting against a government that was continuing the war.
Another problem is that they do not give credit to assistance they got from other countries. Polish intelligence obtained an enigma machine and set their engineers and mathematicians to analyze it several years before the war. They gave the machine and the analysis results to the British. This series gives all of the code breaking credit to the British.
Yet another thing is that A. J. P. Taylor, the famous war historian, said that the cost of running SOE was vastly more than the value of damage done to the German war effort. It was a misuse of scarce resources.",1366502400,2,1133,4.7272727272727275
5621505,4,B00BHLTJ0S,"This review pertains to the 26 episode European PAL release by Fremantle.

These 26 engaging episodes focuses mainly on military intelligence and goes beyond the usual leaden re-hash of the average war documentary. They are knowledgeably written, intelligently produced, and narrated with great poise and timing by  Charlton Heston.

Greatly contributing to the overall authority and credibility are the many neatly interlaced rostrum inserts from knowledgeable specialists.

The transfer quality is top grade for std DVD, and nicely uniform over the varying archival and material  -  a lot of which is rare.

Some of the episodes, mainly those concerning the Nazi period, unfortunately still have the tiresome demonizing of the enemy - but as they say, the victors write the history.

Nonetheless, unquestionably excellent and thought provoking material.",1363824000,10,855,5.625

8568597,4,B00BHLTJ0S,"This dvd was informative.  I had not seen this footage before or read about most of these espionage incidents.  This had only 10 episodes on it, but I thought it was worth the price and the time to watch it so would recommend it accordingly.

8568598,5,B00BHLTJ0S,"If you are a student of WWII history, than this collection is for you. From the very beginning of the Nazi Party through in-depth looks at the Gulf War and the bombing of Iraq, it leaves nothing to the imagination. And might I add, not being a fan of Charlton Heston, an NRA Spokesperson, he did a credible job on his narration of this series. I could sit here and write detail after detail of this collection but why read what I think of it when you can have it for yourself. You will love and cherish this series.",1404259200,,515,4.212121212121212
