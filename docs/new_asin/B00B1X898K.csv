8561147,4,B00B1X898K,"Much of this, if not all, is available around the net, but it's nice to have a physical copy of the documentation of Commodore's demise.  The video quality is terrible, but that's to be expected, as this was shot on mid-nineties home video.  The content is one-of-a-kind.  If you're a huge Amiga fan and were saddened when it all fell to pieces, this is worth collecting.",1480723200,,371,4.590909090909091
8561148,5,B00B1X898K,"A piece of computing history that's well worth grabbing if you've either grown up with or worked with these machines. I really wish someone had documented the demise of MOS Technologies in the same way.

The video quality is as you'd expect from the era, but certainly watchable, and the audio remastering job is pretty good.",1458086400,,325,4.803571428571429
8561149,4,B00B1X898K,"It's got everything that Dave put up on the Amiga Forever discs (available from Cloanto), and some extra stuff as well. It's worth it's price for being a piece of the machine's history, and from a first-hand perspective at that.",1426550400,,228,4.725
8561150,5,B00B1X898K,"Had a pirated copy for some time and just had to have the real thing.  Glad I got.  Haven't used an Amiga in years, but as I am in IT it will always be a part of me.  Never have used another OS that was as elegant.",1426377600,2,214,3.5106382978723403
8561151,5,B00B1X898K,"The last days of Commodore. What a sad story and such a waste of technology and talent. Oh shame on you Commodore management.
 Dave Haynies video showing the final days of commodore, the lay off party and music and chat from the former employees.

A moment in history.

what a waste.",1416960000,,283,4.509803921568627
8561152,4,B00B1X898K,It's about the Amiga from the God himself. Or one of the Gods anyway. For us who grew up with this wonderful piece of hardware it's really nice to have,1411862400,,151,4.066666666666666
8561153,5,B00B1X898K,"An excellent insiders look at the demise of the Commodore Amiga.  It puts a very human face on the people that made up the company and the frustration with the apparently poor business decisions made by the leadership.  It is done in sort of a 'home documentary' style, and the production techniques may seem dated to anyone born in the past couple of decades, but it is a very well done work considering the technology of the time.",1391126400,,432,4.5256410256410255
8561154,4,B00B1X898K,"An enjoyable but sad look at the last days of C=

Really made me mad at just how dumb C= management was seeing the once great company on it's last legs - a must see for any C= fan.",1366156800,4,180,3.6153846153846154
