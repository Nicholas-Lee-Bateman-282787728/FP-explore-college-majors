662658,5,6303471099,"Okay, he is a goofball. He is an easy target to make fun of. And this series is just fun to do. I started using these in the 80's with my cousin and we loved it. We grew up and moved apart and one day I just decided to see if it was still available and it was. Best of all, I still remembered all of the routines. You can't help but laugh as you use them...laugh at Richard, laugh at the people in the class...but it isn't your typical leotard-clad stick figure that you can't possibly keep up with. It is real people of all sizes participating. The lip syncing is exceptionally bad and laugh worthy. It's nice to add a little variety to your workout.",1499299200,,651,4.133858267716535

Especially love that there are sections of stretching, lightweight hand weight use, and floor work (crunches etc.), all to music.  I first followed the workout on-line for free, which made me decide I had to have it for my own :)  Before this workout, I mostly worked out for 15 minutes in a row tops, but this makes an hour fly by!",1495584000,,502,4.308510638297872

I love the music and that is one of the reasons I bought this.  However, I should have bought the original tape first.  You had to stop and take your pulse to see if you were ""in the target range.""  Nowhere did it explain how to get your target range, and there was nothing included with the DVD.  Maybe they explain this in the first one.  This was a little fast for me.  I am not a good dancer, and by the time I think I figured out the move, they had moved on to another one.  Sometimes I just get moving because I couldn't get what they were doing.  Maybe I'll eventually get the hang of it.  I did make it through the entire DVD.  Next day I was sore, so it was working.  I liked the ending exercises to firm up muscles.  I may order his DVD with the Silver Foxes to see if I can better keep up with it.",1445904000,2,951,3.9682539682539684

I also love that the other people in the video are from a variety of skill levels, sizes, genders and races. It's truly inclusive and body positive.

663594,5,6303471099,"Wish I was old enough to remember when these videos were brand new, and Simmons went on release tours. I think he came to one of our local malls once but I was either a baby, or not born yet (when the first Sweatin came out). Had this on VHS years ago but didn't enjoy doing it as much as 1 and 3. But I now LOVE it and had to get this dvd to go with my 1 and 3 dvds! I love the set they designed for this one--Pops Diner, and all the late 80s fashion/hairdos.(According to Richard it was taped around early October 1989 which is when I was a little baby so that's another reason why I like it). My favorite numbers are The Loco-Motion, Breakin Up is Hard to Do, Windy, Big Girls Don't Cry, Fever, Oh Pretty Woman, and My Boyfriend's Back. I think the hardest song to do was Jailhouse Rock. I found the stretching on the mats (to Aretha Franklin's Rescue Me) to be a bit tough but it was fairly simple and I felt it the next day. I liked doing the triceps exercises with the pop bottles too. I think that's the only time Simmons has done light toning with weights in this series of videos. Simmons is his usual goofball self here (and it's evident during the blooper reel during the credits), but at the same time, he's very motivating and encourages you to keep going and keep your heart up and never give up. I am not overweight by any means but I think I could lose a few pounds and I guess over the years, doing these videos on VHS, I have. This is fun for a rainy day, snowed in, or if I don't feel like going to the gym. 5 stars!",1413158400,,1535,4.019607843137255

Having it here at home and not having to go out to a gym to do the exercise is great - especially since we live quite a distance out of town. I put the DVD on every morning and do a minimum of 15 minutes even if I don't feel like it.  Doing exercise to music is fun!",1412985600,,440,3.8555555555555556

I had tried a few dance workouts before but didn't do well as, unlike cardio, they don't seem to provide a slow examples before kicking butt and making you sweat.  The high reviews led me to get this and I am beyond disappointed.  This might be a GOOD WORKOUT for LOW LEVEL BEGINNERS or INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED LOW IMPACT.  NOT GOOD FOR ADVANCED fitness.  So if you are starting out or can't do high impact then I recommend.  For anyone who can actually run 2 miles.... don't waste your money!",1405814400,2,597,4.422018348623853

It isn't difficult, and most anyone could handle it.  The first few times through, the steps are a little confusing because the cameras change angles, but once you are used to it, it's not a problem.  And truly, you can't beat Richard Simmons.  I  grew up watching him, and he is as dear and sweet in this video as always.  Although these are older videos, the music is great, the moves are great, and Simmons is classic Simmons.  A trifecta of entertainment.

As I said, a great CD for folks that aren't in great shape or just want to have a blast from the past.

I feel better after using # 1 and #2 videos by Richard. I have loss 60 pounds so far.  I love the fun music and Richard makes me feel good.  I will continue to exercise and lose,  with Richard's great videos.  My muscles are sore because I had not exercised.  I was a couch potato before Sweating to the Oldies.  No longer.",1399248000,3,496,4.0625
663725,2,6303471099,"I bought the first Sweatin' to the Oldies on a whim, and discovered I really liked it, so I bought this one. Alas, I didn't like it. In the first Sweatin', Richard Simmons is very excited and fun and just gives out the dance instructions as he goes. In the second one, he tried to be more encouraging, I suppose, but to me it came off as patronizing. He'd say stuff like, ""Come on, you can do it,"" but it didn't sound encouraging, it was just annoying. I just wanted to dance and listen to the music, not have him encourage me like he didn't think I could possibly manage to get up off my butt without his pleading with me to do so.

The dances in this video were more complicated than the first one, and the camera didn't focus on the feet when it should have, so half the time I just bumbled around until I could finally figure out what was going on.

Also, this video was really long. The first video was just the right length of time, but this one had a longer warmup, then the workout, then a bunch of mat work. I know you don't have to do everything all the time, but it was nice with the first Sweatin' to progress from one thing to another fairly quickly, and be done within a half hour or so. Not only does this take longer, but it doesn't get my heartrate up as high as the first one did either.

And maybe this is just me, but the dancers in this video weren't as dynamic as those in the first. The energy just isn't there. Some of them are energetic, yes, but they're not cheering and whooping like they were in the first video.

In other words, Sweatin' to the Oldies 1 was a whole lot of fun. Sweatin' to the Oldies 2 feels like it's trying to be more ""professional"" or more physically thorough or adhere to some sort of guidelines or something. The first one was just fun, people having fun; the second was people exercising.",1398902400,5,1840,4.1892655367231635

Ikeep the aerobic very low impact with no running, jumping, & bouncing, nor do I do quick turns & yet the workout is effective & doable. I enjoy the aerobic portion; however, I do my own floor exercises that I know that I can safely do.  Most importantly I am loosing some weight, toning up, & feeling healthier.

It gets my heart rate up as much as walking 4 miles in l hour (which I do 3 times a week also).  I know, because I wear a monitor for both modalities.

Not only do you have the fun cardio dance routines, but you get some strength training and floor work, as well. None of the other videos do this, unfortunately. If I had one complaint with Richard's videos, it would be that he doesn't put enough focus on these areas (especially strength training). But ""Sweatin' 2"" has great new songs (we move from the prom to Pop's diner this time) and the dance steps are just as easy. Again, as I said in my other reviews, you have to take the time to learn them first, but it is worth it once you do! If you liked ""Sweatin' 1,"" then you will also love this.

Well the songs on the video sounded good. However when I put on the DVD it there was no instructions on how to do the moves. It seemed that Richard was just winging it as he listened to the music, free style so to speak.

If you are like me and need instructions and easy  to follow routines, I would not recommend this for you. If you just like to dance and don't care about how to do the specific movements then get this one. Richard is funny and energetic.",1326931200,3,676,4.106060606060606
664164,5,6303471099,"I remember Richard Simmons from my youth, when I never needed anything of the kind...Now I am at midlife, 80-100 pounds too heavy, and dealing with inflammatory arthritis.  I have been mostly sedentary for years.  I bought this dvd, and I am using it regularly now and really seeing benefits.  I started out doing the workout just every third or fourth day, and at first some of the moves were a problem.  I developed adaptations for those moves (I don't move on diagonals--too much strain for the knees), rested, and then started over.  Now I am doing the full workout every second day, and I have added weights for most of the arm stuff.  As someone who was once a dancer, I can say that this is a good, complete workout:  I am improving all over.  You do a warm-up, gentle stretches, 25 minutes of aerobics at varying intensity, and then strength work for the major muscle groups, before a cool-down.  I am beginning to feel like I'm in my own body, and becoming hopeful that I'll really lose the weight.  I am shopping for more Richard today.

664166,3,6303471099,"I love Richard and often go to his Saturday classes, and I must say that this video is perfect for beginners. I'm about 5'5"" and 120 lbs but hadn't worked out in a couple years. I have to say that I barely felt the work out after the first week. I can imagine that if someone just needs the motivation to get up and work or is slightly overweight and needs low impact, this is perfect. But for me, it stopped being effective after using it for about a week.

Richard's instruction is helpful and he tries to keep things fun and light. The only problem is for someone seeking a bit tougher of a workout, this will not satisfy. It is your basic low level aerobics. So if you are looking for an excuse to get up and move but not necessarily get a great workout in, then I recommend it. But don't get this if you need an intense burn.

Also, I do recommend this over his other general aerobics. He adds some arm work and ab work in this video and if you do them with weights, you can get a decent burn going.  Overall this is my ""break"" video for when I don't feel like doing a hard work out but still want to move. I've liked it for that purpose.",1308355200,5,1143,4.071111111111111
