8027122,4,B0002E9686,"True to life story of a kid from Bensonhurst, who wants to be an actor, but is caught up in the rackets.  Well acted all around, William DeMeo as Tony, Frank Adonis as Crazy Sal, and Ernest Mingione as Johnny command the screen.  The viewer wants to see what these compelling figures will do next.  Burt Young in a cameo, reminds us what a great actor he is. A little bit of Hollywood boy meets girl is thrown into the mix. The ending is surprising, but strangely gratifying.",1158969600,,475,4.375
