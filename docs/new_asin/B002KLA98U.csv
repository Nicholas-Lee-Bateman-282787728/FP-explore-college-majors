8463990,5,B002KLA98U,"John Miller - spoken highly about in other reviews - provides another winner for those interested in and  learning country blues guitar. A special gift of Miller's is to discern the unusual, the more obscure artist and song and bring it to life and give it an importance. On any first listening to some of these songs  without the benefit of Miller's special interest in them and instruction of them, it would be possible to not feel any thing particularly special about them. Miller, with his musical gift of discerning listening and then to relay this discernment to the learner enables some of these songs to really grow on you and they provide the framework for personal  building in of variations or embellishments and for helping with other tunes.",1315267200,,753,4.821705426356589
8463991,5,B002KLA98U,"John Miller is a patient, talented guitar teacher.  As is the norm, the camera work is terrific and the pause button remains my best friend.  What makes this just a bit different is the persona of the teacher.
Many DVDs showcase the talent of the player, but not all are instructional.  John Miller has a very low key approach to teaching and like all talented teachers, he explains things carefully, and anticipates students' struggles, and will focus in upon them. I have most all (or, at least I think all) of John Miller's instructional DVDs and there is no doubt that he is improving with age.  The song selection is terrific, and I think this DVD compliments his others, including Furry Lewis.  I would also recommend Miller's DVDs on Mississippi John Hurt and Woody Mann's DVDs on Big Bill Broomzy and Blind Boy Blake. Taken together, these DVDs represent many months, if not a full year, of ""private instruction"" at a fraction of the cost.",1261353600,,947,4.715151515151515
