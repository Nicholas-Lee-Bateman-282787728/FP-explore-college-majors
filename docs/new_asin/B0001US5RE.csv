8016435,5,B0001US5RE,"This is the story of Misaki, she's moved to Tokyo to attend middle school and live with her aunt. On her first day there she sees an ""Angelic Layer"" battle on TV and falls in love with it. In Angelic Layer people compete using dolls they remotely control with their mind to fight. It's a very popular game that has a huge fan base and lots of skilled competitors. Misaki gets an Angel and starts to play Angelic Layer. Through the game she meets lots of new friends and even unlocks secrets about her past, like the true identity of her mother and father.

This anime is mainly a fun & games type show. It has a lot of good lessons to teach about love and friendship with a descent amount of drama, but it's not upsetting drama; it's more fulfilling. I have loved every CLAMP anime I've ever seen and this is no exception. It's not as emotionally heavy as X or Tsubasa, but it's a nice change of pace. It think this is also one you can sit down and watch with the whole family. Young and old can find something charming about this little gem.",1356739200,,1042,4.262626262626263
8016436,4,B0001US5RE,"With only six episodes left, unfortunately ADV has decided to make us wait for it by reducing the number of episodes per disc from four to three spread over two DVD's.  ( A word-to-the-wise here in favor of getting the box set, for sure! )  These three are again not so action-packed, but continue to provide much-needed character background.

Like the previous disc, this one leads off with what is one of my two favorite stories in the entire series.  Both take place away from the Arena, this time for a one-day ""summer holiday"" at the beach.  Misaki, Tamayo, Hotako, and her brother Kotaru all take the bus; unbeknownst to them, all the staff of Angelic Layer also decide to drive down in a van for a barbecue.  This leads to all sorts of humorous complications in a will-they-or-won't-they scenario as the first of the various comings-and-goings occur.  Of course eventually Misaki encounters someone from the ""other party"" in the person of Ohjiro, and then Icchan and Ogata.  An invitation to merge the groups is then innocently made by Ogata, and accepted by Misaki, much to the worry of Icchan.

The subtitle for this episode is ""Someone Is In Love With Someone""; this proves to be a gross understatement, as plot, details, and relationships all thicken, eventually involving just about everyone present!  Of course Misaki remains clueless through much of it: when Kotaro compliments her swimsuit, she assumes he's talking about Hikaru in her matching one.  One of my favorite lines occurs when Misaki first says who she's there with, including Hotako-chan, and Ogata replies: ""You mean Suzuka-Speed-of-Light's here too!""

The other episodes on the disc are a two-parter involving ""dates"" between Misaki and Ohjiro on one hand, and Kotaru and Tamayo on the other; as well as the climactic confrontation of ""The Miracle Rookie"" and ""The Young Nobleman of the Layer"".  Here we recieve the backstory of Ohjiro, his ""brother"" Iijiro, and the woman they both love.  Also Tamayo and Kotaru have to confront how they feel about each other, much to the amusement of Ringo Seto, reintroduced for the climax.  The question here is how Misaki can overcome Wizard's impenatrable new technique, ""Magic Guard"".  ( Sounds like an anti-perspirant! )",1215388800,,2241,4.983870967741935
8016437,5,B0001US5RE,"I have not seen this specific DVD, but I have seen then entire series multiple times as fansubs.  These 3 episodes show more into the past of Wizards Deus, Ojiroh.  These episodes delve into accidental meetings at the beach, an accidental date in tokyo, and the battle between wizard and hikaru.  All three episodes are very good, and the Wizard battle is truly amazing.  I recommend this disk for any fan of the series, it is a must have!",1080518400,2,439,4.518987341772152
