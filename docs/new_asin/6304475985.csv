8643109,5,6304475985,"Webs of Intrigue is the best video on spider diversity and behavior currently available.  It is biologically accurate, filmed well, and funny. Interesting and educational. I have shown this video to my spider biology students for years, and invariably students ask to borrow it to show their friends.  I am only disappointed that it does not come in DVD form.",1314921600,2,359,4.966666666666667
