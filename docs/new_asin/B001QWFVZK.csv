In it,Christy Kenneally tries to ""decode"" or better yet explain several aspects of the Christian faith such as the beliefs,symbols,art,rituals and beliefs. Aside from that,myths and miracles are also investigated. And most of all,it also provided a lot of information about Christian history. It was a great documentary. While it may not fully explain a deep philosophical meanings of the sacred scriptures,it still managed to help the viewer get an understanding of what Christianity and its believers are all about.",1412035200,2,598,5.655555555555556

8336664,4,B001QWFVZK,"This DVD contains 2 discs divided into 6 parts describing the elements of  the Christian religion. There are no extras on the discs and the episodes do not really discuss the beliefs of Christianity so much as its' symbols and history. There are really no comparisons to other religions.
The parts are: 1. Flesh and Blood, giving examples of how Christians throughout the ages have punished their bodies, including some today who reenact the crucifixion 2. Damned and Saved, 3. Angels 4. Secrecy, Symbols & Mystery, this gives no mention of anything related to secret codes of popular fiction, 5. Miracles, 6. A Faith Divided, this deals with mainly how Christianity split in the time of Constantine and Rome, the nature of Christ and the Nicene Creed.
The narration is done well as are the interviews with religious experts. The history of Christianity is the main subject covered here; very little is taken up to the time of today or problems of the Christian religion now. The subject is well covered and would serve as an excellent focus for an historical and basic study of the Christian elements, just do not expect current problems or philosophy to be covered.",1260144000,18,1167,4.864321608040201
