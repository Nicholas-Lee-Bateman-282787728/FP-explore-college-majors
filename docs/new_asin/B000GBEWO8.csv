8130376,5,B000GBEWO8,This movie featuring a young Adrien Brody was excellent! The character he portrayed was so convincing. The story itself was very realistic. All of the actors fit the role they were cast for. I highly recommend Ten Benny.,1384041600,,220,4.815789473684211
8130377,5,B000GBEWO8,"I've watched this movie a dozen times and each time I see it I discover something brilliant about Brody's performance.  It's not just his expressive facial movements, it's his ability to connect with the character and become the character, therefore, pulling the audience in.  He moves in and out of each scene with a style and grace that's hard to find in many of today's elite actors.  How he went virtually unnoticed by many until 'The Pianist' will always puzzle me, but if you're looking for a gritty film, that's true to art and brilliantly acted, see this movie.  Adrian as Ray Jr. is worth the time alone.",1080777600,8,613,4.648148148148148
8130378,5,B000GBEWO8,"Brilliant acting by Adrien Brody as Ray illuminates this gritty look at lower-income blue collar life. Written & directed by New Jersey native Eric Bross, Ten Benny sheds light on the inner wheels of a man pinwheeling into self-destruction.
Ray is trapped in his father's failed past, determined to somehow assuage the mistakes his father made. Driven to find love, acceptance, and redemption through money, Ray ironically relives his father's life, falling prey to his father's mistakes.
As he stumbles towards a disillusioned ecstasy, and consequently hits rock bottom, his closest friends begin to question his moral fiber. They nearly desert him.....
Brody portrays Ray with humility and grace, conveying with his expressive facial features all the torment, desolation, vulnerability, childishness, fear, and loneliness that run wildly through Ray's soul. With each unique gesture and nuance, Brody breathes life into Ray's psyche.
Complimenting Brody's acting include James E. Moriarty (straight-edged loan shark), Tony Gillan (tough-guy best friend), Frank Vincent (Ray Sr, who tries to raise Ray the best he can), Michael Gallagher (sensitive best friend), and the lesser-known Sybil Temchen, who portrays Joanne, Ray's girlfriend. Temchen empowers Joanne with tenacity and strength, providing a formidable, believable match to Brody's insecure Ray.",1059782400,14,1356,5.751243781094527
8130379,5,B000GBEWO8,"I must admit, this movie was only okay.  But the performance by Jay Galione as young Ray was phenominal.  Honestly it is worth your price of admission here.  Jay hasn''t done too much work since the movie but has been busy with his rock band cruising jupiter (dot com) and has recently begun dating Anna Nicole Smith!  I hope he does another movie soon because his performance here is not to be missed.",1029456000,4,402,4.465753424657534
8130380,5,B000GBEWO8,"After watching ""Ten Benny"", I would have to say that Adrien Brody is not another Al Pacino.  He is in a league of his own.  The fact that this young actor is able to demonstrate every emotion just by the  movement of his eyebrows is awe-inspiring.  He played the role of Ray with  vigor and truthfulness, and that is why it was so enjoyable to watch.  Even  when Ray was violent or doing things that were distastefu, you ended up  feeling sympathy simply because of Brody's performance.  I would recommend  this movie to anyone who enjoys watching Al Pacino or Robert DeNiro.  But  to not confuse Adrien Brody's stellar performance as a mere carbon-copy of  those fine actors. He deserves his own credit.",960163200,22,704,4.626016260162602
