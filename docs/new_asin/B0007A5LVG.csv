8046594,4,B0007A5LVG,"I love Victoria Johnson's workout videos.  They always keep me energized and entertained so I don't mind working out for 30 to 40 minutes.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I'm not sure if anyone noticed but there's a portion of the audio where it sounds like someone on a loud speaker is talking over the instructor and it makes it hard to hear her instructions during that part.  I found this on the one I purchased and also on the copy I rented from the library.  Thankfully it only affects about a minute or two of the video.  Also just a heads up -- this workout IS NOT 30 minutes long.  The step portion (minus warm up and strength training) is about 35 minutes.  Then if you add the warm up, strength training and cool down you're looking at a 50 minute work out (which suits me just fine)",1463702400,,802,4.2026143790849675
8046595,3,B0007A5LVG,I have an old VHS of Victoria's Stepping in Shape and I love it.  I bought this thinking I was getting similar quality but with a more convenient DVD.  The work out is great but the quality of the DVD is not -- several times throughout the workout you can hear a man's voice giving commands that overlap Victoria's instruction.  It's very distracting and frustrating.,1440892800,,367,4.615384615384615
