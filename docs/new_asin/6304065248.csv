8219564,5,6304065248,"Homeroom Affairs is an erotic comedy focusing on the forbidden fruit situation that Tokiro Ehara has gotten himself into.  Actually, his problem isn't really his doing as Miyako is simply an irrepressible 18-year old coed with a mind of her own.  Tokiro is a new teacher at an elite all-girl high school in Tokyo.  Miyako's father asks Tokiro to watch over his daughter, but Tokiro just has to wonder, who's teaching whom?  The video uses innuendo and fan service liberally but very carefully in order to maintain a tightly scripted plot.  This is genuinely a tastefully done video with a nice ending.  The video quality is bright, stable, and is happily one of those ""perfect"" VHS transfers.  Video ISBN 0-9643573-0-5.  It's licensed from Hakusensha Publishing through Jam Creation and is distributed by Star Anime Enterprises with production number SAE-001, so this show is obviously their very first creation for the English market.
The video is based on characters that originally appeared as the series ""Tanin no Kankei"" by Ichiro Arima.  It appeared in Young Animal Magazine around 1993 and 1994.  There are two much more detailed individual manga from that time period with a number of other humourous plots into which Miyako manages to tease Tokiro immensely.  You may also find more references to this show on the web if you search for ""Tanin no Kankei"" instead of Homeroom Affairs.",989712000,,1391,5.004347826086956
