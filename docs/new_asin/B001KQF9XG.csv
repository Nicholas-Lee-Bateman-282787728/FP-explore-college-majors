8344306,3,B001KQF9XG,"Karthik is an orphan who does all kinds of odd jobs at 'Rojavanam', an old people's home. He is well-liked by all the old people there. Laila is the owner's daughter, who comes from abroad. Karthik falls in love with her and some of the old people in the home (M.S.V., Nambiar, Kaka Radhakrishnan, Jaiganesh,Manorama, etc.) set up some instances to make Laila also fall in love with Karthik and they succeed in this venture. But, as expected, Laila has a 'murai mappillai'. If Laila refuses to marry the 'murai Laila and Karthik in Roja Vanammappillai', then Rojavanam would be demolished. So, Karthik does a 'thyaagam' and sacrifices his love for the sake of the old people.",1301961600,,675,4.777777777777778
