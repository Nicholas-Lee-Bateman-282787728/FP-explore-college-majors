5510474,1,B00AUMMYZW,Mean spirited and not funny in any way.  I usually love British television of all genres.  I couldn't stand this show.,1376524800,6,118,4.571428571428571
5510475,5,B00AUMMYZW,"After the detailed review by my fellow Top 100 Amazon Reviewer, K Harris, I can't add much more as I'd be repeating him but - as he said - this is the ""real thing"" with all the graphic language of the BBC original and hilarious scenes plus LOTS of bonuses - commentaries, specials, etc.

I will say that it is much closer to The Office than any other BBC comedy (like Fawly Towers), especially in the camera technique. When you watch even the first 15 minutes you will recognize the technique: The hand held camera. And, to be honest, that is not for everyone. It jumps and jitters - even more than in The Office, I think - and might give folks a headache (that is if the laughter doesn't take your mind away from it.). So,, while I can heartly recommend the set, I'll suggest that you watch a preview before going for the whole set.

But aside from the above warning,  I found the show a great satire on  government politics - in a completely different way from the BBC's ""House of Cards"". Now, let's see how long before US TV makes an American version, as they did for The Office.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5510476,5,B00AUMMYZW,"This show can probably be best thought of as ""The Office"" + ""The West Wing"" + about a million curse words. It relates goings-on in a minor British government department (Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship, or ""DOSAC"") as they deal with (usually self-created) crises of one sort or another. While the characters would like to do good, they have no resources and so their main concern on a daily basis is usually to avoid blame for the things they do wrong, specifically to avoid having to deal with Peter Capaldi, the hilariously profane representative of the Prime Minister.

What's good: The language is very funny. Since this is a DVD copy, you can put on subtitles, which trust me are very helpful when characters start insulting each other especially. It's (finally!) on region 1 DVDs; US and Canadian viewers no longer need to convert from U.K. discs.

What's bad: The first episode is comparatively simplistic and obvious. Power through that, and I promise the rest are better. Lots of naughty language; if that is likely to bother you, stay away.

My wife and I discovered this show after watching the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-The-Loop/dp/B0038BH3LC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In The Loop</a>.

5510477,5,B00AUMMYZW,"The ""Fawlty Towers"" of this Century. A symphony of fowl-mouthed British politicians and their toadies.

I never heard of ""thick of it"" prior to purchasing it, however, so I was a little put off by the camera techniques until I got used to it (about 15 minutes into first episode).  Then, both my husband and I were laughing our heads off.  British humour (absolutely had to spell it that way!) is perfect.  Their way of making fun of politics is just great.

I haven't watched all the disks yet, and there are two disks called Season Two with same picture on it (no volume one, or volume two written on it), so I'm unsure whether or not I need to request a replacement.

5510487,5,B00AUMMYZW,"If you're one of those tender souls who can't abide a bit of harsh language, then you'd better leave now.  This is perhaps the most hilariously profane show ever made.  It appears that BBC took a while to realize what a gem they had, with a pair of abbreviated first seasons, followed by a longer committment over the final two seasons.

It's a show about managing cabinet ministers in the UK, with Peter Capaldi as a spin doctor talking out of both sides of his mouth.  He cajoles, undercuts and humilates staff and clueless politicians alike. Somehow it's usually the right thing for his party, but his ethical compass will spin wildly while he's doing it.  Casting of the show as a whole is pitch-perfect. The producers apparently even used profanity consultants to craft the most ingeniously foul remarks ever uttered.  The actors contributed plenty of their own as you can see from the many alternate scenes included with the set.

As good as the casting is, the show belongs to Peter Capaldi.  He's great in Doctor Who, but this will always be the role that comes to mind for me.  He can turn on a dime, from scathing to confiding, from slapstick to terrifying.  And 'The Thick of It"", clearly shows why American comedy is always playing catch-up.",1451606400,12,1253,4.680365296803653

5510493,5,B00AUMMYZW,"I really like this show.  I bought it on a whim as I like to try different British comedies.  The humor is not Father Ted or IT Crowd style which I love, but is subtle, sarcastic, and sometimes I wonder if they're trying to be funny or if it's just a result of portraying the inner workings of government.  Either way I find it extremely engaging and count it an excellent find that I will watch multiple times.  Some may not care for the strong language, doesn't bother me and is part of the government caricature that makes the show both humorous and compelling.",1433548800,2,564,4.394230769230769

They are prodded on by the spin doctor from hell (Peter Capaldi) who rapid-fires lines and hilarity with a surgeon's precision. The format is fly-on-the-wall; we spy on the inner workings of a seriously scary-if-even-close-to-true voted-in puppets. The talking is fast and the stories from any-country headlines. It's a political comedy, yes, but also very much more. Kindred spirit of The Office mixed with West Wing folded into House of Cards (British and American version). I was thankful I had the dvd so I could rewind (frequently) either due to laughing so hard I missed the next scene, or missing a rant due to ""the accent"" - totally worth the effort for entertainment value.

5510499,5,B00AUMMYZW,"as many have said a wicked and relentless SATIRE of government insiders, and satire, irony by exaggeration, as comment on this kind of use of language. that is why it makes me laugh, not because lots of ""bad"" words are being used.",1426982400,2,230,4.5
5510500,5,B00AUMMYZW,"It's true. However, I was so enthralled by Peter Capaldi's performance in the film ""In the Loop,"" that I couldn't very well avoid ""Thick of It."" In that sense, you don't have to be a current affairs junkie or a political animal to enjoy a series such as this, but make no mistake, this show places you up to your neck in behind-the-scenes political maneuvering in London.

The writing is rapid-fire, the dialogue is as funny as it is raucously quick-witted and the plots are a riot on their own. The 4 seasons of the show center around the respective offices of politicians: Hugh Abbot (played by Chris Langham), Peter Mannion (played by one of my all-time English favs, Roger Allam) and Nicola Murray (played by the elegantly-beautiful Rebecca Front). To say all three of these politicians is the very picture of sheltered incompetence would be an understatement. Allam, Langham and Front were brilliantly cast as their fumbling and shambolic characters were a hilarious display of stiff awkwardness.

The unbridled highlight is Capaldi's Malcolm Tucker, who is one television's greatest, most striking characters ever portrayed. It's the sort of character that you'll cringe 30 years down the road if/when someone tries to remake the series with some new actor playing Tucker. Tucker's richly-imaginative manner of verbal berating is the stuff of legend. I mean Capaldi put every ounce of his energy into cutting fellow public servants down to size. Personally, I don't shy from vulgarity and oh my God, does Malcolm launch it. Mr. Tucker has raised cursing and insulting to an art form.

My only disappointment with the series -- besides a dour ending -- was that fellow Scottish Assassin ""Jamie"" (played perfectly sociopathic by Paul Higgins) only featured a handful of times. I don't know about fellow fans of ""In the Loop,"" but I was ECSTATIC when I discovered he was featured on the show again. I'm not usually drawn to frenetic shows/films with raging characters hurling threats and insults at others to prompt results, but the Jamie-Malcom duo is so hilarious, it can't even draw a comparison.

""Thick of It"" is more than just ""worth the price of admission."" It is a bonafide classic and a wholly unique show.",1425686400,5,2218,4.954301075268817

Peter Capaldi, who was so very sweet in the movie, ""Local Hero"", has become a very versatile actor. He can rage, rant, and spit verbal venom with the best of them. He's perfect for this part.

5510507,5,B00AUMMYZW,"The Thick of It (2008, BBC comedy series) was written and directed by Armando Ianucci, the brilliant offspring of Italian-Scot parents, who wrote and directed the compelling (if not scathing) 2009 satire, In the Loop [...], which featured many of the same familiar characters viz. Peter Capaldi as Parliament whip Malcolm Tucker and Tom Hollander (as Minister of International Deveopment Simon Foster).  Both the BBC comedy series and the feature film that followed it are characterized by Capaldi's in-your-face put-downs as well as the persistent squabbling and incompetence of British politicians.  Political comedy in the United States is characterized by stand-up (Louis Black, Louis C.K., Bill Maher, et.al.) and has none of Ianucci's biting realism.  (Full disclosure: he also created the HBO series, Veep, which is in the same vein but is much tamer.)  Ianucci's humor is a direct descendant of staple British satire, from Beyond the Fringe to Monty Python.  It's a keeper.",1412553600,4,981,5.3441558441558445

What I did not know, however, was the extent of the awful language.  This was a BBC-2 TV Series, supposedly the ""upscale"" network.  The disgraceful, and non-ending foul language over-shadowed everying else in this Series.  I could not concentrate on any story - also a shame because of the good actors involved - because I was too busy saying ""was that really necessary?"".

5510512,5,B00AUMMYZW,"This show would be on my  short list of the most hilarious TV series I have ever seen.  Part farce, part satire, it skewers everyone associated with politics.  The diarrhea of profanity I think somewhat obscures just how clever and spot-on this series is.  While there are references that probably only the British would recognize, that doesn't lessen the appreciation of being thoroughly entertained by the constant flow of cutting observant dialog and outlandishly amusing behavior.

Every episode has its outstanding moments, but the sixth one of the final season--the inquiry episode--is something else.

The writing is excellent, the cast stellar, and Peter Capaldi's performance as Malcolm Tucker, the Darth Vader of spin doctors,  will not soon be forgotten.  Btw, Armando Iannucci, the creator of The Thick of It, has gone on to helm the HBO series Veep, another hilarious political satire.",1401753600,3,898,5.274647887323944

5510517,5,B00AUMMYZW,"The Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship (DoSAC) is a key government body with wide-ranging responsibilities on a number of different issues. However, the minister in charge of the department is constrained, bewildered and kept on the hop by a prime minister who can't go five minutes without changing his mind and by a variety of mishaps. Luckily, the party's chief spin-doctor Malcolm Tucker is on hand to keep them on-track with a barrage of swearing and formidable powers of media manipulation.

The Thick of It is a British drama-comedy that aired for four seasons and two hour-long specials, irregularly scheduled between 2005 and 2012. It was created by political satirist and comedian Armando Iannucci and has a constantly-evolving cast and scope. The first two seasons (of just three episodes each) are tightly focused on DoSAC minister Hugh Abbot (Chris Langham), his advisors Ollie Reeder (Chris Addison) and Glen Cullen (James Smith), his director of communications Terri Coverley (Joanna Scanlan) and, of course, the formidable Malcolm Tucker (a masterful performance by Peter Capaldi). The success of the early episodes opened up the scale of the show and more castmembers were added, including the shadow DoSAC department run by the opposition party and led by Peter Mannion (Roger Allam). Langham's departure under controversial, off-screen circumstances led to his replacement by Nicola Murray (Rebecca Front), a backbencher so obscure that even the detail-oriented Tucker doesn't know who she is.

The Thick of It is filmed with handheld cameras to give a semi-documentary, urgent feel to events and much of the dialogue is improvised to help with this feeling, although  there is a script which acts a guide. The show makes a point of never saying which party which character works for, although it's quite clear that the party in government in the first three seasons is Labour and the coalition in the final season is between the Tories and Liberal Democrats. Notably, the final season posits an alternate reality where David Miliband ('Daniel Miller') takes over as Labour leader and is immediately regarded as a key threat by his opponents.

The show is mostly comedic, with early storylines revolving around the incompetence of the minister and his staff, usually creating a PR catastrophe that Tucker has to solve through the use of clever media tactics and chewing out the team with a spectacular eruption of creative and sustained invective. This format starts to tire a little, but the show seems aware of this and changes things up, featuring episodes more revolving around political conspiracies and internal power struggles. The final season features a change of focus, with the opposition now in power and Tucker (after a monumental battle for his career in the third season) consigned to helping guide his party back into power. The show also features moments of drama and pathos, most notably revolving around Tucker's undermining in the third season and a more serious subplot in the final season about the death of a nurse and how the parties seek to cynically use it for their own ends.

Most of the plaudits bestowed on The Thick of It are well-deserved. The acting is excellent from everyone, although it has to be said that both Capaldi and Roger Allam (whose compromised but well-meaning code of honour makes him the most likable character on the show, which isn't saying much) rise above the pack. The dialogue, whether scripted or improvised, is sharp and quickly-delivered and the storylines are fairly intricate. Events often spin on a single line of dialogue or an innocuous-looking phone call that backfires later on, so some attention to detail is required.

If the show has a weakness, it's that the constant tone of cynicism can at times be wearying. Yes, politics is a dirty game and even the most well-meaning, idealistic young politician probably does become despairing and sarcastic about the whole thing after a few years, but the near-total absence of any sympathetic characters (particularly in the final season, when everyone really is out for themselves) feels like it's going overboard. The constant level of incompetence from the characters also feels a little unbelievable after a while, with it being implausible that these characters could keep their jobs after even one of the 'omnishambles' that takes place, let alone dozens. Veep (made by such the same team), which can be seen as an American mirror to The Thick of It, handles this rather better by showing some of the characters to be at least basically competent in their roles and the disasters not being quite as catastrophic.

Still, these issues are made up for the sharp humour and extremely strong performances. The Thick of It (****) is the strongest British political comedy since Yes, Minister and is unrelenting in its mockery of some very silly institutions that nevertheless control the country. The series is available on DVD in the UK and USA now.",1391558400,5,4990,5.100367197062424
5510518,5,B00AUMMYZW,"You know what, this series is so funny that there's actually very little point in anything else.

It's about what goes on behind the scenes in a British political party, with stories ranging from a new minister's daughter going to a private school rather than a comprehensive (what USA calls public schools) to an aide's girlfriend stealing policy for her own (opposing) boss, to the party having to deal with bolshie members of the public.

Peter Capaldi's MONSTROUS Malcolm Tucker, the scariest, cleverest, most inventively profane man in the entire world, is the Prime Minister's spin-doctor, clearing up messes and scheming and hatcheting, is a total joy.  (Fans have had great fun making up lines for him in his new role as Doctor Who, ie: 'Get in the F-ing Tardis, Ron f-ing Waesley's love-child with a f-ing Care-Bear, or I'll eat you, sick you up and grout my f-ing bathroom with you!').  Joanna Scanlan is lovely as the useless civil servant who knows no-one can touch her job, Chris Addison (Ollie Reeder) is the aide trying, on unfeasibly long legs, to catch up (my sis calls him The Claygo Worm).

I throw flowers at the feet of Paul Higgins, who plays Jamie ""Shut It!"" McDonald, arguably even scarier a Scot than Malcolm Tucker, his boss - younger and more in favour of 'a pub fight' rather than 'Oxford pleasantries'.

Rebecca Front is spot-on as hapless minister Nicola Murray, who gets the job that no-one wants and messes up every step along the way.  Malcolm's insults to her are priceless.  James Smith plays senior policy adviser Glenn Cullen beautifully, taking a barrage of insults from both Malcolm and Ollie.

The strength of ITTOI is that there are so many brilliant characters, minor and lead, for instance: Polly Kemp as clueless, perpetually-worried Robyn, with her ghastly Sloane hairband. Stewart Pearson, the horrendous opposition spin-doctor, with his teeth-curdling management-speak and stupid ideas-generating games.  Cal Richards, Stewart's tiny, psychotic boss.  Creepy, probably psychotic Fleming, Malcolm's holiday-cover, with his improbable chin and inappropriate reactions.  Ah, and Julius.  The divinely civilized Julius, the Right Hon. Lord Nicholson of Arnage, adviser to the PM, always eating something lovely and listening to cricket, refusing to rise to Malcolm's foul language (he says 'f' instead, bless him) .  It's a travesty when Jamie is disrespectful to him!

It's quite eerie to hear some of the lines given to Chris Langham, as minister Hugh Abbott, in view of his speedy disappearance after the real-life unsavoury charges against him, but the series doesn't miss a step without him.

Oh, and who could forget Blinky Ben!

I could go on and list the whole lot of them, because they are all wonderful creations.  Instead, I'll end with:

Beautifully written and acted, this is complete TV joy.  If you like clever comedy, aren't afraid of ceaseless bad language and want to see Peter Capaldi before he goes all child-friendly, this is one for you.",1391126400,13,3002,5.075356415478615
5510519,5,B00AUMMYZW,"If you liked the film ""In The Loop"", then you'll love this entirely British spinoff.  I saw this series on Hulu and it was so worth it.  The characters are just great and the script is pulsating as a gritty and sometimes hilarious tennis match.",1390003200,2,244,4.4
5510520,5,B00AUMMYZW,"Capaldi is a genius in this. A great satire, showing everything that's wrong with politics today. Veep isn't nearly as good.",1389657600,,124,4.9523809523809526
5510521,5,B00AUMMYZW,"This series doesn't pull any punches.  Anyone who has worked in government, or a large corporation, will recognize the themes of everyone looking out for their own interests, and measuring success by counting the knives they'd stabbed people in the back with.  The language is raw, but it is what is often heard behind the scenes in hallway meetings.  Just about every character is delightfully despicable, forming alliances when convenient, and quick to turn against others when it looks like that other person is not going to help your career.",1389052800,2,545,5.033333333333333
5510522,5,B00AUMMYZW,"Absolutely amazing show. It is very funny, but the final episodes get pretty serious.

For a show about politics it never says which side of the isle it is on. It plays both sides evenly. I liked and loathed characters from both sides.

I can't help but think that this show is pretty accurate in its portrayal of politicians.",1386633600,,326,4.508474576271187
5510523,5,B00AUMMYZW,"Despite the foul language which is mostly quite clever, this show is wickedly funny and well acted all around. It must be seen to be believed.",1381363200,,142,4.5
5510524,1,B00AUMMYZW,"Sent to my brother in Cape Cod, and the DVD Player he has would play the advertising material at the beginning, but refused him permission to play the actual series. A replacement disc did exactly the same. A pity; I know the series to be outstandingly good - if you have that sort of sense of humour!",1381017600,,301,4.298245614035087
5510525,5,B00AUMMYZW,Satirical comedy of the working of the British govt and the spin doctor that tries to keep it all together. I have watched many clips of this online. There is no other way to watch this in the US. So finally decided I must have my own. This is all 4 seasons plus 2 specials. Excellent.  If you are averse to colorful language ( swear words) then stay away ...but Malcolm's filthy mouth makes it work.  Too funny for words but also the irony of the convoluted workings of a/the government is priceless,1380672000,,500,4.365591397849462
5510526,5,B00AUMMYZW,"If you've love (or even like) ""Veep,"" and ""In the Loop,"" satire, you'll love this.  Peter Capaldi is smart and very funny.  And I love the dvd 'cause you can see it on your own time -- or as many times as you like.",1378598400,7,214,3.840909090909091
5510527,5,B00AUMMYZW,"The new Doctor, in his old role...TOO FUNNY FOR WORDS!! Loads of expletives flying, and tremendous British humor. It's a side-splitting, rip-roaring funny quad of discs which will have you rolling through time and space!! Enjoy!!",1378339200,3,229,5.388888888888889
5510528,1,B00AUMMYZW,"stipid movie, think the camera man was drunk made me dissy trying to watch it, what a joke of a movie.",1377993600,2,102,3.9047619047619047
5510529,5,B00AUMMYZW,"Story about a fictional governmental department that is so typical of many of the real things today.  The writing is sharp and quick (thank goodness for subtitles) and the humor is wonderfully sarcastic.  Be prepared to suspend your dislike of profanity for a while.  The language is harsh, but as you get into the series you don't even notice it and don't feel the usual uncomfortable feeling normally associated with such language.  One of the best of British TV.",1377561600,4,465,4.848101265822785
5510530,4,B00AUMMYZW,"I can't say much more about this superlative, black political satire from Britain that other reviewers haven't already said about this alleged behind the scenes look at the UK government's ""Department of Social Affairs"".  The fairly brief episodes revolve around the miseries and predicaments of the Minister for Social Affairs and his/her hapless staff, particularly its PR machine. There are actually two Ministries for Social Affairs: one for the party in power and the other the ""shadow"" version. Americans may get confused by this if they don't know that in the UK, the ""opposition"" party, the one NOT In power, forms a cabinet that mirrors, or ""shadows"" the cabinet of the party in power - thus, the ""shadow cabinet"" and ""shadow ministers"".  It's not hard to figure out which office/cast members are parodying the Labour and which the Tory parties. Equally mendacious, feckless, and amoral, one of the not too subtle points of the show is that it hardly matters which is in power.

The cast is wonderful and, like spokes of a wheel, spin around the Senior Press Officer for the majority party, the notorious Malcolm Tucker: vicious, ruthless, terrifying, and ruling all and sundry with levels of profanity so coarse as to beggar description. Even in more sophisticated Europe, it pulls one up short as you listen to remember that the nearly incessant stream of obscenity that forms the great portion of the writing made it onto mainstream programming.

Tucker is played by the delightful Peter Capaldi, who makes the most of every oath-filled moment. The heart goes out to the rest of the characters trying to share a screen, even a small one, with Capaldi's no-holds-barred Tucker.

I bought this disc and found it to be a Region 1, so if you have US DVD player you should be able to play it, and it does contain ""Rise of the Nutters"" and all the specials.

I cracked a couple of ribs laughing as I watched this, but it's just as well that the episodes are less than a half hour each: it's just about as much at a time as anyone can take of Malcolm Tucker's mouth.

The film ""In the Loop"", with many of the same cast members, including Capaldi, was based on this series. Highly recommend both to all viewers who love political satire of the very blackest hue.",1376784000,9,2266,4.7360406091370555
8557989,5,B00AUMMYZW,Was introduced to the show by a British family member and bought the set because I couldn't ge the show on Netflix. Worth every penny,1530057600,,133,4.36
8557990,5,B00AUMMYZW,These series put a hilarious spin on politics.,1517184000,,46,4.875

8557992,5,B00AUMMYZW,My Review : WONDERFUL !!,1510272000,,24,4.0
8557993,5,B00AUMMYZW,As this is my favorite political comedy I was thrilled to find the entire series in one set. Comes with all 4 seasons including the specials.,1500249600,,141,4.461538461538462
8557994,5,B00AUMMYZW,"Before he was The Doctor, Capaldi was the Spin Doctor - the most foul-mouthed and cunning spin doctor in Britain. This hilarious and scathing look at the world of politics quickly became one of my favorite shows.",1499385600,,212,4.756756756756757
8557995,5,B00AUMMYZW,"Should come with a warning sticker: ""Binge watching this collection will make you snarky.""

 Sorry, forgot sarcasm doesn't play well on the internet.  Kind of like John Wayne Gacy at a convention for clowns and S&M fetish fans.",1498694400,,227,4.921052631578948
8557996,5,B00AUMMYZW,The only thing I will add to these other comments is that the next to last episode is so funny that you have to watch at least twice to know what to look out for the third time (in a row).  One of the best series closers ever.  It took me the first season to really get the rhythm but once you understand how they are doing this (very much like British Office and Fawlty Towers) then it is up there with the best.  Had a good pinch of Little Britain in there too!,1493596800,2,463,3.904255319148936
8557997,5,B00AUMMYZW,"It's almost impossible to keep up with the frenetic pace of the dialogue (both scripted and improvised) in this hysterical BBC series - even with subtitles, which are virtually mandatory to savor every scrumptious nuance of absurdity. Don't over-analyze or try to let reason enter into the proceedings - rather, just let the constant stream of outrageous one-liners and witty verbal assaults cascade over you as you attempt to catch your breath during fits of laughing. Perhaps some references are lost on us non-Brits, but no matter - there are plenty of others to keep all viewers wildly entertained. Brilliantly insane!!",1490400000,,623,5.178217821782178
8557998,5,B00AUMMYZW,I loved the entire series!,1487808000,,26,4.4
