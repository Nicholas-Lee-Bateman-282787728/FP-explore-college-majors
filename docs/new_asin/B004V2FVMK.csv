8442586,4,B004V2FVMK,"Compared to the recent Bollywood films of wealthy young people driving expensive cars, MILI is a much more humble film -- one which centers on an apartment building, where the rooms have not so much decoration & the only place for children to play is the roof garden. A new tenant on the top floor gives us one part of our story, as he is not fond of the idea of kids playing on his balcony; the other part is provided by hints that Mili's health isn't quite what it could be.

This isn't the usual song-and-dance extravaganza -- if I recall correctly, there is only one such sequence -- but instead a quiet family drama. While the relationship between the principals develops, it's more about their daily life: the kids, the neighbors, the family, and everyone working it out. Jaya Bhaduri shines. Recommended for just about anyone.",1428883200,,833,4.628378378378378

8442588,4,B004V2FVMK,"This extraordinary, heart-warming/breaking film is about a young vibrant girl named Mili. Mili is a very bubbly, vivacious, outgoing girl and a very big prankster as well. She spreads happiness with her positive attitude and is popular with everyone, from her own family to the entire neighbourhood, but the one whose life she particularly manages to light is a new neighbour named Shekhar. Shekhar is an alcoholic and lonely young man who's been a victim of society, and gradually he develops a great friendship with Mili. She makes him look at life differently, and the two fall in love. But he does not know that Mili is terminally ill and her days are counted.

A poignant and brilliantly told story, Mili can be easily ranked among the greatest realistic tearjerkers of its times. Mukherjee's direction is splendid. He manages to make this picture totally convincing and memorable in his own inimitable way. The film is not a tragedy, it is a very melancholic, yet very bright, pleasant and thoroughly optimistic piece. No filmmaker would have been able to make this film as beautifully as Mukherjee did. The narrative style is very identified with his craft and unique storytelling - like in most of his films, the script, involving common and ordinary people and following their lives during certain periods, is amazingly simple and realistic, yet the emotional impact is powerful and very effective.

Mili belongs to Jaya Bhaduri. A naturally gifted actress, she is compelling, funny and moving throughout the entire film and makes her character Mili hauntingly admirable, lovable and memorable. Amitabh Bachchan is brilliant as Shekhar. He is restrained, natural and good-looking. Ashok Kumar is unsurprisingly outstanding as Mili's loving, helpless and suffering father. Aruna Irani makes an impact in a smaller role. The film is not too long, it does not go over the top and the emotions are never overblown. It is simple, interesting, engaging and very moving. It is filled with gentle comedy, superb music and many great moments, and was evidently made with a lot of graciousness and sincerity. That's what makes a classic.",1305849600,2,2136,5.1
