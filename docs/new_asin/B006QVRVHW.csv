5013964,5,B006QVRVHW,"If you're a Nostradamus fan and looking for some good shows, buy this DVD first - it is a compilation of the other great Nostradamus shows from the History Channel remastered into one set.  (wish I knew that 8 purchases ago).",1418688000,15,225,4.487804878048781

5013966,5,B006QVRVHW,Excellent collection of Nostradamus's life and his well known prophecies. I recommend these documentaries highly.,1417305600,2,113,6.6
5013967,1,B006QVRVHW,"I am and have been very interested in Nostradamus and his quatrains for a few decades now, and have no negative feelings about him or his writings, but I believe that this particular documentary is rather politicized and somewhat of a western propaganda tool that discreetly pushes you in a direction that is somewhat biased.  I gave it 1 star and am regretting purchasing this set.  I won't be donating this to my local library or any other library.  It's going to the recycle center so nobody will be subjected to or influenced by it's interpretations.",1394582400,7,554,4.75
5013968,5,B006QVRVHW,"If you're big NOSTRADAMUS fan then is a ""must have"". It's the best of the best I've ever seen anywhere (TV, Cable, etc.). The Best!",1380672000,8,131,4.28

8503290,5,B006QVRVHW,"Extremely informative!!! So far, the other documentaries seen of Nostradamus are all summoned up inside this collection. So Id get just this one, if you have interest in this. Very insightful LOTS of footage and hours and hours of learning.",1498348800,,240,5.025

8503298,3,B006QVRVHW,"While I don't dispute the possibility that someone might postulate trends into the future, I must admit that there is incredible interpretation after the fact in the programs looking at Nostradamus.  Plus, the stuff predicting 2012 is rather funny as I look at it in 2015.  Still, it's interesting and I always like things that stimulate the imagination.",1447113600,8,354,5.086206896551724
