5679760,4,B00BWUVIXU,The last two installments in the Star Trek series only made me a bigger fan of all six. It was well packaged and in factory condition.,1394409600,,134,4.1923076923076925
5679761,2,B00BWUVIXU,"I must admit, I thought Star Trek 4 was papp.  However, 5 & 6 are so laughably bad, so fundamentally lacking in energy and spirit, that I almost wish I hadn't bought them.  5 is the worst, making fun of the genre without purpose and its plot is ridiculous.  6 is only somewhat better, but again, it lacks any soul.  I cannot recommend these, even as a die hard fan of the original series.",1488758400,,388,4.202702702702703
5679762,4,B00BWUVIXU,"This was the next-to-last movie in the original Star Trek movie series. Whatever anyone says, I still like the old show with the original cast best of all. It's a great adventure, going where no one has, in the true spirit of the old series.",1485302400,,241,4.377777777777778

5679768,5,B00BWUVIXU,Great to have both films and bonus features. Final Frontier is a lot better than its rep.,1470787200,,89,4.294117647058823

5679771,3,B00BWUVIXU,"It was okay... I love Leonard Nimoy.  I just wanted some of the collection - for mindless entertainment.... My favorite is The Search For Spock.  I just couldn't like ""The Wrath Of Kahn"", though it was good.  Some of the things in that movie were gross ;-P",1462665600,,256,4.404255319148936

5679773,5,B00BWUVIXU,Did you know that Dr. Spock was on Mission Impossible! Guy Williams on Lost in Space was Zorro in the 60's! Look on Google about the robot on Lost in Space. Mrs. Robinson was on Lassie.,1461283200,,185,4.166666666666667
5679774,2,B00BWUVIXU,"It's not that I don't like the movies. (Okay. I honestly don't care for any version of The Final Frontier.) I don't like these versions of the movies. I didn't realize it at the time I bought this set, but the version I had on VHS of The Undiscovered Country was the Director's Edition or Uncut Edition or whatever. There is a part of the subplot that was cut out of this version. And The Undiscovered Country is my personal favorite Star Trek movie, even today.

My recommendation: pay a little more for the Director's Cut or ""Special Collectors Edition."" It's worth it, especially for fans.",1457136000,2,592,4.584905660377358

5679785,5,B00BWUVIXU,Very pleased with these movies.,1436745600,,31,5.4
5679786,5,B00BWUVIXU,"Just came in the mail today so excited to finally have completed my Original Crew movie collection.  Perfect condition, plays wonderfully.  Purchased this not because I have not seen these movies, I have seen them many times but just for the heck of it I will talk briefly about the films.  Star Trek V is an okay entry in the series, most Star Trek fans can pretty much agree if there was a stinker in the Original films this was it.  Not saying its not watchable its just not nearly as good as the others, but in my personally opinion...a lot easier to watch then The Motion Picture.

Star Trek VI, is an absolute amazing film.  You get pretty much everything you could ever want out of a Star Trek movie and this film was able to send off the original cast with grace and respect.",1436140800,3,783,4.328767123287672
5679787,5,B00BWUVIXU,"Good deal for an old ""Trekkie""",1434758400,,30,4.166666666666667
5679788,5,B00BWUVIXU,"Great fan of Star Trek and had to replace my tapes, getting worn out!",1433116800,,69,4.0
5679789,5,B00BWUVIXU,"I know many folks do not like Star Trek 5, but I really like the theme of the movie. After all, are we not all looking for a greater power or truth during our life, and what more boldness than to proclaim your search for God amongst the stars, only to find Him in the human heart. That is so Star Trek!  So, I think ""Star Trek: The Final Frontier"" is a great movie.

Another bold movie is ""Star Trek: The Undiscovered County."" What is truely amazing and lasting about this movie is that it was made so long ago, but yet it still parallels what is going on in the world today. That is truely the legacy of Star Trek.

This is a great movie combination. I hope you will enjoy them for centuries yet to come.",1432425600,,705,4.094202898550725
