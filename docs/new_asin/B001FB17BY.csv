3566609,5,B001FB17BY,A great dvd.  I was thinking that it was recorded recently.  I was sorry that this was not disclosed when it was put up for sale. Other then that it was a great performance by a great Singer who will always be the queen of soul to me.,1275350400,5,234,3.8541666666666665
3566610,5,B001FB17BY,"Hace a&ntilde;os que estoy esperando este DVD, este mismo recital se estaba ofreciendo en internet a un valor cerca a los U$S 100.- imposible de comprar para la mayor&iacute;a de la gente.
Para los amantes de la m&uacute;sica soul, no poder acceder a este DVD era muy injusto. Para ser un recital de hace m&aacute;s de 20 a&ntilde;os, tanto la calidad de imagen como sonido son muy buenos. De Aretha no se puede agregar mucho m&aacute;s...por algo la llaman "" The Queen of Soul"".",1234137600,4,479,4.714285714285714

I bought the DVD referenced and wish I could just swoop in and buy this one: Live In Chicago.  Never disappointed with anything Ms Franklin has done.  There's so few live concert videos to enjoy and Aretha doesn't  travel.  Perhaps we might be treated to a few songs for the Inauguration in January, I hope so.  Watching Aretha on stage: ""the Queen of Soul"" is all one can think.",1226448000,5,564,6.0886075949367084
8301512,3,B001FB17BY,It wasn't like I've seen when she performed on television shows. Not exactly what I expected. It's ok. Way not worth the money though.,1468454400,,134,4.625

8301518,3,B001FB17BY,"Average on video quality, however, that's understandable considering the age of the concert and technology at that time. The sound quality is above average and muscial charge performance by the queen of soul. ""Live at the Philmore West"" remains my favorite live Aretha Franklin concert.",1350086400,,286,5.377777777777778
8301519,5,B001FB17BY,"Excellence performance by Aretha.  At of Nov. 4, 2010, all performances have been cancelled until May 2011.  She is currently seriously ill w/ an undiagnosed medical condition.  Keep this Lady of Inspiration in your thoughts & prayers.  Her music has been uplifting to me, in times of need.",1289865600,,290,4.979166666666667
8301520,1,B001FB17BY,The video quality was poor.  This is not a video you would want for your collection.  I'm a big Aretha fan but save your money.,1287792000,9,127,4.04
8301521,4,B001FB17BY,"Nice to hear Aretha, although modern DVD's have higher quality.  It would be nice if Aretha would do a new DVD - she still sounds good.",1284163200,2,135,4.1923076923076925
