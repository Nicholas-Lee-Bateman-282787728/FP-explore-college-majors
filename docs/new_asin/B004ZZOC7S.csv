8450525,3,B004ZZOC7S,"In LAKE PLACID, Stan Winston's special effects bring to life a monster lurking in the depths of a dark lake.

At the beginning of this story set in Maine, the sheriff (Gleeson) pulls a diver out of the water whose lower half is completely gone. The man is still alive when brought into the boat, but not for long. The creature responsible for his death is a 30-foot-long crocodile that an old lady (White) who lives on the lake has been feeding for six years, first with bits of bread when it was a baby and now with whole cows!

There's some scary moments and some sily ones, but the comedy misfires more than it works. ""Lake Placid"" is in the end a fairly brief and only so-so horror film.

.
LAKE PLACID 2 is an unnecessary and inferior TV movie sequel to this mediocre frighter. A new cast runs through their paces while we await the appearance of the oversized crocodile. It's a time waster.
