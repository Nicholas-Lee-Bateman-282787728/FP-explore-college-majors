5689281,3,B00C2U6F50,"Woodbridge close to Quantico the really crazy in the woods factory, that turns out more cold-blooded killers in the name of the DOD than any other farm of its type in the world!  Yes, very believable film made by rednecks for that murderous urge that lives inside many marines who matiruclated there and of course the ever reprehensible fbi (friggin' bad idiots)",1409616000,,362,4.838709677419355

5689283,3,B00C2U6F50,"I hope they remake this movie. If they learned anything they will. Everything from the dialog to the cinematography needs work but, I must believe this is a first effort. The casting was spot on and the actors gave it a gallant try. With all of it's individual faults I really felt something in this film. I agree with some of the problems pointed out in some of the other reviews nut I'm glad that I was able to watch all the way thru the movie.

I don't usually watch a movie a second time until some time has passed but if they take my advice and do a remake I'll watch it as soon as it comes out.",1403481600,3,600,4.042016806722689
5689284,3,B00C2U6F50,A unique film amongst its genre of post apocalyptic dystopian future. A personal story that deals with the struggle of a pair of sisters. Not particularly well made but pretty well written for the short and simple tale it tells. The ending is contrived but fits.,1398556800,,262,4.717391304347826
5689285,4,B00C2U6F50,"No gore, and very little action, but a good and thoughtful post-apocalyptic mood piece. Well worth a Sunday afternoon viewing.",1397347200,7,126,5.35
5689286,1,B00C2U6F50,"Boring, Snoring.... From the beginning I could tell this was a budget movie, poorly directed with poor writing as well.  I toughed it out for maybe 25 minutes and couldn't bring myself to finish this waste of time. Cheap props found in a desert, unknown actors, silly school kids songs and out of place psychedelics from Alice in wonderland.  No continuity of plot. Need I say more. Not worth your time.",1395878400,5,403,4.661971830985915
5689287,1,B00C2U6F50,"I don't know what was worse, the always shaking camera, predictable plot or the terrible acting. I guess it's OK for an indie movie but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",1394928000,,170,4.516129032258065
5689288,2,B00C2U6F50,"Yet another movie I will never see because they found it necessary to deliberately shake the image around as if it is being filmed on a cellphone. Two minutes was enough.

I can't tell you how much I am looking forward to the time when this stupid cinematic novelty fades away and they go back to presenting a movie rather than shaking it around in your face.",1394582400,26,359,4.358208955223881
5689289,5,B00C2U6F50,"I liked that this movie had a Navajo in it (if I'm not mistaken). I wish that he had more lines and played a bigger role. He has potential to do more (I can see that). That's what I liked most about this film: that there was a Navajo in it. Everything else was good as well. The plot was easy to follow, the picture., New Mexico is a beautiful place. And I really liked the whole indie-film vibe that this movie gives off..very nice. I have been wanting to watch this movie since I came across the trailer back in 2012...Good Job. Need more movies of that Navajo actor on screen. =)",1391558400,2,582,4.15929203539823
5689290,5,B00C2U6F50,"The press is calling it a ""Re-imagining of the Wizard of Oz"" by Frank L Baum,. Two young girls, up against the elements on the open road! 5 shotgun shells, and every one counts! This gritty, post-apocalyptic road film is blowing up on the festival circuit! New York, Austin and now a European Premiere! When I watched the film with my friends we were in suspense from the from the first frame!  Really loved the relationship between the two sisters played by Kelsey Hutton and Evie Kozikowski. Also stellar work from young native actor Lincoln Mark and the bad guy Chad Brummett
who has been in Lone Ranger, Breaking Bad you name it!  I believe Director Paul Myers just picked up an international sales agent! Film Republic out of London!

5689292,2,B00C2U6F50,"Depressing. Desolation. Desperation. Bleak. These are some of the words to describe this movie. This was not a pleasant movie to watch. The story was depressing to watch as two sisters try to survive with a gun and 5 shells as their protection after their parents are murdered. The portrayal of the two girls was okay as they demonstrated a close bond with each other. There are many redundant and repetitious scenes with the characters in the movie because the girls are traveling on foot some of the way to their destination with rest stops along the way. But the dialogue between the girls kept my interest. There are your typical additional characters supplying drama, peril, and comfort for the girls. Will the girls run out of bullets? Will there be ""light"" at the end of their journey or disappointment? These are questions to be answered as the movie unfolds. There was an interesting take on a popular classic movie that the girls refer to to give them hope and consolation. Even though I watched this movie all the way through, it left me feeling empty and depressed. Maybe that was its purpose.",1483488000,,1105,4.730569948186528

5689305,4,B00C2U6F50,"I enjoyed this movie very much.  The pacing was just fine for me and I thought the mental travel the main girl makes from sister to psycho was great.  For the budget they had I was impressed.  If you need, blood, guts,  and explosions this is not for you.  I actually made some connections to The Road with this movie.  Although not even close to as gritty and dark as The Road, I was able to immerse myself in this world and wanted more.

The hand held camera feel didn't bother me in this one for some reason.  I know a lot of people hate that look, but I didn't think it was to over done.  I think if you can overlook some minor flaws and put yourself in this story situation you will enjoy this movie.

There are some scenes of graphic sex in a magazine.  Although very very brief, they are there.",1432857600,2,801,4.136363636363637

The ending was more than a little creepy and not in a fun horror film sort of way but teen/tween kids getting drunk and having sex. Whoever made this is seriously sexually repressed or something.",1422144000,,278,4.8125

8576765,1,B00C2U6F50,"Low budget doesn't have to mean bad... plenty of great low budget movies.

This is not such a movie. I really began to hate the characters...yeah, the sisters too. The older one is an idiot, the younger one seems smarter but c'mon... when you're given multiple warnings and every reason in the world to act a certain way (won't spoil things), why wouldn't you take those opportunities? It beggared belief and reached that point where I couldn't get into the movie because of how much I disliked the characters (really, I disliked the writing by the writer/director).

Still, for a low budget film, it was shot better than many I've seen, and the acting was okay for the most part. Just a shame they were given such terrible lines.",1508544000,,730,4.651162790697675

8576770,3,B00C2U6F50,"At first when there was only a deserted road in the middle of nowhere I thought this movie was about another zombie apocalypse.
I didn't think much of the concept because the silly girl wears a dress throughout the movie and not one pair of pants. I was surprise to see her backpack. She was quick to jump in the vehicle to sleep for the night. This story shows the sister difference but only one sister was bold, very bold. I was counting shells throughout the movie.",1493424000,,468,4.390804597701149
8576771,1,B00C2U6F50,"Low budget and poorly written. Its like a bad film school movie where the creators didn't have an overarching vision, just a shot by shot hit list. Plus over-sexualized little girls is a bit played out and immature. I feel bad for the actresses that have this on their resume, These guys have a huge hard-on for Tarantino and try desperately to create something in that realm.",1490918400,,376,4.626865671641791
