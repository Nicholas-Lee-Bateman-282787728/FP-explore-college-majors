1212008,3,B00000FDYZ,"The technical part of this review refers to the Brentwood Home Video or BCI Eclipse version.
From the Aaron Spelling stable of TV movies comes this tale with Ricky Nelson (and his wife Kris Nelson) as an idealistic couple. Ricky is running for Mayor of a small western town against Edward Andrews who plays a corrupt town boss. Jack Elam is his Sheriff and Andy Devine is his Judge, both firmly entrenched in his back pocket.
Pat O'Brien comes to town as Ricky Nelson's father-in-law, a retired Texas Ranger who rounds up his old partners (Walter Brennan, Edgar Buchanan and Chill Wills)!!! Throw in Gypsy Rose Lee as the owner of the local saloon and you got yourself a pretty good (for TV) rip-snorting western. You know how it's going to play out, but watching the all these stars in action makes up for a sub-par script.
Unfortunately the transfer is from a well-used print that looks like it was recorded in long play mode. At times, scenes taking place at night are almost unwatchable. But the chance to see these stars of westerns in their later years is a treat you should not miss if you're a fan of the western genre.
Brentwood/BCI put in their usual extras, six chapter stops, a DVD dictionary, trivia game and a short subject (Hal Roach's ""Little Rascals""). This movie is also in a 10 pack of westerns at about triple the price for this one film from Brentwood Home Video called ""The Wild West"" and is available from Amazon.com.",1079308800,7,1440,4.607003891050583

In addition to the big name actors, this movie is full of recognizable faces.  The movie was popular enough that a sequel was made as a pilot for a possible ABC series.  If you like westerns you will probably enjoy this if for no other reason than to see a lot of old, familiar faces return to the screen.

1212579,4,B00000FDYZ,"This product of an earlier generation was both entertaining and uplifting. It came out of a Hollywood era when moral values had meaning and good always triumphed of bad. The casting was excellent with Pat O'Brien as the aging and retired Commander of Texas Ranger whose son in law, who owns the local newspaper, tries to defeat the local tyrannical mayor in an upcoming election, well played by the prominent character actor Edward Andrews. Jack Elam who usually plays a bumbling, comic character is well cast as the corrupt sheriff. Andy Divine, usually cast as an upbeat ""good guy"" is in league with the corrupt sheriff and mayor as a crooked local Judge. Gypsy Rose Lee, owner of the local saloon, represents the upbeat and concerned citizens of the town. Finally, rounding out the cast as the main characters are three aging, and now physically challenged, Texas Rangers who respond the the call from their former commander. Walter Brennan, Chill Wills, and Edward Buchanan turn in great performances of men who, finding themselves lacking their former physical abilities, prove that by using their wits they can defeat evil and help good triumph.  This film is not Oscar material, but it is certainly worth sitting back and enjoying.",1426636800,3,1238,4.980676328502415
1212580,1,B00000FDYZ,"The image quality was so horrifically bad that I didn't more than about 15 minutes of it.

I have never seen anything that bad! It takes real nerve to rent something which is virtually little better than a fuzzy image.  The plot and acting were fine.  Amazon quite obviously used some image from  a non-restored source to rent on the cheap - or something like that.  I cannot stress enough what a rotten experience it was.  I don't mind being abused - but without even a kiss?

BTW - you can search your records and I think you'll find that I've never ever complained about one of your products or services before.

The main objection I have to this film and the reason I say it isn't good family entertainment is the drinking element.  Drunkenness is not funny and I don't believe a normal social life in the old West revolved around saloons.  Sadly, many westerns portray that generation as universally accepting drinking (including this one).  The cowboys always go to the saloon and order beer or whiskey.  You have to be careful what you teach your kids is funny.  If they see you laughing at drunken antics on the screen, they will act out; that's never funny.  That's my two cents worth from a Christian perspective. Just remember that if your kids get in trouble and alcohol is involved you may find yourself asking the question ""Is drunkenness really funny?""  The only redeeming quality for this film is that the aging rangers persevere and use their wits (sort of).",1323129600,2,953,4.664670658682635

1213100,4,B00000FDYZ,"Wow...it's probably been around 30 years since I've last seen this film.  This was a made-for-TV movie that originally aired on ABC WAY back in 1969 and would inspire a seqel ""The Over The Hill Gang Rides Again"" in 1970.  Not a classic film but it's notable due to the many great old actors who starred in the movie.

Pat O'Brien is Oren Hayes, a former Texas Ranger captain who goes to visit his son Jeff played by Ricky Nelson.  Jeff is having trouble with a bunch or corrupt baddies including Judge Polk (Andy Devine) and Sheriff Barnes (Jack Elam).  When is son is beaten up, Hayes calls on his three old Texas Ranger pals to help: Nash Crawford (Walter Brennan), George Agnew (Chill Wills) and Jason Fitch (Edgar Buchannon).  The foursome find themselves the subject of jokes by the badguys and they realize they are no longer the young gunslingers they used to be.  But where the body fails the mind is still sharp and Rangers eventually use their wits to win the day before riding off into the sun in separate directions in the film's almost tearful final scene.

This film is not a classic but it's great to see these old veterans of westerns in what would be one of their final screen appearances and the interplay between them is just wonderful.  The cast also includes legendary bad guy William Smith in one of his earliest villian roles.  A fun film and you can't beat the price!",1108944000,,1391,4.528

Rose's visiting father-in-law, retired Texas Ranger Captain Oren Hayes (Pat O'Brien) sends an urgent telegraph to three of his former command (Walter Brennan, Chill Wills and Edgar Buchanan) to come to Boulder immediately and help him clean up the town.
 THE OVER-THE-HILL GANG is a 1969 made-for-television movie that was popular enough at the time to lead to a sequel a year later.  For old movie fans it's hard to beat the appeal of this veteran character actor laden movie.  It's fun to see them play off each other and confront a situation that their advancing years have forced them to deal with more with guile than brute force.  What's not so much fun is seeing them saddled with this tired, predictable plot.
 Brennan and Buchanan shine brightest in this one; Brennan as the gun slinger who's lost a bit of speed on his quick draw and Buchanan as the scout who's eyesight has deteriorated to the point that he's drawing his guns on stuffed and mounted bears.  With a better script, and a more delicate and penetrating examination of what it feels like to suddenly find yourself old and in the way, this one could have been a classic for the ages rather than an amusing piece of fluff.
  The print transfer to dvd is so-so.  Some of the night scenes are muddy and it's hard to make out what's happening.  The dvd also comes with the Little Rascals' short ""Hooky Spooky.""
 Fans of old movies should enjoy the veteran character actors in this, although they may agree that the folks in front of the camera in THE OVER-THE-HILL GANG deserved far better.",1090022400,26,1766,4.713355048859935
