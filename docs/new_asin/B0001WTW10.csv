8017396,1,B0001WTW10,"Galileo Smith must be the single worst video I've ever seen about the solar system geared towards kids. The story line made virtually no sense, and the acting didn't help at all either. But there are some decent solar system videos with really awful acting and plot, and this isn't one of them. In one embarassing scene, two of the kids (boy and girl) started dancing together after Galileo Smith said that Pluto and Charon were in a dance. Nothing was said about gravity or mass or any other useful physics concept, they just started doing a pop dance and it went on and on with no further explanation. Seriously, this is one dumb video. I have to wonder about the quote on the back of the box from an ""assistant teacher"" and whether it was real, or just another bogus quote like the movie studios use for expensive movies.",1090627200,9,824,4.5
