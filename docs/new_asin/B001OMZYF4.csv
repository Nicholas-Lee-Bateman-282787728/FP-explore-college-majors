8330908,5,B001OMZYF4,"This series cought me by suprise. You see I had some what enjoyed Card Captors. But not got to be a huge fan because it was of course directed at girls. But I heard good things about Tsubasa and that it had something for us guys too. So I gave it a chance and was tottally hooked.
Of course during the second season it does get a little weird. But still very good.

Volume 12 is perhaps some of the best of season two.  My question is in the anime they act as if at the end of the last episode on the disk it's the end of the series. Is this true? Im very much wondering due to I cannot find any hint of another disk comming on amazon.

So anyways enjoy the series!",1240012800,,665,3.911111111111111
