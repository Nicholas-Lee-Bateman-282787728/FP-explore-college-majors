8563715,5,B00B7U2938,"I bought a ukulele five weeks ago and didn't have a clue where to start until I found these lessons. I looked at a few others first and they seemed overly complicated, but these lessons were very simple to follow and enjoyable at the same time. The instructor seems to have a knack for making you feel relaxed which helps with the learning experience.
There are also helpful links to songs and Chord charts as well.
Highly recommended.",1359676800,5,435,4.589743589743589

8563717,5,B00B7U2938,"This is the first time I've felt I can really learn to play an instrument. I bought a tenor ukulele two days ago and thanks to these video lessons learning to use it is so much fun.
My 8 yr old was kinda doubting that he would never learn the ukulele but with his first lesson from this dvd he has changed his mind and is determind to learn now..
The lessons are laid out clearly and methodically and you are led through at a nice slow pace with great patience and thorough explanations along with great graphics and diagrams.",1359590400,6,526,4.27
