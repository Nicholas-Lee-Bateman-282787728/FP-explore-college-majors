8362434,5,6303451683,"Is it fair to call 'Caged Hearts' one of the most important and worthwhile films of the decade? Absolutely. In a world in which racial profiling, unfair trials, and trials that are not handled fairly exist, it is only logical that there might be underground organizations in which those atop the penal system degrade and prostitute young women who bare the robes of the prison lifestyle. This mesmerizing film brings to light many questions. First of all, what happens when a judge atop the penal system intentionally obstructs justice so that a beautiful young piece of tail is forced into prison and soon after a life of underground prison prostitution? This scenario likely occurs several times a day in the sweaty bowels of our nation's female penatentiaries. Second, what happens when a lawyer who was eager to join the underground club of society's elite makes a mistake and realizes shortly thereafter that he should have in fact defended his client? The film's writers and directors were clearly well versed in Des Cartes, for it is through this philosophers' metaphysics that we are able to disect the reasoning behind the conception of women who are falsely accused of crimes and then forced to be prostitutes because such a life is more desirable than that of the caged Hobbesian beast. Hithero, those seeking pornography need not purchase this coup-de-gras cinematic accomplishment; the rare nudity that appears throughout this piece of art is used only to exasperate the degradation and utter sense of dehumanization that every single one of our nation's female prisoners is forced to endure on a daily basis less they end up prostitutes engaging in lude behavior with societiy's seemingly accomplished felons who are actually deemed heroes under the facade of a robe and gavel. The third and most troubling question is what happens when a prison warden who identifies as Female-American betrays her fellow vaginaly-equipped peoples and decides to act as a participant and an organizer of the all-to-common and shameful act of forced prostitution of woman prisoners who are falsley accused of a crime they didn't commit and sentenced to life imprisonment by the same judges who want to rape them? Future presidential candidates should analyze this film in order to come to terms with the many over-arching questions that this film arrouses. Is there a cure for the human condition? Only by watching and re-watching 'Caged Hearts' can we fully realize the implications that society forces upon our daughters like a mad judge crazy about forced female prison prostitutes.",1054080000,13,2582,5.12085308056872
