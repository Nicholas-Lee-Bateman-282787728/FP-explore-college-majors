8444426,3,B004W4U9GU,"Who would have expected the fiercely patriotic French to produce a film full of American pop music ? Many of the tunes rolled out to help create mood in this film have been thrashed over the years. What happened to that notoriously Francophile attitude of the French ? Was this film designed for American audiences ?

This is a charming film in many ways, but just as ""The Big Chill"" before it made a big deal out of recycling old 60s pop music, here we have the same old 60s and 70s tunes. Wait a minute, in ""The Big Chill"" we had Americans and the American songs that might have had something to do with the characters' fading youth, since they were thirty-somethings and that film was set in the early 80s. Surely in this 2010 film these French thirty or forty-somethings would have grown up in the 80s or 90s with French music ?

Oddly enough, the film I saw just before watching this was a re-run of ""Easy Rider"" from 1969, which included a song by The Band ""The Weight"". Imagine my surprise watching the very next film, a French film made 40 years later and there it is again, ""The Weight"". This is meant to be France !

One of the even more absurd moments involves a young up-and-coming singer-songwriter who has unexpectedly popped in on the Marion Cotillard character. Remember this is a French film. He wants to impress her and the other characters, so what does he do ? He sings a sensitive song to them, but in English ! Maybe this is the reason his turning up didn't go down well with her ?

So okay, the south of France, how about a little more of the French in the French movie ? Well, they do talk in French, there's some of that pretty French architecture, plenty of outdoor meals and there are a couple of baguettes in one scene.",1367712000,2,1747,4.3496932515337425

8444428,5,B004W4U9GU,I loved this film!  Saw it at the Reed College French House.  The actors are so expressive and beautiful.  I hope they release this for the US.  It finds a balance between art and realism and feeling empty and feeling alive.  Fantastic soundtrack and a great intro to French cinema.  I DESPERATELY WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN AND HOPE TO SEE IT ON NETFLIX OR ITUNES OR ON DVD FOR OUR REGION :),1348099200,7,386,4.219178082191781
8444429,5,B004W4U9GU,"I had seen a trailer on the Internet and that it was being released at some theaters on 08/24/12. It was one I wanted to see but wasn't showing at any nearby theaters. Seeing that it was a 2010 movie, I checked Amazon and found it there. The Region A worked in my blu-ray player and I was not disappointed with the movie. It is one of best ensemble cast movies I have seen in a while. Like the other 5* rating, it reminded me of The Big Chill, but with more current story lines. All of the performances were excellent. The overall 3* rating is misleading as one review isn't about the movie, but that fact they couldn't play the DVD on their player. If you have a blu-ray player, set the subtitles to English and enjoy this excellent movie!",1345766400,2,740,4.25531914893617
8444430,5,B004W4U9GU,"Since I have an all-region DVD player, I was able to enjoy this exquisite movie about a group of friends who decide to take a previously planned vacation after one of them (played by Academy Award winner, Jean Dujardin) gets seriously injured in an accident. This character-driven movie deals with lies we tell ourselves, lies we tell others to keep face, and the consequences, positive or negative, for sometimes telling the truth. At the heart of it is the acceptance of friends for who they are, with their human frailties exposed. The ending, like the coming together of a complex tapestry, is extremely powerful and emotionally moving. There's not a false note in the fine ensemble cast. I sincerely hope that a Region 1 version will be released in the near future for North American consumption.",1330732800,18,801,4.897058823529412
8444431,1,B004W4U9GU,I was excited about this film when I purchased it earlier this month.  It WILL NOT play on Region 1 players!,1328313600,2,108,4.142857142857143
