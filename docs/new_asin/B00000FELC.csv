1211457,5,B00000FELC,"PBS created this wonderful production about Martha Ballard from the book of the same name. Martha Ballard's story is intertwined with the historical detective work of a modern day historian who was working with Martha's personal journal.

We all know about Benjamin Franklin, Abigail Adams, George Washington. However, ""A Midwife's Tale"" is about an ordinary citizen.  Se was a wife, a mother, a caregiver, a citizen of a young country.  We only know about her because she kept a detailed journal about her life and those around her.  She attended over 1,000 women when they gave birth and never lost a mother. She tended to the sick. She grew her own herbs which were used as medication. She was a midwife, a doctor, a nurse and a pharmacist but never viewed herself as a hero.

As I watched this DVD I grew to know Martha Ballard and to respect her.  I watched it again and and again was left with many thoughts about her.  Our history is fraught with so many unsung heros like Martha Ballard whose story need to be told.

PBS did not make an effort to glamorize her story--costuming was true to her era; a minimum of make-up seemes to have been used; her home was simple and was shown as such.  This is a fascinating story about an ordinary woman and it is done beatifully.",1257033600,7,1276,4.537117903930131
1211458,4,B00000FELC,Movie is very interesing and very very well done. Not for those who do not enjoy historical reasearch and methodology.,1240099200,3,118,4.95
1211459,5,B00000FELC,"I originally had to watch this film for a women's history class.  What began as a chore turned to so much more.  This film is beautiful.  I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen.  The film depicts the life of Martha Ballard.  Martha is an early American woman who records her daily life in her diary.  It spans the years 1785-1812.  The film brings to life the ""ordinary"" daily chores of 18th century women.  However, we begin to see that those lives are never ordinary, but are riddled with constant obstacles.  Martha is a midwife, as the title suggests.  But, she is actually much more than that.  She is also a nurse and physician.  She is a great woman who cares for her neighbors in a way that would seem taboo today.  The film delivers many great moments, and the aura left is nothing less than poetic.  I recommend this film to all who cherish beauty at its best.  You will not be disappointed.",1233446400,19,901,4.408536585365853
1211460,5,B00000FELC,"Not all history is cannons and muskets. In truth most history is not. And in many parts really quite boring. But everything has its place. Like the great bard said, The world is a stage and we are all but actors upon it.

And this film based on the research and reading of one woman's diary is really quite interesting.

It is the story of a midwife. It begins after the American revolution and through it we travel through time to her world to visit. We meet her husband. We meet some of her offspring. But best of all we meet her world.

Nicely re-enacted. Nicely done. Well researched. A must for anyone interested in the time period.",1165190400,,637,4.38135593220339
1211461,5,B00000FELC,"This video is an excellent source of information for anyone who wants to know what life was really like back on the 18th-century frontier. The acting is earnest and not too theatrical. The scenery is harsh, yet breathtakingly beautiful. The soundtrack, featuring the Word of Mouth Chorus, got me totally hooked on shapenote singing. The blending of the singing and the New England scenery is extremely moving.  I do hope that they come out with a DVD edition of  this film. Although firmly based on the wonderful book by the same name, this film stands on its own as a documentary of colonial life. I own many books, films and CDs concerning colonial history and this film is a real gem. I prefer to collect DVDs these days instead of VHS tapes, but I made an exception for this film - it is worth it.",1077062400,7,801,4.517241379310345
1211462,5,B00000FELC,"I know of no other film which so beautifully blends historical fact (as with a documentary) with re-enactment drama. Kaiulani Lee (one of the finest actors of this generation and under-used in my opinion) creates a spellbinding performance as Martha Ballard, beautifully parallelling Laurel Thatcher Ulrich's quest 200 years later.  I have watched this film again and again (I use it when I teach classes on scriptwriting) and am still making new discoveries of nuance.  My only disappointment is that it has not been released on DVD.  Get with it, PBS--this one deserves to be seen for the next 200 years!",1074211200,5,606,4.98019801980198
1211463,4,B00000FELC,"If you're interested in keeping files of your geneology/lineage, this would be a documentry/movie for you. They made a movie out of diaries and other information and saw how someones life could have been like back in that time. I find it interesting.",1046390400,2,250,4.837209302325581
1211464,5,B00000FELC,"When I watched this VHS movie for the first time, I wasn't expecting much.  I very nearly turned it off because the first 15 minutes were boring and slow.  But once they got past the yada, yada, yada and into this woman's life story, it was completely enthralling.
I watched it a second time with the family, fast forwarding past the boring introduction.  The fam also found it very interesting.
The movie is kind of a docu-drama, recreated from the detailed diary of a 1780's midwife.  The details about life back then are just beyond description.
One tidbit - premarital sex wasn't the scandal that we'd expect in those times.  However, a woman would be asked, in the throes on intense labor, to name the father of the baby.  The woman's testimony during these intense moments was considered solid and incontrovertible.  If the baby's father refused to marry the woman, THAT was scandalous.
This movie was filled with those kind of details.  I can't recommend this VHS-tape enough.  One of the best movies I think I've ever seen.",991353600,18,1031,4.747191011235955
1211512,5,B00000FELC,Amazing account of wilderness life from a personal account. No fiction. I think everyone would benefit from watching this. We live very different lives today.,1400630400,,158,5.36
1211513,5,B00000FELC,"I use this video in my women's history class.  The story, taken from diary entries, gives a realistic look at the hard life women had and the limited freedom they possessed in post Revolutionary America.  Martha Ballard's diary starts when she is 50 and goes to her death.  Her role as a midwife provides her with more physical and financial freedom than most of her peers.  Yet, her life is hard and the work of a woman is never ending.  The video brings to life the day to day drudgery and constant suffering many women endured.  No matter how much I describe it, the students don't get the relentlessness of their lives and the lack of power they exercise over their lives.  Martha's diary and her strength give the students a visual image and clear away any romantic notions of living as a woman prior to the 20th century.  The video is based on the book by the same name by Laurel Thatcher Ulrich.",1394409600,,902,4.4573170731707314
1211514,4,B00000FELC,"this story needs to be told much more often, not enough attention is given in todays life and culture about birthing. this DVD says what moms and grandmas know, men should not be in the business of bringing babies, it's a womans job, I know there are some bad midwives out there ( 20 years a nurse) but women are better at this than men are.",1393804800,,341,4.181818181818182
1211515,3,B00000FELC,"A Midwife's Tale is a documentary about a book by the same name based on the life of an 18th century midwife named Martha Ballard. I enjoyed reading the book very much when I was writing a paper on the history of midwifery and obstetrics for midwifery school. For that reason, I added the movie to my netflix list as soon as I knew it existed!
  Laurel Thatcher Ulrich began writing A Midwife's Tale because she was so curious about Martha's diary. Other historians had not spent much time on it but she found the more she decoded Martha's daily happenings and activities, the more she found stories woven throughout along with Martha's feelings about her life. Martha's husband was a respected surveyor and she a homemaker who was very busy with her own children, and all her daily tasks- spinning, weaving, sewing, gardening, cooking and cleaning. On top of all that, she was a healer and midwife who attended over 1000 births in her lifetime and rarely lost a mother or baby.
  While the book decodes Martha's diary and tells us about the town, her family life and the economy of the time, the movie follows Martha specifically as she moves to Maine and until she dies. Her family life changes and there is even a season where she does not attend very many births. I enjoyed watching the documentary because it is very accurate from the clothes to the houses. It was very neat to see the book come to life on the screen. If you haven't read the book before, the movie can stand alone with its 90 minute length although, I have to say, the movie covers very little of Miss Ulrich's comprehensive book. The movie and the book together would make a great gift set and I look forward to adding the movie to my library soon.
  The book deserves a review all its own, but I will add it does have a few feminist angles, as does the movie, which I didn't find to be historically accurate or true to Martha's diary. The movie also includes a few nude shots that are not relevant to the story line but added it to make things more 'interesting.' Personally, I think the content is fascinating without it and it was very unnecessary. It is sad that media says something else these days. With that said, I think most people would enjoy the book over the movie, but I still enjoyed the movie none the less.
  Everyone should brush up on their colonial history. The idea that most women and children died in childbirth before doctors came on the scene is very false. Martha had incredible stats and was very skilled at her task!",1377129600,5,2517,4.49234135667396

1211517,1,B00000FELC,Where are the Natives? where are the pirates? this is not an accurate portrayal of colonial life. I bet non of the other reviewers have even read a history book. But these people did not live like this. Roads? where did these roads come from? I can't believe that Jesus is not in a single scene. what a terrible depiction of colonial America. Just absolutely appalling. I will not show this movie to my class ever again. Just plain stupid.,1359936000,,439,4.5
1211518,1,B00000FELC,"Overall, it wasn't a bad film. Just kidding it was, but there were tits, so there's that. Plus the sheep (in the scene after her husband was ill) should be named Lady Gaga cause he has such a great pokerface. It was difficult, but I managed to fap to this thanks to Martha Ballard's sweet sweet ass. Finished just before she expired. 10/10 would fap again.",1350086400,5,356,4.409090909090909
1211519,2,B00000FELC,"MUCH more a documentary of the ""author"" of the book than a dramatization or ""docu-drama"" of the midwife.

VERY meh",1285545600,,114,4.7
1211520,5,B00000FELC,"The film itself was intriguing. From a layperson's point of view, the film gave an excellent overview of the book, a glimpse into 18th century life and an historian at work. From an historian's point of view, the film segments showing Ulrich and her meticulous research techniques was impressive. Unfortunately, personal computers with efficient software to make spreadsheets and databases a simple task, were not available in the 80s and early 90s which would have made the meticulous documentation of events from the diary much easier. Ulrich was actually recording events and charting trends by hand on a hardcopy chart which makes her effort and time devoted to the dairy of Martha Ballard even more impressive. The film illustrates to the general public that true history research and writing involves being a detective that interprets evidence to come to educated conclusions about how the past mostly likely played out instead of people who just regurgitate names, dates and events. Reading the book of course will give far more detail into the life of Martha Ballard and late 18th century and early 19th century rural culture and society in New England, but if you want an excellent brief picture of the past then the film performs this task well.",1260662400,9,1255,5.038461538461538

Unless you are terminally ill, in which case you will definitely want to spend time on it, since it will make each minute spent listening to the dreary voiceover feel like an eternity.

If I could leave a zero star review I would; It should be a serious contender for the most exquisitely boring video ever produced. Added bonus feature: the story is depressing.",1492214400,,488,4.48314606741573

7908315,5,B00000FELC,"It's pretty rare for me to give a movie its own posting on my Passion for the Past historical blog; you know it's got to be something very special. Let's be honest about it: putting ""historical accuracy"" and ""movies"" in the same breath is pretty much an oxymoron, and it is unfortunate that 'Hollywood history' is where too many armchair historians get their knowledge of the past from. Oh, every-so-often they'll get it right, but not very. Even the History Channel, that go-to place for all things historical, would rather forsake accuracy for drama (can anyone belch ""Sons of Liberty""?).
But ""A Midwife's Tale"" is a true exception, for it is an exceptional movie. Or should I say it's an exceptional documentary? Hmmm...okay---docu-drama...
Well, whatever you want to call it, it plays so much like a movie that - I swear! - I can't tell the difference.
And this film is very historically accurate and absolutely can educate...
The story of A Midwife's Tale - the true story - is a wonderful primary source for historians, for the daily diary of Martha Ballard (1735 to 1812) was put into book-form as a sort of dissertation/novel by author Laurel Thatcher Ulrich. The book is a model of social history at its best. Giving portions of Ballard's diary, it recounts the life and times of this obscure Maine housewife and midwife. Using passages from the diary as a starting point for each chapter division, Ulrich, a professor at the University of New Hampshire, demonstrates how the seemingly trivial details of Ballard's daily life reflect and relate to prominent themes in the history of the early republic: the role of women in the economic life of the community, the nature of marriage and sexual relations, the scope of medical knowledge and practice.
Shortly after A Midwife's Tale was published, Laurie Kahn-Leavitt, a film producer, read a review of the book, bought a copy, loved it, and worked to secure the film rights.
From the very beginning, Lahn-Leavitt had the idea of interweaving the story of Martha Ballard's life with author Laurel Ulrich's process of piecing it together. She had planned right from the start to have it begin as a documentary and evolve into a historically accurate drama.
And she succeeded.
With all my years of studying the period, I have never seen any film get it right quite like A Midwife's Tale does: in speech & language, clothing, morals & values of the time, and, well, in FEEL. The only other movies I've seen come even close to historic accuracy in sight and sound in this manner have been the John Adams HBO mini-series and Lincoln starring Daniel Day-Lewis from a few years ago.
Since my first viewing, A Midwife's Tale has haunted me. No, not in a scary way, but, rather, in such a manner that wills me to now look at historic 18th century houses with more discerning eyes and a more intimate mindset. I will see beyond the walls and presenters to feel the ghosts of those who lived within the walls during the time of the good old colony days.
Ahhh...if only walls could talk indeed!
And yet, they do.
Is A Midwife's Tale a happy and upbeat film?
No.
Oh, there are happy times, but the movie is rather dark and daring.
Real.
From the social historian to the casual history buff, from the living historian & reenactor to the historical presenter - all who want to see real history come to life on their television screens should make watching A Midwife's Tale a priority.
Don't you just love watching history when they finally get it right?

This documentary was very informative on the hard work done by the historian who wrote the book did to interpret the diary of an 18th century woman and midwife.  I sat down and watched this film twice in one sitting.  Very informative for women of today who think they have it rough!  Martha Ballard was extraordinary and her quiet life in Maine during the Federalist period in America is fascinating! If not for her diary, she would have been virtually unknown.
