452837,5,6302327725,"In this day of dubious value systems and a real need for our next generation to learn of kindness and generosity, This Movie is worth a thousand words of lecturing to them. It says eloquently what needs desparately to be said to our children about what's right.",974419200,3,261,4.574468085106383
452838,5,6302327725,"I only saw the Selfish Giant once many, many years ago. It was a beautiful and touching story that lingers in my memory to this day. I have two young nephews that I think would be touched by the magic of this story as well. I bought the book for Christmas for them, and if I could couple that with the video, it would make a memorable gift. But, alas, the video is not available. It must be rereleased.",974160000,10,402,4.10126582278481
452839,5,6302327725,"I was very small when I first saw The Selfish Giant, but it changed my life.  I am now 38 years old, but continue to be impacted by the message of this movie.  Please put this touching story back into circulation by making it VHS format.  It is a ""Classic"" in the truest sense of the word!!!",973296000,2,291,4.0701754385964914
452840,5,6302327725,"I saw this video years ago and was just amazed.  I can't believe that it's not a more popular video or story.  It's so beautiful.  You must get out your Kleenex though, because it would make even a giant cry.  Redo this video.  Someone.  Please.",972086400,2,245,4.333333333333333
452841,5,6302327725,A wonderful animation.  Emotionally tugging at the end with the Christian symbolism. Music like Peter Paul & Mary. Heartwarming. I have viewed my copy so many times that the sound is almost erased. I am desperately  searching for another copy.,951177600,4,243,5.05
452842,5,6302327725,"I saw this animated short when I was growing up in the 1970s... as it used to air on special occaisions on the local tv network. It has stayed in my mind as a beautifully animated interpetation of Oscar Wilde's short story.  This memory has not been garnished or embellished, as I recently had an  opportunity to see this show once again. The Selfish Giant learns the harsh  lesson of his own self-imposed limitations after he seals himself off from  the world in anger. In his self-imposed exile, for selfish reasons, Summer  (who is characterised as a real person) passes his home by. 'He is too...  Selfish!' she thinks. Because summer 'forgets' to visit the giant's garden  and home, the north wind, the hail, the frost and the snow come to stay and  rule the giant's garden. These are all presented as real characters, and  the animated series and music that accompanies this program is delightful.  The hail is a true inspiration (you must see his character!). When the  giant begins to rue his mistake, he is given the opportunity to repent his  selfishness when some children sneak into his garden and spring briefly  returns. There is a good lesson in this video, if you can find it. The  music, animation stylings and the story make for a magical video that the  whole family will enjoy. I definately recommend it, and will continue to  search for an available copy!",944352000,19,1376,4.694560669456067
452873,5,6302327725,"I saw this film as a child and it has stayed with me all my life (38 now). It was run on TV in Canada along with 'The Happy Prince' and 'The Little Mermaid' -- all multi-tissues viewing for sure. I believe they were all made by the same animation studio.  I did a search online and found out that Reader's Digest released all three films together on VHS, and they are still available if you search for them! They are narrated by Christopher Plummer (which sounds right to me). Let your fingers do the walking (across the keyboard) and I think you might be lucky in tracking a copy down!

""The rest of your life will be up to you...believe in your dreams and they'll all come true.""  -- song from the Little Mermaid",1166745600,3,714,4.274074074074074
452874,5,6302327725,"I searched for this version of the story for years... literally... my children are now 13 and 14 and have never seen it! The story itself is brilliant, but with the music, songs, animation and narration makes it a truly magical feeling inside you when viewed with friends and family.",1133568000,3,283,4.68
452875,5,6302327725,"I saw this once on TV in the eary 1970's and have never forgotten how special it is.  I recently obtained it on VHS and, not having seen it in 30 years, was so very moved by it.  It is something that should be watched by the whole family, I can't believe it's not more well known.  And the two songs...I still can't get them out of my head.

This is a truly special show that, once you watch it, you want to share with others.",1132876800,6,426,3.9186046511627906
452876,5,6302327725,"My mother taped this off the Disney Channel when we had free cable for a month. That was in the early '90s. I loved it as a kid, and I still love it! (I'm 18 now)

The song Building A Wall stays with me. It makes me think. Years Go Over makes me think too, about the future.

The lesson learned by the Selfish Giant is one, I think, many people still need to learn.

Highly recommend this movie for everyone! I'm going to watch it now!",1130284800,3,435,3.9770114942528734
452877,5,6302327725,"I first saw ""the Selfish Giant"", being broadcast on Nat'l TV back in the early spring of 1973 over at a friend's house during my college days. I was absolutely impressed on how the story went together to the very touching ending, in which I had tears in my eyes and quite emotional for a long time afterwards. Just a well put-together story for all.",1127260800,3,349,4.384615384615385
452878,5,6302327725,"We used to check this out from our local library on 16mm film when I was a child in the early to mid- 70s and I have never forgotten it! The songs are great... ""Building a Wall"" still rings in my ears. I can't wait to share this with my own daughter!",1083888000,6,250,3.826923076923077
452879,5,6302327725,I remember this version being televised in the UK a couple of times in the 1980's and I absolutely loved it both the animation and the soundtrack. I would love to obtain a copy if it was ever re-released and can only hope that it will be.,1072483200,5,238,4.085106382978723
452880,5,6302327725,I searched far and wide to find this video for over a year. It was broadcast on British TV in the 1980s and I copied it for my eldest girls. Unfortunately the tape was erased and when my youngest daughter came along I regretted losing such a lovely film. I never thought I would ever be able to find it again and when I came across a copy from Out Of Print Video through Amazon.com I literally cried with pleasure! The film was  speedily shipped to me in the UK and I feel very priviledged to be able to enjoy The Selfish Giant again with my youngest daughter and my now four Grandchildren.,1039478400,7,590,4.221238938053097
452881,5,6302327725,this is such a moving story that i can not watch it without crying and the music is so good how can anyone be so nasty to children but at leasts he repents and learns his lesson most of us do things to other people then regret it later so buy and learn a story for young and the not so young,1022284800,2,291,3.7096774193548385
452882,5,6302327725,This is one of those films that stays with you for all of your life-like Mary Martin's Peter Pan. It is the desire of my heart for it not to be lost to present and future generations. Please consider a re-release so that it will not be.,987724800,3,236,4.042553191489362
7824258,3,6302327725,"Was hoping to get it in DVD form, however the video tape was indeed in great condition and worth the purchase price, thank you!",1480723200,,127,4.333333333333333
7824259,5,6302327725,We looked for a number of years to find this treasure.  Wonderful story for all ages of people.,1427068800,,95,4.277777777777778
7824260,5,6302327725,Great.,1412380800,,6,6.0
7824261,5,6302327725,"This is the original version with music by the Kings' Singers. I watched this with my own children and so wanted my granddaughter to see it too. She loved it ( age 5 ) but this can be enjoyed by anyone from 5 to 95.

Arrived on time and well packaged.",1408579200,,251,3.9215686274509802
7824262,5,6302327725,I watched this animated movie when I was younger and was thrilled to find it again. I still enjoy the story--share now with my kids.,1387065600,,132,4.32
7824263,5,6302327725,"So happy to receive this video, it is the most beautiful animated version of this story by Oscar Wilde and I am so grateful that I could access a rare copy of it through Amazon as it is no longer available.",1296777600,,206,4.048780487804878
7824264,5,6302327725,I had already seen this short film many years ago.  I enjoyed it then and that is why I ordered it.  I was very satisfied with the product and the service.  The tape arrived much sooner than I had expected.,1240704000,,206,4.1
7824265,5,6302327725,"I am struck by how, like me, many reviewers saw this when it was aired once in the 70s and it stuck with them 30+ years later.  I managed to find this on VHS a few years ago at a local video store and was amazed at how well I had remembered it, including the beautiful song ""Dreams Grow Older"" that is played in the story.  I hope someone will release it on DVD- it certainly deserves it!",1192579200,2,388,3.9615384615384617
7824266,5,6302327725,"I remember seeing this on the Disney channel in the early 1980's and taped it on VHS, but eventually the tape wore out.  This story epitomizes the unselfish actions that should be a part of all Christians' lives, and the consequences of its opposite.  Considering the lifestyle and actions of the author of this story, its message is a timeless one and should be required watching for all children, young and old alike.  The soundtrack is excellent, and the music as performed by the King's Singers is indeed appropriate and moving.  I highly recommend this tape to all who hold moral values in high esteem, and to those who enjoy a wonderful story that is appropriate for all ages.  My only gripe is that it has not been released on DVD, which hopefully will be done in the near future.",1185840000,2,787,4.5928571428571425
7824267,5,6302327725,"I too saw the Selfish Giant when I was a kid.  This tale was extremely important to me...the video contains excellent animation and beautiful storytelling. The folk songs are so moving- I can't tell you how overjoyed I was when my kids put in Classic Fairy Tales from the local library and this was at the end! I can only hope that this will be re-released- I would recommend ANY parent sharing this with their children!!!
