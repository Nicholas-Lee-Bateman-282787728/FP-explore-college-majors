2284390,5,B0009ETD64,"I'm a huge fan of 1970s grindhouse films, so this movie is among my favorites.  It has a great soundtrack when the killer sacrifices his victims, and the entire movie has a big 70s type feel to it. The gore scenes when the women are sacrificed on the alter are very graphic, even though the effects are very low budget.  An interview on the disc reveals that they used cow hearts for the scenes; stuff like this is typical of grindhouse films.  There's also a lot of nudity with good looking women that includes full frontal, a funny scene with a rhyming pimp, and real scenes of Mardi Gras during the 70s.  Whether or not you consider it a slow film is going to depend on your taste for 70s films; I personally thought it moved pretty fast, even though it doesn't have a huge body count. The lack of atmosphere and suspense may also be a problem with some people. The bottom line is that this film isn't for everyone.  If you watch mainly mainstream horror you might not like it, but if you like horror films from the 70s and some films from Joe D' Amato, you might enjoy it.

This is mastered from a VHS master. Before the film starts, there's a message about the quality. However, I thought it looked really good for something that was mastered from a VHS master. It has some problems in terms of sharpness, but it has good color and contrast. Brightness is fine, and the picture is clean looking. The DVD menu screen has that great music playing, but the disc has no chapter stops.",1322524800,3,1485,4.381818181818182

2284392,5,B0009ETD64,"This one is finally out in a non bootleg form,the music and throbbing score when the priest emerges masked from behind the curtain to torture is amazing,creepiest music and a pounding disco bass makes the scenes worth the price of admission. The ending is terrible and ruins the film,but the last victim tortured does a strange innocent naked little dance for the killer and he asks her to leave this place quickly. She repels his wish and says ""You've paid good money for me,lets get it on"" Totally insane movie,only could have been made in the satanic seventies,captures the spirit of 1977 and 1978 when life was a surreal endless party,unfortunatly it ended and were stuck in a fabricated unfun controlled world now.",1317859200,30,719,4.853658536585366

If you liked the films shown by ""Elvira, Mistress of the Dark"", or ""Chiller"" then this is what you want. If you can't see the humor in a really bad low budget horror film, then this is not for you.",1194220800,,246,3.94

8059712,1,B0009ETD64,this version is a poor quality VHS transfer. If you are looking for a DVD quality get the version from Code Red instead.,1396224000,,120,4.260869565217392

8059714,4,B0009ETD64,"When you think of the term Grindhouse, or Drive in Sleaze, well  Mardi Gras Massacre fits the bill . This very low budget flick delivers exactly what you would expect from 70s exploitationa cinema. The actors mostly sound as if reading lines from cue cards, most scenes are shot on the streets, taking advantage of ""free"" locations that actually help the feel of the movie a bit. There is plenty of nudity,and I think every single female in this played hookers. Anyway, the killings are all the same, every time the guy did the same ritual, wich by the third time really has you rolling your eyes. During the Mardi Gras scenes you can tell alot of the people on film were NOT part of the movie and were hamming it up for the camera. The story rolls along fairly slowly, if you can call it a story. A cop falls for a hooker with a heart of gold... Blah blah  blah..there is even a love montage, of them strolling thru the park holding hands, and junk! Then they break up, she gets drunk and has a dance scene in a disco! NOTE: (the gay guy wearing a leatard in the disco is a hoot!) And there is alot of Disco music in this movie, I mean alot!! Be careful not to catch yourself half way thru the movie holding your arm up in the air like John Travolta!!! You can tell this is a really dated movie,because in one scene the cops are in a local shop questioning people, and there is a huge sign advertising WINE SKINS SOLD HERE.  What the heck is a wine skin?!",1325894400,6,1456,4.23021582733813
8059715,1,B0009ETD64,"This movie titled 'Mardis Gras Massacre' had to be one of the worst movies that I have ever had to sit through. I live very close to the city of New Orleans and I am from the state of Louisiana also. When I was in Jr. High School and High School I was in the High School band and we went to New Orleans every year for many days in order to march in the parades so it is not like I have never been to Mardis Gras. This movie had to be as far from being real as anything could ever get. I really could not believe how fake most of the murder scenes actually looked. This was an absolute waste of both time and money, No Doubt!!!",1324512000,,626,3.86046511627907
8059716,2,B0009ETD64,"I applaud Code Red DVD for releasing this kind of movie and adding a horror host to present them.  I have no regrets buying it, but jeez, this movie is not very good at all.  The same kill scenes are repeated, the direction of the movie is horribly inept, and it frankly hurts to watch it.  It's not a fun cheesy movie, it plain stinks.  ""Night of the Demon"" is much better, but that's like saying getting punched in the nuts is a little better than getting kicked in the nuts.  It all depends on your threshold for bad movies, and Mardis Gras Massacre tests it.

I enjoy ""Blood Feast,"" ""Gore Gore Girls,"" and movies like that, but this doesn't belong in that category. It's not so bad it's funny, it's so bad it's, well, bad.

Keep releasing these movies, though, Code Red, because I love collecting these strange pieces of cinema.",1322697600,6,832,4.434210526315789
