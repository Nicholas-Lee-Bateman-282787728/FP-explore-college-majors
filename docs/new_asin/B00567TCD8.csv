4586584,5,B00567TCD8,"First impression, and only one.

This BD is perfect for the average to above average home theater enthusiast who wants to check and even calibrate their video and audio of their home theater.  This disc helped me fix a display problem I never knew I had since purchasing my 47""-LCD three years ago.  Now I wonder how I watched tv with the display set incorrectly.

I have yet to try and calibrate the system since my receiver supposedly does that for you...which I have done.

If you have never had or calibrated your home theater display this is definitely worth it. The beginner portion of the calbiration is super easy to use and the explanations are straight forward as far as what you are supposed to be looking for.",1290902400,12,721,4.558139534883721
4586585,5,B00567TCD8,"If you've recently purchased or own an LCD, LED, Plasma, or DLP television, buy this Blu-Ray. Disney's calibration disc is very user friendly and easy to use. As the previous reviewer did, my TV was already calibrated from settings I found on CNET and AVSForum. I was interested to see how my settings compared to the settings changed using this Blu-Ray. My already tweaked settings were pretty close to the settings after calibrating my TV from the blu-ray. I just had to tweak a few things. Regardless, I still give this disc 5 stars. The directions are very easy to follow, plus the blu-ray comes with an instruction booklet. I recommend reading the instruction booklet before using the blu-ray to calibrate your television.

The blu-ray is very easy to navigate. If you need to return to a previous step, it's very easy to do so. After you calibrate your television, there are clips from several Disney movies such as Bolt and Pirates of the Caribbean to view your settings in action. The second disc on the blu-ray called Visions: Inspired By Nature is a stunning HD demo reel. There are scenes of waterfalls, an ocean sunset, flower fields, desert vistas, mountain vistas, a fireplace scene, plus more. You can play each individual scene or run a loop. The second disc is approximately 64 minutes long. The second disc is something you can play in the background if you are having guests over or play it while reading a book or just relaxing.

Overall, I highly recommend this to anyone who owns a high def television who hasn't tweaked their settings. You will learn which each setting on your television does and it learn about surround sound. Like the previous reviewer stated, If you have already calibrated your TV from settings you found online, this disc probably won't help you every much.",1289606400,113,1803,4.794212218649518
4586586,5,B00567TCD8,"Recently purchased a 55"" Samsung UN55C6800 LED TV and was looking for a calibration disc. I was about the purchase the DVE HD Basics Blu-Ray but saw a press release concerning this DVD, so I decided to wait until this one came out and give it a go.

I will preface this by saying I had already used calibrated settings from CNET as well as users on the AVS forums to tweak my TV already. Before using the WoW Blu-Ray I would say I was about 95% satisfied with the picture my TV delivered using the settings I found online.  The main reason I bought the blu-ray is I was just interested in seeing all the (albeit non-professional) test patterns used to calibrate a TV and so forth. I went in to this purchase not expecting any vast improvements in Picture Quality over my already somewhat tweaked settings. I know this disc is no substitute for a ISF professional calibration and was not expecting such results.

First, for people who haven't purchased, head over to Disney's website and search for this blu-ray. On its Disney page, you'll find at the bottom a link to download the ""WoW Technical Manual."" This is basically an instruction booklet on how to use the blu-ray, and I found it to be a nice read before I actually received the blu-ray itself. It goes over a lot of the test patterns and how they work.

Here are the contents of the blu-ray:

So....how did it work for me?

First, I love the included manual. Very well written and easy to use. Also, this blu-ray comes with a blue filter gel used to calibrate your colors. (I believe the DVE Blu-Ray also comes with color gels).

The actual DVD menus are wonderful too. Each test pattern has three sections: Overview (description of whay the particular TV setting is important), Instructions (shows the test pattern and clearly talks about how to use it), and finally just the  test pattern itself, allowing you to tweak and take as long as you want.

Depending on how familiar you already are with your TV and if you wanted to watch the ""Discover""  portion of the disc, you can expect to spend anywhere from 1 hour to a few hours with the disc. There is a second included disc called Visions that has a bunch of nature scenery/etc  to show off your TV. I did not care for the second disc, but i could see how someone could enjoy it.

At the end of the day, after running through all the tests  (some multiple times because other tests later on may change your initial settings), I only changed two settings on my current set-up, and they were very small changes at that.  I was disappointed that my settings didn't change too much, but like i said in the beginning I was already very happy with my TV's picture using settings I found online.

For what it is (an average-joe TV calibration blu-ray), this product is wonderful. I highly recommend it for people purchasing their first HDTV as it thoroughly discusses everything a person new to the technology would need to know. If you are the type of person who buys a new TV and starts watching it day 1 on the default settings, this dvd may help a LOT. However, for those who already play around with settings,  consumer calibration dvds such as this one will probably not help all that much - especially since we can get decent settings online already from professional review sites or forums.

However, since I am rating the product, it undoubtedly deserves 5 stars. Easy to navigate, well produced, professional, etc. Just understand that if you've already tweaked your TV settings using information you've gathered online, this dvd may not bring that much of a change to your picture settings!",1288915200,666,4561,4.80306905370844

We noticed the tests ""paused"" the disc during calibration tests so I hit ""play"" on my 2nd attempt at advancing. Same result. FBI warning, Disney intro, etc.

We tried a third time by returning to menu. Same result.

I then put the DVD in my Xbox One player, with hope that it would work. ""Play"", RB, LB, X, Y, A, B... they all bugged out the disc and abruptly sent me back to the Xbox One home screen.

There were times that the directions were not the easiest to follow, but that was when the TV was calibrated close enough that they didn't make sense right away. An adjustment way out of band, showed more of what they were talking about, and the directions then made way more sense.

That is the instruction is in the same video stream as the settings. With the WOW you have to watch the explanation of the procedure then go back and select the calibrate option and try to remember the procedure while you try to find the setting on the tv. I can't imagine ever using the next level of the 3 levels of calibration that the WOW provides. I suspect it's a ""very good"" disc, but all I need is a ""good enough"" one.",1466812800,3,926,4.065573770491803

It's a very good calibration tool with instructions on how to use it with basic and advanced settings. The people on my new tv don't look like they are having heat stroke and red and flushed anymore, it's not perfect but its a lot better.

However the basic tool to correct color is crap - it just shows you pictures and tells you to adjust what looks good to you - which isn't very accurate.  I recommend searching for AVS HD 709 and using the Color Steps test (Adjust color until you can see a different shade in the red, yellow and blue bars for every section). It's much more accurate. Fortunately my eyes seem to be good, I came up with the same color number using that test along with Disney's however if you can't tell colors as well the AVS is more accurate.

(Sure it does come with a more accurate advanced test but I'm not bothering with the advanced stuff holding up colored plastic to my eyes.)

It's an older set ( about 6 years), so I thought I'd try this disc since it has a ""pixel flipper"" setting which says it helps or fixes burn in and ghost images.  I ran the pixel flipper for 3 hours - nothing better, so I left it on overnight ( as per the instructions).  The next day I turned the set on and not only did we have BAD burn - we now had ghost images too!  Sigh!

I'm not sure how this would create an impression that although it is a bit useless for me, it could do wonders to some. I would like to stress that in today's technology (2016), there are hundreds of calibration and advise about optimization of your audio/video adjustments. I had an old amplifier before that this bluray did manage to help me calibrate it. Fortunately for me, I already have upgraded to a newer amplifier/receiver that has its calibration system components.

If you don't adjust settings in the TV *and* connected components, it can make your eyes buggy from over-sharpened images, punched-up images, compression artifacts, scaling artifacts, and green faces. It can distract you with poor lip sync.

WOW really works for calibrating an HTDV so it'll look good, sync audio with video, and go easy on your eyes. It comes with a blue filter to use when adjusting color. WOW is more comprehensive than the Android app ""THX Tune-up"" and led to somewhat different levels for some settings.

Some settings are interdependent and subtle, so take your time, iterate, and experiment. I found that setting TiVo to emit PCM audio instead of Dolby Digital audio enabled my A/V receiver to adjust audio delay for lip sync.

A couple of the audio adjustments require a Sound Pressure Level meter. No problem: Use a mobile phone app like ""Smart Tools.""",1453075200,,1114,4.9411764705882355

Once you have a good understanding of each evaluation screen you can calibrate any monitor within 10 minutes.

Calibrate the color tint/hue/color after you've gotten the brightness, contrast, and backlight where you like them. Don't worry about advanced color settings. Set your color temperature to warm. I know medium or normal seems more real but once calibrated it doesn't represent the tone filmmakers work with.

Out of all the calibration discs I own, I always come back to this one for the basics.  I prefer setting contrast, brightness, and sharpness with this disc.

I like the navigation of the disc.  Once it loads it is fast and easy.

Unfortunately though, for some reason this disc takes forever to load.  My blu-ray player is an Oppo BDP-103 and is known for its fast loading times but this is by far the slowest disc to load I own, from any category.

The test patterns are not as complete as Spears & Munsil 2, which I also own and love.  However, I still consider Spears & Munsil second to this calibration disc due to its complexity and tons of patterns that are not even usable without additional equipment.

Knowing what I know now about all of the test discs in existence as of today (Purchased this disc in 2011 and am leaving this review in 2015) I would absolutely recommend this as your first or even only calibration/test disc.

Just make sure to grab a snack while it loads.",1445990400,,1127,4.400966183574879
4586737,5,B00567TCD8,"bought this primarily for the Pixel Flipper video that will remove ""persistent"" (sometimes called ""burnt"") images from LCD panels (HDTV's).  It does work.  However, it may take as little as a few hours to a full day or more to remove the persistent (bunt) image.  You can still stop the video to watch TV in between, but you may need to play the video when not watching the TV so that it can take the time to remove the image. Overnight is a good time and even ALL DAY while you are out.  Again, it may take a few days of 8 hours one day, 6 hours the next, etc. since you may need to interrupt the pixel flipper to watch TV.  And of course, do NOT do the same thing that got the image (burnt) persistent on your display in the first place.",1445817600,,739,4.104166666666667

In the past I would look up calibration settings for the model tv I had, decided which one I like best and called it a day. After using this disk I can honestly say that although my 60 Panasonic plasma looked good before, it looks great now. It is extremely easy to use and Disney does a great job breaking everything down, showing you what to look for and how to make the adjustments.

I'm gad I went with WOW instead of the Spears and Munsil disk as it provided me with the insight I need to confidently know what Im doing.  I am curious on how much of a difference the Spears and Munsil calibration disk will make if I pick it up. It would probably allow me to fine tune my settings even more and I may get it down the road, but no regrets with WOW.",1445817600,,862,4.094674556213017

4586742,2,B00567TCD8,"I can't imagine how this would get positive reviews from anybody using this for audio calibration. I've never seen such a frustrating user interface.

For example: the portion where you can measure the noise floor of your speakers. It gives you five frequencies and a series of decreasing dB levels to test those frequencies at. Nevermind the annoyance that the frequencies are out of order, which is merely annoying to a nit picker like me (they go something like 1KHz, 4KHz, 8KHz, 240Hz, 60Hz - why go the opposite way at the end there? ugh). The real annoying part is that there is absolutely no indication of how to select a different speaker! The test starts with the front left, and I can't for the life of me figure out how to switch to any other speaker. Everything in the interface is usually controlled via the directional arrows and the select button on your bluray remote. But nothing works to get it to move to another speaker. Nothing at all. Perhaps there's a way to do it, but if there is one, there is absolutely no on-screen indication of what it is. Simply terrible UI design, not to mention the test screens are pretty ugly.

One more thing: I would have asked how to switch speakers, but for some reason Amazon isn't allowing customers to ask questions about this product... that's odd...",1444953600,,1309,4.637931034482759

I've used/tested 4-5 different tuning disks and this one does the best job of explaining each test and what your TV needs to look like to tune it properly. (My second choice  is Spears and Munsil HD benchmark, but they don't explain things as well and, honestly, they just have too many darn tests on that disk, making it harder to use).

This Disney WOW tuning disk  is AWESOME for beginners with no idea of how to tune a TV.  It is also excellent for advanced users.

Once you've gone through all of the basic tests,  i suggest you do the advanced test for overscan (this one really makes a difference, if you can adjust these settings).  after that you are done!

Not all TV's have the same adjust-ability, but i've seen improvements on every TV i've used this on (even my own 65"" HDTV that was previously tuned with one of the other competitors disks showed an improvement-- albeit a small improvement in crispness, due to that overscan test).

To paraphrase a line from the Ratatouille trailer - ""Once you muscle your way past the gag reflex, it's surprisingly good"". Though I have calibrated my own and friends' home theaters for years, and consider myself fairly advanced at the task, this disc works great for me. And to its credit, it is presented in a manner that lets you choose whether to let Goofy explain the basics and walk you through the process  or to skip to intermediate or advanced sections without wasting your time (and pride) listening to Goofy. And it's more than just a Blu-ray DVD. It includes a blue-filter viewer for performing chroma set-up, as well as a 53-page illustrated manual for reference. I'd say that WOW: World of Wonder is unquestionably just the thing for 98% of all people wishing to optimize a home theater.

I bought this with a friend and they thought it was well explained, and made you feel like an idiot (at least at the beginning) but the 2nd disc was full of interesting material, as well as the trailers for other Disney discs. The sound section was not as useful but they were happy with the resulting picture they now have. It doesn't allow you to set your 3D picture but I never understood why you would want to do it.

It just has you looking at 3 images and adjusting the color and hue until it looks right to you. Using the advanced mode the more accurate color was actually 53 and hue +1. May not be a big deal for a lot of people but I wanted the most accurate picture I could get with the new TV. It was actually kind of fun to use. Also needed to adjust the lip sync, which surprised me as I do not have the TV hooked up to a home theater, but was able to get it right using the audio settings, unexpected bonus there.

4586926,5,B00567TCD8,"I would highly recommend this product.  I spent some good money on a 75 inch Samsung 1080p LED tv to upgrade from a really old LCD rear projection model.  Even uncalibrated, the upgrade in picture quality totally blew me away.  I then calibrated with this disc, and I was truly blown away again by the improvement.  I'm sure I could spend a ton of money to have a professional come in with fancy equipment to make it even better, but I also could have spent a ton more money on a 4K unit.  If I had an unlimited budget or I felt compelled to have better specs than my neighbor, then sure.

I spent about three hours going through the process the first time.  I feel that I wasted a lot of time going through the ""Beginner"" mode.  My thinking was that I wanted to gain every possible advantage by going through everything.  If you're competent enough to set up your own HDTV, then you'll have no trouble with the advanced mode.  You can fine tune every detail to perfection.  I calibrated a second tv, and it only took me 15 minutes because I knew exactly what to do.

After you complete the calibration, go through and do it at least one more time, maybe two.  Every setting influences the other settings.  It'll throw some things off.  Plus, you'll probably find things you missed the first time.

The blue glasses worked even better than I expected from a cheap piece of plastic.  It really does do a great job of getting the color details just right.

The audio sync function is good.  Just be aware that sync between your blu-ray player and tv will be different timing than watching content directly from a smart tv.

My tv came shipped with one stuck pixel in a corner.  I didn't even notice until I got really close and discovered it.  Although the screen had 2,073,599 perfectly working pixels, that one really bothered me.  I was very pleased to discover that this disc has a tool that has the ability to fix stuck pixels.  That feature itself makes this disc totally worth the $18 price tag.

The 2-Disc version.  Eh... just go with the 1-Disc version.  After I finished calibrating my tv, I threw in the second disc and got bored pretty quickly.  What I really care about is how MY movies look on a calibrated tv.  If you want to spend the extra $3 on the deluxe version that's your choice, but unless you want to put your tv in a ""demo"" mode to sell, you probably won't ever use it for anything practical.

This is slightly off topic, but the motion smoothing feature offered on LCD and LED tv's is total nonsense.  Turn it off completely, trust me.  It makes the image unnaturally smooth to the point where it is hard to watch.  If you don't want to take my word for it, do a Google search on ""Soap Opera Effect"".

I only have one complaint about this product.  Whenever I watch other people's TVs that haven't been calibrated and still have motion smoothing turned on, it looks even worse now that I know what it should look like. ;)",1423353600,4,2946,4.402597402597403

I found it very cumbersome to finish one adjustment and then try to get back to the menu to begin the next. To give only one example; there is an adjustment - ""colour"" - for which the manual says we should use the two on screen pictures to make adjustments. Well I could never find a way to move to the second picture after making adjustments to enhance the first.

I suspect this could be a very helpful tool if only you can unlock the ""secret code"" to easily and quickly jump between the various adjustment menus, because very often an adjustment in one area may require one to go back and re-adjust some other area.  But, I never could. I tried to find help on Disney's WOW web page, but that was a waste of time.

All in all, the packaging is great, from the actual Blu-ray disc package to the menus and presentation within the disc.

The step by step instructions are very clear (though not always concise) and really help you walk through perfectly (without instruments beyond the lovely included blue filter) setting up your television set.  The only reason this review isn't a 5* one is due to the fact that the THX Optimizer and/or Xbox One calibration setup really get you pretty close to what this disc can get you to.  The blue filter is great to have and the walkthrough is important, but if you're an intermediate / advanced user as it is, you likely won't get much more out of your set by buying this over your currently used ""calibration"" options.

4586986,5,B00567TCD8,"my tv looks way better now. its most noticable when i go to someone elses house and i cant wait to go home.

Tvs come from the store with setting that look good in a large building with fluorescent lights so it can sell but and are NOT set correctly for your own home. they are often way too bright and far too vivid. and this means inaccuracy.
what this disk is meant to do, is to help you understand what different A/V terms truly mean, like sharpness contrast resolution and on and on. it then has test sequences to help you tun your tv to what it should be. color filters to adjust it, even if you are color blind like myself.

remember a tv that is ""vivid"" may be terribly inaccurate and won't display what was intended by the movie director or game developer.

i do have two warnings regarding this disk though.
1. you will discover that some tvs have very locked down setting that do not allow the end user to fully adjust the tv. do you know what automatic contrast ratio is? well it should be off. and i have discovered that some tvs will reduce auto contraster when you turn that feature off rather than actually turning it off. remember vividness sells tvs. accuracy does not. so some manufacturers lock down the settings. i bought and returned 3 tvs before i ended up with the one i have. and no. your really nice 1500 dollar tv does not mean its the best. i found that the big money tvs were the hardest or impossible to set and had to be returned they are charging money for their vividness after all.

4587001,4,B00567TCD8,"I was skeptical at first buying this product, considering it was Disney, I questioned just how professional it may be. I was debating between this one and the DVE HD Basic configuration disc. Overall, I went with this one by judgment of reading the previous reviews and the ratio of good reviews compared to the DVE Disc.
Overall, I am a tech savvy person, I have been working in the technical realm for over 8 years now. This configuration disc does the job, and the results are WoW, very noticeable. I am completely satisfied with my purchase. This disc can be used for LCD, Plasma, OLED, CRT, and even projectors for configuration.
The discovery portion of the disc goes through learning HD basics. It walks you through how to connect your system, to screen size, to how far to sit from the system, and many more informational tips.  If you are tech savvy, you can skip through the discover portion and go straight to the optimization menu.
From here, you can go to the basic / easy optimization menu. The menu walks you through step-by-step of each configuration setting, ranging from brightness, contrasts, sharpness, color and hue, and others. Each section is broken down into subsections. For instance, the brightness section is broken down into explanation, then instructions, then calibrate. The instructions are clear, concise, and to the point and tell you exactly what you need to look for in order to make changes to your television. Finally, you go to the calibration section and the displayed reference chart is displayed for you to make your changes to your system.
The advanced optimization goes a little deeper into making changes, and the instructions here are very well explained. I recommend doing the basic / beginner settings first, then make the advanced changes.
The audio tuner helps to make sure that your audio is in sync with the video. If you have an A/V system connected, you will have to make the changes on that vs. your TV.
Once you finally get everything tuned, I recommend taking a picture on your phone of your settings. If your power goes out, your TV will reset to factory conditions. This makes for easy configuration of your system again vs. running the whole disc again. Once your system is finally tuned, there is an experience section of the disc that will display Disney snippets of HD movies so you can see the difference.
Overall, I am very pleased with this product. The instructions were very simple to understand, and applying them to the overall calibration of my 70 Sony TV was easy. The end result was a very noticeable difference in overall color and HD display. Even though the product is made by Disney, the results are professional and very easy to configure for any user.

- Can skip the voice instructions and go straight to the calibration tests

- Hitting buttons back and forth to frequently switch between different calibration tests, because calibrating in one test might disturb calibration in another test.

I found some surprising issues during calibration with my audio setup (which has been there for four years...) .. the audio turned out to be 160ms out of sync!  Once I saw this, I dug out my Pioneer's manual and built in a 160ms sync delay and now everything is PERFECT.

The ONLY issue I have with this product is that it lacks 3D calibration suites.  But I don't mark the stars down because it wasn't expected to be there.  Just wish it were.

4587070,5,B00567TCD8,"I just purchased a new flat screen TV and wanted to optimize the picture without paying an arm and a leg for a professional. I had read several blogs giving picture settings for my TV but I was wary that the settings might not be the right settings for my situation. I read several positive reviews of this disk and thought that it might do the trick and it isn't very expensive.

The title of the disk is right on: WOW. This disk has made a huge difference in the quality of my picture. The beginner section gets you to a pretty good picture. The more advanced sections really allow you to optimize the quality. Spend the time with the explanations and the examples before you start optimizing. You really learn a lot about what brightness, contrast, color and hue (tint) and sharpness really mean. Brightness allows you to maximize the detail in dark sections of the picture. Contrast allows you to maximize the detail in the white sections of the picture. The color and hue adjustments with the provided filter allow you to really get the colors ""right"". You learn about black and white clipping, and why that matters. The picture on my set is now WOW. I am amazed by the difference. I can see so much more detail in the dark and light areas of the picture. The settings that I tried from blogs that I read were not even close. Part of the reason is that you need to do the optimization in the environment that you will be watching in.

Get this disk. Use it on a Blue-ray player with HDMI inputs. Once I went through the full setup, I was able to adjust other sets in my house much more quickly. I performed the optimization on my mother-in-law's set and she was amazed at what a difference it made. WOW, I pleased my mother-in-law. What could be better praise than that?

This disk does not take the place of a professional, but IMHO it gets you 90% of the way there. It does not cover all of the adjustments possible, like motion control. But you can read up on that from various blogs. What this disk does do is to get your TV picture to an excellent level of brightness, contrast, color, hue, and sharpness. If you want to tweak it from there for your own personal taste at least you have a good starting point. I am very impressed.",1410393600,5,2240,4.3798076923076925

The S & M disk is probably a better choice for the serious videophile. The problem I have with either one of them is that it really does take some dedication and devotion to work your way through an entire evaluation/calibration.  You must be thoroughly familiar with the disk in order to get proper results, and this takes time and study. WOW has some features that the S&M lacks, and vice-versa. So you can't really get it all with one disk.  Can I tell the difference after using this?  Well, today's TV's are pretty automatic, and you really don't hear many complaints about the picture anyway.

4587146,4,B00567TCD8,"Before purchasing this disc I had gone online and searched for settings for my LG LED 3D TV. I had used those settings for several months, but it wondered if a detailed system might achieve an even better picture for my particular set.

The descriptions of the technology on the intro portion of this disc are very basic. These videos would be best for people who bought a new set on sale (Black Friday for instance,) or someone who is considering a new purchase but doesn't know the differences between LCD, LED, Plasma, DVD and Blu-Ray, etc. To be honest, the very basic info would likely only be revealing to those who have not done any research at all. My parents, seniors with no time or patience for online research, would probably learn what they needed to at least understand the differences on the tags describing sets at the big box stores.

As for the usefulness of the disc for actually making adjustments to the settings on an existing set, it depends on how much time you want to put into it. When I went through the basic set up, no changes were made to the settings I found online for my set. When I went into the advanced settings there were a few minor adjustments that may help slightly, but overall the online codes were very close to my final settings.

So, bottom line, for those who aren't interested in seeking out detailed settings for their model set online, the disc would probably be much more useful and helpful. This disc would be a great idea for my parents, or for my technology-phobic friends, but it didn't make enough difference in the settings from the online forums to justify the expense to me.",1402185600,,1632,4.54421768707483

Out of the box I noted the TV's colors were too strong for my eyes, so this Wow: World of Wonder disc really helped me to tweak things to my liking. I used the Beginner tools and got a basic calibration accomplished in about 30 minutes.

I especially liked that for each change there was a description, instructions and the tool. This made things clearer and helped me decide if I could skip that step, which I did with some of them.

After calibrating my TV with the disc,  I then took a look at some scenes on the disc with my new settings. I was especially happy with the animated ones as they were amazing! Great color, details and overall picture quality with a few adjustments being made while using the tools on this disc.

I have gone back and attempted some of the Advanced settings, but really didn't need too many of them after the basic calibration, which was nice as they are more labor intensive in terms of time and attention to detail.  They would however, tell you if your TV was experiencing major issues and needed repair - which is good to know.

There are calibration tools specific to different kinds of displays (LCD, DLP, etc...) which was unexpected, but gave more value to the disc in my opinion. I plan on using this disc to calibrate my plasma and perhaps my desktop's LED monitor as well.

While some may balk at the cost of this disc (I got it for fifteen shipped...), I think it's a good way to get the most out of your high definition display. I use my TV in a lot of different ways (PC monitor, streaming media, and over air broadcast TV - I wrote&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Simple-Guide-to-Over-the-Air-Free-TV/dp/B00JT51P8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Simple Guide to Over-the-Air Free TV</a>) so it's important to me that it look the best it can for multiple uses - thus the desire for calibration.

This is a great fine tuning tool, but admittedly it isn't for everyone. However, those looking for a calibration disc will find this one very useful.

NOTE: If the light in the room that you're viewing your TV changes from when you calibrated the TV, you may need to re-calibrate to get optimum viewing yet again.  This may also be the case if the source of your viewing changes. Going from cable TV to streaming from Netflix for example.",1401580800,3,2613,5.12235294117647

Because of this you want to go through the settings multiple times to make sure that the previous setting is still correct after you change the next setting.

Since I really didn't want to spend 200 dollars on someone coming and mixing up my settings I researched and saw this was one of the best do it yourselves in the market.
Inside you'll find the Blu-ray (Use with a PS3 or 4, Xbox One really wasn't that great imo) an instruction manual for deeper tutorials and a blue eye patch for the advanced settings.

The beginners tutorial is pretty quick and easy, it took roughly 20 minutes to go through the instructions and try it myself. However I didn't feel very satisfied with my results so I actually reset my TV to it's defaults and tried the advanced side.

The Advanced settings is what I truly recommend. It goes a bit more indepth than the beginners level, and for me, much easier to use.
This setting requires the blue eye patch which helps adjust color and tint levels and man did that help. On a side note, this Advanced setting can take up to 40-50 minutes as it'll recquire you to go back and forth to previous setting to make adjustments, namely in the black and white levels. I went back 5 times to make sure my levels were correct.

Experienced Settings really needs someone with the proper equipment and professional knowledge to really amp your TV up. However if you're not careful you'll have to go back to your defaults and do it over.

So again, i recommend the advanced settings.

After you're done the Blu-ray gives you samples of their various films to see if the levels work well for you. You can always go back and adjust, but if you send the time and be really careful you'll only need to do this one time.

Once I calibrated my TV I popped in TRON LEGACY as it's one of the best films I have on Blu-ray and the amount of detail, color, definition and sharpness was almost to the levels you get from a real theater.

Did a reasonable job on my laptop and LCD TV, much more limited on my projector (to be fair it does say projectors might not have enough contrast to make full use of the software).

All in all, it did a good enough job in calibrating my displays, but I'm not sure why this is more than $10-$15 since what I could use wound up effectively being 3 pictures (one each for contrast, white balance and color).  The contrast and white balance are animated for reduce eye fatigue, but are basically pictures that flash periodically.

I've done a L-O-T of reading on the avs forums on my particular LCD...used some of the users' settings, then tweaked them to my liking.

Everyone sees things differently...and you certainly can't let store settings be your benchmark.  Most Big Box stores have the TVs in the back of the store, but the color/brightness settings are cranked up SOOOOOO high, you feel the heat off the panel when you walk in the front door.

I have gone through most of the tests/calibrations on the disc, and to be honest...the results that I get after doing so aren't much (if at all) different from those that I came up with on my own.

It also 'sees' my 7.1 Surround as a different configuration than both I and my AVR see it as...I wonder who's correct...

I'm not totally dismissing this as junk...especially for the tl;dnr crowd who don't want to actually LOOK for the answer or come up with it for themselves, although...for those folks...this would most likely be too tedious to do anyway.

Bottom line is - it came to the same conclusion(s) that I already had.  I don't consider it a waste of $ because it confirms what I had come up with.  If you're already happy with what you've got - why spend money?  If you want a 2nd opinion...it's an inexpensive one.

4587224,5,B00567TCD8,"I've been a home theater enthusiast for many years, and have used various calibration tools in that time. I was looking for a new one to test my HD setup(my existing one was DVD based, not Blu-ray). I really wasn't put off by the Disney label, or the 'Goofy' character that appears on the cover. I purchased this based on the mostly favorable reviews on Amazon, and I was not disappointed. This is an excellent home theater calibration tool - for both casual and more advanced users.

I spent about an hour (so far) with it, and made some noticeable tweaks to my picture and sound.

Picture: The disc walks you through numerous tests to adjust the settings on you television/monitor for optimal viewing. In my case, the nature of the picture adjustments that I ended up changing were mainly setting brightness(dark levels) and picture/contrast(white levels). - Most monitors are shipped from the factory with very high brightness settings - mainly so that the screens will look great in brightly lit stores.  These calibration tests will help you to dial in those settings perfectly for your room and lighting level.

Sound: The disc also has tests to adjust for sound - to verify speaker placement, polarity, and level. The level test is particularly useful.. especially if you use a sound meter (you can turn your iPhone/iPad/Android device into a Sound Pressure Level meter for .99).. you will get a very nicely balanced sound field and enjoy maximum surround sound goodness!

These tests are mainly the 'beginner' level tests, and these tests will likely be sufficient for most users. For those who want to go deeper, there are advanced versions of these tests as well. For instance, there is a much more detailed version of the brightness test - but adjusting the brightness to this exacting level will really only make sense if the lighting in the room will not change at all. This is usually not the case for most of us, unless you have a room with not windows and the lights are always set the same way when you watch TV - but if you do.. this disc will help you really fine tune these settings.

This is a slick product - polished, and it's clear some thought went into developing these calibration tools. I would definitely recommend this disc.",1394064000,,2254,4.737244897959184

4587227,4,B00567TCD8,"I used this product to ""calibrate"" my eight-month old Samsung UN55F7100 television.  I was very pleased with the picture quality before I started, and I did make a few changes as suggested by the provided instruction.  The changes didn't truly result in a more satisfying picture than I previously had, but I don't regret the purchase anyway.  I plan to use it on other televisions that I know display a poor picture, and I fully expect more noticeable results on those units.  The blue filter included in this set does not work as well as just using my televisions RGB filter, but not all TV's have this feature.  I'm still going through Disc 2 just to see what's on it of value.  I think this set is likely more useful for those who are very new to the HDTV experience because of the content's simplicity.  Going through Disc 1 can easily burn up several hours, but can be completed in less than one hour by skipping some of the explanation material for each picture attribute.  I was somewhat disappointed that the calibration disc touches upon fewer than half of the modifiable picture controls that my television has available, and I'm left to wonder how much better my picture might be had test patterns been available for all those controls.",1393804800,,1248,4.666666666666667

That said, I just did the basic optimization- will do the more thorough optimization later and may see more results then.  Anyway, overall I recommend this product!",1393718400,,454,4.580246913580247

I was never unhappy with the picture but always figured there was more that I could do, I just didn't know where to start.  This package was just what I needed.

There are a few home theater tweaking DVDs out there but most cost twice as much and, from my understanding, don't offer anything more.  This package included 2 BluRays, the first is the meat and potatoes with all manner of patterns and instructions on how to use them.  There is also a color filter included that is used specifically in color adjustment. The second disc is to admire the work you have done and includes a wide selection of nature and Disney clips.

There is a quick setup that covers the basics and, including the instructions for each section, takes about 10 minutes to get through.  My guess is that no one that buys this package uses the quick setup.  The expert setup takes closer to 30 minutes including instructions and about 10 minutes if you've used the disc before, if you're setting up a second TV for example.

I learned much more than I thought I would from the setup instructions.  The disc kept indicating that my TV was set to automatically scale images and, as a result, was not providing an accurate image from BluRays.  It took me a while to dig through the menus but I finally found out how to turn it off.  The dozens of small adjustments, like that, made a pretty noticeable difference.  Even my wife, who does not typically care about that kind of stuff, mentioned the picture looked better.
There is also a small section for testing a surround sound setup but it is not nearly as robust.

This disc is easy to use, especially for the type of person that would purchase this kind of thing in the first place.  For the cost I would recommend it to anyone who has purchased a nice TV and wants to get the most out of it.",1393632000,,1965,4.401662049861496

There were extensive calibration options. You can choose between different levels of calibration, and the expert option is fairly complex and complicated. I think there are enough choices and options that most anyone could find something useful from this, whether you are looking for some basic tweaks or extensive calibration.

One of the thing that made it easy to use is the explanation on what the test does, how to use it and you can go do the test once you understand what you're doing.

My only complaint is that the audio signal tests are in order frequency order and then channel (speaker) order so you can't directly jump from 20 - 20k left channel and jump to the center, you have to page back through all of the other sound frequencies before you can hear that same frequency sample on a different speaker.",1387065600,8,720,4.333333333333333

First you adjust your brightness based on a very basic pattern. Easy enough. Then contrast is next. Then you progressively go through more complicated patterns that all have you adjusting the same thing, your basic brightness and contrast. Basically you could just have included that one single final pattern and saved everyone a lot of time. You're not ""fine tuning"" anything, it's just more refined patterns as time goes on.

Then to adjust color they basically have a few pictures of random things and people and say ""adjust color till it looks good."" Well duh! Why do I need your expensive disc to do that when I can do that with any dvd or blu ray anytime??

There is ZERO way to help someone adjust white balance. Zero way to adjust things like W/B detail adjustment, color detail adjustment, 10 point color, gamma detail adjustment. Instead they focus on things like making sure your tv scales properly. If you're buying a tv in 2013 and using a blu ray player, it's 99.9 percent guaranteed that it's going to properly scale things.

Again, this is extremely basic stuff. There is nothing innately wrong with it, however it's a joke to say this is anything high end or something a professional would use to calibrate. You can do 90 percent of what this disc does with a free pattern found off google.

At the first run, a message pops up (or, at least, does so if system is connected to the internet) offering to Download the UPDATED WOW MATERIAL - but only if you have a system with built-in storage of some sort.

Alas, our system does not include such storage, so we have no idea what the ""Updated"" material is.

Amazon customer service, as usual, was great - note the reference above to receiving TWO ""WOW"" disks: we are not out any $$.

Amazon ALSO put THEIR sales of the WOW disk on hold for a while - and have now changed the description to remove the ""2012"" tag. They have really responded well to the circumstances.

But, OTOH, we still do not have a copy of the 2012 version.

As others have commented, this disc has good narration that explains how to calibrate the TV, along with some background on why certain settings are important. In the actual calibration screens, Goofy does NOT do the talking. Rather a calm, but professional female voice. Goofy only talks at the very beginning of the disc where he discusses such very basic things like ""what is HD"" or ""What is Widescreen"" and things like that. Occasionally there are advertising plugs for various Disney movies, but it is not intrusive, especially in the actual calibration screens. For testing actual sample movie scenes, of course, they use Disney, but that is expected I suppose. I am not a professional TV calibrator, just someone interested in seeing how good my TV is. The price of the basic version of this disc was plenty good enough for me.

4587324,5,B00567TCD8,"Hello

I consider myself as a ""Video Enthusiast""...one who likes and loves excellent image, video and details in movies. It's something that I always stride for and don't skip on. I've had Sony XBR tube sets, Sony LCD's and our current HT Room set...Panasonic GT30 Plasma. In every instance I've always sought out recommended settings via a site...AVSForum.com...where one can pretty much find excellent advice on anything audio & video. In the video area you'll find TV settings posted by professional calibrators which has never failed me yet. But you take them with a grain of salt as to conditions are not the same nor the source via cable or SAT.

Though I was happy I wanted to verify and see if there could be any additional fine tuning. The Disney WOW disc was praised by about everyone on the forums and worthwhile. So I ordered it not knowing what to expect.

The disc actually surprised me in many ways providing everything from beginner to advance. With each step there is a decent tutorial though some you may need to revisit which it hints at. There is plenty in covering about all the major areas of fine tuning your picture except any ""pro-settings"" that might be accessible on various sets. It will cover the contrast, color, brightness and sharpness settings in various ways in quite of bit of detail with a good set of tools (image presentations)at your disposal.

After doing all the work and ready to test the results you can run clips of various Disney movies most of which are some of the very best animation out there. Or just run it in ""Loop Mode"" which is a good way to break in a newer set. One feature I like especially for Panasonic owners is the ""Pixel Orbiter""; basically a colored static snow screen to help any burn-in issues. While Panasonic TV's have a sliding bar it turns off at a set time (10 min). The Pixel Orbiter can go on for as long as you want.

One other item the disc has is for Audio Setup but I haven't used that. We have a Yamaha AVR-671 that has the Auto-Setup w/ Microphone. So I cannot comment on what it does or how well. I'll hang on to the diisc since Plasma Panels do age and over a course of time I'll probably have to adjust the Contrast, Brightness and Sharpness the most. I didn't have to adjust to much from the settings I was using but in the areas like sharpness I did and made a difference. Overall the picture is outstanding. Could I have gone without it...yea, maybe but if one is spending a great deal on a set it's a no brainier to spend basically ""nickles & dimes"" on thi disc to help you really enjoy it.

I ended up choosing this 2 disc set because I wanted to see the compilation of HD scenes from the ""Visions"" disc. I wouldn't say they blew me away, but they were very pleasant to look at and wouldn't be back to let run in loop just to show of some HD backdrops.

Navigating the disc is actually a pleasant experience. It's the easiest blue-ray disc I've ever navigated the menu of. I wish more Blue-Ray discs would be produced at this level of quality.

The calibration disc is amazing! It has multi-level breakdowns of technology used in HD TV sets (how it relates to the customer) for those that are less familiar with it. I haven't been able to work through all of the calibration tools for setting up my TV because I've been more focused on the the ""Pixel Flipper"". I have not been a very good owner to my new 3k Plasma and I allowed some static imaged to ""burn-in"" (Image Retention is more apropriate) and I have not been able to remove it through constant movie playing, and the built-in screen wipe feature. Enter the ""Pixel Flipper"". It has not removed the image rention on my plasma fully but watching it turn each pixel on and off 29 times a second is pretty cool and looks a lot like static ""snow"" from bad channels (though this specifically targets EVERY pixel). I have been amazed at how well it has been ""softening"" the retained images and I'm confident that they will be removed in time.

I'd say 65% of the disc is geared toward advanced users, so if you consider yourself advanced, then I think this disc will be more helpful to you.

Having said that, I did use both the beginner and some advanced features on this disc to fine tune my TV. The final settings are fairly close to the various factory-set picture modes with some minor, but noticeable improvements. So, overall I'm happy with the final outcome. Just wish they had ""dumbed down"" it a little bit, perhaps having another section for intermediate users.

I think to those that do, this product would be a disappointment and would be better off looking to something like the ""Spears & Munsil HD Benchmark"". But for most people, including mid-level enthusiasts like myself, this is a good purchase. There are two levels of testing (Basic and Advanced) which allows you to choose how far you want to dabble in calibrating your display/sound. I tried them both-the advanced is far more accurate, relying on test patters to help you make adjustments whereas the ""Basic"" tests are often ""by eye"". For example, in the basic level they give you three reference images to help you adjust color/hue/saturation. But in the end, its what looks right TO YOU, which in my opinion you could do the same thing watching a movie or TV show that you're familiar with and adjust your TV to ""look right"". In advanced mode however, you use a blue filter to view test patterns and adjust the color/tint until they're even and accurate (who knew test patterns were actually good for something?!). The only reason I didn't give this product a 5 star rating is that its a DVD, not a Blu-ray, so I found the images and patterns that you're supposed to use to dial in sharpness/resolution to be useless.

Good - This product does help calibrate a TV.  Yes, I'm smart enough to do most of it on my own to get it looking like I want, but this has some serious screen tools to help get that final touch.  Honestly, it's that last bit of tuning on a TV that makes it go from being 'normal' to looking excellent.  I think the included glasses to get the tint and color excatly right were very helpful too - some didn't think so but every thing has to be set well for me to like a screen.

Not-so-good - There isn't anything truly bad about this.  I just wished it were easier to navigate on the advanced tuning options. When you change the contrast and brightness and color you have to go back to do the final adjustments.  This became frustrating to me as I do it a few times on each. The scenes they offer to see the differences are cool, but to me could have been better.

Conclusion - It's a good product. It should be a few dollars cheaper.  It is well thought out overall and helps make your TV sparkle.

What to expect:
I immediately wanted to pop the disc in and check it out. My immediate concern is regarding the Image Retention i see on my plasma from running the Disney channel in standard def. I told my wife about using the HD disney channel to fill the screen but i guess i don't know what im talking about. Anyway, there is a tool on this disc called ""PIXEL FLIPPER"" which adresses this type of concern. This is basically a colored snow pattern flipping every pixel on your screen 29 times per second. To use the ""PIXEL FLIPPER"" tool they recommend running it for an hour mininum and over night if needed. Well, my Sony BluRay player has a feature which turns itself off if it detects no activity for about 15 or 20 minutes. (In fact they all do) You cannot turn this off on my unit.  Well, due to the way Disney implemented this tool, i am unable to use it because the BluRay player perceives this screen to be ""paused"" and after 15 minutes it does it's job and shuts down. I cannot use this tool for more than 15 or 20 minutes!!! This was the main reason i bought the disc.
I already used the AVS Forums HD 709 calibration disc for free. I am thinking about getting the DVD version and playing it through my Xbox which doesnt have this non-sense. Not sure who to blame - sony for not allowing you to toggle this feature, o Disney for not thinking it through. tough call.

As far as the disc is concerned, the menus are very attractive and easy to navigate around and are eye appealing. It really is stunning so far, makes you want to play with the different areas and explore. I found the more advanced tools and though i have only had this disc for one day, i am happy so far that it will be useful to do a fairly decent calibration and i am looking forward to using the Surround Sound tools to tune up my audio system too.

I simply had to dock it one star because ALL HOME THEATRE equipment has screen savers and power management turned on by DEFAUlT. You HAVE TO INTENTIONALLY turn this stuff off to run this tool for one hour much less over night (my Sony bluray player thinks its paused and static). Not good!! Everything would be okay if the player only detected some activity from the tool. If anyone knows a work around  i would love to hear from you. Good Luck!

4587361,3,B00567TCD8,"I calibrated two 1080P LED LCD 70 inch tvs by eye and then by the BD WOW.  Not surprisingly, the numbers were VERY close.  So, depending upon what I'm watching, I have the settings somewhere between my ""eye"" numbers and the disc numbers.

I calibrated a 1080P DLP projector shooting a 12 foot image and a 50 inch 720P plasma by eye and then using the BD WOW.  Surprisingly, I could never achieve as good of results with the WOW disc as I could by eye.  Therefore, I used my ""eye"" settings and not the WOW settings.

Conclusion:  This BD WOW Calibration disc will help you calibrate an LED LCD.  Those with little experience calibrating will benefit the most.  However, from my experience, it offered no calibration help with a DLP Projector or Plasma tv - NONE.

As for the layout of the disc itself:  It was somewhat frustrating.  I think they could have done a better job in the layout of the menus.  There is an awful lot of time wasted going from menu item to menu item and with lots of repetitive material and information that pertains to things that you cannot change anyhow.  Basically, this is a calibration tool for CONTRAST and BRIGHTNESS as well as a great introduction to how HD works for those that don't know.

And, they could have given better HD reference material to ""experience"" your post-calibration images.  Instead, they give you tons of Disney animation to view.  I would have rather had more skin tones.

Folks that don't spend alot of time tweaking their sets will benefit most from this calibration disc as it will get you to the ballpark.  For those that tweak and tweak and tweak constantly, chances are you won't benefit much at all from this disc.  If it had more/better reference material I'd be much happier.  This ""SHOULD"" be the BD you grab to show friends how amazing your set up is.  Unfortunately, unless you want to show them the already amazing images of animation, it is not.  Impressive skin tones, city streets, nature scenes, etc... would be so much better.  But it is obvious that the included ref material is just a Disney commercial.  There's a Pirates clip that takes place in the dark.  Okay, nice to check for your blacks, but a beach scene with skin tones, sand, sky and ocean would have been soooo much better.

So, if you just can't seem to get a good picture from your LCD, buy it.  If you have an awesome picture from your LCD or you own a plasma or DLP, you can pass on it.",1373155200,2,2427,4.47945205479452

I didn't have any issues, but if I did, I'm not sure what I would have been able to do with them... get an expensive TV maintenance I guess...

All of your basic settings will be easy to adjust. Your colors and contrasts will look natural (not overblown or underwhelming) and your TV will burst to life. There are three levels- Basic, Advanced and Expert. Each and every adjustment available has an explanation as to what the setting does, how to do the test, and then the test itself. Basic is for those that don't understand enough to be dangerous but still want a good picture (Mom, you would understand how to do this with this level, I promise). Advanced is for people like me that like to get a little more into it and that understand more than just the basics (many people even interested in a product like this are probably in this category). Expert is for those that literally have the (expensive) tools of the trade and need a simple/fast Blu Ray to use as reference (99% of you reading this review will most likely not be in this category... like me).

All in all, a good purchase. I suggest getting the one-disc (read: cheaper) version as most people claim the 2nd disc is kinda lame anyway and they have enough Disney and Disney Pixar clips on the one-disc to test how it all looks after adjusting.

When comparing the two versions, I found there was a slight difference regarding the contrast quality, which might be expected because of the higher resolution achieved from using Bluray on a 1080p TV. Now that I compared the two, I'd say you could use either to produce great results, and adjust the contrast to your personal liking (the contrast will make edge/detail sharper or softer depending on what you choose). I found 20 to 23 was a good contrast setting on my 50"" LG PN6500 1080p plasma, and also on a 42"" Samsung 1080p plasma.

Tips: Read the manual first, then follow the tutorial when playing the disk. I found the learning curve to be about an hour to master it at the Advanced level. Go with Basic first, then when you have that down well enough, you can then run through the Advanced menu. I did just that and found I squeezed out a slight improvement; the Advanced allows for finer adjustments. When I did my second TV I was able to go through the whole process in about 15 minutes, including Advanced.

Your whites will be as bright as possible but you'll still see shades of white just below peak. Finally - you can adjust your sharpness setting for full detail but without any edge enhancement (a white outline around objects to create the false impression of sharpness).

All four of these discs do that but the WOW disc is easier to use and easier to get the best results by eye.

If I were playing around with a test instrument such as a colorimeter (Spyder, etc) and planning on delving into the hidden service menus of my HDTV, I'd purchase the Spears & Munsil II disc. Otherwise the WOW is superior and has the easiest to use test patterns for the key parameters that you can set by eye. In fact, the WOW disc actually has the better patterns with finer granularity than the other discs.

An unfortunate title for a superior disc.

Update (August 2013): Spears and Munsil has just released their second editon test disc which is superb yet the Disney WoW still remains my favorite for setting up the basics",1366416000,18,2025,4.636871508379889

THX has a calibration Bluray, but they don't sell it (you must complete the THX certification program to get it...LOL...)....And I am not talking about the generic tool they put on some Sony Bluray movies...I wanted a REAL Calibration Bluray...

5 out of 5 stars....Very awesome and well put together Bluray....

It has basic setup for non techy people, but for those of us who know how to use a SPL and Spectrum Analyzer its very possible to get your surround sound system you spent $1000's on to sound as perfect as it can.

For those of you who have spent hours, days, weeks playing with Audyssey and Harmon's EasyEQ and just cant find that perfect sound you are looking for....Stop wasting your time...Buy this Bluray, learn how to use an SPL and Spectrum Analyzer (hardware or software will work with a good microphone)....Spend 2-3 hours and go through it all....When you are done....It will be amazing to your ears....

I have a Denon 3313ci with JBL L-Series Studio 890, LC2, and JBL Surrounds with a JBL Subwoofer...

Crossover set for:
890s - Full Range
Center Channel LC2 - 60Hz
Surrounds - 80Hz
Subwoofer LFE cut at 120Hz

All speakers and Sub levels balanced at 90db +/- 1db using SPL Meter...C-Weight

Used measuring tape to determine actual speaker distance from sweet spot....Audyssey wasn't too inaccurate...

All Denon sound processing disabled during calibrations. Left most of it off afterwards....

Used Denon MultiEQ manual mode for frequency adjustments. Needed lots of room correction...My room is very responsive to 125Hz, 1Khz, and 4Khz....turned those WAY DOWN...achieved leveled bands with low and high curve on spectrum...

As for video calibration....Turned out I didn't need any....All tests showed no need for calibration....But I have a new Panasonic LED TV....I always disable that soapy (AKA: Motion Smoothing) feature that Best Buy and other retailer demo the TVs with...HATE IT...Disable that automatic brightness crap, etc...

I was pretty happy with the picture on the TV, but after reading several reviews I became convinced that it could be made better with the WOW calibration disk. Well.....there is a fine line between better and just different.
It is really just a matter of perspective. I am sure there are some who will be WOW'ed (pun intended) but after several
attempts over a period of about a week, I determined that at least for me, this disk was probably a waste of money.
It is difficult to adjust color on a video monitor (that's what a TV is after all) if you do not have a reference point.
You can make all the adjustments you like and if you do not know what it is supposed to look like when you are finished, you will not know if you have accomplished anything. This disk does not provide you with a reference.
A picture on a TV will always be subjective to the viewer. What is good to one may not be to another.
Also to be considered is that when watching a TV show, or movie, you may have good color and a great picture on one movie but not another.
My advice is that if you are happy with the TV as is, save your money.",1359590400,4,1196,4.115384615384615

I never even knew calibration was possible or ever even heard of it, I just played with settings in the Blu Ray player, the TV and the receiver settings trying to adjust things but I had little knowledge of many settings.
I plugged in this Disney WOW disc and learned many things about home theater. It took several hours to go through all the most important tests and adjustments. I found out that I needed the remotes for the TV, Blu Ray player and receiver. And a comfortable chair right in front of the TV.
This is a very enjoyable disc to plug in and explore your system and settings. Set aside a few hours away from any distractions, grab a cup of coffee and prepare to discover your systems properties and potential. You will be clearly instructed on how to tighten up your audio and video and test your settings so that you will be satisfied that everything is where it needs to be for your system to run at it's optimum levels.
This is an invaluable disc, as time goes by and you acquire newer hardware you can run these tests and find out what you've really got and adjust settings properly.
I have a 3 year old Samsung plasma TV and I found out it's in very good shape. My audio is all Sony speakers and a JBL subwoofer running from a Yamaha reveiver set to 100 watts per channel and it is pumping some powerful sound.

It's nice to add to the Disney collection (+1 star), but just be aware this is nowhere close to a professional ISF calibration. Remember, you get what you pay for when it comes to TV calibration - if you want $20 worth, go ahead. Strongly recommend a professional if you can find a friend or someone who can do it for cheap. Best Buy actually does it pretty competitively for about $250 which isn't bad. Can't do it yourself though as the equipment alone can cost thousands. This doesn't even include the certification and having the ""eye"" for it. And for those that don't know what a professional calibration is, it is NOT nancying around with the brightness/tint controls. It is someone going into the ROOT menu of the tv (which if you did yourself, you would void your warranty and risk permanently damaging your tv beyond repair) using a specialized equipment set, computer, spectrometer and special multi-hundred/thousand dollar software. All of the color value %'s are completely changed to match your environment permanently. And it can make a dramatic difference especially for opening up every color on the spectrum (BLACKS!) within your tv's capability. For that reason, not all tv's calibrate we'll.

I thought it would be perfect for me, because I just recently purchased a new HDTV.

So, I finally get my hands on the Blu-Ray and pop it in to get started.

I watch as the narrator tells me how to adjust everything with the help of stars and lines.

I then go on to the actual calibration portion of the Blu-Ray only to discover that said ""stars and lines"" are actually missing.

Yes, that's right, missing, as in not there at all. Mind you, the stars that go bright and shake for a second appear, but once they are gone, the disc is useless.

I thought that maybe it's something I'm not seeing, but after searching high and low for an answer, I've come to the final conclusion that I got a bum copy.

I'm very unhappy.",1357516800,4,844,4.204968944099379
4587489,5,B00567TCD8,"Even though this isn't meant for tuning computer displays, I bought the product because I wanted to tune up an old computer display that seemed to be getting dull, rather than buying a new one.  I had tried using some free online tools, but they could only get me so far.  I figured that a tune-up, if successful, would be cheaper than a new monitor.

To practice using it, I went through the disc on my usual home TV, which was ""fine"" beforehand.  I was quite surprised to see that, after some fairly minimal adjustments, the screen seemed brighter, sharper, and ""like new"" again.  The changes I made were small changes in brightness and contrast and very minor color adjustments, but I think the major part of the improvement came from correcting overscan.  Whatever the reason, I got my money's worth before I even used it for the reason I bought it.
Then I went to another, older TV in the house to see if another miracle was possible.  This TV was an older LED TV, which had been moved with the household twice.  Again, it was ""OK"" before I started, but I had been thinking about replacing it with a new, brighter model.  Because it had been set up professionally twice before for different homes (and lighting conditions, etc.), I found this TV to be impossible to adjust with the Disney disc.  Out of desperation, I did a ""reset to defaults"" on all the adjustments and tried again.  I was pleased to find that I could now use the tools on the Disney disc to make the display look far better than it had before.  Unfortunately, I found that the ""overscan"" was way off on this set, but it was not adjustable (like it was on TV #1).  Therefore, this set may still be destined for replacement, but I'm still getting a lot of enjoyment out of it.
That was 2 big wins, again, making the cost of the disc easily justifiable.

I finally tried it on my computer display.  Again, after a ""reset to defaults"" and going through the adjustments, there was a small improvement in the monitor's output.  I guess there's a reason why this product doesn't mention adjusting computer monitors - the TVs I adjusted benefited far more, and the free online tools I had found previously had allowed me to get about the same results.

SUMMARY:  Well worth the money if you have an older TV that you're considering replacing, or you want to make sure your TV monitor is giving you the best output you can get.
PROs: VERY easy to use.  VERY clear background and instructions for each test so you know what you're looking for and why.  Included color filter makes color adjustment easy and takes out all the guesswork and personal preference.
CONs:  Menus can be a bit of a challenge to navigate through if you need to go back and forth between tests quickly.  Audio section is rudimentary if you don't have a sound meter, which most people don't.
TIPS: Consider resetting the monitor to its original defaults if you are having trouble improving the output.  Adjust overscan if possible.  Use it on every TV you have - you might be surprised.",1357516800,,3023,4.535055350553505

It lets you manage the brightness, contrast, tint, color, sharpness, screen size, gamma, gray-scale, but what doesn't have is a setup for warms or cold colors, either to set white balances.

The futures that the blu ray brings are nice, stunning images of flowers so you can see if you made right the color and tint calibration. After calibration, I compare the new settings with two of the defaults modes, on named Natural and the other Dynamic. In the calibrated mode I can see flowers details, specially for the red ones. But in the natural and dynamic mode the red flowers become really blur like paints stains -so, yes, calibrations works-.

I'm still changing settings but at the same time, after I made changes, I recheck and re calibrate with the tools of this Blu-Ray.

I read about the Disney WOW BD, and decided to give it a shot, and I'm glad I did.

4587531,5,B00567TCD8,"If you are like me, you appreciate the experience of a nice home-theater system, but you may not have all of the A/V know-how to make the most out of your setup.  There are a LOT of different settings to tinker with, and frankly, it can be frustrating, confusing, and time-consuming to get everything ""just right"".  When you tinker with one setting, it affects others, and some of the advanced settings on a good plasma or LCD TV almost seem like a foreign language to those of us who wern't in the A/V club in high school!

This product changes the learning curve.  No longer will one feel the need to call in some ""expert"" to set up their home theater.  The set-up of this disc is such where those people who don't know beans about any aspect of home theater systems have some great intro material to watch and learn from, while others that have more experience or knowledge can easily skip those sections.  Then, it progresses in to the actual tests and tools that you will be using to calibrate your system.  These are also divided in to sections ranging from basic to advanced-level tools.

Each test/tool is then further split in to three parts, which are also individually selected on the menu so you again have the ability to skip anything that you don't think you need.  The first part explains the purpose of the settings, and how it affects the picture or sound.  The explanations are straight-forward, simple without having the feeling that you are being treated like an idiot, and quite informative.  The next part is the instructions of how to perform the test/use the tool, including explaining exactly what setting you shoud be adjusting on your TV or speaker system.  The third part is the test/tool itself.

To make things just a tad easier to start with, instead of starting from scratch, I went to CNET and looked up the recommended settings for my television.  Since all TVs are a bit different, and settings will differ depending on ambient room lighting, age of the TV, etc, these will almost certainly not be the perfect settings for everyone.  I then went ahead and used the tools on this Blu-ray to fine-tune my system.  The results were truly astounding!  The difference in picture and sound quality was vastly superior to what the factory pre-sets were, let alone my feeble attempts at adjusting the settings myself without a guide!

So, here's the bottom line: you just spent a huge chunk of change on a nice television and sound system.  You want the best performance possible from your new ""toys"".  You can either drop another $100.00 + USD to have an ""expert"" come in and get everything set up for you, or, you can spend $20.00 USD for a tool that will allow you to do it yourself, and be able to use it for any other TV in your home.  If somehow your system decides to do something funky in the future, and it resets itself to factory defaults, (hey, all electronics are buggy... no matter the brand or the price tag!), the you have this awesome tool to get everything back to optimum performance.  You want to change the furniture around, and need to move the speakers?  No problem!  Pop this disc in the Blu-ray player, and get the settings perfect for your new configuration!

Did I mention it also has an excellent tool to fix image burn-in and ""pixel fatigue""?  This is an important part of the maintenance of newer televisions, and the tool provided on this disc is far superior to the ""anti-image retention"" tools pre-installed on most televisions.

Anyone who owns a new plasma or LCD television are truly missing out if they do not utilize this amazing product!  There are similar ones on the market, but this is by far the best one available and accessable for the vast majority of people.  And for $20.00 USD, after dropping a few grand on my system, it's a no-brainer purchase in my book.",1347926400,12,3833,4.603829160530191

If you want to buy it to optimize your TV, I wouldn't recommend it; but if you want the bonus DVD as another Disney oceanographic movie, then it's a go.",1345766400,4,662,4.261904761904762
4587537,3,B00567TCD8,"This did a good job helping me to get the best Contrast, Brightness, & Sharpness settings on a Sharp Aquos Quattron 60"" LED/LCD TV (LC-60LE832U).

There wasn't anything on this Blu-Ray about optimizing the LED Backlighting. Most LED Edge-Lit models have an inherrent problem of ""Blooming"" since the backlighting is reflected from the sides. On the plus side, Edge-Lit models can be thinner, lighter, & use less energy. However, if you're not use to watching this type it can be annoying. During normal to brightly lit scenes the pictures look great. However, during more darkly lit scenes you will notice Blooming and it becomes worse the higher the LED Backlight is set. Blooming appears in darker scenese around the edges of the darkest objects on the screen. It appears as a halo of dark blues, purples, and shades of gray/black. It actually comes from light bleeding in from the surrounding lighter objects. You can play with the LED Backlighting until you find a happy medium.

The other disappointing thing about this was the diagnostics for setting the Color & Tint. They provide a blue filter which you are supposed to look through at a test pattern on the screen. You have to adjust the Color until the White & Blue columns on either side appear to be the same color of blue, and the opposite color at the bottom of these columns becomes indistinguishable from the top. I went throught the advanced instructions/diagnostics for this several times and came up with the same horrible results each time. There is a similar process using other columns for the Tint. On my TV the Blue & White columns didn't look the same shade of blue until I turned the Color all the way up to +30. The Tint setting turned out to be +15. When I tested this setting by watching FIOS, it looked horrible, the color was way over saturated, and the flesh tones were way off. It's best just to find a Picture setting you like and then change the Color & Tint until they look normal (Of course this is subjective to the viewer). On my TV it looked good with the Color set to 0 and the Tint set to +5. Or you can pay a Pro $300 to come out to your house and do it for you, but I'd rather play with it myself.",1345766400,4,2190,4.5

After buying it I went online to see how to get the best picture out of it. The reviews said that the black levels for the one I have are not that good, but the picture is awsome. I looked up how to calibrate it for my tv and read about these nice DVD's you can buy to help with that. After some research I decided to get the Blu-Ray Disney WOW because it had so much better reviews than any of the other calibration DVD's out there. I can say that it did not let me down. This product has everything you need to get the best picture out of your HD tv aside from hireing a pro to come to your house and setting it up for you. The menu's are really easy to use and explain everything in great detail how the tools work and how to use them. Every time you choose something to set, be it brightness or contrast or any of the other options on your tv you can get an explaination on how the tools work and how to use them to set it for best picture. Befor you start calibration I recomend to watch all the explinations to better understand how a HD tv works. The Disney WOW has really easy to understand information. After I used it to calibrate my tv I can say that the picture is way better than it was when I tried to do it myself. I was just useing the tv presets and I could get a nice picture. But after the fine tune on it with the Disney WOW I REALLY get a great picture that pops with awsome colors and I can see really great detail with great blacks. I have tested this now on a number of movies like, How to train your dragon and Tron. I just got done watching Couples Retreat and Legend of the Guardians. You can see so much detail in the owls feathers its just amazing. If you don't have the money to spend on a pro than this is your best choice to set up your HD tv. Plus there is a set up for beginners and then you can choose to use the more advance set up choices to really get your HD tv to proper calibration with more advance tools.

4587553,5,B00567TCD8,"I know a lot of people don't set up their HDTVs properly. The thing is, it's easier than ever thanks to calibration discs. Disney is a surprising entry in this field but a welcome one.

Disney's disc is surprisingly good. It has a bunch of industry-standard calibration tests for white levels, black levels, aspect ratio (see if you have that pesky overscan turned on), sharpness and contrast, and so forth. Helpfully, it also includes short narrated videos on how to conduct the test and how it should look once it's done. Even more helpfully, all the narration is also included in a printed booklet, so you don't even need to watch the videos. The basic tests would probably suffice for about 90% of people, but there is also a full suite of advanced tests for people who want to get the picture as nice as humanly possible.

The rest of the disc is dedicated to clips of various Disney movies. Toy Story, Wall-E, Up, Bolt, and so forth. The pictures look great and really show it off.

The second disc, ""Visions"", is mainly a relaxing sequence of nature shots with comforting music. I've been using it to break in my plasma a bit, but it would be good, for, say, running in a loop during a party.

In short - this seems good for novices, good for HT buffs, and good as a showcase piece for your new TV. If you're not going to spend hundreds of dollars on a professional calibration, why not spend $25 on a do-it-yourself disc?",1335571200,,1429,4.484615384615385

4587561,5,B00567TCD8,"I recently purchased a new HDTV and was having a lot of trouble getting it calibrated correctly.  None of the presets were even close to what I would consider to be the ideal settings, so I decided to try out a few of the calibration discs available including Disney WOW, Digital Video Essentials, and Spears & Munsil.  As one would expect from Disney, I found their WOW disc to be the most straight forward and easiest to use by far.  Although it comes with a step by step user manual, I found that I didn't even need to open it.

I am pretty technical, so I have to admit that I was initially concerned that the Disney disc might be geared too much for the beginner and wouldn't be as useful as some of the other discs.  However, I am happy to say that I needn't have been concerned.  The disc provides three different modes of operation Beginner, Advanced, and Expert; so it is ideally suited to anyone from the least technical to the most technical.

One of the things that really impressed me about Disney WOW was its test patterns particularly the ones for brightness and contrast.  I absolutely love them!  In my opinion, they are much easier to use than the patterns that come with the other brands.  Each test pattern comes with a clear and concise audio/visual introduction and demonstration which makes it very easy to understand exactly what the pattern is intended to reveal and how to adjust the corresponding TV settings.

The bottom line is that Disney WOW provides exactly what you need in a calibration disc.  It contains appropriate explanations and guidance without overwhelming the user with a lot of technobabble.  The other two brands that I tried were nowhere near as easy to use as Disney WOW and both of them just seemed too technical for the average home user.  If you're looking for the perfect home theater calibration disc, then look no further than Disney WOW.  I highly recommend it!",1330819200,3,1915,4.624260355029586

4587565,5,B00567TCD8,"Wow (no pun intended :) )! This product is great. So great in fact that I actually felt compelled to write a review, which might be a first for me.  I love this for three reasons:

1) I would consider myself pretty tech heavy but not an expert when it comes to advanced TV calibration. I wanted something that I could geek out on, but with enough guidance that I knew what I was doing. This fit that description like a charm! There are multiple levels of configurations (i.e. ""Basic,"" ""Advanced,"" ""Evaluation,"" etc...), and before every calibration you can check out information on what it is you're doing, and also a quick description of what you should be looking for during your changes.

2) The end result! I won't go into gory details as there are so many other positive reviews to this point, but I will say it does the trick. I have checked out a couple A/V sites in the past and used their recommendations, which I never stayed happy with for long, and always reverted to a pre-configured factory setting. Not this time! I used it for a 6 year old DLP TV, and plan on using it on a new LED-LCD being delivered in less than a week. And will of course recommend it to anyone I know looking to customize their HDTV for the best picture.

3) Lastly, but most assuredly not least, the ""Pixel Flipper."" Ahhhh the pixel flipper... Now this type of thing may exist in many other places, but I had no idea. Basically, referring to using this on my old DLP TV, I had a small grouping of ""stuck"" pixels in the upper-left hand corner, which constantly shown light. In summary, a circle of white right where the 16:9 black bars usually are located. This was maddening! I lived with this for about a year and a half. I got this DVD ran through a couple configurations, decided I'd see what the pixel flipper meant, and it alone was enough to warrant the purchase. It ""flips"" every single pixel on your TV between different colors and black and white. In about 4.5 seconds 90% of the bad pixels had cleared up. There is still a small dot of white in that area, but now unnoticeable from my viewing distance. And the DVD does say that not all pixel issues can be fixed.

All in all, I love this calibration tool. I was worried that it was going to be more cartoon than tool, but was quickly at ease. There really isn't any of that in the configurations (just mainly in the DVD intro). I will recommend it to anyone I know looking for something like this. Disney is definitely a quality brand, but I have to admit that I wasn't expecting what I got. And for that, this review. Thanks, Disney!",1329609600,3,2583,4.372916666666667

Since I already made some adjustments on my own, it wasn't that helpful.

Everyone else talked about how good it was for a better TV. I didn't read anything about TV's that didn't have all the calibration options. I thought, ""I've had this TV for three years and I totally should have bought this three years ago."" I know they didn't make this three years ago so whatever. I've read all kinds of stuff but mostly stick to the out-of-box settings for my TV like Movie mode. I didn't realize how much difference adjusting only my brightness and contrast would make. I can't adjust individual Red Green Blue but I can still do overall color and even that made a big difference. A couple other things in Basic got my TV looking way better.

It teaches you everything you need to know and presents it in a way that isn't complicated at all for beginners. I already knew a little about home theater set ups and found this video very educational. I watched through the entire video even the parts that I already knew. It really helps squeeze out every ounce of picture quality out of your TV.

4587599,4,B00567TCD8,"Let me start off by saying the Blu-Ray does a fantastic job doing what its supposed to do. In that, the settings that it attempts to perfect, do look perfect. It's an easy to use interface with no real knowledge of TV settings necessary. If you can use a Blu-Ray player and navigate through the menu screen on your TV then you shouldn't have an issue with usability. It effects a bunch of the major settings on your TV and I suppose could conceivably make a huge difference on a very poorly calibrated TV.

That being said I bought this Blu-Ray because I bought a new TV and wanted to get the most out of it. However, in the end very little needed to be changed that wasn't overly obvious from the start. I didn't realize the slight difference that a product like this would have on my TV. I'm posting this review mainly to say that while the Blu-Ray does a good job of calibrating your TV, such calibration may not be necessary and that 25 bucks might be better spent getting some popcorn and an entertainment Blu-Ray.",1313366400,,1019,4.391534391534392

I, too, have a Samsung LED set; one major complaint of the Samsungs is that the factory settings give everything a ""soap opera"" look, also described as ""handycam""; even _Lord of the Rings_ looked like it was shot on digital tape. All I want to add to JC's splendid review is that you don't even have to look at the manual, if you don't want to; you can simply drop in the disc and follow the simple, clear onscreen instructions. In half an hour, using the basic instructions, I had a great picture; the advanced instructions offered a couple more tweaks, but they were essentially insignificant, not really noticeable minor adjustments.

Then I moved on to the aspect ratio setup and it was there I discovered that it isn't possible to adjust the aspect ratio with the current setup- it is fixed with that setup (about 1/4"" over-scale) and can't be modified.

Myself I have a projector and made slight adjustments with the disc to color, sharpness etc that made it more explosive to watch then before.  I really liked the audio portion for speaker setup as they use a voice instead of that test tone which helped me find a problem with how I had hooked up my 7.1 speakers.  The only part I found lacking was that unless you buy a meter to measure sound you pretty much have to adjust your speakers to your preference instead of being able to balance them professionally.  Other than that it was well worth the money.  Tonight I will be trying it on my regular HDTV.

I did a few tweaks and I am very happy. The colors pop now and the picture looks better overall.

Recommend this disc to anyone looking to get better picture out of their HDTV. Even if you got setting like me from the net.

However the 2nd disc isn't great at all... Save money if you can and get the 1 disc unit.

Only thing I wish they had included would be a green and red filter. So that you could get even better colors.",1306281600,10,705,4.154411764705882
4587604,5,B00567TCD8,"This product is a great buy for anyone who is wanting to get the most out of their home theater, but don't want to pay the ridiculous prices that the Big-Box stores charge to set it up for you. It includes a tutorial(with Goofy demonstrating, it IS a Disney product after all!!)on what home theater components are, what you will need to set it up, how to set it up properly, etc..

  Once that is complete, you move into the meat and potatoes of the disc, which is the setup and calibration sections. There are multiple screens to go through to calibrate and get that New HDTV looking better than it was in the store! One great feature this disc has with these screens, is that the true black/white/color shape moves every so often so you can see it. Which helps, because your eye will start seeing what it thinks is the shape if you stare at a stationary object too long. And you have the tendency to add more brightness/contrast than is really necessary.

  Disney has included Calibration-specific setups for different types of HDTV's as well, so make sure YOU choose the right one!! Not a deal-ender if you do, it just may make your picture look a little funky because it is setup for a different type of TV.

  There are also different calibration setups based on experience level. While it is geared towards the entry-level shopper, Disney has included some great tools for the home Audio/Technophile, or installer on a budget, like the pixel-flipper.

  Disney also included clips from movies on this disc in the Blu-Ray format so that you can look at the HDTV in actual use and compare it to the settings you had previously. All without having to remove the disc from your player. All of the clips presented are Disney/Pixar movies. And while they do plug them for sale in this section, it is still a good feature to have on the disc, as it saves you from swapping discs frequently to see how it looks.

  Not to be overlooked are the several Audio tools that help you with the setup of your Home Theater Speakers. There are test sounds that you can use to make sure you speakers are hooked up correctly for a beginner. And for the advanced user, there are tests you can use with a Sound Pressure Level (SPL) meter to see how much performance you are really getting out of that speaker system.

  Bottom Line:I would highly recommend this disc for anyone who is just getting started on setting up their home theater. It will help you get so much more out of it!! And for more experienced Audiophiles/Technophiles, you will be pleasantly surprised at the depth of tools available on this disk. Don't just assume because it has the Disney name on it it's geared towards the neophyte crowd!",1306022400,15,2695,4.556016597510373

I purchased this one cause it was newer and I had other TV's i wanted to calibrate. After running the first few tests, I realized that my new 2011 Plasma was under utilized. I ran the test and calibrated it to the WOW and noticed a dramatic increase in color, brightness, shades of black. 2 people wearing different black suits next to each other with shadows, PERFECT!

I highly recommend this for anyone with a Blu Ray player and/or a 7.1 receiver.

It is definitely not a problem fixing tool like HD-DVE, AVS, or Spears-Munsil. WOW is only a good, visual correction tool from the user menu. For a more skilled calibration from the service menu of a HDTV you will need much more. For more precise and accurate measurements like grayscale and color management, I found the WOW disc lacking in usefullness and range of options, compared to my HD-DVD Video Essentials disc (HD-DVE). As mentioned earlier, the Wow disc is very good for visually improving image structure. And it has some beaautiful pictures to observe your results. But its measurement tools are just not precise or comprehensive enough to dial it in as closely as the more sohisticated tools like Spears munsil and HD-DVE. Those tools have 10 step grayscale options for example. WOW does not. I defintitely recommend this product strongly for the casual or everyday viewer who want to improve picture quality. It will help them achieve this. Modern day displays are so good right out of the box, you will hardly know what you're missing anyway. But it will not enable one to dial in a professional grade, eye popping, image that will stun everyone like the more detailed programs like HD-DVE. That is why I rate this product a strong 3-4 star performer. I own it. I like it. but I only use it after calibration with my HD-DVE to visually compare images. Not to dial them in.

However, I am also one of those people who are unable to leave well enough alone and is never satisfied with out-of-the-box settings. Having relied on the THX Optimizer to calibrate my various televisions over the years, the results were always scattershot and I find myself constantly having to make minor adjustments here and there all the time.

Enter Disney's WOW: World of Wonder disc. This is  a wonderful tool, and having spent many hours running it on my 50"" Panasonic Viera 3D plasma panel and my 40"" Sony Bravia LCD panel,  I have to admit they have never looked better.

4587619,5,B00567TCD8,"I heard this product recommended by Scott Wilkinson of Ultimate AV Mag on Leo Laporte's Tech Guy radio show (KFI 640 am).  He told the caller that the two most popular calibration discs are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Digital-Video-Essentials-HD-Basics-Blu-ray/dp/B000V6LST0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Digital Video Essentials: HD Basics [Blu-ray</a>] or Disney's WOW.  I had already tried the Digital Video Essentials and was extremely dissatisfied and didn't get any results.

So I gave Disney's WOW a try and was blown away by the results I was able to achieve.  I used it on our other TV upstairs and on my mom's new TV.

Disney WOW provides you with the ""What"", ""Why"", and finally the ""How"" for both video and audio calibration.  For every setting (brightness, contrast, etc.) there was 3-part menu that first explained the concept behind the setting, then demonstrated how to work with the test pattern (called a ""PLUGE""), and then finally showed the raw PLUGE pattern for you to keep on screen until the calibration was complete.

It turns out that this is more important than I thought.  My mom's brand new 54"" Panasonic was very far out of calibration.  It only took me about a half hour to dial it in though.

Just as valuable was the audio.  I wasn't really expecting much from the audio portion, but it turned out to be a godsend for setting up my mom's home theater.  Mom's speakers were already installed, but none of the wires were labeled.  So I turned on the audio calibration test, which is just an image and voice cycling from left front, center, right front, right rear, left rear, and sub.  It was still a frustrating playing whack-a-mole with the signal as it cycled around.  It would have been simpler for me if the voice could have repeated ""left front - left front - left front..."" until I matched the right wire with the right connection, but that's MY problem.

There's also a very helpful test for checking the polarity of the speakers.  If you connect them wrong (+/-), then the sound will be out of phase for that speaker.  It's tricky to detect without a decent test like this.

All in all, this calibration system is a must for any home entertainment system.  Even if you just buy one and share it with your friends.  You've probably dropped a couple thousand bucks on your home theater.  You should spend a few more dollars and an hour or so to dial it in perfectly!

The funny thing about this product is that it combines a TON of educational content in with the diagnostics (in different sections).  I don't know if it's just me, but I was pretty impatient to get to the heart of the diagnostics section so I could crank through the calibration and be done with it.  But I went back and watched the rest of the material to learn more about the technology.  I feel like I should get some kind of certification now, because now I know all about things like frame rates, interlaced signals, and so on.",1297900800,9,2980,4.8055009823182715

My main issue is that it really just doesn't go through that many settings to tweak. For example, I have at least 15 settings on my Samsung plasma that can be ""tuned"". With this Bluray, all I wound up changing with it was the darkness level, the sharpness, and the color. That was literally it. According to the bluray, my saturation and whatnot were already perfect, but I can tell just looking at the TV that the settings are less than optimal. Same story goes for the other two tvs.

From the reviews, I had hoped for a more in-depth calibration bluray. This one doesn't do a bad job, but I think it really just scratches the surface of calibrating. Two of the three tvs didn't look noticeably different when I was done, and the third one just had the brightness way too low from the get-go.

There's also audio calibration so you can look for bad or delayed speaker sound and even test how low or high the frequencies can go.  Each calibration exercise does a great job of first explaining what to look for and then allowing you to make the necessary changes.

Overall, we're very satisfied.  Right now this may cost a little more than the other calibration discs on the market, but ease of use and the solid results really make it worth trying especially if you can't justify the cost of a specialist.

I've got several other DIY ""calibration"" DVDs and this one is by far the easiest to use (particularly for first-timers) and does a better than average job of fine-tuning your HDTV. It's the best investment you can possibly make in optimizing the performance of your new DLP, LCD, LED/LCD or plasma HDTV and you'll be rewarded with much better images than your display exhibited out of the box. And, while it won't allow you to properly adjust the color management system or fine-tune the grayscale performance that professional calibrators are able to do (with a $10,000+ plus investment in equipment and training!), it will get you much closer to industry standards and eliminate some of the more common adjustment problems such as the ""torch mode"" that most HDTV sets exhibit out of the box. Highly recommended and definitely well worth the small investment of time and money. You'll also be better informed about what it takes to make great pictures (and convincing surround sound) and your home entertainment quotient is bound to increase significantly. Try it, you'll definitely like it. Who knows? You might even be so impressed with how much your HDTV performance has increased that you'll go to the Imaging Science Foundation website (www dot imagingscience dot com) and contact a professional calibrator to take you the rest of the way to the maximum performance your new HDTV is capable of with a professional ISF calibration.",1292025600,340,1659,5.036363636363636

However I found out very quickly that this Blu-ray version is Region Free, not Region 1 as indicated
in the Disney WOW Blu-ray specifications.

Amazon please note.
