I love the film very much, but I must agree thle last scene was really a little bit too surrealistic. Anyone remember The Shop on the Main Street?",1041120000,4,256,4.354166666666667
1648197,5,B00005QFE6,"This is a terrific, warm, and beautiful film.  It successfully examines a cross section of the Nazi occupation period in Eastern Europe.  It lovingly narrates the WWII experience of a handful of seemingly ordinary people.  It elaborates on the troubled evolution of the complex relationship between people and things Czech, German and Jewish.  It is endearing and uplfiting. The film subtly confronts and employs some of the stereotyped character types of the war and occupation era.  But does so only to undermine and overturn them eventually, ever so gently.  ""Divided We Fall"" is immensely funny in a traditionally Czech bittersweet manner.  The entire cast is wonderful.  The quirky soundtrack complements the film very well.  Photography makes more than excellent use of dreamy natural light, and the movie is a visual joy as well. A highly recommended cinematic pleasure overall!",1041120000,18,885,5.309352517985611
1648198,4,B00005QFE6,"As an Oscar nominee for Foreign Films, this movie has been brushed aside by many critics.  It is relatively unknown in comparison to the fanfare that tends to accompany an Oscar nominee these days.  The fact that the movie came out one year after Life is Beautiful didn't help either.  In a lot of people's mind, it must have been seen as an imitator, a movie riding on the wave of the much beloved La Vita e Bella.
Divided We Fall is a very dark comedy telling a story about trust, betrayal and redemption.  It does not try to mask the ugliness of human nature during a war.  It draws laughs closer to uncomfortable grins, watching the characters get into very compromising situations.  Every character is flawed in some ways, and although good triumphs in the end, we have to question if it is inherent in everyone.
Part of the social commentary that might be easily overlooked is the criticism towards the indifferent attitude of the Czech people towards separating the morally right from wrong.  This has been frequently documented in books like Tina Rosenberg's ""The Haunted Land"".  Amid Josef and Maria's kind souls, lie a backdrop of ignorance and indifference.  People seem too easy too bend, too willing to trade in righteousness for comfort.  Even Josef and Maria bicker, wavering in their belief that what they do is right.
Divided a Fall is film that truly deserves a viewing.  It might not be the most touching or beautiful film you will ever see.  It has its flaws, like the slow-motions that simply refuses to go away.  In it, perhaps you will find the old saying that art mimics life.  And the life you will find here is far from perfect.  Instead you will find one full of compromises and makes you wonder if life is indeed so beautiful after all.",1030492800,7,1764,4.627009646302251

1648200,5,B00005QFE6,"What a wonderful movie! We enjoyed the true signs of humanity throughout the movie. It is refreshing to see, how the struggle, just to survive during the cruel WWII is filmed in such a true but understanding way. And instead of revenge in the end, which would only follow a boring ""good vs. evil"" plot, people not only forgive each other, they FEEL, that they actually always will somehow belong together. In the end, David Wiener, who was 2 years hidden in a small closet space says about Mr. Prohaska, the Nazi-collaborator ""He was a decent man"", because he never denounced on his friends. Divided we fall.
A big congratulations to the director & the script - details and traces always find a fitting match later in the movie. And for once we have liked the various camera effects. A different kind of film material enhances in some scenes their surreal existence, supporting the distorted view of the protagonists in this human drama.
A highly recommended WWII drama, which is higher rated from us than ""Holocaust"" or ""Schindler's list"".",1010966400,13,1040,4.815642458100559

1648206,5,B00005QFE6,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

In Czech, the superb ""Divided We Fall"" is called ""Musme si pomhat,"" literally translated as ""We Must Help Each Other."" The story begins with a series of three short vignettes starting in 1937, and then skipping two years ahead twice until we're in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia in 1941. During these short scenes, we witness the falling fortunes of the Wieners, a well-off Jewish family, who are about to be shipped out to extermination camps in Poland. David Weiner, the son who is in his late 20s, naively believes that his family will be taken care of at Thereseinstadt, the ""model"" Nazi concentration camp which he later learns is a ""transfer station"" to the gas chambers.

The inciting incident occurs when David turns back up in his old town after escaping from Auschwitz, looking for some kind of shelter and protection. Josef, formerly an employee of the Weiners, finds David hiding at the Weiner family's old villa. Josef tells David he can't stay there as a German family is about to move in there the next morning. Josef brings David back to his home where his wife, Marie, gives David some food, and they try and figure out what to do.

David informs Josef that he plans to meet a friend the next morning so Josef drives him to the appointed meeting place in the pouring rain. When the friend fails to show up, Josef just cannot abandon David and drives him back to his home, where he and his wife agree to shelter him in a hidden pantry until the war ends.

The tension in the plot comes mainly from the most unusual character, Horst, who worked for the Weiners before the war and reported directly to Josef. Born in Bohemia, Horst is an ethnic German, who is married to a German woman. Horst has a secret crush on Marie, who is the main object of his visits. Horst is a Nazi collaborator who eventually conscripts Josef to work with him in his primary job--confiscating Jewish property from the Jews who are about to be shipped away to Poland. Josef agrees to work with Horst since the job will take away any suspicion that he may be hiding a Jew in his home. The down side is that the neighbors come to believe that Josef is now collaborating with the Nazis.

""Divided We Fall"" is an unusual film as the Holocaust is treated from a comic viewpoint. It's been said that comedy is almost like tragedy, but at the last moment one ""looks away."" Thus, as Andrew James Horton says in his review of the film, director H'ebejk portrays the German occupation as ""relatively peaceful, albeit a tense peace."" Tragedy intrudes only directly once when David tells Marie about how his sister was given an opportunity to become a Kapo (Jewish police officer) in the concentration camp, but she was required to beat her parents to death, to obtain such a promotion. The Nazis' cruelty is presented with subtlety--during a raid when they're looking for banned foodstuffs, a Nazi officer shoots a Czech woman's dog; another example is the remark about Dr. Fischer, who sterilized 1,000 Roma (gypsies).

Horton sees ""Divided We Fall"" as a ""a ground-breaking film, in that it challenges Czechs, a nation that always likes to think of itself as a passive victim, to consider the actively inglorious aspect of its past."" Horst alludes to the fact that he was mistreated as a child before the war, due to the fact he was an ethnic German. And after the war was over, many Czechs didn't want to be reminded there were sinister, bloody reprisals against the ethnic Germans, whom they regarded as collectively guilty. In a brilliant scene toward the end of the film, as Josef runs through the streets seeking help for his wife who is about give birth, the reprisals are underway, including a glimpse of decapitated heads inside a hearse.

""Divided We Fall"" proceeds fitfully in a series of plot reversals that bring the narrative to a dazzling climax. Horst's charge, the commandant Dr. Kepke, falls from grace after his young son deserts from the German army, and Horst must find him another place to live. After being rejected by Marie (after the two go on a car trip to the countryside, where the boorish collaborator attempts to rape her), Horst gets his revenge by insisting that Josef and Marie take in the now depressed Kepke. Marie stymies Horst's plan to have Kepke move in with them by claiming she's pregnant; Josef realizes however, he's just been certified sterile so their only hope is for David to impregnate Marie.

Earlier Horst comes to believe that Josef and Marie have been hiding a Jew in their home (after hearing the voices of Marie giving French lessons to David through the drain pipe), and is about to expose David's hiding place, when a German raid begins. So it's Horst who protects the family as a ""citizen of the Reich."" Nonetheless, after the town is liberated by the Russians, Horst is imprisoned and beaten as a collaborator. In the irony of all ironies in the film, Franta, Josef's neighbor who was going to turn David in when he first appeared in town after his escape, is now part of a citizen's brigade who is responsible for sitting in judgment on all his neighbors during the wartime occupation.

The theme of the film's denouement is forgiveness. Josef anoints Horst as the doctor who delivers Marie's baby. Franta, feeling guilty over how he treated David, overlooks Horst's past indiscretions and he is accepted back into the community. And in a classic moment of redemption, Josef holds up the newborn and gazes toward a table where the deceased members of the Wiener family along with Kepke's deserter son, sit. Out of the darkness, there is hope. ""Divided We Fall"" is a film that must be seen!",1421539200,,5668,4.705645161290323

There is so much to glean from all the human interaction and subtle complexities of living amongst  fear, hate and control, and the fight to hold on to your own integrity and principles during an abysmally abnormal time. We have watched it many times over and never cease to find more and more nuance and meaning to chew on.

1648215,5,B00005QFE6,"This Oscar-nominated Czech film of 2000 is one of the best I have seen.  A masterful balance of comedy with drama,  it tells the story of citizens in German-occupied Czechoslovakia near the end of World War II.  Marie and Josef are depicted in their day-to-day life as they try to avoid drawing the attention of the Nazis.  They don't  want to risk taking in David (a Jewish friend) but they cannot imagine refusing, so he lives hidden in their attic for two years.  Horst, a prewar friend and boorish Nazi collaborator, drops in frequently.  It is hard to explain how such a serious setting could create a comedy of errors and then swing around at the end to become totally inspiring and redemptive.  Abnormal times do strange things to normal people, sometimes bringing out the worst and surprisingly the best as well, reminding us that we all need to be forgiving and to hope for forgiveness.",1348617600,,895,4.6923076923076925

1648218,5,B00005QFE6,"""Divided We Fall"" is a unique Holocaust drama in that the focus is not on the horrors of the Holocaust such as the mass deportations, the barbaric conditions of the death camps, etc. Instead, it focuses on a pair of ordinary people, Gentiles who are compelled to lead abnormal lives under abnormal circumstances. Josef and Marie Cizek (Boleslav Polivka and Anna Siskova) are an ordinary married couple living in occupied Czechoslovakia during WW II. Josef is a regular guy who does not really want to face up to the realities of war, and the fact that his young and beautiful wife is desperate to have children, something they haven't been able to realize for many years. Things take a drastic turn one day when the Jewish son of Josef's former employer comes to him for shelter, having recently escaped a death camp in Poland and lost all of his family. Josef takes him in without really giving thought to the repercussions and therein begins the real drama. Josef and Marie hide David Wiener (Csongor Kassai) in their pantry, but realize that the situation is immensely risky, especially given the frequent and impromptu visits by Josef's friend, Horst (Jaroslav Dusek) who also happens to be a Nazi collaborator, and who is obsessed with Marie. To avert suspicion, Josef decides to take up Horst on a job offer which requires them to assist the Nazis in confiscating Jewish property which helps them for a while, though the rest of the neighborhood looks upon them as Nazi collaborators.

What makes this movie engaging and interesting is the interplay of human relationships - that between Josef and Marie, Marie and David, Josef & Horst, and Horst and Marie, among others. The comical and many times tense/suspenseful situations seem altogether credible under the assured direction of Jan Hrebejk - one can actually imagine being in such situations, they are compellingly portrayed on screen. Marie's character as played by Anna Siskova elicits genuine empathy from the viewer, and whilst Josef is not exactly a likable character, one can't help feeling sorry for the impossible situation he finds himself in and his character makes a nice contrast to that of his greasy, and venal friend Horst, who is the epitome of the fawning and opportunistic collaborator.

The humor in this drama is dark and at times morbid, but it is not misplaced - in fact, it is used effectively to explain the insidious nature of the Nazis and how the policies of the Third Reich as carried out in occupied territories had a profound impact not only on the Jews but also on the rest of the population. Life under the Nazis was far from ordinary, despite their efforts to portray otherwise, and ""Divided We Fall"" gives viewers a glimpse of how normal people are driven to extremes under extraordinary circumstances. The feature is rated PG-13 (with some scenes of violence and suggested sex).The feature is in Czech, with the option of English subtitles (which I thought was rather well-done and not stilted as in some subtitled productions). There are no real bonus features worth mentioning. On the whole though, this is a compelling and unique Holocaust drama that is well worth the watch for those who are interested in the genre.",1263945600,3,3217,4.900917431192661
1648219,5,B00005QFE6,"I have spent much of my 56 years studying the Holocaust in an amatuer effort to comprehend the incomprehensible.  I have found a lot to learn in fiction as well as fact.  There are a number of excellent movies with Holocaust themes.  ""Divided We Fall"" deals with the subject through the perspective of a Czech family who hides an escaped Jewish concentration camp inmate.  The film begins with a good sequence of scenes that enables us to see the changing roles and relationships between former comrades.  We are focussed on one couple and their challenge to cope with the circumstances that are thrust upon them.  There is suspense, romance, and a surprising amount of comedy mixed into the film.  About midway through the movie (and continuing for awhile) I got the impression that ""Divided We Fall"" was not a great film.  Good but not great because it seemed that there were too many unnecessary scenes.  However, as the film began to accelerate towards its' climax, I realized that everything was coming together in a way that I hadn't anticipated.  The climax and the positive examples it gave me left me with a special and warm appreciation of what the director, Jan Hrebejk, meant to share with us.  Most Holocaust and related films leave me with an emptiness rather than a fullness but Hrebejk uses hatred and distrust to show us love and reliance.  Watching ""Divided We Fail"" was a very moving experience.",1225929600,2,1414,4.797520661157025
1648220,4,B00005QFE6,"This film isn't going to be like the WWII/Shoah film the average person expects.  Instead of focusing on a lot of atrocities and tragedies, almost all of the focus is all on the one couple, Josef and Maria, their Jewish friend David (whose father was Josef's old boss), and Josef and Maria's collaborator friend Horst.  The first five minutes of the film give us very short vignettes from 1937, 1939, and 1941, and are pretty much useless, since we're never told who these people are and what their relationship is, apart from giving the viewer an idea of how life changed from the prewar era to after the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia.  The real meat of the story begins in 1943, when Josef and Maria agree to take in their old friend David, who has escaped from Poland after being interned in Terezin, the sole survivor of his family (the people we saw very brief glimpses of in 1939 and 1941).  He came back to the old neighborhood because it's what he knows, and figured, perhaps navely, that surely there would be someone who would help him.  At great personal risk to themselves, his old friends agree to hide him in a closet in their apartment.  This is no easy matter in wartime or under occupation, not least of all because one of Josef's best friends, Horst, is of German descent and therefore profitting greatly now that his people are the ones in power.  In addition to Horst's frequent unannounced (and often unwanted) visits and attempts to bed Maria, they also must deal with Horst's boss, a German commandant whom Josef also later agrees to go to work for (prior to that he'd been sleeping through the war and not working).  One never knows what is going to happen next, if they'll be turned in by Horst, who suspects or outright knows their secret, if their secret will be discovered by their Czech neighbors or the German occupiers whom Josef has to pretend to be buddy-buddy with to survive, or what anyone's fate might be after the liberation arrives.  There are also many fine moments of comedy, none of it forced or overdone.

The film works because the characters are so nuanced and complex.  Instead of relying on clichs and one-dimensional stereotypes, the characters are multi-faceted people, with both positive and negative attributes.  Horst, the German sympathiser, may be a vulgar boor and a collaborator, but his actions demonstrate that he also possesses humanity, kindness, and loyalty.  His boss Dr. Kepke might be a high-ranking Nazi, but he's also shown as a father who loves and cares about his sons, someone with normal human feelings behind the uniform.  Even Josef and Maria aren't shown as complete saints just because they've agreed to hide David.  They have normal human weaknesses and have the typical problems couples do, in their case particularly because they're still childless after many years of marriage in spite of Maria's fervent prayers to the Virgin Mary to grant them a child.  Even the victorious liberators from the Soviet Army, the Czech Home Army, and the Czech partisans aren't depicted as completely understanding and benevolent people just because they're on the winning side.  These are people who do what they had to survive, even if some of those things went against everything they had believed in before the war.  And in spite of the potential for it given the storyline, the film is never emotionally manipulative or morally heavy-handed.  The final scene of the film in particular is very moving.  This is one foreign film and historical drama that deserves to be better-known.",1186963200,10,3551,4.838016528925619

""[T]yrannical regimes always seem to have one common link---their deep hatred for Jews."" The words are from a Warren Kozak opinion piece (which appeared in the New York Sun August 21, 2006). It's hardly a new idea, of course, yet most of the world still seems disinclined to acknowledge it. Blatant anti-Semitism is thus not just something for Jews to worry about. All folks who champion freedom thus, in effect, ought see themselves as part Jewish themselves: either you stand with the persecuted or you are just putting off the day when you might just as likely be faced with similar persecution. That's the central point of ""Divided We Fall""---""the true and bittersweet story of a Czechoslovakian couple whose village has been taken over by Nazis during World War II."" When a Jewish friend escapes from German confinement and makes his way back to their common neighborhood, the couple has a choice to make. ""I lived here all my life,"" says the man on the run in the film, ""so I thought maybe someone here might help me."" But what makes this film unique is the notion that non-Jews really need to wed Jews (metaphorically) to stand up against anti-Semitism; for, without a union of some sorts, they are looking for trouble to come their way eventually. How the film presents this point is most unusual, but I won't get into specifics here, not wishing to give away crucial plot details. Suffice it say that the film exaggerates the above to make its point very clearly and does so with much style and accomplishment. That it's a Czech-made story only reinforces the idea that if you sacrifice a people (as Britain & France did) it's only going to temporarily put off the day of your own reckoning with the evil at hand.

1648225,5,B00005QFE6,"There has been a spate of fin de siecle films that have sought to undermine the general gloom and doom spectre of the Nazi regime. To take any other than the orthodox view is courageous and especially edifying as the films emanate from the occupied locales of suffering. 'Underground's' carnival flavour was festive at times, though I found the misogyny disturbing even accepting the plausibility of the plot. 'Life Is Beautiful', was  really a supreme one-liner. But Jan Hrebjk's,'Divided We Fall' I'd nominate as the best of the bunch, for its farcical ferocity. The Czech town is occupied by Nazi invaders and its power structures, class and race, are inverted. The script is tight, tingling with one-liners, and given embodiment by a brilliant ensemble of lead characters. The reluctant hero, Joseph (the droll Bolek Poliuka)who'd rather have slept the duration of the war in hope that life would return to normal, is thrust to defend his Jewish neighbour. His valour, therefore, is dragged from him. Honour, allegiance, morality - all  community values are deeply questioned, and definitively framed by their former friend, now a Nazi collaborator, who, in praise of Hitler has adopted the fuhrer's hairstyle down to the moustache. He's an ingratiating fellow who leeches after Joseph's wife. So many swift and sudden shifts of affiliation occur. The German Commandant, more than any Czech, is totally undone by the loss of three successive sons to the slaughter, and his wife to the asylum. Never has a title been more apt. This moves with the speed of Fawlty Towers and in the gangling Poliuka draws a touchingly real story brimming with comic insights and naive, good intent. I can't recall a film since,'Jesus of Montreal' that so exquisitely incorporates a Christian tale. Here, the 'miraculously' conceived infant, promotes a vision of resurrection in 'father', Joseph of the reunited family of the Commandant. Even during this epiphany,Hrebjk mischieviously has the infant peeing in his dad. The Germans sit at a table midst a pile of rubble. It's a climactic guesture of reconciliation and forgiveness.",1126051200,3,2115,5.163265306122449

Plot-wise, it is a gripping film because it touches upon the psychological impact of ordinary people caught up in violent, murderous, tumultuous times. The repercussions of the Holocaust upon the millions of lives of those who have been effected is inestimable. Europe is still reeling from the damage not only in terms of loss of life and physical suffering, but also emotional scars that are personal, social, national and international. This movie is but a microcosm that explores a struggle with conscience, confused loyalties and unwilling participants caught up in sheer madness. The acting is excellent. The directing is tight without dragging or creating melodrama, and the story line is compelling.",1112745600,4,865,5.462686567164179

The ""moral"" of the story -- that we must help each other survive through the hard times -- is never heavy handed, but it a natural extension of the situation the characters find themselves in. The ending is a treasure and one that doesn't feel contrived or unnatural.

The only fault I could find is that the first five minutes seem somewhat irrelevant, since I never could figure out for sure who the people were in the ""pre war"" clips. And it doesn't really matter. You can pick the film up when it reaches ""the present"" time of the action.",1112140800,13,829,4.411764705882353
1648228,5,B00005QFE6,"""Divided We Fall"" is a great Czech Republic film from 2000, starring Bolek Polivka, Anna Siskova, and Csongor Kassai.  It earned an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film.  It desplicts a couple, Josef and Maria, from Czechoslavakia (now Czech Republic and Slavakia) who's devastated that they are unable to bear children.  Josef begins losing all hope in life.  Little do they know that their lives will become affected by the Holocaust.  Suddenly, David, one of his ex-employee's family members and a lone survivor of a Polish massacre, enters their apartment in search of help.  They risk their lives to hide him from the Nazis.
Through these intense chain of events, the hard-hitting impact is always present.  Such powerful theme keeps audiences watching closely.  This powerful film desplicts the Holocaust's hardships wonderfully, brutal and beyond heartbreaking.  The emotion aspect builds as lives change forever, namely Josef's renewed life outlook.  The unique camera effects in certain scenes dig deeper into the characers' surroundings.  Such film quality gives the brilliant plot its viewing enjoyment up to the surprising conclusion.  The performers add their own sense of emotional value to this, namely Polivka, Siskova, and Kassai.  Kassai's captivating performance as David alone offers the unforgettable experience through his character's life threatening struggles.
""Divided We Fall"" is yet another great Holocaust-based film that will continue pleasing its audiences.  This will not be forgotten by any of them.",1087171200,24,1533,5.551724137931035
1648229,5,B00005QFE6,"This film takes place in Czechoslovakia during World War II. It deals with the realities of action and interaction between ordinary people living in extraordinary times. The main characters are forced to live and make choices they would not normally make in everyday life.
I really enjoyed this film as an expression of the Czech psyche in reconciling the devastating effects of WWII. The director clearly indicates that no one was innocent in those perilous times and that due to the force of external events, people did not behave properly, even when the war was over. This was a deep and moving story. Along with the other reviewers I found the ending a little to surreal, but maybe if I were a Czech it would make a little more sense. Other than that, a well told, well acted movie that is well worth watching.",1076630400,,814,4.659722222222222
1648230,5,B00005QFE6,"Against all odds, and against our own fears, sometimes we find ourselves doing things we would not imagine doing. Sometimes we might even find that we do these things, which are ethically correct, against our wills. The main characters in Divided We Fall, Josef and Maria, are a married couple who end up harboring a Jewish acquaintance in their cellar for three years. They do not necessarily do this at first because they feel compelled by morality to do so, but more from guilt or because they don't really see another alternative. The couple sought calm and quiet and to stay out of the path of the onslaught of war and its politics, but in the end found themselves right in the mix. Indeed, to conceal their hidden ""guest"", they had to play the role of Nazi collaborator, which of course alienated all their neighbors and nearly cost them once the Nazis were driven out. Naturally all the twists and turns of the couple taking David (the Jewish ""guest"") in play out with some humor and some drama and even some moral and ethical questions... this is handled so subtly and deftly.",1076025600,2,1084,4.651041666666667

7950419,5,B00005QFE6,"My husband and I watched this excellent film some years ago and were entirely taken by its delightful approach to life-threatening situations, based on true events, which occurred during World War II in German-occupied Czechoslovakia.

Probably for the individuals portrayed, things were never amusing or whimsical, as they sometimes appear in this clever film, but this is a far more realistic look at World War II than that presented in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-Is-Beautiful/dp/B00B3EJ0OY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life Is Beautiful</a>, which appeared nearly a decade earlier.

Here there is genuine fear, nail biting and worry.

Most likely that owes to the fact that the film is based on real events.

Suffice it to say that this film is life-affirming, and totally worthwhile.

We loved it.",1512604800,,852,6.066666666666666

Forget any preconceived notions from The Piano, Life is Beautiful, or Schindler's List, all great films. This is a smaller movie and so powerful in its realistic characterizations and direction.

And believe it or not, there is some great humor.

A very uplifting movie about the power of forgiveness and what people do to survive.",1479254400,,500,5.073170731707317
