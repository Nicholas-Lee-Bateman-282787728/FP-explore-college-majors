8386364,1,B0030ZOYFE,"I wanted Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce only.  This has many Sherlock and Watson films that I don't care for at all.  Sorry, I am such a fan of Rathbone and Bruce.  Of the four discs, the first one didn't even work.  Oh well, you can't win them all.",1417219200,,249,4.020408163265306
8386365,1,B0030ZOYFE,I was disappointed in this DVD because Basil  r athbone and Nigel Bruce are featured on the cover but only ten percent of the dvd featured them. They were the reason I purchased it,1395187200,5,180,4.294117647058823
8386366,2,B0030ZOYFE,"Please note that this set is of various Sherlock Holmes movies from 1931 to 1967, done by various actors and directors.  By viewing the DVD jacket, you might assume Basil Rathbone was the actor portraying Holmes.  Actually, of the 10 videos, only 3 contain Basil Rathbone (who I feel does the best job of any actor, bringing the Sherlock Holmes character to life).  If you are a fan of any Sherlock Holmes movie, you won't be disappointed with the content.

Video quality of the set is quite poor, all of the movies appear to be copies of copies.",1379721600,8,546,4.540816326530612
