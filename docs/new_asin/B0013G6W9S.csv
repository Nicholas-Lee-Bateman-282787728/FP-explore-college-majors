8250862,5,B0013G6W9S,"I immediately became enveloped in the plots of the characters upon my discovery of this Australian primetime serial (1982-1987) on YouTube.  There is a member there with quite a playlist of episodes from the series & it is really worth a look for other americans to see how great a show Sons & Daughters truly is.  What a shame this DVD is region 0 & incompatible with mainstream NTSC players.  Yes, I've got a video converter, but given this day & age & what's viable in the distribution market on american DVD, I'm amazed this hasn't gone to NTSC/US DVD.  TV Shows On DVD has a website.  Let them know you want to see this on DVD!",1253750400,2,632,4.367521367521367
