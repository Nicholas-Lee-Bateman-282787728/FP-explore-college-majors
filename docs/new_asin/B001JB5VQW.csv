8689872,5,B001JB5VQW,I have had my Mom's On The Move DVD for about 3 years.  It is great if you are looking for a quick and EFFECTIVE work out.  It is also good on days when you may have a little extra time to do 2 of the segments back to back!  I would recommend this to everyone Beginner to the most in shape person because she shows modifications along with higher intensity versions of the same moves.,1314403200,,384,4.026315789473684
