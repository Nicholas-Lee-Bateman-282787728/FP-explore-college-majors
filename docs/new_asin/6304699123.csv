Although it could help to be stoned to watch this film if you choose not to be it's a wonderful visual document of a New York City that no longer exists and of a group of young filmmakers, some of which went to lofty heights in the filmmaking community. Weather the absurdity and you will be blessed with a wonderful document of a time that is seldom accurately shown anywhere. If you go into it expecting to have fun with a group of Cinestes you will not be disappointed.",1477785600,,586,4.288288288288288
7876490,3,6304699123,"Coen Brothers' moviemaking combined with Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis storytelling: lo and behold, you'll have Lloyd Kaufman's The Battle of Love's Return, an art house film with a twist of abstract surrealism, or the next wave of avant-garde realism.

The transformation comes when Abacrombie, the lead character loses his nickel and dime job, because he had failed to deliver. The next words he hears are from his boss: you're fired. These words send him reeling onto the boulevard of lost hope. From there, he goes to a New York City, Manhattan, donut shop where he sees his dream girl, played by the pretty Lynn Lowry. Nevertheless, his dream of hooking up with her, is nothing but a dream. Jobless, he's now a bona fide loser: pitiless, warped self-esteem.

In this art house movie, Manhattan plays a big role.  From the gritty feel of the streets to the gritty, sombre, dark pornography bookstore, Manhattan plays a part in this movie like it did in the academy award winning movie: Midnight Cowboy. The big city is everywhere from its hustle and bustle street crowds to its towering concrete structures: bridges and buildings. In this movie, one should also keep one's eyes open for a bit part played by the Academy Award winner director Oliver Stone.

The battle of love's return was made on a low budget in 1971. Maybe a reason for its artistic bend; to say the least, it's whimsical.

The plot line, however, is there. Abacombie gets fired, and he then sees his fantasy. dream girl. Yet outside of the simple plot, the rest is murky, whimsy, and abstract. If art house, movies are enjoyed, add another star to this review; it's an Art movie. The movie is dreamlike, abstract, and vague. It's filled with images of concrete edifices, then switches to surrealism dreaminess.

It's also funny.  For example, upon losing his job, Abacombie tries to help an elderly woman cross the street. He's taken for a weirdo by not only the elderly woman, but also by bystanders who respond to the woman's screams and pleas for help.

Like Gregor in The Metamorphosis, the lead character, played by Lloyd Kaufman, who also wrote and produced this movie, needs to adapt to change: he lost his job and social identity. Upon failing to adopt, his chances of survival are nil and none. Once defeat and failure rears its ugly head, the environment consumes in this brutal, heartless, cold world showed artistically in this art house story.",1446595200,,2431,4.840963855421687
7876491,3,6304699123,"First let me apoligize, I usually have a clever saying at the top but this time I just can't think of anything. Anyway, onto the review.
  The single greatest director who ever lived, Lloyd Kaufman, made this back in 1971. It's a whimsical (but not the whimsical that means ""boring"", but whimsical meaning it's full of heart) look at a poor young man named Abercrombie who goes through alot of problems in life.
  Although not as Tromaliscious as Lloyd's newer works (""Terror Firmer"", ""Tromeo and Juliet"") it's still a darn good movie. Some parts are a little slow, but you must understand it was made for only $8,000 and in limited location. The movie does feature a cameo by Lloyd's childhood friend (seriously) Oliver Stone, and even some slightly-foul music that makes you wonder how it got a ""G"" rating. Of course, the MPAA are cruel bastards, but I won't get into that now.
  In short, ""The Battle Of Love's Return"" is a funny not-so-dark comedy that the whole family can watch. If you're not interested in that, it's still worth getting for the humorous opening with ""Oliver Stone"" and the very first ""Tromaville Cafe"" short.
