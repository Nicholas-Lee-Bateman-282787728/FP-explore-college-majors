331336,4,6301432819,"Not a great movie, but as far as this type of movie goes, it's pretty good. I am a Burt Reynolds fan. I own a ""Bandit"" Trans Am, okay. Speed Zone, though not as loaded with major star power as the first two Cannonball movies, is the best of these, better than the enjoyable Cannonball Run and miles better than the Cannonball Run II. I have not seen all of The Gumball Rally yet so I cannot compare. Speed Zone isn't plagued with all the obviously sped up footage and cheesy music as the first two. Also, it was filmed much better and actually has a large dose of actual cool driving. It really makes the first two look pretty old. They actually do a lot with the Countach and other cars and shoot it well. To be fair, a stunt (kit) car was used for the heavier Lamborghini stunts whereas the Cannonball movies just used a real one, though they did no where near the cool stuff.

Anyway it's got lots of comedy, lots of cars, good stunts, cool driving, more modern music, pretty girls, and is overall a more polished and better show. I can hardly see why fans of this type show would not like this last installment.

This needs to be released on DVD. I for one would buy it!",1150156800,22,1174,4.236607142857143
331337,3,6301432819,It's not a riot but there are some really funny scenes.  Probably the funniest scene involves one of the Smothers brothers confusing airline penuts with something else.,1085184000,3,168,5.222222222222222
331338,5,6301432819,"I don't understand why this movie gets bad reveiws? I think its a great film! Just because the only charactor from the previous 2 Cannonball movies (Jamie Farr) The Sheik makes a breif appearence, its no reason to down this great fun comedy! Like its previous 2 counterparts, its filled with a great cast... John Candy, Whats his name Father from American Pie, That blonde chick, the guy from Prokys, Smothers Brothers, Bo Duke, A whole heap more! Even tho i cant remember there names, dosent mean there not worth watching!
Sure there some over the top antics and stunts. But didn't the last two have that aswell?
This is a great movie IMo and I cant wait for it to finally be put on DVD...hopefully",1080777600,13,699,4.555555555555555
331339,5,6301432819,"This movie is by far the best movie in the world (according to my standards). After Cannonball Run and Cannonball 2 came Speed Zone, with such halarious actors like John Candy and Jackie Gleason. This 1989 movie would be a favorite for car lovers, having a Lamborghini Countach, a BMW 735iL, an Excalibur, a Jaguar XJS, a Ferrari Daytona Spyder, a Television crew Chevrolet van, and many more supercars. It is about a $50,000 race from Pennsylvania to California. The plot is about a valet parker (John Candy) who meets his high school ""friend"" (father of a teenager in American Pie) who always plays pranks on him, until he finds out he needs a driver for his BMW 735iL in an emergency. The ""friend's"" girlfreind is being treated badly by him, and falls in love with the valet parker. They don't win the race. When Candy is looking at a television screen at a small valet house, a scene from the Cannonball Run is being shown. Overall, a most excellent film, perfect for veiwing while on a road trip or on a Saturday night.",1024790400,7,1024,4.570652173913044
331340,4,6301432819,The Plot is so thin you can see through it.  But the opening credits feature a gorgeous Countach being chased by the police.  That alone is worth buying the movie for.  But added to that are a huge amount of star cameos and some of the best one liners you're going to find.  I wouldn't pay full price for this movie but its definitely worth the money...,1009324800,4,353,4.223880597014926
331341,5,6301432819,"You movie reviewers need to learn to just enjoy a movie for what it is and stop searching for some deeper meaning to the whole thing or whining about wasted talents of actors. Well let me fill you in: there is no deeper meaning. This is just a light, fun movie about a cross-country road race that isn't trying to win any academy awards. If you ask me, those academy awards a load of bunk anyway. Could Saving Private Ryan have been any more predictable and pre-packed, if you know what I mean? I don't think so. But all you reviewers sure bought it. I guess it's no coincidence that the vast majority of movies I enjoyed got bad reviews. But to y'all's credit, you were spot-on with Chicken Run...",981504000,3,698,4.376923076923077

331377,5,6301432819,"Some people say this is a slow or cheesy movie. So be it, naysayers! Watching the Lamborghini skip across the pond and the Jag jump a river are just a few of the funny scenes in this movie! The goofy characters (John Candy and Eugene Levy in particular) are well-casted. Levy plays a jerk really well! If you're looking for a good 'ol 80s comedy/quasi-action flick, this fits the bill. Probably never came out on DVD because it may not have done well in theaters. However, if you have a DVD recorder, you may be able to make a copy from your VCR if you really want it on DVD.",1342569600,2,575,4.236363636363636
