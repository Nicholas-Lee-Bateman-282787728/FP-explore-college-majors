4435866,2,B004NJC0FC,"We were very interested in this DVD because we hoped for a fascinating tale of that intrepid traveler--Ibn Battuta.  It starts off well enough but then only gives a brief glimpse into his journey to Mecca.  The story drifts from the past to the present and seems to just drop off leaving the viewers disappointed.  Some of the scenery is very nice and well-photographed of that dramatic landscape but the story line is quite disappointing. From the interviews at the end of the DVD, it seems that creating a film there was not without its challenges so the producers, directors and artists do have to be given some credit for the attempt and credit must also go to the authorities, who have only a small film industry,  for working with the filmmakers. If you do buy it, just know that it isn't a robust story of his journey.",1332806400,15,825,4.554054054054054

4435868,5,B004NJC0FC,A somber yet interesting movie into the past.  It shows the difference of the pilgrimage from the past compared with today. It also shows how difficult it used to be back in the days and how we take advantage of the situation today.,1324857600,8,232,4.395348837209302

4435892,5,B004NJC0FC,"I saw this movie in an IMAX theatre. Easily one of the most moving I have ever seen...it is so sweeping in the telling that a home television could never do it justice. Some movies are just like that. None the less, I am purchasing two copies for my sons because it reflects the true spirit of the Islam I know and identify with.",1358121600,,329,4.15625

4435894,3,B004NJC0FC,"To be quite honest, when I saw the preview I thought that this movie might be emotional and educational. But it was more of a documentary with demonstration involved.

8436676,4,B004NJC0FC,"This docu-drama is, without doubt, truly an exquisite film in its visual aspect. In fact, I find myself reminiscing about my own Hajj and journey to Makkah each time I view it.

Unfortunately, I also have a rather serious concern with regard to inaccurate information communicated in the opening voice over portion of the work. The misinformation conveyed is somewhat typical of media efforts of this magnitude (and so, may be unintentional) and yet, sadly, it goes to the heart of why (in part) so many misperceptions about Islam abound.

Specifically, yes, Abraham (may Allah be pleased with him) was an obedient prophet. And, with Allah's Guidance he worked to establish the rites of the Hajj. However, Muslims DO NOT perform Hajj to commemorate Abraham. We perform Hajj because our Lord, Allah, (Lord of All the Worlds) requires it of us.  In fact, in making Hajj one's intention must be correct.  That is to say, a Muslim who sets out to make Hajj must do so SOLELY with the ""intention"" of earning Allah's mercy and not for any other reason. Hajj is called the 5th ""pillar"" of Islam.

Islam is comprised of 5 pillars. They are (in their proper order) shahadah (a declaration of belief in Allah as the one and only true God), salat (the 5 mandatory daily prayers, etc), zakat (a tax paid on one's discretionary income for distribution among less fortunate Muslims), saum (fasting for Ramadan, etc) and Hajj (at least once in a lifetime, if one is able financially and physically). These pillars are the foundation upon which rests the integrity of a Muslim.

For more information and a deeper understanding I'd highly advise reading the Qur'an.",1407974400,,1648,4.846975088967971
