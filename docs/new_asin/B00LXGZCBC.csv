6509618,3,B00LXGZCBC,"I have loved this series so far and I will definitely buy this, but two episodes for this price is kinda a slap in the face to fans.  This is part of a disturbing trend I'm noticing.  If you liked DBZ back in the day and remember paying twenty dollars for three epsiodes you know what I mean.  Seriously, start releasing the entire series for a reasonable price (cough Ghost in the Shell Arise, Attack on Titan).",1412553600,3,412,4.324675324675325
6509619,5,B00LXGZCBC,Great series follows manga very well. I am amazed though that it took so long to make an official American release. I know Geneon went under but holy crap they finished this series 3-4 years ago.,1410739200,,195,4.444444444444445
6509620,4,B00LXGZCBC,"Well, it took them bloody well long enough to get to this point (pun intended), but I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. Anyway, the final battle is at hand, and it's gonna be a doozy! I highly recommend seeing this all the way through, even though the price may be somewhat prohibitive (really, FUNimation, I don't mind you guys making a profit from us anime fans, but you are pushing it!!!). I'll probably get this just to complete the set (and because I can), but I'm still holding out for a last-minute price break. I know, I'm just using Amazon to vent my frustrations; so sue me. The limited release has been completed. :)",1408579200,,627,4.508771929824562
6509621,3,B00LXGZCBC,The last 2 episodes are really good but 2 episodes for this price? Ridiculous.,1408320000,7,78,4.642857142857143
6509622,5,B00LXGZCBC,"After years of waiting the greatest of anime finally comes to a close I must say it has been a joy and a privileged to watch this outstanding piece of art. While the plot is simple the characters are quite complex and you can't help but love them. Kouta Hirano really is a genius his manga Hellsing is truly an awe inspiring fresh new take on the immortal king of vampires Dracula. The story is so remarkable that it is the only work I recognize as a continuation to Bram Stokers, Dracula. Any vampire fan who loves blood and gore and hates sparkling teenagers will love and must buy this.",1407888000,8,589,4.363636363636363
6509623,4,B00LXGZCBC,Very excited to have a set date to finally complete this series!,1407283200,,64,4.416666666666667
6509624,5,B00LXGZCBC,"I love Hellsing, and if you've stuck with it until this release, then that means you probably love it too. It's been one hell of a wait, especially for dub fans who went years without updates after the US branch of Geneon went under, but finally the end is here. Part of me is excited for teh final US release, although another part of me is also saddened. Hellsing was such an excellent anime, and it's one of those rare cases where the english cast works every bit as hard as the original, led by the peerless Crispin Freeman. Everything though, both vice casts, the music, the animation, the writing, is flawless. Here's to you Hellsing, it's been one hell of a ride.",1407283200,34,670,4.455284552845528
6509625,5,B00LXGZCBC,"This is the epic conclusion to the Hellsing Ultimate OVA series. I have watched these volumes through other channels so I can say that this is a must own! I do not know packing details, but for anyone who owns the first eight volumes, it is a no brainer to buy this. After the cliffhanger ending that was given to us with volume eight, you will be pleasantly surprised at what happens next if you haven't seen these or read the manga. And not a bad price to considering...",1406332800,12,472,4.314606741573034
6509626,5,B00LXGZCBC,"Finally! I have owned the first two blu ray sets containing Volumes 1-8 for awhile now. This show is absolutely incredible and better than most vampire/horror movies or shows out there. For the first time in North America these two volumes are being released, and they will make a bloody good time of watching. This set I definitely recommend to any who have seen the first 8 volumes so that there can be an end to this epic series. This will contain two 1 hour long episodes of Hellsing Ultimate along with some extras I'm sure. I can't wait to see Alucard (Arucard) back in the gory-action!!",1406073600,19,593,4.5514018691588785

In all seriousness, if you're looking for a great bloodbath in anime and can't get enough, you're in for a treat. Volumes 1-4 help set the scene perfectly and Volumes 5-8 launch you into the action. Volumes 9 & 10 present the final confrontation and conclusion beautifully, making this set worth every penny.

If you're unsure of whether or not you'll enjoy this, watch Hellsing Ultimate Abridged by TeamFourStar on YouTube. They did an amazing job of making the episodes funny without removing what the show offers. Don't get hung up if you think the language is too much, but do keep in mind that it is Rated TV-MA for a reason.",1488844800,,686,4.905172413793103

6509672,5,B00LXGZCBC,"Arguably the best anime series ever. Some of the dialogue is brilliant, albeit shocking. Great characters you will fall in love with. Even the villains. I should note, this is NOT for kids. The violence is brutal, gory & continuous. The misogony of some of the villains is offensive. If you think Game of Thrones is too extreme, you won't like Hellsing. But the animation is beautifully done, lifelike & fluid. The plot is absolutely gripping. The climax must be seen to be believed. This is a work of pop-culture art that I stll rewatch.",1481673600,,538,4.673684210526316

6509753,2,B00LXGZCBC,"I've been waiting on this ending forever. I didn't want to watch the rest of it in Japanese because I love Crispin Freeman's voice work so much. But jeeze I have never been so glad the final 2 episodes were over. They pretty much go like this. 30 seconds of fighting, 4 to 5 minutes of pointless monologues, maybe 5 seconds of actual of action, 2 to 3 more minutes of MORE monologues. Every time it shows the Major be prepared for a 2 to 3 minutes of pointless dialogue and near the end I was like ""OK I GET IT"" then MORE talking. If they cut out all the boring dialogue then the last 2 episodes would be maybe 30 minutes combined. It's obviously they drug this out to make it into 10 episodes. Never have I been so happy to see the ending credits of anything. In all honesty I'll probably never watch it again. If I had to recommend Hellsing then I'd go with the 13 episode long series. Although the animation is inferior, the music, and pacing far surpasses the ultimate series. Plus it doesn't have those Japanese comedy type scenes that just seem to break the flow of everything. Hoping for a bluray version of that. I was looking forward to this for years and was excited when it came in the mail. The series started off great but in the end I feel like it only drug itself out for far too long and ended being a boring anticlimactic mess.",1428451200,2,1344,4.25390625

6509786,5,B00LXGZCBC,"I'm a big fan of the original Hellsing (not the manga, the anime).  This more recent version, for some reason deviates substantially about half way through the series.  Or rather, the previous version was very different than the manga and this one is more reflective of the original plot.

Volumes 1 to 8 were good.  But the last two episodes are epic.  Some of the best animation I've ever seen.

One thing I don't really get is the motivation of the Angel of Death character.  He's involved in a decades long plot here but they don't go into enough detail about why.  As a boy, he's linked up with Alucard to destroy the nemesis of the movie who then comes back for revenge like 50 years later.  For some reason, this boy has a major problem with Alucard but there seems to not be any reason for it.  Probably this series needed an extra episode to explain that part but figured, eh, people have read the manga, they get it.",1424131200,,926,4.394117647058824

6509824,5,B00LXGZCBC,Very good end to one of the best animes I've ever seen. I love what they did with most of the characters and they did a wonderful job with how they ended the story. The amount of gore and blood in this anime are extremely over-the-top and you will either love it or hate it. The story is such a departure form the original anime released almost 10 years ago. I personally love the direction it took and it really set this anime apart from everything that came after it.

6509870,3,B00LXGZCBC,"Honestly, this was somewhat disappointing. After years of anticipation, the result had some cheap animation and it managed to create monologues longer than the Major's infamous I Love War speech and far less entertaining, to boot. Everything is explained in ridiculous detail, the pacing is horrible, and the only style is present in the dutifully rendered inkings of Hirano's distinctive panels - otherwise, there's none of the spectacle or charm that made earlier OVAs (3-8 represent the best the series has to offer) so enchanting and enthralling.

Hellsing Ultimate's climax is a confused mess. It lacks emotional impact, many of the fights are too brief and whenever I rewatch this box set, I find myself wanting to skip through segments - something I as a devotee of the series for a long time never imagined would happen.

It commits the worst sin an ending can commit and that is not being as good as what came before. Hellsing somewhere along the line went from fun to tedious, from without reservation to desperately seeking relevance with its audience. It's still worth watching for fans of the series (I find value in it in some places), and it does have good moments - Major's final moments are touching. In fact, I think the showdown between Integra and Major, despite being a glorified staring contest, is the best showdown in the episode - which is both a pro and a con, considering this OVA had the Captain and Seras battle.

Give it a go if you've come this far into Hellsing, but prepare yourself. There's good, but not enough.",1416355200,3,1546,4.804511278195489

6509873,3,B00LXGZCBC,"This review is for the entirety of Hellsing Ultimate (all 10 episodes).
I had seen quite a few scenes from Hellsing Ultimate before I actually watched it, and I wasn't expecting much for story or emotion, but I was expecting a lot of action. There actually ended up being more story and emotion than I figured, and even though there's a couple scenes of characters displaying sorrow that seem drawn out and overacted, I still felt it added to the anime. But what I did not expect was the excessive amount of chibi.
The first half of Hellsing Ultimate isn't really all that great. The story plays out pretty standardly, no big plot twists, with the action amounting to nothing real special. But the big problem is that Hellsing Ultimate seemed to just keep trying to sabotage itself. It just absolutely REFUSED to allow you to feel something. Almost every time things were getting tense, whether it be from an emotional moment or a good action scene, it would kill the mood by either showcasing one of its MANY chibi moments, or someone would just keep rephrasing a line and repeat it over, and over, AND OVER. I don't know if they thought that was supposed to make what they were saying seem more important, but it didn't.
The second half of Hellsing Ultimate is where things get good. The story progresses nicely and turns out to not be as shallow as you were first lead to believe. The action gets ramped up, and we end up seeing a lot of good battles. And the biggest thing of all, Hellsing Ultimate actually allows there to be tension! The chibi moments get cut way back...although, there's still enough of it to annoy you.
As for the final episode, I can't just flat-out say that it's good or bad. It does the most important objective of a finale well by putting an end to a lot of things, and doesn't really leave any cliffhangers. However, it does not give sound answers to explain why things ended the way they did. Instead of giving solid explanations, EVERYONE just kept talking around the answers with philosophical gibberish. I eventually gave up on trying to piece together full-proof reasons and just decided to go along with it. The final episode will also give you one of the biggest WTF moments when an almost solely chibi-based character, with little story behind 'em, is ultimately responsible for the defeat of the biggest badass. Near the end of the final episode, you'll also be given the biggest chibi sequence out of the whole series.
So when it's all said and done, I give Hellsing Ultimate a 3/5. It's entertaining to watch, but nothing really sticks with you, and it amounts to little more than a cheap thrill.
P.S. - I couldn't really find a spot in my review to say this, so I'll say it here  Even though the music for moments throughout Hellsing Ultimate is usually suiting, there are some where the music used just didn't fit at all and makes you wonder what they were thinking when they used it.",1415404800,2,2927,4.58587786259542
6509874,4,B00LXGZCBC,After the long wait we finally have closure to the series (although I wish it would have kept going on...)

6509897,2,B00LXGZCBC,"To preface my review, I am a big Hellsing fan, and I'm ecstatic to finally have he full series.

That said, plainly put, this package had the least to it, yet was the most expensive. Two episodes on one disc. It would have absolutely been worth the extra cost if the prequel OVA were included, however, after the long wait, halfhearted efforts like this come too little, too late, and only stand to encourage piracy.",1414713600,3,416,4.546666666666667
6509898,5,B00LXGZCBC,"I don't really know how to start this...

 Hellsing is an amazing series. What baseline good ideas the original show had, the OVA took and amped it up to an unbelievable masterpiece. Every episode is awe-inspiring and a great segment to watch on its own, of course always gory and perverse. The series shaped up to be one of the most amazing shows I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. With some of the greatest visuals I have ever seen animated. The characters are all so memorable and personable, twisted and dark like humanity at its worst.

I remember getting the original Valentine brothers episode (II) steel book at an FYE years ago. After I finally tracked down all the other steel books years later, I was left at the cliffhanger at episode 4.. I patiently waited for the episodes 5-8 to come out dubbed. Finally, so long after the original 4 were released, the fans were surprised with the announcement of the 5-8 being dubbed and coming out in blue ray/dvd combos. Finally it comes out, we were all impressed by the amazing show, but with the special box set coming out and the way the 8th episode ends, it made us questions if they would pursue the rights for the last two episodes. (and that I honestly did not know we're going to come out at the time!).. Now, right near halloween, I am able to get and watch the last two episodes in english greatness. I have to say, the last two episodes don't disappoint.. I don't want to ruin anything, but Walter sure gets his chance to shine. The thoughts that cross through your head, the investment you pour in the show.. I can not recommend highly enough, all my friends seem to enjoy it. If anyone truly likes what vampires should be, watch Hellsing. You won't regret it.",1414627200,,1731,4.506369426751593
6509899,5,B00LXGZCBC,"This is a review of the Blu-ray edition. Amazon says that it is unrated, but take my word for it, it is R rated because of all the flying body parts and blood. That said, I think that this is the best ending for both this series and for the older TV series.  You need to have watched the previous volumes or else you are going to be lost from the beginning. Volumes 9 & 10 together are about 2 hours long and covers how the previous battle ends.  There are a number of back-stories given and lots of death scenes. Some of the death scenes involve conversations where the person has half their bodies and half their heads blown off, so I guess it's a good thing that a lot of them aren't human.  I particularly liked the extra screen time that Seras Victoria had and one scene where she  pulls out what appears to be a battleship's cannon and pots a bad guy at 30 paces.

There are a number of extras included such as interviews with the voice actors, trailers, and, in case you missed them, replays of the death scenes of the villains. I think that the end music is epic, being played by the Warsaw Philharmonic.

The gore isn't for everyone, but it is an epic end to an epic series. (You did notice that they released it right before Halloween, right?)",1414627200,3,1253,4.265822784810126
6509900,5,B00LXGZCBC,"Years ago, my then-boyfriend (the Michael M listed above) introduced me to Hellsing. I loved it (especially Alucard) but I wished that it had a better ending, as well as a better overall storyline. Someone suggested that I read the manga, and I'm so glad they did - I liked the art better, and the story was, well, much more of a story.

Well, I was SO stoked that they were making Hellsing Ultimate when I found out about it 8 years ago! Unfortunately, due to some drama involving licensing, it has taken FOREVER for it to come out here in the U.S. Thankfully, as of the release of these last two, it's finally complete!

What I love most about Hellsing Ultimate is that it is so very close to the storyline of the Manga. If they did leave anything out or change anything, I didn't notice it. Also, the English dub cast is just about the best ever. I know many people prefer Japanese with subtitles, but I really think that if you want the full effect, you should watch in English.

The art is superb, the characters are intriguing, and while I find that there is often just a little too much monologuing, it's more than made up for by the stellar action and brutal goriness. If you haven't tried Hellsing Ultimate for whatever reason, now is the time! It's finally complete! YAY!",1414627200,2,1281,4.4425531914893615
6509901,5,B00LXGZCBC,"I like most Hellsing fans have been waiting for this for almost three years since it ended in Japan.  As always Hellsing delivers and it just what we want.  I'm only disappointed there aren't more special features.

The special features include a finale interview with some of the voice cast unfortunately not all of them. Commentary for both episodes and a video commentary of Jonathan Klein, Taliesin Jaffe, and Crispin Freeman.
The Dawn however is not there....
I'd hoped that the subbed episodes would at least be released like the first one was with Vol 5-8 but alas it didn't make it.  But hopefully that means it will be dubbed eventually even though it's an unfinished product to begin with because Hirano never finished the manga.

A few not worthy things for the dub
Crispin Freeman is 'Girlycard' -  a few years ago before it was animated the director mentioned how hard it would be to find a voice for Girlycard but he had ideas and was excited.  But then the Japanese version came out and it was still Joji Nakata
Walter now has three voice actors.  Sadly Ralph Lister didn't get to do a lot this time around.  When Young Walter appears it's Liam O'Brian who plays him and then when he's a child or how he appears in the Dawn it's Jessica D. Stone.  My only complaint it you can definitely tell it's a girl.  She did a great job and it was better than trying to get an American boy to fake and English accent but I wish they could have gotten a young British boy to do this but it's really not bad.

If you love Hellsing you'll have stuck around until the end and you will not be disappointed.",1414540800,2,1606,4.425170068027211
6509902,4,B00LXGZCBC,"Unfortunately, the two episodes of ""The Dawn"" are not on this, nor will they be on any further release. However, this is an excellent standalone series; and at the very least, we have the first episode of ""The Dawn"" on the first or second BD of Hellsing Ultimate.

  Anywho, definitely recommend this series to everyone. Perfect ending for a perfect series - and that's all she wrote.

  Well, I should mention that I removed a star due to a few reasons: the lack of ""The Dawn"" episodes (not like that could have been helped anyway), the fact that the last release came with a box set that doesn't fit this last disc, and the lack of extras [no one cares about the English-spoken extras].",1414454400,,688,4.508064516129032
6509903,5,B00LXGZCBC,"My friends, it has a been a long and grueling wait but the wait is nearly over for soon we shall plunge back onto the fields of war! This installment contains the final volumes of Hellsing Ultimate and if you've stuck with this series for this long then you are in a for a treat this Halloween!

Alucard's battle with Father Anderson draws to a close only for Sir Intregra's butler Walter to take center stage for his crack at the King Of Vampires! Why is he fighting him? Who will be victorious? I cannot say except watch and trust me this is a battle you don't want to miss!

The Major meanwhile makes his final play to Intregra and Serias and with everything riding on the line it's sure to be a bloody good time for all!

All I can really say at this point is that you must get it if you were like me and feared our collection of Hellsing Ultimate would be forever incomplete but also if you like vampires and gore as well! (Edward would be slaughtered by Alucard ;) )",1414022400,,972,4.21505376344086
6509904,5,B00LXGZCBC,"My Friends, I like Hellsing. No, friends, I LOVE Hellsing.
I love Alucard, I love Integra, I love Anderson, I love Enrico, I love the Major, I love the Millennium Battalion, and Seras Victoria.
Hellsing in Dub, in Sub, in Abridgements, on YouTube, on DVR, Cosplaying, rewatching I love every act of Hellsing that has occurred upon this Earth.
I love watching Pip and his men destroy vampires on the field of battle, My heart leaps with joy when ever Walter throws his wires high into the air and cuts down ghouls with well placed precision attacks, and there is nothing quite like  watching the Papal Knights of the 9th Crusade destroy the Heathens of London, and the feeling that comes when Alucard unleashes his dog to brutally devour Luke Valentine, was such an exquisite feeling. It moved me deep within my heart to watch Seras drink the blood of a recently dead Pip Bernadotte.
The sight of Anderson stabbing himself with the Nail of Helena was an irresistible pleasure, and their was nothing more arousing than watching Seras fly into a blood rage against the ghouls in the orphanage.
When the troops led by Zorin went ahead to attack the Hellsing Mansion only to be mowed down by thee Wild Geese, I was in ecstasy.
I loved it when The Major gave his epic speech about War, it was so sad to see characters like The Dandy Man and Rip get laid into waste, becoming nothing more than fledglings to the Great Vampire Alucard. I loved it when Zorin cut off Seras' arm and blinded her, the sadness in her voice as she became what she was meant to become.
Gentlemen and Women, all I ask for is Hellsing. Hellsing so grand that will make all other anime pale in comparison, Gentlemen and Ladies, I ask you as fellow brothers and sisters in arms what is it that you really want? Do you want Hellsing to have a grand Finale? A Finale built with blood and regenerators and Nazis? do you ask for a finale to sweep in like a fire, leaving not even critics of the highest order to scavenge from this EARTH?
Very well....then a Finale is what you will have. It will be as a bolt of lightning, ready to strike down ay critics with its glory. But, after years waiting in this war of attrition, a simple, ordinary finale will no longer be sufficient.
WE NEED A MASSIVE FINALE! A FINALE BEYOND OTHER'S IN MAN'S HISTORY HAS EVER KNOWN!
We who stuck it out this long are only fans, the remnants of a massive army numbering more than a million strong, and I believe that each of us old warriors is ready for this kind of finale, for we are not sickly soft Twilight lovers! We represent a fandom that could easily destroy a fandom of a million and one others. It is time for us to awake the ones who abandoned any idea of a dub release of the finale, and who now watch other less worthy finales. Let's drag them out of their delusions by the hair, and remind them of what anime they are dealing with.
We will remind them that vampires do not sparkle, we will remind them of the war these monsters can really wage.
We will remind them that there are better things to watch than can be dreamt of by Hollywood or Disney.
Our Finale of two final episodes will leave all other finales in the dust, yes my friends, soon Hellsing will take its place as a finished Anime in dub.
We have awaited and kept our faith for as long as was needed, now we come to our conclusion, of our beloved HELLSING!
