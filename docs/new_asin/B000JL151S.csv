8151577,3,B000JL151S,I hope Robert Culp enjoyed making it it. It was funning watching him again.,1407888000,,75,4.428571428571429
8151578,1,B000JL151S,it's not worth even a review. Stopped about 1 hour into the movie.,1405900800,,66,4.153846153846154
8151579,5,B000JL151S,"What can you say about a film that makes losers not quite loveable but definitely understandable?  Each of the characters in this film by Eric Fleming are almost good folks, but not quite there.  They are better at telling other people how to pull their lives back together then doing it for themselves.  The ending of the film is to be expected since ""Almost"" people do not have good things happen to them (as we are told repeatedly), but still works for the fact that it is exactly where the characters should land.  Just in passing, it was nice seeing Robert Culp act at being a somewhat stereotypical old man, something he never he was in real life.",1375660800,,653,4.508474576271187
8151580,4,B000JL151S,A very funny movie that had me laughing from start to finish - probably because I am an almost guy myself.,1370995200,,106,4.095238095238095
8151581,3,B000JL151S,"Enjoyable comedy about repo guys getting involved in a kidnapping has a few typical indie-faults; a couple of scenes don't wholly work (especially regarding the initial introduction of and kidnapping of the ballplayer) due likely to a lack of coverage and funds.  Some scenes also are better scripted than others.  Why the film generally works anyway is a spirited cast, and a loose, generous style that allows for easy forgiveness from the audience.  I came at this as a Robert Culp fan, and Culp fans will not be disappointed; he doesn't just have a glorified cameo -- he is indeed the 2nd lead, there from beginning to end, at at age 75 or so looks like he's having a lot of fun in his meatiest role in some time.  He's the best thing in the picture, but he's excellent, so that's not really slighting this uneven but quite likeable film.",1162944000,3,841,4.586666666666667
8151582,5,B000JL151S,"This is a charming romp about lovable losers. After several views, it gets even funnier! Great performances from a wonderful, diverse cast of characters.

I had heard about this movie about two years before I received it on DVD. Robert Culp is one of my favorite actors and he did not disappoint. He's the master of stage business and posseses about a million facial expressions, which he always uses to maximize a character.

Shawnee Smith lends her unique style to a wonderful mix.

Don't miss the short films by Eric Flemming and Andrea Michaud that are included on the DVD; their humor is worth of Abrahams/Zucker/Abrahams.

Long live the Independent film-makers! Esp. when they produce such wonderful entertainment.",1161907200,,720,5.076271186440678
