615726,5,630327417X,"Endless Summer, like it's title, means something very personal to each person who loves this film.  Like its magical studio cousin, Gidget, it is deceptively simple, almost amateurish by today's standards. Two boyish surfers follow the sun and summer around the world, surfing exotic shores, mixing with locals. Bruce Brown overdubs with a sweet voice and just-this-side-of-corny narration set to his competent 16mm photography.  But, like many masterpieces, it is larger than the sum of its parts---much larger.  From the now famous poster image of silhouetted surfers against the backdrop of the beach's infinite horizon to the plain and lilting surf guitar of the theme music, Endless Summer has become not only an evocation of surfing's enchanting allure, but a cultural touchstone of the 60's as well and, for a couple of generations since, the sweet memory of youth itself---endless, adventurous and warm.",902880000,5,911,5.356643356643357

615946,5,630327417X,"Even after 50 years The Endless Summer remains an eminently watchable film.  Part of that comes from the careful and expert photography by film maker Bruce Brown.  The ocean certainly presents a never ending series of lyrically lovely scenes to film and Brown films them with a casual awe that we like.  Part of the charm of the film comes from the personalities of the two young surfers (the dudes were about 21 at the time).  They come across as very nice young men, not worldly in the least, guys that know they are doing something very special and that seem grateful for the chance to do what they are doing.  Part of what we like is the running commentary done by Brown himself.  He is pretty funny in a very low key way.
  And how cool is it to see a long series of surfing firsts?  The guys are the first to surf in Senegal, the first surfers to introduce the sport to Nigeria and of course most famously the first to ride the amazing perfect waves at Cape St. Frances in South Africa.  Unknown at the time, Cape St. Francis now is the home of a thriving tourist infrastructure.  Now, thanks to the publicity engendered by Brown's movie, any of us can fly to South Africa and try our hand at riding the best waves in the world.  Not the biggest waves, but the most perfectly formed, consistent waves with a very long run time.  Super.
  I like the 50 year old snap shot of culture as well.  The boys wear suits when they fly from place to place.  They are a little shocked (and delighted) at the swim suits common on Australian girls (quite different from American styles at the time).  Some of the banter does seem out dated-Brown references Africans as Natives, something we no longer say.  But the whole thing shows a difficult sport in a good light, clean limbed young people enjoying themselves doing something that I could not manage to do even when I was their age.",1479340800,,1879,4.409883720930233

Decades have gone by and cinematic masterpieces have been produced about surfing the waves of the world; not even a digital remastering of Endless Summer could elevate it to competition level with latter surfing movies. The commentaries and humor of the narrator are not the best for the occasion, the photography, in most cases, leaves a lot to be desired and many of the beaches presented are not the best of the best.

616364,3,630327417X,"I was looking for a beach movie to watch upon returning from vacation. I chose to watch The Endless Summer based off of the positive reviews on IMBD and because at the time of viewing it was free to watch on Amazon Prime.

As the title and cover art suggests, this film is about two surfers seeking out an endless summer by traveling around the world and looking for good places to surf. The style of the film is a light, narrated documentary with an original music score. Given the technology used at the time this was made, the visuals are nice.

Watching this in 2015 serves as a bit of a time capsule as you see the men dressed up to go on airplanes, balk over prices that sound low and hear a bit of commentary in the narration that isn't politically correct by today's standards.

The highlights for me were the African fishing village (I loved how quickly the people there took to the sport), the nod to Lawrence of Arabia, the riding of surfboards down the sand dunes and the brief encounters with wild animals. I also liked that they included information regarding the water temperature of various locations.

It was enjoyable to see the skill, pioneering spirit and passion of not only the two main characters, but the other people they came across on their journeys. As in any sports documentary, there is more to this movie than the sport itself, however, it is the primary focus and I feel that this movie would be more enjoyable to a person that is more interested in the sport of surfing.",1436659200,,1503,4.4945054945054945

Perhaps having summer break from school made summer more desirable.  But you get my point.  Also as a boy, the movie left believing that the seasons moved east-west, not north south.

The concept of following the summer around the world worked for the film, and they surfed places no one had surfed before---proving surfing could be an international sport. More over, they showed it to be a fun sport.
  The humor and travel could not be done today, given the state of the world, politics, and society, BUT the fun and the surf are still relevant. Indeed, although it has been almost 50 years since I first saw the movie, scenes like surfing the ""ins and outs"" in Tahiti still make me smile. Truly a classic, and if you've ever surfed, a worthy addition to your library.
  I would suggest it in conjunction with Step into Liquid, a recent surf moving, to see that old guys still surf, but the boards are smaller and the waves larger!",1413331200,,923,4.343023255813954

It still retains the innocence of the period even though, the narrator sometimes betrays an all knowing smile. Recent swells in So-Cal got me curious about the surf phenomenom, which has  become a huge sport and culture. The footage of waves and girls,  like the boards,  is retro as you would expect, but like many good surf documentaries, the ocean takes center frame, and though these two are not shredding 60+ ft waves, the raw power of Neptune is on display in every locale they visit. Recommend starting with this one,  and then updating the experience with ""Step into Liquid"", ""Riding Giants"", and A Deeper Shade of Blue"" ( among others).",1410307200,5,868,4.616883116883117

616950,5,630327417X,"I echo the sentiments of an earlier reviewer, in that while I also don't even surf, this is one of my favorite documentaries. The combination of naive homeliness, great scenery, corny narration and fantastic music really pulls off an unlikely miracle. I found out about this movie watching the Monterey Pop Festival set - it had been an important part of that whole scene - and I'm glad I checked it out.

Possibly the true originator of the surf movie, Bruce Brown in this film showed what a DIY filmmaker out to create his own genre could do. While the narration is hokey, the shots are achingly, stunningly beautiful. They chronicle a world long, long gone, making this a matter of historical record and immensely valuable, even if it's full of their nutty viewpoints.

The film starts off slow, showing plenty of background on what the beach scene was like in those days. ""Only a handful of surfers ride these big waves. Half of them are sportsmen, the rest are nuts."" Two of our surfers go off for a trip around the world, and they start off in Africa. Despite being good boys, they let their views be known on their visit to Senegal, when they note that ""being good Africans, they threw rocks [in greeting]"". Dubious. Still, it's interesting to see how our little California boys get around. They engage a village chief, who is not a natural surfer, but somehow someone gets it going. They note the primitive village, the expensive hotel, the difficulty of getting a surfboard into an African taxi, and the jungle. ""Most of these people had never seen a white man before."" When in Ghana, the went to Agip gas station and get ripped off (a gip - <em>ha ha ha</em>!!!), ""people came to the beach with their lunch and the kids and still had two hands free."" RIOT!!!

They note that the temperature of the water in Nigeria was the same as the air - 91 degrees fahrenheit (32 degrees celsius - they make the same point in Endless Summer 2 when they are in Costa Rico); no way to cool off even, in the water, if it's that hot. There's also plenty of death in the seas - ""step on a stone fish, you die in 15 minutes."" And there's all the corny jokes - like the ""Terrence of Africa"", with Lawrence Of Arabia imagery and music. Ha ha. The boys surf down a few sand dunes, which looked like a lot of fun, before finding a new surf spot of their own in the middle of Africa. They went to New Zealand in 1965, when there were 2 million people in the whole country... and 10 million sheep. Bruce shows some amazing waves that can let a surfer just go on forever, apparently - we only see the last short part of rides that went on and on for 15 minutes!! And in Tahiti they could take waves out as well as back in again. ""There are no waves in Tahiti."" Bonus features: Interviews with Bruce Brown and the guys who were in Endless Summer. Talking about how the film made surfing legitimate for 40 minutes, self-congratulatory but with some new good music, as well as many repeated scenes.

Yes, that's right - the music is just great, and so is the cover graphic of three people posing with their boards! Everything about this film is wonderful, except maybe the languid pace, and some of the corny jokes. But you really get a sense of innocence from surfers who never smoke or drank, and who had short hair and no ink, just the months of golden sunshine permanently tattooed onto the bodies. Nice.",1370044800,,3389,4.443729903536977

616953,5,630327417X,"It's hard for me to see The Endless Summer as a movie. It's more like an old friend, one you can always trust to have a good time with, no matter the time or setting. It's one of the most simple and entertaining films I've ever come across, full of endless (yeah, sorry) joys and pleasures. All from an amateur director, 2 surfers, and a $50,000 budget.

The plot, while not very important, follows surfers Bruce Brown (director, writer, and narrator of the film), Mike Hynson, and Robert August as they travel around the world in search of ""the perfect wave"". Key spots include Hawaii, California, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Tahiti. The title derives from the idea of following the summer around the world.

It should be noted that knowledge of surfing is NOT required to enjoy this film (I, for example, knew nothing about the sport). This aspect is Bruce Brown's greatest achievement. The film is incredible in it accessibility. Brown narrates, and from the get-go, he is welcoming, light-hearted, and occasionally quite funny. The soundtrack for the movie is provided by The Sandals, and their music, including the film's now iconic theme song, sets the perfect mood. It also doesn't hurt that the sport of surfing is hypnotic and very fun to watch, especially with the great talents Brown is able to capture (Butch Van Artsdalen and Miki Dora are definite highlights). The film is beautifully shot, usually from the shore, but every once in a while from the surfboard itself.

I hesitate to call The Endless Summer a ""great"" documentary in the same class as Crumb, For All Mankind, Gimme Shelter, Dear Zachary, or the films of Allan King. It's kinda one-note, probably runs a good 15 minutes too long, and isn't exactly deep. But then again, it doesn't really have to be. What Bruce Brown exceeds at is capturing a mood and sense of fun. When Mike or Robert pull off a great ride, teach a few natives how to surf (in one of the film's most hilarious, though not exactly politically correct scenes), and of course, finally find that perfect wave in Southern Africa, you're just as excited as they are. No, The Endless Summer is not profound or thought-provoking cinema, but one aspect of it is undeniable: It's fun. Sometimes that's more than enough.",1365120000,4,2263,4.782608695652174

In Hawaii, surfing was kind of like football in Texas.  It was the primary sporting attraction.  This spunky documentary begins there where Bruce Brown and a couple of his surfing buddies decided to travel the globe search for waves in both hemispheres' summer season.

After Hawaii and California, the boys head for the west coast of Africa where surfing was unheard of.  Hell, I think even white people were unheard of in some of these places.

If you love surfing, and are into the history of the culture this film shows an early peek into it's origins. Shot just at the beginning of the post Gidget migration to the beach and subsequent surf culture boom of the 60's. It shows two surfers, traveling and surfing, on the equipment of the day, surfing techniques of the day etc. It shows what life and travel were like in the era. What is it NOT however is dated. I have seen this film many times and watching the remastered version is for one, clearer than the old worn out VHS copy I've seen! And it is still fresh, Bruce Brown's film is still as relevant today as ever, and sets a standard for surf films. It is not nostalgic, not dusty and there are no moments that you have to squint to get through. It is a look back at a time that while the beaches were getting crowded and things were about to blow up with phony surf culture and Hollywood influence, if one was lucky enough to have been there at the time, I am sure compared to today, ""those were the days"". And this film is a timepiece that allows a brief respite into the past that still shapes the future.",1332979200,,1199,4.194805194805195

I have to say th@ the first time i veiwed this film, i thought it was kinda silly, but upon watching it the second time i was hooked.
The beauty of the water and waves and those awesome surfers just wantin to CATCH A WAVE for as long in one year as they could, so by traveling to places all around the globe one year they were able to do so. I like this film and hope you do or will too.

The voice reminds me of Warren Miller, that maker of ski movies, who, like Bruce Brown the maker of this movie, hails from, where else?  California.  But remember, this film was originally made in the 1960s.  Things were much different back then.  For one, surfers mostly got along.  Not so anymore.

This film, originally a big screen classic, has now been adapted to video and CD.  If you aren't a surfer, you may find the surfing scenes interesting.  If you are a surfer, you will find them interesting.  And there are some good wildlife shots from Africa, if I am to remember correctly.

What's significant about this movie is that it was filmed SO LONG ago that surfers actually choose a surfspot by following the movement of the rest of the pack (as in the case of the South Africans).  Today, people choose surfspots by going where no man has gone before.  These days, if crowds can be avoided at any cost, they are.

4 Stars.  Cheesy narration, but everything was cheesy back then.  If you don't believe me, just watch Robert Mitchum, Gregory Peck, or John Wayne.",1316304000,,1204,4.711538461538462

617209,1,630327417X,"As a young surfer in the mid sixties, I saw The Endless Summer, at least a dozen times in the theater. When it finally came out on VHS tape, I immediately got a copy. When originally released on DVD, it seemed greatly enhanced compared to tape. Now with this ""Re-Mastered-Director's Special Edition"" I can honestly say, that if you already have it on DVD, don't bother with this version. The first thing I watched was the second disc, with the special features. This was a joke! There was video of Bruce Brown, sitting in a chair, in front of his house, repeating the same old stories, that he's told for years, about the filming of The Endless Summer. There was nothing new there. The whole time, Bruce was looking off camera, looking somewhat bored and rambling on, with a series of disjointed clips from The Endless Summer, The Endless Summer II, and his son Dana's movie Step into Liquid. The video quality was horrible and worse was the totally inappropriate quasi contemporary music, which didn't fit any of the scenes and made this hard to watch. The rest of the ""special features"" were pretty much a waste of time.

The main disc, which features the movie The Endless Summer, just didn't seem to be what I expected for being ""remastered"". I thought the video quality of the original DVD version to be better. If you haven't seen The Endless Summer, judging it by the time period it was created in, it was a great, culturally iconic film. It's a lot of fun to watch and to listen to Bruce's warm and humorous narration. I would recommend this film and the purchase of the original DVD but don't waste money on this new ""re-mastered"" version.

I can't imagine Bruce Brown being happy with this release, unless he's thinking of still bringing in income from this 40+ year old film.",1302048000,23,1786,4.613207547169812

617270,4,630327417X,"In the late 1950's and early 1960's, surfer and filmmaker Bruce Brown built a small career making short surfing films and showing them in school auditoriums with his own live narration.  In 1964, he shot his first documentary feature, THE ENDLESS SUMMER.  Released in 1966, the film would become an enduring, entertaining milestone, celebrating surf culture and the search for the perfect wave.

The primary subjects of Brown's movie are Mike Hynson and Robert August, two Southern California surfers who embark on an odyssey to find the world's greatest surfing spots.  Brown and his silent 16mm camera accompanied the pair as they chased the surf to Senegal, Ghana, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti and Hawaii.  Though the film focuses on Mike and Robert's surfing adventures, it also became a travelogue of these two guileless, young Americans (3, including Brown), surfboards in tow, discovering remote parts of the 1960's world while happily encountering the locals.

Brown intercut Mike and Robert's journey with footage of some of the best surfers and surf locations in California and Hawaii.  His love of the sport and the culture make THE ENDLESS SUMMER infectious viewing, even for landlubbers like me.

Shooting his movie with the most basic 16mm equipment, Bruce Brown's keen eye is responsible for turning THE ENDLESS SUMMER into the landmark documentary it became.  Additionally, Brown's fun, involving narration is completely engaging.  In the best sense, it's like watching a good pal's home movies, where your host's enthusiasm and love of his subject becomes infectious, while the wall-to-wall, surf-inflected music of The Sandals brings it all home.

Forty-five years after Bruce Brown shot his film, THE ENDLESS SUMMER has become an endearing time capsule of an era long past.  Thanks to the Top 40 popularity of The Beach Boys and their musical mythologizing of the California beach ethos, catching a wave was a concept that became familiar around the world.  Brown beautifully captured that spirit on film in THE ENDLESS SUMMER.",1296000000,4,2062,5.25

They were the un-Hollywood treatment for which surfers wanting a movie about their sport had been longing, true surfing films that won their approval, hands down. But they also entertained non-surfers, letting everybody in on the fun without alienating anybody.

As beautiful as the scenery and surfing footage are, it is actually the narration that sold me on ""The Endless Summer"" years ago. While Bruce Brown explains the terminology used by surfers, the narration isn't loaded to the gills with it, as though addressing surfers only. In short, everybody can understand what he was talking about and enjoy it. The intensity is genuine, and the humor is really, really funny.

The film is entirely narrated by Bruce Brown, who is seen in a few short clips of surfers. The soundtrack of surf music is one of the highpoints. The film ignores surfing in S. America, the Carribean, the Mediterranean and much of the southern Pacific. We never find out who financed their global excursion, nor anything else about them at all.

617457,3,630327417X,"Bruce Brown's 'The Endless Summer' (1964) was his first nationally distributed surf film, and also the first on which he spent more than six months filming and editing. After a slightly shaky start, 'The Endless Summer,' which features a haunting instrumental theme by the Sandals, eventually became a worldwide hit both critically and commercially, and is recognized today as a classic sports documentary.

However, 'The Endless Summer' isn't necessarily better than Brown's excellent, if more amateurish, first five surf films ('Slippery When Wet,' 1958, 'Surf Crazy,' 1959, 'Barefoot Adventure,' 1960, 'Surfing Hollow Days,' 1961, and the compilation film, 'Waterlogged,' 1962), which have only recently found wide distribution via 'The Bruce Brown Golden Years Of Surf Collection 1958-1963.'

In fact, Brown's earlier efforts are in many ways somewhat better. Though 'The Endless Summer' is more professionally filmed, more tightly framed by the quest alluded to in its title, and somewhat more polished and 'dignified,' it also has some faults the earlier, more exuberant films lack.

The most pronounced of these are the scenes filmed in Accra, Ghana, where Brown's narration as the surfers interact with the African natives often comes across as smarmy and awkward at best, even for those thankfully politically incorrect times.

Brown was used to publicly poking good-hearted fun at his surfing buddies, but he intermittently falls on his face when applying the same Westernized cultural formula to pass judgment on a people ""who had probably never seen a white man before."" Suggesting that the Ghanese fishermen might be cannibals, for example, was both too obvious a bad joke and simply in poor taste (though Brown reports that many viewers have told him that the Ghana scenes are among the film's most memorable).

Additionally, the scenes filmed in equatorial Africa simply aren't very interesting, having, as they do, less to do with actual surfing and more to do with the group's understandable culture shock at their immediate immersion in an utterly strange civilization. Brown should be commended for the honesty of his approach and observations; nonetheless, it's unfortunate his narration on this segment wasn't somewhat more sophisticated.

Once Brown and fellow surfers Robert August and Mike Hyson reach Cape Town to rendezvous with notable local surfer John Whitmore, the film brightens considerably, presumably because Brown, or the entire trio, was back on more comfortable footing. The portion of the film set in South Africa, culminating of the trio's discovery of Cape St. Francis and its ""long, utterly perfect waves,"" is the highpoint of 'The Endless Summer.'

Tall, dark-haired Robert August was the affable, 18-year old son of well-known surfer Blackie August, and had already worked extensively with Brown in earlier films.

Why Brown specifically selected Mike Hynson remains a mystery, though the shorter, blond Hynson certainly made a strong visual contrast to August. There's something slightly off-putting about Hynson, who would go on to have a troubled life but also become a respected board shaper. Presumably, sunnier personalities Brown had used in the past, such as Henry Ford, Kemp Aaberg, or Mike Diffenderfer (or the poker-faced Del Cannon) were unavailable for the extended travel necessary to make the film (scenes of Cannon establishing a record by becoming the first person to surf Japanese coastal waters were filmed for 'The Endless Summer,' but eventually edited out).

'The Endless Summer' additionally takes its audience to Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, and, briefly, to California and Hawaii. Among the well-known surfers briefly seen are Miki Dora, Nat Young, Phil Edwards, Greg Noll, Corky Carroll, and Butch Van Artsdalen.

Thirty years later, Brown apparently came out of filmmaking retirement to make 'The Endless Summer II' (1994), which features Pat O'Connell and Robert ""Wingnut"" Weaver on a similar trip in search of the perfect wave while chasing the shifting summer around the globe.

While fairly spirited and clearly well intentioned, 'The Endless Summer II' is, like Philip Boston's 'Billabong Odyssey' (2003) and Dana Brown's 'Step Into Liquid' (2003), but unlike Stacy Peralta's 'Riding Giants' (2004), too slick and soulless for its own good, and lacks most of the simple charm and vision that made Brown's earlier films so immediate, warm, and three-dimensional. Paradoxically, rarely do technological advances in photography make for better or more evocative surfing documentaries.

The Endless Summer Collection is rounded out with the interesting 'The Endless Summer Revisited' (2000), which features abundant footage of Brown, his son, Dana Brown, Greg Noll, Robert August, Dale Velzy, Nat Young, Hobie Alter, Pat O'Connell, Wingnut Weaver, and other legends of the sport discussing the creation of the films and their impact upon surfing as well as on the larger world.",1245283200,7,4951,5.449086161879896

The film gives you a good feel for the '60s surf scene with the lingo (""stoked, hang ten, etc."")

The surging can get boring after awhile but Bruce Brown, who made this film and narrates it, usually didn't overdo those parts and he does an outstanding job narrating to keep us non-surfers interested. He's a funny guy!

617465,3,630327417X,"I suspect everybody has certain movies that became almost mythic for them, even though they never quite got around to seeing them.  ENDLESS SUMMER was such a film for me.  It debuted in 1966 when I was in junior high school, and, like the BEACH PARTY movies and the motorcycle flicks of the era, it was a film I wanted desperately to see, but one I was just a few years too young for.  ""Youth culture"" was a very ill-defined term at the time, but anything that seemed to smack of freedom from familial and  societal restraints, i.e. just bumming around, was inherently intriguing to me.  Unfortunately, my mom and dad didn't always agree.

Within a few years, surf culture probably started seeming relatively wholesome compared to the more illicit activities that were starting to gain a foothold in the culture.  But even as a young teen, I was vaguely aware that there was sort of a Beatnik underside to the surfing scene.  Sure the Gidgets of the world would grow up, and Frankie and Annette would settle down in the suburbs.  But there were also those guys you'd hear about, like the two dudes in this movie, who were doing wild things like traveling the world searching for the perfect wave in ""an endless summer.""  There was something Romantically ""Kerouac-ian"" about people like that.

Or so it seemed 'til I finally saw the movie. For years I had labored under the impression that the two guys at the heart of this documentary were the hardcore, near-beatnik beachbums who would spend their entire lives on this kind of quest.  Turn out they were a couple of average Joes (or given their surfer dude status, maybe I should say ""average Chads"") who probably jumped at the chance to make this doc and  travel around the world for one GLOBAL summer (but hardly an ""endless one"") before heading to business school or wherever their real life career paths would lead them.

Still, the cinematography--while perhaps a bit primitive by today's standards--is good enough to suggest something of the thrill of the sport, and there are plenty of scenes that give the viewer a feel for the Zeitgeist.  But it's still pretty much a conventional documentary, with a ""youthful orientation"" that hasn't aged all that well.  And, yes, some of the non-PC commentary about native tribesmen and customs in the various locales IS grating, even if it's more or less understandable given the era.  Gripes about $30.00 a night hotel rooms and $1.00 cups of coffee (and--EGAD-- $1.00 per gallon GAS!!) are bound to give contemporary viewers a chuckle or two.

Worth a look-see, but this viewer was somewhat disappointed to find out after all these years that ""The Endless Summer"" was really more like ""a protracted spring break.""

617645,4,630327417X,"This is a fascinating collection of films that span several decades. Of course, this is a must-see for anyone interested in surfing. However, it also has value to people who might never set foot on a board.

Endless Summer I was filmed in the early 60s, when most of the world was unaware of surfing. Two young surfers set out on a bold journey around the world to find new places to surf. Much of the entertainment in this film comes from the different cultures and characters they meet around the world. One of my favorites was an intriguing experience with an African village. This film is considered a classic documentary in the surfing world, and it probably had a lot to do with the spread of surfing around the world.

Endless Summer II was filmed almost 30 years after the first one, but it was filmed by the same man and includes one of the original surfers from the first film. Modern advances in surfing and filming are quite evident after watching the two films together. ESII has some dramatic surfing video, including remarkable footage from some of today's most famous surfers. Two new young surfers follow a similar path to ESI, including visits to some of the same places along with new places (e.g., Costa Rica). As with ESI, the film is as much about the characters and cultures as the surfing.

The third part of The Endless Summer Collection is a nice follow-up to the first two documentaries. You get a lot of behind the scenes stories about the films and how they came to be. If you enjoyed the Endless Summer films, you will be interested to see what has happened to some of the characters and to learn more about the story behind the films.

I don't know how you can watch this collection without wanting to go out to the beach and get on a board!",1186963200,10,1772,4.4937888198757765

617647,5,630327417X,"A joyous movie. This is a documentary made in the mid 60's following two surfer's as they decide to travel the world chasing the perfect wave and surf an endless summer.

The innocense of the era is breathtaking. The pair fly to Africa and begin their journey. They obviously had a very open itinerary and their openess leads to many unexpected surprises. I especially liked their surfing in the fishing village, and their willingness to share their talent with everyone there.

Sure there is a lot of corny humor, and some marginal non-pc moments, but none of it is mean and in the context of the 60's very innocent. For the 60's the cinematography is exceptional. I also liked the two main characters. They are very clean cut. It's interesting to note how special air travel was in those days. The two surfers are wearing suits on the plane! That's what you did in those days, you got dressed up to fly on a plane.

After 15 minutes you realize that you are not watching a surfing documentary, but are watching a movie about pursuing your dream without abandon that happens to have surfing in it. It's the journey that's the focus of the movie, not really the surfing. The joy of finding the unexpected, of being open to new things, and having fun. The message that it's the journey is not bludgeoned into your head either. Bruce Brown subtly weaves it into the tapestry of almost non-stop surfing footage, especially Cape St. Francis.

Some people will say that I am waxing way too poetically about this, after all it's surfing right? But I say it really isn't. We don't have enough Cape St. Francis's in our lives, but being open to it, is what it's all about, isn't it? The last line of the movie sums it up. ""With enough time and enough money you could spend the rest of your life following the summer around the world, but for now the enless summer must end."" Of course the endless summer does end, but maybe this will inspire you to ""catch that perfect wave"". I challenge anyone to watch this movie and not feel uplifted.",1186099200,2,2029,4.53551912568306

I decided to update my review because sometimes the things that we once considered ""classic"" may or may not be still relevant. I still consider this 1966 movie to be a classic. Not just a classic surfing movie...not just a classic documentary...a classic on every level. it almost makes me believe that even now, there are two kids circling the globe searching for the Endless Summer. Apparently, that's not the case. I heard that one of the stars of this movie kind of went off the deep end.

Too bad.

Too bad he didn't ""see"" the film he was a part of. Too bad he still isn't grateful and appreciative of the fact that, in many ways, he helped to change the culture of the planet. Too bad that he didn't think that this movie would inspire so many people regardless of whether or not they were surfers.

This movie that documents the ""surfing lifestyle"" will blow you away. Not from flash or from over dramatization, but from an inner knowing that you, too, belong to this crazy-beautiful world. Astronauts looking at the planet from space called it the ""little blue gem in the sky"". And yet we treat this place like a garbage dump. Maybe how we treat the planet is simply a reflection of how we are treating ourselves and each other.

We need to behold the beauty that is before us now and know that this is the accepted time to change, transform, and realize that on a round planet there can be no sides.

617833,4,630327417X,"The Endless Summer is a legendary surfing film I always wanted to see but didn't get around to seeing until recently. With my background, it may seem kind of odd. I grew up in San Diego, was an avid bodysurfer and a sometimey board surfer and had ample opportunity to see this film when I was a young teen. I don't recall how long this was featured at the Fine Arts Theater in Pacific Beach, but it seems like it was showing there forever. Most of my school friends saw it, but somehow for me I always had something else to do.

Last night, I watched for the first time. I actually expected something different, like a lot more surfing and a lot more huge surf. What I saw is actually kind of a cutesy, sometimes cheesy, very mid-sixties travelogue with surfing as its focus. That's not to say that The Endless Summer is not enjoyable. It does have its moments, but many of those revolve around the filmed interludes in Hawaii and at the Wedge rather than the globe-trotting surfing adventures of Mike and Bob.

My favorite scenes were in Ghana, where the locals took an active interest in what Mike and Bob were doing, in South Africa where the gorgeous scenery coupled with the seemingly limitless and uncrowded beaches make the viewer fantasize about a surf vacation there, and the scenery and surf of New Zealand. What drops a star from a film that is supposed to be about two guys chasing waves and the summer season worldwide is where they didn't go. No Indonesia or mainland Asia, and no South America. Why not?

Above all, this film is a paean to youth, freedom, and wanderlust. I am amazed that some of the people who picked Mike and Bob up while they were hitch-hiking to their next destination decided to just join them for awhile and ultimately drive them to where they were going. At today's gas prices, the prospect makes one shudder.

If you are one with the ocean in your blood, then you will find a world of vicarious thrills when you see The Endless Summer. It may even inspire you to launch a personal quest to surf the best beaches in the world. Things have changed a lot since this was filmed and you may find that once deserted beaches are now teeming with surfers. At any rate, it has surely inspired me to go hit the waves again on my next trip to California.",1124755200,,2283,4.428571428571429

617838,5,630327417X,"Way back in 1966, documentary filmmaker Bruce Brown followed two young surfers around the world in their quest for the perfect wave.  It seems as if it were just the three of them - the two surfers and Bruce Brown who filmed that magical year with a hand-held Technicolor camera with no sound.  Later, he edited the film and narrated it and his is the only voice we hear in addition to some original music by ""The Sandals"". There are no sounds of the surf, no remarks from the two surfers and we never hear the voices of all the colorful characters they meet along the way.

The concept was to surf on beaches that had never been surfed before.  This led them Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Tahiti. And, naturally California and Hawaii. Sometimes the surf was to their liking.  Sometimes it was not.  But always it was an adventure, the kind of adventure that I quickly got caught up in even though it all seemed like a home movie and the camera was old fashioned.  I remember one spot where there is a long smooth wave to ride and the narrator notes that the wave was so long that he ran out of film, stopped shooting, changed the film, and was able to continue filming the surfer on the same wave.

As the film was made in 1966, it expressed a view of the world that is not politically correct today.  For example, there are a lot of little jokes about the ""natives"" in an African tribe.  But in spite of the words, it was obvious that everyone in the tribe enjoyed watching the surfers.  Later, with the help of our surfers, these ""natives"" tried it themselves and soon were improvising their own surfboards.

There are a lot of beaches in the world.  But the sport was perfected in Hawaii as pure recreation.  That's the way the Hawaiians lived for centuries.  Our two surfers came from California, a place very much influenced by Hawaiian surfers.

Other details about 1966 stood out and made me smile.  For example, a luxury hotel in Senegal cost $30 per night, which they thought was outlandishly expensive.  Gas cost $1.00 a gallon in Africa, a very high cost.  And the hairstyles of the two light-haired and sometimes sunburned surfers were short and slicked back with lots and lots of grease. Also, the bodies of the surfers did not look like the surfers today.  The two men had narrow chests and the musculature in their arms and legs was just enough to handle their surfboards.  Obviously, they never worked out in a gym.  They just rode those waves.  And loved every minute of it.

This is a film that was made with the pure love of the sport.  It is indeed a classic.  And a  ""must"" for anyone interested surfing.",1087516800,43,2631,4.472689075630252

Shot as a documentary by Bruce Brown, it follows two surfers as they trek around the world, looking for the perfect wave. Do they find it? Contrary to our love of the ambiguous ending, yes, they do find it, down in South Africa on a beach where the wave starts at the tip and seems to go on and on and on, following the coast long enough that you think, by the time the surfers beach themselves, they'll probably need a taxi or a train to take them back to their point of origin.

The movie follows a couple of surfers as they chase waves around the world in the burgeoning 'surf safari' culture that developed in the 1950s and 60s. This film led a whole new brand of adventurous surfers out to surf the world's remote places, to find their own little paradise, and of course, surfers still do.
It's charm is its innocence, and beauty, the thrill of searching wild places for the first time, and seeing different lands and cultures in the relatively innocent late 1950s and 60s.
Modern surfers will note such places now more well-known for their surfing in: SW Australia, Bells Beach (Victoria), Sydney, Cape St Francis (South Africa-there is an intersting side story here-see below), Raglan (New Zealand), Tahiti, and places still relatively unknown fo surfing: eg west Africa.
Their visit to Cape St Francis has an interesting side-story here. They were the first to surf it, thinking they had found a really fantastic and remote point break, when in fact an even better wave (one of the world's very best, if indeed not the best- outside perhaps Grajagan in Java, as most surfers think), was just around the corner at Jeffreys Bay. (I have surfed both J-Bay and Cape St Francis, and it is amazing that these two waves are so close to each other, and yet that they went half way round the world and unfortunately missed the far better one).
Innocent and full of charm and 60s-style rebellion, it is one for the collection, and to reminisce on times gone by. For the keen surfer it is definitely worth a look, especially if you plan to go on surfari-the spirit of adventure never changes.
The sequel (1994) is not rated as highly by some, but it has some good updated surf culture and surf spots such as: Tavarua, Grajagan, Burleigh, Elands Bay, Namibia, J bay (of course), Central America, and even Alaska (for the novelty, not the surf-even though Sitka has a spot rated highly-but very hard to get to-and very cold).
The 'endless summer' will continue, even after the surfers are gone.",1019088000,5,2327,4.71990171990172

618002,5,630327417X,"As a So Cal native stuck for a time in DC, my recent purchase of the DVD version of Bruce Brown's 1964 work of art  (i wore out the VHS) was like a breath of fresh air.  The first (and one of the only) to really tell the story of surfing like it is, Brown captures waves that most of us can only dream of, while going to places no one had ever surfed before with a couple of eager 18 year old Californians and still gives a powerful yet light commentary on the beauty of the native cultures they visited.  Anyone who sees this film cannot help but be drawn to the majesty and humbling thrill of the ocean and boardriding.  True to their Dana Point, CA, roots, Brown--along with star Robert August--still today surf their local breaks.  Mike Hynson and August were truly the luckiest guys of their time, able to live the dream of searching for the perfect wave all over the world.  Shot with sincerity, passion, and innocence, Brown, August, Hynson, Greg Noll, and all the other guys and girls show the greatness of surfing in that era, along with an appreciation for the ocean and its culture.  Anyone from a land-locked inlander to a geezer to a pro can't help but feel good after watching it.  Add to that the original tunes of the Sandals and some funky tribal beats with Brown's honest, funny commentary and Mike and Robert's light-hearted fun, and you've got one of the reasons why surfing is so popular today.  So do they find that perfect wave?  You'll just have to watch it and see.  Then get up and go surfing!",998006400,,1519,4.389285714285714
618003,5,630327417X,"This classic surfing documentary retains its charm, high quality, humor and nostalgia. Bruce Brown's 1966 Endless Summer was one of the first and remains one of the best documentaries on surfing. It's a laid-back almost relaxing documentary to watch which occassionally features some awesome displays of surfing pioneers hanging ten on perfect, imperfect and very dangerous waves.  Tubes, Pipes, perfect waves, surfing towards, and away from the shore, ridin' the wave, wipe out. . . it's all here.
 This was a low budget affair, but the camera-work and richness of color is quite impressive. Most of the footage was shot silent with sound-effects and narration and occassional music added later. Don't expect to hear the Beach Boys, or the Ventures or even Dick Dale on the soundtrack--you won't. You won't get MTV fast edits, or occassional messages about pollution, over-population, or politics either.
That's refreshing.
Most refreshing of all is that you won't see a lot of ads for sneakers or cars, or sporting goods plastered all over the surfboards or cars of the surfers either.  It was a less chaotic, simpler time.
The movie follows two young surfers Robert August and Mike Hynson as they follow Summer around the world. First after leaving their native California and the crowded beaches of Malibu, Santa Cruz and Newport Beach (the Wedge) they travel to Africa and surf places probably no one has ever surfed before (and have to be careful not to step on dangerous and lethal stone fish). The natives are fascinated by the California surfers and their sport. Soon Robert and Mike are giving surf lessons to the natives. They hitch a ride with an African Game Hunter and travel along the coast with a perfect tour guide. They find the perfect wave. In Australia, Mike and Robert don't have good luck and are told the best time to surf in Australia isn't in the Summer (which is the U.S.'s late fall, early winter), but in the winter. They have a little better luck in New Zealand, and as they go off to Tahiti  they are told there is very little to surf in Tahiti. Ah but there turns out to be plenty to surf in Tahiti. Then Mike and Robert are off to Hawaii for two months where water and air temperatures are 75 degrees.
While there will be a few folks who will find Bruce Brown's narration (Bruce an early surfing enthusiast wrote, directed, photographed, edited and narrated this film) annoying, most will  find his disarming, tongue in cheek humorous laid back narration utterly charming. And there are no contests or points or organized competitions taking place. It's simply a film about two surfing dudes in 1965 travelling around the world to catch a wave.
28 years later, Bruce Brown would make a well produced sequel to this documentary Endless Summer 2. It's got better production values, more exciting surfing action.... but it lacks the simple purity of this film.
A gem. If I've sparked any positive curiousity in you about this film, you'll enjoy it. ...",978566400,75,2982,4.8392156862745095
618004,5,630327417X,"""The Endless Summer"" is truly a thing of beauty. Bruce Brown captures so much greatness -- the warmth of the sun, the ocean's vast power and the bond of friendship -- and ties it all up in a humorous and touching tale about surfing. We the audience are swept away to exotic locales -- Hawaii, Australia, and Africa --following the carefree journey of surfers Robert August and Mike Hynson. Undoubtedly the luckiest guys in the world, Mike and Robert goof to the max as Brown's hokey, but oh so funny narration keeps us entertained. In fact, throughout the film, we hear only Brown's voice and some really cool 60's surf instrumentals. I truly love ""Endless Summer"". It effectively captures a time and, perhaps, an innocence which is forever gone. Most of all, it captures our imagination. Who among us wouldn't trade our stressful lives for a life of endless sun, sand and surf? Until I can capture the peace of mind so beautifully expressed in ""Endless Summer"", I'll just have to watch the video over and over again. Enjoy it. Surf's up!",975974400,24,1038,4.708791208791209

618007,5,630327417X,"This was a hard one to review.  As a surfer, I could remember growing up and watching this movie hardcore and when I saw it on DVD, I wanted to buy  it but lo and behold...I saw the back logo...""Image  entertainment"" which to DVD collectors know as a company that puts the  movie on DVD, no extras, simple scene selections and that's it.
I was so  upset to find out that there was nothing else.  Not even a trailer.  Geez... I was hoping that Bruce Brown would have some cool footage...gag  reels or something for this DVD release.  Of course, I recommend the DVD  over the VHS but in this case...the main benefit from buying this DVD over  the VHS is that you know it's not going to degrade from watching it many  times.
I love this movie...I love it!  But the DVD should have  more...
I give the movie an A+ but the DVD a D due to the lack of special  features and nothing else but the movie.  DVD fans expect more these days  but I guess when you get an Image Entertainment DVD, not to have your hopes  set so high.
If you haven't seen the movie or you are a fan and has a VHS  that is degrading due to watching it so many times, check out the DVD  version!",966729600,2,1160,4.09375

I first watched this show in a run-down old theater on the Oahu's  north shore nearly 20 years ago.  What a rush!  Great footage, excellent  story-telling and music.
What is the endless summer?  It's the quest  for the perfect wave.
This movie is probably best described as a  biography of the essence of surfing.  If you are in the mood for an  outstanding break from the digital scenes of current box-office offerings,  and you enjoy watching real people do real things in beautiful real places  -- give this movie a look.
Still a crowd pleaser.  Anyone will enjoy this  movie.

In fact, I rent it so frequently that finally I  told myself that I'm gonna buy it... and that's what I'm about to do... I'm  gonna buy me a movie that makes me feel good to be alive on this little  blue and green planet that's third from the sun.

This film was shot at a time when surfing was done by athletes, when it was a pure sport, before it was tainted by  the image of the drugged-out illiterate stereotype played so well by Sean  Penn in ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"".
Two clean-cut guys  decide one year that they're going to seek out the endless Summer - year  round surfing where the weather and water is always warm.  They start in  Africa and end up in Hawaii. Along the way they serve as surfing  ambassadors to Ghana, Nigeria, Australia, and New Zealand.  They also learn  about the inside joke ""There's no surf in Tahiti"".  El Stumpo,  Ins-And-Outs, and The Other Spot will forever be known by anyone who sees  this film.
