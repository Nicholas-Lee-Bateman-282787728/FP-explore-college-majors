2430907,2,B000BNX4AE,"One has to admit that out of all the horror genres, zombies are the weakest lot.  Ever since George Romero trotted out the NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD movies, attempts keep coming to top him, but ALL SOULS DAY isn't one of the better ones (try SHAUN OF THE DEAD instead).  Credit should go to the writers for at least coming up with a reasonable scenario for the undead's return:  revenge on the greedy man who was responsible for their extinction.  The movie's problem lies in its incredibly slow pacing, and mediocre acting from its leads.  Even brief bits by Jeffrey Combs, Ellie Cornell and David Keith can't make up for the posturing of Maria Ramirez, Travis Wester and the others.  Laura Harring sleepwalks through her role as the mysterious innkeeper and the plot's inconsistencies wear thin after a while.  ALL SOULS DAY won't be remembered as a classic zombie flick, but it isn't any worse than the other recent films of its ilk.",1138665600,3,935,4.664634146341464
2430908,1,B000BNX4AE,This was the most stupid and pathetic horror movie I have ever seen. Anchorbay distrubution of newer horror movies are lousy and pathetic these guys need to put out better ones and stop releasing these garbage.,1138147200,3,210,4.861111111111111
2430909,2,B000BNX4AE,"Even though it has a nearly incomprehensible story and the acting is cookie cutter, All Souls Day is still a somewhat enjoyable B-grade zombie romp; as long as you're a fan of the genre.  The story revolves around a teen couple (Marisa Ramirez and Eurotrip's Travis Wester) whose trip south of the border during the Day of the Dead takes a bloody turn when the flesh eating undead rise.  There's much more to the story than that, but you'll be hard pressed to make sense of it all, so you may as well enjoy the campiness of All Souls Day as long as you don't expect much from it.  The gore effects are about what you would expect from a low budget zombie romp, but they're not all bad, and there's some familiar faces abound as well in the cast, which also features Mulholland Drive's Laura Harring, David Keith, and genre stalwart Danny Trejo.  All in all, All Souls Day is worth a look for zombie fans, and it's much, much better than the recently released Day of the Dead 2: Contagium (which by all means, should be avoided by everyone).",1136073600,14,1040,4.429319371727749
2430930,1,B000BNX4AE,"Even BAD acting would have been an improvement to this 'film', in which you are lucky to see ANY acting.

Truly horrible, don't waste your time. Not scary, not funny, not worth watching.",1197244800,,186,4.636363636363637
2430931,2,B000BNX4AE,"This is a movie that tries to cover a bunch of bases in one fell swoop.  I would actually give it 2.5 stars, but don't get excited... this makes for either campy halloween viewing or super saturday cinema.  There are some moments of cool dialogue and action, but it gets held down by a plotline that seems overly top heavy given the lack of substance. (if this doesn't make sense, watch the movie >wink<). A fair effort, but if you like this sort of movie, there are too many others out there that are cleaner, campier and easier to digest.",1191801600,,540,4.39
2430932,2,B000BNX4AE,"I like  Jeffrey combs.  He was a great Herbert West in the reanimator films and when he gets creepy, he makes a film fun.  I also love Ellie Cornell and have from the first time I saw her in Halloween 4.  I saw Jeffrey and Ellie together and thought that this was a can't miss movie.  The movie started out okay then Jeff and Ellie got killed in the first 5 minutes and a totally unsympathetic cast ensemble took over.  The film did actually have a plot however, and there was a real reason why zombies were running around the town so as far as that goes, it had a step up on most zombie movies, but I just could not get into it.  The actors were not very good and the characters they played were not too bright.  Oh well, it was diverting for a while so it is not a total waste of time.  Rent it though, don't buy it.",1180742400,3,818,4.0
2430933,5,B000BNX4AE,"this is an entertaining film.  Any further than that, you're pushing it.  As has been previously stated; there are some elements of the film that break the mold and make for an interesting ride, but also, there are others that are run of the mill B=grade horror crap.

The acting is pretty standard for this type of film (bad) the plot is a little weak here and there (to be expected)  And the environments are vivid and interesting, the story is engrossing and captivating and the effects are top notch.

if you aren't a fan of B-zombie flicks, i wouldn't be too surprised if this did not apeal to you.  If you are, i'll be surprised if it didn't.",1164153600,2,648,4.4033613445378155
2430934,3,B000BNX4AE,"This is a pretty good zombie movie that breaks some of the normal zombie movie traditions.  The actors are very convincing and the direction and story are very good.  This is not a great film, but because it does break some conventions and I really liked the story, I feel this movie is worth checking out.",1163289600,4,306,4.446428571428571
2430935,1,B000BNX4AE,"I'll make this short.  One of the worst movies (horror and otherwise) ever made.  Obviously direct to video (cheap, no special effects).  Watched it, and gave it away the first chance I had to my poor brother who is also a huge horror movie fan.  Guess I just want to torment him a bit.......",1152576000,,292,4.351851851851852
2430936,1,B000BNX4AE,"First, I would like to say that I'm a huge fan of the zombie horror genre, even a lot of the B-movie ones.  This movie is beyond bad, it's criminal.  The zombies aren't the only ones that are brain dead in this movie, everyone is.  The heroes, if you can call them that, are ridiculously stupid.  No one really seems to use their head and a lot of the characters do the dumbest things ever.  One of the things I recall that is so lame is when one of the girl characters started doing these Matrix like flips in the air and doing incredible martial arts on the hordes of zombies.  I said to myself, where the hell did that come from.  She can take care of herself, but her buffed out boyfriend get a few punches out then gets overwhelmed by the zombies instantly. That was one of the dumber moments which I recall more than others, there are so many that you as the viewer get lost in the whole mess.  This movie had a real good potential for being a great zombie movie.  Putting the Day of The Dead holiday with zombies in a small Mexican village is a great idea, but the execution is a big fat F.  Skip this and watch Romero's movies, ROTLD 1-3, Shaun, and Luci's Zombi 2.",1149984000,2,1173,4.173333333333333

2430938,1,B000BNX4AE,"If you are a zombie movie fan, you will be disappointed in this movie. I'm not a zombie movie fan but I decided to give this movie a try. It delivers a very boring plot with a young couple getting stranded in a deserted town with stupid looking zombies roaming around. The acting was poor and this was a cheaply made movie. Boring, Boring, Boring. Not worth watching.",1140739200,,367,4.411764705882353
2430939,1,B000BNX4AE,"I love zombie movies! But this movie blows!!! I bought the so called "" uncut "" version, there is no blood, no plot, no action, no good acting, etc. Whatever you do DON'T BUY THIS CRAP!!!!

8089838,4,B000BNX4AE,"DVD cover and the condition of the packaging was lousy, but I thought the guy in the movie was interesting. The movie should have shown more authentic Mexican art and culture instead of the Wild West look.",1445212800,,205,4.5675675675675675
8089839,1,B000BNX4AE,"Not one redeeming quality at all to this movie. This has all been done and done so much better. Very predictable, I really hate predictability. Surprise me now and then, please, I wish writers and directors and producers would come up with something different other than the usual rehashed pablum. A woman has to get the car and bring it to the door so everyone can hop in and drive away, (Good idea, right) well, this braintrust babe parks 30 feet from the door with zombies all over and even has the passenger side away from the door????? Bad acting, bad story bad everything only one semi bright spot is Travis Wester as Joss, he gives it his all.",1437091200,,650,4.470588235294118
8089840,3,B000BNX4AE,"There's much to commend this movie. If you are a fan of traditional horror or the more modern zombie sub-genre, then by all means dig in. I particularly enjoyed the folkloric elements surrounding the Mexican Dia de los Muertos and the brief Western flashbacks. Unfortunately, we must counterbalance these above-average features with four unsympathetic and annoying main characters, the usual pop culture spewing college kids typically associated with modern horror flicks. There is also a silly love-making scene and a splash of nudity. All things considered, the positives outweigh the negatives, and All Souls Day is a worthy addition to the collector's library.",1410307200,,664,5.456310679611651

8089842,5,B000BNX4AE,"But I am also a fan of terrible movies. I probably wouldn't have watched this if the trailer hadn't been shown at a movie night I attended and if Jeffrey Combs wasn't in it. It's not the worst movie ever, but it's not the best ever.",1363824000,,232,4.065217391304348
8089843,1,B000BNX4AE,"Let's just get this out of the way. I hate this movie. In light of all the other terrible, terrible movies I've watched I probably shouldn't hate this one as much as I do, but there's just no other way to put it. I love low budget fare. I'm fine with an independent movie with no budget and a cast of first time actors that winds up being a little lack-luster. To have this lavish a set, and respectable veterans like Jeffrey Combs, Danny Trejo and David Keith, and still make such a dull chore of a movie, I find it inexcusable. I feel a great deal of my dislike come from how poorly written it all seems. The story is riddled with plot holes, the main characters come across as extremely unlikable, and with nearly every action they make, you're left asking ""Why? Why would anyone do that? Did anybody read the script and ask whether it was a good idea?"" As a zombie movie fan, I just can't steer you far enough away.",1297728000,,919,4.257142857142857
8089844,2,B000BNX4AE,"It's 1892 in the remote Mexican village Santa Bonita. So remote, in fact, that English is commonly spoken there. An Aztec temple has been unearthed and town bad guy Vargas Diaz, played by why-am-I-always-a-bad-guy Danny Trejo, executes his sinister plan to take all the treasures for himself. Fast forward to October 1952. While vacationing, the White family stumbles upon the village and decides to spend the night in a no-named hotel there. The father (Jeffrey Combs) takes charge and checks the family in himself, despite the fact that there seems to be nobody running the place...despite the last person to sign the register being 5 years ago...and despite momma White (Ellie Cornell) overseeing a woman cleaning up what looks to be blood on the floor. Stop right there. Hold up. I'm sorry, I draw the line on pools of blood on the floor. Even stains of blood are a big no-no. Just walk out, people! I'm sure there's a La Quinta Inn somewhere down the road.

Their complete disregard for common sense ends badly for the family, but not before young polio-stricken son Ricky (Noah Luke) gets an earful of gibberish from an old hag-lady, and daughter Lily White (yes, that's really her name) shows off her lilly white...assets. Fast forward (AGAIN!) 53 years later. College couple Alicia (smokin' hot Marisa Ramirez) and her fast-talking spaz of a boyfriend Joss (Travis Wester), who's got to be on speed, are traveling to Alicia's parents' house. They're delayed after swerving through a crowd of people, overturning a coffin with a naked, tongueless girl inside, and running into a feeble-looking fence, which is enough to put Joss' piece of junk car out of commission right near the very no-named hotel we've seen previously. In an obvious attempt to gather some zombie fodder, two of the couple's friends, Erica and Tyler, drive down from the OC to meet them.

That's the overly inflated setup (which took two long paragraphs to describe) for an essentially simple concept with characters who look hot, but never really develop into anything. Not only do they not develop into much, their actions often are neither plausible nor genuine. The Joss character rarely ceases to annoy. Erica out of nowhere does some kind of crazy backflip onto the roof. Tyler, with a chance to escape the hotel, inexplicably chooses not the undead-free driver's side of the getaway car, but the zombie laden passenger side. And upon being attacked he yells out like a girl, ""Put me down!"" Oh...the horror...make it stop. It's a shame, because while the characters aren't the greatest, they're all acted out rather decently. Though, David Keith, Danny Trejo and the re-animator Jeffrey Combs are completely underused talents.

It's a bloated story with a little action, no real scares, and some talented actors that are off camera too much. Despite the decent production values and some decent-looking zombies, it's not quite a decent movie.",1212796800,,2926,5.0041067761806985
8089845,3,B000BNX4AE,"All Souls Day: Dia de los Muertos is part of the wave of zombie movies flooding the direct-to-dvd (some even going as far as direct-to-cable). This particular zombie movie was written by mark A. Altman who also wrote the campy and very B-movie-like House of the Dead 2. A zombie flick which actually improved on Uwe Boll's own house of the Dead which is not really saying much. All Souls Day is Altman's second try at another zombie movie and while this second attempt wasn't as fun as his previous one it still manages to be a watchable and interesting zombie movie.

The movie is set in a dusty Mexican town that hides a dark secret from its past. A young couple (played by Marisa Ramirez and Travis Wester) happen upon what seems like an abandoned town. They soon come across a funeral procession and when they inadvertently interrupt the ritual all hell literally breaks loose. It doesn't help the two couple that the only person who seems to be real in town is the sheriff but whose own past ties in with the secret of the town. It was very good to see genre veteran David Keith in the role of the town sheriff. His limited time in the movie was pretty good. When the town's people (who by now have shown themselves to be zombies) begin to lay siege on the young couple in the town's only hotel the rest of the movie gradually shows more of what made this particular Mexican town a death trap for any passerby who happen to come across it on All Souls Day. Soon enough help comes in the form of the young couple's two friends who arrive in town only to get themselves stuck in the same dire situation the original couple find themselves in.

The resolution of the movie was handled well and it brought a nice supernatural origin and reason as to why the town's population has turned into flesh-eating zombies. The performances in the movie could be seen as being mixed. The more veteran performers like David Keith, Danny Trejo (as the town's manipulative patriarch) and Laura Herring perform their roles well without being too over-the-top. The actors playing the pair of young couples on the other hand go from very good to awful in the span of moments in some of the scenes. It's really this mixed bag in the cast's performance which keeps me from giving it that extra star to make all Souls Day a very good zombie instead of just being a good one.

The gore effects in the movie was pretty good in the small amount of sequences where the zombies end up doing what they do best once they get a hold of someone. While I was hoping for more of the grue in this particular zombie movie I wasn't too surprised why it didn't have more. Other than the pair of young couple there really wasn't much living people for these zombies to munch on. But for a low-budget zombie movie which had its premiere on the SciFi Channel All Souls Day has the look of a polished movie instead of one shot on someone's neighborhood with a digital camera.

All Souls Day: Dia de los Muertos is not a great zombie by any stretch of the imagination. This movie is instead just good enough to watch without wincing at how low-budget it is and at some of the hammier performances. I would definitely recommend it to be Netflixed for a slow night with nothing else to do but watch something.",1204761600,7,3269,4.443333333333333
