6657232,2,B00NI4JVEQ,"Don't waste your time, another 'nice guy' told to 'give everything up' and the 'universe' will reward you in the end. The acting(if you want to call it that) was up/down sometimes they may as well had the script in front of them reading, the scene would have been the same. Other times they got it right, but just not consistent. Because of the reviews I watched until the end, hoping it got better....it didn't.",1461628800,,412,4.506666666666667
