8526341,5,B0089FEWFM,"I enjoyed Nora Ephron very much. From written word to her movies.
This DVD was a delight, because it featured Nora in different interviews with Charlie Rose.
You get to hear and see her, not just listen to biographic information from a third party.
Do buy it! Would make a nice gift. -- Joe",1385510400,,290,4.388888888888889
