8392251,4,B0039REZ0W,"Interesting movie about second chances and their consequences. David (played by Mads Mikkelsen) loses his young daughter while having an affair with the neighbor. His already rocky marriage falls apart and he becomes despondent, even attempting suicide. However, David finds a door that leads to a world five years in the past, where his daughter is still alive. He has a chance to make things right, but the old David also exists. Suffice to say, things become quite complicated. The movie is compelling, however, I really wanted to inform people about this blu-ray edition. While it is a region B disc, I can confirm that it will play on region A players (some blu-ray discs are unlocked). In addition, because Mads Mikkelsen is Danish and not German the producers of the film made the decision to dub over his part (perhaps they felt he didn't enunciate well enough) which I found incredibly annoying. This version has both the dubbed track as well as the original track which is easy to select from the menu (third option from main menu will give you the audio options, the original track is easy to pick out, it has Mads Mikkelsen's name listed by it, English subtitles are also selected from this menu). The downside, special features do not seem to work (at least on mine they didn't). I'm not sure if this is a region issue that could be fixed with a region free player. I hope this helps.",1501545600,,1397,4.682926829268292

I bought it before but it was dubbed. I searched for it in the original version and I really, really enjoyed it a lot.",1401494400,,128,3.9615384615384617
