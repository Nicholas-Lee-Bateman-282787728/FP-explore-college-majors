I watch them all the time, now that it's so cold  out I get a mug of hot tea(I'm a brit so it's tea not hot chocolate) some candy and my PJ's on and laugh and sing along with the kid's, who were wonderful,most of them are not trained in acting but you can't tell because they are so good. Spend the money and at least get the first  one.  A third one came out in 2014 , with martin clunes in it(Doc Martin) I can't wait for it to go on disc,one of my computer key's won't work guess what one it is,D D.  All the actor's were just right for the parts that they played in which made this one great film. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do. You will need a all region player to watch these films.",1422748800,,817,3.9938650306748467
