4689130,5,B005G5NPGK,This series was very enjoyable to watch with our two daughters while they were growing up.  We ordered them to have on hand for my nieces and nephews.,1356652800,,150,4.357142857142857
4689131,5,B005G5NPGK,This was a great buy! Purchased for my daughter and she enjoys watching it often. I remember this show when I was younger so I end up watching it with her. Price was competetive when compared other retailers. Very...very happy with this buy.,1351036800,3,241,4.627906976744186
4689132,5,B005G5NPGK,This was my first time shopping with amazon and won't be the last! I love this product. Quality and speed of delivery. And can I just say thank god they finally real eased it on to DVD!!!,1349654400,2,187,4.081081081081081
4689133,5,B005G5NPGK,"This is one of the great reasons i love shout factory, Ive been a fan of this show sense it aired back in the late 90's. I'm half way through watching this set and it is amazing how much you forget over the years from not seeing the show in a long time and somethings you catch up on. this is a great set to have along with the first season. If you grow up watching this show like i did pick it up, you will not be disappointed. i just wish they would of come on DVDs sooner. i see amazon has the pr-order date for season 2 part 2 ( its coming out this April ) , I'm defiantly going to order it. i guess my only complaint is that they split the season up into two parts and there are no extras what so ever in any of the season that have come out so far ( i hope this may change later on ) but like i said i HIGHLY recommend you pick up this season set ( just make sure to watch the first season first lol )",1329955200,2,907,3.704663212435233
