208995,5,6300149978,"I watched this film in France over Christmas.  They were apopleptic with laughter.  I had a permanent smile with a few giggles.  I can see why the French love Jerry Lewis.  Do not watch this if you are in need of great comedy.  Do not avoid it if you do not like foreign films because it is highly visual with minimal and very light dialogue.

Watch it because it is well made, interesting and joyful.  You see true village life in France sixty years ago as they  breathe the sweet air of the post-Nazi nightmare.

Tati is both director and most often seen character.  I hesitate to say ""star"" because he does not so cast himself.  He is a thoughtful director because he shot this in both color and b&w, in case the color failed.

Perhaps the funniest theme is the portrait of the U.S. Post Office (which it was then named) as the pinnacle of efficiency, excellence and derring-do.  Warmly recommended.",1202083200,2,902,4.493827160493828
208996,5,6300149978,"My personal favourite film from Jacques Tati, Jour De Fete is gentle, undemanding and very funny. The story of a village postman in rural France the film has little in the way of plot or dialogue. Jour De Fete may be set in a France that never existed but so what? If you are feeling stressed by the 21st century watch Jour de Fete and see how a good quality of life is better than a high standard of living.

To watch Jaques Tati is to see how crass most modern comedies have become.",1106179200,15,484,4.148936170212766

7803102,5,6300149978,"The big day, is a classic from the French Director Tati. In this he plays a postman who is inspired by a film on the american postal service. It is easy to place Tati with Keaton and other classic comedic actors of the day.",1363910400,,223,4.090909090909091
7803103,5,6300149978,"This was Tati's first feature film.  After a career in French music halls and appearances and early writing and directing of short subjects, Tati chose this story, an expansion of one of his short subjects, to begin his compact body of work that ran to 5 feature films plus a TV program.  In the course of them, he won several of France's highest film awards and an American Oscar.

Tati's character of the postman employed some  pantomimes from his music hall days.",1359331200,,466,4.646341463414634

7803106,4,6300149978,"Jour de fte (aka Festival Day, The Big Day) (1949) is the title of a film comedy by the French director Jacques Tati. Jour de fte tells the story of an inept and easily-distracted French mailman who frequently interrupts his duties to converse with the local inhabitants, as well as inspect the traveling fair that has come to his small community. Influenced by too much wine and a newsreel account of rapid transportation methods used by the United States postal system, he goes to hilarious lengths to speed the delivery of mail while aboard his bicycle.

Tati is sort of an acquired taste for me. I'm willing to say that this is a funny and well made film but after seeing two versions (the older black and white and now BFI's restored color version), it still does not come off as the hilarious film that many claim it to be. This does not mean that the film does not amuse or look great because it does.

The color version is a vast improvement over the more often seen black and white. BFI's print was restored by Tati's daughter and this is the version of the film to see. There is not really a great deal of story here. The film is pretty much one visual gag after another. Many have said that Tati's slapstick is a homage to Chaplin but I feel that he invents his own brand of comedy as the inept postman Francois. Perhaps the greatest thing about Tati's film is its overwhelming sense of innocence. It has the feeling of a past time that we may never see the likes of again. While Tati does not provide a great deal of plot what he does provide is an excellent soundtrack. We hear every animal sound, car horn and sound effect. These are the ingredients of the story and Tati uses them to great advantage.

The BFI version that I viewed presents the film in its restored version from the Thomson color negative. The fdisc offers trailers for three of Tati's later films. While the version is still not perfect it is head and shoulders better than the older black and white VHS version that many have seen. If seen for what it is its a well made fun debut to the Tati canon and should be in the collection of any classic comedy fan.",1300147200,2,2141,4.3879093198992445
