7811587,2,630141747X,I was very disappointed after receiving this. It only like half of the concert and leaves out most of the killer songs that appear on the album. Quality was good enough but I just do not understand why they left out half the songs.,1339459200,,231,4.2727272727272725
7811588,5,630141747X,"I have this VHS for almost 20 years and it is simply fantastic. 9 fantastic guitar players getting together to do what they do best... Play some splendid guitar:

Randy California (Spirit)
Pete Haycock (Climax Blues Band) **
Steve Howe (Yes, Asia, ABWH, ...)
Steve Hunter (Lou Reed and Alice Cooper)
Robby Krieger (The Doors)
Alvin Lee (Ten Year After) ***
Andy Powell & Ted Turner (Wishbone Ash) **
Leslie West (The Mountain) ***

** - Excellent performances
*** - Outstanding performances

Also the supporting band lead by Livingstone Brown (bass) & Clive Mayuhu (drums) are fantastic, they give all the necessary freedom for the guitar players to perform like I've never seen before. At the last music there is a special appearance: Stewart Copeland (which IMHO didn't add anything to the show, because Clive was performing much better)

Too bad I don't see plans for this to appear in DVD and/or Bluray... You never know, I may be mistaken and they decide to release it in a newer format.",1275091200,,992,4.817647058823529
