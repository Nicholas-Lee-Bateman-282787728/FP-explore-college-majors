8556923,4,B00ARM3DT6,"Law enforcement aspires to locate and free woman abducted and forced into the paid companion business of  Bangkok, not an easy task and the woman are too scared of the mobsters to testify. (Maybe?) Feels like an episode of CSI.",1507420800,,227,4.675

8556925,4,B00ARM3DT6,"It is much more suspenseful and terrifying than all the movies based on sex trafficking that I have ever seen such as The Whistleblower. It is terrifying to see with my own eyes the Uzbek gang freely and openly commit sex crimes in Bangkok, Thailand. You would not believe it. It is very frustrating to see the police let the suspects go free due to lack of evidence. I was in shock when the victims and witnesses recant their stories after being threatened with their lives by the gangsters.

This documentary shows the investigation is still on going. Nevertheless, it is still interesting.

In short, if you like true crime shows, you will love this.",1399161600,5,653,4.6695652173913045
