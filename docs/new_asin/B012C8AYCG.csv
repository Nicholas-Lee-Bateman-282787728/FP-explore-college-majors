7346865,5,B012C8AYCG,"Your average adult can be forgiven for the impression that this is just another kid's show, because that's a fair assessment of the first couple episodes. There's little doubt that the younger set will love the story with its compelling simplicity. It's the triumph of the underdog; David and Goliath, Luke and Vader (but with a game instead of a big evil guy!); the `age and size doesn't matter' philosophy. Angelic Layer is straightforward, uncomplicated, devoid of innuendo or references outside the show itself.

All this might sound pedestrian, but that basic premise is the obvious layer over the more complex story of how champions are made. Misaki (the lead character) discovers that she's not using her angel (battle doll) Hikaru to fight another angel, but her human opponent; that growing, improving, participating and winning isn't vicarious, but comes from within through conscious effort. Sometimes, in true Samurai fashion, the game is over before it begins; the confidence and inner balance achieved before the start determines the outcome.

So perhaps the local grown-ups shouldn't dismiss it too quickly. This isn't just kids playing with toys; there are real life lessons that we've all faced, with circumstances that even the most jaded adult can appreciate: 1) We've all had a toy we thought of as `real' (the velveteen rabbit thing), and no toy seems as real or symbiotic as an angel in the layer. 2) The game is used as a metaphor/catalyst for the story. The character types and interactions are complex enough to be interesting, true to form with differing motivations for reaching the same goal. 3) We identify with the gaming angle, and we'd LOVE to play!",1452211200,4,1681,5.043165467625899

8725972,5,B012C8AYCG,"This is by far my favorite anime of all time. It has a little bit of everything for all demographics to enjoy. The characters are extremely well done, have depth and backstory that makes sense, and there is growth in everyone through the entire series. I loved sitting down and watching this with my daughter. The art style and animation has held up amazingly well over the years and is as much of a joy to watch today as it was when this series first came out. The fighting sequences are well choreographed and they do well to create tension. I'll be watching this for years to come and hope others give it a chance. I prefer my anime subtitled but it's one of the few where the dub doesn't grate on my ears. Great for both types though I suggest subtitles since the dub does mispronounce some of the names.",1532908800,,808,4.357615894039735
8725973,5,B012C8AYCG,Angelic Layer is one of my favorite anime shows of all time! I was extremely happy to find this show on Blu-ray and very pleased with my purchase! Now if only Funko would make Funko pops of the Angelic Layer battle dolls I would be even happier!!!!!!,1525737600,,250,4.340425531914893
8725974,4,B012C8AYCG,"Angelic Layer, alongside series like Cardcaptor Sakura, represents Clamp anime at its best: charming, innocent, and fun. My heart will always still be with Cardcaptor Sakura for best Clamp show, but this show would make a close second. In terms of children's battle toy anime from the 90's, it has aged far better than most.",1516233600,,324,4.909090909090909

8725978,5,B012C8AYCG,"This is a simple transfer from DVD to Bluray (probably just an upscaling), but it adds the convenience of putting more episodes onto a disc, so this series takes just three Blurays instead of seven DVDs.

Misaki Suzuhara is a middle school student transferring from the country to Tokyo. As she arrives, she sees a broadcast of an Angelic Layer battle. The idea of Angelic Layer is explained to her by a strange man calling himself ""Wiggly I-chan"". She builds herself an Angel (think of a custom Barbie, and you'll get the idea), and starts playing. Angelic Layer is a fighting game where the angel owners control their dolls with their thoughts.

This series is more than a simple fighting game series, though, and we gradually learn about Misaki as she trains and fights with Hikaru, her Angel. It's this larger story that makes this series a joy to watch.

I enjoyed this series as much as I enjoyed Fruits Basket, and like that series, it can be enjoyed by adults and children.",1483315200,,981,4.658959537572255

8725980,5,B012C8AYCG,Purchased this for the kids. We watched it on Netflix and they absolutely loved it. The only issue so far is the case has a crack but I have plenty of DVD cases to replace it with.,1472774400,,180,3.891891891891892
8725981,5,B012C8AYCG,"This is bit older style anime. I enjoyed this. It has its share of Sci-fi. It also develops its characters very well, they certainly have depth. The story line is solid, slice of life, maybe a bit of romance. Drama. No mecha, but the story does draw you in.",1461628800,,257,4.26530612244898
