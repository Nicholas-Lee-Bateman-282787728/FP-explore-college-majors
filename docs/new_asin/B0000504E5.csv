7928666,5,B0000504E5,"When opera seria was all the rage and tales of noble suffering by high-placed mortals, both damsels and heroes, were sung out by castrati and other very high voices, the high-born audiences began to demand something short and light to make the evening more tolerable; and opera buffa was born. Short, noncomplex plots about the middle and lower classes were set to swiftly flowing (or blowing, as implied by ""buffa"") music that led directly to Mozart and then Donizetti and Rossini.
  The best of them all, composed in 1733, is Giovanni Battista Pergolesi's <La Serva Padrona>. The 45 minutes it takes are concerned with a maid (serva) tricking her master (padron) into marrying her and making her the female boss (padrona) of the house. Composed for only two singers and a silent actor, this work is a pleasure from start to end. I was delighted to see that the Opera Rara video tape (OPD-115) has subtitles, the first one I have from this line that does, and that they are clearly presented at the bottom of the wide-screen format.
  Accompanied by La Petite Bande, it is performed on a period stage in period style. And if Donato di Stefano does not have a resplendent voice as the harried master and Patricia Biccire is not exactly a Sills or even a Moffo (who sings the title role on a much older video version), they know what they are about and keep things moving nicely. The ""Si si, non non"" duet is the first to draw applause from a very quiet audience and is probably the most memorable piece in the work.",977270400,7,1515,4.6
