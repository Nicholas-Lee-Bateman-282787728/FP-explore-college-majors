3722774,5,B001NRY6R2,"A very funny and very well made assessment of the low fat (""lipid hypothesis"") vs. low carb diet wars, with side trips into the politics of diets and food production, the unstated vegetarian agenda of CSPI, the political and legal assaults on fast food (and the implicit contempt for the poor and people of color who are ""too dumb and lazy"" to make their own decisions) and the questionable accuracy of Morgan Spurlock's Super-size me. The narrative is well done and the research is credible.

The only thing that's somewhat unbelievable - how did a (funny and likeable) schlub like Naughton get a woman that attractive (and talented - great animation) to marry him? Hmmm...

Great movie, highly recommended.",1237852800,11,708,4.9411764705882355
3722775,5,B001NRY6R2,"This film started out as a hilarious and informative sendup of the Super Size Me documentary from a few years back. The resulting film is that, plus a lot more -- it's also a hilarious and informative sendup of the nutritional industry's disastrous turn of the last several decades!

Now, I'm the sort of guy who will cheerfully devour books like Gary Taubes' meticulous and astonishing _Good Calories, Bad Calories_, but that is simply too much of a long, technical grind for most folks (he was really addressing doctors and professionals in the nutrition industry). I can't give that to my parents, for example. In contrast, this movie is a wonderful resource I can pass on to introduce others to what I've learned from people like Taubes.

Naughton features many of the big names we've come to recognize in this area, like the Drs. Eades, and Fallon and Enig from the Weston A. Price Foundation. And he consulted with people like Taubes -- so even when he needs to simplify something, the result is nonetheless strong. Naughton cleverly, effectively, and humorously addresses topics such as:

* The many distortions and errors of Supersize Me.
* The ""lipid hypothesis"", where it came from, why it's complete crap, and what damage it's done.
* Metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and the mechanisms of energy storage and use in our bodies -- what the science actually says about how people get fat.
* Inflammation and heart disease, and how they really relate to cholesterol.
* How activists and special interests and their coercive efforts via government intervention are responsible for so much dietary mischief that's hurting us.

And the look on his doctor's face after seeing the results of a month of thoroughly flouting the standard advice of the nutrition industry was priceless!

While there is of course much more to say than can be packed into a film like this, Fat Head just became the FIRST resource I'll share with family and friends on this front -- highly recommended!",1234828800,33,1990,4.910714285714286
3722776,5,B001NRY6R2,"Loved this movie. It's hilariously funny, and really puts the truth about diet right in the Fed's face.  It should be required viewing at the FDA, NIH, USDA and the AHA.

3722777,5,B001NRY6R2,"My review cannot adequately do this movie justice!  It is so informative and entertaining.

This is the information you've longed to hear and understand.  Mr. Naughton has a way of explaining how our bodies work that is so understandable.  He brings in respected doctors who also add to the documentary/comedy.  It's very entertaining and such a wonderful work!  I'm thinking of buying this for all of my family.

This contradicts everything you've ever been told about diet and heart disease with true science to back it up.",1234310400,28,525,4.9655172413793105
3722778,5,B001NRY6R2,"If I've heard it once, I've heard it over and over again since I first started writing about the healthy low-carb lifestyle in 2004 after losing 180 pounds on the Atkins diet-when will we EVER get the positive message of livin' la vida low-carb out into the mainstream of American and worldwide conscience? It's a very good question and my response has generally been that it will likely happen on the grassroots level through people telling their circle of influence the truth about nutrition and health. But this new project from Tom Naughton called FAT HEAD has stepped forward to arm low-carbers with a fun and exciting documentary film that can educate and entertain at the same time.

It is being marketed as an ""anti-Supersize Me"" response film that challenges Morgan Spurlock's assertion that he got fat and deathly ill from eating at McDonald's for 30 days. The math just doesn't add up as Naughton so beautifully details in his creative and witty film.  These kind of facts are quite typical of what you'll see in this movie along with a healthy dose of truth, justice, and the American w...errr, I mean, just the facts about healthy low-carb nutrition.

Naughton features commentary and information from low-carb experts like Drs. Mike and Mary Dan Eades, Gary Taubes, Dr. Al Sears, Dr. Eric Oliver, Mary Enig, Sally Fallon, Uffe Ravnskov, Dr. Malcolm Kendrick, and others who give the proper historical context for why obesity seems to be getting worse by the day-it's the low-fat, calorie-restricted, high-carb diets that have been pushed on us for decades since Ancel Keys and his buddies on Capital Hill led by George McGovern in the 1970s made the official American policy on diet. Naughton cleverly demonstrates this in his film with the use of hilarious Monty Python-type of gimmickry and animation.

I had the privilege of interviewing Tom Naughton about FAT HEAD on my podcast called ""The Livin' La Vida Low-Carb Show with Jimmy Moore"" (available for FREE on iTunes) where you'll hear what it was like working behind-the-scenes on a documentary film for a first-time filmmaker, why the premise of Supersize Me is severely flawed, how the REAL reason why obesity is totally missed (insulin and carbs, not fat intake), and the surprising early success of the film being shown in Israel. This is arguably one of the most entertaining podcasts I've ever conducted, so I hope you get a chance to listen to it and then get your own copy of the FAT HEAD DVD for your personal collection. It is THE low-carb event of 2009!

Do yourself a BIG FAVOR and pick up several copies of FAT HEAD to spread the message of the healthy low-carb lifestyle and personal responsibility to the masses.  If you care about healthy living and the TRUTH about it, then that's exactly what Tom Naughton delivers to you on a silver platter!  THANKS so much for all of your hard work and efforts to present the facts, Tom.  So many people will get educated while being thoroughly entertained by your film.",1234137600,33,2994,4.833984375
3722779,5,B001NRY6R2,"Amusing, likable, and amazingly informative, ""Fat Head"" is both a documentary response to Morgan Spurlock's ""Super Size Me"" and a muckraking expose of the lowfat-eating dogma. You think this is a trivial matter? One doctor involved in researching the supposed benefits of eating lowfat called its theoretical basis -- the ""lipid hypothesis"" -- ""perhaps the greatest scientific fraud of the 20th century."" ""Fat Head"" is also a triumph of self-financed, hands-on, DYI filmmaking, plain-speaking funny-regular-guy division. Watch it. You'll learn a ton as well as be very amused. Loads of personality and flair, an honesty about what it encounters -- and the simple animations it's full of are little miracles of info-compression and info-clarity.",1233964800,40,744,5.535087719298246
3722780,5,B001NRY6R2,"This movie is funny and entertaining and amazingly informative. It has so many pieces of useful advice that it's hard to catch them all. Furthermore, it passes along this information in a way that got my wife's attention in a way that I hadn't been able to.

A year and a half ago I was 35 pounds overweight. I ate like the standard American. I finally decided to do something about it so I did some research on the Internet, trying to focus on the science-based research. Following the advice that I found, I lost that weight in 4 months and have kept it off ever since by continuing to follow the advice. This movie captured the basic idea of all that research: low fat is bad for you, low cholesterol is worse than high cholesterol for most people, don't eat high carb food.

He does the best job I've ever seen at disproving the lipid hypothesis which nearly every doctor and media outlet promote: 1) Eating high fat foods give you high cholesterol. 2) High cholesterol leads to heart disease. Well, he makes it really clear that both of these statements are false. It's shocking to anyone who has been fed these lines (lies) for year. He explains all of this in a simplified manner that is within reach of everyone.

The other points that he make extremely well relate to what it is that actually does cause heart disease and what we should do and eat in order to minimize our risk of getting it. Again, he's funny and informative. It's hard to believe that this combination can exist when talking about nutrition, but he does it.

I added this to my library so that I can heartily recommend it to my family and friends. I read (and loved) ""Protein Power"" by Eades & Eades, ""Good Calories, Bad Calories"" by Taubes, and the ""Great Cholesterol Con"" by Kendrick but not everyone is going to spend the time and effort to get through these books. However, this movie presents the highlights of these books in 100 easy-to-watch minutes. If you are intrigued after watching this movie, then I highly recommend those books. And if you were not intrigued, then you weren't paying attention. ;)",1233964800,140,2089,4.562666666666667
3722781,5,B001NRY6R2,"This is a terrific little movie that, among other things, is the perfect antidote to the very misleading and over-praised Morgan Spurlock film ""Supersize Me"" . Naughton, in a very clever and funny way, performs  a real service here, setting the record straight on how we have all been sold a bill-of-goods regarding what constitutes proper nutrition.  In the process, he exposes the Low Fat advice as the load of bologna that it is, and strikes a blow for freedom of choice at the same time.

Funny and smart, you'll be hard pressed to spend a more enlightening 100 minutes, and you'll come away with more practical knowledge than a whole college course in ""convential "" nutrition.

Ronald McDonald is not your enemy, but ""the guy from CSPI"" just might be.",1233878400,21,756,4.748091603053435
3722782,5,B001NRY6R2,"""Fat Head"" is simultaneously a send-up of Morgan Spurlock's ""Supersize Me"" and an expose' on the state of nutrition ""science"". Using humor and Pythonesque cartoons, Tom Naughton does a good job of tipping many sacred cows on the topic of nutrition, showing how the government, media, and special interests combined to yield the current situation: people are eating what's supposedly ""healthy"", yet are developing metabolic diseases like diabetes at an alarming and increasing rate.

The core premise of the movie is to revisit ""Supersize Me"", where Spurlock supposedly showed the evils of fast food by eating nothing but McDonald's for a month. Spurlock gained 25 pounds, was issued a variety of dire health warnings by his doctor, etc. Naughton turns this idea on it's head: he also ate only fast food for a month, but used his ""functioning brain"". Rather than just blindly eating whatever was available, he avoided those foods which science has shown contribute to metabolic problems like obesity, including sodas, french fries, too much bread, etc. The result? Eating nothing but double Big Macs and the like, he lost over 12 pounds in 28 days and his cholesterol went down. The expression on his doctor's face alone is worth the price of the DVD.

""Fat Head"" is very funny and discusses the science of fat gain and loss in an manner which is easily understood. My kids (8 and 4) watched it with me, and they ""got it"". Get a copy and share it with your friends and family.",1233878400,157,1475,4.849206349206349

3722786,3,B001NRY6R2,"Nice counter to supersize me but the overall message was lost at times when he was trying too hard to slam Spurlock or trying to be funny (he's not). Excellent explanation about carbs and gylcemic index along with how the body processes fat and sugar. Also made some good points about how the low-fat craze was based on questionable science but many of his counter arguments/proposals and experts are questionable themselves. Really needed to drive home that the point of the documentary was to show while fast-food is not the healthiest, one can still consume it responsibly if one doesn't overeat,limits carbs, and exercises regularly, but he really only made note of this at the end. Good watch if you're interested in nutrition not so much if you're interested in comedy.",1487894400,,775,4.923664122137405
3722787,4,B001NRY6R2,"Entertaining and informative on many things. Generally, it is worth watching with many easy to understand explanations. I quite enjoy some of the dry humor. Watching your carbs/sugar intake make a lot of sense and he does a good job of making his case with that. I haven't seen Supersize me, but the fact that they won't release their food log is pretty awful and it's good to have him break down the issues with that documentary. The film discusses a lot of myths and points out where the research is often wrong. The explanation of Glycemic Index finally makes sense to me and wow! I can't believe how high GI shredded wheat is. Holy cow!

That said -- he's often condescending and sometimes anecdotal without any citations. He usually does refer to an expert and/or a study but there's a few times he doesn't on things I'd think are a major point. Also he blatantly disregards the effects of advertising-- but hey, advertising works, that's why companies spend money on it.

3722798,1,B001NRY6R2,"I can't even.  I also normally do not write reviews, but as a public health announcement I feel compelled to.  I saw a link to this movie and purchased it, without really reading the content.  It was late at night and it was cheap.  Just another reason to avoid shopping when I'm tired.  I regret not reading more closely, and hope that you, Dear Reader, who was wise enough to read this far will heed my advice.

I finally popped it in the player and settled down to what I thought might be an interesting and different perspective on nutrition.  It wasn't.  It started with a guy justifying his obesity by comparing himself to people who are morbidly obese, leading the viewer to assume that ""Hey, he's not so obese after all"".  At another point near the beginning he stands in front of a fast food restaurant and points out that fast food cannot be seductive or addictive, because look, nobody's coming out to drag him in.  He could stand there all day and nobody will shove french fries in his mouth.

I watched about a third of this, continuing to give it chance after chance and thinking it must be a really poor gag, but nothing of substance materialized.  In fact, it went downhill - pseudoscience, half-truths, goofy testimonials... all the while a guy being chummy with the viewer, assuming I'm assuming I'm looking for a reason to not change poor nutrition habits.  It was so.  Bad.  I agree with the review who compared it to flat-earthers.  I'd liken it to ""But weather changes all the time!!"" to climate change denial.

This documentary mocks Nathan Pritikin, who was found to have the arteries of someone in his 20s when he died at 69. He had a perfect heart and arterial function. Contrast this to Atkins - which this whole documentary is based on defending - who died some 60 pounds overweight and with advanced heart disease.

The part I clung to more was the information about Carbs and its effects and myths about how it effects us.  I used this movie as a basis and learned about Ketosis diet, a LOW carb high protien very high fat diet.

Second, the level of stupidity to give fast food a ""healthy Makeup"" just to fulfill the jealously because of the success for the Super Size Me documentary, is just... Well, inconceivable.

Vegans and vegetarians are definitely a minority, and people who make it a priority to eat ""healthy"" at all are also in the minority (though thankfully more and more people are becoming aware of healthier diets and lifestyles).  Everywhere I turn, especially in fitness magazines and health food blogs, everyone is pushing getting PROTEIN, eating LOW CARB or PALEO.  It's also an actual crime to talk about the poor practices of corporate factory farming, When making ""Cowspiracy"" they had sponsors drop out because they were afraid of the ""controversy"" of speaking against meat and dairy, because they have and will create a lawsuit against those who speak out.

If ONLY there was a government conspiracy to make us eat healthy.  That sir, is bologna.

It's a person's own choice to eat the unhealthy foods they want to eat.  When the documentarian himself sits down to eat a meal with tofu and soy ""chicken"" (which in itself is not the healthiest choice because it's processed food and too much soy), he picks at it with disgust and then orders a pizza.

He didn't do that great of a job discrediting Morgan Spurlock's film because one, near the end of Supersize Me, Spurlock stated that most of his calories came from McDonald's fries and soda. Tom ate at fast food places and didn't eat fries that much and he stayed away from soft drinks. Most people order fries with their meals and large drinks so he didn't really replicate a typical American's experience in those places and he didn't provide that great of a rebuttal to Spurlock's arguments.

Also, I've worked at McDonald's, there were people that came into McDonald's every single day for two, sometimes three meals a day. We, the staff, knew some of them by name because they were regular patrons and the staff would get their order ready for them as they were coming in because these customers often ordered the same thing. So as Spurlock, implied through Supersize Me, many people do eat McDonald's every day and the regulars I saw weren't all trim, svelte.

The other thing is, it was so obvious from watching the film that Tom is pushing the controversial Paleo diet. A friend and I tried that diet for months, eschewing the standard American diet, then ditching a plant-based diet for bacon, eggs, steak, shrimp, salmon, butter, fruit, vegetables and nuts. I found I had strength, but I also found that I felt sleepy after meals, I was mucous-y and gassy from all the dairy, I began to get acne AND my doctor told me that my cholesterol was high. I got off the Paleo diet, went on a plant-based diet, lowered my cholesterol, lowered my blood pressure lost 10 pounds and kept it off. I know there are people who reap health benefits from the Paleo diet, I was not one of them.

Also, he doesn't address the hard evidence citing that eating processed fast food may make you slimmer and lower your cholesterol (it may) but it can also make you more prone to develop cancer. He also doesn't address the fact that a lot of the meat from fast food places is unsustainably farmed and cheap and that while there may be nothing wrong with having meat once or twice a day or a few times a week, most Americans eat so much that excessive meat consumption is impacting our environment through deforestation, pollution, excessive water usage. For instance, it takes 60 to 200 pounds of water to produce one pound of potatoes. But a pound of beef needs 20,000 lbs of water. A farm of tens of thousands of pigs raised for ""Paleo"" bacon needs 75m gallons of fresh water a year. There are water shortages and droughts in some parts of the U.S. and it's not just because it's too hot.

The other issue is that romanticizing the Paleolithic age as Tom does in this documentary is problematic. There were different ethnic groups in the Paleolithic age. Some ate a lot of meat like the Inuit, others from South Africa ate less meat. Also, they didn't just hamburgers, grilled salmon, feta cheese, bison steak and arugula salad. Produce was smaller and, depending on the season, it wasn't very plentiful. Paleolithic man also ate armadillo, insects, lizards, and other humans. Mmmm! They also didn't live past 38 and remains of men from the Paleolithic age show that some did in fact have hardened arteries. Besides, human beings have evolved to eat grains. We are not the same as we were thousands of years ago.

It's also entirely possible that Tom lost weight because he began exercising more as he was eating the fast food. If he did it the way most people do it, order a Double Quarter pounder with cheese, large fries, large Coke before sitting in their car in rush hour traffic for an hour, his results would have been very different.

Last his whole argument that blacks and Hispanics are heavier than their white counterparts because they're body types are bigger doesn't hold water. I'm black and I know why so many blacks are obese. This is not the case of all blacks, but I've been to more black social gatherings than I can count and watched many blacks gorge themselves on platter after platter of ""soul food."" Soul food is Southern cuisine based on the offerings that black slaves were forced to eat hundreds of years ago - chitterlings, pig's feet, etc. Then the food that may not be based on the plantation owner's scraps like fried chicken breast, macaroni and cheese, buffalo wings, pasta salad swimming in mayo and shrimp is eaten by the platefuls and the black people at many of these parties don't play games, other than cards, they don't dance - unless it's a party of young people. They just sit and eat for hours and then dessert is brought out. In poor, predominantly black urban communities, one in which I actually used to live unlike Tom, supermarkets are few, far between and poorly stocked but there are plenty of fast food joints and fried chicken shacks around - within walking distance. In the suburbs and more affluent parts of the city there are plenty of gyms, Zumba, and Yoga Studios, supermarkets and organic grocery stores. At white parties I've attended, there is wider variety of healthy food and rich food, not just rich food and the Whites there generally don't get up for two and three platters. There are also fewer heavy people in the suburbs. My husband and I notice it all the time. When you drive through the suburbs, where Tom says he lives, there are not many obese people. As soon as you drive through working class or poor black and Hispanic neighborhoods from the city all of a sudden it's common to see an obese black person.

This is documentary is just not thorough enough, it's very skewed as an attack on vegans and vegetarians. It's junk science and the trendy Atkins diet all over again, a diet that fell out of favor. There are people who have been pescatarians, vegetarian or vegans for decades and are perfectly healthy. Incidentally, U.S. News and World Report Health ranked the Paleo Diet low on their list as being hard to follow and one that does not allow for long-term weight loss. But the vegetarian diet ranked higher and the experts that give those rankings are more highly qualified than the doctors Tom allows to speak for the documentary (look up the good docs featured in this documentary, their resumes are not all that impressive).  I didn't give the film one star because I did think Tom was funny a few times and his intentions were good. Poor execution, though.",1441238400,2,6691,4.653976311336717

To all the reviewers who say this is will convince people that an all fast food diet is healthy, watch it again with an open mind because you missed the point. He is eating a fast food diet in order to debunk Spurlock's supersized lie, using Spurlock's method. When the month experiment is over,  he starts eating a low carb, meat and vegetable diet.

It is the work of one man who is deeply committed to sharing the truth about how food affects our body. I applaud him for taking on this project and I am grateful that he did. The overarching theme is a direct response to Morgan Spurlock's film ""Super Size Me."" McDonald's (and the fast-food industry as a whole) does not force us to eat their food and when we walk into their restaurant, they do not guide us to what we need to order. We are free people with the decision to eat what we choose. Having said that, Tom Naughton proceeds to dive into debunking many of the things that we grew up hearing in school, such as counting calories and the food pyramid. He takes on many of the government views on food that many of us have disagreed with for years, but did not have the research to back up. The tone of the movie is funny and after watching, my husband and I found ourselves quoting some of the memorable lines. My personal experience tells me that the diet that he promotes works and his research is completely sound. Since I cut down on carbs, I just feel better. I don't live completely carb-free, but making a few modifications to my diet has helped me to feel much better and happier.

3722881,4,B001NRY6R2,"I think this guy's premise is missing the underlying truth, but 4 stars for an honest, funny and much needed response to ""Super Size Me"" and all its baloney.  The opening is great... just watch it.  Later on, the film reveals a lot about the busybodies in government and elsewhere that want us to live on celery, squash and spinach.  One of my favourite bits is the interview with the tall, skinny college professor who reveals his own BMI is in the overweight range.  But mainly, Fat Head chronicles the filmmaker's fast food diet, which totally destroys the myth that fast food makes you fat and sick... just blows it out of the water on many levels.

 My contention with the film is that he disses eating grains, and he (and the doctors he interviews) believes sugar and starch make you fat and sick.  If you believe that, I have one word for you: Asia.  That's right, explain Asia.  White rice, wheat noodles, (daily staples)-- no fat people to speak of, no type 2 diabetes problem.  Then read about the Twinkie diet, then watch this film.  I had to pause this twice to give my kid the info that was left out... and I don't think it was intentional, I think he just doesn't understand it.  For instance, when he is explaining insulin resistance and high blood sugar with little cartoons, the narration leads one to believe that the sugars from your diet end up in your bloodstream (true) while the protein that you eat does not (it actually gets turned into sugar and ends up in your bloodstream a little later.)

I wish he would've eaten the french fries; I think he would have done just as well in terms of health and weight-loss, assuming he swapped out the calories somewhere.  He could have eaten a regular cheeseburger with fries instead of a huge one with no fries.  The end result of what he did is like saying fast food isn't bad for you, only about half of it is. (He drank diet soda also.)

That said, I got a lot of good information out of this documentary and would well recommend it after verifying some of the research it cites independently myself prior to ever running across it. I first encountered it doing some personal research while trying to manage a case of NAFLD I've been fighting on and off for a decade, and ran across both Gary Taubes and Nina Teicholz well before watching. 60 lbs later I can attest that, at least for myself, replacing carbohydrates in the diet with non-trans healthy fats (which surprisingly to me includes saturated fats) do honestly help to shed weight and keep it off long term. Not because it's magically ignoring the 2nd law of thermodynamics, but because fat intake is inherently more satiating then carbohydrates. Even though fat has more calories per gram, I tended to eat less overall far easier and with less hunger constantly tempting me. Granted, there was more then a bit of exercise thrown in, but I do believe eating more fat will help the average person to control their own diet better then most other approaches. It's counter intuitive to what we've been taught for years, but that doesn't mean it's wrong.

The paleo diet derived supposedly from the paleolithic era is completely fictitious.  Historically people have been eating grains, corn, beans, for as far back as history goes.  There is no way reasonably to tell if a person's diet based off of thousands of year old bones, which were likely only maybe hundreds of years old considering the erroneous time guessing game they call carbon dating.  Trans fat is bad medically speaking and this video often confused HDL with LDL in their references.  Your body creates cholesterol in relation to Trans fat, people don't get heart disease over night or from one week of eating just fast food, while eating just fast food for prolonged periods of time does put you at risk.  What this video demonstrates is a straw man stating the government got it wrong(which I agree with), therefore paleo got it right (I don't agree with). If your going to watch this take into consideration, much of the video is pro paleo diet, take it with a grain of salt.  They spout facts (that are not facts) as evidence.

3722940,5,B001NRY6R2,"I have watched this documentary at least 10 times. It's interesting to read the 1 star reviews for this because the first time I watched it, I said a lot of the same things those reviewers said. But then I watched it again, and again, and I took what one of the doctors Naughton interviewed to heart, and actually did my own homework and ""dug through the medical literature"". What I found shocked me. What Naughton discusses in this film is absolutely 100% true, and to those 1 star reviewers who said he didn't research this film at all, you are very much mistaken (I would suggest going to the film's website and taking a look at the recommended readings). For a comedian, he really does know his stuff. I was 315 pounds when I first watched this film, and it sparked my interest to look at scientific literature from peer-reviewed journals, other films, blogs, etc. I have discovered that a low carb diet is the best thing for me as I dropped 150 pounds, got rid of pre diabetes, and eliminated my intracranial hypertension papilledema. I recommend that if you have trouble with the content that was covered in this documentary, to do your own homework as well. In fact, you should never take what anybody says at face value, you should ALWAYS go to the peer-reviewed research if possible.

The second main gripe I believe people had was the ""right wing agenda"" of this film. Even though I would classify myself as conservative, I do have to agree that the libertarian element is there. However, it didn't bother me so much and I think a lot of it is justified, especially the segment on McGovern. I certainly didn't know that the food pyramid was written by a vegetarian political lobbyist rather than a nutrition professional. So, I am grateful that he taught me something about our history that I didn't know. If people are still interested in learning more about this stuff without the politics, I recommend watching CJ Hunt's ""The Perfect Human Diet"" (also available on Amazon). That film really digs into the research and actually interviews Taubes which I really enjoyed.

Overall, I think this was a great film (despite the low budget, I really don't see how that's a justifiable criticism). I have to thank Mr. Naughton for his efforts, as I might not be here today had I never seen this 4 years ago. I firmly believe that at some point the research will make its way into the mainstream media, and people will (hopefully) be able to accept the fact that fat doesn't make you fat.",1403308800,8,2492,4.623024830699774

It was pointed out several times in the documentary that ""he has a brain"" and that ""McDonald's isn't forcing this food onto you"" which is the truth. The point that Spurlock was making is that the easy access to these types of foods definitely have an effect on our decision making. It's far too easy to pull in the drive thru and get a cheap hamburger/cheeseburger than to put together a meal for ourselves. The impact that McDonalds has a far more reaching effect than just eating there (see: Food Inc). I believe Mr. Naughton has some personal issues with Morgan Spurlock, hence the constant attacking of him and his documentary.

While the first half of the movie, and Tom Naughton's demonizing of Morgan Spurlock, was a little silly, the movie really picks up in quality around the midway point when he begins to talk about the lipid hypothesis of cardiovascular disease.  His research and his explanation is 100% correct.  Of course the movie doesn't really prove that Morgan Spurlock's experiment was false.  If you look at fast food in general, a large majority of what is on the menu is either sugar or starch.  The Big Mac with a coke and fries for example has the cheese and burger (assuming extra corn and starch was not added to the beef) is fat and protein.  The fries, coke, bun, ketchup, tomato is sugar.  That Mr. Naughton decides to go to a fast food place and purposely keep his carbohydrate intake under control is fine except it's quite difficult to do in normal circumstances.  For example, in one scene he orders chicken mcnuggets but holds the french fries.  Almost no one does that.  Morgan Spurlocks point was that most people eat the Big Mac with a coke and fries and hardly ever order water without fries.  Simply put, if Mcdonalds was healthy food, eating it for breakfast, lunch and dinner shouldn't be a problem.  But it isn't...because of the sugar content.

What is really important in this movie, however, is not that the lamblasting of Morgan Spurlocks movie.  The real meat and fat of the movie is his proof, in the last 3 minutes, that a month solid of eating saturated fat and protein lead to further improved results in his cholesterol profile and weight.  He honestly should have done a movie about that whole concept and left the fast food out of it.

A shame...he really missed an opportunity here.",1401494400,,1891,4.702127659574468

3722960,2,B001NRY6R2,"I tried really hard to watch this. His viewpoint is somewhat valid. But his attempt at comedy is just lacking. And all his ""video footage"" of people on the street were filmed in Burbank, CA. I know because I used to live there. Therefore, it invalidates a lot of his arguments... for example, how hard it was for him to find grossly obese people. Burbank is a relatively wealthy city. Had he moved his cameras to south LA, he would have had found grossly obese people in no time.

Naughton does a good job of calling Super Size Me out on it's BS. But Fat Head's own arguments are very weak. Much of his arguments are of the ""when I was a kid"" style... which assumes that there's some kind of ""normal"" in America that isn't there.

The best positive I could give this is that the truth lies somewhere between Super Size Me and Fat Head, so watching both could help a person develop some clarity. But stomaching Spurlock's sensationalism in addition to Naughton's failed attempts at comedy might be too much for many people to handle.

And in the end, the only real truth that you can get from both movies is that french fries are bad. Both films showed that it is possible to stay thin as long as you stay away from french fries.",1400371200,2,1228,4.37719298245614

Although he comes at it indirectly, Tom shows you how the vegetarian-evangelists and junk scientists have led our government to endorse junk nutrition with a diet high in Carbohydrates and Trans Fats. The government-endorsed diet simply does not work and does not mesh with the reality that you and I as human beings are being led to believe a bunch of phony nutrition advice that is contrary to what Mother Nature intended!

3722964,1,B001NRY6R2,"My main gripe with this documentary is that there is no criticism of genetically modified foods or biotech corporations such as Monsanto. Naughton simply did not do enough research. Instead, Naughton just engages in childish attacks against groups such as CSPI and people such as MeMe Roth.

My other main gripe with this documentary is the fact that Naughton avoids sugary sodas by consuming diet sodas instead. As bad as sugary sodas are, diet sodas are even worse. They can cause low blood sugar (and trigger diabetic shock) and the craving of sugar. (These cravings are often satiated by the overconsumption of foods which are loaded with sugars or starches.) And most sugar substitutes also wreak havoc on the central nervous system. (Aspartame is linked to headaches, vision blurriness, and even cancer.)

The only main talking point in Naughton's attack against CSPI is the CSPI article where they supposedly defended trans fats. The truth is, CSPI just didn't have enough evidence at the time to fully convince them that trans fats were indeed harmful. (This is why CSPI waited until 1992 to declare trans fats were indeed bad.) The common fallacy of ""CSPI was for trans fats before they were against them"" has been parroted by other like-minded right wingers such as Mary G. Enig of the Weston A. Price Foundation. (Search for Enig's biased article ""The Tragic Legacy of the Center for Science in the Public Interest"".)

Naughton would have been more credible if he had researched CSPI's ties to the Academy of Nutrition & Dietetics (formerly the American Dietetic Association) which is a steering committee member of CSPI's National Alliance for Nutrition & Activity and is directly funded by Monsanto, the National Dairy Council, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, Coca-Cola, Wendy's, McDonald's, and Kellogg.

If Naughton had revealed the fact that CSPI allows a food industry front group to sit on its NANA coalition and dictate official food policy, his credibility would have increased tenfold.

If Naughton had revealed the fact that the ""personal responsibility"" advocates - such as the Center for Consumer Freedom and the Consumer Federation of America - are funded by Big Business, Big Food, and Big Ag, his credibility would have increased tenfold.

If Naughton had revealed the fact that a right wing extremist by the name of Michael Savage actually used his radio show to call for fat people to be put in forced labor camps, his credibility would have increased tenfold. (Search on YouTube for ""Michael Savage - Solution To Health Care Crisis"".)

Instead, Naughton engages in strawman arguments and fails to present the hardcore facts and evidence which would have made this film credible.

I don't see this documentary as ""McDonald's propaganda"" or even ""food industry propaganda"". This documentary is mostly ""Weston Price propaganda"". But mainly, I see it as your standard right wing conspiracy theory film.

If you want to watch a worthwhile documentary, I recommend ""Forks Over Knives"" ""Fat Sick And Nearly Dead"" and ""Food Inc"".",1399248000,17,3062,5.144869215291751

He clearly describes the role that sugars and carbohydrates play in weight gain. Also, what is very interesting is his discussion on how restricting calories is not very effective in losing and/or maintaining weight especially if those calories that you do consume are coming from sugars and starches since these will only make people hungrier sooner. From my own experience, I have learned that this is also very true. I do not count calories but try to limit the amount of carbohydrates most of the time to no more than 50-60 grams a day. I was able to lose over 70 pounds putting this into practice. I actually consume over 1600 calories a day ( 5'3 female) which according to the charts is more than what I should consume for my height and level of activity and I have been able to maintain my weight and I even keep losing a pound or so every month. My most recent blood work was excellent. My triglycerides went from 200 to 90 with this low carb lifestyle and I feel very energetic.

Watch this movie and see for yourself afterwards how you view ""what we have been fed"" by the 'experts'. There are though some good experts out there that seem to be trying to let us know that maybe we need to rethink what we eat and if we go about it right, we will lose weight and be much more healthy.

Tom Naughton does a good job becoming the 'guinea pig' to show us what he found out. And he gives us lots of humor sprinkled in to keep this movie rolling along ;-)

The first half is funny and educational. It's easy to understand and well organized. You learn about types of cholesterol, what the numbers mean, and you get plenty of pokes at Spurlock's ""Supersize Me"" farce of a documentary.

The second half...watch this in a quiet place and be prepared to be amazed. Here the Lipid Hypothesis is attacked. What is the Lipid Hypothesis? It's the belief that made us put nutritional panels on food, it built the food pyramid you learned as a child, it fuels almost all diets, it is a multi-billion dollar industry that tells you low-fat diets keep you thin and lower risk of heart disease. And it's NOT TRUE.

The citations are great. I googled the names, dates, events, entities as they were brought up and even found on the National Institute of Health a document admitted the fallacy of the Lipid Hypothesis.

I think everyone should at least view this, and if you've struggled with diets much of your life you need to see this. I don't advocate changing your diet based on one film, but this is a great starting point for understanding food and your body better.

The point when the documentary really went south for me was when he talked about how parents wait outside school at the end of the day to ""pick up their fat children.""  At the end of that segment, he showed a shot of a school bus and claimed that children spend 2, 3 or sometimes 4 hours a day on a school bus. I am a school bus driver and I know for a fact that's not true.  Maybe in districts where children live miles away from their school that might be a possibility, but in a small town such as where he says he live?  I find that hard to believe.

Throughout his documentary, he presents things the media and, particularly, Morgan Spurlock make and calls them baloney.  But it would seem as though Tom Naughton is just as guilty of it. He throws out his own facts, not bothering to explain where he got those figures or even flash headlines across the screen to prove his point. No, he just shows cheap animation to ""prove his data"" and then moves on to the next topic.

I'm all for exposing baloney you claim others are throwing at people, but when you use those same tactics to shovel out your own baloney, I find it hard to swallow what you call facts.",1392681600,3,1354,4.26171875

3723032,3,B001NRY6R2,"Necessary presentation of the predicament our government busy-bodies have put us into dietarily.  As of this writing, the FDA is pressing for banning trans-fats, which is ironic since those same bozos made recommendations agains cholesterol in the 70's and 80's.  Human beings evolved to eat meat and saturated animal fats and cholesterol and mounting evidence shows that this is indeed fine and not disease-causing, whereas the darling Wheat and other products of Big Ag are esentially toxic.

First star deducted for Naughton's under-appreciation of the Obesity problem.  He does allow for the more complex examination of chronically high blood sugars in both obese and normal people as the mechanism for disease while obesity is more of a marker for concurrent disease, but does the viewer a disservice in suggesting he should ignore this marker when so many chronic ailments are also caused just by the weight itself (think knee replacements, lack of will to exercise causing a vicious cycle etc, etc.)

Unfortunately Naughton is also a horrible presenter.  My girlfriend left the movie after 20 minutes because she couldn't stand his whiney tone and attitude.  I clenched my teeth and filtered him out and tried to focus on teh info, though by the time the second half of the movie came, which held most of the meat of the argument, I was a bit numb.  His doctor also gave the worst raspberry of the movie by stating he's not a fan of running.  As a doctor and once-anthropologist myself, I'd love to publicly see what that guy knows about anything.

I had never heard of Tom Naughton before this but he was very funny indeed.  It was nice to see someone show that fast food is not the problem with obesity.  It is choices.  Yes, he lost weight by eating only fast food.  However, he did it by watching his carb count for the most part.  The people in charge of dietary recommendations in Sweden have started recommending a low carb, high fat diet to all of its citizens.  Even the children.  They have done extensive studies into nutrition and have shown that carbohydrate reduction is the key to weight loss and general health.  Since the world looks to Sweden for its impartial medical studies, I was very impressed.  Low fat diets do not work as well as low carb ones.  That has been proven before.  But it is a hard sell because the US govt. has pushed the low fat diet on Americans for decades based on flawed research.  After Tom finished his ""diet experiment"", he followed the low carb diet for the next month and saw the proof for himself.  Eating the way that people did before the invention of the food pyramid is the way to go.  Saturated fat is not bad for you and thank goodness for that.  I have lost a lot of body fat by eating this way and I was fat for over 30 years.  It works and I've never been healthier.

People shouldn't assume that just because Tom ate 3 fast food meals a day that eating like that is an acceptable diet plan.  Keeping track of your food intake and measuring the results could prove beneficial information as to what you should and should not eat.

Take this video for what it is - an informative documentary produced by a comedian - and not as your meal plan or a means to argue your case that fast food is ""good"" for you.",1388534400,,805,4.269736842105263
3723052,5,B001NRY6R2,"I just caught this movie on a streaming service and found it very entertaining.  Its a bit funny, a bit cynical, points out the huge gaping holes in nutritional science and dietary advice, and its fully watchable by most people.  Many of these sorts of movies become pretty dry and humorless.  Not this one.  Tom is a comedian and computer guy by trade.  He has himself checked out medically, then eats nothing but fast food.  He does skip the supersizing, the soda and goes easy on the fries.  But he eats giant burgers, salads and so forth.  His food log is available on his website, something Morgan Spurlock refuses to release.  He lost weight and his next checkup showed improvements in his blood work over the baseline.  Tom then doubles down, eating giant steaks, lots of vegetables drowning in butter, and cheese fried in a pan.  He keeps eating fast food but skips the buns.  On his third checkup, he's lost an even more dramatic amount of weight and further improved his blood work.

A few years ago I did the same sorts of research and came to the same conclusions so it was fun to see the movie.  After trying for years to lose weight by not eating meat or fat and increasing my intake of whole grains and juicing like crazy, working out all the time, cutting calories, etc...I couldn't lose weight.  Kept going on a few pounds a year.

When I actually read the nutritional studies and saw how much data they threw out and how they came to conclusions unsupported by the data, I kept reading more and asking more questions.  It became clear that we really have no conclusive or even remotely good data on what is good for us and what isn't.  And that's too bad because I think most people would eat better if they knew what really was good or bad for them, and what we had absolutely no idea about.  Are eggs supposed to be good or bad for you these days?  Why is it that we're all eating healthy whole grains and running a juice machine 24x7 and we're still fat and diabetic as a nation?

An epiphany came to me while watching ""Survivorman"", that his 'diet' was probably a good start.  Simple whole unprocessed foods.  When dropped into the wilderness, Les would find eggs, try to catch some fish or trap a rodent or small animal, ate bugs and larvae (okay, I didn't go for that), green shoots, berries and other fruits, he drank water and sometimes found a root or tuber to stick in the fire for a while.  I also watched Alton Brown's ""Live and let diet"" episode.  While that still eschews meat and fat, the idea of nutritionally dense foods vs calorie dense foods clicked.  What we drink is a big deal.  I think if most people only changed one thing, drinking only water, they'd find they lose a tremendous amount of weight.  We consume an enormous number of largely empty calories in what we drink every day.

While the movie does a nice job of debunking Spurlock's ""documentary"", I don't recommend a lot of fast food.  I do however find it hilarious that most people look at a fast food meal and think the meat and cheese are the problems.  Its actually everything else, from the bun to the soybean mayo to the sugar drink and the fries cooked in factory seed oils.

Spurlock's movie reminds me of what makes me nuts about Mythbusters.  They say they're going to do something, then they do something completely different.  Spurlock said he was going to see if eating fast food for a month would make you sick, then he ate far more calories (mostly from carbs) than he had to, or that anyone likely would eat, AND he cut his walking in half at the same time because that's all the average person did.  So what he tried out wasn't if fast food or meat or fat is bad for you, he found out what happens when you cut your usual routine in half and add 2000-3000+ calories a day of carbs to a regular diet.  I don't even need 30 days to figure out what's going to happen there.  Then it took him forever to lose the weight while eating his girlfriends super vegan diet.  Big hint number two.

A good tool that helped me was getting a Fitbit.  I spent a few weeks putting my food into its database and while that was a bit onerous at times I was amazed at how many empty calories/carbs I was still eating while trying to avoid them.  It was a real eye opener to get a full profile of what I ate in a day, and it helped me change up lunch and dinner plans to better balance my dietary goals.  I don't do that anymore, but the device is still handy for figuring out if I've done my 10,000 steps in a day.

The end result of all of this was I lost almost 100 pounds, went from XL shirts and 42-44"" pants to M shirts and got all the way down to 32"" pants, which is what I wore in high school.  My blood work is beautiful with low cholesterol, crazy low LDL, good blood pressure and everything went from being bad to good.  My pre-diabetes and pre-hypertension went away.  I feel great, I'm never hungry, and I always have plenty of energy.

So watch the movie and try it out for yourself.  Its quite accessible and will tell you in a little over an hour what it took me months of reading to come up with.  Hard part is going to be listening to everyone you know tell you that you're going to have a heart attack when your blood work is better than theirs.

As an aside, my 80 year old dad started losing weight and displaying symptoms of dementia last year.  When I looked at his diet he'd been overly heeding the doctors advice on nutrition.  He'd stopped eating meat and fat and was eating basically 3 lean cuisine frozen meals with diet shakes and gobbling supplements that have all been demonstrated to either not work or be bad for you.  I changed him to my diet of ~40-50% fat, most of it saturated from animal sources, hemp and coconut, ~30-35% protein and the rest carbs from non grain sources.  And we dumped the supplements.  His weight normalized from 135lbs (on a 5'10"" man) to 152, his dementia symptoms vanished and his energy level returned to what it was 15 years ago.  He's completely healthy now where less than a year ago I was starting to consider nursing homes or having to have him move in with me.

Aside from turning healthy younger people into obese diabetics with high blood pressure, todays oddball diet advice may also be ruining the quality of life for the elderly.  Many are preparing meals for one, in some mild to moderate daily pain which can cause depression, listening to the ""dont eat meat or fat"" advice, and like my dad gobbling a handful of pills and spoons of liquids every day that are supposed to help.  Aside from separating them from their fixed income cash its causing them physical and mental issues.  My dad was simply unable to consume enough calories eating ""healthy diet food"" to maintain body mass and get enough glucose in his brain for it to operate.

Funny that until the 50's everyone knew that to lose weight you had to cut back on the carbs.  Drop dessert, breads, pasta.  Standard medical advice to the overweight, and it always worked.  I doubt that 60 years of evolution trumps 2 million.  The proof is in the escalating diabetes and obesity rates since the carb heavy dietary advice went into effect.",1388534400,2,7167,4.39741641337386

3723068,5,B001NRY6R2,"Twenty five years ago my wife and I bought into the government and medical community hype about reducing meat consumption, dropping cholesterol, the need for grains and eliminating fat from our diets.  At the time we both were healthy and fit.  We only worked out about 3 days a week but we could walk, hike, ride bikes, at will and not give a thought to how far we were traveling.  We never counted calories or grams of saturated fat or any of that stuff.

Once we made the changes though we found we started gaining weight.  We got tired and hungry easier.  We restricted our calorie intake but found we still gained weight as soon as our will power faded.  We worked out more to get rid of the weight but it didn't make much difference.  Eventually due to schedules we found ourselves working out less.  The pounds just piled on.  We also both experienced increases in cholesterol and mood swings.

Once again we bought into the hype and stayed away from the high protein diets and went vegetarian.  The pounds piled on.  We figured we weren't doing it right and when we just gave up and accepted our obese condition the pounds really piled on.  We were hungry all the time.  We didn't understand what was happening.  We were trying to eat according to what we were told by the government and the medical community what was healthy.  Frustrated doesn't begin to express how we felt.

We watched another movie about macronutrients and began including those in our diet; whole juice green smoothies made with fruit, nuts, green leafy vegetables, seeds, and roots.  We started feeling better.  But no real change in weight.

Then we watched Fat Head.  I minimized the grains and starches, kept the fruit/veggie smoothies, and added more meat, eggs, bacon, sausage, etc.  We stopped counting calories and just ate when we were hungry and stopped when we were satisfied.  My wife is having a tough time giving up the grains and her weight isn't changing much, but she has lost two pounds.  I had no problem cutting them and my weight is dropping like a rock; ten pounds in two weeks.

Before the change I couldn't go more than two hours without getting hungry.  Now I go 4-6 hours before I feel the first hunger pangs.  My mood has improved significantly and the fluctuations I was having with my vision are gone.  The best thing is that I don't feel like I'm on a ""program.""  I'm eating what I enjoy.

And the cholesterol medicine that was forced upon us by our doc?  My wife and I gave it up a little over a year ago because she and I could not work out AT ALL!  I'd end up with muscle cramps and what felt like a lactic acid burn for more than a week!  We were exhausted all the time.  When we had a weeklong event coming up that required walking and biking miles every day we couldn't prepare until we said screw the cholesterol medicine.  It took about a month but we could work out again!

Watch this movie!  It will answer nagging questions you are having.  It has funny parts but the medical professionals interviewed in the film told me exactly what I suspected all along: we've been sold a crock of you know what by the lobbyists, the government, and the pharmaceutically controlled medical industry.",1385856000,2,3208,4.532286212914485

3723071,3,B001NRY6R2,"This could have been a very good documentary.  For some odd reason, although the author gets everything right, he seems more interested in entertaining us than spelling it out.  The movie tends to wander.  Let me ""spell it out"".

1.  Fast Food Nation is a lie.  That is a HARSH criticism of that work but let's face it....he's been caught lying (and quite frankly should fear the wrath of McDonald's lawyers).  This brings up one of the main points this movie doesn't stress enough.  There is a radical vegetarian movement linked to communism, that spends ALOT of money, time and effort LYING to you about what is healthy and what is unhealthy.  That being said, there is a grain of truth in what they say about fast food.  But choice is the primary consideration here.  I'll go so far as to say that choice has to do with carbs.  Outside the occasional fruit and vegetable sold as fast food, refined carbs are very bad for you but can be eaten in limited quantities by most people.  He does come out and say what that limit is (100 grams a day) but glosses over it so fast, it's possible to miss this.  Fathead is, on the surface, a repeat of Fast Food Nation, using common sense.  He ate whatever he felt like and get the refined carbs under 100.  He ate a reasonable amount of calories for someone his size and weight.  I'd actually estimate he overate by about 500 calories a day....but that is my opinion.

2.  The result.  He lost weight and improved his cardiac profile.  So much for Fast Food Nation.  And here is the second point the movie does not emphasize strongly enough.  There is, in fact, correct eating and incorrect eating.  None of this, well, for me.....BS.  Correct eating is anything that improves your cardiac profile (no not theoretically improves your profile....did I mention all the LYING going on).  The only legitimate way to answer the question, what is a good diet is through measurement.  Blood pressure, blood sugar/A1C, lipid profile, C-reactive protein....and to a lesser degree, weight.  A good diet improves these things immediately and more, over time.  This is far more important than you think.  Give me ten random books on diet and five of them will be filled with bald faced lies but nine of them simply can't pass the clinical measurement test.  Eat that way for a month.  If your numbers do not improve or get worse, than it's wrong.  I will go further.  You have to eat a reasonable amount of food.  Reasonable, to my definition is somewhere between 10 calories per pound of non-fat weight as measure by an impedance scale at the extreme low end....to 10 calories per pound total, at the high end.  Outside these ranges are proven non-viable diets (100% failure) without resorting to stomach stapling.  Many diets that are WRONG, can cheat by reducing calories to an unreasonably low level.  Compliance approaches zero as time passes without force.  If you need your digestive system stapled shut or need to be kept in solitary confinement, your bread and water slipped under the door, well, some people go to extremes to deny the fact that a viable diet requires a certain amount of calories.

3.  Not sure if this should be a point of the movie.  This documentary exists primarily to reveal that ""obesity"" for the most part is made up and the response to the made up problem are politically motivated and fail the measure test.  Most importantly, it reveals that reasonable people who make good choices, easily eat healthy in our society.  What if you do in fact, have problems.  What if you are obese, or worse, diabetic.  The answer to that is eat meat.  The healthiest cultures, both today and in the past, eat meat and only meat.  You can also eat whatever fruits are non-sugary and high fiber and any vegetables that are non-starch.  However, the sicker you are, the less carbs you can tolerate.  A non-sick person can eat a limited amount of refined carbs.  A diabetic can't.  I absolutely demand that you not believe me and that you go see your doctor, have your blood work taken and only then, eat as I suggest and see the results.  Most people who eat only meat will have things like high blood pressure, disappear.  Diabetics have to be careful.  Your A1C will normalize over time.  Your blood sugar will normalize immediately.  Don't be fooled.  You are still diabetic.  You will always be diabetic.  Your doctor will tell you if only you lost ten pounds....that is a lie.  The truth is, never again will you be able to safely eat refined carbs.  You can and will go months with normal blood sugar, eating only meat.  Then, you will eat a donut.  Be sure to do a stick and measure what happens.  You will be horrified.  Normal people are allowed to slack.  We diabetics are not.  Also....be very careful of the lying liars....I mean, the vegetarians, fruititarians and juicing jackasses.  The first time you juice and take a glucose test and you will know to throw that garbage away.  Same with the first time you think, well, I can have fruit for breakfast....it says so in this new, ""cure diabetes"" book I got.  Test.

3723073,2,B001NRY6R2,"Initially excited to see this movie for information about new weight loss theories, I was quickly disappointed when it went off the rails and became a shill for the fast food industry. He substitutes limited anecdotal evidence from his interviews, including a biased selection of man-on-the-street interviews, as a substitution for scientific evidence.

Early on he states Morgan Spurlock of Super Size Me drank a gallon of sugary soda each day during his 30-day experiment. But the calories are not included when Tom Naughton rails about Spurlock's doctor's claim that he ate about 5000 kcal/day. Naughton is implying Spurlock is hiding something, but it is Naughton who is. Naughton claims to like math, but does he like accuracy?

There are some interesting points in the movie and I wish he had gone more deeply into those. Instead he picks on interest groups that espouse vegetarianism who want more transparency. There is nothing paternalistic about wanting labels on food items - it supplies the individual to make better informed choices. You have got to be kidding me that the argument against it includes the information already being available to everyone, in libraries and books in the bookstore. Someone who doesn't have time to cook for themselves is not going to take the time to pop in to the library to see the calories on the small vs. large fries.

Disappointing and ultimately I had to stop watching because the tone deteriorated into a whiny bashing of critical examination of the obesity epidemic. And by the way, Naughton, I too went to a public place (last year) to count the obese. For 10 minutes, I only counted those who were noticeably very heavy, giving the borderliners like yourself a pass. It was over 30% and this was in a busy, downtown, northeastern city with people from a variety of races, ages, and probably classes, though I was hardly about to ask to verify that. The sample size was in the hundreds.

Go try it for yourself. But please don't take two people's personal stories about some subject and draw a whole theory about it (aka Pritikin diet leads to depression, or that kids playing in McDonald's Playland reject the food there because one girl did).

He then starts talking about the bad rap that fat has in the media and medical profession.  Who would expect the government to tell us the truth when money can be made?  And scientists are not neutral, as long as they need money for their funding.

Finally, the topic of carbohydrates and how it jacks with our blood sugar and insulin levels is illustrated.  Seriously, a helathy diet for a diabetic is a lot of GRAINS?  How crazy is that?

3723082,1,B001NRY6R2,"I have seen the documentary ""Super Size Me"" and thought the filmaker Morgan Spurlock in that documentary went a little too far, as it seems there are times that he was not hungry but force himself to consume the food from McDonalds.

Well, if you over consume anything, regardless of what it is, you WILL get fat.

""Fat Head"" on the other hand, say to dispel the claims made by ""Super Size Me"".

I can say the only useful information that you can get from this movie is how your insulin level causes obesity and you thus avoid sugar and carbs as much as you can.

Other than that?

An entire documentary that is even more skewered and one-sided than ""Super Size Me"".

The documentary already set alarm bells in my head when Naughton say it took him HOURS to get footage of obese people, which opens the documentary.
I do not know where Mr. Naughton lives, just go to any malls or place where there's a large number of people converging and you know what I am talking about. There isn't a People of Wal-Mart website for nothing. Then again, it is shown that social economics play a role in obesity.

In ""Super Size Me"", Morgan Spurlock blamed the fast food industry for making people obese whereas Tom Naughton in Fat Head demonstrated in obnoxious fashion (no, it was not even funny) how no one is forcing him to go into a fast food restuarant.

Of course, he cited willpower...blithely forgetting that most people go into fast food restaurants because they are
1) EVERYWHERE.
2) Cheap and affordable (and the 'poor people' whom Naughton rightfully say are not stupid but neglected to mention the food choices they have to make because of a LACK of choice and how far can their dollars go also influence their choices).
3) They are Fast...and most of us do not have time to go to a restaurant for lunch when most of us only get one hour time for lunch.

(On a side note, it seems Naughton himself had no willpower when he went vegan and went on juicing because the former made him depressed and the latter gave him no energy...but he never consider that the same mechanism and/or reason that made him depressed and had no energy are the same mechanism that drive some people to overeat.)

Naughton then proceeded to test out his experiment by eating McDonald to lose weight....BUT not the fries nor eating the buns...eating only certain choice items and counting his calories.
Sorry, this is a skewered experiment from the get go. You do it all the way, or not at all and do a half-a$$ job. And it also proves that yes, SOME fast foods ARE BAD FOR YOU...like the starchy fries and the diabetes inducing milkshakes.

Again, he did not put into account that most people get the value meals (avec the fries and soda) as getting the sandwich separately is more expensive.

Ultimately, this documentary tell you to eat fast food (or any other food for that matter): properly and in moderation...as some of it IS bad for you (thus contradicting the purpose of the experiment) thus one star for that. Another star for the information on insulin (which I found out about something else, a documentary called The Skinny On Obesity which can be found on Youtube). But I have to take one star off as Naughton himself came across as a smarmy know-it-all who do not connect himself to the audience other than the converted who want someone to tell them that fast food is good for you.

But given how many OBESE people I have seen this past Labor Day weekend at the Walmart up in Fishkill (you've been to one of those, Mr. Naughton?) I can say is this:

People who eat fast food wind up like more Morgan Spurlock than Tom Naughton. As the saying goes, the exceptions prove the rule.

This documentary probably got the attention of a ton more viewers because of this comparison (and the video cover) than he might have otherwise.

I also didn't fully understand why he capped his calories at 2000.  I think had he cut his carb count down to 50 g per day & even allowed for more calories, he could have lost the same (or more) weight & saw good results from his health markers.  Also, adding daily exercise to his regiment added another variable to a not-so-perfect study.

I downloaded Naughton's food log. He never ate fries or drank sugared sodas, ate only half a burger, and ate salad many times. He also spends a lot time mocking and criticizing the lipid hypothesis, but then goes on to hype the carbohydrate hypothesis, which is just as suspect. He also exercised 2+ hours per day, which is great, but hardly typical of your average fast food junky.

Super Size Me made the point if you eat a lot of fast food, including burgers, dairy, fries, and consume copious amounts of sugared sodas, and don't get enough exercise, you are going to get fat and unhealthy. Fat Head makes exactly the same point, only in a round about way.

Still, I'm glad I watched it. And though I only gave it two stars, I recommend it nonetheless.

My husband and I watched it for the first time nearly 2 years ago, and I wouldn't even recognize most of our old, ""healthy"" diet...thank goodness!

Since watching Fat Head, my family and I have changed our diet 180 degrees, and we could not be happier! These are the changes we've seen:
- I rarely have mood swings anymore (used to be much more frequent than I'd like to admit)
- We all have SO much more energy than we used to have (I don't even drink coffee or caffeinated soda b/c I get too hyper)
- I thought I had ""adult acne"" and it has since cleared up 100%
- My hair & nails are growing in measurably thicker than ever before
- Our dentist has commented that all of our gums & teeth look better than ever
- We never worry about counting calories, and yet we never gain weight (unless we eat sugar or starch)
- My husband is now stronger, while only lifting 2-3 days a week instead of 6-7
- We haven't gotten sick even once (cold, flu, etc.), and never go to the doctor
- We only take 1 supplement daily now, and used to take dozen of pills for ""prevention""
- We have blood panels run every 6 months, and every single important marker keeps getting better and better (for diabetes, heart disease, inflammation, etc.)

Without this movie, I don't know if we would have changed a thing about the types of foods we use to fuel ourselves. After watching, we spent the next 3 months researching sound nutrition advice and dietary studies to determine the diet we now practice. It has completely changed our lives...100% for the better.

Also, it was informative, yet disgusting to learn about the role that trusted authorities and government officials have played in steering medical research, joining forces with Big Pharma and Big Ag, and advising us all to eat a nutritionally bankrupt and potentially toxic diet.

3723128,5,B001NRY6R2,"First off, I highly recommend that everyone watch this documentary, whether or not you believe your diet is healthy. It seems a bit slow and abrasive at the beginning, though the latter half is really what you need to see.

What's good - Very hard evidence that the lipid hypothesis is complete garbage, which is the heart of the message and what you should actually take away. Yes, he attacks Spurlock vehemently - but if all ""Supersize Me"" did was reinforce faulty beliefs about the lipid hypothesis in order to make money, then his criticism is well deserved. If you still have an issue with this, rest assured that this part of the documentary is tangential to Naughton's real message and only serves to illustrate the issues with the status quo of popular knowledge about nutrition.

What to think about:

These are a few minor problems that I have issue with that you should think about a bit more carefully.

Diet Soda - In the documentary Naughton substitutes sugary drinks with diet drinks and never really discusses the issues of this. I'm not trying to argue that artificial sweeteners are carcinogenic or otherwise toxic (they may be, but the science is shaky on this), but rather that they are detrimental to a good low-carb diet. No, artificial sweeteners do not contain sugar or carbs whatsoever, but they are still sweet. Hence, artificial sweeteners are the methadone of sugar - a sugarless crutch to get you off of the real thing, but not a permanent replacement. In short, if you're still overloading your brain with an unnatural amount of sweetness, no matter what the source, your body will continue craving it and thus your sugar and carb cravings will continue.

Obesity as a symptom, not the actual disease - This is very true and Naughton does hit on this topic, but maybe not enough. Metabolic Syndrome is the real issue and you don't have to be fat to experience all of the same detrimental health problems that are typically associated with being fat. I know this because I was of a ""healthy weight"" even though I felt like crap, and this was precisely why. This is such a huge point, though I feel Naughton loses sight of this towards the end.

BMI - This is a minor point but still worth mentioning. Naughton talks about how healthy people can be considered overweight or obese according to their BMI, however, the opposite is true as well. Hence, many people with healthy BMIs actually have too much body fat. These people are described as ""overfat"" but not necessarily overweight, and this group comprises about 10% of the population. Again, Naughton talks about the issues with BMI but never really states that body fat percentage is a better metric on which to judge obesity, which it most definitely is.

Advertising unhealthy food to children - Naughton writes this off as free speech and points to parental responsibility as the solution. While I share his strong support of free speech and personal responsibility, we have to realize that we're not dealing with completely rational adults, and often advertising to kids goes a step too far. It's often an issue of classical conditioning. This is what goes on in a child's head: (favorite cartoon character) = (pleasant experience) , and (favorite cartoon character) + (sugary cereal) = (pleasant experience) , thus (sugary cereal) = (pleasant experience). As strange as it may seem to us, kids have a certain amount of ""trust"" in many of the TV characters that they know and love, and younger kids often don't even understand that food can actually be harmful. Add to this that junk foods are pleasant in and of themselves, and you've got a pretty big issue. Yes, parents should control what their kids eat, but sometimes they aren't always able to. This kind of junk food is available at schools and often at corner stores in many neighborhoods where kids have the ability to buy things on their own. I think Naughton is a bit of an idealist on this point.

Again, this is just my very nitpicky critique, though I still highly recommend Fathead as it's a wealth of health advice and a striking expose' of the failures and fatally misguided intentions of government and special interest groups. I adopted a very low sugar and low carb diet prior to watching Fathead and I've lost a lot of body fat (while maintaining my ""healthy weight"") and I've really never felt better. This is a paradigm-shifting documentary that you really must see.",1371772800,7,4426,4.784031413612565
3723129,3,B001NRY6R2,"I found this movie to be a worthy if not as well done and more right wing counterpoint to Supersize Me. Mr. Spurlock was better funded, better at presentation and went about his ""test"" in a slightly different manner then Mr. Naughton.

Both movies make good points from different sides of the coin. You can eat fast food or unhealthy food in moderation. You should exercise. Eating lots of carbohydrates are bad, no matter how they are made up. Our food education is sorely lacking as a population(yet everyone interviewed on the street could tell you burgers and fries were bad). The way our government works and funds research isn't always about what's best for us (duh). Finally, our levels of sitting around are increasing,which isn't helping us. Mr Spurlock took aim at the fast food industry, this film took aim at Mr. Spurlock.

 Both have their fair share of creative film-making involved to make their points. What this film misses is that what is in fast food isn't particularly good for you either and that kids at schools get ""fast food"" daily as part of their lunch. I'm not saying what they get is McDonalds, but most of it is processed food because it's cheap and schools need to cut costs somehow. So a kid that has lunch at school and then McDonalds(or even frozen nuggets for example) for dinner is eating lots of processed food.

I won't go into anymore detail, but if you watch Supersize Me, you should probably watch this. And maybe King Corn, but it moves very slowly and the filmmakers had even less to work with than Mr. Naughton.",1371772800,6,1554,4.64

But, if you have a functioning brain, you might consider eating few carbohydrates and doing some light exercise. McDonalds is no the enemy, your inability to control yourself is the enemy.

The message of this film says you can eat junk food in moderation (surprise!!) and you'll be fine. The fim postulates that 'Supersize me' was a misrepresentation because few people actually eat like that. Which is true, few people eat at McDonalds for every single meal.

Following the end of his fast food diet, he starts eating more natural food, though with similar parameters to his fast food diet in terms of fat content and carbohydrates.
By no means is Tom telling everybody to eat fast food, in fact, his blog promotes a diet rich in more organic foods. His daughters and wife are also following the diet, and are very well off.

3723169,3,B001NRY6R2,"Okay this is going to be a versus review.

Supersize Me vs Fat Head

Supersize Me is a cautionary documentary. Fat Head is a prevention type documentary. What is misleading about Supersize Me is that Spurlock does not make it clear that he was pro- fastfood at the beginning of the film itself- this point is disappointing and very vague. It's about food addiction and when the food addiction can start- when we're young. It touches on nutrition a bit but not completely. Food Lobbying is brought up but it doesn't bring up the rules of the FDA or the origins of the rules or the organizations that watch over our food. Spurlock splurges on food with no care. That's the point- it's more about addiction than anything.

A lot of criticism similiar to Naughton's view came out right after Supersize Me was getting a lot of attention, that Spurlock was being an ass and that you can maintain a healthy weight by eating anywhere you want. There were people putting up rebuttal diets online and being interviewed of how they were able to loose weight at a fast food joint. Including McDonald's.

Tom Naughton found the movie so annoying that he made his own film. Though some of his facts are on point, did he really have to lampoon the movie that he was rebutting? Not every documentary has to be funny to be convincing. I see documentaries all the time, not all of the have a sense of humor. Yes, Spurlock tried to be humorous, but that doesn't get me to listen to someone's nonfiction flick, and it shouldn't be the basis for listening to someone in the first place which some other reviews think it is. I'm kind of 'Just the facts, ma'am' kind of person.
  Yes, there is a thing called choice as Naughton puts it, but when you're an addict you make up any excuse to get what you want and that you'll behave accordingly . . . later. With careful planning and not being addicted helps to not only maintain weight but to loose it as well. Even Naughton moderates red meat. The Spurlock doc is not advocating veganism, the end credits and Spurlock's own attitude towards such a lifestyle was not the main point (or the agenda) to his flick- addiction is. Spurlock consumed on the basis of his craving for fast food not on just about feeding himself.
  Naughton's angle is about nutrition and what the government keeps basing the rules on (which I found out from another movie) information that has been nullified- but they're still going to do it this way. Why? Because leaning towards carb/sugary diet is cheaper to ship and process, and therefore everyone eats. Sounds noble, right? If everyone is getting fat/or not meeting the standard of nutrition how is that great?

  Naughton's low carb approach is nothing new, but like all diet/lifestyle plans they need be researched carefully before starting them. Again with the choices, right? I'm not making you get tested. But not saying to get tested is negligent on my part. As if all you need to do is get a couple of books and that's that. Doesn't work that way and, both Spurlock and Naughton lead by example on this point.

 I'm not a Spurlock advocate nor am I on Naughton's side. Spurlock doesn't really talk about nutrition and Naughton is all about choice. Fine, have the steak, but if someone wants to eat a bowl of broccoli that's a choice too. There just isn't a need to cringe at veganism any more than hating a meat-eater. That did bother me with Naughton. Also, weight loss and weight gain is not necessarily pinnacles of health either. Yeah, you can balance the burgers, chicken sandwiches, and salads all you want. But if it's all made out of trash patties, enriched white flour buns, and veggies soaked in ceasar dressing with the lowest nutritional lettuce (iceberg) you can't call it healthy either. The best thing you can do is listen to your own body and how it reacts and keep researching. '
 I recommend looking up the documentary called 'InGREEDients' made by a nurse, David Burton, and a video lecture by Dr. Robert H Lustig called Sugar: The Bitter Truth.' The latter supports Naughton rather well.",1365292800,3,4071,4.6282940360610265

3723176,1,B001NRY6R2,"There is so much to say really.  For starters the film is not entertaining.  He comes across as a smug and smarmy narrator.  So if you don't like the narrator...what he preaches can be hard to follow.

He interviews only people who agree with his point of view - Everyone he interviews has sold best-selling books on the subject of nutrition and diet so they aren't exactly objective.

According the film's general premise.

*The diet industry is not motivated by profit - In his viewpoint everything is manipulated by the government

*The multi-billion dollar fast food industry has no lobbying or advertising power - that is just a total farce

*The meat and dairy lobby is somehow voiceless, anemic and powerless against this vast government conspiracy - that is just laughable, agribusiness is hugely influential.

Some major flaws in his argument

*He tries to compare the diet of ancient man with modern humans. - Modern humans couldn't sustain 7 billion people without grain and agriculture AND ancient humans only lived to be about 35-40 years old.  With a population that died off so young, there is no way of knowing what their cancer and heart disease rates would have been.

*He lampoons only one plant-based diet focus group and completely discounts all others - there are dozens out there, why only focus on one group?

*For every study he cites in his documentary there are plenty that would refute his claims.

*He claims Spurlock's 5000 a day calorie intake from McDonald's was inaccurate, yet when I re-watched Super Size Me, Spurlock often had the milkshakes, which are high in calories and that were never considered in this film's criticism.  Some shakes have around 800 calories, so adding two of them in a day could top the 5000 calories Spurlock claimed to have been consuming.

*This filmmaker also didn't eat fast food as most Americans eat it.  He purposefully manipulated his diet to meet low carb standards.  That is all well and good, but it is unrealistic as most Americans eat fries and other fine carbohydrates when they eat this food.  They also drink a lot of sugared soda.

*But my BIGGEST problem with this film is how completely leaves out our MASSIVE FARM SUBSIDIES  That just doesn't make any sense.  Fast food is only possible because our tax dollars keep the price of certain food items ridiculously cheap - including corn feed beef, corn oil and of course high fructose corn syrup.  And corn is only one crop that is artificially kept low in price.  How could he not mention farm subsidies and in the same breath comment on government taxation and regulation.  He repeats the mantra ""Follow the Money"" several times in the film.  He never addresses the issue of subsidies once, it just doesn't add up.

*And often he doesn't tell the whole story, for instance, when he tries to compare frying food in something like lard vs. trans-fats he leaves out an obvious incentive any company would have for using the artificial and dangerous trans-fats over lard.  It isn't necessarily the illusion that trans-fats were somehow healthier...IT IS COST.  Got to any grocery store and price lard vs. partially hydrogenated vegetable shortening.  The shortening is not only cheaper but shelf stable.  Lard has to be refrigerated and can go rancid and is far more expensive.  Corporations are driven by profit, trans-fats increase their profits.

The only thing that seemed sensible was his criticism of cholesterol lowering drugs such as statins.

Major differences between the two films

*Spurlock also interviewed food lobbyists who represented the very industry he was criticizing.  - Fat Head contained absolutely no counter argument which ultimately weakened the whole piece

*Spurlock went to three doctors and got a battery of tests, this filmmaker went to one and his tests didn't seem as comprehensive.

*Spurlock addressed the issue of junk food in our nation's schools and its effects on children. - Totally not discussed in this film

*Spurlock didn't exercise, this filmmaker exercised six times a week.  The point to Spurlock not exercising is that he was trying to replicate the typical American's sedentary lifestyle.

*At the start of both experiments, Spurlock was 11% body fat, whereas this guy was already 30% body fat...so they are hard to compare as one was in much better shape than the other

The science presented in Fat Head is one viewpoint that can be found in any number of nutrition books that promote a low carb, high protein diet.  It is not exploring anything new.  But if you want to watch a fairly unlikable man jump on someone else's idea and then preach at you for the duration of this film...go for it.  The production value is poor, the music is dreadful, the graphics amateur, and he also says the word baloney about 100 times.  I wanted to eat a salad as soon as I finished watching this mess.",1364688000,62,4864,4.869671132764921

 If I thought Morgan Spurlock's Supersize me was little ""low level"" for me, it's okay because it is shown to middle schools kids across the nation. That was my only gripe. I never feel blown away by what he says but in 8th grade, I might have been.  This guy on the other hand, makes horrible associations and proves nothing. The only way to like this movie is if you already think like he does and you just want to see someone act it out stupidly. ""Are you going to make me eat the fries?"" what a stupid line! Does anyone suggest we are forced to eat the fries? Does anyone suggest we are forced to buy new clothes for the different seasons, use electricity or drive cars instead of walk?? Of course we are not forced by the hand of a single other person but by an entire society that conforms to these standards and accepts them as natural and right. SO...no one forces us to go there, but it's the only place I can take my daughter to play in a play place for free if I buy food. It's the only place she wants to go cause she loves the ""toys"" and it's one of the only places I can afford on my salary to get out of the house on rainy days!

He's on the most solid footing when attacking the fat-phobia and the idea that somehow, fast food is solely/largely responsible for obesity. Those aren't really disputable facts.  He also highlights the fact that, while Spurlock claimed to consume 5,000 calories a day, he won't release food logs...and even with McDonald's, 5,000 calories a day is hard to hit.  I liked those parts and hopefully people watching the movie that didn't know that already can use those as positive take aways from it.

1st, he claimed that calories in/calories out isn't as important as people make it out to be, and brings up the starvation mode theory.  There's several problems there: We don't go into starvation mode quickly or easily. It takes prolonged hypocaloric intake (just how long depends on how hypocaloric your intake is).  Second, and more importantly, is the fact that he DOES, in fact, track his calories and keep them at around 2000/day for the experiment...thus helping him  lose weight. So, while he's saying caloric intake isn't terribly important, he's still tracking it and using it to lose weight. He's also counting carbs, which is good, but he is still, correctly counting calories.

2nd; he uses himself as an example of someone who is incorrectly classed as obese...but he's got 30% bodyfat according to his doctor.  A healthy male should have bodyfat percentage in the teens to 20% or so, not 30%. 30% bodyfat means you've got a significant chunk of fat you should lose.  He's right that the BMI is garbage, but he's not exactly a picture of prime health either...but he's trying to use himself as an example of such.

3rd, and most pervasive, is simply his tone.  He regularly dismisses everyone who disagrees with him as morons or shills, and does so in an ingratiating manner.

Don't get me wrong; he makes a lot of good points about the flaws in Super Size Me, and in some still pervasive misconceptions about what is and isn't healthy.  But he does so in an incredibly annoying fashion, and makes some flubs of his own while doing so.  I'm still glad he made the movie simply because Super Size me was truly awful, and he did address some of its flaws...but this isn't exactly a paragon of film making either.",1363737600,3,2492,4.747099767981439

Sure, you could maintain your weight by eating selectively at McDonald's for one month, but does that mean the food is healthy? or that you are healthy?

While it's certainly possible to lose weight and even show some numerical improvements, the methodology and conclusions are quite flawed.

Tom supplemented his burger-laden meals with dishes like creamed spinach and steamed vegetables. He avoided many fast food staples like regular sodas and fries. Fast food items and menus are designed to include both of those items and are certainly commonly consumed. So what is Tom trying to show? That people who eat fast food usually don't have a 'functional brain'?

He is so precise it borders BORING or NON ENTERTAINING. I love when he makes fun of the fake marketing schemes or other ""Journalist"" If you love to film things or write long papers about what you see, eat, drink, or feel - PLEASE STOP RELEASING THEM TO THE PUBLIC!

Its now 2013 and the diet Tom talked about is called PALEO or nicknamed the CAVEMAN diet. It consists of Protein, Veggies, Fruits, Nuts and Seeds. No corn, potatoes, soy, or beans allowed. Only Olive Oil (COLD) is allowed. You may cook with Coconut Oil or Butter (no other dairy is allowed) Ghee or Bacon Fat.

Like all other great diets, even Paleo is being pushed to the limits now with Almond Butter, Coconut Flour, and many packaged PALEO accepted fried Banana chips. These all push the limits and will eliminate the purpose.

I tried the diet for 2 months then modified it suit my needs of business, social, and financial needs. That is where Tom says that in the end, USE YOUR BRAIN. On a business meeting, I can't be a HIPPIE or on a 1st date don't be PICKY. Strick Paleo is extremely expensive.

So let me get this straight...Tom can eat fast food for an entire month and improve his biometrics, but we eat too much fast food as a nation which is why we are over weight.  Huh?  Tom also shows us how it is next to impossible to take in too many calories at a fast food restaurant.  He contradicts himself a lot and I just don't understand his logic.

There isn't a professor teaching any subject today who doesn't relate to his/her students some item that was a solid fact years ago, that's now laughable today.  While the movie goes to the extreme in debunking 'Super-Size Me', it does bring out three solid points. 1) You are responsible for what you eat, 2) Sugar, and in particular sugary drinks, are a leading cause of excess caloric intake, and subsequent weight gain, 3) exercise, even in small amounts, can minimize the effect of many poor nutritional habits.

The generally low production value, bad direction, and flat humor just makes this petty documentary difficult to watch.

Super Size Me was by no means truly science-based, and though anecdotal it was a great cautionary tale as many Americans do in fact have similarly extreme fast food diets.

3723224,1,B001NRY6R2,"I could not even get through all this program.  I'm shocked and surprised that a so called ""Computer Scientist"" can do something like this with so little scientific evidence and on the opinions of a handful of people just with their own self deluded and failed ideas.  Most of his panel are not doctors or nutrisionalists but a few people in offices and a couple in white coats that talk about their opinions with very little or no scientific fact.  Naughton then goes onto trash the ""Supersize me"" which in many cases seems like splitting hairs.  He talks about Spurlock's 5,000 calories and then compares what he could eat - like he calculates around 3,600 instead of 5,000; big deal isn't it like moving deck chairs on the titanic - it's kind of obvious that you'd put on weight either way with that kind of eating.  He then makes out he's calling Spurlock's production company and making out they didn't reply back to him.

His ""science"" consists of interviews people on the street and tries to make out it's scientific.  He asks people to tell him what they think of calories (high or low) when he shows them a plate with a Big Mac and fries and a large coke.  He also takes a camera out and says it took him 2 hours to find pictures of really fat people.  There's nothing in the program about the tens of thousands of people who end up in hospital with chronic and life threatening illnesses like heart disease when many of these people are not ""seriously overweights"" either.

His worst thing though is to criticize the ""Food Evangelists"" by having a few people with zero scientific credibility trash the so called ""Freedom infringement"".  He even compares them to the prohibition lobbyists.  It's like an NRA guy calling anyone who wants to introduce gun checks ""liberal hippy commies"".  He picks on one advocacy/lobbyist group the CSPI and does a very poor job of trying to discredit them.  But you can do that with any lobbyist group and poke holes in their argument.  I don't even think the CSPI is particularly credible, it's like picking on the weakest guy in the room and doing him over and making out you're a ""hard guy"".  His small amount of scientific credibility is Eric Oliver, PhD from University of Chicago and he's only stating the obvious like intake of high sugar contents beverages and snacking are causing obesity.  He even says the CSPI is a ""very well intentioned organization"".  He tries to make out that because they are advocating vegetarianism then they are a ""vegetarian organization that is their only interest, not the interest of the public"" and ""promoting mis-information for the benefit of some industries"".  Well, I've a shocking surprise for you Mr Naughton, so does every other advocate group out there.  He then lists dozens of food items that the founder Michael Jabobson and CSPI has warned about as being dangerous.  Things like Eggs, Eggplant Parmigiana, gyros, grilled cheese, fried rice, hamburgers, meat loaf, scones, etc.  However, if you look closely at what 95% of these foods are it's either high in fat, salt or has animal fat/protein like meats and dairy.  Feccuccini alfredo is singled out then he goes and asks people in the street how many of that dish they have eaten then asked them how many heart attacks they've had.  That is just plain stupid!  It's the issue of the dish being processed pasta and high contents of fat in dairy not how many you've eaten in your life!

If you watch this take it with a large ""pinch of salt"" and watch something that can provide you with more of the facts and less cheap and tacky opinion and ""science"".",1358726400,18,3598,4.680445151033386
3723225,3,B001NRY6R2,"It's nice to have movies out there challenging the conventional (and wrong) assumptions people make about weight loss and nutritional health (hint: they're not the same thing), but I didn't enjoy this movie.

Straw man tactics abound, wherein he takes down arguments nobody was making (or mischaracterizations of arguments that were made), and I found the narrator's voice really, really annoying.

Now, that's probably a silly bias but, man, he is one unlikable dude. You can really only get away with that level of snark and cynicism if you're really clever and, well, clever people don't resort to equivocations and straw man arguments. So he just came off, to me, as a slightly bitter, mean-spirited guy whose entire movie is based on a distorted premise.

The sad part is I totally agree with many of the messages he was attempting to convey! I've told my roommates, all of whom have struggled to lose weight while I shed pounds nearly effortlessly, that buying the stupid low fat version of everything won't help them lose weight. It may improve their cardiovascular health, but they were only gonna lose weight if they monitored and reduced their calorie intake AND considered the effects of the types of food they are on their cortisol and insulin levels. So it's sad that he couldn't sell me.

I think his really shallow indictment of fad diets (which deserve to be indicted) is a good example of why I didn't like this movie. Not because he's wrong for indicting them, but because he relied on anecdotes and simple logical fallacies. For example: ""I cut out fat and it just made me depressed"". Well, duh, dude, you probably had a low-grade addiction to fatty foods and simply abstaining from them for a few days and then quitting because abstaining from them made you depressed doesn't really prove anything.

I think this same subject matter--even these same arguments--in the hands of a different filmmaker would have been way more effective.",1358208000,8,1954,4.909090909090909
3723226,2,B001NRY6R2,"Like Tom, I thought Spurlock was full of s*** in a lot of ways.  However, I was very annoyed at the constant jabs that really didn't serve much of a purpose.  For example, when discussing the amount of calories that Spurlock claimed to have eaten in his documentary, Tom puts together various McDonald's menu items to try and convey how he couldn't possibly see how Spurlock could reach those calorie numbers.  However, it was glaringly obvious that while Tom would put the audience's focus on the fact that he just added a super-sized order of something high-calorie, like french fries to the apparently already huge order, he had in fact just substituted that double angus cheeseburger with a filet 'o fish sandwich without saying anything, which has significantly less calories and ultimately reduced the overall calorie count as a means of misdirecting the audience into thinking that his purposeful deficit of Spurlock's calorie claims would happen no matter what.  If you're going to attack someone's credibility, don't do it by skewing the information and inadvertently challenging your own.

That was a small example, but I really don't like when someone feels the need to convey information to others as if they are stupid, or that they think it is okay to manipulate the information in their favor.  For the most part, the weight loss journey itself was interesting and I'm glad I watched it.  But I can't rate this very high.  This is more of an incredibly biased, persuasive essay in video form with petty remarks, a s*** ton of medical hearsay, a comedic narrative, and an under-nourished portion of actual information and actual interviews (bringing in actors to exaggerate what the interview ""would have been like"" or to mock the interviews in Spurlock's documentary, again, doesn't do anything for one's own credibility).  As entertainment and something to which I can relate?  Sure.  But I'm not going to rate it high because I can relate to it.

First, the movie is great, down to earth, and informative. It's not just a rip on Super Size Me. It's worth viewing for anyone who has been frustrated with, or turned off by many of the ""healthy"" options that exist in most grocery stores. My family has tried vegetarian fare for long stretches of time, and while we lost weight, that line of dieting was only working as long as three conditions existed: the money to afford it (proper energy burning on a vegetarian/vegan diet means consuming A LOT of food, and occasional meat substitutes), the ability to go and get it (not all stores are kind to a decent vegetarian variety, so to avoid getting bland, ya gotta shop around), and a lack of activity in one's general lifestyle (lack of energy due to lack of proper proteins/passing out all the time like a narcoleptic). This movie was a good expose' on why that lifestyle isn't sustainable for most people, and how our government and the general public were duped (and continue to be) by ""experts"" with an agenda.

  Truthfully, too, the paleo diet proposed by this film is pretty much what I think most people would eat anyway, given the chance, and it's cheaper in the long run to buy the kinds of things that it pushes. Example, today for breakfast me and my spouse ate 2 full strips of bacon and two farm fresh eggs fried in bacon grease. Three hours later, after doing some farm work, we feel fine. We saw the effect the diet had on this man, and we would like similar results.

I don't remember if he was or not. But the point to me is that poor people are sometimes fat in part because McDonald's and grocery food that is cheap is also often high calorie food.

I do wish he could have seen Spulock's food log. But, based on Naughton's own theories - isn't it possible that Spurlock did eat the way he claims and still gained weight?

Be for-warned that if you watch this and have not watched any other fact based food docs, you are probably watching fox networks contribution to food science which in essence says ""everything that happens to you is your fault"" especially if it has to do with food, drugs and Health.

The fast food industry took that little tongue-in-cheek film so seriously that its obvious the film hit a sore spot. Nobody is going to eat Mcdonalds 3 meals a day for a month like Spurlock did.

Even more important, was showing he could lose weight by eating fast food for the same amount of time simply by smart choices, without eating just salads and started walking a bit more. He showed why watching your carbs rather than fat would help you eat healthier, lose weight, feel better, even be more satisfied with what you did eat. He did not lower his carbs to an extreme amount. He kept them around 100g a day, more or less. His health actually improved while eating nothing but fast food during that time.

Yes he eats nothing but fast food for a month. Which he has even admitted is not something you should do and there are much better ways to loose weight. But all he was trying to prove was that we can't blame fast food companies for the obesity rate in the US(which was basically what Super Size Me portrayed).

3723241,5,B001NRY6R2,"The video is a bit campy and low budget, but that doesn't mean the message is.

Whether you like the content of the DVD or not, what Tom is pointing out is how biased everything is when the government wants to push it's agenda. It shows how lobbying, grant money, government departmental budgets, even the media work to promote the dogma of the day.

In the case of food, the government dietary dogma of the past 40 years has been flawed (thank you George McGovern). Wonder why people are fatter now than 40 years ago? Wonder why more kids have ADHD now than 40 years ago? Watch the DVD.

Did you know that there is no such thing as good and bad cholesterol? Cholesterol is cholesterol. LDL and HDL are lipids, components of cholesterol, but are not cholesterol, and there are two different kinds of LDL. One harmless, one harmful. Watch this DVD.

Continuously high cholesterol (which is why fasting is necessary when being tested for it) is a symptom that something is wrong inside your body and needs to be repaired (usually inflammation). High cholesterol by itself doesn't cause inflammation or heart disease, but it can be a symptom that you've got a problem. Lowering your cholesterol won't fix the problem, just give you a false sense of security. That's why cholesterol lowering medications have the disclaimer that their use have not been proven to reduce heart disease. Watch this DVD.

Our bodies know how to handle cholesterol. It knows how to handle natural fats (cocoa butter, coconut oil, cheese, whole milk, olive oil, butter, lard, tallow), but doesn't know how to handle modern fats that didn't exist years ago and that are touted now as healthy, like cottonseed oil, which is in an extraordinary number of processed foods. Do your own research on cottonseed oil and see if you still want to eat it or products that contain it. A nutritionist once told me that she will not eat any food or processed food product that contains fats or oils that didn't exist a century ago. Now I know why. Watch the DVD.

There have been way too many studies that show animal fats and natural plant fats, like olive oil and coconut oil, do not affect your cholesterol level. If you have a health issue, all fats can exacerbate it, but they don't cause it.

Watch the DVD and be enlightened, and remember to question and investigate everything. Human agendas often trample good science. That's what this DVD is trying to say.",1345248000,3,2426,4.694117647058824

3723247,5,B001NRY6R2,"I must admit I almost did not watch this documentary (I watched it on Netflix) and the cheesy music at the beginning didn't help either. I thought it would be a low budget ""look at me I'm funnier than 'Super Size Me'"" kinda thing but it wasn't like that at all. I've always been a documentary fan up until Michael Moore (but I'm not going into that). So when ""Super Size Me"" came out I watched like a lot of people--it was very entertaining. But because I don't eat at McDonald's my thinking was ""that doesn't apply to me"" so I went on my merry way. On to the review:

It gets to the point very quickly. What aren't the nutrition experts not telling us about our diets? Spurlock of Super Size Me did not share his food logs (which clearly should make anyone think, what does this guy have to hide?). Fat Head does all the math for you to make the point. Fat Head interviews several MDs (the Eades who wrote ""Protein Power"") and nutrition experts on high fat (good quality fats like coconut oil and others) to discuss how the US went from an animal based diet (proteins and fats) to a grain based/vegetable fats and proteins diet (i.e., carbohydrate high diet). He also, perhaps most importantly, he discusses bad science--or how our diet and nutrition was influenced by bad science and consequently pushed/supported through government channels.

Lastly, he undergoes a month-long diet change and unlike Spurlock of ""Super Size Me"" he shows you his food log (he also has this posted on his website/blog). If you are not amazed at his weight loss and dramatic change in lipid panel then I don't know what will amaze you.

I was a vegetarian for 12 years. I've always been health conscious. I've never had much of a sweet tooth. I thought I was eating healthy for so many years. But for as long as I was vegetarian I felt miserable. I say all this because I am not a person looking for the holy grail or the next diet fad. I am a person looking for a healthy lifestyle. Regardless of your political beliefs, your religious beliefs or your meat-eating habits; if you are interested in health information and have an open mind, don't miss Fat Head. Overlook the cheesy music, it's the content that matters!",1336089600,13,2201,4.525125628140704
3723248,2,B001NRY6R2,"First, I don't understand why this is billed as a comedy.  It never made me laugh, and I had trouble figuring out what parts were supposed to be funny.  Maybe when they made a Cuckoo sound while showing a picture of Ralph Nader?

There is some good and useful information here, but there is so much condescending attitude, and so many logical fallacies, that it makes it hard to sort through to the good information.  The whole thing is set up as a counterpoint to Super Size Me, yet it mostly presents arguments against claims that were never made in Super Size Me.  It does call some points of that movie into question (and I seriously appreciate the few times that it does so), but they are mostly inconsequential points (honestly, what difference does it make if Spurlock was averaging 5000 calories or not?), and many of the counterarguments Fat Head makes to Spurlock's movie are easily deconstructed.  As one example, Naughton calls into question the year-by-year, state-by-state epidemiological data showing a steady rise in obesity.  He explains this by a point when the term ""obesity"" was re-defined.  If that were remotely correct as an explanation, there would only be a one or two year jump in obesity as the new definition was implemented, yet rates are rising unabated to this day.

The best part of the film is largely a straw man argument (seriously, take a list of logical fallacies and see how many and how fast you can check them off while watching this movie).  Naughton goes to great lengths to demonstrate that certain types of fat are essential for our health (apparently as a strange sort of vindication for fast food).  Nobody disputes this!  They are scientifically known as EFAs: *Essential* Fatty Acids (best sources? seeds & nuts, fish, and green leafy veggies).  There are extremists who argue we should have restricted fat intakes (and Super Size Me never made any such claim), while there are other extremists who argue for restricted carb intakes (such as Naughton and every expert he included in this film).  The fact is, most Americans get too many calories of ALL types - carbs, fats, and proteins.  We need a balance of nutrient-dense, low-calorie foods along with more exercise.  If someone could only make a popular documentary that told us that, we'd all be better off.  This was not that documentary.",1336003200,14,2342,4.829573934837093
3723249,5,B001NRY6R2,"After seeing Super Size Me, I was underwhelmed to say the least.  This guy Spurlock deliberately stuffed his face with a gross surplus of food and then more or less blamed corporations and lobbyists for the problems that resulted.  While I agree that corporations and lobbyists are more interested in serving themselves than the public, I disagree that it is their FAULT when people get fat and sick from an excess of fast food.  Nobody can force you to eat anything you do not willingly buy.  If you still blame others for your diet-related problems despite that very simple fact, then you are more interested in being a victim than taking accountability for your own actions.

Anyway, after seeing Super Size Me, I saw an interview where a person smugly said, ""I've had no interest in going to McDonald's ever since seeing Super Size Me,"" and I really got irritated.  A person makes a sensationalized film about what happens when you make extremely stupid decisions for 90 straight meals, and that turns you off of the occasional fast food burger?  I thought surely there must be a counterdocumentary in which someone loses weight eating fast food, which is quite possible to do if you are not an idiot.

And there I found Fat Head.  I nodded along in complete agreement during the segments in which Naughton criticized Super Size Me and its themes.  But I was absolutely blown away by the dietary information about fats and carbs, which I was not expecting.  Unlike much of the dietary advice out there, Naughton formulated his thesis based on the first hand research and clinical experience of many doctors, who backed up Naughton's arguments on screen and explained how the conventional ""wisdom"" is flawed.

I applied this advice to my own life and lost 20 lbs that I did not even know I could lose (6'0""--formerly 185 lbs, now 165).  On top of the weight loss, I sleep better, feel better, and have more energy at age 29 than I have in my entire life, including my teen years.

It is pretty clear to me where the real science of this dietary debate is.  It is also clear who is willing to respect others' freedom and who else is willing to exceed the boundaries of honesty in order to push an agenda.  Kudos to Tom Naughton for making this film on a shoestring budget.  The information in his film is worth 10 times the information in Super Size Me.",1335916800,,2355,4.622596153846154

There's also a movie you have propably heard of called super size me, where Morgan Spurlock, probably miss-spelled the name, went on a 30 day McDiet and gained 22 pounds. Guess what, you've been fead a load of balonia.

I for one had heard all the above arguments, and watched Super Size Me in health class twice. I knew all the things, but I willingly ignored them, because while I knew ""the facts,"" I just couldn't adheer to them. Then I stumbled upon this gem. I watched it on Netflix and it rocked my world. I found out that there is so much corruption in the health world, that I emidiately re-evaluated what I do with my diet.

I'm a freshman and didn't want to gain the freshman 15, mainly because I put on some weight the previous summer, but with the meal plan, and knowing that I couldn't survive, let alone bare, to eat chicken salads and other low fat things. I would typically eat a burger, fries, and drink a pop with my dinning hall meal, and if I was on the other campus, surving size slice of pizza, bottle of pop, and typically a kit kat. Then I saw how Tom lost weight eating at McDonalds and how what I've been told was balonia. His big thing was cutting pop. I was drinking pop because it was something to drink. I deciced to replace that with water, and at the end of the semester, lost 10 pounds.

You will be suprised to what you will learn from this movie. And if the rocking of the nutrition world isn't enough to convince you to watch this, it's also amazingly entertaining. We all know, or should, that learning is best when it's entertaining. Tom is a professional comedian, so he incorperates a fair amount of humor into this documentary, without being rediculous and undermining his message. Unless you're from CSPI or Morgan Spurlock, I have a feeling you will like this movie, and if not, at least hear a more pleasent message.

Now for such posotive feelings, you might be wondering why I rate only 4 and not 5 stars. If not, I'm going to tell you anyways. The price is outragious. Unless this is a release with all the DVD's available through the Fat Head Movie site, all signed by Tom himself, it is not worth the $80+ the sellers are asking for it, which I highly doubt.

3723257,5,B001NRY6R2,"I;ve been suffering from major constipation since I was a kid. It wasn't so bad at first, but got worse as I got older. Now being 22, it was so bad that I wouldn't be able to get up in the morning without waiting in bed for a few hours so my body would fart out my gasses. Every few months, I would not be able to release my stool for days, and would have major abdominal pains. Was working out, but my stomach pains combined with a shoulder injury made it impossible. My mom's had this problem for most her life as well, so its some sort of genetic condition.

I've went to several doctors to find solutions. Every doctor said to consume loads of fiber (benefiber and fiber pills), cut meat, and eat loads of high-fiber starches and veggies (no fruits, tho...apparently too acidy). Did that for years, and only marginally helped with my stool (gas got worse, tho). I asked about gluten allergy, since I would often feel bloated after eating noodles or similar. The initial allergy test came up negative, and a full test includes a ton of different tests and shots and months for results (didn't do it obviously).

During one of my fartation sessions, I saw Fathead on Netflix. I was on a low-fat, moderate/high starch diet (pasta and whole wheat breads) prior to the film.

So, I started to eat A LOT more full-fat protein, restarted working out, and cut carbs to only fruits and veggies. WOW! After just a few days, its all gone! The pain's away, and my stool comes out instantly (used to wait 20-30 min for all of it to come out). I'm more than energized for my workouts (and these are hard workouts), and feel a lot happier and satisfied. I've also lost weight like Tom did.

Seriously, I feel my life's now at a total 180.

There's something really wrong with the current state of medical affairs if doctors completely ignore possible starch sensitivity and instead prescribe these same diagnosis to the same problems (everyone with stomach problems need fiber). Told my mom about it, but she's skeptical to go completely against her doctor's advice.

Bottom line: Give this film a chance. It doesn't matter whether you're a vegetarian, vegan, or simply are immediately against certain parts of the film (un-demonizing of fast food), because it makes a more important point later on. I'm sure I am not the only person whose suffered from a similar situation in which the doctor suggested high fiber diets do diddly squat, or low-fat diets for high cholesterol for something that's innocuous.",1331769600,13,2496,4.648526077097506

3723261,2,B001NRY6R2,"I watched this movie as well as Super Size Me several times and I am in full agreement that Morgan Spurlock has some explaining to do with regard to his actual diet for the entire month that he ate at McDonalds.  That much I agree with.

The problem I have with this movie is that it wasn't just about disproving Morgan Spurlock.  Tom Naughton gets into heart-attacks and cholesterol as well, and despite insulting vegetarians and vegans, doesn't have any scientific or medical evidence showing the before and after results of what happens to someone's arteries on either a vegan or a ""regular American diet"".  Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn would have ripped the comments made in this movie to shreds by these other doctors who say that eating more animal fat doesn't increase your chances of getting a heart attack.  Our cholesterol should be below 150 (American scale) in order to prevent heart attacks.  150 to 200 is not low cholesterol.  Getting a heart attack with 156 cholesterol isn't a surprise.  And last time I checked, the meat and dairy industry is heavily subsidized by the U.S. government.  Trans fats and vegetable oils are bad for you too but just criticizing the grain industry and not saying anything about the meat and dairy industry came across to me as a little bit biased.  Refined foods are not good for you but there is nothing wrong with eating unmodified potatoes and rice.  Carbohydrates don't kill people.  Modified foods, unnatural foods and too much cholesterol kill people.  Our bodies produce all the cholesterol it needs.  Nothing wrong with eating meat in moderation just as there is nothing wrong with drinking alcohol in moderation.

To give a personal experience on eating the R.A.V.E. diet (no refined foods, no animal products, no vegetable oils, exercise) for one and a half years, I went from a cholesterol of 5 point something to 2 point something (Canadian scale) and I was working in construction and was able to keep my strength and not get depressed like Tom Naughton claims he did when he avoided eating too much fat.  My doctor didn't believe me when I told him that it was my diet alone that caused the drop in my cholesterol and I was able to once again run up three flights of steps without getting a severe loss of breath or heaviness in my chest and I felt great for the first time in my life since I was a kid.  If eating potatoes and whole grain rice all the time was going to turn me into a fat diabetic with inflamed arteries and put me in a high risk category for insulin resistance and heart disease like this movie implies, then I should be feeling a lot worse by now.",1324512000,3,2622,4.616379310344827

3723264,3,B001NRY6R2,"I watched this and found it to be rather interesting overall. I was surprised that Morgan Spurlock refuses to release any food diaries from when he gained a bunch of weight and lost his health eating only at McDonalds. Most food that you can purchase at McD's is not very healthy. But Spurlock's documentary was over the top in that you would have to stuff your face until you were ready to puke in order to gain 25 pounds in a single month, even eating pure junk. Also, that it took him 14 months to lose the weight on a vegan diet was pretty sad as after a huge weight gain like that it should be rather easy to lose the first 10 pounds in a couple of months of eating healthy as at least a few pounds of the weight gain was pure water weight gain from massive sodium increases.

Overall I thought Naughton's coverage was effective in showing the BS shown in Supersize me, like the way you cannot put together any combination of meals on the menu even with supersizing and desert and reach 5000 calories, the closest was around 4800, yet Spurlock claimed all of his meals AVERAGED 5000 calories. Clearly, Spurlock was being intentionally deceitful.

The main issues I found with Fat Head was Naughton's claim that obesity rates were overstated because he could go out and not see enough obese people to match the stats. Well, I can go out some places and see a higher percenatage of obese people than stats say I should a lot of times. When I go dine in Roanoke nearby, the number of extremely obese people is literally shocking some nights as almost half the people coming in and out at the restaurant I frequent are flat out REALLY FAT, and they are usually ordering the highest calorie items on the menu. But stats are not meant to be general observations. They are taken by researchers who get specifics, so Naughton's rebuttal based on his observations on the sidewalk was just ludicrous and disingenuous.

Also, Naughton seemed to be against the concept of restaurants being forced to give consumers the nutritional facts of the food they serve by stating that bookstores in the airports and also libraries have calorie counting books available. I agree that the information on calories is available out there, but if the restaurants already know the information, I don't see any reason they shouldn't be forced to provide the info INSIDE of their establishments so consumers who want to can make better choices. Most people know that restaurants often provide items that sound healthy on the menu and then you look it up and its LOADED with high calories. Yes, some will ignore the info anyway and still overeat and get fat. But I don't see any honest or ethical reason see the fast food restaurants want this information kept out of their establishments as they have been spending $millions$ in lobbying and legal fees trying to prevent every effort to do this. To me, that means they've done their research and analysis and believe they stand to lose a lot more than a few million in lost profits if people who care about what they put in their mouth actually understand what they are eating when dining out. Its this kind of intentional blocking of distributing nutrition facts that makes me stand on the side of government over business, something I do rarely do. Obamacare is a massive pile of crap legislation, but forcing restaurants to do this was at least good thing to come out of it. It was only 10-15 years ago that packaged food manufacturers were finally forced to provide nutritional information, something they also fought very hard.

My favorite part of this was that Naughton at least covered the fact that low fat diets are not the most healthy way to eat, and that fat is something humans have been eating a lot of since our early ancestors. Carbohydrates are one of the biggest problems in America, mostly that people eat TONS of carbs. Carbs are not evil, but overindulgence in carbs will definitely make you fat and lead to insulin issues. I personally follow a reduced carb diet lifestyle and have seen tremendous benefits. However, it would have been nice to at least see a couple of counterpoint interviews. The fact that it didn't makes this just an average ""documentary"" that is really produced to sell the author/producer's point of view rather than engage in a 2 sided discussion where the author/producer could still make their own view more prominent and likely more effective showing it in contrast to the opposing view. That is where this movie fails on being straightforward.

Overall, I would recommend watching it and you can make your own judgements.",1317427200,7,4597,4.698511166253102
3723265,5,B001NRY6R2,"You gotta wonder why these neo-leftist food police are so hell-bent on taking down McDonald's and to turn our great country into a nanny-state, relying on the government to tell us what and how to eat. Even though Morgan Spurlock's 'Super Size Me' was a travesty loaded with falsehoods and lies, people swallowed his asinine propaganda like salt water taffy. Spurlock inflated his calorie intake to 5,000 which was proven in FATHEAD to be impossible with what he was eating (or claiming to eat). Not surprisingly, he refuses to hand over his food logs. Even funnier, you see these pathetic clowns crying and whining about the boogeyman corporations and how McD's spends billions on advertising. These clowns seem to forget McDs earned its massive profits by selling their product to people who CHOSE to eat it. They never forced anybody to go there and eat. I've been to hundreds of McDs and never once did an employee stick a gun in my face and force me to eat. They earned their money, they have every right to spend their profits on advertising! What is so hard about this basic concept?  Just because a few people are too weak to resist the sweet-and-sour sauce and Big Macs shown in the TV commercials, magazine ads, and billboards doesn't mean we all are. I, for one, am a grown man and decide what goes in and out of my body.

So why did McDs take away their SuperSized options? Because they foolishly caved to pressure by the nanny-state proponents. According to the food police pigs like Spurlock, McD's SuperSize options were just too much to resist. To the food police, saying ""no thanks"" when an employee asks if you'd like your meal super sized is just too difficult. NEWSFLASH:  McD's can sell deep fried butter sticks if they want. If you don't want it, then don't order it! See how easy that is?

FATHEAD not only exposes the lies and BS spewed by the likes of Spurlock the anti-McDonald's weaklings who have lost the ability to say ''no thanks'' when someone offers them a Super-Sized meal, it shows the REAL REASON why people gain weight. In reality, snacks in between meals are alot bigger culprit than fast food.

I'd give this movie TEN stars if I could!

If you've seen ""Supersize Me!,"" you MUST see this movie. ""Fat Head,"" the movie, offers real science. Also, it does it without barfing. And, Tom (Our Hero) loses weight, and lowers cholesterol and overall bodyfat after one month of eating fast food! Of course, this astounds his doctor, who is shown confirming all of these losses in the film.

What's behind all this? Tom Noughton, the independent writer/producer/director/eater of the film, was considering a project about the diet habits of Americans and our obese-ness as a society. (Actually, only so if we go by US Gov't BMI statistics, which would have shown Ahnolt the Terminator to be obese the years he won Mr. Everything Muscly.) Anyway, while doing research, Tom viewed ""Supersize Me!"" and came away doubting that it was all completely true.

He decided to do just about the same thing that Morgan Spurlock did in ""Supersize,"" with only a couple of adjustments. He would eat every meal at a fast food restaurant for a month, but he would not voluntarily gorge himself by robotically agreeing to buy ""fries with that,"" or ""supersizing, maximizing,"" or otherwising the carbohydrate (sugar, starch, white flour) ""extras"" he was offered. Also, he normally removed half the bun from his breakfast sandwiches and cheeseburgers, rejected fries, and only drank diet soft drinks and tea. He kept a complete record of everything he ate, and published it online (at his blog site [...] which is something nobody has been able to get Spurlock to do.

Noughton lost pounds while eating fast food, lowered his blood pressure, and lost body fat.

And guess what: MY FAMILY HAS DONE EXACTLY THE SAME THING!!! IN ONE MONTH!!!  Ten pounds off me, three pounds off my daughter, and ten pounds off my wife (who has been trying for two years to lose ten pounds.) Nope, it ain't a diet. Nope, it ain't starvation. It's just the same thing Our Hero Tom did in his movie, which you will probably not believe: We INCREASED saturated and animal fats in our diets, CUT CARBS to 50 to 100g per day, kept daily calories at about 2000 or less, did not exercise additionally, and enjoyed every minute of the nice long-lasting satisfied feeling a small meal provides when it's not made up of a third of the government-suggested 300g of carbs per day. Also, my blood pressure is down. We all feel great.

This is the best non-diet eating thing I have ever discovered, and I can once again cook with coconut oil!

The info in movie could improve the health and eating habits of MILLIONS of Americans. It has already done it for MY family!

Watch the movie! Not only is it good for you, it's genuinely entertaining!

That's my story and I'm stickin' to it!

3723277,5,B001NRY6R2,"I thought this was a great follow up to ""Super Size Me"" (which I also found interesting in a slanted agenda kind way). Fathead debunks the evils of fast food. Even proving that its possible to lose weight while eating fast food. I tried fast food for about 3 days. Yuk! I really enjoyed the interviews in the bonus section. Highly informative. Not only did I find Fathead very informative but funny as well. I laughed out loud several times. Who thought such a dry subject as nutrition could be so entertaining? I liked Gary Taubes GCBC and Why We Get Fat, but his writing style can be kind of sleep inducing at times. Love the cholesterol, sugar and insulin animation. And CSPI guy! The absolute best part was getting my husband to watch it and agree with it! Hes been on the boring low fat bandwagon for years.

3723278,4,B001NRY6R2,"This film exposes ""Supersize Me"" for what it really is: a complete lie with an underlying goal to push a certain agenda, namely, militant veganism. Fat Head must be required viewing for every American. It should be distributed to every school and every household, in particular to those folks who continue to eat ""healthy, low-fat"" foods and run on their treadmills day after day and wonder why their waistlines aren't getting any smaller. Well, stop wondering and watch this movie. It'll make you laugh and shake your head in disbelief, but in the end it'll likely make you angry, because the fact of the matter is: everything you've been told about nutrition and ""obesity epidemic"" is a lie. It's bad enough that our government is lying to us, the really bad part is that it's poisoning us.

As this movie demonstrates, the statements made by the government about the ""healthy"" diet are completely bereft of science, or are based on severely skewed and manipulated scientific data. The foods that are good for us are being demonized, while the foods we've been led to believe are ""good for us"" are the very foods that are causing our health problems. And at the root of it all, but of course, is money. It's maddening.

The critics of this movie state that it's not ""scientifically accurate"" and that it claims fast food is good for you. Come again? I fail to see how that's the case, considering Naughton mentions several times that fast food is not good for you. I fail to see how one can disprove the science presented in this movie. None of the negative reviews even address it. And last but not least, I fail to see how one can justify the fact that Spurlock outright lied in ""Supersize Me"" (and this movie proves his lies with ease).

The main reason I know this movie speaks the truth? My personal experience. Like many Americans, I'd spent years feeling sluggish, unable to concentrate, ever-hungry, and neurotic about food while working my butt off at the gym 5 days a week and thinking I was eating ""healthy"". It wasn't until I went back to the diet I ate as a child growing up in Eastern Europe - home cooked meals full of good fats, animal protein, vegetables, some tubers, some fruits, and very limited bread, dairy, and sugar - that I saw my health improve (I should also mention that part of it was quitting the chronic cardio insanity, but that's a whole different can of worms). It improved further once I cut out all grains and sugars and limited my intake of dairy. And I'm not alone. Millions of people have lost weight and improved their health by going against ""conventional wisdom"". You don't have to go far to find them.

The reason this isn't a five star movie for me is because I don't feel fast food makes the best example for weight loss and healthier living. I wonder how many people will watch this and believe it's OK to eat at McDonald's every single day as long as you only eat the meat and the veggies and omit the bun, the fries, and the soda. Not so. Yes, healthy fats are good for you, and refined carbs and sugars are bad for you, but a burger patty made from grass-fed beef and cooked in good fat is worlds apart from McDonald's chemical-treated, grain-fed patties fried in canola/soybean oil. A fresh, organic tomato you find at a farmers' market is worlds apart from a store-bought tomato that's been treated with pesticides and spent weeks sitting in a warehouse. I feel the movie should've made more of an emphasis on eating clean, unprocessed, home-cooked foods.

I also recommend two books as a follow up to this: Rob Wolff's ""The Paleo Solution"" and Lierre Keith's ""The Vegetarian Myth"". They may just change your life.",1309651200,5,3667,4.618098159509202

For example he claims putting nutrition facts directly on food packaging will have no effect on whether or not people will continue to eat high calorie foods. How does he prove it? He asks a skinny guy on the street if he'd stop eating the fries if he knew they were 400 calories. The skinny guy says ""no"".

It is our choice to eat crap like McDonald's and he's right about that. But claiming commercial ads, marketing, etc... doesn't influence people to buy this stuff is ridiculous. Fast food joints wouldn't advertise if it didn't increase sales. I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm saying the movie is silly for claiming marketing isn't the reason people go to these places.

The problems that I have with this horrible film is all about the presentation. Our narrator/film maker is a whinny self righteous suburbanite talking down to me then entire film. To be convincing, I have to like you, Tom failed right from the start. The writing is substandard, the facts are thin, any arguments from the 'experts' are at best, a reach and very very poorly threaded together. I could have dealt with the home-made aspects of the film if it was worth watching, but the crummy camera work just grated on me. Sadly the only reasoning that I can see for Tom Naughton to make this movie is not an altruistic effort on his part to make my life better, it seems that for him he just wanted to make a movie to say that Super Size Me was stupid.

This movie is not worth any one's time.",1306022400,22,956,4.281767955801105
3723284,5,B001NRY6R2,"Yes, Tom Naughton's Fat Head despite being hilarious, is also more than a bit depressing when you come to the realization about half way through the movie that for the last 50 some odd years we have been lied to about the so-called ""Food Pyramid"" with it's heavy emphasis on grains and other carbohydrates as well as low-fat in general in response to biochemist Ancel Keys ""Lipid hypothesis"" that made the claim that heart disease was the result of saturated fats and cholesterol.

What is more shocking and depressing is that Keys, someone who should have been rigorously following up his observations with good clinical studies, instead decided that in order to get published, he was going to ignore most of the data that showed virtually no connection between saturated fats and cholesterol and heart disease from 22 countries where there was reliable data. He only took 7 of those countries to make a false statistical increase in heart disease with relation to consumption of saturated fats.

Fast-forward nearly two decades later to the McGovern Report which codified this bogus hypothesis into what we now call the ""Food Pyramid"", with the aforementioned emphasis on low-fat and high carbohydrates, and all despite the objections from numerous scientists. However, instead of seeing a decrease in heart disease 2 decades later, it has actually skyrocketed along with other diseases such as obesity, cancer, and diabetes!

Tom explains all this simply in a way that anyone can understand, along with a great deal of fun humor in nearly all the examples, including the Ansel Keys story, using a series of gut-bustingly funny Monty Python-esque cartoons, real press conference footage, and extensive interviews with biochemists and dietitian's to explain the whole mess.

Among the best moments from the movie are the ""Guy from CSPI"" segments, which detail the sordid history of how the Center for Science in the Public's Interest (CSPI), a vegan/vegetarian group with a radical agenda, forced McDonalds and other fast food restaurants to give up using tallow (read saturated animal fat)to cook foods, and having the government regulate them into using ""healthy"" alternatives like transfatty-laced cooking oils, which actually were far worse from a health standpoint! CSPI turned around years later when transfats were implicated in many health problems to hypocritically say that transfats were bad and the fast food and movie theater industry needed to switch yet again! A similar situation is referred with regards to the popcorn used in movie theaters. From a cartoon in one of these segments comes the movies greatest line ""Because you're EVIL, and you're STUPID! as the skinny vegan CSPI mascot in his red long johns and sandals sticks his nose in other people's business and forces a McDonalds restaurant to double the prices on cheeseburgers, while at the same time making them offer a range of tofu and veggies snacks at heavily subsidized lower prices and driving away a frustrated customer (who just happens to bear a wee resemblance to Tom). Every time there is a CSPI segement, the CSPI Guy is sure to follow!

Yes, certain left-wing socialist do-gooders and the vegetarian/vegan crowd are going to hate this movie. Their sacred cows (no pun intended, I assure you), take quite a beating in Tom's unabashedly pro-Libertarianism, pro-self responsibility, and pro-Paleo diet stance. But unlike many of those he criticizes, especially Morgan Spurlock of Supersize me, Tom at least goes into great detail documenting the science behind what he is talking about and is open about what he ate on his diet (Tom's food logs are available on his website for all to see), and how his choices impacted his weight loss.

So it's not terribly surprising to see the hate reviews here from obvious left-wingers and vegans. Ignore them, watch this movie, then get your family and friends to watch it.

3723291,2,B001NRY6R2,"With ""Fathead"" Tom Naughton tries to present a clever, rational, and unambiguous response to the somewhat controversial ""Supersize Me"" documentary. Naughton's premise is not only that fast food is not a health hazard, but that, in fact, all modern nutritional health information is (as he frequently puts it) ""baloney.""

I don't intend to defend ""Supersize Me"" which was outlandishly biased and questionably informative.  In fact, ""Supersize Me"" and Morgan Spurlock most definitely had an agenda to sell, and the premise that fast food is the single cause of obesity in the nation simply begs for a response.  The problem is, ""Fathead"" is the exact same agenda-driven piece of propaganda, only from the other side.

The biggest problem with this so-called documentary is that Naughton uses it as a launchingpad for standard right-wing propaganda (frequently taking the form of sardonic mocking and childish insults directed at any liberal or seemingly left-wing public service organization) under the guise of common sense and clarity, while being guilty of exactly the same thing he accused others: bias and distortion.

As a means of presenting his common sense case, he trots out a series of supposed experts, all wearing standard white lab coats (so you know they're legit), usually seated in front of a lot of books (so you know they are serious), and with plenty of letters after their names (so you know they're like really smart and stuff). Unfortunately, we are never given these experts' bona-fides, and simply have to trust the fact that they are respected and accepted by the scientific community at large.  And, in fact, many of these experts hail from groups or backgrounds as questionable as those he ridicules. For example, Naughton takes tremendous (and very deserved) glee in mocking the CSPI - a group that deserves as much scorn and ridicule as it can get.  The problem is, while Naughton delights in lampooning the CSPI, he fails to mention that one of the most prominent figures he uses to legitimize his stance, Dr. Al Sears, is a sleazy snake-oil huckster, peddling some sort of CoQ-10 miracle pill sold under the label Primal Force.  Or that the Weston A. Price Foundation (who Naughton uses to support his questionable nutritional dogma) is accused of repeatedly presenting misinformation regarding nutrition.

Another area in which Naughton really seems to lose credibility is how he implicates Government agencies like the FDA and the CDC in some bizarre consipiracy in which Mega Agri-Business controls the purse strings of the grant money used to buy the scientists in order to continue to keep the money flowing.  I mean, it's one thing to question data and conclusions, but I think even the most jaded of people would have a hard time believing the CDC or FDA are a shadow money laundering front for big corporations.

Lost in this morass of anti-government paranoia, liberal-bashing, and low-level insults are some really important points.  Such as question of whether the current nutritional guidelines need reformation, or what really is behind the problem of Americans getting fatter.  Well, scratch that last one, because according to Naughton, Americans aren't actually getting fatter at all, it's just that we're being told we're fatter.

And it's things like that last bit that just put a cap on the entire hypocrisy problem with ""Fathead.""  While Naughton rightly dismisses the faulty conclusion of ""Supersize Me"" that fast food is the cause of obesity, he goes on to put forth the idea that fast food is somehow as healthy for you as a home cooked meal made from fresh food.  And, as Naughton would say, that's just a load of baloney.  Yet he pitches it and even offers some weight loss at the end of his 30 days as proof.  However, just as Naughton highlighted the fact that Spurlock's 5,000 kcal/day diet wasn't normal, he employs the same sleight-of-hand by not really saying that his increased exercise regimen (going from walking three days a week to six), and strict caloric intake limits (below 2000 kcal per day) is also not normal.  Most Americans - particularly those who include a significant amount of fast food in their diets - exceed their recommended daily caloric intake and fail to exercise.  Of course Naughton lost weight!  It's not because of the fast food, but in spite of it.  To be fair, Naughton does mention at a few points that excercise and activity are a factor in maintaining a healthy weight, but he never admits that fast food, while not the exclusive cause of obesity and poor health, is also a contributing factor.  In fact, one could easily come away with the conclusion that Naughton is actually advocating for fast food as a healthy nutritional option.

Yet while touting the nutritional benefits of fast food, he never once touches on the danger of processed meat, such as: the widespread use of bleach in the processing to destroy bacteria and contaminants; the addition of chemicals in the form of food coloring, flavoring, and preservatives;  or the excessive amount of salt and by-products that goes into a burger.

It's clear that Naugton's conclusions are based on very incomplete (or, selective) data  - sort of what he accuses others of doing.

If Naughton really wanted to be taken seriously in his premise that fast food is healthier than fresh food, he should have tried offering at least some level of balance. Instead, he totally Fox News-ed it, using his dismissive and patronizing attitude to mock or insult anyone who believes a high-fat junk food diet isn't a good idea, while allowing spurious mouthpieces and questionable ""experts"" a soapbox from which to spread their beliefs. Would it really have been that difficult to at least present one or two dissenting points of view withut resorting to grade-school put-downs and insults? It's really too bad, because what this amounts to is that ""Fathead"" and Naughton are just as much a machine for false information presented as truth as Spurlock and ""Supersize Me"" is.",1302220800,27,6013,4.997995991983968

Both movies are biased, yes, but they have to be to make their points because they are done by human beings who are passionate about their subjects and have a goal in mind they are aiming to persuade you in.  The point is, that using simple graphics and low-budget affects along with simple Math and reasoning, we all draw the simple conclusion the author wants you to:  you are allowed to do what you want to do with your life.  You can waste it as a ""fat"" person or you can decide to change it.  But, you should educate yourself and make sure you get regular check-ups.  I loved that he ended up using coconut oil to fry his food.  That told me he had definitely educated himself about the good fats versus bad, processed and unhealthy fats.

It amazes how far from commonsense science on health and nutrition has come in order to create foods that generate profit and keep others who cannot afford to, from eating the very way they should. I recommend Food, Inc. and a few other movies also for being eye-opening and very unique on this topic as well.

I would recommend Super Size Me, but it's obvious that McDonald's is far from the only culprit. For every person who refuses McDonald's but splurges daily or even several times weekly on the fattest caloric drinks of Starbucks, this too could be an issue depending on one's insulin issues, bmi and other factors.

3723295,4,B001NRY6R2,"Some background on myself and my experiences before I review this: I'm 22, male, used to be overweight. I jumped from diet to diet misguided by my ""research"" that came from the USDA and other bureaucratic organizations promoting the agricultural commodities and vegan agenda. Finally, I am fit because I ultimately discovered the right dieting mix that emphasizes lots of protein (which comes with fat) along with fruits and vegetables. I try to avoid grains and starches, and I feel a ton better because of it. Bran, granola, and other ""healthy low-fat"" foods made me sick as a dog, overweight, and drained of energy. Despite careful deliberate dieting, I kept failing to my frustration because I was grossly misinformed.

It seems political correction has plagued our society on every level. Diets have become a subject overrun by PC advocates. ""Animal fats are bad... why would you want to eat animals anyway?!?! McDonald's and other fast food organizations are bad... they make our children fat. Eat grains, soybeans, and bran. They're good for you and will help you lose weight!!!"" Even if we don't believe such statements, it finds its way into our subconscious which is what the bureaucrats want. And when we follow these suggestions on a whole as society, we suddenly have epidemics of diabetes, obesity, depression, and other disorders. It's obvious the vegan-inspired pro-grain diet has failed and made things worse. The bureaucrats had to find a way to divert blame: direct hatred and blame towards fast food and continue to promote the pro-grain pro-vegan agenda. Fast food is by no means the healthiest food choice out there, but it cannot be held responsible for the obesity epidemic. It's a widespread misconception: fat=unhealthy, skinny= healthy. That cannot be farther from the truth. Thin people have heart problems if their diet sucks just like a fat person. Heart disease is not tied to obesity either.

There are far greater evils contributing to the obesity problem: sedentary lifestyles, grain/starch-based diets, misinformation provided to the public... blaming fast food for obesity is like blaming Canada for the Cold War. The relationship does not make so much sense when there are obvious culprits elsewhere that we are trained to overlook. This guy did after all lose a significant amount of weight eating at McDonald's... so while McDonald's may not be ""healthy"" it cannot be blamed for obesity. One must also consider that when he ate at McDonald's, he avoided carbohydrates and sugars (getting a hamburger with no bun, for example, and avoiding the fries). He aimed at ordering high fat/protein, low-carb options on the McDonald's menu. In other words, we only get fat at McDonald's when we support the agricultural commodity products that come from wheat and potatoes, which the USDA encourages us to consume heavily.

It's sickening that politicians will go to such extremes to misguide us and lead us off a cliff. In a hypocritical manner, they will blame corporations for being greedy at the expense of the public when in fact they are the ones trying to channel funds towards themselves and their cronies, while screwing the misguided public and feeding them myths.

This guy makes some very strong points. He can be strange at times... his humor can be a little corny. But it's impossible to ignore his analysis and arguments. I recommend viewing this because it may change your perspective on why we never win the obesity fight.

***UPDATE*** September 2011

I've been refining my diet a little bit and I want to share some new information. This past month I finally made a decision to completely remove ALL grains and refined sugar from my diet: no wheat, rice, bran, quinoa, sugar, etc. My only sources of carbs: blueberries, carrots, spinach, and broccoli... and some fruit here and there too. I also ate about three eggs each day cooked in butter each morning, and that keeps me from being hungry for five hours. For my 2pm lunch and 6pm dinner, I would eat a turkey burger wrapped in lettuce, spinach, tomato, and onions with some cheese. Some days I would have zucchini spaghetti with marinara and mozzarella. My caloric intake was surprisingly low despite my fat intake; about 1600 calories but I was never hungry.

My results were fantastic! Even though I ate no cereal, sugar, or ""healthy"" grain carbs, I had steady energy levels that did not bounce and crash. Critics say Atkins dieters crash a lot, but I think this is only because Atkins dieters forget to eat carbs in the form of blueberries, broccoli, carrots, and other low glycemic vegetables and fruits. I am doing a hardcore plyometric 2-month workout program called Insanity and I have more than enough energy to push through. I lost 8 pounds in just three and a half weeks. My body fat is dropping, and finally I am getting a noticeable six pack. I've been breaking all the politically correct rules of dieting, and it is paying off amazingly.

To summarize my advice, BE COMMITTED! You can't eat what you are supposed to eat WHILE eating what you're NOT supposed to eat. This diet is not an excuse to go all out and eat steak and eggs WHILE eating sugary crap. This takes work, and the ""Fat Head"" diet is not easy. I realized sugar and starches are like crack. They are addicting because they give short boosts of energy and when you crash, you want more. It takes a good week or two before the sugary Starbucks drinks or sodas look unappealing. I can't drink soda or sugary coffee anymore, it just doesn't taste good as it used to (black coffee is a great-tasting drink once you acquire the palette for it). When you get to that point, you will know you're eating right. You'll probably have to go cold turkey on the sugary crap. You're body will learn it does not like it.

You have to exercise in some form too. Our body is not designed to be sedentary for an entire day.

My last tip: Be sensible. Don't go crazy on the fat and use it as an excuse. Still monitor your calories and don't eat half a pound of cheddar cheese a day along with eight eggs. You might also find some foods are not for you. For example, soft cheeses make me gain weight. It's probably because the sodium makes me retain water, so I just don't eat it (there's little nutritional value in soft cheeses anyway). Butter, eggs, and almonds however, no problem! Buy a scale and measure your progress on a daily basis. Trends over just three days can give you early warning that what you are eating may not be working.

And finally, my disclaimer: This has worked for me, I don't know if this will work for everybody. I can't say one shoe size fits all, but if every other diet has failed you might want to give the ""Fat Head"" diet a chance.",1300060800,58,6724,4.768041237113402

3723301,5,B001NRY6R2,"First, the movie is very well done.  Its a fun movie to watch, its well presented, and not a boring lecture.
For entertainment it's an easy 5 star movie.

In addition, the writer points out a number of flaws in the ducumentary SuperSize Me.  He also points out flaws in views espoused by some groups, the media, and the government.  Things like exagerations, and spotty research.

1. People don't get enough exercise.  Exercise dosn't have to be going to the gym, it can consist of walking instead of taking the car/bus.

2. People have a brain and need to count calories and take responsibility for their eating habits and weight.  I like Doritos and Chocolate chip cookies.  I might eat them once a month.  I love pizza, and may eat it once a week.

3. Its important to eat fruits and vegetables.  There is something to be said for not eating a lot of processed foods (white bread, sugar, cookies, frosted flakes, etc).

The point I will argue is I think the writer and his team of experts also had their own political agenda.  I don't think its OK to eat a lot of meat.  Not in the long run.  People 250,000 years ago worried about starvation, and ate whatever they could get.  They also died before ago 40.  So they didn't live long enough to die from cancer or heart disease.  I think eating a lot of high fat food, for a long time, is generally unhealty.  It also depends on the type of food eaten - eating unpolluted free range Salmon is a lot healthier than eating hamburgers and hot dogs.

My only complaint is I think this documentary advocates eating more fatty meat than is healty.  And it has it's own political agenda, it's not unbiased research.  I would not trust all that his self selected experts say.

For him to lose 12 pounds in a month is uspicious.  Try doing that yourself.
Try losing 3 poinds in one week.  Inthe movie he is sticking to a 2,000 calorie a day diet.  To lose 3 pounds means you need to run a caloric deficit of aproximately 3600*3 = 10,800 calories.  10,800/7 = or around 1,500 calories per day.  Assuming a middle age man at 5'11"" 206  needs 2,500 calories a day to maintain his weight.
This implies he did 1,000 calories of exercise every day for 30 days.

I can tell you from experience that that's a lot, unless one works out a high intensity.  It would take him 90 - 120 minutes of exercise a day to burn that, and maybe throw in some walking too.
He did not say anything about that level of exercise.  If he did, then I would attribute that to his drop in ""bad"" Cholesteral.  Doing 90-120 minute sof cardio in 2 sessions will absoluetley help you blood fat levels.

While the movie is entertaining, I would not agree to tits conclusions.  Yes - other studies and views are deeply flawed.  And No - eating a lot of meat is not healty.",1299542400,4,2779,4.367906066536204

But the film also suffers from an annoying right wing critique of the ""nanny state"" and a fairly incoherent rebuttal to Morgan Spurlock's Supersize Me.

The film initially documents a counter-experiment, in which Naughton spends nearly a month eating nothing but fast food, but limiting his intake to 2000 calories per day, which (for him) sets up a caloric deficit.  He loses 12 pounds and thus proves that it is possible to lose weight while eating junk food.  But he then reveals that in addition to holding down his caloric intake, he also avoided menu items with carbs and sugars, and then the film becomes all about the theories of carbs, sugars and the glycemic index.

So the better experiment would have been to compare results of a 2000 calorie intake, both with and without low carb consumption in the calorie total.

Throughout the documentary, Naughton argues an anti-government narrative that links together ""big government,"" research institutions that manipulate data to attract and preserve funding, agricultural business interests, and radical vegetarians, as the coalition behind decades of medical mis-information and dis-information.  He may or may not be right on the historical legacy, but his naked contempt toward government and the medical establishment is off-putting and often feels stretched.  Occasionally the statements are downright bizarre, such as when he attributes higher rates of obesity among the poor to a genetic predisposition among minorities toward ""thickness.""

Much of the movie is constructed out of dialog by famous names in the low carb universe discussing their alternative views and critiquing the motives of the government and the medical establishment.  There are no interviews of any persons who defend the science behind the conventional wisdom.  And of course virtually all of the low carb people have books on the market about diet and weight loss, as well as other direct commercial interests in the debate.  He includes a writer from ""Reason"" magazine (a libertarian publication) alongside the doctors and researchers, which again overly politicizes (and thereby partially undermines) the biological arguments at the core of the film.

The film is rambling and redundant in some places, and in other spots it feels as though technical information is presented in a somewhat rushed fashion.  Many other food documentaries (like King Corn) organize their material in a far more linear and compelling fashion.  Although Naughton attempts to integrate humor into the mix, we can plainly see why he abandoned stand-up comedy in favor of writing software code.

Having already looked into this whole subject at some length, my own conclusion is that the conventional wisdom IS flawed, and that our understanding has a long way to go.  I hoped that Fat Head would do a better job of presenting that case than it does.  Advocating for saturated fats in a balanced diet does not require that Naughton minimize and rationalize the increase in obesity, or blame it on school children undergoing forced busing (?) and getting rides home from school.  Likewise, whether one is a believer in low carb & sugar OR low fat, one is wise to keep fast food consumption minimal, since a typical hamburger-fries-soda combination is adverse to the goals of BOTH diets and his defense of the fast food industry is not really harmonious with the dietary theory he presents.

Fat Head is at its best when it puts aside a defense of the ""liberty"" to eat fast food and the ""liberty"" of fast food providers to not provide nutritional information in a more prominent way, and instead keeps the focus on the alternative science surrounding fat, carbs, and sugars.  If this argument is completely new to you, the film will provide a good informational starting point (hence my three stars) but along the way expect to put up with a libertarian comedian-turned-computer programmer who is not very good at comedy, not very good at building a linear argument, and not very good at documentary film-making.",1299283200,68,4229,5.1088534107402035
3723303,2,B001NRY6R2,"The main reason I was interested in watching this was because of the challenge on Supersize Me. He made some points that I agree with, such as it being a choice to consume fast food, and that fast food doesn't necessarily make you fat. The main difference between each of these documentaries is that Supersize Me takes a liberal viewpoint, thinking that the government or some other entity is somehow responsible for your health, while Fathead takes a conservative viewpoint because he says that it is a personal responsibility to care for yourself, not the government's or anyone elses. In fact, he even basically sounds like he is anti government. His points that he made about Morgan Spurlock's math being wrong were definitely worth something, but unfortunately the vast majority of the public does not know this. The rest of the film was full of problems. I really wanted to like the movie and agree with it, being a big believer in self responsibility, but many things stood out to me, such as:

1. From the very beginning of the film when he says that it took him ""hours"" to film all of these obese people, so there must not really be that big of an obesity problem. He also later says that there really isn't an obesity problem, but that definition of obesity changed. I agree that some people are wrongfully classified as overweight or obese, and something needs to change there. But the idea that he obesity problem is not that bad is ludicrous. I see more obese people that what he filmed in ""hours"" just merely by going grocery shopping. I also see many young children that are obese. He also mentioned that black and hispanic people tend to be ""thicker,"" and that part of this whole obesity epidemic is white people just not accepting that they have different body types. Excuse me, but I am aware that there are differences in body types, what does that have to do with obesity? If someone is very obese, it doesn't matter what race they are, they are obese. Most black and hispanic people may be ""thicker"" on average, but they aren't obese. The obesity problem isn't white people not accepting other races, it is rather obvious from looking around that there are plenty of obese white people. The film made it sound as if thin white women had some sort of personal vendetta against other races being different, and this is yet another reason why the obesity problem is being blown out of proportion.

2. He contradicts himself because he emphasizes that the obesity problem isn't that bad, but then goes into detail about everything wrong with public schools and kids these days. I agree that kids need more physical activity and are overmedicated, but apparently he has a problem with kids eating school lunches and not walking home. Oh and school buses are bad too.

3. The part of about the lipid hypothesis being wrong was good, but his evidence of how the human diet is supposed to work is very lacking. He gets all of his information from ""Protein Power"" and other low carb diets pushers. I agree that humans weren't meant to eat most of what we eat, including eating too many grains. But the idea that simply eating any grains at all is like eating sugar is too far fetched and not believable. He seems to think that by merely not eating grains and eating any amount of unhealthy processed meats and animal products, he'll be in perfect health. He is leaving out the entire issue of hormones antibiotics, etc, being put into these animal products and how they may affect health. Our ancestors did not eat factory farmed grain fed beef or other factory farmed animal products, but somehow he thinks this is not relevant at all. Sorry to break it to you, but when you go get a fast food hamburger without the bun, you are not just eating beef like our ancestors did. It is partially beef that has been injected with hormones and antibiotics and taken from hundereds of different grain fed cows, along with other ingredients that aren't even food, so it's not even 100% beef. But as long as you're not eating the bun, it's healthy right? He also doesn't seem to think it's important to eat leafy greens and other fruits and veggies, even though these should be making up the bulk of the diet.

4. The part where he eats the leafy greens and the rice and makes it seem so ""disgusting"" was annoying to me. Personally I would have enjoyed the meal. It's interesting how he emphasizes personal responsibility in not being obese, but then doesn't want to eat healthy himself. It's almost like he is trying to push this idea that it's ok to eat an unhealthy diet, as long as you don't eat grains.

5. The whole idea that he and the other low carb people are trying to push is that grains cause your body to get ""metabolic syndrome,"" which the real cause of obesity in this country. Grains make up the diet of most cultures around the world, including other countries that have low obesity rates. Japan eats rice as one of their main food sources along with fresh veggies and lots of fish. They have the lowest obesity rate in the world. European countries such as Italy and France have high carb diets and much lower obesity rates. It is disturbing to me that by reading a few low carb diet books he seems to think he knows everything about eating ""healthy,"" and by eating steak and bacon all day that is adequate.

6. In a few scenes he asks some people if they have ever eaten fettucine alfredo and then if they have ever had a heart attack, implying that the fettucine does not cause people to have a heart attack. Later he eats a hamburger from a fast food place and emphasizes that he is not having a heart attack. Anyone with any knowledge of research at all will know this was ridiculous, just because you don't have a heart attack after eating does not mean what you are eating is healthy. The research may show that people who eat those foods are more likely to have a heart attack. DUH. He also contradicts himself because after making a big deal out of no one having a heart attack from eating fettucine, he later tells us that grains are bad and are the cause of obesity and heart disease. Huh?

The bottom line is that your foods should be as untampered with as possible. Fruits, veggies, nuts, greens, etc, should make up the bulk of the diet, with some animal products, and personally I believe grains are ok. The obesity problem is not caused by people eating grains. People have eaten grains in this country way before there was an obesity problem. The difference is that back then, they didn't eat processed GMO foods with additives that were not really food. People also don't get enough physical activity.",1299110400,31,6638,4.573109243697479

I'm 5'2 and by December 28th, 2012, I had ballooned to 187 lbs. Not good. I remembered this documentary and watched it again, did some more research, and implemented the core of these new eating habits. I am ecstatic to say that on September 18th, 2013, I hit 125 lbs. Even more phenomenal, is that today's date is June 18th, 2014 (9 months later) and I have kept every pound off! I weigh myself at the same time every morning still, and depending on if I've had a few heavy meals or a couple light days, or even just a couple (TMI!) extra healthy trips to the restroom, my weight stays between 120 and 124 pounds.

3723308,3,B001NRY6R2,"Let me say from the outset that 99% of this movie I loved. I found it to be extremely informative and entertaining. So why only 3 stars? A good part of the Doc goes into Gary Taube's writings. Illustrating the effect of insulin and LPL within the body and how these buggers in those genetically waylaid by them, serve to shuttle energy (cals) into fat cells leaving muscle cells to go hungry. Something, which not only prompts the affected individual to get fatter, but also eat more and/or reduce their activity level because their muscle cells are still starving. Not an enviable position to be in! The core point here is that the person gets overweight primarily due to genetic factors beyond their control. Not because the thin person next to them is a master in the art of self discipline, while they by comparison, are a lazy fat ass! All good stuff. And none it eschews personal responsibility. For that begins when the person is made aware of what is occurring within them, and what they can do to bring about change. But now, we come to the last hurdle. Finishing off the Doc the presenter faces the camera and gives a little speech on personal responsibility. ""Who decides to eat more sugar and more starch instead of taking up a sport or going for a long walk? You do. And if that's your choice? (Shrugs shoulders)"" Wonderful. We move from an illuminating presentation on processes occurring within the body of which most would be unaware.

It reviewed the arguments made by Morgan Spurlock in the film ""Super Size Me"" and answers them with scientific answers. It shows that a healthy diet isn't merely about caloric intake alone, but also the content of the food. It cites prehistoric man's diet as the basis for what our bodies have been primed by evolution to require (basically that processed carbohydrates are bad and animal fats are good). It debunks the Lipid Theory and shows that cholesterol has less to do with health than chronic inflammation and oxidization. It is obviously a slanted, anti-government, anti-vegetarian diet film, but it does present valid arguments and utilizes the resources of medical research and trained professionals (while ""Super Size Me"" relies a great deal on anecdotal evidence). I don't entirely agree with all of the information presented in the film, particularly as the Atkin's low carb diets have essentially been shown to be less than ideal, but I thought it was good to have a counter argument to ""Super Size Me"".

3723319,1,B001NRY6R2,"This film strikes me as a attempt to validate an assortment of preconceived notions using flawed reasoning. The basis of the validity of this film seems to be the contradiction of ""Supersize Me"" at every turn. It is riddled with a slew of fallacies and anecdotes that are at times so painfully obvious I'm not sure if I should feel embarrassed for the narrator or frightened that he is serious.

The film begins with its core premise, namely that ""nobody forces anyone to eat fast food"" (4:44) and ""fast food restaurants don't force anybody to overeat"" (5:14). These are both true statements, but so is the statement ""nobody forces anyone to drink water"". While the analogy I have presented is admittedly extreme (and prime fodder for being taken out of context), it serves to demonstrate that irreducible facts often have no indication of the validity of the argument they are used to support.

In one of the film's numerable appeals to authority it is said that, ""the U.S. department of agriculture has estimated that in order to get people to consume more leafy green vegetables, we would basically have to pay people to eat them."" (34:40) While I'd love to see the references for that statement, it does touch on one of the more subtle yet key aspects of the health debate, namely the addictive qualities of fast/junk food.

The pleasure we experience from food is facilitated by the same neurological mechanisms responsible for the pleasure we experience from sex, drugs, or rock & roll. The reason people prefer a Big Mac to a carrot (34:45) is more than just a psychological preference; it is a physiological one. From the first time we are exposed to junk food at an early age, the pleasure centers of our brains undergo a neuroadaptive change similar to those experienced by drug addicts. (Society for Neuroscience (2009, October 27). Junk Food Diet Causes Rats' Brain Pleasure)

The hunger drive is undoubtedly the strongest urge anyone experiences, which is why junk food is so insidious. When the desire for natural foods is superseded by a desire for junk food, it throws a devastating wrench into the body's processes and wreaks havoc on long-term health. While it is true that ""fast food restaurants don't force anybody to overeat,"" overeating is usually not the cause of obesity. The composition of calorie dense fast foods alters the body's perception of satiety, and it is therefore easy for someone to consume hundreds more calories than they require simply by eating until they are full (i.e. as nature intended).

In addition to being bereft of convincing reasoning, references, or scientific rigor, I was also put off by the condescending tone and insensitive remarks about drug addiction and suicide.

The whole ""Super Size Me"" thing never really rang true for me, and seeing Spurlock on blaming everything on McDonald's was ridiculous but people ate it up. And that crazy factory known as CSPI have always been hiding their true vegetarian agenda behind slants statistics and bogus science. Soy is bad for you, carbs are bad for you, meat and fat are good for you, yet you will never hear that from the vegetarian sect because they make choices based on emotion rather than science and logic.

I found this movie and decided to give it a try. It had some ups and downs. I wasn't thrilled, but it was worth seeing. However, I would highly suggest Taubes' book.

Pros:
-Naughton is a comedian, and definitely makes an entertaining flick.
-I think, nutritionally, he's on the right track. I think it's good for the people to be exposed to the science that goes against the grain. In this case, the grain has been going in the wrong direction for 40 years.

Cons:
-Naughton is apparently unabashedly libertarian. Using Reason magazine editors for such a large portion of your information is distracting at best. Libertarians tend to oversimplify things to make the discourse seem obviously in their favor. That's about all they seem to do well.
-I was somewhat shocked by the racism that was apparent in the movie. Naughton comes out and says African-American's and Mexicans are genetically disposed to being overweight. There is absolutely no scientific evidence for this, and it wouldn't surprise me if he knew it. Both groups are traditionally poorer, and therefore tend to consume more refined carbs because they are less expensive. This proves his point, so I'm unsure why he chose the route he did. Perhaps he didn't do much homework (or thinking) - I'm not sure which is worse.
-They continually use the ""fat people are overweight because they overeat"" non-sense. In Taubes' book, he explicitly spends time demonstrating this to be meaningless (actually, a tautology). Obviously if people are overweight they overeat. This tells us as much as saying an alcoholic drinks too much.

All in all I would probably suggest people see it, but keep in mind that he's no better than Morgan Spurlock (or anyone else that he criticizes) for that matter.",1249948800,17,2163,5.588414634146342
3723327,3,B001NRY6R2,"When I ordered Fat Head, I thought it was going to be a lot more focused on criticizing Supersize Me and exonerating fast food restaurants. I couldn't believe you could eat fast food for a month and lose weight.  And it turns out you can't.  Fat Head isn't really about fast food, but is another entry in the low-fat-vs.-low-carb wars.  Tom Naughton loses weight eating at McDonalds by ordering diet soda and not ordering fries.  This wasn't so interesting to me.  If you don't eat the typical burger, fries, and soda meal, you can follow any kind of diet at McDonalds (even a no-fat, vegetarian diet).

The movie basically tells two stories.  One is Tom Naughton's home-video-camera-style food diary where he eats cheeseburgers and chicken McNuggets for every meal for a month, loses weight, and reduces his body fat percentage.  The other story is the history of the weak science behind low fat dietary recommendations.  A lot of it seems to be a re-telling of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gary-Taubes-story/dp/1400033462/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gary Taubes' story</a>.  While Fat Head provides a service by making Taubes' story accessible to those who aren't going to read the book, the movie doesn't provide nearly enough detail to make a convincing case to those who aren't already believers in a low-carb or Paleo diet.

Tom Naughton is a former stand-up comic, and it shows in the film.  Fat Head is entertaining, and Naughton interviews people on the street and has a good wit about it.  The production values are not Hollywood, but I think Naughton, who is now a computer programmer, put this film together by himself at home, and, considering that, it's very well made.  He interviews some of the big names in the low-carb universe such as the Eades, Mary Enig, Al Sears.  He unfortunately doesn't give time to the other side.  If he could have engaged someone like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robert-Vogel/dp/B002BWQ4RS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robert Vogel</a>&nbsp;in a humor-filled debate that would have been more interesting.

Ultimately, Naughton's perspective on McDonalds is that of a libertarian--if McDonalds wants to sell us burgers and we want to buy them, so what?  While I agree, I'm not sure it's fair to say that people who eat at McDonalds simply value McDonalds food over their body shape.  Part of Gary Taubes' message is that science isn't simple, and I don't think the psychology of eating fast food is simple either.

I'm giving the film only 3 stars because it doesn't break any new ground in dietary information or the politics of food and isn't really good investigative journalism into debunking Supersize Me.  While I got some laughs from it, I didn't learn anything.  This film will be useful mostly for those who are starting from zero knowledge about how the government makes dietary recommendations.

My husband and I have watched it three times (so far) and have enjoyed each viewing immensely, laughing and learning each time through.

Second is that so far, everyone has been unanimous in their resounding enthusiasm and amazement. This is the thing to have if you're trying to get someone to use their own ""functioning brain"" with respect to modern nutritional advice.

I also appreciated Tom's evolutionary approach to diet on a level of principle. So, rather than focus on low carb, he focusses on what we evolved to eat, and low carb is a consequence.

While this message has been delivered before in the form of books and websites, putting it on film, in an entertaining fashion and with the tie in to ""Super Size Me,"" makes the information available to people who would never bother to read a book.

I've lost over 73lbs so far, but after seeing ""Fat Head"", I'm finally seeing the facts of low-carb diets and I'm off the Nutrisystem wagon.  ""Fat Head"" is a funny and immensely informational documentary that goes into the ""bologna"" of the low-fat diet craze.  Like many people in the US, we're told that fat (especially animal fat) is bad and should be avoided at all costs.  Instead, have a piece of bread or a bowl of Special K.  ""Bologna"" says Tom and I believe him!

My father died a few years ago from a heart attack at 55.  He went on Atkins about 5 years prior and I remember comments afterwards like ""there's no telling what that diet did to his system.""  Since I can remember though, my father also liked his large share of carbs and battled his love of food and his desire to lose that last stubborn 30lbs.  After seeing ""Fat Head"", I can only now assume that all of those carbs he loved so much were the real culprit behind his heart disease- not the fact that he was on Atkins for 6 months.

8327819,1,B001NRY6R2,"I hated how condescending Tom Naughton was! He also basically dismissed all research surrounding the effects of advertising on consumers, saying that we are all autonomous and can make our own choices. The point of Super Size Me (WHICH IS FLAWED YES), was not that individuals are LITERALLY FORCED to eat this way, but that there are systemic inequalities in place and those inequalities coupled with marketing strategies and the normalization of larger portions, leads to bad nutritional choices. When Naughton tried to refute the claim that many low-income individuals don't have internet access, and therefore access to nutritional information, he suggested they go to the library or buy a book. If you are a low-income individual with a family, the chances are that you are working many hours in a low-wage job. When would you have the time to do all this research???

I don't know, I hated this documentary...but not because I think McDonald's is evil or that fat is bad.

8327822,3,B001NRY6R2,"Tom Naughton gets a few things right in this movie, namely that the fear of saturated fat is misguided, and the researchers who advanced the hypothesis that it causes heart disease never satisfactorily made their case. Naughton also makes some good criticisms of Super Size Me, which was largely just a propaganda piece for an activist lawyer seeking to sue McDonalds (although their food is obviously very unhealthy).

I believe, however, that Fat Head bungles the subjects of carbohydrates and weight loss. Naughton seeks to disprove the conventional eat less, move more advice by eating less and moving more. He limits his calories to under 2,000 per day, and walks six nights a week. Dont you think if Naughton truly believed Gary Taubes, he would have stayed sedentary, gorged himself on bunless double bacon cheeseburgers, and still managed to lose weight? Should have been possible if all there is to body fat is insulin spikes from eating carbohydrates.

A few other bones I have to pick with this documentary. Naughton tries to hop on the Paleo bandwagon by saying primitive humans ate a lot of animal fat, and not many carbs, but thats not so clear. Hunter-gatherers verifiably ate yams and other starchy tubers, fruit, honey, and theres even evidence of sorghum consumption in Africa dating back 105,000 years. This weird naturopathic doctor named Al Sears claims our grandparents' generation knew potatoes, bread, and rice were fattening, but thats not so clear either. If you look up the USDAs report called Nutrient Content of the US Food Supply, 1909-2000, it appears potato and grain consumption actually fell over the course of the 20th century. Finally, Dr. Mary Enig (who I otherwise respect, because she helped sound the alarms about toxic vegetable oils) is definitely stretching the truth when she states that CSPI is a vegetarian organization. While its co-founder Jacobson sits on the council of the Great American Meatout, he is actually more of a semi-vegetarian or pescetarian, and CSPI has listed wild-caught salmon as one of its 10 Best Foods.

Overall, Fat Head is a humorously presented movie which will get people questioning mainstream nutrition. If you adopt a low carb diet from a standard American diet, you will most likely lose weight, but like all other restrictive diets, including the low fat and vegetarian ones Naughton criticizes, its probably not sustainable for the average person. So why not focus more on food quality and exercise rather than Puritanically avoiding certain macronutrients or food groups?",1509667200,,2552,5.1298076923076925
