8651580,5,B00JK19JMU,"I liked the movie, however it was historically inaccurate in at least one part - it showed the whites were poisoning wells, when it was actually the slaves that did it.",1524355200,,168,4.451612903225806
8651581,5,B00JK19JMU,Excellent tale of strength and Nubian pride. Not some weak image like 12 years of slavery but a true image of Nubian revolution!,1470096000,,128,4.608695652173913
8651582,4,B00JK19JMU,"This film takes place on the island of Curaqao  in 1795. We know that the slave revolt is a failure from the opening scene. The movie regresses a couple of weeks to the events leading up to the sentencing.  Inspired by the Haitians having a successful slave revolt, Tula believes the slaves on this island are free and coupled with harsh conditions he demands to speak to the governor. This leads to a general uprising.

The film centers on Tula and his inner circle and those that betray him. The film is sad yet at the same time spiritually uplifting.  The violence is kept to a minimal, yet doesn't refrain from showing a few scenes.  Appears to be suitable for a high school or perhaps even a junior high teaching film.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1397001600,,752,4.492647058823529
