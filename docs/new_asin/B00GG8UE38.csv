6075186,5,B00GG8UE38,"There are so many goodies contained on this DVD it would be hard to list a favorite. However, if I had to, it would be the inclusion of the home movies taken by KFO director Lewis Gomavitz. These show KFO both relaxing and at work. Look closely (well, not that close!) and you'll see some of the celebrities that worked with them, both on their show and other venues.
A real treat, don't pass it up!",1390348800,5,399,4.2631578947368425
6075187,5,B00GG8UE38,"I worked closely with Burr and Fran in the latter days of their career.  I know Burr was very, very particular about how his work and characters were represented.  This collection, and the first two volumes, are beautifully and carefully prepared in a way I have no doubt would please Burr.  It is simple, elegant, driven by character and lovingly crafted.  I have ordered copies of all three volumes for my children as well as my parents. There are other collections, but this is the first time I've wanted to do this.",1389052800,11,519,4.608695652173913
6075188,5,B00GG8UE38,"I cannot recommend this new volume of classic Kukla, Fran & Ollie too much!  I urge everyone to go out and buy one, no two, no three copies--more even, and give them out as gifts to friends and relations!  The world needs more KFO--let's start a revolution and spread the word of the greatness of Burr Tillstrom and Fran Allison!",1388275200,10,329,4.466666666666667
6075189,5,B00GG8UE38,These volumes just keep getting better and better.  The extras included with this one make it a real gem.  Can't wait for more.,1388275200,6,127,4.478260869565218
6075190,4,B00GG8UE38,brought back old memories .. i bought the whole set.  i gave some to my grand kids .. they love to watch the quiet and kind discourse.  i was shocked to see just how much there is on each DVD ...  8 GB  on each double layer DVD full of stuff.  enough to keep kids busy for hours ..  the quality was better than i expected from way back then ..  they even show commercials of the day .. those are actually entertaining now ... kids don't seem to notice that much of this is black and white.  someone put in a lot of effort to bring this all back to us.,1388016000,4,551,3.857142857142857
6075191,5,B00GG8UE38,This is a very good album of KFO. A lot of extras in it like Gommy's home movies are excellent. It's well worth owning,1386201600,10,118,3.9583333333333335

8622749,5,B00GG8UE38,I was disappointed to learn that Blu-Rays Have zones that require different players.  I have Invisible Invaders yet cannot watch it.  Now I shall have to buy a dvd version instead.,1519948800,,180,4.774193548387097

8622751,5,B00GG8UE38,Great stuff,1483920000,,11,5.0
8622752,5,B00GG8UE38,"This is an unforgettable collection of some of the greatest television in the history of the medium.

Each character has an original identity. Kukla, Ollie, Beulah, Fletcher... all of them.
And Fran Allison is magical. She is the one, her belief in each character, that makes
each episode so alive and so memorable.

I think that, as an artist, Burr Tillstom is utterly without peer.

This collection radiates love.",1447632000,2,415,4.9855072463768115

8622756,4,B00GG8UE38,I found it very entertaining to be taken back to the early days of television with it's slower pace and simpler messages.,1415404800,,121,4.545454545454546
8622757,5,B00GG8UE38,"So many memories; so much happiness. What a treasure. I loved this show when I was a kid; I love it even more today via these wonderful DVDs. If you enjoyed KFO when you were a kid, you won't go wrong adding these DVDs to your collection.

In the ""Salute to Utica"" episode on Volume 3, Fran Allison sings a lovely song which is possibly titled ""In December."" Does anyone out there know if this song has ever been recorded by Fran Allison (or any other vocalist)? I have searched the internet with no satisfactory results; perhaps I have the title incorrect.
