I wish they would've made the story more universally appealing by having him either be single or a widower. Having him be divorced then romantically interested in the female lead (their budding romance is part of the plot), means that only certain groups will appreciate that part of the story.  I bought it for my (Catholic) church library, so that kind of nixed it for me.  Also, since the plot was supposed to be about a former bruiser hockey player who, after his conversion, wouldn't bruise, I expected more scenes of hockey and the funny scenarios that would result from his change. That was a great idea and would've been really fun to see.  However, they barely touched on it.  Could've been a much better movie!",1457222400,,828,4.722222222222222
8578075,5,B00C7BZG7W,"I really liked this movie & I'm not into sports, but Billy Graham films all have a message. We live our lives, but really for who? There is a female singer that sings a song during the first part of the film & the same song at the end. I'd really like to know what the song is & who's singing it. I'm a bit upset I cannot find ANY of the songs from his films online. I've tried different solutions, nothing! If anyone knows, please tell me! Thanks so much. God Bless!",1443916800,,467,4.032258064516129
