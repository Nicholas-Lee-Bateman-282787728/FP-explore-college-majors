8377040,1,B002PJ77K0,I own all of the GI Joe comics and DVD sets. This one is terrible. It switches from cartoon animation to (very crude) computer animation during fight scenes. There is no rhyme or reason to these episodes- which last only about 5 minutes. This DVD has little to do with GI Joe and I would rather smash my big toe with a ball-ping hammer than watch it again. Awful... just awful.,1402790400,2,377,4.323943661971831
8377041,5,B002PJ77K0,I was introduced to these by my children decades ago. It is so nice to see the good guys and the bad guys being clearly defined and always a happy ending.,1348012800,,154,4.0
