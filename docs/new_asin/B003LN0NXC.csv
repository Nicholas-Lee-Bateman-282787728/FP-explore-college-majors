4153487,2,B003LN0NXC,"I have to say, after watching this I was very disappointed, some of the fights was interesting, but it was very hard for me to enjoy this compared to Chocolate. Chocolate is so much better, and worth the to own on blu-ray. From movies like this, I never expect much from the story and plot, I usually watch these movies for the fighting and action, which what this movie was all about, cheap plots put together as an excuse for the fights. I was expecting much better fighting from this movie, the trailer definitely made it seem very cool. But after watching its not that great, I'll just stick to watching the protector a billion times more.",1285718400,3,643,4.504273504273504
4153488,3,B003LN0NXC,"I saw Chocolate a few months before Raging Phoenix came out so i had a good idea of what to expect. Jeeja Yanin seems like a female equivalent of Tony Jaa, a little limited as far as physical capabilities in comparison to Tony Jaa, however still very impressive. Chocolate touted the ""no wires"" banner proudly as Ong Bak did, Raging Phoenix tries to fly the same sign, but is deceitful in this endeavor.

There are a couple things wrong with this movie. The story doesn't flow very smoothly. There are segments where they try to build more character and flush out the story, but this is a mistake because none of the characters are that compelling and the story is too shallow at its core to handle a lot of attention.

The hook, as far as the action scenes go, is that the fighting style for the lead characters is a mix of dance, drunk and tai styles. They only employ this style for the first half of the movie. They eventually abandon this style and fall into more spectacle styles. Wires and padding is used liberally, especially towards the end of the film.

Jeeja Yanin's character is represented as ""badass"" on the cover but she ends up spending most of her screen time covered in her own blood. She's beaten, battered, captured, stripped, beaten some more, and forced to shotgun tequila. She is anything BUT a badass. If anything at all, she's a victim of many more powerful and aggressive characters than herself, and barely has hopes of making it out of any confrontation alive.

It may sound like i have a lot of criticism for this movie, but it's mostly coming from failed expectations of what i thought it would provide. The fights in here are well choreographed. The acting is passable. The music is terrible. For fans of tai films and/or jeeja yanin should see Raging Phoenix, all others should stay very far away.",1283644800,,1830,4.587155963302752
4153489,3,B003LN0NXC,"It was nothing like the movie Chocolate, but it was still a good movie, the story line was terrible, but the fighting scenes were good.",1282348800,,135,4.44
4153490,3,B003LN0NXC,"To sum up the film: Very cool action set pieces; bloody awful story. We knew there was gonna be imense pressure for Jeeja Yanin's sophomore work to equal or surpass her debut film CHOCOLATE and, to be honest, RAGING PHOENIX carries a whiff of trying too hard. Jeeja Yanin in CHOCOLATE played a mildly autistic debt collector and so it makes sense to have her switching it up in this one. She plays Deu, one of those party girls who have too much free time on her hands. The film opens during a spectacularly bad series of moments for Deu. She gets kicked out of her rock band, gets spectacularly liquored up, and then gets abducted by a girl and by - and I guess this is the Thai sense of humor at work - a chubby transvestite. She's saved by a melancholy dude named Sanim who along the way fends off a bunch of goons on pogo stilts sporting wicked sharp blades - this, by the way, doesn't at all seem contrived. Really. Deu ends up joining Sanim's tiny band of inebriated martial artists, and these guys specialize in ""Meyraiyuth,"" a form of drunken Muay Thai boxing which incorporates breakdancing. We learn along the way that Sanim and his friends are seeking an elusive organization of kidnappers. It's not too long before Deu picks up drunken Muay Thai boxing. In fact, it may be best to overlook the inordinately short amount of time it takes Deu to pick up impressive fighting skills. Personally, it's even more challenging for me to buy into Jeeja Yanin's pretending to be this girl who, at the start of the film, can't fight at all.

Likewise, it's best not to dwell too much on the kidnappers' target victims. It all has to do with certain women exuding a particular scent, and these women are taken so that their tears could be extracted and sold as a curative for staggering sums of money. It's all pretty ""What the f---?""

Like in Tony Jaa's movies - and I wonder if we'll always be comparing JeeJa Yanin to Tony Jaa? - RAGING PHOENIX has a sketchy plot which is there solely to frame the crunching slugfests. What sort of sinks the picture is that things often get bogged down in superfluous plot exposition and forced melodrama. When no one is getting a sharp knee to the face, the pace slows downs to a snail's pace. There are also times when our girl sounds really shrill and when I was thinking that maybe she was better off in CHOCOLATE when she barely had dialogue. She's not as wooden as Tony Jaa. In fact, Jeeja does demonstrate expressiveness and personality (dug her drunken Muay Thai when she first goes off on her own). I blame a screenplay that's listless and the shoddy direction and the fact that this is a Thai martial arts film, a genre which tends to ignore trivial details like good acting and fine execution of story.

We're here strictly for the martial arts stuff, so how was that? Just when I was thinking that THE REBEL's Veronica Ngo was the new lady sheriff in town when it came to buttkicking heroines, here's that wisp of a girl Jeeja Yanin once more kneeing opponents in their painful parts. There are several fight sequences here, and the first two has our heroine taking a back seat to French-Vietnamese martial artist ""Kazu"" Patrick Tang.(""Sanim"") and his crew (comprised of members of a B-Boy band in real life). These sequences are really nifty, if unrealistic. The first fight, against the pogo stilt henchmen, demonstrates Kazu's athleticism. The second is the big drunken Muay Thai boxing showcase, and it's cool to see our guys popping and locking and breakdancing while handling their business against some more evil henchmen. The music playing in the background amps you up, too.

Jeeja Yanin gets in the act in later encounters - and her character even challenges one of Sanim's guys into a duel by the beach - but, really, it's not until the final 30 minutes that the real Jeeja Yanin comes out to play. Her brutal beat down of two formidable martial artists is an electrifying highlight. But then to top it off, she takes on the menacing female leader of the kidnappers in a rematch (her previous tussle with her, over a lattice of shaky wooden bridges, ended somewhat in a draw). The film's Big Bad is played by Roongtawan Jindasing who is a champion body builder in real life, and she looks mean enough to wipe the floor with you and me and Shaquille O'Neal (and while she's wearing a bikini bra, no less). And, in the department of ""That's Really Gonna Leave A Funky Bruise,"" JeeJa Yanin's devastating finishing move on Jindasing will drop your jaw. Yanin does her own stunts again, and it's crazy insane to see her acrobatic moves and observe the impact her blows have. Just when I'd thought I'd seen everything Muay Thai had to offer, Yanin demonstrates a series of electrifying maneuvers. I almost don't mind the sometimes glaringly obvious wire work.

This rating thing is pretty subjective. I'm compelled to give this film 3 stars out of 5 (breaks down to 5 stars for the fighting, 1 star for the crappalicious story content). Except that if you already knew going in that the story would get the back seat treatment and you only showed up to see JeeJa Yanin pummel thugs anyway, do you then only rate this for the action bits? I dunno. I say, 3 stars.

Last thing for me. Seriously, what awful ungodly brew was in that jug that everyone had to drink to cement their team membership? It's got me curious.",1281916800,12,5369,4.575883575883576
4153491,4,B003LN0NXC,"Okay...so what can I say about Raging Phoenix? Well to begin...was it as good as Jeeja's first film Chocolate? Sorry Jeeja...while my love for you will never die, I must say no. Does that mean it sucks like many other reviewers on other sites might have you believe? No again. Like it's star, it kicks much butt. But it does have one major-league downfall of a flaw...the plot is uber thin and really rather ridiculous.

Everyday thousands of women everywhere are kidnapped and sold into the sex-slavery trade...and in Thailand it is no different. Enter our four intrepid heroes: Sanim, Pig, Dog, and Bull [add another word for excrement as the name for the last three]. These four hapless guys have all had some very special and important women in their lives kidnapped. They have all banded together to hunt down those responsible and make them pay by beating them severely about their head and neck as well as other sensitive parts of their person with a brand spanking new form of martial arts called Meyraiyuth. This new style is suspiciously similar to Capoeira and uses a combination of drunken Muay Thai and breakdancing.

Unfortuantely, these guys aren't having any luck in finding the bad guys or their secret hideout. So they hit upon the awesome idea of setting up some poor, unsuspecting girl as bait, having her get kidnapped, and following the evil doers back to their lair. And as you might have guessed by now, Jeeja is that girl. She plays a character named Deu, a wimpy, spoiled, little, rich girl who is ignored by her family and has had a string of bad relationships...so she's perfect. Their plan might have worked too, but Sanim started feeling guilty about what they were doing, and at the last minute rescues her from her would be captors and then takes her under his wing as his new Padawan learner.

The four guys get her drunk and then...teach her Meyraiyuth so they can later use her for another similar plan. Only this time, she will be able to protect herself from the villain's dastardly plan...which I won't go into because you gotta see it to understand and believe it.

Alright so...the fight scenes are pretty cool...Jeeja is at her impressive best and the rest of the guys are also pretty damn good fighters. The cinematography for the film is also pretty sweet...at least until the climax. At that point we get a lot of hokey wire-work against a green screen and the final showdown with Jeeja and the film's main antagonist seems to drag on much longer than it needs to.

In all, the film is pretty decent for Jeeja's sophomore outing

Now...I did not buy this Blu-ray from Amazon; I purchased a region zero import from that BIG auction site for a lot less than what it was going for here. I'm glad I did get it though, because the disc had a number of trailers on it for some really cool looking movies. Like IP Man with Donnie Yen, which I did pre-order from Amazon.

Okay...techie time:

Picture was crystal clear and the colors were very vivid. Sound was very loud and crisp. The movie has no English dub, so you will be forced to read subtitles...which is fine as there is more fighting than talking.

So that's it...hope you enjoy the movie as much as I did.

And FYI - I recently read that a sequel to Chocolate was in the works, taking place primarily in Japan...can't wait!",1278547200,6,3320,4.611864406779661
4153492,5,B003LN0NXC,"I have seen JeeJa Yanin' s Chocolate and was completely impressed by the story, acting, and Choreagraphy of the fight scenes. I loved it. So much I searched the internet and found out she has a second one. I suddenly found this one as well on amazon.com . I bought it immediately along with an uncut version of Chocolate.

Raging Phoenix is excellent. I like them both but Chocolate is my favorite. Raging Phoenix has the same impressive choreagraphy and I like the story as well. In just a very short time JeeJa Yanin has become my favorite martial arts leading person.

Like all things, it is a matter of individual taste or preference. I recommend watching the previews or trailers available of both movies on amazon.com and Youtube and decide if you might like them enough to either rent or buy them.

I can hardly wait for her third film.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chocolate/dp/B001L67A4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chocolate</a>",1266105600,4,977,5.3311688311688314
4153493,1,B003LN0NXC,"It quickly becomes evident from a viewing of this DVD that it's an unauthorized copy of the film and a very poorly-made one as well. The quality of the print is so bad that it was painful to watch, and it was only my great appreciation for ""Chocolate"" that made me want to try. I gave up about a quarter to a third of the way into the movie.

Bottom line... I bought this movie to see her in some great action scenes with perfect choreography and hard hitting sound fx. THAT IS NOT IN THIS MOVIE.
sorry.

Hope her next movie is better. I AM A HUGE FAN OF CHOCOLATE and don't want her to fade away.",1264550400,,615,4.159663865546219
4153496,5,B003LN0NXC,"I wasn't expecting much from JeeJa Yanin's original film (""Chocolate""), but her physical talents were showcased in spectacular fashion and won me over despite the shortcomings in terms of scriptwriting. That film grew on me more and more after repeat viewings, but there still was room for improvement in the pacing and storyline elements. Enter ""Raging Phoenix"", which not only avoids a sophomore slump for JeeJa, but actually surpasses ""Chocolate"" in total entertainment value.

One way it does this is to allow JeeJa to express her camera presence and charisma. This was surprising to me personally, because her previous role in ""Chocolate"" was so introverted and robotic that it was essentially impossible to determine whether or not this girl could steal a scene without beating someone's brains in. In ""Raging Phoenix"", however, she really cuts loose during the opening half as she jokes around, engages in some funny dialogue, and participates in some light-hearted fight scenes involving drunken styles of martial arts. That one-vs-many boat brawl is - now wait for it - a boat-load of fun. JeeJa exhibits a natural likability that her fellow countryman Tony Jaa severely lacks. Don't misunderstand me, because I am a fan of Tony's films, but he has some serious limitations as all of his screen presence is earned through his (phenomenal) physical skills. JeeJa, on the other hand, portrays her character in a way that is very endearing. In other words, I'd love to have her as a younger sister. This charm is a major reason why this film is so entertaining. When the action scenes are bridged by good ""non-action stuff"", that's a huge plus.

The mood gets more serious when the kidnapping plot line is fleshed out more, but even here the film stays attention-grabbing with an interesting twist involving drug dealing. Now, I'm not saying that the script is incredibly strong. It's not going to win any awards in that realm, nor is it as strong as more dramatic action films like ""Kill Zone"" (2005), but it does build anticipation for the finale and establishes characters a bit more than usual. In addition, ""Raging Phoenix"" one-ups ""Chocolate"" by introducing a very strong lead antagonist during the latter half (played by Roongtawan Jindasing - Asian Pacific Women's Bodybuilding Champion). This lady is one tough son-of-a-gun who proves incredibly difficult to take down, which automatically makes things a bit more exciting than having JeeJa beat down random stuntmen the entire time.

Which brings us to the action scenes. There are some one-vs-many scenarios early on, but that shifts decisively towards one-on-one and two-on-one battles afterward, which results in some outstanding fist-a-cuffs. The cavern hideout finale lasts a solid 30 minutes, and Roongtawan Jindasing hands out a great deal of damage to JeeJa and her buddies. It escalates to the point of making one's hairs stand on end, especially when JeeJa gets her second wind and slugs it out in EPIC fashion. That sequence must be an instant classic (at least in terms of girl vs girl mayhem). Heck, this entire film is an instant classic.

If you liked ""Chocolate"", you need to see this. If you didn't like ""Chocolate"", you need to see this anyways. It's truly an excellent action film, and quite possibly the best girl fighting movie ever made.",1264377600,36,3325,5.0510018214936245

4153499,4,B003LN0NXC,"Jeeja in this film was just as entertaining as she was in the movie Chocolate along with SOME of the other performers, but the biggest letdown came towards the end fight scene between her character & the main ""female"" antagonist. The reason why I placed quotations around female, is because it wasn't the actress at all that was involved in any of the fight scenes. Instead it was a stunt MAN that did all the cool looking moves. I know this is how action films are generally made, but at least most of the others I've seen in the past made a better conscious effort was to hide this very well known fact with selective camera angles while filming. This movie crew did no such thing & you can clearly see the stunt persons' face right in plain view. This REALLY took me out of the rest of the movie even though I enjoyed it up until that point. Now that I'm writing this review I also recall being able to see the faces of a couple of other stunt guys as well during other fight scenes towards the end of the movie. Maybe everyone became lazy, & just wanted to wrap things up as quickly as they could. It does ruin the imagination of believing the actors doing everything themselves, & I hope I don't have to witness something like this too often in the future.",1438560000,3,1261,4.324894514767933

4153503,4,B003LN0NXC,"I was interested in this film primarily because I was looking for more films by it star, JeeJa Yanin, who blew me away in her first and only previous film, Chocolate. I found Chocolate a few years ago while searching for more films by the producer/director of the film Ong-Bak (Muay Thai Warrior), Prachya Pinkaew, and had been wanting to see more of Yanin ever since.  I had been a longtime lover of (mostly Chinese and American) martial arts films, and Ong-Bak was my introduction to Thai martial arts films, and it was just PHENOMENAL, the acrobatic fighting style and skill level of star Tony Jaa was unlike anything I'd ever seen.  Pinkaew also created Chocolate, the breakout film for star JeeJa Yanin. Some of the fight scenes and stunts she did in that film were just unparalleled feats of awesome!

Looking for more of her films, I found Raging Phoenix, by a different producer/director, but with the same fight choreographer as Ong-Bak and Chocolate (Weerapon Poomatfon). While the premise of the film was a bit silly, the fight choreography (and execution) was just AMAZING. Poomatfon devised incredibly inventive setups/scenarios for the fights, and some really remarkable cooperative fighting (e.g. 2 people working together to fight one or more others... often swinging their partner around in acrobatic ways to use them as a weapon).

SUMMARY:
This film is DEFINITELY worth the streaming rental fee to watch purely for the incredibly inventive fight choreography. I'd be happy to watch any other film starring JeeJa Yanin or with action choreographed by the unparalleled Weerapon Poomatfon - their work utterly blows me away every time.",1428192000,2,1651,5.0588235294117645

HOWEVER. Amazon's Digital Download service for this is the worst thing ever. First of all, its dubbed in English, which they did a terrible job with, making many of the voices stupidly goofy and annoying. Secondly it has hard subtitles on the screen (with the oh-so-nice option of adding MORE subtitles over on top of that for no apparent reason). The video quality is mediocre at best, and the audio is somewhat muted. With the exception of the horrible, horrible dubbing. I stopped watching it about 10 minutes in, and I won't be finishing it.

4153511,3,B003LN0NXC,"As others have written this film has a stereotypically horrific plot combined with brilliantly choreographed (if tediously lengthy) fight scenes.

Basically we here have Jija Yanin (Chocolate) playing a girl who escapes an attempted kidnapping after being rescued by the fleet of foot Sanim and this rescue leads her into contact with his friends whose main goal is to combat a girl trafficking syndicate. Now that almost sounds like a plot but don't worry, it's actually far sillier and inconsequential than it sounds in such a short synopsis. After all, this is from the producers of Ong Bak and they rarely trouble the audience with much of a plot in between fight sequences.

Anyway, as far as the fight scenes go we here have something a little different - no drunken Kung Fu but instead drunken Muay Thai mixed with something called B'Boy Dancing (nah, me neither). Effectively our Thai protagonists use a form of dance based Muay Thai where you jump around a lot delivering blows that really wouldn't be delivering much power but hey, that's not the point is it really. The point is to have ridiculously long fight scenes where people put on a clinic of gymnastic ability.

Production values and the choreography will have you applauding the skills to contort the body and put together the scenes while chuckling at the absurdity of the moves as fight options. There is probably a little too much cutting about with the editing and really that does detract somewhat from the film. And again, the fight scenes are laboriously long. They weren't aiming for a general 'action film' audience here, only the martial arts action movie will groove on this.

There are a range of special features on the disc and subtitles though admittedly you could probably just fast forward past the dialogue scenes.

A nicely shot film, actually some decent acting in parts, a little bit of character development even. And lots and lots of brilliantly executed gymnastics and dance moves disguised as fighting moves.",1409961600,,2003,4.931750741839763

Yanin is to me the reason for the three stars, she can act though the english dub did her no favors, her facial expressions and intensity sort of shine.

4153535,5,B003LN0NXC,"If you like to watch b-boy, freerunning, parkour, and similar styles of kinetic movement and would watch an entire movie over and over again purely for the choreography, this could be your kind of movie.  I love the fusion of martial arts styles with post-2000 hip hop dance moves yet there is a grace to it that you don't see in a lot of b-boy.  If you like dubstep, you will enjoy the precision of Jija Yanin's hand work that emerges from her use of advanced blocking systems, even my pre-teen dubstep head daughter was impressed.  I enjoy watching her work in this movie even more than I did in Chocolate, and this movie is a lot less gory, but still gritty.  I chalked up the sometimes nasaly whining of Jija Yanin's character to a culture-specific caricature, but I don't know if that's true, it's something that I have also heard in certain styles of Asian music, perhaps it is an acquired taste.  Voice aside, in Chocolate she played a character who was supposed to seem unemotional, in this movie you get to see that she has a range of expression and at least I found her believable as the character and sympathetic.  Finally, I am tired of slick Matrix style fighting with tons of rigging and wire work.  It's refreshing to see movies coming out of Thailand and Korea especially with talented individuals who accomplish so much with minimal use of wires.  If wires are used the transition to wires is seamless, it's not an abrupt switch to video game physics like you see in the Matrix movies.  For me, it was worth it just to see the fight scene with three levels of rope bridges and people moving between the bridges while fighting, to me that is still an amazing sequence.",1328659200,,1684,4.531353135313531
4153536,3,B003LN0NXC,"The first few minutes are lackluster and do not draw you in much. I nearly turned it off. After a few more minutes it seemed really lame so I got up to get a drink figuring I would turn it off when I got back. When I walked back in the room Miss Yanin's character was being carried off by someone and they were being attacked by pogo stick ninjas. Yes.. pogo stick ninjas. So a few minutes of this incredibly stupid scene and I began to think this might be one of those movies that is so badly stupid that it's good. The next fight scene was with drunken breakdancing fighters and it kinda solidified my stupid movie theory. Happily after those two scenes the movie mellows out to a more professional level and ends up being decent. The plot of the story is not spectacular but it is interesting enough to serve as a martial arts vehicle. It is a bit on the fantastical side so if a realistic believable plot is something you desire steer clear of this movie. If you don't mind a tiny sci-fi or mystical touch it is an interesting concept.

 The martial arts in the movie are good. Even in the first two scenes with their dumb concept there's plenty to admire. There are as much acrobatics as punches so if you like seeing the extremes of what the human body can do you will like this movie. The fights all have different flavours so they stand apart from each other. Theres humor, anger, perseverance, fear, technicality, loathing in various fights and this helps keep the movie from just being a slugfest.

 We have to compare this to Chocolate right? I'll be quick about it. Miss Yanin can act. She wasn't cast as an autistic child in her first movie to cover up a lack of ability. We see a lot of different emotions from here in this one and she pulls it off nicely. The fight scenes in this one are not as well done as chocolate though. I'm sure her ability is there but the choreography and fight concepts fall flat when comparing. Chocolate was about 90% fight an 10% story. Raging Phoenix strikes a better balance between fight and story. Chocolate was much more stylish and had a a lot more class as far as fight scenes went.

Raging Phoenix lost a star because of the incredibly stupid pogo stick ninjas (they weren't really pogo sticks, they were running stilts with blades attached) It lost another star for keeping the secret of the plot for so long when nearly all the characters knew and had no discernible reason for keeping it a secret. It just made the story move slower than it needed to.",1319932800,,2507,4.394396551724138
4153537,4,B003LN0NXC,"The ""Chocolate"" star JeeJa Yanin, plays a hot-tempered heroine Deu, a rock band drummer, recently dismissed from the band. Down and out Deu is almost kidnapped by mysterious thugs, but is saved by three martial artists, who seem perpetually drunk. Actually, they are fighting the crime syndicate the Jaguar Gang, a group of deadly martial artists abducting a certain type of women for their special purposes.

A Thai action movie ""Raging Phoenix"" opens with a much light-hearted tone than Yanin's previous film ""Chocolate."" This time JeeJa Yanin is allowed to show what she can do as an actress, and she is pretty good as a lonely girl who finds her place (and love) in the most unexpected place. The idea of getting drunk to be a strong fighter is not really original (remember Jackie Chan's classic?), and Deu's transformation to a strong martial artist (after training sequences) is not convincing, but we know they are just familiar narrative devices for action sequences, and it is action stunts that really matter.

And once again, JeeJa Yanin delivers amazing stunts that are well-choreographed with styles. Though wires are sometimes used, the actions are skillfully done with capable supports (as Deu's fellow fighters) from Kazu Patrick Tang, Nui Saendaeng, Sompong Lertwimonkaisom and Boonprasayrit Salangam. The film itself suffers from occasional lulls in pace, and the ""perfume"" part of the story looks a bit too silly to me, but the bone-crunching fighting scenes in the final thirty minutes alone are worth your money.

In short, ""Raging Phoenix"" is a slick action movie with some exciting stunts.",1318550400,,1613,5.148854961832061
4153538,4,B003LN0NXC,"In a nutshell, I don't know.  It's tough to say if it's superior or not.  On the one hand I was more interested in the story for this movie, well, at least for the first 3/4ths.  On the other hand, the story gets more ridiculous as it goes on, as do some of the fight sequences.

  First, about the fights.  In Chocolate, they were entertaining, but got monotonous and dull up until some moments in the finale.  In this movie, the fights stay pretty good up until the ending.  The fights drag on to nearly unbearable lengths.  I'm talking about fights where you will be shouting, ""Oh come on, there's no way they would be standing after that, much less be conscious!""  For those of you you usually give a movie leeway on that sort of thing, trust me when I say this movie is really going to test your patience in the final sequences.  The only time I was willing to let the fight length slide was in the final fight between the main heroin and the main villain, who has no build-up in the movie whatsoever.  The final fight, while it does go on forever, does pull off some pretty cool moves that will keep you sitting through it a little longer just to see what move they will do next.  Fight length aside, the wire tricks become way too obvious in the last few fights.
  So which movie has the better fights?  I guess when I think back on it, Raging Phoenix beats Chocolate in that regard, but good God will it test your patience in the last half hour.

  The story.  Long story short, it's weak in both movies, but was more interesting and easier to get into for Raging Phoenix, at least for a while.  It takes place partly on a beach, partly in a suburban town, which is all fair and good.  But then all logic gets thrown out the window when the villain's secret hideout is found.  All of a sudden it's like the arrived on the set of Temple of Doom, with caves and wooden bridges that are ready to fall apart, but stay strong just long enough for fights to take place on them.  At that point, any interest I had in the story went out the window, and I was just watching it for the fights from that point on.
  So which is better in terms of story?  I hate to say this, but Chocolate is more solid all around, but isn't as easy to get into compared to Raging Phoenix.  It's only because the newer movie fall apart at the end to I give the point to Chocolate.  But then again, who watches these movies for the story anyway?

  Memorable moments.  In Chocolate, it was the finale on the side of the building where they fought along 3 stories, plus seeing the heroin kick ass for the first time in the ice-house and the location after that.  In this movie, the heroin surprisingly doesn't eat up as much screen time.  Her allies, drunken boxers, show a lot of awesome fight work, showing that they can match-up with Jija Yanin, and that's no small feat.  It's also great to see Jija get into drunken boxing.  The finale, man, that's a bittersweet thing.  The finale isn't quite as strong as in Chocolate, but the moves pulled off on the last mono-i-mono fight are pretty impressive.  So I guess Raging Phoenix has more memorable moments.

  Final thoughts.  Writing this review, I guess I should say Raging Phoenix is superior to Chocolate.  In many ways it is, but in plenty of other ways it isn't.  I guess it's mainly because I was hoping for a more solid finale.  The fights at the end got so long they became boring, which I couldn't believe.  But better or worse than Chocolate, is it worth seeing?  Absolutely, and you don't need to see Chocolate first before seeing this one.  Can't wait to see the next movie Jija Yanin will be in.  I just hope she eventually gets a role in a movie that ends up rivaling Jaa's best movies (and hopefully we will see another one from him in the future if he can resolve his problems).",1311638400,,3825,4.309423347398031

Basically if you enjoyed Ong Bak or Jackie Chan's Drunken Master you will definitely enjoy this. It doesn't have the greatest of plots or storyline, but it more than makes up for that with one dazzling move after another with a lot of good slap stick humor between. You will laugh and feel exhilarated while watching the movie. It is definitely worth at least renting.

4153542,4,B003LN0NXC,"When Tony's away, Jeeja will play...or at least try to take over the title of best international action hero, a feat which seems wholly obtainable with Thai cinema gurus Prachya Pinkaew and Panna Rittikrai on her side. Not since the advent of Michelle Yeoh and Cynthia Rothrock has it seemed feasible for a lady to establish herself over the top stars of the day in the realm of martial arts films, but not only did the petite powerhouse Jeeja Yanin draw considerable first blood with her debut in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chocolate/dp/B001L67A4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chocolate</a>&nbsp;a few years ago, her follow-up film here may very well be the single best entry to fill the void of the Jaa-free landscape. Is it without flaws? - of course not. But it's still one of the most exciting features I saw during the year of its western release.

The story: troubled indie rock & roller Deu (Yanin) is rescued from the Jaguar Gang - an underground circuit specializing in kidnapping young women - by the leader of a small opposing gang (Patrick Tang,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bangkok-Adrenaline/dp/B003X3BY74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bangkok Adrenaline</a>). Trained by him and his colorful cohorts in their unique style of martial arts - Meyraiyuth - Deu is recruited as a member of a counter-effort to find out where all the other kidnapped young women disappear to and what fiendish purpose they are used for...

The movie's glaring fault is its narrative. Though it evens itself out as the film goes along, the opening 35 minutes or so are an unwelcome rush of events, happenings, and information that could have easily been spread throughout the first half of the picture. Viewers not devoted to action are likely to turn the movie off before the plot even gets rolling on account of this overload. Additionally, the film's 'twist' - what the kidnappees are used for - elicits a resounding ""yeah, right"" from all but the most passive viewers, considering how the movie delves into sci-fi territory after more or less playing it straight for the first hour. Production values are pretty strong for the most part (some of the 'underground' sets aren't entirely convincing) and the acting's about as strong as it's going to get for this movie, so count your blessings.

Yes, do count them, but people who appreciate raw physical talent will run out of fingers to list the highlights of the film's ample fight scenes. Love or hate choreographer Panna Rittikrai but don't ever say his work's unoriginal: the man who made his name finding ways to kick butt in manners audiences have never seen outdoes himself yet again with roughly eight jaw-dropping brawls. The fighting style alone is worth the rave: calling the fictional Meyraiyuth method a synonym for capoeira is nonsense, considering its evolution throughout the movie - beginning as a crass mixture of drunken boxing and breakdancing, it takes on elements of capoeira for the middle act before becoming a completely untaggable hodge of muay Thai, kung fu, and judo. Jeeja struts her stuff, but she's perfectly complimented by the likes of Patrick Tang and first-time stars like Nui Saendaeng, Sompong Leartvimolkasame, and ex-policewoman Jindasing Roongtawan as the evil mastermind - all of whom deserve their own starring vehicles as far as I'm concerned. Up until now, I was convinced that the Cynthia Rothrock/Karen Sheperd encounter in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Above-the-Law/dp/B000NVT0RK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Above the Law</a>&nbsp;constituted the single best fight between two women in all of cinema, but the Yanin/Roongtawan finale easily puts that one to the test: what we have here is a new standard that will be very, very difficult for other movies to live up to.

I could go on about this one, but it eventually boils down to this: casual viewers will probably hate the plot and deride the length of the fight scenes, while action appreciators who aren't intimidated by the sight of a woman kicking butt will have plenty of reason to cheer. Fans who lament the loss of Tony Jaa will, in a pinch, find a suitable replacement in this young lady from Bangkok and her new vehicle; if you sat through the silliness that was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ong-Bak-2-The-Beginning/dp/B002XTXGA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ong Bak 2: The Beginning</a>, you can certainly stomach this one.",1298505600,9,4556,5.532281205164993

4153545,4,B003LN0NXC,"JeeJa Yanin has had an auspicious start to her martial arts movie career.  Her first film Chocolate (2008) was a solid martial arts film that showcased her ability and allowed her to downplay acting by having her being mute.  She gets to talk in this film and is generally fine with her acting abilities, but her strong points are still her martial art abilities. JeeJa is the most exciting female martial artist in cinema right now.  While that might not be saying much, I do find her fun to watch.  Much like Tony Jaa, I feel with the right script both could do much more than with the material they are currently given.

Raging Phoenix succeeds on the action scenes but ultimately fails in the plot.  JeeJa is Dea a confused slightly erratic woman down on luck with choosing boyfriends, removed from the band she was playing in because of attacking that boyfriend during a performance and of all the luck she is now targeted to be kidnapped by a gang called Jaguar who target specific smelling women who will be harvested of their pheromones to sell on the black market as a sex aphrodisiac.  That just sounds silly doesn't it?  Wait it gets better.  She is saved by Sanim (Kazu Patrick Tang: Bangkok Adrenaline) a practitioner of a martial art called Meiraiyuth who is part of a group of marauding good guys who have lost their significant others to this nefarious gang.  These include three others named Pig Poop (Nui Sandang), Dog Poop (Sompong Leartvimolkasame), and Bull Poop(Boonprasayrit Salangam) NOTE: I modified the names for Amazon.  She then becomes their student in learning this martial art to use in destroying all of these kidnappers and in search of the head of the serpent of the gang played by Thai/Indian bodybuilding champion (and once was part of the Royal Thai Police) Roongtawan Jindasing in her first movie appearance. Of course she has to survive the training which involves imbibing much liquor and getting beaten up.

The first fight scene is partially impressive. I love the use of modified powerisers the bad guys have which are like a pogo stick per leg but longer and built with blades.  I was skeptical at first, but it came out quite creative and entertaining.  I would love to have those, though I would probably kill a few people while learning it and potential decapitating myself.

While the use of wires to accent the fight scenes is overused, they do help create an aesthetically pleasing martial arts style in Meiraiyuth.  It is a mixture of drunken boxing, Muay Thai, break-dancing and Capoeira.  While it may not always be advantageous to throw in a dance move while beating someone up it is impressive here.  One problem that occasionally comes up is that when doing extremely flexible moves at impossible angles the impact of the blow comes off as very soft and the overreaction of the opponent is forced though I have seen this issue in many action films (as well as the mysterious blow that completely misses the person yet that person is blown over by the wind of the punch or kick).

But besides the plot I have one other issue that annoyed me.  Some of the CGI use is pretty bad.  This is especially evident when they are trying to break into the lair of Jaguar.  At its worst is when they initially break in and fall or ""slide"" down to the lower depths.  They basically looked like they were moving their arms and legs while the background is changing.  The bridge fight scene is also hurt by this where much around them looks like they are in a computer game from the mid 1990s.  When you watch something as impressive as the few fight scenes you wonder why they resorted to this phony graphics manipulation.

I have to admit I had a fun time watching this movie.  The story is not as solid as Chocolate (though better than Ong Bak 2) and like many Thai action films they feel derivative (or homage) of other successful Asian films especially ones from Hong Kong.  The incorporation of Meiraiyuth reminds me quite a bit of drunken boxing and it is impossible not to think of Drunken Master.  Early on the manipulation of Deu's body as a weapon by Sanim certainly reminds me of its use in Dirty Ho, but a few Jackie Chan films as well. The film seemed to completely forget the drinking part of the art in the later part of the film.

Rating is more like *** (for Amazon, but since it does not allow halves).

I have the Magnet R1 release.  It has two main extras: a ""Making of Raging Phoenix"" and ""Behind the Scenes of Raging Phoenix.""  The ""Making of Raging Phoenix"" (11m. 53s) is in Thai/French with removable English subtitles.  It is a fun extra though you wonder how/why the director Rashane Limtrakul spent a year writing the script.  Patrick Tang speaks French in the extra.  The ""Behind the Scenes of Raging Phoenix"" (10m. 35s) is pretty much showing them practice the fighting scenes (and some drum training) to a Thai(?) rap beat.  However like in the end credits of a Jackie Chan film you get to see mishaps and the dangers of this type of film when JeeJa Yanin hurts her neck and gets put into a brace.  And to top it off it has the international trailer (3m. 34s) of this film and various trailers ""Also From Magnolia Home Entertainment.""

It kept kicking me out.  So Ii guess I wasted the money for the rental because I still can't get it to play. Not happy at all.",1513814400,2,346,3.8450704225352115
