This computer help DVD is ***guaranteed*** to get people comfortable with using a Windows Vista computer.

This ""computer class you can watch on TV"" was created by an experienced adult services librarian and computer technologies instructor (Me).

I taught basic computer skills to adult learners from 1997-2007 in various public and academic libraries. During that time I learned how to effectively teach the computer shyest of adult learners.

Computer Comfort is my ""intro to computers"" class in a box.

This program utilizes colorful graphics, still photos, screen recordings and video to gently get your ""computer shy"" friends and/or relatives up to speed with a Windows Vista computer in the comfort and privacy of their own homes.",1247011200,,954,5.291390728476821
