4515780,3,B0050MB5KM,"Contact is was the BEST of these. Lost in space is pretty cool but a bit old now. Red Planets ok. Sphere is almost a complete failure. Pretty good package except for Sphere.
6/10",1341532800,4,178,4.264705882352941
4515781,4,B0050MB5KM,"This was a pleasant suprise for a multi-pack.

The four discs in the package appeared to be original pressings not double sided re-do's.

All four movies are high quality with special effects and excellent storylines.

Sphere was awkward to load, it kept going through all the voice overs with the lead actors at first, eventually the movie played in superb widescreen definition.
The discs all have the extra feature sections and trailers one expects from higher quality original releases.

All the movies were hits if not exactly blockbusters in their year of release, and the aspects that made them so remain true today.

The jellyfish scene in Sphere, the acting in Contact, the landing and fire scenes in Red Planet and the explosion of the recovery vessel and robot in Lost In Space are still quality special effects.

If you like Sci-Fi and enjoy good stories, even far fetched ones put into a believable format you will enjoy these.

If you're a science purist there are areas where these push the envelope and that might detract from what you get.

In the end they were all enjoyable and well presented, a purchase I certainly don't regret.",1323734400,26,1149,4.826530612244898

4515821,4,B0050MB5KM,Contact is good sci-fi. It tells the story of making contact with alien life. As always Jodie Foster is brilliant. Lost in Space is a re-telling of the old tv series Lost in space. This versions differs greatly but it is a good sci-fi. The Red Planet is about astronauts who go to Mars to find out why the terraforming of that planet isn't producing oxygen. The mission is one surprising incident after another with the astronauts fighting for their lives. The end is a nail biter and it is as riveting as the rest of the movie. Great Classic Sci-Fi. The Sphere takes us to our own ocean. There has been less exploration on our own oceans than outer space. The crew and the unexpected events keep you on the edge of your seat throughout this movie.,1454457600,2,748,4.427536231884058

The second movie  was in its own rite a great movie because of the forward thinking and attempt at making it seem like it could really happen someday. Acting was great and the idea was far in the future but gave the audience the idea that it could be performed now with the right technology. A movie that you will not leave you unimpressed.",1449014400,2,536,4.203883495145631

Lost in Space is notoriously bad, but it's right there in the ""so bad it's good"" category.  I haven't yet watched the other two on this one, but they both sound dangerously cheesy. Altogether a good deal, even if the packaging leaves a little wanting.  It's a single-stack of DVDs, so it's a bit of a pain to find the movie you want out of it.",1439769600,6,441,4.365853658536586
