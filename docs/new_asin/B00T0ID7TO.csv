8700084,4,B00T0ID7TO,"I love Korean cinema and this movie does not disappoint. Very much referencing the old ""spagetti westerns"" and reflecting similar themes, style and music this film on the whole well put together, filmed and acted. I felt the narrated sections clashed a little, always favouring the ""show, don't tell"" philosophy in film making but this didn't diminish my overall enjoyment of the film. Good fight scenes with an actual solid story",1461628800,,430,5.070422535211268
