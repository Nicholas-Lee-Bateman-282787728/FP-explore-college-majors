8756187,1,B01DKNSPYG,"The original title was ""When the Sky Falls."" Nothing to see here.

This film follows the standard Asylum formula for disaster films. Create a disaster, divide a family, re-unit the family and only dad can save the world. In this case the disaster is ball lightning taking place in Minnesota, or ""northwest of Wisconsin"" as they say in the film. The cause is ""compromise in the flow of protons from the sun"" whatever that is. The family consists of the moody teen, redhead mom, dad's mousey girlfriend, frustrated dad with a bad walking stick, and a son stuck in the 80's.

On the plus side I did learn that the rubber tires are of no use during a lightning storm, but the car acts as a Faraday Cage, diverting lightning away from the occupants providing they are not touching anything metal...and the windows are up.

The film used unconvincing actors with boring dialogue.

Made for TV.

Note to self: During a lightning storm avoid metal junk yards to prevent getting a Darwin Award.",1468022400,,985,4.670520231213873
