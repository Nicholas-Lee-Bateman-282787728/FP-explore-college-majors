7816670,4,6301813731,"Saw this many years ago on USA Cable's ""Up All Night"". Cheesy acting, cheap special effects and a plot that's pure nonsense. In other words, a great drive-in movie. Easy to see why no one in it, including Sylvester Stalone's brother Frank went on to anything else. None the less an enjoyable way to waste an hour or so of your time. Video quality is pretty good, audio clear and crisp. Not up to Bluray but way better than it looked on cable or VHS. Movie itself is much better than I remembered it.",1436313600,,499,4.319148936170213
7816671,3,6301813731,"I just wanted to clarify that this DVD listed here is region 1, and not region 2 as listed by Amazon next to the photo of the DVD cover at the top of the page here. If you scroll down to where the other info is about the movie, you'll see that the region code is correctly listed.",1398729600,,280,3.8448275862068964

The story? Forget it. The picture quality? Well, its an old movie but ok (only 4/3)",1359676800,,156,4.233333333333333
7816673,5,6301813731,"This is the perfect mind-blank film.  There are a load of comic stunts along with funky comedy and parody that only the dullest of minds would fail to appreciate.  ""Run for your life, Helen!""",1333152000,,191,4.588235294117647
7816674,3,6301813731,"Three stars are pretty far in my book. The movie is plain nonsense but actors play well, everything in right places and first half is where we should stop. No nudity whatsoever. Plot? What is plot?",1254700800,,197,4.5

7816676,5,6301813731,This is a sexy sci-fi comedy about a pink meteor landing in a small town and making the women there very sex starved. It's a hilarious must see!!,1107302400,,145,4.214285714285714
