7672438,4,B01C5R3B8S,"Land of Mine (2015 release from Denmark; original title: Under sandet, ('Under the Sand'); 100 min.) brings the story of a group of German POWs in Denmark. As the movie opens, we are reminded it is ""Denmark, May 1945"", right after the end of WW II. We get to know Danish Sgt. Rasmussen, who--after violently lashing out against German soldiers leaving the country--is assigned to de-mine an area on Denmark's western coast. Apparently the Nazis anticipated a possible invasion there, incorrectly as we all know. Rasmussen gets the help of about a dozen German soldiers who are ordered to actually do the work. When the soldiers arrive, it turns out most of them are just boys. As the Germans are trained on how to de-mine, one of them accidentally detonates a mine and dies. At this point we are a good 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is a high-profile (more on that later) and expensive (for European standards) production that brings to the big screen a post WWII episode not well known by the public at large (in the movie's end titles, we learn that more than 2,000 German soldiers were involved in this enormous mining clearance project). The movie's underlying tension (namely, at any time one of those landmines may detonate when making a minor error) rarely lets up, keeping us at the edge of our seat. On top of that, there are several outright brutal scenes involving Sgt. Rasmussen's attitude towards the boy soldiers (it somehow reminded me of the first half hour of Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket). All that said, while one certainly may have empathy for the boy soldiers as a group, I found it difficult to have the same emotional investment for the individual boys, as frankly they all seemed interchangeable to me within the movie's context. But in the end, this is an eye-opening movie on many levels. Danish actor Roland Mller in the role of Sgt. Rasmussen is nothing short of extraordinary.

""Land of Mine"" received immediate critical acclaim upon its release in 2015 and in fact was nominated for the 2016 Best Foreign Language Movie Oscar, yes, LAST year's Oscars. I have no idea why this movie is just now opening up in US theaters, but better late than never I suppose. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at in Ft. Myers was attended very nicely, much to my surprise. If you are interested in a slice of WW II history that you may not be familiar with, I urge you to check this out, be it in theater, or later on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Land of Mine"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1489881600,40,2681,4.654008438818566

7672443,5,B01C5R3B8S,"Land of Mine is a great sometimes Danish but mostly German language spoken (English subtitles) movie that covers aspects of World War II and the aftermath years that we the allied countries sometimes like to pretend didn't happen or that only the Japanese and Germans acted this way.  It highlights that war develops a lot of hate, and racism towards those from the enemy nation. Not sure if the actual characters in this film are true (I'm guessing they're not) but we do know that over two million mines were cleared by German boys (the adults all would have been killed earlier in the war and those that weren't gone back to Germany to fight to the death for each town as the allies moved towards Berlin, leaving boys as the only ""soldiers"" available to be the occupying force, most who would have been under 10 when the war started) who were not allowed to go home after the war, until all the mines were cleared by digging them out of the sand and defusing them.",1518739200,,967,4.494318181818182

7672452,5,B01C5R3B8S,"An important and sad film inspired by real events that tells of German prisoners of war sent to clear land mines in Denmark after World War II. Approximately 2,000 German soldiers, including numerous teenagers, were forced to remove mines, with nearly half of them either dying or losing their limbs to explosions.  I don't understand why they did not use mine flails (tanks with a device mounted on front designed to destroy mines) which were in production at the time.  Mankind's' cruelly to each other and desire for revenge will never make sense to me.  The film, directing, and acting are all very well done.",1515024000,2,613,4.819047619047619

7672472,5,B01C5R3B8S,A very good Danish movie. Could only find the DVD through rental but it was worth buying on Blu-ray.

7672517,5,B01C5R3B8S,"I haven't seen a movie that hit me this hard since 'Stand By Me' and it's one of the few WW2 films that aren't all ""muh evil Germans"".

These Germans weren't evil, they were just boys conscripted into the war. But since they were ""just"" boys, no one really gave a shi+ about them and chose to see them as just more evil nazis. Never-mind that most of them were around 9 or 10 when the war started.

Anyway the film was great, extremely sad, but great. As mentioned above, it's not another evil Germans ww2 film. The story starts just after Germany surrenders. In Denmark there are over 2 million mines planted on the shore (where Germans were anticipating an invasion) that need cleaned up. Disgustingly, since even boys are seen as disposable, Denmark military chooses to use them to clean up the mines. Some gruesome and sad moments, the scenes that hit me the most are the one's with the brothers and the first boy who sets off a mine. The worst scene is about 30 minutes in.

It's also not low budget if anyone is worried about that. Sadly it didn't make nearly as much as it should have so I decided to buy it. Also, all of the one star reviews are raging that it's not in English. Yea...read the description before purchasing maybe? Don't give an excellent film that documents the horrors that many boys face in war, a one star review because you didn't read the description.",1501113600,3,1381,4.450592885375494

7672536,5,B01C5R3B8S,"This is a foreign film directed by Martin Zandvliet that is a magnificent exception for World War II movies.  It is based on and inspired by true events.
On the Atlantic Ocean coast of Denmark, 2 million land mines were planted for an invasion that never happened.  Young German POWs, who grew up in the Hitler Jugend (Youth) in the Wehrmacht were captured.  Before returning home, the German POWs had to removed all of the land mines with little or no training.  The irony that held my attention throughout the movie was the Danish military were the perpetrators of inhumanity while the German POWs were abused as prisoners.  ""Land of Mine"" revealed the untold story about young German boys as POWs captured were forced into overwhelming odds in Post WW II, and not allowed to return home until the land mines were defused and removed?!  The Director explains the Danes and Germans in government contributed funds to make this movie about 2,000 German POWs given this inhumane task that killed or maimed half of them in explosions while removing the land mines. This is a movie that is a plea for humanity in each of us never to be forgotten.  Some of the Danish soldiers, especially the Sargeant found their humanity.  Director Martin Zandvliet declared the message is clear:  When fighting the monster do not ruin the victory committing the same crimes like the monster.  I was a Major in the U.S. Armed Forces and this movie gave renewed meaning to the Nuremberg Code of 1947 that emerged from the international war crimes (IWC) tribunal held in Nuremberg, Germany by the WW II Allies during the 1940s.  I rate this move with 5 stars and state this movie should receive the Oscar from the American Academy!  Well done!",1498694400,,1722,4.741610738255034

7672538,4,B01C5R3B8S,"A very good allegorical film about the aftermath of World War II in Denmark.  Young German soldiers, the majority of which were young boys, simply due to attrition levels in the German Wehrmacht, were retained by the Danish forces to remove mines from the beaches. Of course, the hatred for the Germans is made clear in the beginning of the film, when a Danish Sergeant pummels a Germain soldier for retaining a Danish flag on his person, perhaps as a war souvenir.  Even though the movie was professionally filmed, it was totally predictable.  There is not much to go on here when the young boys are to clear mines from the beaches.  One sees elements of starvation, bad treatment, death by the simple fact of working with mines in a sand and seawater area, the mistakes of youth and mistreatment.  The sergeant mistreats the boys in the beginning, then redeems himself in the end.  That's really the premise of the movie, which is hatred for the Germans, then mitigated by the fact that they are only boys who really need to go home to their families. So, to recap we see elements of extreme hatred for the Germans, and once you spend time with them, you see that they are only young boys who have all of the aspirations of youth. All is fair in love and war, and this film gathers those elements together nicely and provides great cinematography to boot.",1498348800,4,1357,4.586776859504132

7672543,5,B01C5R3B8S,"There have been countless WWII films through the years and it is always amazing to find a little known aspect of the brutal war. LAND OF MINE tells a heartbreaking and thought provoking story set at the end of World War II in Denmark. After invading Denmark, the Germans planted hundreds of thousands of mines along the Danish coast in anticipation of an Allied invasion that never took place. Denmark was mined more than any other European country.

After the war ended, it was decided that German prisoners of war would be forced to removed all of the mines before being allowed to go home.
Here is the tragedy of the story and a moral dilemma that has no answer. The Danes were angered and bitter with the Germans. Forcing the Germans to remove the mines might make sense but at a high moral cost. LAND OF MINE tells a fictionalized story of one Danish sergeant supervising a group of young German soldiers in a quest to clear on beach of mines. Most of these soldiers are teenagers who probably had little to do with the brutality of the war and only wanted to go home to their parents and loved ones.

The Sergeant is brutal and ruthless until he begins to see the everyday humanity in the soldiers who just want to go home. There is a beauty and sadness to diffusing  any one of those mines would be fatal. It's a given that few, if any, of the young soldiers will survive.

Although this story is fiction, the facts are real. 70,000 German prisoner of war soldiers removed mines and facts are given as to how many survived and made it home. It's rare to see German WWII soldiers portrayed with compassion and as human beings just wanting to go home. We're seeing a different side of World War II in LAND OF MINE where the defeated German soldiers are now the victims. LAND OF MINE is an amazingly thought-provoking look at other consequences of war.",1498176000,12,1856,4.482248520710059
7672544,5,B01C5R3B8S,"One of the best foreign WW2 movies I've ever seen. It's up there with Europa-Europa and Run boy run. The movie is based on true events. Captured German teenage soldiers, some seemingly more children then men. They're ordered to clear minefields left from the German occupation of WW2. There's a sense of conflict of feelings. On in side is making the Germans accountable for their crimes during the war and the other side is a understanding of the innocence of youth. These very young soldiers paying the debt of a past generation with their lives before they've had a chance to live. Good movie.",1498089600,3,596,4.740384615384615

7672546,5,B01C5R3B8S,"Some of the other well meaning reviewers don't get it - primarily because they are not familiar with events in 1940 during WW2.  In this movie, the roles are reversed.  The post-war Danish military (wearing British uniforms and driving American jeeps) acts like stereotypical Nazis - brutal and unfeeling at first. The Germans -  mostly kids who are NOT professionals - are objects of sympathy.  Basically, the film depicts the role reversal  between 1940 and 1945.  Surprisingly, this is one film I was sympathetic toward the Germans.",1498089600,11,535,5.091954022988506
7672547,5,B01C5R3B8S,Fantastic film that grinds on the unfairness of war. The stress put under these young boys must have intolerable. The question I have is why cant they have used the SS to do the work. These young men were just another victim of the NAZI propaganda and in many cases didn't have a choice in being a soldier. As far as I'm concerned the allies involved with this mine clearing task should have been court marshalled and shot for war crimes. The other question I have is where the hell were the mine detection devices for Gods sake it would have cleared the 2.5 million mines in a fraction of the time. This film does bring on the mixed emotions of an unfair treatment in an unfair war and this does point to the anger associated with the occupying Germans who did there fair share of atrocities. I was very pleased with the ending and the Sargent.,1497744000,5,845,4.388535031847134

The need for others to feel the pain we once felt is a never ending maze that spirils uncontrollably into a pit of madness.

7672550,5,B01C5R3B8S,"WW2 in Europe is over and a group of German soldiers is selected and sent to the Danish coast to find and disarm thousands of landmines placed there during the war.  They are despised by their sergeant and the locals who view them, at first, with total contempt.  Indeed, conditions at this outpost are dreadful - deliberate starvation, brutal reprisals, sickness that wastes them away and the ever-present threat of death while searching for mines.  The situation that faced ethnic Germans after the war is an ethical nightmare.  It's hard to feel sympathy for people who supported one of the worst regimes in history.  And the victors often felt justified because of what they had suffered.  At the same time, the atrocities committed by the freed countries - things like this (based on actual events) - often came terribly close to duplicating what the Nazis did.  This film is quite shrewd.  It lays bare the behavior of both sides and then steps back.  It leaves the interpretation to the viewer.  The acting and the writing is exceptional (though I disagree with the ending).  The cinematography is beautifully done and the direction is sharp.  I highly recommend it.

The story is a sad one: after WWII, thousands of German POWs are detained in Denmark to clear over 2 million land mines.
