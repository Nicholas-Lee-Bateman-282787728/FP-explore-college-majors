1340972,5,B00004CW84,"""We are bound together forever"".  These words are spoken by Dianne, the lover of David Graham.  Sounds like an innocent enough statement, doesn't it, especially considering that Dianne and David are high school students.  Quite the contrary!

Dianne and David are two teenagers with much promise.  They are honor students who each plan to enter the military after graduation.  However, when David indulges in a liaison with a schoolmate, Dianne's anger will result in heartbreaking consequences.

This film is truly chilling because three lives were ruined for nothing.  I never dated in high school, so I don't know how accurately the film portrayed high school romances.  The ""love,"" (I'm using this term with some hesitation), between Dianne and David seemed very extreme and a little unbelievable.  I think this fact is true because Dianne's love borders upon obsession.  How truly tragic that so much promise was lost.  As teenagers, do we even know what true love is? The fact that this is a true story makes the events that unfold much more chilling.

The acting in the film is very good.  Holly Marie Combs turns in a wonderful performance, and the other performers are good as well.  Please give this film a chance.  God bless you all.",1320364800,3,1244,4.93719806763285

1340975,5,B00004CW84,Bad choices were made and now 2 young people are in prison for life.  They had such promising careers and they threw it all away for vengeance and murder.  A beautiful young lady gone forever how sad!!!,1211328000,2,202,4.4324324324324325
1340976,3,B00004CW84,"Holly Marie Combs plays driven high school senior Diane Zamora who conspires with her boyfriend David Graham to viciously murder Adrienne Jones (Cassidy Rae of the short lived ""Models Inc.""). Adrienne was a track teammate of David's who had the audacity to have sex with David when he and Diane were briefly estranged. School ends and the couple go to their respective schools (Diane to the Naval Academy in Anapolis and David to The Air Force Academy in Colorado), bonded together by their twisted love and shared secret. As police are baffled without a clue as to who killed Adrienne, one of the duo slips up, causing cracks in the shaky foundation of their relationship.

This was an okay dramatization of the infamous Zamora-Graham trial; I thought the actors looked far older than the characters should have been. Some of the acting was a little overwrought. But the story is compelling and sad since it is based in fact. The two had everything to live for and chose instead to destroy three families.",1187654400,8,1006,4.815028901734104
1340977,3,B00004CW84,"LOVE'S DEADLY TRIANGLE: THE TEXAS CADET MURDER - The small-screen melodrama Love's Deadly Triangle: The Texas Cadet Murder first premiered on Monday, February 10, 1997 on NBC, and now arrives on home video in this release, under the title Swearing Allegiance. The picture dramatizes the infamous Zamora-Graham 'crime of passion' that unfolded in Fort Worth, Texas in 1995, whereby teen lovers (and soon-to-be naval cadets) Diane Zamora and David Graham viciously murdered Adrianne Jones, a local girl to whom Graham had given himself sexually. The incident inspired numerous articles including a September 1996 New York Times piece by Sam Howe Verhovek, and the cover story of the December 1996 Texas Monthly. The telemovie opens with Jones's body discovered beside a road, dead from gunshots to the head and several blows with a blunt object. The police question numerous suspects, before landing on the two culprits: Zamora (played by Holly Marie Combs) and Graham (portrayed by David Lipper). At the time of the arrest, Zamora and Graham are enrolled, respectively, in the U.S. Naval Academy and the U.S. Air Force Academy. E.T. mom Dee Wallace Stone co-stars as Jones's mother; Richard A. Colla directs, from a script by Steve Johnson. (AMG)",1161302400,11,1245,5.23

7920506,3,B00004CW84,"This one of those movies that start off with a scene showing what happens a fair way into it.  So you know after a minute or so which character you're now watching is murdered, and which characters murder her.  You're just left with why?  It's a pretty weak reason too, I don't know if this is based on a real life murder as it isn't stated, (spoilers follow) but it seems as if one moment the girlfriend is a smart intelligent nice girl, the next she just wants someone dead, someone who did nothing to her.  Yet she doesn't punish her boyfriend at all.  Surely if someone is pyschotic enough to kill a girl who didn't even know her boyfriend was in a relationship, then said boyfriend would have received a fair amount of violence when she learns of what he did.

Not a lot of point to having the socially disabled student as a potential suspect, when the movie had already shown the boyfriend and girlfriend killing the girl.  The police procedures in relation to that guy would have got him off if he was guilty anyway as soon as it went to court. Plus I hardly think you tell the mother of the victim her daughter is dead the way one does. The most clever part of the writing was the Greenish Brown Female Sheep line the couple say to each other that translates to Olive Ewe.  But overall this was a pretty bad movie, with both murderers confessing to different characters to try and give us a weak reason for the murder rather than having the police characters do research as to the motive.

Like most made originally for TV movies this one is anchored by a well known face actor from a popular TV show (in this case Holly Marie Combs from Picket Fences that ended the year before).  You'll probably recognise  David Lipper and Cassidy Rae for stuff they've been in as well who play the boyfriend and victim.",1464048000,,1814,4.401197604790419
