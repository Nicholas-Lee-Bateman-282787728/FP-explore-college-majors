8081148,4,B000AYYJP8,"Cult visionary Jess Franco directs one his best (late) movies making of this wild plot, complete of 2 wrestling prostitutes, some rabid bisexual vampires, a morbid messiah looks like a blond, fallen Archangel (handsome Domiziano Arcangeli), and, a mad professor who's from his Transylvania's castle, trying  to start off the Crusades again (but this time in Satan's favor) a true gripping piece of a kaleidoscope, rich with stylized visuals and always capable to amaze with their counter culture over all direction. Ironic, erotic, poetic, foolish and horrific : it manages to be sublime.",1449964800,2,588,5.32258064516129
8081149,1,B000AYYJP8,"I love Jess Franco's work, even the low-budget late career efforts. But ""Red Silk"" - a revisiting of two female sleuths from late 60's films ""Two Undercover Angels"" and ""Kiss Me Monster"" - suffers from bad dialogue, bad cinematography, bad acting, bad sound, bad....everything. One of the ten worst movies I've ever seen.",1321574400,2,321,5.0754716981132075
