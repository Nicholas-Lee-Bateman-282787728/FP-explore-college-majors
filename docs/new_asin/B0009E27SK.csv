2280341,5,B0009E27SK,"I have been a fan of Troma since I was 6 and I'm 24 now and still am a huge fan. It's because of movies like Toxic Avenger that I wanted to get into the movie making business. I've had many ideas in the past, but never really knew where to go after I had the ideas down in my head. All that has changed because of the Make Your Own Damn Movie set.

  This DVD set is a blast to watch all while learning alot of important information about making movies and what it takes to make a movie. There are plenty of interviews, making-of documentaries, and words of wisdom from Lloyd Kaufman himself.

  Besides this set, I also own the Cinemaker DVD set and I have to honestly say that Make Your Own Damn Movie is far better than Cinemaker. Yes Cinemaker pretty much teaches you the same things, but they are really serious when they are talking and if you are a first time film maker like myself...you can easily get lost with what they are saying. Lloyd Kaufman does a great job at getting the main points you need to know out in a simple way that anyone can understand...all the while making the viewing experience a fun one too.

  If you are thinking about getting into the movie making business, I highly recommend this DVD set to start off with. You won't be disappointed.",1177027200,3,1272,4.2887029288702925
2280342,5,B0009E27SK,"Even if you don't make your own damn movie, this box set is insanely valuable.  Interviews with some of the greatest screenwriters, directors, and producers.  I think someday people will look back on these candid conversations with some truly great filmmakers and it will be considered a great piece of film history.  I'm not being silly.  Some amazing tidbits of Hollywood history roll out on these discs.

Whether you want to direct, write, act, or create special effects, this box set is well worth your time and effort.  All presented with Lloyd Kaufman's usual wit and charm.

Plus you get some boobies thrown in.",1172707200,5,618,4.884615384615385
2280343,5,B0009E27SK,"Definitely not the usual prima donna-type instruction course! It's not step-by-step, either. You learn by observation. This shows you that film making is not out of the reach of ANYONE!

Funny and inspirational! BUY IT!",1170201600,2,219,5.257142857142857
2280344,5,B0009E27SK,"I can't speak for everyone, but this is an extremely useful and entertaining DVD set. If you're thinking about making a movie, this is an aid that you really do need. LK informs in his stylistic humorist way, but the information is there. But I find it so much better than a straight boring teaching aid that doesn't relate to real world pitfalls.

Troma, in my opinion is the best source to guide you to Make Your Own Damn Movie. LK has been doing it for more than half my life, and now I Make My Own Damn Movies.

I haven't read the book, but I'm about to order it right now. If being an independent film maker is what you do, or intend to do. Trust me, get them both! You can't go wrong. Thanks LK, keep doing what you do!",1168128000,2,725,4.098591549295775
2280345,5,B0009E27SK,"Much like the same titled book it the DVD gives a great insight into making your own movies. Lloyd goes out and interviews some big names in Horror such as Eli Roth and George Romero as well as other non-horror genre Directors. He provides real world examples from Troma Team and other movie productions he had worked on or with using footage from video diaries he created while on site. He also includes two documentaries ""Apocalypse Soon"" which is about the making of Toxic Avenger IV and ""Farts of Darkness"" which is about the making of Terror Firmer. I would highly suggest buying this DVD if you are interested in creating Independent films.",1167868800,2,646,4.725663716814159
2280346,5,B0009E27SK,"MAKE YOUR OWN DAMN MOVIE

This will without any doubt for a long time to come be the most important release of this century for anyone who is even remotely interested in the wonderful world of independent films. Of course, primarily, this set is aimed at those amongst us who have ideas about making a film of their own, but were disencouraged by the fact that the entire market is dominated by only a few big conglomerates which only care for the big bucks and not so much about artistic value. Indeed it is impossible to even dream about making something that resembles your own idea if even you have the odd chance of finding some access into that world to begin with. Independent is the word, and much contrary to popular belief a lot of independent films are being made still, the DVD market being a very important factor in all this, because the theatres are owned by aforementioned conglomerates. Troma is (as anyone should know by now) the best, longest livingindependent studio, and the best example of the fact that there is definitely a market for real films, made by real people who love films, for the sheer love of the matter.

Lloyd Kaufman's MAKE YOUR OWN DAMN MOVIE book already gave a lot of insight in the possibilities (and the troubles that have to be overwon) of making one's own movie, and this 5-DVD box set is an invaluable companion release. Although the box mentions that the running time is appr. 12 hours it is in reality something about 18 hours in total, and it offers an immense collection of examples, insights through on-set recordings of quite a few different independent films, tips from renowned filmmakers who made it (Sam Raimi, Trey Parker, Mat Stone, George A. Romero Games Gunn, Eli Roth, Jenna Fischer, to name but a few) and hig- and lowlights from Mr. Kaufman's own 30-plus years of experience in making independent films. What you get is very important advice from those who know how it works from the inside. This is not the regular linear boring list of rules, this is quite the opposite: how to survive in the guerilla way of filmmaking where nothing is linear. And the set gains a lot of quality and importance from just that construction, because instead of dry lessons that most of the time can't be related to reality we get to see how others did it and actually made it, and where others failed and how you could avoid the same mistakes.

The book was quite unputdownable, this set of dvd's is very much unputoffable. Once you start exploring the set there is no way you can simply turn it off without thinking ""let's check just one more item"" every time. A few items have been released earlier as extra's on deluxe versions of dvd releases of certain films before, but many might have missed out on those, and even if that is not the case having everything here in one easy-to-handle collection is superb. The inclusion of an early Kaufman film (Battle of love's return, decribed by another reviewer as terrible) is extremely important, because the audio-commentary provides a workshop deconstruction of this film, making it clear where things can go wrong. An added bonus is the fact that this important film is finally available on DVD here.

But even if you don't have any plans to make your own film, the set is highly entertaining for those interested in the long and unique history of the only surviving REALLY independent filmstudio there is, and for anyone interested in what goes on behind these sometimes forgotten beauties created outside of the Hollywood system. It shows the love for film of so many people and the troubles they have to and are willing to go through to make their dream come true. An infinite number of discs of this content couldn't be enough to satisfy my hunger. As it is this generous set is absolutely the best, most entertaining and most informative Filmschool available anywhere.",1151366400,16,3871,4.696612665684831
2280347,5,B0009E27SK,"I've made several short films and am venturing into feature film territory. Even though I thought I knew everything there was to know about making and selling films (at least on a small level) I am the first to admit I was wrong. I'm a long time fan of Troma and picked up both the `Make Your Own Damn Movie' book by Lloyd Kaufman and then the DVD set mainly because I was just a fan. I was surprised that I learned quite a bit. The documentaries give you a good idea of how hard it is to make a movie and the interviews give you a lot of good tips when it comes to selling your film. My main gripe would be that some of the interviews were done using the camera microphone so on some of them it was hard to hear all of the audio.

If you're looking for something on the art of filmmaking then there are plenty of other places to look. If you're looking for something that gives you a good idea of the hard work that goes into making and selling movies then I highly recommend this set.",1144454400,2,986,4.056410256410256
2280348,5,B0009E27SK,"Some of the best and most practical filmmaking advice around.  And the ""Making of"" documentaries are informative and hilarious.  (Yes, you can find them on separate movies, but that does not detract from their value as learning tools and entertainment.  Those Troma sets are nuts.)",1143504000,2,281,5.2
2280349,3,B0009E27SK,"This has 3 full-length materials already available on other disks.  I already have all three of these and most Troma fans would at least have the Making of Terror Firmer documentary if not 2 or all 3 of the these.  A big percentage of the 5 disks is wasted on content already available.

It also has the entire BATTLE OF LOVE'S RETURN movie which was terrible although you can turn on the commentary of Lloyd Kaufman so I guess that counts for teaching you to make your own damn movie.

The rest is different interviews and documentaries of other filmmakers, video makers, writers, special effects artists, cartoonists, theatre owners, video store owners, etc.

It is nice helpful information but I don't see how it could all add up to really teaching you how to make your own damn movie.

However, it is a nice collection of stories/experiences/how-to's by various filmmakers of varying types.

I wish they had not included the already available material and that Lloyd himself would instruct different aspects along with his humor such as he did in the books.  Maybe taking 5 disks for this.

And include the other artists segments and putting it on maybe 3 disks.

Get the books first.  They are excellent.  This box set is nothing like the books but still helpful although disappointing.",1119398400,28,1291,4.791855203619909

Lloyd Kaufman will help you with this fnatastic box set and show you fantastic was to keep things cost effective as well as sharing his vast knowledge from over the years creating some of the most beloved and memorable B-movies in the world.

There are plenty of examples of what to do, and what not to do on actual shoots, and some cringe worthy. Of course this 5 DVD set has the  usual Troma absurdities like extreme violence,random nudity,sex scenes, and outta control ""Acting"" . Lloyd Kauffman is great at self-promotion which is a main point that most filmmakers shy away from. There are a lot of laughs to be had, and a color coded system to keep track of interviews or of categories like, ""Financing your Own damn Movie"". There are plenty of great interviews throughout with George Romero, Matt & Trey Parker from South Park, James Gunn, Stan Lee, Eli Roth etc. This is exploitation at its finest! And as an aside , if you love Toxic Avenger, there is a great Book of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Toxic-Avenger-The-Novel/dp/1560258705/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Toxic Avenger: The Novel</a>&nbsp;that's excellent. While watching all these amateur and professional shoots, it really drives home the message to get it made no matter what!

2280463,1,B0009E27SK,"This was a complete waste of money. I have just finished making my own movie and Lloyd offered NOTHING much that was really helpful.

I have been a fan of Toxic Avenger and Lloyd's crappy movies, but this set is not worth the money for what little educational value it offers.",1209340800,4,374,4.434782608695652

2280465,1,B0009E27SK,"Utterly useless. I will summarize the ""secrets"" of this DVD set:
1) When doing ADR, use a microphone.
2) When recording sound for your movie, don't use the microphone on the camera because it sucks. (Kaufman then goes on to record all 5 disks with the camera mike.)
3) People are stupid and will work on your movie for free.
4) People are stupid and will pay $50 for 5 DVD's that are only useful as coasters.

I don't think Kaufman edited any of this garbage. I believe he just popped a tape into the crummiest video camera he could find and then just let it run. When the tape was full he transferred it to DVD and gave it a random title like 'Lighting Your Set'.

Most of it is him driving around or walking around, getting lost and every dull moment is on the DVD. It seems like hours of that. It's like getting stuck in a car driven by your senile grandfather - funny for about 30 seconds and then you realize it's a 7 hour trip.

Kaufman's camera work can only be described as if it were shot by Katherine Hepburn, doing the cha-cha during an earthquake. I'm not sure if I vomited from the motion sickness or the content of this DVD set.

2280468,1,B0009E27SK,This is more like a complaint. I was shocked to see lewd scenes/nudity in this series. I wanted to present this dvd set to kid. I changed my mind. The whole presentation of this series looks like for dimwits who haven't gone to school in their entire life or can't make efforts to read better movie-making books. The duration of this series is too long. There are few tips about movie-making that can be covered in a 4 page blog with demo videos.

8059265,5,B0009E27SK,Really enjoyed the fun way to make a film. Went to film school over 15 years ago- pre digital movement and decided it was too expensive to try to direct my own films. Now I saved enough money to finance my own damn movie.,1418860800,,221,4.045454545454546

8059268,5,B0009E27SK,"Lloyd Kaufman is a loon. He's also a filmmaker, writer, and all-around decent guy. He manages, in his own twisted Castskills comedian way, to get across the fundamentals of GETTING the film made, not necessarily how to implement the ""rules"" of filmmaking such as shot selection, etc. You can study film theory all day, but this tells you how to put film theory to use.",1364947200,,368,4.676923076923077

8059270,5,B0009E27SK,"Being a fan of Tromas work, I was quite delighted to see this.  But trust me, this box set is no ground breaking insight into making your first movie.  It's more a fun behind the scenes look at how Lloyd runs Troma and how things work in ""his"" world of movie making.  Granted, he does explain some aspects of the business and presents good examples of ""Indie"" film making but there is not enough detail on how to really get it done.  The layout of the DVD menus are not the most user friendly and it just gets more disorganized (a direct reflection of the Troma way) as you progress through the disks. I could go on but... long story short...

If you Love Troma, corny FX and know who ""Toxie"" is = You Must Get It!!!!
If you want honestly want learn how to make your own DAMN movie = You Must Skip It!!!

Short clips of B/S that is apparently directed at a certain group of film makers that I'm not familiar with. I'm new to film and it wasn't helpful to me. I mean, he shows you how to steal props from the trash bins of CBS or one of those corporate conglomorates. I wonder if he thought, at all, about his targeted audience. I have no access to any such place to get props. I think the other posts pretty much sum up why this video is almost completely a waste of time. I'm giving it a 1 because I think most people look at the 1's and 5's. It really deserves a two because somewhere in all the superfluous information is a grain or two of somethin helpful. Even if it was intended to induce a creative process in which to obtain materials and make a film, it's an epic fail.
