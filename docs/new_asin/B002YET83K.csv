This information is directed towards Africa, but can actually be applied to all hunting rifles for anywhere in the world.  This is an excellent top notch video, a must have for any serious hunter.  This video is extremely useful, whether you plan to hunt in Africa or not. If you love to hunt, buy this video.",1299369600,2,430,4.545454545454546

But He did deliver in this DVD of his on rifles to take to Africa . It is just packed with a lot of very good looking and very expensive rifles and the bullets that go with them.
  Some of which I would not shoot on a drunken bet as they are way out of my recoil range of my shoulder by the way. There is also more than enough of shooting and killing of the local critters to satisfy the most blood thirsty of arm chair hunters who will never see Africa. So if you want to see the SPCA, PETA or Handgun Control worst's nightmare than this is the one to go & see.",1266969600,3,696,3.86013986013986
