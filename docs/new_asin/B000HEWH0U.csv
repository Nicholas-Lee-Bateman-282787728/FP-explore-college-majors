2637214,5,B000HEWH0U,"The ""Inspector Lynley Mysteries"" series is currently one of my favorites in this genre (murder/mysteries) I own all of the seasons including, of course, this season four.  It truly has gotten better and better with each consecutive season. Season, four, to me is the very best so far.  The primary reason for the aforesaid feeling is that Inspector Lynley's sidekick, Barbara Havers as played by Sharon Small is maturing into a wonderfully astute detective.  I've always admired the character of Havers with her ""salt of the earth"" wisdom and common sense; however, in season four, she really has come into her own--very wise, very knowledgeable and physically very beautiful.  In other words, she holds her own with the character of Inspector Lynley as played marvelously by Nathaniel Parker; plus she has become an indispensable partner to him and perhaps a future love interest (Thank god, that dreary wife that he's so in love with has sort of disappeared).  In the episode `The Seed of Cunning"" Havers proves her worth.  That episode is ""nail biting"" good!

Yes there is the preverbal ""cliff hanger"".  Lynley, this time is the one in trouble!

I loved Season four of this series--it is sooooooo good!",1164585600,15,1205,4.985
2637215,5,B000HEWH0U,"Philip Larkin wrote that there are two kinds of people: ""book Bond"" lovers and ""film Bond"" lovers, and that these two warring camps of James Bond fans can't get along because they admire completely different Bonds. I think fans of Elizabeth George's Insector Linley books may feel the same about this cracking BBC series, but I wouldn't know.  I'm too enamored of these disparate characters, whose warts are becoming particularly prominent as their partership deepens.

Kudos to the screenwriters, who muscled up George's books, and drew out the underlying Havers/Lynley Non-Romance, the dead-ended pratfalls of which are beginning to take their toll on them--and others.  Lynley in particular needs a holiday, but he won't take one because--well, because that's how he deals.  Bad move.

Nathaniel Parker and Sharon Small make this could-have-been-wretched series so much their own it's breathtaking. They play it absolutely straight.  Fans have watched Tom Lynley cope with Barbara's snarkey, jealous, defensive jabs, and now they'll watch Barbara come into her own as Tom turns brittle after his baby's death.  It's all very melodramatic, but having been with them since the beginning, we are rooting for them more than I'd care to admit,even if Tom has to spend some time in the pokey.  Oops!

Fans can rejoice: #4 is as good--if better--than #1-3.  And as for #5: well, surely at some point, Tom and Barb will split a pint, turn on a bar or two of the fire, put their feet up, and talk.  But if they do, this wonderful, atmospheric series will be over.",1163116800,26,1557,4.996124031007752
2637216,5,B000HEWH0U,"This series has been steadily improving since its debut double-episode five or so years ago, and after the cliffhanger ending of Season 3 I was very eager to get my hands on Season 4. But as impressive as it has been up to this point, I was still not prepared!

As an avid fan of the British murder mystery genre, I have never seen a series improve so much in just one season, and I was a staunch fan before. Everything about Season 4 is extraordinary. The stories, the interaction of the characters which has made the show such a joy to follow, the magnificent acting of Parker and Small, the stunning scenery, even the cinematography has become more edgy and artistic. The series has reached entirely new and unprecedented heights. I would say it is now in a completely different league. Wow is an understatement!

I must nit-pick, though - what a shame that this perfection is not presented as well as it could be. Letterbox is a poor substitute for anamorphic widescreen, and it deserves better. Also some extras would be more than welcome. However, for the price, what you will get is certainly more than worth the money.

Despite the shortcomings of the set, the series itself is without flaw, comparable in quality (almost) to Foyle's War, and far superior to Midsomer, Frost, and all the rest of the greats in the canon.

If you are new to the series, I believe you will be enchanted on the merits of this season alone, but if you have been following it since its rather humble beginnings, you will be amazed. Season 4 is less ""gritty"" and more aesthetic than previous seasons, and has developed beyond the confines of E. George's (reputedly very gritty) novels into an entity all its own. Extremly well done.

And now - after a cliffhanger even more stunning than the last one - I eagerly await Season 5. I can't WAIT to see what they do next!!",1161648000,40,1853,4.5525525525525525

I believe Set 5 is the last in the series;  I'll buy this set before year-end.  My recommendation:  if you like British mysteries finely and intelligently brought to the screen with excellent leads and supporting cast, this mystery series is for you!",1344988800,,386,4.701492537313433
2637256,5,B000HEWH0U,"I'm new to the Inspector Lynley Mysteries (and just recently discovered Elizabeth George's Lynley novels) but was so captivated by the intelligent plots in the series that I've managed to watch Sets 1-3 within the past two weeks (thanks to my well-stocked local library!). The chemistry between DI Tommy Lynley (Nathaniel Parker) and DS Barbara Havers (Sharon Small) just gets better and better. I'm not talking about sexual chemistry here, though there's something there, just under the surface and barely perceptible. It's the pair's ability to complement each other in their line of work, tackling each investigation in their own inimitable way, and solving the most befuddling crimes.

At almost an hour and a half each, there are four episodes in this set:
In Divine Proportion
In the Guise of Death
The Seed of Cunning
The Word of God

I find this British investigative drama such a refreshing alternative to the same old, trite storylines found in many US crime dramas. Instead of focusing on the gruesome details, the crime itself is shown very briefly at the beginning, followed by the actual investigative process which plays out as a subtle exploration of human frailties, and provides deep psychological insight into the minds of the suspect/s, supporting characters, and main characters. Lynley and Havers have gone through a lot over Series 1-3 - Lynley's wife lost their baby, Havers got shot, yet these two individuals carry out their duties the best they can, even while battling their own inner demons.

I have to admit that my favorite of the two is Havers. There's something sweet about her, yet she is a tough cookie. That gentle smile and empathy that she shows for victims is in stark contrast to Lynley's no-nonsense manner. Lynley appears to be more taciturn and brooding in this series, but given what he's been through, that's probably quite natural. I'd recommend this series to anyone who appreciates quality crime dramas.",1317340800,,1951,5.052795031055901
2637257,3,B000HEWH0U,"Great story lines and fine acting, which is what we have come to expect from this series. But too many of the scenes are contrasty and dim, with the characters often merely shadows and recognizable only by their voices.",1310342400,,219,4.641025641025641
2637258,4,B000HEWH0U,"Again, I love the series and truly enjoyed every episode, which is why I purchased the entire series. I highly recommend the series for any fan of mysteries, especially British ones. Intelligent dialogue, scenic locations and the developing respect and admiration between the two lead characters make this a show worth viewing.
Again, the four episodes contain a mix of darkness and wry humor.
Again, Series 4 does an excellent job of continuing where Series 32 ended. Again, Sharon Small. presents an excellent and believable portrayal of the working-class detective without difficulty.  I agree with some other reviews that it is Havers that carries the show and Lynley in the process.
We get to see Lynley's relationship with his mother and sister, as he and Havers stumble upon a case while both happen to be in Cornwall.
If you enjoyed the previous series, or in British television, especially crime drama, don't hesitate to add this to our collection.",1267660800,,957,5.056962025316456
2637259,3,B000HEWH0U,"This season might as well have been subtitled 'Lynley: brooding and nasty'.  For the most part, his character is completely unlikeable.  Havers, again, carries the show.  Though, again, she's not the Havers I'd have pictured from the book.  With each series she gets prettier and far more likeable, and it's obvious she's the one with the real knack for investigation.

The mysteries themselves are still wonderful, with good plots and decent twists that keep you guessing.  Very much worth watching, especially if you can filter out a lot of Lynley.",1240963200,2,550,5.055555555555555
2637260,5,B000HEWH0U,"""The Inspector Lynley Mysteries 4"" contains some of the very best mysteries in the series for the aristocratic Inspector Thomas Lynley and his working class partner Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers to solve.  It also portrays a powerful if subtle evolution in their complicated relationship.

""In Divine Proportion"" features the return to duty of Havers, who was shot and badly injured at the close of Set 3.  She rejoins a partner still mourning the death of his child and his marriage.  Their case is the brutal shotgun murder of a woman who has returned to her rural village after years away at university and at work.  As the detectives dig into the murder, they begin to peel away the complicated history of the village, which hides a brutal secret and holds a deadly threat for the still shaky Havers.

""In the Guise of Death"" has Lynley returning to his native Cornwall, where he becomes involved in an apparent suicide that is soon shown to be a murder.  He and Havers work with the local police to unravel the connections between the murder and a smuggling ring run by an unlikely suspect, while Lynley wrestles with a family matter.

""The Seed of Cunning"" brings our detectives back to London, where a classified document missing from the House of Lords leaves behind it a trail of bodies.  Lynley and Havers soon discover they are not the only ones following the clues.  Their competition is powerful, ruthless, and perhaps beyond the reach of the law.

""The Word of God"" presents Havers and a Lynley cranky over a possible divorce with a body frozen inside a meat transport.  The body has a missing kidney, a false passport and a priceless page from a ancient Koran.  The clues lead to multiple suspects and additional murders.  At the end, Lynley must weigh procedure, and his career, against the life of a pregnant woman.  This last episode may be most notable, however, for a frank late night conversation between Lynley and Havers that is a remarkably honest statement of their nuanced relationship.

""Inspector Lynley Mysteries 4"" is very highly recommended to fans of this excellent series for its offering of tough and complicated crime mysteries and for the further exploration of a remarkable partnership that fans have come to treasure.",1225497600,3,2259,4.87434554973822
2637261,4,B000HEWH0U,"Inspector Lynley Mysteries Series 4 is comprised entirely of films that are not based on books or written by Elizabeth George. These four new mysteries pick up after Series 3's cliffhanger, in which Detective Sergeant Havers was shot. She's back on duty, and Lynley is estranged from his wife Helen. I've never liked the films' interpretation of Helen, so I was pleased to find her absent from this series. Lynley is becoming increasingly angst-ridden, and Havers departs more and more from the character of the books. But these mysteries are entertaining. ""Seed of Cunning"" is the most suspenseful Lynley film I've seen so far. Each mystery is 85 minutes long, and this series ends with a cliffhanger too. PBS calls this Season 5, and WGBH Boston calls it Series 4, so don't be confused.

""In Divine Proportions"" finds Detective Sergeant Havers (Sharon Small) recovered from her gun shot injuries and Detective Inspector Lynley (Nathaniel Parker) anxious over his wife's departure following her miscarriage. Interior designer Samantha Walthew (Louise Hickson) is shot to death on a property in her home village that she and her husband were planning on developing. The property's former owner, Philip Turner (Richard Armitage), had taken up with her. A belligerent old neighbor, Mr. Harris (Roderick Smith), doesn't hide his disdain for the Walthews. But the name of Ron Verger, a local man who disappeared some 15 years ago, keeps turning up in the investigation, and his departure seems to still weigh heavy on the mind of his son Billy (Burn Gorman) and Samantha's old acquaintances. There are a lot of emotionally overburdened characters in this one. It's quite the village melodrama.

""In the Guise of Death"" takes Lynley back to Cornwall and his family estate. While Lynley is visiting his family, horse trainer Stephen Fenner (Doug Rollins) is found hanged in the stables on a neighboring estate. The ambitious officer assigned to the case, DS Tremayne (Adrian Bower), welcomes DI Lynley's input. Lady Asherton (Gabrielle Drake) has invited Havers to stay with the family while she's on leave, so both Lynley and Havers are on hand to assist with the investigation. But they disagree over the direction of the case. Havers thinks the motive for murder came from the equine world and suspects fellow horse trainer Lawrence Chilcott (Nick Dunning). Lynley thinks the assailant is connected to the smuggling operation of boat repairman Lachlan (Doug Allen) that used Fenner's land. This mystery is entertaining and not too far-fetched, the second-best of this season.

Back in London for ""The Seed of Cunning"", the body of Eric Ramsey (James Pearse), a doorkeeper to the House of Lords, is found floating in the Thames. Lynley's aristocratic background prove both an advantage and a curse when he and Havers go poking around in the House of Lords and a nearby social club. Deep in debt from gambling, Ramsey had a falling out with straight-arrow Committee Clerk Geoffrey Crammond (Clive Merrison) over the disappearance of some important papers. Lynley's supercilious old rival from Oxford, Simon Featherstonehaugh (Roger Allam), has a seat in the House. And Letitia Gane (Claudie Blakely), lobbyist for an American defense firm, seems to turn up around every corner. Meanwhile, Havers is making an improbable attempt at a social life. The political intrigue may not be to everyone's taste, but this mystery builds suspense very effectively.

One page from a priceless 7th century Koran is found on the frozen body of Latif Ansari in ""Word of God"". Ansari was an illegal Jordanian immigrant whose forged passport leads Lynley and Havers to an uneasy collaboration with Immigration police. The precious page is authenticated by Islamic scholar Elias Blackwell (Mark Benton), who helps Lynley pose as a collector trying to purchase black market art from antiquities dealer Dimitri Zavos (Joseph Long). The dead man's wife Narima (Maggy Sharif) may unwittingly hold the key to finding the Golden Koran that everyone seeks. But the trail  also leads to a clinic where Latif was on a kidney transplant list. Frustrated by Helen's absence and his powerlessness on recent cases, Lynley is anxious, impatient, and about to snap.",1191715200,8,4225,5.162043795620438
2637262,4,B000HEWH0U,"I have very much enjoyed the Inspector Lynley series ...having watched all of them and purchased the DVD sets as well.  I really do think that that the actors and screenwriters do a very fine job of taking Elizabeth George's characters from books to film (I have not been able to read her novels as they are too wordy and have too many non-police-related detours for my taste).

In this collection, I think the first two and the last are solid entries.  If I had to pick the best, I think I would go with ""In Divine Proportion"" (good story of vigilante justice).

I do have one nit with ""The Guise of Death""...I felt that Lynley took unnecessary risks at the climactic confrontation with the killer that could have gotten him killed.

I have a bigger bone to pick with ""The Seed of Cunning"" (SPOILER ALERT)

I very much so felt that the resolution was terribly unlikely:

a.  I seriously doubt that the inspector would leave ca crucial piece of evidence in his car where it could be stolen by the bad guys.

b.  I TOTALLY disbelieved the idea that a prisoner who was an eyewitness to major corruption in the British government could be murdered in broad daylight by assassins masquerading as police officers and that would more or less end the story...If something like that happened, it would be a major, major, MAJOR news event, and I think the police and government would mount an enormous investigation to find out what happened.  This undermined what had been otherwise a good story.

But that's just one story being problematic.  The rest are good.  And I know I will buy the next Lynley set and the next (and final it seems) one after that, and then I will feel very sad, because that will be the last of Lynley and Havers I suppose.",1191024000,,1740,4.517571884984026

2637284,4,B000HEWH0U,"The Lynley series is satisfyingly ""safe"" yet interesting. The stories are good enough. The production values and acting are excellent.

  The formula is based on the class differences as they express themselves in England. Lynley is from an extravagantly wealthy family. He is the top dog and bosses around his equally bright partner, Havers. Havers is below middle class. They are both hard workers with tragic flaws around opposite sex relationships as well as taking risks in their jobs. Yet, because Lynley is an upper class male bossing around a lower class intuitive female [Havers] it appears that they have a working relationship that substitutes, poorly, for marriage. The working relationship is similar to the detective & sargent in the Morse series.

 Most the stories often take place surrounded by wealth, like the Colombo & Morse series'.

  Plots are fluffy, safe, & self-aware. My wife and I like to watch it before we go to sleep. It's interesting enough to keep us up and tame enough to be our ""nightcap"".
