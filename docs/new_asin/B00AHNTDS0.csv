8551710,4,B00AHNTDS0,"warning - This is the Spanish version and it doesn't play on our North American DVD player.

Jeraldine Mcewan (although not true to the character) is my favorite Marple. She makes the whole series a delight. The plots have been updated to include some modern spice. 4:50 from Paddington has a great lighthearted romance in it, as does Moving Finger and Sleeping Murder. Mcewan really lights up this edition of the Marple tales with the help of some great supporting actors. Thoroughly worth seeing. Just be careful to get the North American format.",1422662400,,548,4.89247311827957
8551711,4,B00AHNTDS0,"I have seen all three, not on blu-ray, but on Netflix and will definitely add this to my collection.  All three were very enjoyable.  I really miss Geraldine McEwan playing Miss Marple.  The series was not the same after she left.  If you just watch it to be entertained and not try to over analyze it you will truly enjoy several good mysteries.",1374537600,,346,4.444444444444445
8551712,2,B00AHNTDS0,"This is an easy review.  In spite of some really talented actors & directors the writers destroy many of Agatha Christie's wonderful plots, characters, and big denounements.
1) Almost all of the problems of this new series are caused by the gross liberties the writers take with the original Christie material.  Characters are changed, motives are changed, new (totally unnecessary) characters are added, and most importantly the big final denounements are either radically changed or absolutely destroyed.  Miss Marple actually sits back and lets other new characters explain the action and Miss Marple's thinking for her.  HOW ABSURD!
2) Acting is excellent; especially Geraldine McEwan.  Her take on Miss Marple does work.  I just tend to prefer Joan Hickson and the totally wrong but, oh so enjoyable, Dame Margaret Rutherford.  She is a blast. A HOOT!!!
3) Settings and locations are excellent as is the photography.  The BLU-RAY is also very fine indeed.
4) The directing is also very good and detailed.
5) You can watch and listen to this either in English or Spanish; so don't let the fact that this is produced in Spain deter you from purchasing this BLU-RAY set.
6) My only problem with this Set (and it is a big one for knowledgeable Christie Fans) is the totally insane rewriting of already great stories.  Many times these reworkings of the plots and characters are just plain silly, confusing, and ruin already at times classic endings.  It truly is a shame because Christie, the Cast and directors deserve better.
7) Lastly, even the excellent Dame Margaret Rutherford Set of four Miss Marple movies includes one story not written by Agatha Christie but, based on her characters not her plots - MURDER AHOY.",1365206400,2,1722,4.989510489510489
