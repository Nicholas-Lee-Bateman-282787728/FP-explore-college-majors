3061293,4,B00116VG3M,"Set against a backdrop of a Brooklyn school, this is a nice movie ostensibly about an unlikely friendship between two young teachers, one Muslim, one Jewish.

The central issue, superficially, is the question of arranged marriages, an historical and cultural tradition in both faiths, and how the bond of friendship between the two girls grow as the processes develop.

Of course the timing of such a movie is critical given the very polarised situation which currently exists in the Middle East. But there is more to it than that. We are reminded of the contrast between the unchanging requiremnts of ancient religons and the maelstrom of change within the postmodern secular American Society and the needs of children which transcend faith boundaries.

For me as someone not of either faith, the film is rather like lifting a curtain and getting a glimpse of something normally hidden from the eye. I find the structure of each of the families that we are shown are very similar. The antiquated family structure forged by pre-industrial and agrarian societies has adapted to the demands off the present and yet the role of the husband remains, relatively the same. There are a number of similarities in what we are presented with which suggest that the different religions are somewhat similar, although given the limited amount the viewer is shown, this demands further investigation.

A question arises as to how much of this film is an attempt to show the relevance of the role of family in each faith in the face of more 21st century living.

All in all in a nice kind of way it is a thoughtful sort of film although I would have preferred more of a cerebral challenging personally.",1203033600,5,1688,4.847222222222222
3061294,4,B00116VG3M,"'Arranged' left me with some tears in the end.  This is the kind of movie we needed in this difficult, complicated and un-settled time. I love this movie and grateful to 'Film movement' for supplying us such wonderful films.  I recommended 'ARRANGED' to anyone who loves ART and PEACE.",1201651200,7,285,4.795918367346939
3061295,4,B00116VG3M,"Synopsis: The '07 independent film `Arranged' is a thoroughly entertaining albeit simplistic story concerning two new elementary school teachers working in one of the poorer quarters of New York City. Both are from highly structured, orthodox religious traditions. Rochel Meshenberg (Zoe Lister-Jones) is Jewish while Nisira Khaldi (Francis Benhamou) is Muslim. When a student brings up the topic of religious hatred between these two spiritual traditions the question is posited, ""Is it possible for the two to become friends?""

As you probably guessed, that's exactly what happens despite the rather obvious disapproval displayed by their families. When Rochel and Nisira learn that both sets of parents are actively seeking arranged marriages for their daughters they discover they have more in common than they ever thought they would. Relying on each other for strength and support through the trials and tribulations of submitting to the customs of their religious traditions they find a friendship that transcends cultural differences.

Critique: `Arranged' held my complete interest from beginning to end. The relationship between Rochel and Nisira is beautifully and thoughtfully presented and totally believable. Some of the Jewish stereotypes are straight out of `Fiddler on the Roof' but other than that it's hard to find any fault here. I enjoyed every minute!",1200096000,98,1373,5.564593301435407

3061297,5,B00116VG3M,"A sweet movie, but not saccharine. Loved all the characters. The last couple lines were kind of strange. It was also kind of hard to suspend belief for certain aspects. Paras (paraprofessionals/aids) are not called teachers and they don't work off the clock or prep. And the para gave the student more help than he needed, always guiding him. He never swept with his cane. Why have the cane if not to teach independence? That was all distracting. But if you're not in special ed, it probably won't affect your viewing pleasure.",1509580800,,527,4.739130434782608

3061302,3,B00116VG3M,"Excellent acting by the two main characters is the only thing going for this movie.  The main problem with this movie is that every character outside of the two main characters is an exaggerated stereotype.  The stereotypical Jewish family, the stereotypical Jewish matchmaker, the stereotypical Muslim family, the stereotypical atheist School principal, etc.  The most ridiculous stereotypes were the failed matches: the overly talkative guy, the overly shy guy, etc.

This story is one that's supposed to be challenging our preconceived notions of Jews and Muslims, but instead the script writers seemingly put zero effort into applying to this to their own movie.

The two main actresses both did a fantastic job, and their characters were a joy to watch and had wonderful subtlety to them.  But it wasn't enough to cover up the complete lack of attention given to making nearly every single other character in the movie more than just a shallow stereotype.",1501891200,2,960,5.161290322580645

3061314,4,B00116VG3M,"I really liked the film. It's a light-hearted film with a good ending. It was unrealistic since basically both women were treated as chattel by their families held within the restrictive confines of their religious beliefs. However, the acting was good and it was a good romp through a romantic fantasy. Both ended up with nice guys, who were good looking, had the basic potential to make lots of money to support their wives in the style in which they were raised. Not to mention both guys were attractive enough to create an undercurrent of sensuality with their new mates. Yes, it was a fantasy in many ways, but in other ways, it showed that people could get along together quite well once the labels are removed.

3061370,1,B00116VG3M,"This movie had such potential, but it was so low budget that the potential could not be realized.

There were a lot of problems with this movie:

1. It looked like it was shot in one week. With a camcorder.

2. There were lots of unrealistic things.

a. The Muslim family spoke English at home. Not realistic. (They were said to have come from Syria as refugees. People don't switch languages all that fast.)
b. The Jewish and Muslim girl would both know their roles in (real) life and there would not be this much melodramatic introspection.
c. The Jewish men to whom the Jewish girl was introduced were exaggerated caricatures. (I happen to go to three different Orthodox synagogues on a regular basis, and most all the guys there are normal. We do have a couple that are ""off,"" but not nearly to the degree that all these men were.)
d. There were a lot of things that an Orthodox woman would NEVER do, such as allow someone to put body art on her. (Orthodox don't wear any type of body drawings because it can be connected to idol worship.)
e. The father in the home is not like any Haredi man that I've ever seen. He was completely clean shaven (not even a trimmed beard, like a Modern Orthodox would wear) and he was also so.......PC (""We don't use that word [shvartzes] in this house."")
f. The (Jewish) school administrator takes it upon herself to give money out of her pocket so that these girls can ""modernize"" themselves and told them that ""There was a women's movement."" (Can you imagine anyone at school trying to de-proselytize someone?)
g. The Jewish girl was very nice looking. Nice looking enough to need a security detail. What is the likelihood that she would be introduced to such a string of losers?

Verdict: Only recommended at the price of Youtube (free). I would not pay a single dollar to see this movie, and I see why it is free on Youtube. (They could not get anyone to pay for it.)",1483833600,3,1909,4.474137931034483

3061411,5,B00116VG3M,"This will never be a classic, nor a blockbuster, but it held some beautiful sensitive truths. There are plenty of synopses in the reviews, so I won't go through the plot, but I will say this would be a good movie to show in high schools, to facilitate understanding of the value of accepting all religions under our constitution. It started a bit after school movie-ish, but the main characters' subdued chagrin at their families' monomania, the misunderstandings of students, the total buffoon of a principal, quickly ameliorated that. It had a bit of a Hollywood ending, and a traditional message, that happy endings and getting married to one's prince are synonymous; however, the movie did not promise to be realistic, but to show bits and pieces of realism and good if sometimes misguided people, something sorely needed right now in this country.",1482019200,5,852,4.965034965034965

I myself am an Orthodox Jew, and while there may be some very small inaccuracies, for example in the children's Shabbat clothing, overall it's a genuine picture of the ultra-Orthodox lifestyle. I can only assume that it is as accurate on the Moslem side of things.
This is an enjoyable movie with an important message, as it raises awareness of what it truly means to be tolerant and open-minded. It manages to do this without ever coming across as preachy.",1481932800,3,554,4.663265306122449

3061676,5,B00116VG3M,"Oh my gosh -- the WORLD needs to see this film.  Of the several films I have commented on here, or seen in many a year, though other movies may have affected me deeply in other ways, THIS is the film I would pick if I were allowed to select just one movie everyone on the planet would have to sample.  ESPECIALLY everyone who lives in, or has been touched by the events or history of, the Middle East.  Or who has ever been associated with, or interested in, Islam or Judaism.  Or anyone who believes there must be Hope for bringing all peoples closer together, not further apart.  You will feel Hope in watching this movie, much Hope, just by enjoying a simple tale of Sisterhood between an Islamic elementary school teacher and an Orthodox Jewish teacher at the same school, both being prepared by their families for traditional arranged marriages.  In facing this challenging and uncertain time ahead, already friends as teachers, they forge a closer bond their respective families may disapprove of, in trying to face the events ahead, and possibly even find happiness.  Do not expect to be hit over the head with a sledgehammer; this is a subtle film in the way it flows, and shows us that the way the world can change is one small step at a time -- two people with heart first and foremost, trying to chip away at labels here and there while improving their lives and the lives of their loved ones.  What more could one ask?  This is how we will change.",1462579200,5,1459,4.475471698113208

The costumes were weird, antiquated, the women were all caricature of pushy Yentas from some Yiddish comedy and had no basis in reality. The dating process is unlike any Orthodox group I have ever seen. There is so much nuance that was missed but that I can forgive, the blatantly weird behavior of the Shatchanta was especially wrong. There was few 'full' time Shadchanim, most suggestions come from anywhere including friends and family.

It is sweet and insightful and funny. Two American women from different religious cultures become friends through their work in the classroom, then more deeply bound because they are separately enduring the pressures that family and religious culture bring to bear via the institution of arranged marriage. Their closeness evolves in a way that is altogether natural and human.

It's a wonderful distinctively American movie. Though the two young women come from different religious cultures, they have enough in common to forge a close friendship. There used to be a time when differences in inherited culture or religion and a good many other things didn't matter so much in this country--I grew up in that time, a descendant of some of the first people off the boat from England, and I've been fairly appalled at all the divisiveness that has arisen over things that don't matter for squat in the larger scheme of things.

My one caution, is that I had watched this to have a greater understanding of the culture of an Orthodox Jewish family and a Muslim family, yet there is a strong ""stereotypical"" use of ignorant and uncaring people that they come in contact with. The other teachers are shown as flaunting their sexuality (which was slightly offensive to me...in that I hope that anyone watching understands that not every non-Jewish or non-Muslim is like that.)

I don't want to know everything that happens in the movie before I watch it.

I do often read them afterward, however.
I noted that many of the negative reviews tended to pick apart details, feeling the movie was prejudice against this religion or that, or didn't go
into enough detail about one aspect or another.
This is not a college course on religions. I feel it's a very poignant movie, that packs a lot in only 1 1/2 hours.

It portrays two women, each trying to find a balance between their upbringings in strong, yet completely different religious faiths, with each faith conflicting with an American society, as well.

It's upbeat & charming in many ways (yes, more of a chick flick), yet thought provoking, as well.
Yes, it could have gone into much more depth into both the issues & the characters, but then it would have been a completely different film, & probably much 'darker'. That's not what I was looking for, but I enjoyed the fact this movie just cracked open a door enough to provoke some thought.

Both young women are lovely-looking and are presented with absolute duds for suitors but as soon as a good-looking young man shows up, they fall head-over-heels in love, give up their careers and become contented mothers.  How easy it is to make a good match!  This doesn't reflect the reality of anyone I know who has been in this situation.  I'm sure many arranged marriages work because of common beliefs, community and goals but I also know many that have failed.  The school principal in the film was totally unbelievable but she actually said a few things that made sense.  it's pretty hard to imagine an educated woman who interacts with the modern world being content to be a wife and mother only.",1437523200,2,891,4.784313725490196

Both young women find themselves teaching at the same public school, and being at the age when their parents are attempting to arrange marriages for them.  Of course, when one first reads the movie's description, it's easy to immediately assume both of these women are against arranged marriages, and are going to be battling their parents from start to finish.  But that's not what the movie is about.  Both Rochel and Nasira believe in arranged marriages.  However, they also want to be the ones to choose who they marry from the possible interviewees.

Rochel has the most turbulent time of it due to the combined involvement of her impatient mother, an aunt and a matchmaker.  Not only is this where most of the serious drama in the movie can be found, it's also where most of the humor can be found.  It is truly a delightful, intelligent and thought-provoking movie. I can't say enough nice things about it.  My only complaint is about the picture they chose to use on the DVD box, showing Nasira and Rochel sitting on a park bench.  This picture is from the final scene in the movie, and those who knows about Orthodox Judaism will realize from the picture how the movie turns out, at least for Rochel. They should have used a picture from a scene much earlier in the movie. Also, don't watch any trailers if you have not seen the movie.

3062105,4,B00116VG3M,"I loved this movie. It was an entertaining story of two very different women who are thrown together at work and then become friends and realize that they have a lot in common. As both women are about to be married by arrangement, they share their fears and frustrations and help each other, which was very sweet. It was especially touching the way that Nisera went out of her way to help Rochel to get introduced to Gideon, and she took no credit for it, she just did it anonymously.

I think that the movie should have explained a few things about each religion, instead of assuming that the viewer knows.

For example, why is it that Orthodox Jewish women cannot shake hands? Why do they wear wigs or scarves on their heads? Why couldn't Rochel's younger sister be included in the marriage meetings? Why was the little brother Avi so rudely excluded (""Hush"") so that he couldn't even ask a simple question? It was clear that Rochel's hair was untouched until she was married, and then she wore a scarf like the other married women. It could have been explained why Muslim women cover their heads but men do not. The ""voodoo"" scene with the red string around Rochel's wrist left me clueless. I am sure that many viewers did not understand the hand-painting. I would have enjoyed some explanation about the two religions and their marriage practices. When the principal was so rude and inappropriate toward Nisera and Rochel (many times), the movie could have used those opportunities for Nisera and Rochel to explain some things. At the end of a movie, I shouldn't feel a need to look things up to find answers myself, the movie should have explained more.

The two weddings at the end were just quick glimpses. I would have appreciated a little more of the two weddings, at the very least a good look at the two wedding dresses.

The very last scene was sweet, where Rochel and Nisera are sitting in the park with their baby carriages. I also wished that that scene was longer, with some details discussed about their weddings and married life.",1421280000,,2047,4.630853994490358

3062136,4,B00116VG3M,"I'm probably not going to say anything new (there are some great reviews here already) so I'll be brief: I liked this movie, but I had to turn off my critical thinking skills to enjoy it.

To elaborate: From a religious point of view, I found the discussion of WHY the girls observed certain customs entirely lacking. It's as if they had absolutely zero curiosity about each other, which, in my experience, is typically not the case when cultures collide. This is sad, because frankly, both Orthodox Jews and Muslims have some interesting things to say on the matter.

From a feminist point of view, this piece was predictably disappointing. Their whole journey seems to be about meeting gender expectations. Not once did either one mention or demonstrate a desire to have kids--and yet we move from meeting the man of our dreams to, in the very next scene, rocking babies in the park and making predictable, stereotypical jokes about their husbands. There isn't one scene about enjoying married life.

From a teacher's point of view, the principal--who obviously represented ""lapsed"" Jews--was ridiculous. Her comments to the two religiously observant leads does not demonstrate any level of education--nor political awareness! No principal would be stupid enough to put herself in danger of a lawsuit like that. Moreover, most non-observant people I know are incredibly intelligent, yet she was made out to be a foolish caricature of people who aren't as observant (read: good) as the leads.

The odd thing is that I enjoyed this film, the way I enjoy cheesy, predictable shows like Seventh Heaven or really any film from the 90s. It's comforting, and the two lead actresses were adorable. It was a cute friendship and ultimately, a cute film.",1412985600,2,1745,4.986254295532646

3062158,5,B00116VG3M,"""Arranged"" (2007 release; 89 min.) brings the story of two women, both of them new teachers at a local public school in Brooklyn. We first get to know Nasira, born in Syria and a practicing Muslim. We then also get to know Rochel (a/k/a Rachel), a Jewish-Orthodox woman born and raised in New York. They have their challenges with their 4th grade class, and perhaps because of it, develop a strong bond. Meanwhile at home, Rachel's parents are trying to find the perfect partner with the assistance of a matchmaker (""yentl""). In Nasira's world, it is her father who is doing the matchmaking. Will the women's friendship be acceptable to their respective families? Will they find ""the perfect partner""? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, the movie is beautifully co-written and co-directed by Diane Crespo and Stefan Schaefer. The movie feels very authentic, and at no time did I feel that the directors went out of bounds or purposefully played havoc with our emotions. Second, the movie is a brilliant display of what it means to be tolerant and open to the ideas of believers of a different world and religion. But even more than that, the movie also showcases the emotional toll that can be caused by these ""marriage arrangers"", be they the yentl or the father, while at the same time also making clear that these ""marriage arrangers""  truly have the best interests at heart of the young women, even if it isn't always obvious. Third, the two lead actresses are top notch. Zoe Lister Jones shines as Rachel (I remember her from seeing in ""Lola Versus"" a few years ago), and Francis Benhamou is just as good as Nasira. The chemistry between these two is palpable. I hated to say goodbye to these characters at the end of the movie. This movie should be required viewing for all high school kids in America.

This was released in 2008 on DVD by Film Movement as part of their growing library of foreign and indie movies, and as usual the DVD contains a bonus shortie.

3062205,4,B00116VG3M,"Good films aid and assist moral growth and individuation, and this beautifully done movie definitely qualifies as ""good film.""  The fact that it is a small-budget independent film shot in less than 20 days puts into shameful perspective how much time, money and human potential is wasted on idiotic big budget action films which rake in money but ultimately have (at best) no positive personal impact.  Yes we watch movies to be entertained, but good film edifies at the same time that it entertains.

That said, I didn't give the movie five stars because the ending strikes me as contrived.  First, it strikes me as highly improbable that the Jewish matchmaker would so readily accept matchmaking information for Rochel from a stranger (Rochel's Muslim friend pretending to be Jewish).  I guess it COULD happen, but -- again -- that plot turn greatly reduced the story's believability and began to make it seem more 'Hollywood fantasy"" than ""independent realism.""

Second, I was frustrated by the ending:  have they totally given up on their desires to teach school?  Are two such competent and strong women really content just to sit at the park with matching baby buggies and chit chat?  And I really didn't like Rochel's comment that as mothers they are going to have their families wrapped around their little fingers (or something like that) to signify that they are now changing into women just like their mothers.  I have always hated the stereotypical assumption that people 'inevitably' grow up to be just like their parents when they are adults -- that is SO untrue!  I am nothing like either of my parents, and no one who is truly an individual is going to end up living out a cultural stereotype.  I feel like the filmmakers sold out two well-crafted and believable characters by a formulaic, agenda-laden ending (IMHO).

Third, like Tom Hanks' character in the movie Big when he attends the Empire-State-Building-Turning-Into-A-Robot toy presentation, I have to admit that with respect to the Unity Circle activity:  ""I don't get it.""  Rochel uses the activity to teach 4th graders that people choose their own friends based upon individual characteristics -- and I guess that is her point -- but she also seems to teach that you can be accepted by almost anyone if you simply change (or repress) something vital about yourself (i.e., the child who self-identified as 'nasty' will likely be accepted back into the circle if he simply chooses a nicer characteristic with which to self-identify) . . . and, so, at the risk of looking stupid, ""I don't get it.""

I don't see how the Unity Circle adds anything to the class' understanding of religious tension between Muslims and Jews, when Nijera had already given an excellent explanation in class:  that there are millions of Muslims around the world of different nationalities, languages and beliefs, and that hatred is born of ignorance between people who do not try to understand one another.  She makes it clear (by implication) that she and Rochel are not the type of people to fall into the stereotype of Muslim-Jew mutual hatred -- and, again, I don't see where the Unity Circle added to that AT ALL.  Yet the film gives the impression that the Unity Circle activity was inspired, enlightened and explained why Rochel and Nijera are friends despite religious differences.

Those things said, there are many things I love about this movie.  For example, I agree with other reviewers who applaud this film for the very well done party scene:  Rochel has no interest whatsoever in engaging in immoral activities which violate her religious beliefs, and THIS I found to be realistic.  People with loose moral standards rationalize their behavior by telling themselves that ""everyone"" is tempted by immorality and that those who live a moral life only do so because they repress base (natural) desires through rigid self-discipline.  WRONG.

I also love the positive portrayal of arranged marriage because even though I am glad I had the freedom to choose my own spouse(s), I think a good marriage results more from the moral and loving attitudes and actions exhibited within the marriage itself than from any factors existing at the time two people meet and agree to marry.  Thus, two people who have a lot in common and good chemistry can end up in a horrible marriage if one or both of them choose during the marriage to adopt attitudes/actions/desires inconsistent with a good marital relationship -- and two strangers who start out with almost nothing in common can, over time, build a strong, loving relationship if they are both committed to doing so.

As a young girl I thought arranged marriage was right up there with foot-binding with respect to ""cruel human practices,"" but God challenged that idea by leading me to read Marjorie Holmes' beautiful novel 'Two from Galilee.'  Two from Galilee is the imagined love story of Mary and Joseph (parents of Jesus), but what struck me most was how Holmes imagined the love story between Mary's parents, who were strangers before being bound together by their parents via an arranged marriage.  I don't want to give any further spoilers, so please read this wonderful book for yourself -- especially if you profess Christianity.  It is a sign of the lost state of the organized church that Two from Galilee isn't even sold in Christian bookstores any more -- but I know you can buy it off Amazon.

The similarities between the two are surrounded on the fact that they are old fashioned, and hold on to an era gratefully forgotten. Both women of dating age must date, and marry the man that is chosen for them. Whether it is by Matchmaker, or Daddy dearest. They are both teachers, they both dress to religious specifications. They both get involved in the matchmaking process to assure their friend is not marrying a dog. ""Woof"" They both can not stand the person that is arranged for them to marry.

In spite of a long drawn out, bore fest. It fails in the script, however the acting is the only positive thing I can say about this yawn. If your into female movies with little to NO substance this is for you.

Taking place in New York young Jewish Rokala ""Rachel"" comes of age to marry. No sooner then her finishing school does her parents start throwing her in the dating pool. Calling all creeps, calling all creeps fresh meat here! The matchmaker, and her parents waste little time with a bunch of eligible bachelors. Geriatrics, Rude, pushy schmucks who don't ever stop flushing their toilet of a mouth. Men who's only hope for marriage outside of mail order brides, is the old fashioned custom of parents giving away their children for marriage to the guy with the most money, and success. Tell young Rachel that you don't have to look at him to procreate.

Her friend a lovely young woman whose name I did not care enough to remember. She is having similar problems with her family, minus a pushy matchmaker. Her dad sets her up with a plethora of men old enough to be her uncle, that want to pounce on top of her. She befriends Rachel, and both teach at the same school.

""Skip to scene"" where there Boss / principal get involved telling them to put on makeup, and offering a donation towards a new wardrobe for both of them. Instead of standing up for their rights, they bite their lip, smile, and decline the generous offer. The Principal gets involved a couple more times, and then finally Rachel tells her off.

They bring each other home to each respected families. ""Hi Mom, look what's coming to dinner."" The families act as you can expect, all uptight, and quiet. You can always tell a bigot, watch the body language, how they eye you for being different. Funny every ethnic race plays the race card. Kudos to the talentless list of C Grade actors making this a gem for the ages.

The fun starts when they both see an attractive guy for the other, who happens to be the right religion, and begin playing matchmaker.  Stereotype much director. Because there is a huge line between reality and fiction we get a happy ending.
They both squeeze out a few puppies, and have a picnic in central park.",1395619200,,2798,4.550695825049702

That said, I will admit that I'm mindful that I do wonder if it's an entirely realistic portrayal of arranged marriages. In both instances, parents were willing to accept that each of the female leads rejected potential suitors (albeit begrudgingly in the case of the Jewish woman). Spoiler alert:  In the end handsome, well-educated and perfect husbands arrived. As a film it's a complete and satisfying viewing experience. Not a criticism necessarily, but not being privy to the practice of contemporary arranged marriages I wonder if this is typical.

There's one complaint made by a few reviewers that bothered me too at first, but now that I've thought about it I think it makes sense. Namely, it is true that the Muslim family in this film is portrayed far more sympathetically and less stereotypically than the Jewish family. However, I think this is because of the structure of the film, which is somewhat incorrectly advertised as a movie about the two girls. It's really a movie about Rochel, with Nasira as the primary supporting character. That's why Rochel is the one who is doubtful and considers rebellion; that's why she is shown going on half a dozen horrible dates (exaggerated for humor, rather effectively) while Nasira is shown on just one, enough to show what she and Rochel have in common; that's why Rochel starts out as the demure girl whose character develops over the course of the film, while Nasira is self-confident and assertive from the start; and that's why Rochel's mother is so horrible to her (because, drama!) while Nasira's family is loving and supportive and would never dream of pushing her into anything she doesn't want. I did think it was a little ridiculous that Rochel's family was so mean to Nasira while Nasira's family was all just, ""Oh, cool, an Orthodox Jewish girl hanging out in our home,"" but again, I think that's because part of Nasira's role in the film is to be a girl from another equally strict religion who is perfectly happy with everything about it. This leads right into the ending, which is like everything else in the film - not overly dramatic or sensational, but extremely well-acted and a lot of fun to watch.",1358035200,4,1827,4.673913043478261

Sometimes I think us ""Western's"" have such a negative way of thinking regarding arrange marriages or having a matchmaker.  In any marriage you can have the potential of a jerk or a VERY unkind partner.  Whether you are picking out whom ever you think your partner should be, or you have some help.  However, too many times arranged marriages are looked upon by others who do not do this, as always being such a bad thing.  And I thought this movie was a great way to see the other side, that it is not always a bad thing.  And it was great that these families, lived in the USA.  Plus them being from different religions, made it nice to also bring up two types of religion that ""hate"" each other.  Yet show how in the end, we all are not so different.

That woman played her role very well---she really was obnoxious and annoying!  LOL!  Anyway, the reason for my review is to say that since everyone was basically dressed modestly in this movie (with a few minor character's being ""worldly"" that is) except for the one scene where Rochel leaves her parents' house and goes to see a ""renegade"" family member who no longer is with the Orthodox faith... Though it was nice Rochel had someone to talk to, the scene then has her going to a party with her relative and what ensues is your typical bumping and grinding to music and drinking and when Rochel tries to flee from a guy who is being a jerk, she opens one door to a group of people who are obviously doing drugs and offer her some.  Then she opens another door to bump into people vigorously making out.  The good thing about this is that if your DVD player has it so you can ""skip"" chapters or scenes, you can skip this scene as soon as Rochel leaves her parents' house, and the next scene is Rochel and Nisira talking at school.  It is very hard these days to find a movie of this caliber without something smutty in it, so just skip this scene and you will enjoy the movie more.

The high level of anxiety over the tradition of arranged marriages is evident and becomes a point of mutual frustration.  This challenge, together with the open-mindedness of these women, results in a lasting friendship.

I found this independent film to be an extremely refreshing break from the typical Hollywood blockbuster fare that is spun out over and over again.

3062371,5,B00116VG3M,"Loved this little filme by director Diane Cresco about a friendship between two deeply religious female teachers - one Jewish and one Muslim, but both agreeing to arranged marriages.  Although everyone around them [the principal of the school, students, their families] views their relationship as somewhat unsettling or unnatural, the women prevail in their close connection.  It is a sweet film proving that shared experience is what truly matters, not labels and politics.  As the women go on their quest for a family-approved husband we see them go on some hilarious dates and meet several amusingly awful prospects and sometimes get frustrated and hopeless - turning to brief scenes of rebellion before ultimately choosing to stay true to their tradition.

Zoe Lister-Jones and Francis Benhamou are perfectly cast, no action seems like a stretch, they fit into their respective characters with grace and ease.  Moreover, the women are strong lead characters - much unlike women's roles in romantic comedies where all they do is whatever their man wants (or whatever will get them a man).  Rochel and Nasira choose their own fates, despite having them arranged.  They make the decision to follow the tradition of arranged marriages and then they go on to decide who they will marry.

3062372,4,B00116VG3M,"I enjoyed this film and did not get bored watching it. I agree with most of the comments reviewers have made, including some somewhat contradictory ones.

The movie is well done but there are some awkward parts. It is definitely simplistic, does include stereotypes, and I did feel it presented the Jewish family in a less favorable light than the Muslim family. Anti-Semitism? Political agenda? Not in my opinion. Equality or acceptance does not mean everything has to be doled out in exactly equal portions. It's OK for a Jewish family to be shown to have more negatives than a Muslim family. That does not translate into ""all Jewish families are more controlling and less accepting than all Muslim families.""

As far as the lead characters making a ""choice"", well it's a limited choice. Nasira is never shown to question her beliefs or practices. Yes she gets annoyed at being asked to seriously consider one very unsuitable mate but that's about it.

When Rochel becomes distressed over her options, she goes to visit a cousin who lives a secular lifestyle and they go to a party where of course Rochel is extremely uncomfortable. Rochel's ""choice"" is made to seem very black and white--stay with what you know and accept a mate you may not want, or escape into the world, drink, do drugs, have wanton sex, and never see your family again. Those viewers unfamiliar with the culture may not understand that anyone who leaves their home and beliefs is declared dead, actually mourned the same as if they had died, and no one in their family will ever talk to them again. So ""choice"" is not exactly what you may be thinking. Most young people need a lot of help from family to get started in life and to do without that help and support can be an insurmountable obstacle.

I think ""choosing"" to be religiously observant is way overplayed. For most children in deeply religious families, leaving is unimaginable and would be incredibly isolating, and the option of staying but not following observant ways just doesn't exist. Could Rochel had stayed in her family and religion and just ""chosen"" to not get married or to date and pick out her own spouse? I don't think so. Could Nasira likewise have just decided to go out into the world dressing in a secular fashion while still living at home? Don't think so.

Well that's my soapbox. But that's why it's a good movie. It gets you thinking and talking about such ideas.

The part about the Unity circle was just awful. It seemed the worst possible way to try to teach inclusion--give people simplistic labels and choose to exclude or accept them based on the labels. Whatever message the movie was trying to convey was unclear to me--the awkwardness and inexperience of new teachers perhaps?

Another enjoyable movie that touches on these topics--solely from a Muslim point of view--is Sabah. It has its faults too, but includes some drama, some romance, and also humor. The scene where a girl is being pressured to meet a prospective mate is hilarious and how it plays out was very well done. Sabah shows more of a middle ground of staying in the family but the family evolving to accept some change.",1306713600,5,3152,4.730418943533698

It is another fine example of the possibility of quality film being made without a big Hollywood budget, and without super-star celebrity participation.

At one point I took note of the fact that I was lost in the story the film was telling, despite the lack of a manipulative, big-budget musical score.

The two main characters, Rochel, an Orthodox Jew, and Nasira, a devout Muslim, find that they share more in common with each other, despite their religious differences, than they do with the culture around them. While this film is certainly about the possibility of cross-cultural friendship between those at the extremes of different faiths, I found that it spoke to me more as an exploration of the possibility of faithful adherence to traditional values of any stripe in the face of modern pressures to acquiesce to the prevailing secular culture. The central struggle concerns the tradition of arranged marriage, a tradition that puts those who practice it squarely at odds with a modern society convinced there is only one way to find a mate. I felt these strong, young women's honest struggle as they tried to reckon with the pressures of the traditional faiths of their families, society, and their own personal autonomy.

What I especially appreciated about the film is that the two young women were smart, beautiful, and fully cognizant of their ability to chose a life for themselves. They realized that their adherence to the traditions of their faith was a conscious choice and a legitimate, though not always easy, one.",1299974400,23,1627,5.022222222222222

3062377,4,B00116VG3M,"A Syrian Muslim woman and an Orthodox Jewish woman begin teaching in the same school. As the title suggests, both of their families are in the process of finding the perfect husbands for them, and sharing stories of what they're going through with each other helps them bond. It's a sweet story that shows that while not all Jews and Muslims get along, there are many peaceful Jews and Muslims that are great friends.

The film isn't full of dramatic actions or insane plot twists, so if you're looking for that in this movie, look elsewhere. However, for an independent film, it is pretty charming. It is a simple and straightforward movie. The tribulations these young women go through, especially the Orthodox Jewish woman, are pretty funny. The women's friendship also helps them cope with the school principal, who ironically bullies them to be more liberal.

Oh, and it's also nice that this movie presents what an ""arranged"" marriage should be. Both women are presented with many choices for potential husbands; however, ultimately, they CHOOSE whom they want to marry, as in any other marriage. Arranged marriages should never be forced or pressured. On the other hand, one shouldn't criticize arranged marriages as long as the people who are in them are okay with them.

The two women are teachers. Jewish-Muslim prejudices show up even in the children. One Jewish boy thinks that the Muslims want to push Israel into the sea. Nasira, their teacher, points out that there are 1.5 billion Muslims of many different languages and cultures. No single Muslim can speak for all Muslims.

Rochel gets into conflicts with her parents because she has no feelings for any of the men that her parents have put forth. At one point, she leaves home for an evening to go to a contemporary party. However, the modern life is not for her. In fact, both Rochel and Nasira have a self-righteous feminist principal who looks down on them, accusing them of leading an outdated, repressed life, and telling them that women have been liberated. At one point, Rochel fires back: ""How is sleeping with a guy you don't even know liberated?"".

When the Muslim girl and her intended are sitting on the couch meeting her parents for the first time and deciding to go ahead with the match, they are portrayed as high-achieving and beautiful with a promising future ahead. I saw nothing in the film portraying Jewish culture in a sensitive way; quite the opposite.  The women (Rochel's mother and the shadchan, and Rochel herself) were portrayed as catty, sniping, loud-mouthed. The list goes on.

3062413,3,B00116VG3M,"I suspect other reviewers who have had only good things to say about this film are commenting only on its social message and not its value as a film, ie entertainment.

As a social message, it's a decent one:  Jews and Muslims can and do get along, and we have many commonalities.

I don't feel the Jewish community is well-portrayed at all, however, nor, perhaps the Muslim one, though I'm not familiar enough with Muslim families to say so definitively.  On the Jewish side, every ""character"" around the two women is a functional stereotype, intended to represent attitudes in their communities:  the religious Jewish mother, the yeshiva-boy brother suspicious of all ""goyim,"" the anti-religious Jewish principal.

These ""characters,"" though occasionally well-acted, are essentially cardboard cut-outs standing in for real, three-dimensional human beings, whose lives and actions are rarely so simple and direct.

The two lead actors are charming and well-casted and carry the film to its ultimately predictable conclusion despite these awkwardnesses.  But even their charm cannot mask what is a weird, stilted, and agenda-driven movie that falls far short of the gold standard of enjoyability.

""Arranged"" is a sweet, well-acted film about the relationship between two female teachers, one Jewish and one Muslim. Both women are raised in households with strong belief systems handed down to them by their families, and both women broke the cultural vice of presumed conflict and mistrust.  What I enjoyed about this film is that it was never over the top, and showed family life in these families in an honest and open way.  What made a mark on me also was the strong contrast in being raised within a family structure such as the Jewish and Muslim cultures, then being thrown into the unprotected, confusing contemporary world of sex, drugs and alcohol.

3062415,4,B00116VG3M,"This movie is essentially a chick flick with an added theme.  It involves two young female school teachers, an Orthodox Jew and a Syrian Muslim, who find that their conservative views significantly alienate them from the surrounding secular society.  Because of this similarity, they form a bond, despite the obvious religious tension.  The movie is a chick flick because the plot revolves around their parents trying to arrange marriages for them, a process that doesn't always go smoothly but concludes with a happy ending for both of them.

The added theme, of course, is the religious element.  The movie doesn't really go into the issues involved in the Jew/Muslim conflict, but the implied suggestion is that there may be enough common ground to overcome differences and history.  I don't know how realistic that message is, but I like the idea of promoting tolerance.  Another interesting and unexpected aspect is that the Muslim family comes across as more liberal and tolerant than the Jewish family.  Again, I don't know if this is realistic, but it's nice to see a portrayal of Muslims which challenges the ultra-conservative stereotype.

In the end, this isn't an overly deep or complex movie, but I like its positive and hopeful messages, and the acting is solid, so I recommend it -- and not just to chicks.",1274054400,13,1321,4.968181818181818
3062416,2,B00116VG3M,"As a way of introduction, I'd like to say that I have been a customer of amazon's for about 11 years and my decision to buy a movie, CD or book is often based on customer reviews. However in all those years I had restrained myself from leaving reviews of my own. I could go into a great deal of  dicussion as to why not, but that's not what this is about. The question I suppose is; why now?.
Well, about 20 minutes into this movie, I realised I couldn't let my son watch it. If rated, the movie would be appropriate for a general audience. It would seem that innocuous, except for the scene about the ""unity circle"". It makes no sense to me whatsoever that the character of Justin, a 9 year-oldish African-American boy who, up until the time of the enactment of the unity circle, had contributed to the introduction of the central theme of the ""strangeness"" of the friendship between a Jewish teacher and her Moslem colleague, should nonetheless be made to play the part of one who 'made the choice' to exclude himself from the circle.
Given the task of choosing just one word that describes him or her, of the children in the classroom, Justin it was that came up with the word 'nasty' to describe himself. As if this wasn't bad enough, there was not an attempt to explore with the child, why he would choose this word to describe himself. Instead there followed a vote to decide whether he should stay in the circle or not based on differing opinions about whether someone nasty should be part of the group - never mind the fact that he had not actually behaved in a way that would warrant a consideration of acceptance or exclusion. If Justin decided he would choose another word other than nasty he could re-enter the group. Subsequently there followed a brief didactic to the children on how we ""choose"" to be part of one group or not ... . The explanation was even more confusing than the procedure that came before.
At the beginning of the movie, the Jewish teacher's much younger brother had made a derogatory remark about 'blacks' that his father had chastised him about. ""We don't use those words in this family"".
One may have wondered what the significance of ""blacks"" is, in the very specific narrow context of the movie - the friendship between a Jewish woman and a Moslem woman. Perhaps the writers were trying to make the case for the idea that prejudice against blacks in this society is of there own doing. They make that choice. Unfortunately the manner in which it was conveyed only serves to perpetuate the negative view of the black male (in particular) in this culture. Justin is given the role of expressing a low regard of himself (as is perhaps the prescribed lot of the black child in America,) and yet up until the contentious scene, he had displayed a healthy curiosity about the friendship between the two women that ought to have been instructive in his own life, if the question was addressed with a more common sense response.",1272844800,11,2959,4.551594746716698

Both are being helped by their families in a search for the right husband and both have similar problems with choosing.

3062441,5,B00116VG3M,"An understated yet wonderful gem -- all the more impressive in light of its having been filmed in a mere 17 days!

This story -- of a warm friendship that develops between two women of very different religions yet not-so-different hearts and circumstances -- avoids so many wrong paths that lesser films might have (and all too often have indeed) taken. On the one hand, it does not romanticize sincere devotion as an always clear or comfortable path; and it vividly portrays both the humour and the frustration a younger generation may experience in receiving guidance from its elders. On the other hand, it does not condemn or even trivialize 'conservative' adherence to such beliefs and traditions.

I especially appreciated one episode involving a party, in which a young woman's reaction, to things so many today would consider normal social activity, is depicted neither as self-righteousness nor as weakness nor even as temptation-barely-avoided. She simply does not find that world attractive.  Indeed, far more of us understand her aversion than most of the entertainment industry usually recognizes. And when, later, she does pointedly 'take a stand', it is against someone whose pride in being more 'worldly' and 'sophisticated' was what had proved the REAL self-righteousness.

Ultimately, however, this is a story of affirmation, and a film both charming and fun.  The two central roles are played out perfectly -- blending humour, angst, intelligence, and 'spunk' in a way that is utterly believable.

The only truly misguided part was the role of the headmistress or principal, who I guess was supposed to embody all of liberal societal prejudice.  No educator in NYC would dare voice the types of complaints she does or be so insensitive.

It was an entertaining film, but things seem to get resolved too easily in the end. I was taken aback by the vicious guilt trip Rochel's (the Jewish girl) mother puts on her to get married through their system, immediately. Although the movie views this guilt trip through a comical lens, guilt tripping and trying to emotionally manipulate someone to that degree is really an abusive thing to do. I would have liked to have seen Rochel stand up to her mother more over this issue, but then of course her prince in shining armor enters the picture and rescues her.

Although the movie presents the arranged-marriage system in a positive light, you do get glimpses of the intense pressure put on members of these conservative religions to conform. If they don't it sounds like they are viewed as garbage. Eg, Rochel's mother implies that being unmarried past 23 (an old maid) is a tragic situation that's beyond the pale. And imagine if one of these girls got pregnant out of wedlock--it seems like the parents would most likely completely shun them, force them to abort, or maybe even kill the girl. The movie definitely makes me question how much parents in these cultures truly, unconditionally love their children (especially their female children).

Rochel is played by Zoe Lister-Jones who does an excellent job as a Jewish girl teaching in the public schools.  She helps a visually impaired student.  The uncertainty Lister-Jones shows as she sorts through a number of suitors including Daniel London's hilariously played nervous guy cameo as Elliot is entrancing to watch.  Finally, Rochel spots Gideon played mysteriously by Jason Liebman who catches her eye & then becomes the apple of her eye.

Nasira is played by Francis Benhamou who does an excellent job as the Islamic teacher at the same school where Rochel teaches.  As first teaching days sometimes go, one of the students demands to know if Nasira wants to kill Rochel because of their different faiths.  Benhamou does an excellent job showing a bit more assertive personality than Rochel and takes matters into her own hands to unite Rochel & Gabriel.  Nasira eventually is moved by Jamil played by Sanjit DeSilva as the two are united through the traditional channels.

Both the fathers are portrayed as loving and tender who truly care for their daughters.  This is one of the best aspects of the film.  John Rothman plays Matan who claims his blood pressure is going sky high because Rochel is not picking any of the husband candidates.  Laith Nakli plays Nasira's father Abdul-Halim likewise with a tenderness that makes us feel how strong the family bonds are.  Marcia Jean Kurtz also turns in a strong performance as Principal Jacoby who wants to get too involved in the lives of her teachers, but fails to respect the traditional cultures.

A class session raises the question from one of the students :How can a Jew be friends with a Muslim? and this sets the stage for the two women to come together and eventually form a close friendship.

Both Nasira and Rochel are from very traditional backgrounds and though their faiths set them apart from each other, it is also the strictures required by those faiths that bring them together and help them commisserate with each other - they are both in the process of being matchmade by their respective families to 'suitable' young men from their own religious backgrounds. Nasira balks at one of the suitors her father brings forth and Rochel finds herself being put in awkward 'blind dates' by her well-meaning but clueless aunt.

Yes, there are some sappy bits in this movie, but the portrayal of tradition is very credibly done, and the strong acting by the two female leads elevates this movie from just another social commentary. Having come from a very traditional family myself, I can relate to the emotional conflicts these girls go through, and though I rejected the pressures placed upon me, I can also understand and respect why these two young women chose to keep to their traditions and appease their parents.

In the society where women walk around with open back tops and other revealing clothes, these two young women are very traditional in the way they dress, carry themselves and interact with the people around them.  It is their differnece that gives them appeal, beauty and admiration of their students and superiors. Both of them are also of age when they have finished their education, they are both working and it is their time to leave their family home and start their own families.  We learn about intricacies of arranged marriages on both communities and struggles that they have coming to terms that his is a life long decision they have to make not knowing if they will have regrets later on in their lives.  I found story and deep personal connection between these two women to be genuine and sincere.  One cannot stop thinking what happens to their generations of daughters 20 years from now.  This is a moving film, although acting was not as strong as one would have expected.  Another wonderful gem from the ""Film Movement"" company.",1203379200,3,1362,4.886956521739131
3295790,4,B00116VG3M,"Set against a backdrop of a Brooklyn school, this is a nice movie ostensibly about an unlikely friendship between two young teachers, one Muslim, one Jewish.

The central issue, superficially, is the question of arranged marriages, an historical and cultural tradition in both faiths, and how the bond of friendship between the two girls grow as the processes develop.

Of course the timing of such a movie is critical given the very polarised situation which currently exists in the Middle East. But there is more to it than that. We are reminded of the contrast between the unchanging requiremnts of ancient religons and the maelstrom of change within the postmodern secular American Society and the needs of children which transcend faith boundaries.

For me as someone not of either faith, the film is rather like lifting a curtain and getting a glimpse of something normally hidden from the eye. I find the structure of each of the families that we are shown are very similar. The antiquated family structure forged by pre-industrial and agrarian societies has adapted to the demands off the present and yet the role of the husband remains, relatively the same. There are a number of similarities in what we are presented with which suggest that the different religions are somewhat similar, although given the limited amount the viewer is shown, this demands further investigation.

A question arises as to how much of this film is an attempt to show the relevance of the role of family in each faith in the face of more 21st century living.

All in all in a nice kind of way it is a thoughtful sort of film although I would have preferred more of a cerebral challenging personally.",1203033600,5,1688,4.847222222222222
3295791,4,B00116VG3M,"'Arranged' left me with some tears in the end.  This is the kind of movie we needed in this difficult, complicated and un-settled time. I love this movie and grateful to 'Film movement' for supplying us such wonderful films.  I recommended 'ARRANGED' to anyone who loves ART and PEACE.",1201651200,7,285,4.795918367346939
3295792,4,B00116VG3M,"Synopsis: The '07 independent film `Arranged' is a thoroughly entertaining albeit simplistic story concerning two new elementary school teachers working in one of the poorer quarters of New York City. Both are from highly structured, orthodox religious traditions. Rochel Meshenberg (Zoe Lister-Jones) is Jewish while Nisira Khaldi (Francis Benhamou) is Muslim. When a student brings up the topic of religious hatred between these two spiritual traditions the question is posited, ""Is it possible for the two to become friends?""

As you probably guessed, that's exactly what happens despite the rather obvious disapproval displayed by their families. When Rochel and Nisira learn that both sets of parents are actively seeking arranged marriages for their daughters they discover they have more in common than they ever thought they would. Relying on each other for strength and support through the trials and tribulations of submitting to the customs of their religious traditions they find a friendship that transcends cultural differences.

Critique: `Arranged' held my complete interest from beginning to end. The relationship between Rochel and Nisira is beautifully and thoughtfully presented and totally believable. Some of the Jewish stereotypes are straight out of `Fiddler on the Roof' but other than that it's hard to find any fault here. I enjoyed every minute!",1200096000,98,1373,5.564593301435407

Paras (paraprofessionals/aids) are not called teachers and they don't work off the clock or prep. And the para gave the student more help than he needed, always guiding him. He never swept with his cane. Why have the cane if not to teach independence? That was all distracting.

3295799,3,B00116VG3M,"Excellent acting by the two main characters is the only thing going for this movie.  The main problem with this movie is that every character outside of the two main characters is an exaggerated stereotype.  The stereotypical Jewish family, the stereotypical Jewish matchmaker, the stereotypical Muslim family, the stereotypical atheist School principal, etc.  The most ridiculous stereotypes were the failed matches: the overly talkative guy, the overly shy guy, etc.

This story is one that's supposed to be challenging our preconceived notions of Jews and Muslims, but instead the script writers seemingly put zero effort into applying to this to their own movie.

The two main actresses both did a fantastic job, and their characters were a joy to watch and had wonderful subtlety to them.  But it wasn't enough to cover up the complete lack of attention given to making nearly every single other character in the movie more than just a shallow stereotype.",1501891200,2,960,5.161290322580645

However, the acting was good and it was a good romp through a romantic fantasy. Both ended up with nice guys, who were good looking, had the basic potential to make lots of money to support their wives in the style in which they were raised.

There were a lot of problems with this movie:

1. It looked like it was shot in one week. With a camcorder.

2. There were lots of unrealistic things.

a. The Muslim family spoke English at home. Not realistic. (They were said to have come from Syria as refugees. People don't switch languages all that fast.)
b. The Jewish and Muslim girl would both know their roles in (real) life and there would not be this much melodramatic introspection.
c. The Jewish men to whom the Jewish girl was introduced were exaggerated caricatures. (I happen to go to three different Orthodox synagogues on a regular basis, and most all the guys there are normal. We do have a couple that are ""off,"" but not nearly to the degree that all these men were.)
d. There were a lot of things that an Orthodox woman would NEVER do, such as allow someone to put body art on her. (Orthodox don't wear any type of body drawings because it can be connected to idol worship.)
e. The father in the home is not like any Haredi man that I've ever seen. He was completely clean shaven (not even a trimmed beard, like a Modern Orthodox would wear) and he was also so.......PC (""We don't use that word [shvartzes] in this house."")
f. The (Jewish) school administrator takes it upon herself to give money out of her pocket so that these girls can ""modernize"" themselves and told them that ""There was a women's movement."" (Can you imagine anyone at school trying to de-proselytize someone?)
g. The Jewish girl was very nice looking. Nice looking enough to need a security detail. What is the likelihood that she would be introduced to such a string of losers?

Verdict: Only recommended at the price of Youtube (free). I would not pay a single dollar to see this movie, and I see why it is free on Youtube. (They could not get anyone to pay for it.)",1483833600,3,1909,4.474137931034483

3295908,5,B00116VG3M,"This will never be a classic, nor a blockbuster, but it held some beautiful sensitive truths. There are plenty of synopses in the reviews, so I won't go through the plot, but I will say this would be a good movie to show in high schools, to facilitate understanding of the value of accepting all religions under our constitution. It started a bit after school movie-ish, but the main characters' subdued chagrin at their families' monomania, the misunderstandings of students, the total buffoon of a principal, quickly ameliorated that. It had a bit of a Hollywood ending, and a traditional message, that happy endings and getting married to one's prince are synonymous; however, the movie did not promise to be realistic, but to show bits and pieces of realism and good if sometimes misguided people, something sorely needed right now in this country.",1482019200,5,852,4.965034965034965

I myself am an Orthodox Jew, and while there may be some very small inaccuracies, for example in the children's Shabbat clothing, overall it's a genuine picture of the ultra-Orthodox lifestyle. I can only assume that it is as accurate on the Moslem side of things.
This is an enjoyable movie with an important message, as it raises awareness of what it truly means to be tolerant and open-minded. It manages to do this without ever coming across as preachy.",1481932800,3,554,4.663265306122449

Wonderful acting by Principal Jacoby, the young almost blind student, the families.  The less-than-polished presentation made it all the more real.  Thanks for the bits of humor too.

Of the several films I have commented on here, or seen in many a year, though other movies may have affected me deeply in other ways, THIS is the film I would pick if I were allowed to select just one movie everyone on the planet would have to sample.  ESPECIALLY everyone who lives in, or has been touched by the events or history of, the Middle East.  Or who has ever been associated with, or interested in, Islam or Judaism.  Or anyone who believes there must be Hope for bringing all peoples closer together, not further apart.  You will feel Hope in watching this movie, much Hope, just by enjoying a simple tale of Sisterhood between an Islamic elementary school teacher and an Orthodox Jewish teacher at the same school, both being prepared by their families for traditional arranged marriages.  In facing this challenging and uncertain time ahead, already friends as teachers, they forge a closer bond their respective families may disapprove of, in trying to face the events ahead, and possibly even find happiness.  Do not expect to be hit over the head with a sledgehammer; this is a subtle film in the way it flows, and shows us that the way the world can change is one small step at a time -- two people with heart first and foremost, trying to chip away at labels here and there while improving their lives and the lives of their loved ones.  What more could one ask?  This is how we will change.",1462579200,5,1459,4.475471698113208

The costumes were weird, antiquated, the women were all caricature of pushy Yentas from some Yiddish comedy and had no basis in reality. The dating process is unlike any Orthodox group I have ever seen. There is so much nuance that was missed but that I can forgive, the blatantly weird behavior of the Shatchanta was especially wrong. There was few 'full' time Shadchanim, most suggestions come from anywhere including friends and family.

It is sweet and insightful and funny. Two American women from different religious cultures become friends through their work in the classroom, then more deeply bound because they are separately enduring the pressures that family and religious culture bring to bear via the institution of arranged marriage. Their closeness evolves in a way that is altogether natural and human.

It's a wonderful distinctively American movie. Though the two young women come from different religious cultures, they have enough in common to forge a close friendship. There used to be a time when differences in inherited culture or religion and a good many other things didn't matter so much in this country--I grew up in that time, a descendant of some of the first people off the boat from England, and I've been fairly appalled at all the divisiveness that has arisen over things that don't matter for squat in the larger scheme of things.

The other teachers are shown as flaunting their sexuality (which was slightly offensive to me...in that I hope that anyone watching understands that not every non-Jewish or non-Muslim is like that.)

I don't want to know everything that happens in the movie before I watch it.

I do often read them afterward, however.
I noted that many of the negative reviews tended to pick apart details, feeling the movie was prejudice against this religion or that, or didn't go
into enough detail about one aspect or another.
This is not a college course on religions. I feel it's a very poignant movie, that packs a lot in only 1 1/2 hours.

It portrays two women, each trying to find a balance between their upbringings in strong, yet completely different religious faiths, with each faith conflicting with an American society, as well.

It's upbeat & charming in many ways (yes, more of a chick flick), yet thought provoking, as well.
Yes, it could have gone into much more depth into both the issues & the characters, but then it would have been a completely different film, & probably much 'darker'. That's not what I was looking for, but I enjoyed the fact this movie just cracked open a door enough to provoke some thought.

3296492,1,B00116VG3M,"This movie could have been so much more.  It had the opportunity to really explore some similarities between religions but it fell short and relied on stereotypes and silly situations.  Both young women are lovely-looking and are presented with absolute duds for suitors but as soon as a good-looking young man shows up, they fall head-over-heels in love, give up their careers and become contented mothers.  How easy it is to make a good match!  This doesn't reflect the reality of anyone I know who has been in this situation.  I'm sure many arranged marriages work because of common beliefs, community and goals but I also know many that have failed.  The school principal in the film was totally unbelievable but she actually said a few things that made sense.  it's pretty hard to imagine an educated woman who interacts with the modern world being content to be a wife and mother only.",1437523200,2,891,4.784313725490196

Both young women find themselves teaching at the same public school, and being at the age when their parents are attempting to arrange marriages for them.  Of course, when one first reads the movie's description, it's easy to immediately assume both of these women are against arranged marriages, and are going to be battling their parents from start to finish.  But that's not what the movie is about.  Both Rochel and Nasira believe in arranged marriages.  However, they also want to be the ones to choose who they marry from the possible interviewees.

Rochel has the most turbulent time of it due to the combined involvement of her impatient mother, an aunt and a matchmaker.  Not only is this where most of the serious drama in the movie can be found, it's also where most of the humor can be found.  It is truly a delightful, intelligent and thought-provoking movie. I can't say enough nice things about it.  My only complaint is about the picture they chose to use on the DVD box, showing Nasira and Rochel sitting on a park bench.  This picture is from the final scene in the movie, and those who knows about Orthodox Judaism will realize from the picture how the movie turns out, at least for Rochel. They should have used a picture from a scene much earlier in the movie. Also, don't watch any trailers if you have not seen the movie.

3296602,4,B00116VG3M,"I loved this movie. It was an entertaining story of two very different women who are thrown together at work and then become friends and realize that they have a lot in common. As both women are about to be married by arrangement, they share their fears and frustrations and help each other, which was very sweet. It was especially touching the way that Nisera went out of her way to help Rochel to get introduced to Gideon, and she took no credit for it, she just did it anonymously.

I think that the movie should have explained a few things about each religion, instead of assuming that the viewer knows.

For example, why is it that Orthodox Jewish women cannot shake hands? Why do they wear wigs or scarves on their heads? Why couldn't Rochel's younger sister be included in the marriage meetings? Why was the little brother Avi so rudely excluded (""Hush"") so that he couldn't even ask a simple question? It was clear that Rochel's hair was untouched until she was married, and then she wore a scarf like the other married women. It could have been explained why Muslim women cover their heads but men do not. The ""voodoo"" scene with the red string around Rochel's wrist left me clueless. I am sure that many viewers did not understand the hand-painting. I would have enjoyed some explanation about the two religions and their marriage practices. When the principal was so rude and inappropriate toward Nisera and Rochel (many times), the movie could have used those opportunities for Nisera and Rochel to explain some things. At the end of a movie, I shouldn't feel a need to look things up to find answers myself, the movie should have explained more.

The two weddings at the end were just quick glimpses. I would have appreciated a little more of the two weddings, at the very least a good look at the two wedding dresses.

The very last scene was sweet, where Rochel and Nisera are sitting in the park with their baby carriages. I also wished that that scene was longer, with some details discussed about their weddings and married life.",1421280000,,2047,4.630853994490358

3296633,4,B00116VG3M,"I'm probably not going to say anything new (there are some great reviews here already) so I'll be brief: I liked this movie, but I had to turn off my critical thinking skills to enjoy it.

To elaborate: From a religious point of view, I found the discussion of WHY the girls observed certain customs entirely lacking. It's as if they had absolutely zero curiosity about each other, which, in my experience, is typically not the case when cultures collide. This is sad, because frankly, both Orthodox Jews and Muslims have some interesting things to say on the matter.

From a feminist point of view, this piece was predictably disappointing. Their whole journey seems to be about meeting gender expectations. Not once did either one mention or demonstrate a desire to have kids--and yet we move from meeting the man of our dreams to, in the very next scene, rocking babies in the park and making predictable, stereotypical jokes about their husbands. There isn't one scene about enjoying married life.

From a teacher's point of view, the principal--who obviously represented ""lapsed"" Jews--was ridiculous. Her comments to the two religiously observant leads does not demonstrate any level of education--nor political awareness! No principal would be stupid enough to put herself in danger of a lawsuit like that. Moreover, most non-observant people I know are incredibly intelligent, yet she was made out to be a foolish caricature of people who aren't as observant (read: good) as the leads.

The odd thing is that I enjoyed this film, the way I enjoy cheesy, predictable shows like Seventh Heaven or really any film from the 90s. It's comforting, and the two lead actresses were adorable. It was a cute friendship and ultimately, a cute film.",1412985600,2,1745,4.986254295532646

3296655,5,B00116VG3M,"""Arranged"" (2007 release; 89 min.) brings the story of two women, both of them new teachers at a local public school in Brooklyn. We first get to know Nasira, born in Syria and a practicing Muslim. We then also get to know Rochel (a/k/a Rachel), a Jewish-Orthodox woman born and raised in New York. They have their challenges with their 4th grade class, and perhaps because of it, develop a strong bond. Meanwhile at home, Rachel's parents are trying to find the perfect partner with the assistance of a matchmaker (""yentl""). In Nasira's world, it is her father who is doing the matchmaking. Will the women's friendship be acceptable to their respective families? Will they find ""the perfect partner""? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, the movie is beautifully co-written and co-directed by Diane Crespo and Stefan Schaefer. The movie feels very authentic, and at no time did I feel that the directors went out of bounds or purposefully played havoc with our emotions. Second, the movie is a brilliant display of what it means to be tolerant and open to the ideas of believers of a different world and religion. But even more than that, the movie also showcases the emotional toll that can be caused by these ""marriage arrangers"", be they the yentl or the father, while at the same time also making clear that these ""marriage arrangers""  truly have the best interests at heart of the young women, even if it isn't always obvious. Third, the two lead actresses are top notch. Zoe Lister Jones shines as Rachel (I remember her from seeing in ""Lola Versus"" a few years ago), and Francis Benhamou is just as good as Nasira. The chemistry between these two is palpable. I hated to say goodbye to these characters at the end of the movie. This movie should be required viewing for all high school kids in America.

This was released in 2008 on DVD by Film Movement as part of their growing library of foreign and indie movies, and as usual the DVD contains a bonus shortie.

3296702,4,B00116VG3M,"Good films aid and assist moral growth and individuation, and this beautifully done movie definitely qualifies as ""good film.""  The fact that it is a small-budget independent film shot in less than 20 days puts into shameful perspective how much time, money and human potential is wasted on idiotic big budget action films which rake in money but ultimately have (at best) no positive personal impact.  Yes we watch movies to be entertained, but good film edifies at the same time that it entertains.

That said, I didn't give the movie five stars because the ending strikes me as contrived.  First, it strikes me as highly improbable that the Jewish matchmaker would so readily accept matchmaking information for Rochel from a stranger (Rochel's Muslim friend pretending to be Jewish).  I guess it COULD happen, but -- again -- that plot turn greatly reduced the story's believability and began to make it seem more 'Hollywood fantasy"" than ""independent realism.""

Second, I was frustrated by the ending:  have they totally given up on their desires to teach school?  Are two such competent and strong women really content just to sit at the park with matching baby buggies and chit chat?  And I really didn't like Rochel's comment that as mothers they are going to have their families wrapped around their little fingers (or something like that) to signify that they are now changing into women just like their mothers.  I have always hated the stereotypical assumption that people 'inevitably' grow up to be just like their parents when they are adults -- that is SO untrue!  I am nothing like either of my parents, and no one who is truly an individual is going to end up living out a cultural stereotype.  I feel like the filmmakers sold out two well-crafted and believable characters by a formulaic, agenda-laden ending (IMHO).

Third, like Tom Hanks' character in the movie Big when he attends the Empire-State-Building-Turning-Into-A-Robot toy presentation, I have to admit that with respect to the Unity Circle activity:  ""I don't get it.""  Rochel uses the activity to teach 4th graders that people choose their own friends based upon individual characteristics -- and I guess that is her point -- but she also seems to teach that you can be accepted by almost anyone if you simply change (or repress) something vital about yourself (i.e., the child who self-identified as 'nasty' will likely be accepted back into the circle if he simply chooses a nicer characteristic with which to self-identify) . . . and, so, at the risk of looking stupid, ""I don't get it.""

I don't see how the Unity Circle adds anything to the class' understanding of religious tension between Muslims and Jews, when Nijera had already given an excellent explanation in class:  that there are millions of Muslims around the world of different nationalities, languages and beliefs, and that hatred is born of ignorance between people who do not try to understand one another.  She makes it clear (by implication) that she and Rochel are not the type of people to fall into the stereotype of Muslim-Jew mutual hatred -- and, again, I don't see where the Unity Circle added to that AT ALL.  Yet the film gives the impression that the Unity Circle activity was inspired, enlightened and explained why Rochel and Nijera are friends despite religious differences.

Those things said, there are many things I love about this movie.  For example, I agree with other reviewers who applaud this film for the very well done party scene:  Rochel has no interest whatsoever in engaging in immoral activities which violate her religious beliefs, and THIS I found to be realistic.  People with loose moral standards rationalize their behavior by telling themselves that ""everyone"" is tempted by immorality and that those who live a moral life only do so because they repress base (natural) desires through rigid self-discipline.  WRONG.

I also love the positive portrayal of arranged marriage because even though I am glad I had the freedom to choose my own spouse(s), I think a good marriage results more from the moral and loving attitudes and actions exhibited within the marriage itself than from any factors existing at the time two people meet and agree to marry.  Thus, two people who have a lot in common and good chemistry can end up in a horrible marriage if one or both of them choose during the marriage to adopt attitudes/actions/desires inconsistent with a good marital relationship -- and two strangers who start out with almost nothing in common can, over time, build a strong, loving relationship if they are both committed to doing so.

As a young girl I thought arranged marriage was right up there with foot-binding with respect to ""cruel human practices,"" but God challenged that idea by leading me to read Marjorie Holmes' beautiful novel 'Two from Galilee.'  Two from Galilee is the imagined love story of Mary and Joseph (parents of Jesus), but what struck me most was how Holmes imagined the love story between Mary's parents, who were strangers before being bound together by their parents via an arranged marriage.  I don't want to give any further spoilers, so please read this wonderful book for yourself -- especially if you profess Christianity.  It is a sign of the lost state of the organized church that Two from Galilee isn't even sold in Christian bookstores any more -- but I know you can buy it off Amazon.

One last note:  I watched this film with preteen boys and it was a wonderful catalyst for indepth conversation about many important cultural, religious and interpersonal topics.  Add this one to your family's movie viewing list.",1396656000,,5643,4.925026399155227
3296703,2,B00116VG3M,"Two women from 2 entirely different backgrounds. One is Jewish, and the other Muslim. The similarities between the two are surrounded on the fact that they are old fashioned, and hold on to an era gratefully forgotten. Both women of dating age must date, and marry the man that is chosen for them. Whether it is by Matchmaker, or Daddy dearest. They are both teachers, they both dress to religious specifications. They both get involved in the matchmaking process to assure their friend is not marrying a dog. ""Woof"" They both can not stand the person that is arranged for them to marry.

In spite of a long drawn out, bore fest. It fails in the script, however the acting is the only positive thing I can say about this yawn. If your into female movies with little to NO substance this is for you.

Taking place in New York young Jewish Rokala ""Rachel"" comes of age to marry. No sooner then her finishing school does her parents start throwing her in the dating pool. Calling all creeps, calling all creeps fresh meat here! The matchmaker, and her parents waste little time with a bunch of eligible bachelors. Geriatrics, Rude, pushy schmucks who don't ever stop flushing their toilet of a mouth. Men who's only hope for marriage outside of mail order brides, is the old fashioned custom of parents giving away their children for marriage to the guy with the most money, and success. Tell young Rachel that you don't have to look at him to procreate.

Her friend a lovely young woman whose name I did not care enough to remember. She is having similar problems with her family, minus a pushy matchmaker. Her dad sets her up with a plethora of men old enough to be her uncle, that want to pounce on top of her. She befriends Rachel, and both teach at the same school.

""Skip to scene"" where there Boss / principal get involved telling them to put on makeup, and offering a donation towards a new wardrobe for both of them. Instead of standing up for their rights, they bite their lip, smile, and decline the generous offer. The Principal gets involved a couple more times, and then finally Rachel tells her off.

They bring each other home to each respected families. ""Hi Mom, look what's coming to dinner."" The families act as you can expect, all uptight, and quiet. You can always tell a bigot, watch the body language, how they eye you for being different. Funny every ethnic race plays the race card. Kudos to the talentless list of C Grade actors making this a gem for the ages.

The fun starts when they both see an attractive guy for the other, who happens to be the right religion, and begin playing matchmaker.  Stereotype much director. Because there is a huge line between reality and fiction we get a happy ending.
They both squeeze out a few puppies, and have a picnic in central park.",1395619200,,2798,4.550695825049702

That said, I will admit that I'm mindful that I do wonder if it's an entirely realistic portrayal of arranged marriages. In both instances, parents were willing to accept that each of the female leads rejected potential suitors (albeit begrudgingly in the case of the Jewish woman). Spoiler alert:  In the end handsome, well-educated and perfect husbands arrived. As a film it's a complete and satisfying viewing experience. Not a criticism necessarily, but not being privy to the practice of contemporary arranged marriages I wonder if this is typical.

There's one complaint made by a few reviewers that bothered me too at first, but now that I've thought about it I think it makes sense. Namely, it is true that the Muslim family in this film is portrayed far more sympathetically and less stereotypically than the Jewish family. However, I think this is because of the structure of the film, which is somewhat incorrectly advertised as a movie about the two girls. It's really a movie about Rochel, with Nasira as the primary supporting character. That's why Rochel is the one who is doubtful and considers rebellion; that's why she is shown going on half a dozen horrible dates (exaggerated for humor, rather effectively) while Nasira is shown on just one, enough to show what she and Rochel have in common; that's why Rochel starts out as the demure girl whose character develops over the course of the film, while Nasira is self-confident and assertive from the start; and that's why Rochel's mother is so horrible to her (because, drama!) while Nasira's family is loving and supportive and would never dream of pushing her into anything she doesn't want. I did think it was a little ridiculous that Rochel's family was so mean to Nasira while Nasira's family was all just, ""Oh, cool, an Orthodox Jewish girl hanging out in our home,"" but again, I think that's because part of Nasira's role in the film is to be a girl from another equally strict religion who is perfectly happy with everything about it. This leads right into the ending, which is like everything else in the film - not overly dramatic or sensational, but extremely well-acted and a lot of fun to watch.",1358035200,4,1827,4.673913043478261

Sometimes I think us ""Western's"" have such a negative way of thinking regarding arrange marriages or having a matchmaker.  In any marriage you can have the potential of a jerk or a VERY unkind partner.  Whether you are picking out whom ever you think your partner should be, or you have some help.  However, too many times arranged marriages are looked upon by others who do not do this, as always being such a bad thing.  And I thought this movie was a great way to see the other side, that it is not always a bad thing.  And it was great that these families, lived in the USA.  Plus them being from different religions, made it nice to also bring up two types of religion that ""hate"" each other.  Yet show how in the end, we all are not so different.

That woman played her role very well---she really was obnoxious and annoying!  LOL!  Anyway, the reason for my review is to say that since everyone was basically dressed modestly in this movie (with a few minor character's being ""worldly"" that is) except for the one scene where Rochel leaves her parents' house and goes to see a ""renegade"" family member who no longer is with the Orthodox faith... Though it was nice Rochel had someone to talk to, the scene then has her going to a party with her relative and what ensues is your typical bumping and grinding to music and drinking and when Rochel tries to flee from a guy who is being a jerk, she opens one door to a group of people who are obviously doing drugs and offer her some.  Then she opens another door to bump into people vigorously making out.  The good thing about this is that if your DVD player has it so you can ""skip"" chapters or scenes, you can skip this scene as soon as Rochel leaves her parents' house, and the next scene is Rochel and Nisira talking at school.  It is very hard these days to find a movie of this caliber without something smutty in it, so just skip this scene and you will enjoy the movie more.

The high level of anxiety over the tradition of arranged marriages is evident and becomes a point of mutual frustration.  This challenge, together with the open-mindedness of these women, results in a lasting friendship.

I found this independent film to be an extremely refreshing break from the typical Hollywood blockbuster fare that is spun out over and over again.

3296868,5,B00116VG3M,"Loved this little filme by director Diane Cresco about a friendship between two deeply religious female teachers - one Jewish and one Muslim, but both agreeing to arranged marriages.  Although everyone around them [the principal of the school, students, their families] views their relationship as somewhat unsettling or unnatural, the women prevail in their close connection.  It is a sweet film proving that shared experience is what truly matters, not labels and politics.  As the women go on their quest for a family-approved husband we see them go on some hilarious dates and meet several amusingly awful prospects and sometimes get frustrated and hopeless - turning to brief scenes of rebellion before ultimately choosing to stay true to their tradition.

Zoe Lister-Jones and Francis Benhamou are perfectly cast, no action seems like a stretch, they fit into their respective characters with grace and ease.  Moreover, the women are strong lead characters - much unlike women's roles in romantic comedies where all they do is whatever their man wants (or whatever will get them a man).  Rochel and Nasira choose their own fates, despite having them arranged.  They make the decision to follow the tradition of arranged marriages and then they go on to decide who they will marry.  Arranged in a wonderful showcase of friendship and love without boundaries or prejudice.  I highly recommend it.",1307923200,3,1400,5.1866666666666665
3296869,4,B00116VG3M,"I enjoyed this film and did not get bored watching it. I agree with most of the comments reviewers have made, including some somewhat contradictory ones.

The movie is well done but there are some awkward parts. It is definitely simplistic, does include stereotypes, and I did feel it presented the Jewish family in a less favorable light than the Muslim family. Anti-Semitism? Political agenda? Not in my opinion. Equality or acceptance does not mean everything has to be doled out in exactly equal portions. It's OK for a Jewish family to be shown to have more negatives than a Muslim family. That does not translate into ""all Jewish families are more controlling and less accepting than all Muslim families.""

As far as the lead characters making a ""choice"", well it's a limited choice. Nasira is never shown to question her beliefs or practices. Yes she gets annoyed at being asked to seriously consider one very unsuitable mate but that's about it.

When Rochel becomes distressed over her options, she goes to visit a cousin who lives a secular lifestyle and they go to a party where of course Rochel is extremely uncomfortable. Rochel's ""choice"" is made to seem very black and white--stay with what you know and accept a mate you may not want, or escape into the world, drink, do drugs, have wanton sex, and never see your family again. Those viewers unfamiliar with the culture may not understand that anyone who leaves their home and beliefs is declared dead, actually mourned the same as if they had died, and no one in their family will ever talk to them again. So ""choice"" is not exactly what you may be thinking. Most young people need a lot of help from family to get started in life and to do without that help and support can be an insurmountable obstacle.

I think ""choosing"" to be religiously observant is way overplayed. For most children in deeply religious families, leaving is unimaginable and would be incredibly isolating, and the option of staying but not following observant ways just doesn't exist. Could Rochel had stayed in her family and religion and just ""chosen"" to not get married or to date and pick out her own spouse? I don't think so. Could Nasira likewise have just decided to go out into the world dressing in a secular fashion while still living at home? Don't think so.

Well that's my soapbox. But that's why it's a good movie. It gets you thinking and talking about such ideas.

The part about the Unity circle was just awful. It seemed the worst possible way to try to teach inclusion--give people simplistic labels and choose to exclude or accept them based on the labels. Whatever message the movie was trying to convey was unclear to me--the awkwardness and inexperience of new teachers perhaps?

Another enjoyable movie that touches on these topics--solely from a Muslim point of view--is Sabah. It has its faults too, but includes some drama, some romance, and also humor. The scene where a girl is being pressured to meet a prospective mate is hilarious and how it plays out was very well done. Sabah shows more of a middle ground of staying in the family but the family evolving to accept some change.",1306713600,5,3152,4.730418943533698

3296872,5,B00116VG3M,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It is another fine example of the possibility of quality film being made without a big Hollywood budget, and without super-star celebrity participation. The principals are believable and engaging in their roles. At one point I took note of the fact that I was lost in the story the film was telling, despite the lack of a manipulative, big-budget musical score.

The two main characters, Rochel, an Orthodox Jew, and Nasira, a devout Muslim, find that they share more in common with each other, despite their religious differences, than they do with the culture around them. While this film is certainly about the possibility of cross-cultural friendship between those at the extremes of different faiths, I found that it spoke to me more as an exploration of the possibility of faithful adherence to traditional values of any stripe in the face of modern pressures to acquiesce to the prevailing secular culture. The central struggle concerns the tradition of arranged marriage, a tradition that puts those who practice it squarely at odds with a modern society convinced there is only one way to find a mate. I felt these strong, young women's honest struggle as they tried to reckon with the pressures of the traditional faiths of their families, society, and their own personal autonomy.

What I especially appreciated about the film is that the two young women were smart, beautiful, and fully cognizant of their ability to chose a life for themselves. They realized that their adherence to the traditions of their faith was a conscious choice and a legitimate, though not always easy, one.",1299974400,23,1627,5.022222222222222

3296874,4,B00116VG3M,"A Syrian Muslim woman and an Orthodox Jewish woman begin teaching in the same school. As the title suggests, both of their families are in the process of finding the perfect husbands for them, and sharing stories of what they're going through with each other helps them bond. It's a sweet story that shows that while not all Jews and Muslims get along, there are many peaceful Jews and Muslims that are great friends.

The film isn't full of dramatic actions or insane plot twists, so if you're looking for that in this movie, look elsewhere. However, for an independent film, it is pretty charming. It is a simple and straightforward movie. The tribulations these young women go through, especially the Orthodox Jewish woman, are pretty funny. The women's friendship also helps them cope with the school principal, who ironically bullies them to be more liberal.

Oh, and it's also nice that this movie presents what an ""arranged"" marriage should be. Both women are presented with many choices for potential husbands; however, ultimately, they CHOOSE whom they want to marry, as in any other marriage. Arranged marriages should never be forced or pressured. On the other hand, one shouldn't criticize arranged marriages as long as the people who are in them are okay with them. It's not the ideal way to marry for everyone, but these families are generally fine with it, so let them be.",1293926400,8,1387,4.872881355932203

3296907,5,B00116VG3M,"The Orthodox Jewish woman Rochel and the Muslim woman Nasira each experience arranged marriages. However, this is perhaps more matchmaking than arranged marriages per se. The women are, to a degree, allowed to veto their parents' choices.

The two women are teachers. Jewish-Muslim prejudices show up even in the children. One Jewish boy thinks that the Muslims want to push Israel into the sea. Nasira, their teacher, points out that there are 1.5 billion Muslims of many different languages and cultures. No single Muslim can speak for all Muslims.

Rochel gets into conflicts with her parents because she has no feelings for any of the men that her parents have put forth. At one point, she leaves home for an evening to go to a contemporary party. However, the modern life is not for her. In fact, both Rochel and Nasira have a self-righteous feminist principal who looks down on them, accusing them of leading an outdated, repressed life, and telling them that women have been liberated. At one point, Rochel fires back: ""How is sleeping with a guy you don't even know liberated?"".

In time, Rochel glances at an Orthodox Jewish guy sitting in a library. It is love at first sight. But how can the parents arrange this marriage? Nasira pulls off a series of little tricks, and then...",1290902400,5,1289,4.823529411764706

3296909,1,B00116VG3M,"I had to watch this film a second and third time, just to make sure my perceptions were accurate.  I found this film to be highly biased in its comparison of the two relgions/cultures, and their rituals, names, dating processes.  When the Muslim man is washing his hands in preparation for prayer, this ritual is sensitively depicted. When the Muslim girl and her intended are sitting on the couch meeting her parents for the first time and deciding to go ahead with the match, they are portrayed as high-achieving and beautiful with a promising future ahead. I saw nothing in the film portraying Jewish culture in a sensitive way; quite the opposite.  The women (Rochel's mother and the shadchan, and Rochel herself) were portrayed as catty, sniping, loud-mouthed. The list goes on.  Jewish environs, rituals, people, attitudes, names all were portrayed as ugly and nebby, while Muslim ones were shown as sensitive, beautiful, and rich with pride in heritage.

3296910,3,B00116VG3M,"I suspect other reviewers who have had only good things to say about this film are commenting only on its social message and not its value as a film, ie entertainment.

As a social message, it's a decent one:  Jews and Muslims can and do get along, and we have many commonalities.

I don't feel the Jewish community is well-portrayed at all, however, nor, perhaps the Muslim one, though I'm not familiar enough with Muslim families to say so definitively.  On the Jewish side, every ""character"" around the two women is a functional stereotype, intended to represent attitudes in their communities:  the religious Jewish mother, the yeshiva-boy brother suspicious of all ""goyim,"" the anti-religious Jewish principal.

These ""characters,"" though occasionally well-acted, are essentially cardboard cut-outs standing in for real, three-dimensional human beings, whose lives and actions are rarely so simple and direct.

The two lead actors are charming and well-casted and carry the film to its ultimately predictable conclusion despite these awkwardnesses.  But even their charm cannot mask what is a weird, stilted, and agenda-driven movie that falls far short of the gold standard of enjoyability.  The result is a ""light"" issues film that ultimately fails to make its mark.",1280707200,16,1273,5.325
3296911,5,B00116VG3M,"In all honesty, I've seen only two movies this year that I found worth watching.  The first, Quentin Tarratino's ""Inglorious Bastards"" (absolutely riveting), and the second, ""Arranged"".  Both films are as different from one another as night and day.

""Arranged"" is a sweet, well-acted film about the relationship between two female teachers, one Jewish and one Muslim. Both women are raised in households with strong belief systems handed down to them by their families, and both women broke the cultural vice of presumed conflict and mistrust.  What I enjoyed about this film is that it was never over the top, and showed family life in these families in an honest and open way.  What made a mark on me also was the strong contrast in being raised within a family structure such as the Jewish and Muslim cultures, then being thrown into the unprotected, confusing contemporary world of sex, drugs and alcohol. Thought provoking.",1277424000,,929,5.0064935064935066
3296912,4,B00116VG3M,"This movie is essentially a chick flick with an added theme.  It involves two young female school teachers, an Orthodox Jew and a Syrian Muslim, who find that their conservative views significantly alienate them from the surrounding secular society.  Because of this similarity, they form a bond, despite the obvious religious tension.  The movie is a chick flick because the plot revolves around their parents trying to arrange marriages for them, a process that doesn't always go smoothly but concludes with a happy ending for both of them.

The added theme, of course, is the religious element.  The movie doesn't really go into the issues involved in the Jew/Muslim conflict, but the implied suggestion is that there may be enough common ground to overcome differences and history.  I don't know how realistic that message is, but I like the idea of promoting tolerance.  Another interesting and unexpected aspect is that the Muslim family comes across as more liberal and tolerant than the Jewish family.  Again, I don't know if this is realistic, but it's nice to see a portrayal of Muslims which challenges the ultra-conservative stereotype.

In the end, this isn't an overly deep or complex movie, but I like its positive and hopeful messages, and the acting is solid, so I recommend it -- and not just to chicks.",1274054400,13,1321,4.968181818181818
3296913,2,B00116VG3M,"As a way of introduction, I'd like to say that I have been a customer of amazon's for about 11 years and my decision to buy a movie, CD or book is often based on customer reviews. However in all those years I had restrained myself from leaving reviews of my own. I could go into a great deal of  dicussion as to why not, but that's not what this is about. The question I suppose is; why now?.
Well, about 20 minutes into this movie, I realised I couldn't let my son watch it. If rated, the movie would be appropriate for a general audience. It would seem that innocuous, except for the scene about the ""unity circle"". It makes no sense to me whatsoever that the character of Justin, a 9 year-oldish African-American boy who, up until the time of the enactment of the unity circle, had contributed to the introduction of the central theme of the ""strangeness"" of the friendship between a Jewish teacher and her Moslem colleague, should nonetheless be made to play the part of one who 'made the choice' to exclude himself from the circle.
Given the task of choosing just one word that describes him or her, of the children in the classroom, Justin it was that came up with the word 'nasty' to describe himself. As if this wasn't bad enough, there was not an attempt to explore with the child, why he would choose this word to describe himself. Instead there followed a vote to decide whether he should stay in the circle or not based on differing opinions about whether someone nasty should be part of the group - never mind the fact that he had not actually behaved in a way that would warrant a consideration of acceptance or exclusion. If Justin decided he would choose another word other than nasty he could re-enter the group. Subsequently there followed a brief didactic to the children on how we ""choose"" to be part of one group or not ... . The explanation was even more confusing than the procedure that came before.
At the beginning of the movie, the Jewish teacher's much younger brother had made a derogatory remark about 'blacks' that his father had chastised him about. ""We don't use those words in this family"".
One may have wondered what the significance of ""blacks"" is, in the very specific narrow context of the movie - the friendship between a Jewish woman and a Moslem woman. Perhaps the writers were trying to make the case for the idea that prejudice against blacks in this society is of there own doing. They make that choice. Unfortunately the manner in which it was conveyed only serves to perpetuate the negative view of the black male (in particular) in this culture. Justin is given the role of expressing a low regard of himself (as is perhaps the prescribed lot of the black child in America,) and yet up until the contentious scene, he had displayed a healthy curiosity about the friendship between the two women that ought to have been instructive in his own life, if the question was addressed with a more common sense response.",1272844800,11,2959,4.551594746716698

3296936,4,B00116VG3M,"This is a very well done small-budget film about relationships between religions.  It emphasizes the things the two have in common more than the differences.

Schools might find it a useful film to use to explain cultural differences and similarities as it tells the story of two young women teachers, one Jewish Orthodox and one Muslim.  The two young women find their differences are minor and their similar conservative attitudes make them bind together to deal with their own lives and their jobs helping their students learn.  Both are being helped by their families in a search for the right husband and both have similar problems with choosing.  Inter-cultural relationships among the men in their lives are also shown in passing as the brother of the Muslim girl is in a study-group at his university with a young Jewish Orthodox man.

3296938,5,B00116VG3M,"An understated yet wonderful gem -- all the more impressive in light of its having been filmed in a mere 17 days!

This story -- of a warm friendship that develops between two women of very different religions yet not-so-different hearts and circumstances -- avoids so many wrong paths that lesser films might have (and all too often have indeed) taken. On the one hand, it does not romanticize sincere devotion as an always clear or comfortable path; and it vividly portrays both the humour and the frustration a younger generation may experience in receiving guidance from its elders. On the other hand, it does not condemn or even trivialize 'conservative' adherence to such beliefs and traditions.

I especially appreciated one episode involving a party, in which a young woman's reaction, to things so many today would consider normal social activity, is depicted neither as self-righteousness nor as weakness nor even as temptation-barely-avoided. She simply does not find that world attractive.  Indeed, far more of us understand her aversion than most of the entertainment industry usually recognizes. And when, later, she does pointedly 'take a stand', it is against someone whose pride in being more 'worldly' and 'sophisticated' was what had proved the REAL self-righteousness.

Ultimately, however, this is a story of affirmation, and a film both charming and fun.  The two central roles are played out perfectly -- blending humour, angst, intelligence, and 'spunk' in a way that is utterly believable.  These are women you would want to know, women who could become anything they choose ... and who succeed in doing so.",1255737600,8,1632,5.162878787878788

But the characters are one-dimensional.  My viewing partner said her impression was that there was no character growth and she was right.  I found it entertaining in a chick-flick kind of way.  The only truly misguided part was the role of the headmistress or principal, who I guess was supposed to embody all of liberal societal prejudice.  No educator in NYC would dare voice the types of complaints she does or be so insensitive.  I can't even think why she would want to - what does a principal get from forcing assimilation on a teacher?",1254614400,19,693,4.569105691056911
3296941,4,B00116VG3M,"This film was about 2 friends--one Jewish, one Muslim--who are going through the process of meeting men to marry in a semi-arranged marriage. It was an entertaining film, but things seem to get resolved too easily in the end. I was taken aback by the vicious guilt trip Rochel's (the Jewish girl) mother puts on her to get married through their system, immediately. Although the movie views this guilt trip through a comical lens, guilt tripping and trying to emotionally manipulate someone to that degree is really an abusive thing to do. I would have liked to have seen Rochel stand up to her mother more over this issue, but then of course her prince in shining armor enters the picture and rescues her.

Although the movie presents the arranged-marriage system in a positive light, you do get glimpses of the intense pressure put on members of these conservative religions to conform. If they don't it sounds like they are viewed as garbage. Eg, Rochel's mother implies that being unmarried past 23 (an old maid) is a tragic situation that's beyond the pale. And imagine if one of these girls got pregnant out of wedlock--it seems like the parents would most likely completely shun them, force them to abort, or maybe even kill the girl. The movie definitely makes me question how much parents in these cultures truly, unconditionally love their children (especially their female children).

Although the movie presents a light and lively view of these cultures, it made me think of the dark side for those who don't live up to the cultural expectations. I guess I would have liked a movie that went into that aspect a little more.",1246579200,6,1635,4.794326241134752

3296945,4,B00116VG3M,"""Arranged"" was as entertaining as it was moving.  Directors Stefan C. Schaefer & Diane Crespo keep the action focused and the story paced briskly.  Rochel is played by Zoe Lister-Jones who does an excellent job as a Jewish girl teaching in the public schools.  She helps a visually impaired student.  The uncertainty Lister-Jones shows as she sorts through a number of suitors including Daniel London's hilariously played nervous guy cameo as Elliot is entrancing to watch.  Finally, Rochel spots Gideon played mysteriously by Jason Liebman who catches her eye & then becomes the apple of her eye.

Nasira is played by Francis Benhamou who does an excellent job as the Islamic teacher at the same school where Rochel teaches.  As first teaching days sometimes go, one of the students demands to know if Nasira wants to kill Rochel because of their different faiths.  Benhamou does an excellent job showing a bit more assertive personality than Rochel and takes matters into her own hands to unite Rochel & Gabriel.  Nasira eventually is moved by Jamil played by Sanjit DeSilva as the two are united through the traditional channels.

Both the fathers are portrayed as loving and tender who truly care for their daughters.  This is one of the best aspects of the film.  John Rothman plays Matan who claims his blood pressure is going sky high because Rochel is not picking any of the husband candidates.  Laith Nakli plays Nasira's father Abdul-Halim likewise with a tenderness that makes us feel how strong the family bonds are.  Marcia Jean Kurtz also turns in a strong performance as Principal Jacoby who wants to get too involved in the lives of her teachers, but fails to respect the traditional cultures.

Give credit to the screenwriters for suggesting that their holding out for Mr. Right has a lot to do with the men who are their fathers - both of them caring and thoughtful providers for their families. Who wouldn't want a husband of that caliber?

I was charmed by this pleasantly (and finally) romantic comedy, which presents conservative religious and ethnic traditions in a way that does not condemn them. There are many secular viewers who, like the school principal, find arranged marriages oppressive and will continue to feel that way after seeing this movie.

3296984,4,B00116VG3M,"""Arranged"" is a delightful tale of a friendship that develops between a traditional Muslim, Nasira [Francis Benhamou] and an Orthodox Jew,Rochel [Zoe Lister Jones] who both teach at a Brooklyn school. A class session raises the question from one of the students :How can a Jew be friends with a Muslim? and this sets the stage for the two women to come together and eventually form a close friendship.

Both Nasira and Rochel are from very traditional backgrounds and though their faiths set them apart from each other, it is also the strictures required by those faiths that bring them together and help them commisserate with each other - they are both in the process of being matchmade by their respective families to 'suitable' young men from their own religious backgrounds. Nasira balks at one of the suitors her father brings forth and Rochel finds herself being put in awkward 'blind dates' by her well-meaning but clueless aunt.

Yes, there are some sappy bits in this movie, but the portrayal of tradition is very credibly done, and the strong acting by the two female leads elevates this movie from just another social commentary. Having come from a very traditional family myself, I can relate to the emotional conflicts these girls go through, and though I rejected the pressures placed upon me, I can also understand and respect why these two young women chose to keep to their traditions and appease their parents. It doesn't mean that they are weak, its ultimately their choice.

This is a subtle and well-directed movie that often elicited smiles and tears as I sat through it. Highly recommended!",1203465600,47,1614,4.904761904761905
3296985,4,B00116VG3M,"A wonderful social commentary film about two young women in Brooklyn.  One is Syrian Muslim, another one is Orthodox Jewish.  Both have been raised in New York in traditional families with similar values, regardless of their difference in religion. These women meet in elementary school where they are both teachers.  In the society where women walk around with open back tops and other revealing clothes, these two young women are very traditional in the way they dress, carry themselves and interact with the people around them.  It is their differnece that gives them appeal, beauty and admiration of their students and superiors. Both of them are also of age when they have finished their education, they are both working and it is their time to leave their family home and start their own families.  We learn about intricacies of arranged marriages on both communities and struggles that they have coming to terms that his is a life long decision they have to make not knowing if they will have regrets later on in their lives.  I found story and deep personal connection between these two women to be genuine and sincere.  One cannot stop thinking what happens to their generations of daughters 20 years from now.  This is a moving film, although acting was not as strong as one would have expected.  Another wonderful gem from the ""Film Movement"" company.",1203379200,3,1362,4.886956521739131
8240747,5,B00116VG3M,"Being someone from one of these faiths, i have to say, this process is quite as hilarious as it is in the movie. The demographics of work, community and family pressure deeply come into play so I see this movie being quite accurate. It's not ""stereotypical"", it's just truth to one part of the world, and that happens to be the U.S. from MY perspective. I really like this movie. I found it really funny and felt the frustrations as well. I liked how one girl tried to find herself in the process, and I wish more people took a step back like this to their parents (or community) who pressure them. I also liked the bits and pieces of culture shown in different aspects. Wished there was a part 2 to this..

One thing I will say is that it is a bit odd, some parents' reactions to other's visiting their homes (trying not to give away too much here). It would have been nice if some were more open minded.",1526688000,,905,4.261627906976744

8240752,5,B00116VG3M,"I stumbled upon this movie because of Zoe Lister Jones and because of the subject matter. By no means a complex movie, and let's not forget the the costar isn't Middle Eastern and isn't Muslim, Arranged does a great job of showing the similarities of these two Abrahamic Faiths. It also shows the prejudice of Americans about more traditional cultures. Excellent acting by Zoe.",1518220800,,377,4.90625
