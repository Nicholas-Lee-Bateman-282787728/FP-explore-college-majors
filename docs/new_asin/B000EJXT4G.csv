8110734,5,B000EJXT4G,"Wow..New Zealand is such a beautiful place..I have bought a few DVD's depicting a number of countries. This DVD has beautiful shots and is visually, a very good representation of everything New Zealand has to offer. The other 2 videos Bonus Videos on the DVD where ok, but the main 55 minute video entitled ""Kiwi Country New Zealand"" is spectacular. The bonus Maori Haka is OK along with the scenic slideshow. Modern video and well Narrated DVD. Recommended!!",1246147200,20,459,4.897435897435898
