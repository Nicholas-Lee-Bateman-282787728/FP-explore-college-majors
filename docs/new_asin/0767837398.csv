13869,5,0767837398,"One of my all-time favorites, but I find this movie is usually very personal. That is, some people respond to it very strongly where others just don't as much. The ending always leaves me with a bittersweet feeling of ""I've been there"". You know the main character will be alright, but something else was lost. it's one of those times you know you'll look back on fondly, but you knew it had to come to an end.
If you want the less sappy explanation -- it's a disillusionment archetype with an archplot structure. A character has certain ideals and those ideals change through his experience. We are carried through the story from his perspective and see why this happened. At the end, we are led to believe he is completely and irreversibly changed.

This movie isn't actually about punk. Punk is the vehicle they use to carry the plot. If someone were so inclined, they could change it to any ""extreme"" subculture and still have it be meaningful. It could be about people who are huge fans of black metal and still have the same basic story beats.

There's a saying where movies are made for the last 20 minutes, and I would say that is true about this one too. It has a really good ending that I like a lot. The beginning is plenty entertaining, but at times, can seem a little aimless or pointless. It is mostly just establishing atmosphere and backstory.

All in all, I would give this film an A-, really enjoyable.",1468800000,4,1420,4.517509727626459

Definitely a roller coaster of a ride.",1466035200,,329,4.274193548387097
13885,4,0767837398,"In a year of good movies (1999 was just fantastic for some reason), SLC Punk was easily missed by many. It has its share of problems, of course, and Matthew Lillard as an actor is extremely divisive. However, if you can approach it without hating it simply because of him, SLC Punk is an enjoyable coming of age film with a pretty great soundtrack. Also, look for an early performance by Jason Segel.",1465862400,,400,4.493150684931507

13939,4,0767837398,"4 Stars. James Merendino, who hasn't done anything notable but this movie, makes a charming story about the punk culture. In a total 90s filmmaking style, although taking place in the 80s, the movie moves forward and back in time to describe the quirky characters and were their lives will go. Much like Noah Baumbachs 1995 debut, Kicking and Screaming, the movie is about moving on. It retains the society philosophies that were seen in Kicking and Screaming but puts it to an angst and punk soundtrack, which the soundtrack to this movie is quite good. Matthew Lillard stars as Stevo, who alongside his pal, Bob, decide to spend their post college year pissing their lives away, only to realize that they and their friends must move forward with life and out of their unrealistic punk ideals.",1436400000,,794,4.802919708029197

14014,2,0767837398,"Rich snot has unbelievably understanding and cool parents that he pisses on and doesn't appreciate. Goes on about what it is to be punk. He's supposed to be some sort of genius but his idea of protesting ""The Man"" is wasting years of his life getting high and drunk in an abandoned building with his friend. Some of the story arcs are so stupid they can be passed off as comedy, such as the decently large part where they drive across state lines to buy stronger beer because Salt Lake City is a dry city that only sells low percent, riveting.

Poor representation of what punk culture is and what it was like during the 80's. The dialog isn't great, the characters are forgettable except for Heroin Bob, the narration done by the main character sounds like he's talking to a group of 8 year olds, it's historically inaccurate, the sound track is ok but is riddled with cliche bands and their most well known songs (nothing that isn't entry level), Tries to be intellectual but creates a flawed philosophy for the mentality that is punk. I know a lot of people who like this movie, but they are also people who aren't critical thinkers and don't really think for themselves. Watch Suburbia instead.",1406764800,,1198,4.598130841121495

14073,5,0767837398,"SLC Punk! is one of those movies I find myself reaching for quite often. It is a superbly entertaining coming-of-age tale with a rebellious twist. If humor and wit tickles your fancy, look no further.
 Matthew Lillard answered his ultimate calling playing the role of the main character Stevo. There could not have been a more perfect match for the spastic and rebellious persona. To make Stevo's story happen, independent director James Merendino summoned up an unbeatable cast of characters, including Final Destination's Devon Sawa, and Stevo's perfect match of a best friend, Heroin Bob, played by Michael Goorjian. I'm confused by other reviews I have read that say the acting is anything but terrific because I think the entire cast does an astounding job, especially in intense or funny situations, such as when a gun is pulled on Stevo and Bob, Sawa's character scaring a woman silly at a department store, and one of the final scenes of the movie that changes everything.
 The acting is complimented by an intelligent script that defines each character with a unique and well-developed personality, including Stevo's witty narrative throughout the film. There's never a cheesy line, only brilliance. All the fun is mixed with a soundtrack so fitting, it sounds as if it was written especially for the movie, and not years before.
 The issues in SLC Punk! are minor, including a few blurry camera shots. My main annoyance has to be when Stevo introduces or talks about a character all of a sudden in the middle of a scene, where it's apparent that, even though he just spoke to them, they no longer can hear or see him as he rambles on to the camera about them. It's awkward, and seems out of place when he was just right there with the person. Although, one does have to appreciate the extra information that may have been difficult to smoothly throw into a conversation between Stevo and the character.
 Overall, SLC Punk! is a rare movie worth a spot on every movie shelf. It will make you laugh, it will make you think, and it will completely surprise you.",1382486400,,2068,4.784313725490196

Story line: Adolescent does not want to ""part of the system"" becomes a punk with punk friends...his dad is a lawyer who thinks he should go to law school.

Adolescent fears being labeled a ""poser"" more than anything else, his group identity and his rejection of ""the system"" is his reason to live

Adolescent comes to realize he is wasting his life in Utah, the middle of nowhere, which is exactly what he accuses his dad and stepmom of. Adolescent has anger towards his parents for being dyfunctional and bad role models, but adolescent is learning his romantic relationships are failing too.

There is a bit of drama, but not so much that might tire most movie goers.

14130,4,0767837398,"Wow! I can't recall the last time I saw so many heated reviews.

I saw this movie awhile back so I'm a rusty review. Pardon me if I miss a few fine points but I can't watch it again. It's just too painful. When I saw it I saw my teenage life in a movie and wanted to just run out of the room. I didn't grow up in SLC but I did get transplanted from a large city into a small Midwest town with a fringe 'punk' scene during the second or third wave of punk. This movie is such a freaking history lesson because it describes a time when there was no Hot Topic (i.e. Punk was subculture and had no real money cashing in on it) and punk was a mostly unwanted subculture. If you looked like these kids during this time period you WERE the enemy, no matter how true your Anarchist morals might be. Just listening to the Dead Kennedy's in public was an act of Communism. See how I didn't say 'act of terrorism' there? Middle East terrorism was a thing of the late 70's so the hatred was against Communism. If you were anti-Reagan and said something as simple as 'what's so bad about collective farming?' in the mid 80's you were likely to evoke some hostility.

And so many look back at the time with the lens of the internet and Wikipedia misguiding their view. You must understand that if punk (a very small and unpopular music genre) came to your town it was through import. Either a friend from a big city brought it or some lone independent record store carried it along with a few odd albums from the 70's, like Zappa, that you'd never heard or cared about. And that was all you got. You couldn't hyperlink from Johnny Rotten to Anarchy and try to figure out what that rally meant. You just saw pictures of the Sex Pistols pissing everyone off and thought, 'yeah, that sounds about right'. Punk was your shield. You may not have understood all it's underlying philosophy (like there's actually one they can all agree to) but you understood the reaction, and that was enough.

Now here's the next kicker that strikes me as a little funny. It's odd that people can't fathom two people can experience the same phenomenon differently or have a different take on it. Being a punk in say NYC 77 would have been much different than being one in 86 insert small Midwest town, '81 Manchester England or '82 Los Angeles. This movie can't capture every 'punk' experience or perspective everyone had and it shouldn't. What it does well is describe the isolation, outcast and sometimes bizarre lifestyle proclaiming yourself a 'punk' might put you into. The scene with the drug dealer where he's shooting the car hoping to sink it in Great Salt Lake wasn't exactly my personal experience but it wasn't too far from the 'anything could happen so watch out' feeling I had when I proclaimed myself a 'punk'.

I knew someone like every single character in the movie during my 'punk' phase, and while I didn't become a lawyer I did look back on it all as an absurd but necessary coming of age transition set to a very angry soundtrack (my personal soundtrack had Husker Du's 'Zen Arcade', Black Flags 'Who's Got the 10 1/2' and DK's 'Fresh Fruit' playing most of the time). Again, ALL of this was too insane to live one time around and watch a second time around.

What really struck me as profound is Steve-O's girlfriend who points out how punk is just another uniform. Maybe the movement didn't start out that way but we all know that's all it became. It pains me to see what my friends and I used to call 'safety hawks' sported by people trying to look trendy just as much as it pains me to see motorcycle guys riding around wearing Harley gear. It's too cliche' to have any meaning or impact any more. When punk got corporate sponsorship a'la Hot Topic it said it's final death knell. It sounded kind of like this: ghhgghgghgghhh! Ghaaahhhh. Gehhhhehhgggh! (cough, cough, roll on the floor dramatically).

Was Steve-O a poseur? God, how we threw that term around way back when. Well, how punk is 'punk'? What is punk? Is it the crybaby Clash of 'Sandanista' bleeding a left-leaning heart out for some idiotic third world problem I have no clue about or is it the thrash of Greg Ginn's guitar solo against a sea of seemingly mediocre music? Do you have to run for office as a joke, like Biafra, and keep up this anti-right atitude for life no matter how annoying (again, Biafra), or do you have to keep your hate face on like Rollins? Or were you no longer punk if you weren't hanging with the CBGB crowd in the mid-70's? What if you weren't in a band? And what about those God-Awful skaters that would hang around like  flies on punk's rotten corpse, are they punk? Is it all about fighting authority? What if you become an authority on fighting authority?

Lux Interior (the Cramps) would tell Steve-O, and you for that matter, 'You ain't no punk, YOU PUNK!' After throwing away enough of my life to some silly movement that expressed my anger quite vividly I'd say Steve-O was  just as punk as anything else that came down the pike. I'm just glad he had the sense to move on and not let an art fad become his life. That's right hanger on-er's. Punk was just one big art fad. Time to let go and find something else or find nothing at all.

I think the director was trying to get away with implying that Heroin Bob's death was a natural result of the boys' crazy, chaotic lifestyle, but instead it was a mere happenstance the way Bob died:  it could have happened to anybody.

14148,3,0767837398,"""SLC Punk"" is a shallow good time disguised as a sociological study. While seeming to laude the tenets of both anarchy and punk rock, the film is profoundly conservative and insulting once you dig a little deeper beneath the surface. Lillard is great, even during the obnoxious ""speaking-directly-to-the-camera"" portions, but what stands out is an underlying contempt for both punk specifically, and rebellion generally. ""I didn't sell out, I bought in."" That perhaps best sums up the sensibility behind ""SLC Punk.""

14149,4,0767837398,"SLC Punk is about a couple of punk/anarchists stuck in the middle of conservative, Mormon-dominated Salt Lake City. This is a pretty good film, as long as one bears in mind that the kids in it represent more of a ""lifestyle anarchism"" than a political philosophy, and as Stevo (the main character and narrator) self-consciously admits at several points, their actions and attitudes often stand as a flagrant contradiction of the punk ethos they espouse. While the movie does not accurately portray the ""authentic"" punk or anarchist philosophy, it does accurately and poignantly portray a widespread, popular bastardization of it, so it still creates relevant social commentary. As a coming-of-age story, it is poignant and affecting, particularly as tragedy descends upon Heroin Bob, ironically named for his aversion to needles and drugs.

Throughout the movie is an undercurrent of dissonance between an anti-oppression philosophy and the characters' aimless,testosterone-fueled adventures. While Stevo and his friends rail against ""fascism,"" they glorify violence and act in ways that perpetuate the ""macho"" dominant culture. Fights are a way of life, and in one scene, Stevo (who claims earlier that ""nobody owns anybody"") catches the woman he likes with someone else and proceeds to beat the daylights out of the rival, who he accuses of ""invading his territory."" A less obvious irony is Stevo's...well...patriotism! He goes to great lengths to extol the superiority of America's punk scene, in one instance harassing a singer from the UK who's been roughed up by Stevo and other patriotic punks.

An excellent soundtrack adds another layer to the realism of the film.",1192924800,,1673,5.357414448669202

Many of these, like this one, were with my roommate in college, who was a certified movie freak. Although I forgot about it until I recently bought it for myself, one of the movies I liked a lot back circa 1999 was SLC Punk. As it rapidly segues from hilarious to touching, tragic to gross, ultimately SLC Punk shows it has a message beneath its surface noise, and it says a lot as it unfolds. At its center SLC Punk asks the question ""is buying-in always selling-out?"" To translate that for the uninitiated, that means is following cultural norms always a betrayal of personal identify and youthful dreams? Stevo and his best friend ""Heroin"" Bob (who ironically never touches drugs and is terrified of needles) are two young men living in uber-right wing Salt Lake City during the mid-Reagan years. They do their best to be hard core punks in a time and place where that pursuit separates them from just about everyone else in their Mormon dominated society. Steveo, though, is more than he seems. Amid his binge drinking, ambushing of local rednecks, and philosophical asides on the healthiness of personal anarchy, Steveo, it turns out, is a brilliant student who has the chance to get into an Ivy League college. His father, a smooth-talking Yuppie jerk, does his best to persuade his son to accept the Harvard education open to him, even as the life Steveo believes in proclaims that path to be the ultimate in ""selling out."" Along the way between its memorable opening scene and its closing credits viewers of SLC Punk meet a cast of characters that includes a rebel who disguises himself as a conforming prep, a trust-fund Eurotrash psychopath, a hippie Wiccan woman, and, well...one case of skin infection so bizarre it even stumps medical science. SLC Punk is worth seeing, owning, and heck, even spending ten minutes reviewing on Amazon.com. So go get it. Go get it now.",1172707200,,1969,4.7101449275362315

14177,4,0767837398,"A well-meaning if not slightly flawed film that is still highly recommended in the usually unwatchable wasteland that is the punk rock movie. The action centers around two lovably antagonistic protagonists, Stevo and Heroin Bob, as they try to verify personal truth in the unlivable (to them) wasteland of Salt Lake City in 1985. The fact that the pair are, at the time, the only ""real"" punks in the straight-laced Mormon metropolis allows the film to build upon a philosophical foundation of contrasts.

Within the madness and mayhem, certain scenarios allow larger issues to be argued; dualities discussed include punks vs. hippies, violence vs. peace, ""real"" punks vs. poseurs, chaos vs. structure, and anarchy vs. fascism. Some very good questions are both implicitly and explicitly asked, such as ""Does violent anarchism become fascism when it seeks to impose its value systems on others?""

And though most of these questions are answered with what amounts to a cinematic shrug, it is done in a knowing, wink-wink kind of fashion, as if the filmmakers are well aware that no solutions are being provided, and that it's only important that the viewer ponder the paradox. In other words: ""think for yourself.""

The only problem I had with the film is that it seems to, in places, equate punk with mindless violence, a cultural construct and media myth which has been in place since daytime talk shows reached out to the violently disenfranchised youth of America and said, ""Punks are messed up and need makeovers."" And the youth bought in.

And though I usually despise films that trumpet their soundtracks as a reason to see the film, in this movie the musical cues work really well, both in content and placement; not only are classic tracks by Exploited, the Stooges, Fear, the Ramones, the Vandals, the Velvet Underground, Adolescents, and Dead Kennedys featured, but oftentimes they are included at very appropriate points in the plot. The best example of this is when Minor Threat's ""Look Back and Laugh"" begins playing as Stevo contemplates his loyalty towards his best friend Bob. (For those of you not in the lyrical know, the words go, ""One day something funny happened, but it scared the s--- out of me/Their heads went in different directions, and their friendship ceased to be.""). But the real kicker is that the track is pushed back in the mix before the second part of the lyric kicks in, so in order for the musical cue to make any real sense, you have to know the song on your own. Nice.

Also rising above the mix are the performances by the lead actors, Matthew Lillard as Stevo and Michael Goorjian as Heroin Bob. Lillard transcends his usual one-note snarkiness to create an actual character, and Goorjian makes Heroin Bob (so named because of his fear of needles) one of the most likable - nay, lovable - characters in recent memory.

The commentary track on this DVD is somewhat entertaining but not particularly incisive - I was definitely expecting more insights from director/writer James Merendino, but he comes off somewhat disjointedly and nowhere near as thoughtful as the film he himself wrote and made.

What saves this particular commentary is the engaging verbal sparring of Matthew Lillard (who enters the commentary late 'cause he overslept - VERY PUNK) and Michael Goorjian (who has to leave early to catch a plane - NOT VERY PUNK). They spar with and complain to Merendino about the director's sometimes-unsafe, seat-of-the-pants filming technique, Lillard's mugging and each other's acting choices. That makes it worth a listen, but if you're looking for deeper insights into the film, you'll come away slightly disappointed.",1167436800,2,3667,4.991816693944354
14178,3,0767837398,"now don't get me wrong..i love punk music and the cultural and ideals are very eye opening and awe inspiring, and if i were to choose myself a stereotype, it would be punk, but this movie really does nothing for me. i mean especially after seeing classics like repo man and suburbia. i mean it just doesnt capture the same atmosphere as the punk films from the 80's. to me, matt lilliard looked more like an offspring poser over an 80's true punker. heroine bob was defiantely the best character in the film.

anyways, i find this film to be more of an emotional glance at the punk scene and growing up rather than a film about beating the system to a pulp and living for the moment.  like i would say it has very little attitude of punk as the movie titanic did with the actual history of the incident.  maybe it is just the utah scene though??

anyways, if you are into movies about friendships and growing up, this movie is a definite, but if you are more into attitude of punk check out suburbia and repo man. sadly to say, this is a movie for the hot topic generation.

Having to ""conform"" to the ways of our parents and other adult figures.

I think it was great how the movie showed that anarchy is yeah, cool in theory, but very unrealistic and impossible when a society needs to be able to work together to succeed.

I couldn't have been further from the truth, this place (as long as you stay close to downtown)is open-minded and hip.

But I remembered hearing about how Shawn Fightmaster ran with the acid in his pocket and tried to kill his mom. So I think that stuff was based on real events. I really enjoyed the scenes and got all nostalgic when I saw Positively 4th Street and the parks and streets of SL. I moved to Oregon since then. Bob seemed to be the most authentic portrayal of any punks I knew. Most of the punks I knew weren't very violent and they didn't run around yelling PUNK ROCK or ANARCHY! They were artists and musicians and they were far more interesting and individual than the films half baked portrayal. Especially Stevo.......poser. Mike was interesting and seemed like more of the people I knew......people who were just themselves and not trying to live up to any label. Real punks don't call themselves punk very often.......its just the way they are. The most interesting crowd were the ones you couldn't outwardly identify anyway. Too many labels in this film.

14212,5,0767837398,"I am not trying to insult anyone here, but I have read dozens of reviews of this excellent movie, and it seems a lot of folks miss the point.

This is a great movie, and I'll tell you why: it is a very very authentic insight, not into the punk scene in 1980s America (which there was one, but it wasn't very widespread or mainstream), but into adolescence and the transitions into maturity we all have to make.  It is a very good study on what happens to the identities we assume for ourselves as teenagers when we discover, in our early twenties, that they no longer fit.

If you haven't seen it yet, you may not want to read this review any further.

Stevo was a poser!  I can't say it any plainer than that.  He admits it too, so anyone who wastes the energy to type ""Stevo wasn't very convincing as a punk,"" or criticizes the punk scene as portrayed as not accurate, completely miss the point of this movie.  They weren't punks!  They were teenagers, trying to find an identity for themselves.  They knew what their parents and city were offering wasn't for them, but they had no clue what was, so they were trying something out.  And for most of them (let us not forget Mike, my favorite character) the whole punk thing didn't stick.

If you view the movie through that lense, it was fantastic.  Lillards performance was outstanding.  The music was great.  The script was very witty and entertaining.  And yes, I imagine the punk movement in SLC, if there ever was one, was pretty lame.  I know it was in the midwest where I grew up.

14215,4,0767837398,"SLC PUNK is an entertaining romp through 1985 subculture with sarcastic, disillusioned, and sometimes volitile main characters as the social environment into which we are immersed. The reason this works so well is that it gives viewers a unique look at life from a very disorganized and idealistic viewpoint. The main character, Steve, and his friends all seem to have very idealized views of what the world should be and they are forever comparing it to the poor quality of their actual surroundings in Salt Lake City.

Through short backstory pieces, we gain a sense of characterization and motive for each of the main characters, although their motivations may be at once alien and unclear. Still, this is one of the qualities SLCP has going for it: however confusing, terrible, or reckless the characters, they are truly real. Honest-to-goodness people. They're messy, annoying, endearing, profound, and fun depending upon the scene. Far more fleshed out than most Hollywood characterizations, the people in SLCP can affect viewers because of their flaws. Sympathy is gained through watching them make stupid decisions or ones that seem poorly thought-out.

The plot at the beginning is admittedly a little rambling. It is clever that the movie takes place in so few backdrops and yet each scene has its own feeilng of ""space."" Social hierarchies exhibited in the punk subculture, deviance as defined by Steve and his friends, and the fine line they walk between true self-expression and parody are all themes dealt with fairly well.

Perhaps the only flaw in the movie is a lack of precision. Understandably, the plot is somewhat haphazard in its progress: after all, this is about real life with these characters, not a constructed plot. However, the damage occurs when characters go off on somewhat unbelievable tangents and then go off to do something that has little relevance to the rest of the plot.

Despite its flaw, the movie is a gem when speaking of characterization and dialogue. The organic quality of the lines adds to realism. The individual characters connect with the audience at different times throughout the movie. Viewers will likely find themselves saying, 'I've often had the same worry' or 'That makes so much sense to me.' These characters have many of the same flaws and insecurities that likely lurk in our own minds.

The treatment of two themes drive the movie and make the most lasting impressions. They are the desire to leave a mark on the world and to find one's place in the book of history; and, the desire to understand and synchronize with others.

Finally, the last act of the movie is profoundly moving, a new high point of brilliant writing, talented acting, and atmosphere. Do not pass this movie up: the message, the acting, and the characters are excellent.",1110499200,,2805,4.995717344753747

Matthew Lilliard is very natural and believable, and Michael G. is also excellent.  There were so many quirky smaller characters that the movie was very colorful all the way through (not just the hair..). I didn't feel like there were enough ""turning point"" scenes until the end of the movie; if they had inserted a few other key moments I think the audience would have been more invested in Matthew's character.

14228,4,0767837398,"If you're going to appreciate ""SLC Punk,"" the 1999 film by writer/director James Merendino, you need to have grown up during the 1980s. The film, taking place in Salt Lake City in 1984, hits all the right notes when documenting rebellion and music of the period. The lifestyles, attitudes and different cliques which spun off from American punk rock have been accurately detailed. Most importantly, the story transcends the era, revealing the frustrations of youthful rebellion and the angst of American suburban living.

There's a thread connecting ""SLC Punk,"" ""Quadrophenia,"" ""Easy Rider"" and ""Rebel Without a Cause."" The protagonists are cut from the same cloth - different eras, same story. ""SLC Punk"" has also been compared to other films detailing punk rock, most notably ""Suburbia"" and ""The Decline of Western Civilization."" ""SLC Punk"" comes far closer to the emotional truth of this 1980s American subculture. I related to almost every scene, though found the ending to be melodramatic. Why can't characters evolve due to changes within rather than the tragedies of others?

To see the beginnings of punk rock, all one has to do is view the extraordinary Sex Pistols' documentary ""The Filth and the Fury."" The anger and the music eventually spread to America, reaching such humble burgs as, according to this film, Salt Lake City. Fights with rednecks or frats were commonplace, and this is properly detailed. The chaos of concerts in small venues highlighted by thrash dancing and stage diving is expertly portrayed. The all-night parties, where wildly diverse styles including Nerds and Mods mixed with Punks, are recreated to great perfection.

""SLC Punk"" documents all of this with a feverish style. The film is narrated entirely by our main protagonist Stevo, brilliantly portrayed by Matthew Lillard. This was the Reagan era, in which a movement to return to old values and traditions alienated the seeds of Woodstock. The styles of punk however, were eventually as rigid as a Southern frat house, and this is noted in ""SLC Punk.""

In ""SLC Punk,"" we are much closer to our parents than we care to admit. This is emphasized during Stevo's hilarious conversations with his father, a former hippie turned lawyer who has ""bought in"" to the system. Played by Chris McDonald, he accepts his son's rebellion and tries to understand. Dad's a bit lost, but his love for his son is never in doubt. It's a multi-dimensional portrayal which is a highlight.

The final conflict of ""SLC Punk"" comes at a rapid pace, the spiral begun by an impromptu acid trip in a park leading to yet another all-night party and a drug overdose. Stevo doesn't leave the punk scene more than he evolves, as most of us do in life. There's a tendency by hardcore faithful to downgrade this film because Stevo transforms rather than giving the world the finger. He reaches his breaking point, splintering off into his own individualism. It's an oddly touching moment, spiced by an incredible flashback as Stevo takes Rush off the turntable and plays Generation X for the first time. Suddenly, the road becomes clear.

Who among us cannot recall instances from youth in which everything made sense - the translucent flash when the path cleared and we witnessed our definition? Moments like this are painful to watch because they are so truthful. Youth is pain, and ""SLC Punk"" is a uniquely executed slice of it.",1109116800,11,3389,4.989380530973452

I was like, ""Was that it?"" A few days later I had the urge to watch it again and I didn't know why. The second time around was my coming. I understood what was going on not only in the movie, but I also felt like I knew what was going on in the characters heads as well. It became clear to me that this was an actual way of life, and instead of being stereotypical to society's standards, I learned that people like these characters can be good at heart and still be themselves. It was an excellent movie and I think everyone should give it a chance. I was really moved by it and have watched many times, because it's a movie where everytime you watch it, you learn something new, whether it be about life, judgement, or whatever you make it.

It wasn't meant as a rallying cry for punks everywhere, it was the writer and director's vision to point out the fallacies in the so-called ""anarchist punk"" lifestyle.  Stevo (played by Matthew Lillard) is the loud-mouthed interpreter of the scene in SLC, but as the film progresses he becomes unsure of himself and what he's doing.

However, my main point in adding ANOTHER review to the 187 that exist:  WHO CARES IF IT'S PUNK!!!!  Or, for that matter, if it isn't!  All of these reviewers who bother to whine and moan about how ""not punk"" the movie is... why?  Didn't the characters and the film itself seem to mock the ever-present ""punk/not punk"" war?  SLC Punk doesn't try to be hardcore.  It doesn't really appear to TRY to be anything, aside from a lovely look at the confused nature of any radical philosophy:  the blind rush for money and prestige as well as aimless rebellion.
For that matter, who cares if it's an ""accurate portrayal"" of the punk scene of the time?  It's not a documentary, it's a fictional movie.

Yes, it does make you laugh, ecspecially when Stevo, Bob and Eddie go to Wyoming to get some ""real"" beer. But it also makes you think. And perhaps it will make you cry at the end as well. Whether or not this film portrays the punk way of life back in 1985 doesnt matter. This film is not just about punks and the punk way of life. Im sure its not even supposed to be. It is about growing up and teenage rebellion. Its about fear, death, life and love. Its about realizing who you really are and realizing things cant stay the same forever, no matter how much you'd like them to. One thing I liked was how well Matthew Lillard portrayed Stevo. Throughout the movie, you felt all his emotions and when it was done, you felt like he was an old friend. Despite the large amount of swearing, drug use and sexual scenes, I think this is a film most people will enjoy, maybe even relate to. It receives my highest reccomendation. Pick it up today.

14260,5,0767837398,"SLC Punk stands for Salt Lake City Punk, when I first heard about this film I simply said ""what the hell does SLC stand for?"" This movie takes place in 1985,which is genius showing the early punk years. That's why your not going to see any Green Day, Rancid, or The Casualties t-shirts or posters. But they do talk about the ""Sex Pistols"" and the ""Ramones"" The thing that caught the corner of my eye was that James Meredino decided to shoot this film in 2:35:1. Shouldn't it be in 1:85:1? But I guess that's James Merdino's style. For a movie which they only wasted eight hundred thousand dollars, it looks pretty damn good. It looks like they wasted more than eight hundred thousand dollars.
This film is about two punkers named ""Stevo and heroin Bob (Matthew Lillard and Michael Goorjian) who are college graduates who's dream is to make pure anarchy all over the country. Stevo's dad is a lawyer, who wants Stevo to go to Harvard Stevo has the grades, but he doesn't want to go with the system. After hardcore punk shows, and punch of drugs taken in, the two punks don't know what to do in Salt Lake. Heroin Bob doesn't really do heroin, infact he is scared of needles, that's why they call him that. What really caught my attention in this film is Til Schweiger  and how well he played his character mark. My favorite scene is when Mark explains how his whole family died, I know you will love that scene. Til Schweiger did that part so well it deserved an Oscar.  This film talks about the history of punk, and what a punker thinks.
This DVD includes audio commentary by Matthew Lillard, Michael Goorgian, and writer/director James Meredino. The commentary is really funny. What I noticed in it was the fact that they mentioned they took out some scenes, so where are all the deleted scenes? This DVD also includes the trailer for this film, and the movie ""go"". It also shows art stills from the original comic book. There's not a behind the scenes look, but I guess it's still cool. There is a lot of flash backs in this film, which when Stevo goes back into talking to the person you go, ""woo I forgot he was talking to that guy"". It is fantastic to see those effects. If you listen to punk music, or is interested in the punk philosophy, you need to watch this slightly twisted film.",1080345600,7,2291,4.465393794749403
14261,5,0767837398,"This was an intelligent and fun romp through the Salt Lake City Punk scene from the Mid-eighties.  It is the story of Steve-o, essentially the ""poster boy"" for left wing punks in the SLC area, but also essentially believed to be one of the more intelligent people in the area too.
Steve-O is played by Mathew Lillard of ""Scream"" or ""Scooby Doo"" fame (he played Shaggy).  No.  This is NOT your typical Mathew Lillard performance, though his zany personality DOES come out some in his character.
The first time I saw this movie in any way, shape or form, I started watching near the end of the movie and it was one of the more confusing, worthless movie experiences I've EVER had and it really turned me off to the possibilty of this being a good movie.  Then I moved in with a roomate who owned the Video and was ""forced"" to watch the movie.
It's a great flick about politics, ""punks"", society, love, and life.  I really like the characters, the way the film shows the growth of all the characters, and I feel the side bar things, such as narratives and explanations of scenes (the fight scene with the rednecks being what I'm referring to) are great for showing a point, moving the plot and also justifying some scenes to punch up the movie a bit.
Well worth your time, this small film is definitely a film to watch.  Some of the scenes are nearly stolen by the man who plays Lillard's dad, as he has a great performance too.",1076889600,,1425,4.419847328244275
14262,4,0767837398,"SLC Punk! (James Merendino, 1999)
Matthew Lillard, in the main, makes mediocre movies. So when I stumble upon something like The Curve or SLC Punk!, I find myself pleasantly surprised. The boy IS capable of acting, he just doesn't seem to do it all that often.
SLC Punk! is the deceptively simple tale of two punks, Stevo (Lillard) and Bob (indie film favorite Michael Goorjian) trying to survive in the counterculture of perhaps the country's most boring metropolis, Salt Lake City, Utah. Professing a belief in anarchy and a general confusion about such heavy topics as drugs, the opposite sex, and what punk really is, the two, coupled with various fringe players, spend long hours cooking up ways to take down the system without ever actually doing so. That is, when they're not partying.
While Lillard and Goorjian are the centerpieces, some of the fringe roles are just as well-acted and engrossing. Star Trek cutie Jennifer Lien plays Stevo's on-again off-again soulmate, while Bob falls in love with X-Files' Annabeth Gish. Christoper McDonald, forever branded with the stigma of having played Tappy Tibbons in Requiem for a Dream, does a minor but wonderful turn as Stevo's dad. James Duval, Summer Phoenix, Devon Sawa, and a host of others all also pop up in minor roles.
Like its main characters, the movie seems to have no direction at first, but ends up being more than just your typical slice-of-life flick. There is meat to these bones, and it's quite fine. Recommended for more than just the novelty of seeing Matthew Lillard actually act, for once. *** ",1076284800,3,1570,4.9245283018867925

Obviously you missed the last five minutes of the film because it totally proves that this movie's intentions were not to be ""realistic"".
Overall, this is a great movie. It'll make you laugh, perhaps it'll make you cry, but overall it'll make you think. It's very funny and clever, a great watch if you're lookin' for a movie to rent. However, I must agree in the fact that it's probably not worth the 18 dollars that most websites and Hot Topic want you to shell out.",1076025600,,637,4.398305084745763
14264,4,0767837398,"While this is a wonderful film and I thought it was greatly entertaining, most people reviewing this film seem to be reviewing the accuracy of the subject.  Well, the accuracy and whether or not it was ""punk"".  Well, that really wasn't the point of the film.  It wasn't a documentary, it was a comedy-drama about a ""punk"" (which is debatable) who must decide whether to conform and persue a good career or continue his life as an anarchist out to destroy modern society.  It was very funny and entertaining, but most people watch it judging it as a ""punk"" movie for the ""punx"".  For example, one girl remarked that straight-edge should have been a subject in the film.  Well, I'm guessing she's an emo-kid because they are the only ones who seem to think that straight-edge was the most important thing that happenned during the early era of punk.  If you were into the PUNK scene, you would know that it straight-edge was a movement popularised by A Minor Threat in the late 70s in Washington DC.  Of course, since they listen to EMO and not PUNK they think that Dischord was the most important thing to happen to the scene (since it relates to emo), and basically everything that was important about the scene was washed into the background.  If you're going to critisise the film based on accuracy, at least know what your talking about.  With that aside, I would recomend this film to everyone, because it is a funny and interesting film.",1074902400,2,1442,4.6196078431372545

It was a thrill to be reminded of seeing bands like the Circle Jerks back at the Speedway.  It should in no way be used to compare with any movements existing today.  For a lot of us it was a fresh and vibrant scene that died by 1990.  Society has changed too much.  I feel like it is a fairly accurate depiction of a lot that was going on in SLC back then.  Salt Lake counter culture likes to rebel against the mormon stereotype and the punk scene was a perfect format for this.  There was a lot of posers back then and a lot of kids who did not internalize what they were expressing, they just followed the stereotypes.  The acting is good, the soundtrack is excellent beginning right of the bat with the Exploited.  Stevo concludes that it is best to change society from the inside out and this conclusion is a real gem and makes the movie worth seeing for anyone.",1074816000,,1042,4.165
14286,3,0767837398,"Set in the year 1985, SLC (Salt Lake City) Punk stars Matthew Lillard as Stevo, one of two punks caught in the heart of conservatism in Salt Lake City, or Salt Lake Sh*tty, as they would say.
Never being a big fan of Lillard (Scooby Doo, Wing Commander, Scream), I waited nearly two years before picking this movie up.  I have to say I was impressed by his portrayal of Stevo, along with the rest of the movie.
Many of the ideals of punk are explored, a lot of times in narrative, such as anarchy, rebellion, fighting, drugs, changing the system, sell outs, poseurs, music, and random chaos.  I really didn't get a sense of the true punk scene, not like I did with Sid and Nancy, but this movie was entertaining.
Basically the movie follows Stevo and his friend, Heroin Bob around and documents their existence.  We get a view into their politics, social circles, lifestyle, relationships, and their difficulties in being a part of the counterculture in conservative America.  The film tends to bounce around somewhat erratically, but that seemed in line to me with the subject matter.  There are a number of very funny scenes, including one involving a trip to Wyoming for alcohol. Utah sells alcohol, but the sale of such spirits is highly restrictive.  I especially enjoyed the ending, even though I did see it coming, but Lillard's performance during the scene really helped to make it work.
A good supporting cast, an excellent music score, and fine direction work together to make this movie worth looking into, especially if you have any interest in the punk scene in America during the 80's.  I didn't get a sense that it was completely representative of the movement, but maybe it's not supposed to be...I don't know.
There are some decent extras, including a commentary track by the director and some of the stars, an isolated music score, a couple of trailers, production notes, and an SLC comic book (not an actual comic book, but one you can view on the screen).  Oh yeah, if you are easily offened by the liberal use of profanity, you might skip this one as the cursing comes fast and furious.",1074124800,12,2107,4.675675675675675

It really helped my friend get outta bands like Good Charlotte, Sum 41, Blink 182, etc. He started buying stuff like Fear, Dead Kennedys, Stooges, etc.
 So this movie kicks ass, and also shows this band ""ECP(Extreme Corpral Punishment)"" I don't know if they were an actual band but the were awesome! It also made fun of the Sex Pistols, which was a cool point-of-view. While also for the emo kids it showed a big emotional side to the movie at the end.

14289,5,0767837398,"Finally a good movie. Hadn't seen one of these in a while. This movie is a perfect representation of punks in the 80s. Todays punks have become smart, and have adopted the individuality belief instead of anarchy. This movie I believe gets it point across. It also is very unique. The scene at the punk show is pretty acurate to todays punk shows, but the punks of today don't party. They fight for a cause. Also this film does a great job at exposing posers, skinheads, mobs, metalheads, punks, and new wavers. SLC Punk starts out entertainingly enough as a sarcastic snapshot of the punk-rock scene in Salt Lake City in 1985 and is complete with mohawks, moshing, and vague avowals of anarchy. But gradually, the wanderings of Stevo and Heroin Bob turn into a multilayered exploration of character and culture shock. Though he spends his days drinking and mocking the values of his parents, Stevo turns just as critical an eye on his own rhetoric and lifestyle, and comes to find that aimless rebellion may be just as hollow as the mindless pursuit of money. No character has the right point of view; there are no easy solutions. SLC Punk sustains its energy through wit, realism, propulsive editing, and excellent performances from Lillard, Goorjian, and the rest of the cast. Did I mention plot. Yes the plot is great. It's emblematic of the movie's sophistication that Stevo's lawyer father is treated satirically without being dismissed; though baffled by his son's form of rebellion, he never loses hope that Stevo will go on to law school and continues to cajole Stevo and argue with him about how the world works. By its end, the constantly shifting perspective of SLC Punk achieves a surprising emotional depth. All in all at the end Stevo becomes anything but a poser. Now that he thinks for himself, and has a purpose for his rebellion, he's become a punk all of us punx would be proud of. Forget the critics, and the poseur anarchist out there. This movie is an accurate portrayal of the 80s punx, and thus you must keep in mind that we've changed. Although there are more poseurs out there than there are real punx.

Following the character of Stevo, played by Matthew Lillard, it gives outsiders a look into a different culture showing the ups, downs, and the truth about anarchy that no one wants to see but everyone knows is true.

SLC Punk is the most over-acted, lying and fully just... nothing-ness movie ever made to show the 80's punk scene. Mathew Lillard... his costumes were just awful, they looked nothing like the punk of today let alone yesteryears. And Heroin Bob's hawk was one of those mohawks you see these kids running around today with. Now don't get me wrong, Im not an 20-soemthing year old who grew up in the 80's, Im a teenaged girl, but I feel like I've somehow have been cheated of my lifestyle in many ways. About an hour or so into the movie I seriously had to turn it off. It was a waste of my time along with money! Oh and another thing! The portrayal of other lables were completely wrong.. since when do Mods beat up Skins an Nazis? that is not correct seeing as Mods are Pasaphists{{Sp}} and I know damned well that most punk don't get beaten by jocks. The way they made Neo's and Skins look wasn't right at all, for one piece of proof.. most Skins aren;t Nazis. But anyhoo, this movie was just awful and it made everyone look heinous.

For anyone who has lived the suburban life this movie will seak volumes about you, volumes you may not even realize.  The thing that speaks to me more than anything else in particular is the idea of doing something esle with your life, and punk being a phase of growing up.

This was one of the highly anticipated films that was released at ""The Sundance Film Festival"" in Park City, UT, a couple years back. Alas, there's virtually no plot, and no good dialouge. The incessant use of the ""F-word"" in SLC Punk - gets really old after a while - it made me want to cringe! Why couldn't the director of the movie go by the adage that ""less is more."" There's a lot of meaningless subtext, and a bunch of cavorting teenagers, who like to ""go-against-the-grain."" It authentically portrays the SLC Punk scene: you know, the spiked hair, mohawks, plenty of black leather and body piercings. It's about a bunch of young aspiring punk-rockers (anarchists/mallrats) - who at times - border on suicidal tendencies; where there's lots of drug-use; and the main characters making total jackasses out of themselves. Being from the SLC area, I was expecting a scintillating perfomance from these guys. (I wish they could've behaved themselves, in a dignified manner.) IT WAS FILMED IN UTAH, OF ALL PLACES! I THOUGHT IT WAS SO AWESOME! I saw some familiar scenes in SLC Punk: the [Mormon] Temple, the University of Utah Campus, and West High School. SLC Punk, wasn't what I was expected. I was so stoked about this movie from the beginning - and then all of a sudden - my excitment died down. I love punk music, through and through. It's just that, this movie came up way short. I didn't, however, get to see SLC Punk at the film festival, which is why I picked it up at the video store. This movie was so disappointing. There's not a whole lot I can say about SLC Punk, other than I think it's a complete waste of time and money. This movie is rated [R] for: Profanity, Vulgarity, Drug Use, Teen Partying, and Violence.

I myself use to be into that whole scene and it brought back memories of things that I wanted to forget and things that I just did.  The seting of the movie is absolultely brilliant, Salt Lake City is painted as this dreary place that is starved for culture, when really that is what it is.  This was Matthew Lillard at his finest, before he got exploited by that fag Freddie Prince Jr.  This movie represents what the punk lifestyle is and what it will eventually lead to.  The chracheters are so expertelly done that I found pieces of myself in them.  Another thing I was happy with was the bands that they use in the movie.  THey didn't go with completely well knows bands all the time, but was happy to hear The Dead Kennedys, and then some undergroung bands from Brittian.  I think this movie won something at the Sundance Film Festival, and it hsould of.

My criticism isn't even so much that I disagree with the film's message (I'm not THAT unfair).  What we have here, quite simply, is a very poorly made film.  Everywhere you look there are lights and microphones in the shot, the characters are very poorly drawn, there is no shortage of pretentious dialogue that sounds like it was written by some depressed kid in high school, and the acting is UNBELIEVABLY bad(excepting a few bit parts).  I realize that the film is done with a ""punk"" ideology in mind, but if that were the case, the director/writer obviously knows nothing about the punk scene, other than the fact that its vapid and lame.

14338,4,0767837398,"Before I go into depth concerning the film, I must say that in all honesty-this is a good movie.  Not a great movie.  Not quite much of anything to make it truly ""amazing"".  But an overall good movie.
I feel as if this movie erratically weaves between being ""amazing"" and, well...overacted, badly edited/directed, and just plain lame at some points.  Furthermore, and more importantly, the movie is predictable.  Extremely predictable.  I don't want to give spoilers (because I HATE it when people do that and this movie is worthy of a viewing san-spoilers), but then again you practically get spoilers by watching the movie itself, but for those who have seen the movie-I'm speaking specifically about the overdose scene (which leads to a scene containing a rare gem of acting provided by Lilliard.)  This movie has convinced me that Matthew Lilliard is completely underrated by the industry and stuck in roles of dunces and fools for no good reason.  I'm not one to cry in movies, but that scene brought tears streaming from my eyes and sobs from my throat.
Also, I personally thought that the scene of Steve's bad acid trip was an amazing and overlooked scene in the movie and example of film today.  It is an interesting example of the choices in editing used in this movie (in fact, really, the only good example-this movie could have been sooo much better with different angles, etc).
now I've noticed how some are bashing this movie as non-authentic/poser/whatever, but something has to be remembered here-that this was a movie shot in 1998 about 1985, not a movie shot in the 80's  focusing on the mid 80's (I'm referencing surburbia, obviously...poser...)  but imagine if we made a movie based on punk in 2002.  That scene at the mall still rings true today in our world of hot topic and the rest of that (junk).  The fact is that this movie is a parallel to our world today.  If it's not Reagan then its bush, the state liquor store.  And most importantly, we're still listening to the Dead Kennedys, Ramones, Velvet Underground, and (not to fail to mention) west coast like Blondie-all in this movie. All still relevant.  And yet we're still lab rats on a giant spinning wheel, just like Steve and Bob and the rest of them.  Struggling in America.  Struggling in the world of conservative order.  Struggling in the world of SLC.
Overall, this movie weaves between greatness and mediocrity, comedy and drama, punk and poser.  But worth your time.  Well, well worth your time and money.",1042070400,2,2495,4.769230769230769

For those who say either, I say go get a documentary on punk rock and watch it. This movie is not intended to be a documentary on punk rock. It is about a young man at a crossroads in his life and must choose the events that will lead to the rest of his life. Oh yeah, this young man happens to be a punk. To say the character Steveo or the scene he is in does or does not sum up punk rock is absurd. Punks are as diverse as any other group of people. It would be like watching a movie that's lead character is a 40 year old white man and assuming that he represents EVERY SINGLE 40 year old white man alive. Anyways, our lead character Steveo has hit a point in his life where his beliefs, mainly his belief in anarchy, are not adding up as well as they once did. He sees his friends going in different directions(one is a bum, one is going off to study Botany, etc.) and he now has to choose his path. That is the bottom line in the movie. Along the way you meet Steveo's friends, hear him go off on hilarious speeches about anarchy and punk rock, heartbreak, drugs, drinking, and oh yeah, beating the hell out of rednecks. Does this movie wrap up punk rock in a neat little package and present it to you? No. Is that even possible to do? No. What the movie does is tells a great story, throws in a lot of great music, and features a lot of great performances. I recommend it highly. Very funny, very entertaining.

14359,5,0767837398,"Been there, done that, seen that.
If you grew up in SLC during the 1980s you have no excuse not to watch this film and verify that everything Stevo says really happened, if not to you, then to someone you personally know.  I loved this film because it was told with a perspective of someone who is so intimately threaded into the fabric of this strange SLC culture as an outsider (non-Mormon transplant).  SLC of the 1980s is more like this movie than the Mormon stereotype the rest of the world thinks exists for 100% of us SLC-ites.  LOL!  SLC does a LOT to TRY to shed it's stereotypical image of Mormonism to the rest of the world.  These guys help take that job to the nth degree.  WHY?  Mostly because SLC can be SO BORING!
I've tried to get others to watch this movie because it is so worthwhile to explore an aspect of American culture that isn't often seen in film -- covered in such an intelligent manner.  Those I've asked to watch the film look at the cover, see the young punks and title and refuse to even consider the time to watch it.  Believe me, the cover of the box has nothing to do with the depth and quality of introspection you will gain by immersing yourself into this quality guided tour of the SLC  underground culture in such a way that ONLY SLC can do it.  (The movie is right, we are NOT normal here.  You can't duplicate this kind of perspective anywhere else, you couldn't change the title to any other city name.)
What would I like to see?  Another film by the same director looking at the equally juxtaposed strangeness of the Goth scene that the SLC Punk scene evolved into during the early to mid-90s.
What would I like to see after that?  Another film by the same director looking at equally juxtaposted strangeness of the Metal scene that preceded the SLC Punk scene which evolved during very late 1970's and crossed over a bit with the SLC Punk scene.
Don't believe SLC could possibly have such anarchist attitudes, in such a conservative environment?  Just how many times have you seen SLC anarchists on national news in the past 10 years?  Straight Edgers, Animal Liberation Front, Skinheads, for example. It's just too bad it has evolved into some violence that seems to be growing.  It didn't used to be that way at all in the '80s, well, except beating the crap out of ""the cowboys"".
My ""most true"" highlights from the film:  1. The fact that not all Punks LOOK like punks (the geek guy). 2. The fact that the surrounding states north of Utah are more like what the rest of the world thinks of Mormons than is SLC (Evanston, WY trip).  3. Posers in the malls (you know they only dress like that to go to the mall -- they wouldn't be caught dead looking or acting like a Punk at home or in school).
Like I said, ""Been there, done that, seen that"" (including being a student at the U, intimately involved 1978-1984, encouraged others along the anarchy line until mid-1990s, now I miss it all -- thanks for the movie to bring back the memories).

I'll put it this way: SLC Punk has EVERYTHING.  Comedy (Matthew Lillard's monologues really had me going - they'd be good forensics readings if not for the language, which I guess some people are sensitive to), romance (I guess you could call it that), insight, and action.  Well, comedic action.  You know the deal.

Although there is a story to it, that really isn't the point. It mostly explores the values that Steveo holds as he begins to come to terms with himself, and find his niche in the world. The soundtrack complements the tone of the movie, providing some basic punk sound. It was really a highly emotional film for me, there were lighthearted humorous scenes (like the trip to Wyoming, THAT was funny), as well as some dark and even teary parts near the end. The ending was something I enjoyed, seeing Steveo find his place, while not really leaving the punk idea behind.

14378,4,0767837398,"Naturally, me being a huge fan of punk rock, I loved this movie. The music was great. In fact the whole story was great. I only have one complaint. The creators of this movie obviously had no clue whatsoever what anarchy or anarchism is. Anarchy is rebellion against the system, government and/or status quo. Anarchism is the belief that the government and system is bad, and should be removed or completely changed. An anarchist is someone who believes in the theory of anarchism and/or performs anarchy. The creators of this movie seem to think that the idea behind these believes and acts were to create chaos. Not true. Anarchists believe that doing this will create a BETTER system. Not a chaotic one like these movie producers think. Many of the so called anarchistic acts performed in this movie were not anarchy. But simply law breaking acts. This distorted definition of anarchy got quite annoying while watching this movie. For this reason a star was dropped.
My favorite part of this movie was when one of the characters was trying to figure out what kind of punk his dad is even though he isn't a punk. He was like ""I know, you're a Nazi!"". Then the dad said. ""What! I'm Jewish!"" ""Oh even WORSE!"". I also liked the part were another character said ""Man, this guy was the most hardcore kid I ever knew. Why I remember one time, when he decided that all the cars on the street would look better without their wind shields. So he..."" I laughed then too.

Opposingly, if you think Black Flag is just for pest control, then don't bother - you just won't get it!
Matthew Lillard (more famous for roles in Scream and 13 Ghosts etc., etc.) is outstanding in this early role in his career and a final dramatic scene with Lillard shows just how talented this fine actor really is.  The film is a well-developed character study of Steve-O & Bob (et. al) and the performances and dialogue are exceptional.
It transported me, as the viewer, straight back to the mid 80's, of days and nights spent in the Channel and The Rat in Boston.  With a goofy smile plastered on my face, I watched these guys move around from: the package store, to the clubs, to the all-night house parties; and in the midst, scoop up all the punker honeys to boot!

The characters are bland and one-dimensional, preventing any interest in their ""struggle"".  Although I am not a punk, if the entire culture consists of wearing ugly clothes and trying to get by without working, then I think I'm better off for it.  This culture and movement should consist of intellectuals concerned with figuring out how to create change in the issues that concern them and developing organization within the culture in order for all involved to survive without having to join the system.  The characters in this movie are not punk.  They are bored, rich, spoiled kids who need attention and have nothing better to do than ""rebel"".  Its no wonder that the main character ends up selling out because he got scared by the image of seeing one his friends end up homeless, begging for change.  He didn't realize that the movement was unrealistic, he simply realized that he was a poser all along.  Usually I find good aspects even in bad movies.  Unfortunately, this movie had none.

Stevo is the type of punk I knew in my days as a punk/goth. Thoughtful, smart, generally kind and deeply soul searching. This movie is a wonderful trip through the actual formation of Stevo's adult life. It's shares the same sort of questions that most teens/young adults go though - ""Who am I? What am I doing here? Why do I have to be this way? Is there a higher purpose for me, for life?"" but, unlike most other deep teen movies, this one does it with much humor and some really great acting.
In some people's opinions, Stevo ""sold out"". He didn't sell out, he grew up. We all grow up, we all leave our outer shell behind, but we never lose the inner core of how we think, even if it evolves and shapes through the years. I too would probibly be very disappointed in my self if my teen self was looking back at me now.
To me, this movie is one of the few movies that actually comes close to chronicalling what it was like for me as a teen to grow up ""different"".

It captured the no-cares attitude I've had for a while, but it also showed some of the end result, without damning the middle to uselessness.

Like fight club, SLC is a tale of a growth: from anti-establishmentarianism to the abandoment of extremism and, like fight club, it is done with reckless abandon.  There are flashbacks within flashbacks; extreme violation of the fourth wall convention and comic book-like expressionist special effects.  It is also like Mean Streets, with its gritty low-budget feel, the intense method acting and directing, and blistering soundtrack.  The opening still is straight out of Goodfellas ""all my life I wanted to be a gangster.""  But most importantly, the film has the pacing that makes both directors so enjoyable...the movie moves.

Quirky, intriguing characters.  Funny incidents.  But then it spins off into a deep, emotional drama.  This completely floored me, and I loved SLC Punks! even more because it.  **I can't say this movie told much of a story, and I don't think it was meant to.  This movie focuses on character rather than plot, which is beautifully illustrated by the non-linear sequence of events.  Stevo and Bob are introduced as 1985 SLC punks, but slowly become two people searching for themselves as the film progresses.  **The acting here is absolutely fabulous.  Matthew Lillard(Scream) gives us a spectacular performance, complete with much facial expression.  The most powerful scene in the film is undoubtedly when Stevo finds Bob the morning after Brandy's party.  He's lost and tortured, and those tears and facial torments are so real it's shocking.  He's lost not only his best friend, but his inspiration, I think.  After all, wasn't Bob the truest punk of them all?  Michael A. Goorjian(Hard Rain) gives a fabulous performance as well, for an example watch the scene when he is confronted with the needle at the doctor's.  He played the part of the neurotic, paranoia-stricken, hardcore punk true to the last thread.  I personally thought Trish, as well, was very well played by Annabeth Gish(The X-Files).  **Whether or not this film's focus is poseurs and punk depends how you look at it.  Although they are undeniably important elements in the film, I drew very significant meaning from the characters themselves, not their lifestyle.  Stevo's journey through various stages in his life had a huge impact on me as a person.  But I suppose ""poseur"" is an integral part as well.  Stevo and Bob spend their whole punk life trying to be as hardcore as possible, and being called a poseur is a horribly degrading insult.  This had an impact on me as well, because in trying to be so ""hardcore,"" maybe Stevo began to lose touch with his true character.  And I think that is the beauty of him.  **Watch this film.

Matthew Lillard is great as Stevo, an achiever who can't find a constructive way to channel his energies, filled with anger about the hypocrisy of the mainstream world he must one day join.  Michael Goorjian is also very good as Heroin Bob, a gentle non-conformist who is terrified of illicit substances.

Lillard and Heroin Bob's acting is great here.  Lillard is paticularly excellent and is great at being the narrator for the film.  While I've been told by several people that are into punk that the soundtrack is lacking in their minds, I thought that the music played fit perfectly into the context of the movie.

14440,5,0767837398,"It is easy to see more in a movie than the writer put into it. It happens because the movie matches part of a personal experience and we graft on the rest of the experience. So, what follows may or may not have anything to do with what the writer, director, producer of SLC Punk was trying to say. It is about my personal reaction to the movie.
I grew up in SLC and was a teenager during the late '60s and early '70s. I was part of a tribe known as the freaks. We considered the hippies to be conformists, punks hadn't been invented yet, and we couldn't stand red necks. A friend of mine owned a black caddy EXACTLY like the one in the movie and we used it to make road trips to Wyoming to buy beer. I have hung out at length at all the locations used in the movie, if not the actual houses, then the neighborhoods. So, I found myself identifying strongly with Steve-o. And that is where I start putting my own experience into the meaning of the movie.
To me the movie is about the human need to belong. When you are rejected from the rest of society you will join any group that accepts you. You will adopt their point of view and convince yourself that you believe that point of view. Most people do not have the strength to break out of this trap and go slowly crazy trying to balance what they really believe against what they must pretend to believe to conform to their group, their tribe. Steve-o, once confronted with the conflict between his actions and his beliefs, break free of his posed life and proceeds on with what he really wants.
SLC is the perfect place to set such a movie, and to live it, because it is a place full of hatred and intense pressure to conform. It is the intensity of the hatred that drives the intensity of the rebellion.
SLC Punk is the life story of many many people who are from SLC and Utah, as far from it as they can get. It is also the life story of a punk I know from Lubbock, Texas, where a local football hero got away with running down and killing punks for sport. It may even be the story of why the people of the US put our own citizens in concentration camps during WWII, and many other sad days in human history. To me it is an enduring story of the effects of blind unreasoning unthinking hatred by one group against all others. And, it is a story of the courage needed to break out of traps we build for ourselves to defend against all that hatred.",990662400,,2400,4.174568965517241

I see a lot that a couple people down the line of reviews could not see, could not comprehend.  One such reviewer is too hung up on the music.  If I could show him 2nd South in Salt Lake during the mid 1980's, he would see why SLC Punk is an amazing piece of truth from beginning to end. I see it as very plausible that punks would hang out with those not of their so called ""kind.""  I know because I was one of those who floated in-between the ""tribes"" as the film says.
One funny thing is, the drive out to Wyoming.  To me, it looks like the road out to Nevada, but then, that really isn't important, because there are more important things about the film and the wonderful humor inside of it.  I especially like the essay that Steve O tells the audience.

The term chaos, which is the foundation of anarchy, was the backbone of this film.  All was good in the beginning, when two punks were trying to live the life of a true anarchist, which in their mind was to fight system.  By fighting, partying, and generally causing havoc, they felt that they were making a difference.  After living this redundant lifestyle, the lead character Matthew Lillard has a revelation, where he finds that his life is leading nowhere and his strife as a punk means nothing.  A state of confusion and disorientation follows, where Matthew comes to terms with what he must do.  He falls for a girl who basically says that all he stands for is worthless, and in this he finds truth.  Finally, his best friend Bob dies, and all his confusion comes to a closure, when he decides to make something of his life, and fight the system from within.

14484,4,0767837398,"I caught ""SLC Punk"" primarily because I had been so impressed with Matthew Lillard's work in ""Hackers"" (see my earlier review). However, I was drawn right into the movie as I recognised myself & many of the people I had known in the early 80's on the screen.
It isn't just personal identification that leads me to recommend this film. ""SLC Punk"" is a classic coming-of-age story about the angry young man too intelligent for his surroundings, questioning the values & lifestyles of those around him. Since JD Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye"", every generation has had it's defining story of this type. ""Repo Man"" & ""Drugstore Cowboy"" are earlier movies that came to mind while I watched ""SLC Punk"" for similarities in attitude & style. I was particularly impressed with the cinematography of the ""drug"" scenes; they caught the visual jerkiness of LSD very effectively.
Matthew Lillard's performance as Steve-O was dead-on & very touching. He definitely stands out altho the rest of the cast is uniformly fine (if unknown)!
Of course, the soundtrack rocks! From the ironic anger of the closer (the Dead Kennedy's ""Kill the Poor"") to pre-punk classics by the Stooges & Lou Reed (punk's godfathers) the choices of music are always interesting, if sometimes surprising.
Whether you were an 80's punk or simply a fan of well-done, non-Hollywood ""product"", ""SLC Punk"" is worth your time; anyone who has ever rebelled against anything will find something they can relate to here.",976147200,4,1471,5.0081632653061225

First, anyone that thinks  watching this movie makes them a punk is wrong. It's not meant to be some  kind of punk culture symbol. Many of the stories included are from the  director/writer's own experience. Many of my punk friends simply wrote this  movie off as ""for poseurs.""
But, the movie isn't meant to be  any source of punk culture, but a story about punk culture in the early  80's. How anyone could make a judgement on this movie without realizing  this is beyond me. Maybe they are just too caught up in keeping their image  of ""punk"" that they forgot to have fun and enjoy a good movie  once in a while.
This movie is great and it's not just for punks.  Everyone I show this movie to that doesnt try to judge its  ""punkness"" enjoys it. The movie will make you laugh, think, and  cry. I know I did. But, maybe I'm just a poseur and not ""punk""  enough for everyone else.",968716800,2,1077,4.315

But Heroin Bob played by Goorjian is completely overacted and  ridiculous, he ruins every scene he is in with his inadequacies.  One other  thing, will someone please get the acid trip right.  The director of this  film has chosen to go the traditional Easy Rider acid trip route which is a  total wreck.  I'd love to see just once an accurate portrayal of LSD  consumption on the big screen (check out Fear and Loathing).

14518,3,0767837398,"This is a high-energy youth angst movie, set in 1980s Salt Lake City. Matthew Lillard is Stevo, protagonist punk and narrator. The movie basically tracks his post-college life in SLC as he tries to define just  who the hell he is, along with his long-time buddy, Heroin Bob (who's one of the only characters with even an iota of credibility to him, especially when stacked up with Stevo -- incidentally, the Steve-o from ""Jackass"" and ""Wildboyz"" is infinitely more hardcore than Lillard's Stevo -- hell, for the little poserkids out there, watch ""Jackass"" to get a better understanding of it!)

Without  wanting to spoil much of this movie, because it really is a lot of fun, I  have to say that I think that Stevo's father IS the screenwriter, and he's  confronting his younger self in this movie, and reconciling his lifestyle  choices. There are patchwork references to anarchism and punk throughout  this movie, but for anybody who knows about either of these areas, it's  clear that the writer doesn't get it. How do I put this: it's a punk movie  for posers, or for people who don't know jack about punk.

How do I know  this? Well, it's clear that Stevo is a shirtsleeve rebel from the start;  only people who put a lot of faith in appearances and lifestyles could  possibly believe he's anything but that (I mean, he mall-rants at length about how US hardcore is so much better than UK punk, but their punky party van has the Subhumans and PiL spraypainted on it -- hello??)

All the punk stereotypes/cliches appear in  this movie - dyed hair, mohawks, leather jackets, and so forth. But anybody  who really gets punk should know that there isn't a look to it, not if  you're for real - nobody should look like a punk, or look like an  anarchist; punk was about anti-fashion, about genuine nonconformity, about  being yourself; anarchism is about self-expression and liberation. This is only practiced by two of the characters, and is pointed out by another. The  rest are charlatans, and they don't even know it. I blame the screenwriter for ""Cashing In"" on punk's popularity at the time.

Because I knew Stevo was full of (sh)it from the beginning, his journey's end came as no surprise to  me, his ""revelation"" wasn't revelatory. Still, it's an enjoyable  journey, anyway. The soundtrack of this movie is excellent, despite the movie it's wrapped around.",957657600,35,2365,4.770935960591133

Throughout the movie we see Stevo's character evolve from a hardcore punk,  to an ""open minded"" yuppi. I guess people say it doesnt have a  plot line because they don't understand what the Dead Culture is all about,  they think punk is Blink 182 singing all about fart jokes. Punk in essence  is a political statement to all the oldschool fascist closed minded people  in power.  And thats what this movie portrays. Not only that the soundtrack  is supeb it contains songs from when punk still had integrity (featuring  the Dead Kennedys). Is it worth your money? Hell YEAH! Get it, get the  soundtrack.

14536,5,0767837398,"One of the best movies I have seen since Kids. If your a punk or use to bee one, you need to buy rent or steal (well not really steal-unless your Stevo) this movie. It is funny, and chaotic all at the same time.
It's about these two friends that beleive in anarchy (not in the UK) and they go  around beating up rednecks just for the fun of it. But there is a moral to  this story . . . well watch it and you shall learn, cause i'm not giving it  away.",950659200,,452,3.7872340425531914
14595,5,0767837398,"SLC Punk is a great movie, but not exactly what I was expecting. I expected a movie about punk kids stuck in the Mormon citadel of Salt Lake City. And while that is the basis of the movie, that's not really what it's  about.
What it's about is a punk guy named Steve-O and his friends that  spend all their time partying, doing drugs, and beating up rednecks, etc.  Eventually Steve-O starts to question the punk values he thinks are  important to him. In the movie, there is a lot of talk about posers, but in  the end Steve is a poser too.
I thought there would be more involving  conflicts with the Mormon religion, but there are suprisingly few. Even so,  SLC Punk is a great movie: all the performances are great, and the  direction and visual style is great to look at. The colors are bright and  vibrant, like the youthful energy that the movie exudes. The movie is  hilarious - Steve-O's rants and speeches about anarchy and violence are  great and the various scenes and flashbacks are very good.
One thing SLC  Punk lacks is a plot. It's really just a bunch of stuff that happens. It's  quite good though. See it.",949190400,5,1123,4.419512195121952
14596,4,0767837398,"This is a good movie.  It's pretty good and the drug scenes might give you flashbacks.  This isn't Trainspotting...this is the neighborhood punks who later became computer programmers, television producers, etc.  You'll be  disappointed if you are looking for a movie about the hard life  punks...these kids have problems but it's hard to have too many problems  when you live in a big house, parents give you money and food, and get  school paid for.  This movie is about rebeling even when you aren't down  and out.
Interesting and a pretty good film showing that even in Utah  you can rebel.  Even if for only a little bit.",948412800,2,626,4.703703703703703

14598,1,0767837398,"This is a bad movie, straight up boring.  ""SLC Poser"" would be a more appropriate title, since the real crux of the film (which is explicit in the bumbling script) is protagonist Steve-O's realization that he has no  investment in any of the values he claims to hold so dear.  Neither does  the film, of course, and this movie is the cinematic equivalent of your  parents telling you you'll grow out of it.  If you're anything like the  punks in the movie, you will.  The version of punk shown here is like a  hissy fit being thrown by a spoilt child.
Perhaps worst of all this  film's crimes is the totally inappropriate production value.  MTV-style  quick cutting and super glossy film stock give this movie the atmosphere of  a Saturday morning cartoon, albeit one where ""f you"" is the tag  line that all the talking action figures say.  Steve-O's obnoxious mugging  and his sidekick Bob's lame ""dude""-isms only make this worse.  Even at its most superficial, punk is always gritty and unrefined, these  production techniques are more suited to ""hackers""-esque  technopop flicks.
I usually enjoy punxploitation film, but even the  soundtrack here feels tacked-on and jumbled.  Good punk films like  ""Suburbia"" make the punk elements feel organic, and have at least  a hint of empathy.  I never felt a thing in SLC Punk, even at the hackneyed  tragic ending, because who cares what happens to a bunch of rich frat boys  with mohawks?  Besides, every punk in this movie has perfect skin, so you  know it's just Hollywood exploitation.",947894400,10,1535,4.822393822393822
14599,4,0767837398,"Being an ex-punk (my punk years were 1978-1983) I didn't expect much from this movie. what a pleasant surprise! Rather than the fashion clones most movies portray, the punks were all individuals, no two the same. Matthew  Lillard was absolutely brilliant. I agree that he is probably one of the  best and most under-rated actors of his generation.
The soundtrack was  HOT too! They included many of the bands that were part of punk's eclectic  mix, including Roxy Music (mother of pearl at that!), all the way through  the Dead Kennedy's.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 was that the  punk scene was portrayed as much more violent than the one I experienced.  Then again, I was in San Francisco at an earlier time - perhaps SLC punks  were more into thrashing.
Even the commentary on the mods was  appropriate! The entire film had much more depth and was much more  thought-provoking than other more ""serious"" films I had recently  watched.  One other caveat - I would have liked to see more women with  short hair. Try this movie - it will surprise you!",946512000,36,1061,4.574468085106383
14600,5,0767837398,"I love this movie. It reminds me of my friends. This movie is brilliant, and possibly the funniest movie I have seen in a while. However a great movie exhibits more than one characteristic, this does. It shows that  growing up sux, especially in a small town where you are the minority. The  ending is a bit depressing and makes you really look at life in and see it  is not all fun and games. BUY IT you will see how the punk seen today,  isn't really punk.",944438400,5,458,4.170454545454546

14602,5,0767837398,"This movie is true.  Look at SLC now-and then, this movie beautifully orchestrated the actual lifestyle of punkers- my friends and I follwed the ethic- back then, and still do today.

14603,4,0767837398,"Beautiful, well directed, well acted, this will be joining my library. However, the story of a privileged rich boy going punk in rebellion against his parents, embracing anarchy to give himself respectable purpose,  discovering that anarchy is as senseless as his rich father's lifestyle,  then in the end, selling out (or buying in) is not a new theme in coming of  age films. Further, Stevo's high self esteem, strong sense of self, and  rich kid background are not, in reality, typical of the SLC Punk scene.
Lillard's performance is stellar and the story catches the effects of  living in a religiously oppressive state gloriously. The acid trip scene in  the park was brilliant.",943833600,3,683,5.0
14604,4,0767837398,"The movie SLC Punk portrays the punk rock lifestyle with more accuracy than any other Punk Rock movie I have had the pleasure of watching. (besides Another State of Mind) If you ask anyone that was once a punk  he/she can tell you similar stories.  Geeks needing a place to belong,  Punks realizing that their rebellion is wasted fighting the system instead  of working to change it, and Parents just trying to understand ... this  movie the entire movement can relate to.
  The movie also boasts a  great soundtrack with the music of Fear, The Stooges, Minor Threat, Suicide  Machines (Although not a band in 1985, when the movie was to have taken  place) Dead Kennedy's and more.
  This is a must see movie for anyone  who was once a punk, or anyone questioning their punk rock lifestyle.  Anyone who may disagree with my current view of punk rock should look at  their blue hair in the mirror, and think if you would hire yourself for a  job.",943660800,4,945,4.535714285714286
