8343382,4,B001UE66B2,This is the oldest television series in my DVD collection and for that reason alone I treasure it.  As mentioned already the episodes are in kinescope.  The production side is also far from perfect.  A lot of it has a low budget look and  feel to it.  But that's the reason why these episodes are great to have.  This is television at its earliest and it's great to see it in its infancy.  I enjoy seeing the many up and coming stars as well.  It's a shame this set has gone out of print.  If you love vintage TV you're sure to enjoy this.,1425340800,,539,4.105769230769231

8343384,5,B001UE66B2,"INFINITY's 90 episiode SUSPENSE collection consists of six slimline cases that hold two DVDs each. These are stored in a stock paper outer sleeve. Image is full screen, audio is clear but only within the range of early TV broadcasts (good bass, limited high end).

These dubs are from antique kinescopes, a process in which a film camera is pointed at a TV monitor and synched so that it doesn't capture a raster flicker. The sound is particularly clear, undoubtedly because audio was directly patched from a mixing board. Video quality is a bit grainy and similar to other kinescopes in that the picture's edges are missing and the view favors one side of the screen. I notice a slight tilt to the right.

When the long-running SUSPENSE radio program made a jump to television in 1949, several crew members and show scripts also came along. Of greatest prominence are director Robert Stevens and organist Hank Sylvern. Stevens also directed several dozen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alfred-Hitchcock-Presents/dp/B000AL733G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alfred Hitchcock Presents</a>&nbsp;TV episodes. Sylvern was organist on a number of radio shows and the composer of themes for ""The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin,"" ""Strike It Rich"" and others, plus the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tom-Corbett-Space-Cadet/dp/B0028ZI8E0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tom Corbett, Space Cadet</a>&nbsp;TV series. He was also an orchestra leader.

I like best the earliest ('49) episodes of SUSPENSE in this fine collection, for they illustrate how post-war TV was a ""learn as you go"" process. These programs with live AUTO-LITE commercials run over 29 minutes each. It's impressive to see actors under the pressure of a live broadcast hit their marks, get their lines right and emote without overdoing it. Because of Sylvern's ever-present organ, SUSPENSE on TV is much like radio with pictures.

Of the dozens of TV series DVD collections in my home library, the 90 Lost TV Episodes of SUSPENSE are among my very favorites. They're not perfect by any means, but they are perfect examples of what television was like over 60 years ago. Highest recommendation for fans of historic ""live"" TV broadcasts.

8343385,3,B001UE66B2,I've just started to watch these but so far they are hard to watch because they are so old and the stories aren't that great.  Nice to see some early performances on tv by Karloff-waiting for the Lugosi spot.  The organ playing was annoying I would have preferred no live soundtrack!  Hopefully they will get better but I'm not holding my breath.,1321747200,,346,4.548387096774194
8343386,5,B001UE66B2,"I must say I agree with the other reviews about the quality of this show.  If you buy it expecting the quality of picture etc. used in ""Twilight Zone"" or ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"", you will be sorely disappointed.  What is does offer, is a rich lesson in television history. This is television in it's infancy, experimenting, growing and learning it's craft.  First these shows are the kinescopes made of LIVE performances to be used in rebroadcast to the West Coast. I can only imagine how stressful and difficult it must have been to switch from multiple cameras etc. for the technicians,  and how incredibly distracting it must have been for the actors to have to perform, make costume changes etc. at that pace,  while avoiding the cameras and technicians needed to do the broadcast.  The shows had to be performed in the time span of the show's slot, unlike filmed shows which had the luxury of multiple days to film and the ability to do retakes, set up closeups,  etc, and were confined to the cramped studio,  since locations could not be switched. (There are a few crudely filmed bits added to try to serve as location and transition scenes in some episodes.) The actors were also ""working without a net"", so to speak,  since there was no possibility to fix it if there was a mistake.  In ""Comic Strip Murder"" Lilli Palmer moves from one part of the set to another and a camera operator from the previous shot is clearly visible over her shoulder!  Camera work is also occasionally blurred especially while trying to move in and out of closeups.  So what makes this show 5 stars in my opinion?  First, I think it's fascinating to watch them accomplishing so very much within the limitations placed on them by the crude technology of the period and the limited budgets.  TV, being almost an experimental medium in 1949,  couldn't have attracted the kind of money from sponsors it does today.  Secondly, the casts!  There is a mixture here of established stars of their day (Karloff, Palmer, Lugosi, etc.) and lots of fresh faces just getting started (Paul Newman, Anne Francis, Eva Marie Saint, Brian Keith, Cloris Leachman, etc.). So, if what you most want is early television entertainment, go for Hitchcock, Twilight Zone, or Thriller (all excellent suspense tv series which would possibly have never existed if Suspense and other shows hadn't paved the way) but, if you want the added bit of knowing you are watching one of the major industries of our modern life being born, this show is for you!",1293840000,17,2511,4.748847926267281
8343387,4,B001UE66B2,this dvd set brings back memories of early television with commercials from the late 40's and early 50's. It would be a good addition to the true collectors library.,1255996800,8,165,4.724137931034483
8343388,3,B001UE66B2,"This was a very low-budget live TV series from 49-53. For comparison The Lone Ranger and Superman made at the same time was vastly superior. Most of the stories are poorly developed but there are a few gems. For the price, a chance to see future stars in early roles, and as an example of early TV it is worth while.

I did have to send this back several times because a number of the discs rattled in the player and wouldn't load. I have 3 players and found that the better the player the less likely they were to work.",1252886400,20,520,4.148514851485149
