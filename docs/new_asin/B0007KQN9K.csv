However disc would not run at all & while Amazon was kind enough to refund my money past the 30 day period, I nevertheless still don't have this workout.",1342828800,,300,4.084745762711864
2216772,3,B0007KQN9K,"I cannot understand why Leslie's Slim, Shape and Sculpt series, of which this tape is a part, did not appear to have been as successful as some of Leslie's other programs.  The idea behind the series seems to have been a sound one--using the ""Walkblaster"" inclined surface to do lunges and squats--simultaneously exercising the biceps and deltoids with light weights--then returning to brisk walking. I personally like most of the emphasis on this tape being the thighs and gluteals.

Leslie instructs her audiences that ""two of the best exercises you can do for your entire body are lunges and squats."" She tells us that the lunge is ""one of the best exercises to do to shape and thin your thighs"" and ""if you master them you are going to have great legs."" I agree as do many exercise experts who recommend them.

Perhaps the problem was that Leslie herself did not seem as energetic on this tape as she does on her future Walk at Home series. In fact her students seemed a lot more energized than she did!  Also although you CAN break a sweat doing this tape it is not as easily broken as say the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leslie-Sansone-s-Walk-Slim-4-Fast-Miles-2-Disc-Set/dp/B000OYCMMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leslie Sansone's Walk Slim - 4 Fast Miles  (2-Disc Set)</a>&nbsp;tape Leslie did later on. Still I think I will continue to use this tape and the others in the Slim, Shape and Sculpt series as strength training to augment my aerobic exercise program. I would recommend it to others as well.",1281139200,7,1556,5.183266932270916

8047975,3,B0007KQN9K,"I actually bought this DVD as a set with the other 2 DVD's in the series which had the Walkblaster included.  I can't seem to find it now so I'll review just the single DVD.  The concept here was good and I looked forward to getting this workout.  To combine the walking workouts with a ramp so that you're actually stepping up, I anticipated a great workout.  Alas, it was somewhat of a let down.  I'm an advanced walker, I've been using Leslie's DVD's about 5 years now.  I own 20 of them and do one a day.  I have to work really hard with this excercise routine just to get warm.  It's impossible for me to break a sweat with it no matter how hard I work.  The main problem is that she alternates between a segment of cardio walking and a segment of sculpting excercises.  The sculpting session is very slow and the cardio segments aren't long enough to get my heart rate up and break a sweat.  Another issue is during the segment that she uses the hand weights.  Again, a really good idea since not only do you get a bit more of an upper body workout, you're also forcing your legs and abs to carry more weight which always gives you a better workout.  Even during this segment, I can't break a sweat though.  I use 3 lb dumb bells which is really the maximum amount you want to use if you're moving around with them.  She does bicep curls, overhead press alternated with a stretch out to the side (nice), a bicep curl alternating with a tricep kickback, and overheard presses without the out to the side stretch.  I saved the overheard presses to the last because I wanted to make an additional statement on this excercise.  Strangely, she does these in time with the music which is far to fast for this type of excercise when using weights.  You want to do slow movements with weights, not jerky movements.  Very odd and I wondered what she was thinking when doing that.  Okay, I got the negatives out of the way but there are some positives regarding this workout so I hope you're still reading.  I do like the fact she uses the hand weights which gives the upper body a boost but she doesn't use them enough.  But the main positive on this excercise routine is that it will build up the muscles in your legs.  She does a lot of squats and lunges, far more than on her other DVD's.  I have strong legs but even I started to feel it a little which means it was pretty intense.  She does squats alone and then lunges alone, which is the best way to do them to get the most out of the excercise but then she does the combo which is stepping forward into a lunge and then stepping back into a squat.  I've never been a big fan of combining the two because it doesn't give you enough time to go into a full lunge, it's just a kind of half lunge.  Using the walkblaster is kind of fun.  She does quite a few excercises where you're just tapping the colors on the walkblaster which, to me, is no better than tapping the floor, what's the difference?  I prefer the excercises where you actually have to step up on the walkblaster and step down, that's more intense than regular walking.  However, the walkblaster is only a couple inches off the floor so it's not really a strain no matter how many she does.  The music is kind of boring on this DVD, hardly motivating.  So, I guess my suggestions is to look elsewhere for a better workout.  Leslie has a lot of great DVD's out there, skip this one.  That said, since I bought this DVD, I do still use it occasionally, about once a month.  It's only 40 minutes long so I use it for a mid-week workout if I'm in a bit of a rush and don't want to get myself all sweaty and have to shower and redo my make-up.  It gives me a decent workout, especially with all the lunges and squats.  You don't need an exhausting workout everyday, your body needs a rest.  This is my resting workout!",1441756800,,3829,4.252077562326869
8047976,4,B0007KQN9K,This mixes aerobics with upper and lower body toning. I use leg weights during the slower step moves to rev it up and increase my lower body toning; the upper body moves are good to add calorie burn but don't do much to tone your arms - I like using heavier weights to do that. But I do like this series when I need a varied workout and an easier version than using a step.,1435536000,,373,3.986666666666667
8047977,1,B0007KQN9K,I brought this product & it was very misleading.  I didn't receive the stepper that is shown on the cover & in the description it don't tell you if the stepper is included.  I tried to search for the stepper & I couldn't find it. They need to pull this DVD if they aren't going to include the stepper machine as shown.,1427760000,,318,4.112903225806452

This is good for getting up heart rate and I like to use the lean board when its nasty outside, and wish I could go for a walk - so, do this instead. It's not hard and anyone can do this one, if you can do a Richard Simmons video, then you can do this one.",1372550400,,341,3.5
8047982,5,B0007KQN9K,"I am a Leslie Fan and in looking through the different DVD's of her's on Amazon I came across these Walkblaster versions of a program she did. I decided to order all three in the series even though the Walkblaster ramp is now unavailable to buy. I didn't know what the expect and if I would really need this ramp during the exercise. As always in Leslie's workouts you can do it with or without the walk booster so I was happy I ordered.  For an advanced walker however these are easy, but I do like having these in my collection because I use the easy ones when I have those days when I'm not really wanting to exercise that way I have at least done some form of exercise for the day.",1359763200,,685,4.150375939849624
8047983,5,B0007KQN9K,This is great for beginners to use a ramp. I am using a step instead and it works for me. It is a small change to the walking videos.,1356825600,,133,3.6206896551724137
