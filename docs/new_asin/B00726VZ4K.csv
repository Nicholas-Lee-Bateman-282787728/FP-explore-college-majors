We consider ourselves to have a fair amount of computer knowledge, however, this was very hard to follow & understand !  We thought that this was a computer disk that you put in your disk drive & just follow the prompts & fix your computer, that was not the case !  We will return this product for a refund !",1381708800,2,480,4.129032258064516
8508769,5,B00726VZ4K,"This is amazing. I first saw this kit on ""As Seen On TV"" and it was $60 back then, now it includes Windows 8 for this low price. Just like it says. I learned how to not only cleanup my machine, but how to remove the FBI fake virus that was on my computer. I can confidently say that I should be able to remove future viruses also. Thank you.",1363478400,,341,3.8857142857142857

For shame.",1358812800,24,247,4.25531914893617

I cannot begin to explain how much money this has saved me. I highly recommend you give this product a chance.",1353801600,3,286,4.314814814814815
