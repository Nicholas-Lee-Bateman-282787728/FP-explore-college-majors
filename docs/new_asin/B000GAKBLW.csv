2602953,3,B000GAKBLW,"This is primarily a cold war espionnage thriller for the first 2/3, and then a chase film for the last 1/3.  The brutality of the spy game is evident, so not really for kids.  The lead character flashbacks to Vietnam are more a nuisance than a revelation.

There is a five minute ""chase"" at the beginning of Eastwood by a Super Jolly Green Giant/Sea Stallion helicopter as he jogs for home in a remote area to evade his ""pursuers"", the authorities that are trying to contact him for a mission.

There are flashbacks with stock footage of Eastwood as a F-105 pilot over Vietnam.

There is the finale with a decent looking imaginary plane, in full size mockup and model work.

There are several items that bother me.  Eastwood's acknowledgement of the Soviet radio transmission admitting to who he is and that he stole the plane is not how the spy game is played.  This is more likely a chance to thumb his nose to audience approval.

His recording of the flight in case he doesn't make it all the way back is also a bad idea, since it could just as easily fall into Soviet hands, thus confirming Americamn involvement.  It is probably to give the audience a running narrative of what he is doing and why.

Landing a geared airplane without skis on an open ice flow at high speed without damage is doubtful.  (The underwater submarine shots are taken from Ice Station Zebra.)

Finally, the whole ""thinking in Russian"" weapons system seems very unlikely even now.  A more sophisticated eye/voice system would have been believeable.",1459382400,,1528,4.652985074626866
2602964,5,B000GAKBLW,"I know the pace of the movie is slow for most viewers. However, I like the slow builds in spy movies and Firefox does not disappoint. I admit to only wanting to see the plane when I was younger. However, as an adult, I find the movie is still good and I was even prompted into finding a copy of the book to read. An excellent movie all around. Clint Eastwood delivers.",1459209600,,368,4.125

This film is not suitable for kids under the age of 16, at least in my family!  Since I had watched the film so long ago, I completely forgot how violent the film is.  I showed it to my kids and had to tell them to close their eyes while I fast-forwarded through the bloody scenes.  I profusely apologized to them later.  This film is more like a PG-13/R rating.

2603012,4,B000GAKBLW,"It is the sub-plot of this movie that makes it an important movie.  That sub-plot is the exploitation of the genius of Jewish Scientists and Jewish organizational talent by an almost fascist government that is presenting itself as protecting the ""Worker's Paradise"".  The natural enemy of Fascism, in fact any highly organized, ""Imperial Culture Political Society"" is Judaic Culture and the Jews.  Jews ""Do not even have the right to fight City Hall"" as one of the men helping Air Force Major Gant steal an advanced MIG 31 fighter-bomber which is invisible to radar and is able to fly at Mach 4 or 5 speeds (Four or five times the speed of sound) fighter that can fly at over 120,000 feet and could change the balance of the Cold War.

It is too bad that the model of the MIG 31 that was created for this movie was less than realistic but our Government was not about to allow them to use any of its own pictures of our own advanced airplanes that we were developing at the time.  All of that information was and is still Classified.

The acting is solid and the political-moral-ethical issues that this movie brought up when it came out are still relevant to our society as the United States is deciding whether or not to stand up for Thomas L. Friedman's ""World Of Order"" as opposed the increasingly powerful, ""World Of Disorder"" that threatens to tear modern society and culture apart.",1431216000,,1388,4.59919028340081

2603031,5,B000GAKBLW,"Incredible US Air Force slash ""Clint Eastwood"" classic movie.  I saw this film as a young child, and watched it again as an adult and loved every minute of it.  What we have is a combination of a ""James Bond"" espionage intrigue tied with a military jet fighter adventure.

  This is by far among my list of all time greatest films.  Based on the exciting Novel of the same name, Clint Eastwood plays a US Air Force Vietnam War veteran who suffers terribly from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder due to the time he was held prisoner by the ruthless Viet Cong Fighters.  Years later Eastwood's character is a retired Officer living in the wilderness of Alaska, dealing with his mental and emotional trauma inflicted upon him inside the torture camps run by the NVA.

 In England, a military intelligence expert contacts the CIA and Pentagon, informing them of an alarming situation regarding Russia's secret stealth jet fighter program that could threaten the West's strategic edge defensively, preventing the stability between the two disrupting world superpowers if this jet fighter were to be developed fully inside the Soviet Union.

  The intelligence officers believe that Russia's KGB is holding the world's premier aviation scientists hostage behind the ""Iron Curtain"" who are placing the finishing touches on the stealth fighter program which can fly using brainwaves and verbal commands in the Russian language.

 The Air Force tracks Eastwood down in Alaska, and tell him that his services as a heroic Airman are needed again.  A plan is engaged to where he is to infiltrate Moscow, and find the heavily guarded Russian Army-Air Force base where this top secret ""jee whiz"" jet fighter is being stored.  His plan is to disguise himself as the pilot and fly this magical jet to freedom behind Western lines.

 With the special effects used in movies like ""Dragonslayer"", and stars from legendary great films like ""Star Wars"" and ""Indiana Jones"", including the English actor who had played Darth Vader's naval commander in ""ESB"" as the KGB leader in charge of their stealth fighter program, ""Firefox"" is still to this day many years later a spectacular movie that in my view Clint Eastwood can place next to ""Dirty Harry"" & ""In the Line of Fire"" as one of his best.

 I absolutely love actor Clint Eastwood and all of his work (especially recently with his modern US Military movie about the late Chris Kyle ""American Sniper""), so if you are also an ""Eastwood"" fan then please take a look at this film.

 Five stars and thumbs way up for this military adventure masterpiece.  As an American military veteran, I love and swear by this movie.",1423094400,,2643,4.876681614349776

Yes, the plan looks silly by today's standards, and is obviously a model, but it's a good story and I love how Clint Eastwood has to come through so many problems and it doesn't seem like he can make it.

2603060,3,B000GAKBLW,"Predicating upon mounting fears of an 80s Russian invasion, Firefox Is basically George Peppard's Operation Crossbow with a superior Russian jet instead of top secret German missile technology. Despite being made over 20 years apart, the nap-inducing pacing of both films makes them more for enthusiasts of the genre than for a casual movie-goer. While the premise of Firefox was primarily dismissed as science fiction, Russia did have plans for a super bomber which could land on ice to refuel before reaching the US. However, those plans were scrapped in favor of ICBM technology. This film's value to us now is in demonstrating how this might've been carried out, but more importantly by precociously displaying thought-controlled devices which, just today, are finally being implemented and will soon be well within our grasp. It's for these reasons it gets three stars instead of two.",1408406400,,889,5.223776223776224

2603084,4,B000GAKBLW,"Produced and directed by Clint Eastwood - who also stars in it as Major Gant - this is not one of Eastwood's best directorial efforts...most of the superior Eastwood-directed films would come much later. Adapted from a novel of the same name by Craig Thomas, the Russian MIG 31 Firefox portrayed in this film was totally fictional. The real MIG 31, called a Foxhound, did not have stealth technology, was not capable of Mach 6; and did not have a mind controlled weapons system. But having said all that, this is still an excellent espionage actioner. I saw it in the theater back in 82 when it first came out and liked it...and have viewed it multiple times since then, liking it just as much with each viewing. This is certainly Eastwood's film as an actor and he delivers a fine performance. The support cast is good, but you likely will not recognize many, if any, of them.

This part of the film is a bit long as it attempts to explain why people take chances to oppose communism... without actually showing the negative consequences of communism. Then there is the flight of the Firefox, which utilizes less than perfect special effects. Gant's evasion of Soviet air defenses is unrealistic in places.

The fact that the movie is now over 30 years old hasn't diminished its entertainment value. However, I suggest that you don't embark on this adventure with a critical mindset because there is a lot of science fiction, which isn't realistic but it makes the movie all the more enjoyable.

2603176,5,B000GAKBLW,"From the get-go let me state that I was a huge fan of the novel that this film was based on, and was very stunned that the translation of that book into celluloid was equally as good. A freakish accomplishment given the notorious track record of such translations.

Also, let me preface that I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood. Long before he became the elder statesman of the film industry and winning several Academy Awards, these early directorial efforts proved that he was always much more than a rugged action star. In fact, I willingly suffered through films that I suspected I would dislike, simply to enjoy his performances.

Indications of his future brilliance were all on display in this 80's action/thriller.

Tells the story of Mitchell Gant, retired officer of the US Air Force. Having left the service due to what was then called Delayed Stress Syndrome, what we now call PTSD, Gant suffers intermittent and debilitating flashbacks when confronted with intense emotional situations; the illness grounding him into an early retirement. But a seminal breakthrough across the planet requires his very specific set of skills be employed once more.

Despite having access to thousands of current and former military pilots from across the free world, Gant is the lone aviator who fits a very specific profile needed for an emergency mission. In addition to being fluent in Russian and a former member of the Constant Peg Aggressor Squadron - US pilots trained in obtained Soviet aircraft and their combat styles - he's also a dead-ringer for a known heroine dealer.

As Gant is ""volunteered"" for the mission, it becomes clear that almost every intelligence and military officer involved in the secret project does not believe he'll succeed. With so many disparate parts and parties that have to synch perfectly, it's an unspoken but foregone conclusion that the effort is doomed. And any failure along the mission path equals tortuous death at the hands of the KGB -or- a lonely frozen death by drowning in the Arctic Sea.

For all intents, he knows this is a one-way suicide mission.

A very entertaining action/thriller with Eastwood guiding what could have easily wrecked with over-dramatization and collapsing into cold war hyperbole. His deft handing of the script emphasizing the thievery and thief - and less the geopolitical ramifications of a revolutionary combat airframe that threatens world peace.

Movie Notes:

- Firefox's author, Craig Thomas, wrote the novel based on his own air combat experience and strange rumors he had heard through the professional grapevine about a theoretical aircraft design that was said to be ""invisible"" to radar.

Though vehemently denied for a quarter of a century, in 1988, and nearly 12 years after Thomas' book was published in 1977, the United States announced that it had produced so-called stealth aircraft that were undetectable to radar detection systems of that period.

- The name Firefox is not the name associated with or given by the Soviet air force to their planes. Just as today with Russian aircraft, in the west we assign nicknames beginning with certain letters to help our forces quickly and easily identify opposition hardware. For example, the letters 'B' for bombers or 'C' for commercial. In the novel, an imagined MiG-31 advanced combat aircraft is given the NATO nickname of Firefox - 'F' for fighter.

Personal Note:

- I'm a fan of character actor Freddie Jones, and absolutely love his typical presentation of character: The professional who speaks with emphatic pronunciation overlaid with a personality of smooth knowing guile. Thought his performance was superlative as the MI6 officer who authors the fantastical plan to steal Russia's most advanced aircraft.",1366502400,,3748,5.114566284779051

The quality of Amazon Instant Video was disappointing: very jerky. That really hurts in the action sequences of a film like Firefox. I get better streaming on the exact same hardware from various TV show websites. I won't be purchasing Amazon Instant Videos again.

2603218,4,B000GAKBLW,"Given the ways this actor is often typified,and as he reminds us in the bonus feature as a type he is always trying to break and encompass some variety in his work, the same basic character is always at the heart of his roles. He is an old warner brothers stalwart,a company whoose heritage goes back to the beginnings of sound productions in hollywood,and that type of gritty character
we see in all his films in which a part of americana shines through,is reminiscent to the old stars of hollywod. The tough resilient actors who during the war years,and a few years afterwards, made their war films which were not always their best work,but are interesting facets of their overall career. The bonus features also show Eastwood in washington,and many of the military and governing class around Reagan,welcome him but likely Reagan himself is orchestrating these previews, of an actor making movies and roles in a high profile way of things occurring and values expressed in america. Of the actors in america,the modern actors,he is my perennial favorite for many years, although every which way but loose/any which way you can does not seem the best use of his talents,and he takes up this criticism in the bonus features, they were very popular and made him many fans. Whoose to argue with success! As warner now releases 35 of his films on dvd,I an old fan of his from his beginnings and has watched and enjoyed his success,and his creative work, will
rewatch and blog as to what i see in each film. I look forward to it,as I once enjoyed his films as they first came out. Of course when they put out such a large compilation of discs on one set,the actor more or less says here is my work,I probably will not do much more,what i've done is behind and that's what i've been, a fixture in hollywood and washington. Reagan sees in eastwood something he was not able to achieve himself,someone bringing the values of all those small towns and large city values to the screen in a popular way,he was always relegated to b films,making petitions to be in better films. Eastwood whoose films really have american topics and values at their heart,since he himself is front and center and in other ways, so its good to have someone doing something different in hollywood...even though his european friends keep bringing up his spaghetti westerns which they and we all miss...

This film has a literary source and it shows. It confronts the viewer and this is a different film being a spy caper than most of Eastwood's fare. It's the cold war. The opening prologue to the film in which Eastwood is imprisoned as a military person,caged in wood, and watched derisively by asian children and the character's mental disorder...it's in the background and stays there...and he is asked to rejoin the war effort,from vietnam,and the novel's source is britain,so we have britain and the u.s. in Russia,with a subplot about jews in
the Soviet Union, and the Eastwood character must steal a jet,built by jewish brains in the soviet union,and the british are involved here,and it's an interesting part of the film the Eastwood character,doesnt understand how they accept the jewish people,or others,having to die and accept what these foreign spies want? He is not really a spy,but an old american soldier of fortune doing what's good for his country,and making some money, which was not always understood in europe..and there are subplots about drugs,being brought into the soviet union,by foreign powers. An interesting look at the cold war,and the politics of what became the soviet union never recovered from the assassination of Rasputin which still haunts the world today,but a film such as this in which much plotting is reduced to 2 hours,so much remains unsaid. All characters are international or represent a nation,the individual is lost...an interesting film and a change of pace for Eastwood...enjoyable but not one of his classics a film previewed in hollywood,which i recalled seeing on tv at the time with much fanfare,the mayor of carmel who caused a sensation there(i still recall all these articles and footage)the man who became as an a actor what Reagan was never able to become,a fixture in hollywood which je remains..and i look forward to going over all these films again.

Apart from the steely acting by Eastwood, who looked so wound up that if he sneezed he would shatter, the balance of the main characters were British! And very good they were too, with the eccentric boffin superb played by Freddie Jones, and the Jewish scientist played by Nigel Hawthorne. Perhaps one might argue that that sometimes the acting tended more towards the ham than Hamlet, but overall it kept me on the edge of the proverbial seat, even after watching it many times before.

2603231,4,B000GAKBLW,"This tense 1982 adaptation of the Craig Thomas novel ""Firefox"" has Clint Eastwood as leading actor, director and producer of a high tech Cold War espionage thriller.  The movie includes what at the time were cutting edge special effects.

As the story opens, former U.S. Air Force Major Mitchell Gant is recalled to active duty for a special mission.  He has been chosen to steal a top secret Soviet prototype fighter aircraft called the Firefox (a stealth look-alike) from its base deep in the Soviet Union.  Gant, a Vietnam veteran suffering from PTSD, looks like a long shot for the mission, which calls for an ace pilot fluent in Russian.  Nevertheless, the CIA and British MI-6 launch him on the mission.

In a dangerous if improbable journey, Gant is sherparded across Russia by a network of spies and dissidents, just ahead of the pursuing KGB.  Gant reaches planeside about halfway through the movie, and the real action begins.  Gant must run a harrowing gauntlet of anti-aircraft missiles, Soviet fighters, and a failing fuel supply to reach safety, while flying an unfamiliar aircraft.

The movie is perhaps overlong, and there is an unintentionally funny attempt to substitute northern California for Alaska in the opening sequence, but the special effects are fun, and Eastwood is backed by a solide supporting cast of B actors in a suspenseful thriller.  ""Firefox"" is highly recommended to Eastwood fans.",1331769600,,1418,5.047210300429184

2603238,5,B000GAKBLW,"Wonderful film in every way. I saw this movie, no joke, when I was 7 years old. I went with my parents to see this. Looking back on it, the KGB kicking butt, lots of assassinations, plenty of havoc, probably not a Disney flick for kids, but what the heck!  I loved it as a kid!  I went with my parents just to see the MIG!

This movie was made in the Cold War, at the height of it. The funny thing about these Firefox and Red October movies is that they always portray the KGB and the Soviets as being on the cutting edge with the U.S. having to steal or copy or spy on their latest technical achievement. The reality was, despite beating us into outer space, the Soviets were the copycats!  The GRU and KGB gots its tech from Silicon Valley and stealing secrets from us!

Nevertheless, the scenes in the film where Gant (Eastwood) is trying to get through Moscow, in the subway especially, are very much fingernail biters.  The film creates solid tension and the action and intrigue are abundant.

The scenes of Gant stealing the MIG were great and the last part of the film, the chase, was well done for its time.  Warning: if you're looking for top-notch special effects a la Lord of the Rings, think again!  In 1982 at the theatre as a kid I felt like I was in Nirvana!  Now watching the movie, I still ADORE it, but wow the effects....pretty dang thin....It's just important to watch the movie in context of the times and use some imagination and have patience with things of that FX nature.  The ""think in Russian"" part? Probably the lamest of the whole film. Oh also, don't watch the altimeter of the MIG! It changes in each scene so drastically that I've read even a category 4 hurricane couldn't change it that much! LOL

Wonderful movie in general. I really loved it then and now.",1311465600,,1790,4.374622356495468

The cold war was real, the Iron Curtain was real and intact, and the Fulda Gap separated the free West from the communist East.  Ok, the special effects are nothing like they are today, but back then, they weren't too bad.  Back then, there were fears that the Soviets would come up with a better plane than we had so the story is logical.

2603242,4,B000GAKBLW,"For a taste of the Cold War at its height (and near its conclusion), Firefox is a great blast from the past.  They tried hard in the film to highlight all sorts of elements of the Soviet apparatus, including dissident scientists, Jews who were downtrodden and oppressed by the system, bureaucrats mindlessly following orders, the vastness of the country, and the intransigence of the pre-Gorbachev leadership.  The Soviet leader portrayed here is a kind of Breshnev-meets-Andropov figure, who is hoping for a technological leap above the Western powers.  This film also taps into the then-prevalent Western fears that the Soviets would make some kind of technological breakthrough that would tip the balance of power inexorably in their favour; of course, time would reveal that they were much more worried about our technological and economic advances with which they could never really compete.  But that's too complex for a film like this, which is already a spy-thriller, chase, and military adventure film rolled into one.  It succeeds for the most part on these levels - Clint Eastwood plays the still-having-flashbacks pilot drafted into the mission of stealing the new MIG-31, a plane so technologically advanced it can operate on mental commands, but limited enough that it would only recognise them in Russian (Eastwood played a pilot fluent in Russian).

In a somewhat strange role, Nigel Hawthorne (one of my all-time favourite actors) played the key Russian scientist, reluctantly but effectively developing the technology, but just as effectively determined to help it be stolen.  Many of the other actors are British, including those playing Russians and those playing Americans.  All are reasonably effective, though there are few stellar performances here.

The special effects are very good - John Dykstra of Star Wars fame produced many of the elements in this.  Scenes of flying in the cockpit and the dogfights between the planes are very effective; they were more dramatic, in all honesty, before Top Gun came along, but they remain rather good even in comparison.

In all, this is an interesting film, a bit overlooked now because time has moved on past the subject matter.  It is one of the earlier films produced and directed by Clint Eastwood, who has gone on to much bigger and grander projects, but one can see his touch here.",1297814400,,2354,5.117493472584856

They had it and wee wanted it. So we decided to sneak in and take it. The only problem was that to operate it you had to have Ruskie thoughts as it could tell the difference.

Out only hope was retired pilot Mitchell Gant (Clint Eastwood) but still a tuffy. His mission is to sneak into the USSR and pilfer the plane. Little did we know there is a second plane and a tuffy Ruskie pilot, so the chase is on. To add to the tension Mitchell was a Vietnam prisoner and suffers under stress.

Will he succeed or be shot out of the sky?

The story was probably inspired but the Soviet defection to Japan in the 70's when we pulled their advanced MiG apart to fined that while we moved on to electronic controls that they were still using wire and hydraulics. How ever when we realized it was immured to Electro-magnetic-pulse we had to take a sober look.

2603252,4,B000GAKBLW,"FireFox was made in 1982, with Clint Eastwood as star, director and producer.  It is a two part movie - a spy thriller and then a satisfying high speed MIG chase.  The fun begins when Mitchell Gant (Clint) manages to steal a high speed MIG under the noses of the Communists.

FireFox is a Cold War spy thriller that grabs you at the beginning - with Clint playing a Vietnam War vet who has flashbacks and is just glad to be out of the war.  Because he is uniquely qualified - fluent in Russian and a top notch jet pilot, he is the only person our government can find to have a chance at stealing a top secret MIG from a Russian airbase.  This is a cloak and dagger escapade - and one close call after another for Mitchell Gant.  Not only does he have to pass as three different identities, he has to hold his sanity together to steal and deliver the MIG to U.S. agents.  The rest of the cast plays a bit oddly against Clint's character, almost like a Batman movie.  Freddie Jones and Nigel Hawthorne are over the top.  Warren Clarke is more believable.  Ronald Lacey plays a Jewish scientist, in on the plot. I enjoyed the whole movie, however, the second half special effects looked more like a video game. The MIGS flying through deep canyons was deja vu Star Wars and still played out to be really great stuff.",1196467200,,1313,4.322448979591837
2603253,5,B000GAKBLW,"I'm partial to certain Eastwood films, especially the early spaghetti westerns which made him famous. This film is sort of a Cold War CAVIAR EASTERN.

Here, a long-retired, Vietnam-mentally-damaged Eastwood is tapped on the shoulder by the CIA to steal a new Soviet fighter-jet that is invisible on radar, the Firefox. (Clearly, the film preceded the unveiling of our own top-technology in that realm, which the Soviets never ever achieved). Eastwood, whose mother was Russian and so he speaks Russian like a native, grudgingly acceeds to the arm-twisting proposal and goes undercover behind the Iron Curtain. There, the CIA network ultimately gets him through a morass of close calls and to the Firefox, which he steals but at great cost of life to all the folks who helped him.

The final third of the film is totally focused upon his attempt to escape The Soviet Union with a second Firefox aircraft and a very ticked off Russian pilot (Eastwood had kicked his butt back at the Russian base), hot on his tail.

Of course, none of this could actually have been pulled off but it's nice to think that it COULD have happened, so, it's the purest form of silly fiction. But still, the film is well-conveyed, not hokey in any way.

Like John Wayne, Eastwood is the worst sort of actor, coming off as contrived and isolated from his supporting actors, but that is actually why most of us love him (and John Wayne too). Also, the special effects are very realistic in this film, well-done.

In the end, if you love Eastwood, you'll find this movie much to your liking, very macho and all. The stereotyped Russians (Soviets at the time), fully meet our western expectations of arrogance, bad temper, and ineptness.

If you're not a big Eastwood fan, I'd pass this one by as there are better choices in his film repertoire for the casual viewer. Don't look for anything deep and/or philosophical in this one -- it's a very straightforward flick, typical Eastwood really.",1194825600,,1964,4.795857988165681
2603254,4,B000GAKBLW,"Clint Eastwood was a great choice for the lead role in this movie.

While the airplane is an interesting focal point, I enjoyed more following the logistics and complications the intelligence service had to confront to get Clint to the airplane and then out of Russia.. Good entertainment, particularly for spy fans.",1180051200,,449,5.081081081081081
2603255,3,B000GAKBLW,"I'm not sure whether Firefox is really a guilty pleasure or simply a film I remember as being one. It's certainly overlong and overfamiliar despite its neat Maguffin - Clint Eastwood's flashback-plagued Vietnam vet fighter ace has to steal a state-of-the-art warplane with a thought-controlled weapons system (as long as you remember to think in Russian) from the heart of the Evil Empire - but it has a sort of undemanding Cold War charm that the constant stream of clich&eacute;s only reinforces. Even the old school model effects in the final chase-and-dogfight section are more fun in their way than modern CGI effects, especially when the Firefox is leaving a wall of water in its wake as it races across the sea or causing fallen snow to fill the air as it passes over the mountains, so it's a shame that much of the last third is played in darkened control rooms rather than the skies.

The Russians, naturally, are mostly played by British actors, albeit in this case actors best known for their sitcoms, which adds a different dimension to their scenes as comically humourless KGB types or lemming-like dissidents only too happy to die for the cause, or incorrigible hams like Freddie Jones who simply look like they SHOULD be in a sitcom. There's even an almost admirable perversity into giving most of the explanatory dialogue in the last half-hour to Klaus L&ouml;witsch, an actor with a shaky grasp of spoken English who sounds like a bumblebee caught in a vacuum cleaner pipe. Not good by any means, but strangely watchable, and Maurice Jarre contributes an enjoyable score from the days before he disappeared entirely into atonal electronics.

The Region 1 DVD is the uncut theatrical version before Clint re-edited and trimmed the film by some 12 minutes without visibly improving it for video release (however, the European PAL DVD is the shorter version). Boasting a good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer, it also includes a 29-minute British behind the scenes documentary and the theatrical trailer.",1177545600,,2012,4.9851190476190474
2603256,5,B000GAKBLW,"As a child, I was impressed by this movie's setting--the gritty, greasy depiction of the gritty, greasy life in the Soviet Union's proletariat interior--and the mesmerizing special effects that brought the MiG-31 to life.  As an adult, all of this came back to me, with the added awareness of setting, conflict, and dark penumbras.

This is a dark film.  So many people die in this movie: the first contact Pavel Upenskoy, the Jew scientists, the Soviet Pilot of the second prototype.  Once again, setting is key:  this mission is dangerous, death is probable, and failure more than likely.  This contrasts with the gala James Bonds movies which (at times) can be life action cartoons, and is a precursor to the high-tension, high-body counts in ""24.""

The special effects, thought dated, still hold up. Though they are not as sophisticated 2005's film ""Stealth"" or the opening scenes of ""Revenge of the Sith,"" I could ""piece out imperfections with my thoughts . . . And make imaginary puissance.""  I'm one of these people who still thrills when Buster Crabbe hops into his obviously model spaceship and blast off form Mongo.  Good storytelling can overcome bad special effects, as shown by ""Ghostbusters.""

Additionally, this film exemplifies how a book can be faithfully adapted to screen, without damaging the story or the theatrical presentation.  Of course, some of the credit goes to the way Craig Thomas wrote the book. It is minimalist character study of Mitchell Gant's psychodrama within the grim Soviet Union.  When Gant sweated, my palms became damp.

Yes, this film is a bit long, but like in ""2001,"" I think the length added to the setting. The only thing that really could be cut is the bickering of the Soviet Air Marshals and the Premiere.  However, that would detract form the setting aspect of the story.  We see the hoary heads bang heads as they fumble with the hot potato that Gant has lobbed at them.  Picture a cross between the Sith Lords and the Three Stooges, and you capture the tragicomic aspect of this psychothriller.

So, in the light of the Velvet Revolution, is this film relevant?  I think so.  In 1970, we had a double dose of military nostalgia--""Patton"" and ""MASH.""  In the midst of Vietnam, what did Korea or WWII have to do with anything?  In part, it has to do with the common elements of war, warfare, and the warriors.  C. S. Lewis spoke of a thought he had while in the service: ""This is what Homer wrote about.  This is War.""

Similarly, in order to defend life, liberty, and property, (the purpose of the military), we need to inculcate the warriors about the virtue and value of what they are doing.  Lewis again has important insight on this issue:

""Those who say that children [or even grownups] must not be frightened may mean two things. They may mean (1) that we must not do anything likely to give the child those haunting, disabling, pathological fears against which ordinary courage is helpless: in fact, phobias. His mind must, if possible, be kept clear of things he can't bear to think of. Or they may mean (2) that we must try to keep out of his mind the knowledge that he is born into a world of death, violence, wounds, adventure, heroism and cowardice, good and evil.""

""If they mean the first I agree with them: but not if they mean the second. The second would indeed be to give children a false impression and feed them on escapism in the bad sense. There is something ludicrous in the idea of so educating a generation which is born to the . . . atomic bomb. Since it is so likely that they will meet cruel enemies, let them at least have heard of brave knights and heroic courage. Otherwise you are making their destiny not brighter but darker.""

Courage is one of the values that this film portrays, not just with accepting the mission, but most epically as Gant deals with his own personal ghosts of Vietnam.  In this sense, ""Firefox"" is about redemption:  Gant, unable to save one Vietnamese girl, is able to save millions of lives by stealing the Firefox and to restore a balance of power between the two nations.

The other part has to do with aesthetics: this is a roping good spy and techno-thriller, and when we are done, we recognize that we have seen a marvelous tale told well.  And that is the hallmark of any good story.",1173830400,,4301,4.648148148148148
2603257,5,B000GAKBLW,"The movie is one of my favorites.  However, the DVD case is cheap, not like store bought.  It's a cheesy plastic with a piece of cardboard with cover art.  Remove the cardboard out of the slot and there's nothing there.",1173312000,,219,4.425
2603258,5,B000GAKBLW,"""Firefox"" is one of my all-time favorite adventure movies.  It is an adaptation of Craig T. Thomas' novel by the same name.  The novel has a brief introduction, and divides the story into two equal parts.  The movie expands the intro into a third part, almost equal in length to the other two.  It may seem slow, but I found it helped establish the story.

This is a cold-war era story, where the heroes are Americans and the villains are the Russian Government.  I always enjoy it when we are not the bad guys.  But in this story, not all the Russians are evil.  In fact, in a dogfight sequence you get the impression it is a fight to the death, not between two enemies, but between two people who respect each other, yet one is commanded to kill the other, and the other needs to kill or be killed.

A movie to contrast this with was Blue Thunder, directed by Ralph Bedlam, and released the following year.  There are a lot of similarities between the two.  The two main differences:  1) Firefox is more suitable for older children, having a 1982 PG rating, and probably been PG-13 due solely to violence today, while Blue Thunder is R-rated, and has nudity, profanity, and innuendo that was not necessary to the story, and 2) in Blue Thunder, it is our government that is the bad guy.",1162684800,,1287,4.4297872340425535
2603259,3,B000GAKBLW,"remember when the russians were the bad guys of the world and we were always close to an all out nuke exchange with them? well this is from that time.

2603260,5,B000GAKBLW,"When Tom Clancy came out with his first book THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER many people did not connect it to the fact that it appeared at the tail end of a short-lived movie-craze. A decade before, a former teacher in Wales Craig Thomas had written a book about the American military's quest to acquire the Soviet Union's latest super-weapon, a technologically advanced fighter that would leave the United States aerial defenses largely obsolete.
Of course structurally the two tales are very different and apart from both falling into the genre of techno-thriller these are two very different stories. But following the release of Clint Eastwood's adaptation of the Thomas book in 1982 the movie and television screens were strewn with tales of the latest technologically advanced [place mode of transportation here]. We had a super car in KNIGHT RIDER (currently in reruns on the Sci-Fi channel), and not one but two super helicopters with BLUE THUNDER on the big screen and AIRWOLF on television. It was only natural that a submarine, that most stealthy of all vehicles, would come in for the same treatment.
Yet what Thomas delivered in his novel was a perfect fusion of suspense and high adrenaline action adventure, a fact that Eastwood himself credited with his decision to persuade Warner Bros, to acquire the rights to the property on the 22:35 documentary included as a special feature on the disc.
In fact, despite this featurettes length, clocking as it does at a little more than 22 minutes, it does boast a wealth of information on the production of the movie and seeing it here had a special significance for me.
It was this very documentary that had led my family to sneak an 11-year old boy on the English-Scottish border into seeing this picture, despite that fact that it was certified (in the now defunct) AA, that meant that those seeing the movie had to be 14-years old or older. I remember that this merely added to the sense of excitement and wonder as the movie unfolded and the image of the Firefox streaking across the sky in the closing minutes became seared into my memory for years until I saw it once more - on the small screen,
Presented by the BBC's Iain Johnstone, the featurette gives us a glimpse into the work that went into the production of the movie. And includes on-camera archival interviews with Eastwood, Thomas, special effects guru John Dykstra and British actor Warren Clark who plays Pavel, the moustaches dissident who helps Eastwood's Mitchell Gant escape the KGB.
In addition to clips from FIREFOX, ANY WHICH WAY BUT LOOSE and BRONCO BILLY the full-frame documentary also features clips of Eastwood working with the crew on the night scene on the riverbank. And shots of the art department transforming the Vienna subway into the Moscow subway by the addition of Russian language posters and signs. It is here that we learn that Thomas used street maps of Moscow when writing the novel.
Eastwood recounts the horror that his direction that the special effects shots be in daylight was met with and Dykstra talks about how they ran out of location when taking background shots for the speeding Firefox. It's a credit to Dykstra's Apogee team that the effects still deliver white-knuckle excitement in the last third of the film as Gant attempts to flee the Soviet Union.
Helping to place the movie in its proper historical perspective are shots from the films Washington DC premiere, an event that was attended by a number of the members of then President Ronald Reagan's administration.
Also included on the DVD is a cast and crew listing that allows the reader to select both Clint Eastwood and writer Alex Lasker for their respective filmographies. There is also the widescreen theatrical trailer that plays up the movies action sequences that make the movie look brimming with action. I was impressed that, given the age of the picture, the trailer looks in such great shape, its crisp and the colors well balanced. Indeed the movie also appears in great shape and even though by today's standard of ultimate editions these features seem a little thin on the ground, it's still a serviceable release with an excellent transfer.
But, what of the movie itself. It is in fact everything Eastwood said it was, a broad high-style adventure, along with the elements of a tight suspense film. Eastwood plays a burnt out pilot from Vietnam, still haunted by the horrors he witnessed. Yet, given the fact that he is fluent in Russian, he is the best shot the U.S. military has in stealing the Firefox, a supersonic fighter invisible to radar that operates through mind commands that require the pilot to THINK in Russian.
So, as the movie opens we see a helicopter flying through the Alaskan wilderness, it's the American military coming to try and persuade a reluctant Gant back into the service of his country. It's not long before he's in London being prepped for the mission by Kenneth Aubry (in a remarkable and memorable performance by Freddie Jones) and being transformed into the part of an American businessman. Then its onto Moscow where he meets up with a group of dissidents intent on helping him steal the fighter.
The suspense really ratchets up in the middle of the picture to true edge-of-your-seat tension as the KGB begins to put the clues together and close in on Gant, as he (aided by Pavel) attempts to reach the hanger holding the fighter. Indeed the final flight to freedom serves as a release of all that pent up tension, as the picture transforms itself from a suspense thriller into a roller-coaster ride of adventure.
In this section the movie picks up its pace and Klaus L&ouml;witsch shines in these scenes as Gen. Vladimirov.as he attempts to second-guess the American. The sequences in this section still hold my attention today, as much as they did as an 11-year old 24 years ago.
With pre-CGI effects that still hold up remarkably well today, first-class performances from an incredible cast and tight scripting in the adaptation of an excellent novel it should be no surprise that I list FIREFOX as one of my favorite thrillers.
Hopefully a more feature laden DVD will be released in the future, but this will do for now.

2603261,4,B000GAKBLW,"Usually in these 1980's Cold War films, the Russians are portrayed as bungling, evil idiots, and the Americans are portrayed as wonderful, virtuous, absolutely perfect people.  Here in Clint Eastwood's Firefox, the Russians are portrayed as intelligent professionals who are simply trying to do their job (to prevent the Firefox from being stolen), and who do screw up.  And the Americans are portrayed as people who are just doing their jobs as well, but who also screw up.  In other words, they are HUMAN, not cartoons.  Many critics disliked this film, saying it was too slow until (SPOILER) Clint steals the plane.  This is completely wrong.  The film creates an unbearable, claustrophobic tension until the final chase sequence.  Critics these days complain about films having too many special effects in them.  Well, back in 1982, they were doing the opposite.  I think this is one of Clint's best films.  There is a featurette on the DVD, made at the time of the film's release for British TV.  It's a very subdued, interesting feature, where Clint is very business like with his observations, and it's a nice contrast to the slick ""featurettes"" you get nowadays, which are really infomercials and have the depth of an Entertainment Tonight interview.

The Soviets made great villains: when their premiers weren't snarling or shooting henchmen or trying to have Bond killed, they were pounding their shoes on UN lecterns and threatening to 'bury us'. Everywhere we were, they were in our face: Iran, Iraq, the Middle East, Vietnam, the Korean Peninsula. Hell, everywhere we *weren't*, they were in our face: Hungary, Czechoslovakia, even Afghanistan.

On the days when they weren't going to nuke us rubble, rumor was that their vast armies were ever poised to roll into West Germany with its armored divisions, supported by swarms of attack helicopters, armored personnel carriers, and of course the feared, deadly Red Army itself, storming into a helpless Western Europe under the banner of international Marxism!

They seemed implacable, evil, unstoppable.

Until one day.

One day when ""Firefox"" hit the box office. ""Firefox"", with directing and acting provided by Clint Eastwood.

""Firefox"", a straightforward little flick about a super-secret agent (Clint) called out of retirement to steal the Soviet Union's big, sleek, fast, shiny new toy, the MIG-31 superiority fighter. A flick where, fortunately, there was a lotta scenery to chew, and a lot got chewed, between Eastwood and Klaus Lowitsch (uber-baddie Soviet General Vladimirov who just *knows* something ain't right).

""Firefox"", a film so unabashedly hammy and so unreservedly tense that even in the final minutes, when it became apparent we were watching two toy MIGS imposed on stock footage having at it---well, we didn't care.

But see, ""Firefox"" has a greater claim to fame than just being a high-octane slab of Cold War cheese, with an extra helping of cheese. In 1989, after all, the Soviet Union---our great, scary, tireless foe---collapsed.

Now: some folks still say the Soviet Union was collapsing under its own weight and incompetence, that the writing was on the wall, that its feeble economy couldn't keep up with its frantic military spending. Some say Ronald ""The Gipper"" Reagan scared the bewhooskers out of those crazy old Cossacks with their giganto-hats, and made 'em spend that much faster, accelerating their demise. Some say it was Gorbachev, and glasnost, and perestroika.

Those folks are entitled to their opinions---but you look at ""Firefox""'s release date---1982---and realize that only 7 short years later, deprived of its sleek and wicked MIG-31, the Soviet Union was a shambles, a total ruin.

I think it was Clint Eastwood who did it.

2603268,4,B000GAKBLW,"What struck me about Firefox as I watched it for the first time in years was just how much there seemed to be a British influence on the script and the direction.  I had the opportunity to watch Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and Smiley's People on DVD prior to watching Firefox again, and there are a lot of similarities in style between those British TV mini-series and Firefox.

While the quality of the script for Firefox doesn't come all that close to the scripts for Tinker, Tailor or Smiley's People, it isn't all that bad, either.  The scripts for those two landmark mini-series are considered to be two of the best espionage/spy story scripts ever written.  (My only complaint about those two mini-series was the direction and editing - they were paced too slowly, although Smiley's People was better on that count.)  Firefox, in comparison, is much faster paced and (of course, this IS a Clint Eastwood movie) much more action packed - but the movie doesn't rush in letting the plot points play out.

Eastwood really stretches here as a director, going not for the action movie atmosphere, but rather more of a deliberately paced espionage movie - a bold move for an actor/director known best for his action movies (at that time).  The script might have needed a little more work, but it is more than serviceable and the story works well considering the time period when it was written.

The ending is a very exciting sequence, and it is well handled with great special effects (for the time).  It is the payoff that action movie fans will love.

Given the right expectations, Firefox is a very enjoyable movie to watch.  More than it is usually given credit for.",1120348800,,1671,4.707903780068729
2603269,3,B000GAKBLW,"Although the idea of the novel, and later the movie, came from an actual event that occurred in 1976 when Lt. Viktor Belenko defected from a base in the Soviet Far East to Japan in a, then, secret MiG-25 Foxbat (I read a book about it called ""MiG Pilot"" written by John Baron), one would have to guess that the name ""Firefox"" came from the name ""Foxbat"".

There was plenty of good action with some humor in it, but I find some portions of the film unrealistic. Though I have never been to Russia or back when it was called the ""Soviet Union"", I could tell that there was so much stereotyping of Russian officials where one would constantly ""ask for papers"" and it seems that everyone would get asked for papers by some KGB official - even if the one being ""asked"" is on the ""john"" in the men's room (which looked too clean, by the way!!!) and one official got killed by Mitchell Gant (Clint Eastwood) after telling him that his ""papers were not in order"".

The plane - a MiG-31 Firefox - looked like a craft that could have come from a sci-fi movie like ""Star Wars"" or ""Star Trek"".  The First Secretary looked like someone who could ""croak"" at any minute just like the old hard-liners did back in the early 1980s beginning with Brezhnev and some of the other old ""Bolsheviks"" that followed who were beyond ""expiration"" prior to Gorbachev's rise to power that led to the fall of the Soviet Union itself nine years after the movie was released.

As a Cold War veteran myself, serving overseas in England at the time of its release, I was in my early twenties and for someone at that age the entire movie would be exciting to watch, and I had watched it several times. I was led to believe, ""Did they really do that to people regardless if they're Russian or not minding their own business as they were  walking the streets of Moscow?"" or ""Were the hotel rooms overlooking Red Square with the honor guards of the Red Army marching in full view that big and immaculate?"" I later believed that the film and the book went a little overboard as I got older. Moscow, in a way, looked like as if it were a city in the West and not like it actually was back then.

I had to laugh at one portion of the film, and that was the Russian immigration official Gant encounters at the airport after he arrives in Moscow who tries to act really tough, ""Are you threatening me?"" This was rather silly.

Good movie, but some bad acting!!!",1118707200,,2417,4.369710467706013
2603270,3,B000GAKBLW,"Clint Eastwood has starred in a variety of roles over his career.  The character we are most familiar with is macho and self-assured.  Occasionally Clint has taken on unusual roles, such as disc jockey, singer and photographer.  While this movie would appear to be made for a typical Clint Eastwood role, the conflicted character with mental problems that Clint plays is one of his most unusual roles; a role that Clint struggles to pull off.

Clint plays Mitchell Gant, an Air Force pilot who suffered a terrible experience in Viet Nam after his capture by the North Vietnamese.  Visions of that incident continue to haunt Mitchell whenever he is in highly stressful situations.  Mitchell is also the best pilot in the world, and is extremely familiar with Soviet military aircraft and tactics.  Thus, he is a potentially ideal choice to travel to the Soviet Union and steal the super secret Mig-31, also known as Firefox.

Mitchell is enticed into taking on this mission by a combination of appealing to his abilities and suggesting that the land he is living on might be made available to him permanently.  Mitchell is quickly placed into training for the mission.  For the next hour and a half you get the impression that Mitchell is not in control of his life, either physically or mentally.  Physically he barely understands what is happening around him as people move him from one place to another.  Mentally he continues to have flashbacks and fugues that distract him.

The best part of the movie begins with Mitchell's entry onto the Soviet base where the only two prototype Mig-31's exist.  Clint Eastwood finally gets to play the macho character for which he is known, with the exception of one lapse in the shower.  The best scene in the movie, in my opinion, is when Mitchell steals the Mig-31 from its hangar.  I have never seen anyone start a military aircraft as quickly as Mitchell starts the Mig-31.

The final portion of the movie is a cat and mouse game between Mitchell and the Air Force and Navy of the Soviet Union.  Mitchell does his best to trick the Soviets into thinking he is going somewhere other than his intended destination.  He must also use his limited fuel to reach a refueling station.  Otherwise he will run out of fuel and crash into the sea.  To add some spice to the movie is the second Firefox prototype, which is quickly loaded with weapons and sent to chase Mitchell down.

This movie suffers from a number of problems.  The most significant problem is that the flashbacks Mitchell has are more distracting than illuminating, and quickly become annoying.  The flashbacks added little to the plot and just as little to our understanding of Clint's character.

Another, nearly as serious, problem is the stock footage of aircraft used early in the movie.  We see an aircraft mysteriously change between an F-5, an F-4 Phantom and an F-105 Thunderchief (I think those were the transitions).  Though such transitions are common on television shows, a military advisor should have been available to correct this basic error for a movie.

Another problem is the dated special effects.  The Firefox mockup is reasonably good, but once the Firefox is in flight it generally lacks reality.  This movie was made in 1982, after the incredible special effects developed for a famous series of science fantasy movies, and better special effects were possible.

Another problem with this movie is the pacing.  For most of the first three-fourths of the movie the movie just plods along, with only brief moments of action.

Strangely, with as many problems as this movie has, I like it.  It has enough entertainment value that I keep watching it.  However, I struggle recommending this movie to anyone but a hardcore Clint Eastwood fan or someone who likes cold war spy movies, even mediocre ones.",1117584000,,3826,4.851851851851852
2603271,3,B000GAKBLW,"Now this movie is one of he most ridiculous films about USSR I ever seen. Most russians (like me) could die from laughter while watching that one. The scenes in Soviet Union are simply hilarious. The uniforms look like WW2 British Army, the cars are mostly from the 60's (why the hell KGB agents would drive a black governments Chaika from the 60's?), the metro looks nothing like the truth plus it has a great hotel-style mensroom! I mean we moscovites are proud of our metro but this is too much. USSR looks like some stupid Evil Emprire out of Star Wars with a nice mix of Nazi Germany with KGB men asking for ""papers"" each 5 minutes. The funniest thing is Clint  never even cared about the actual russian translation  - bumaga is russian means just paper not documents!  All russian language used in the film (both spoken and written) is so bad that I could not understand a word. I guess real Gant would last 3 minutes with such a language not to mention the whole story of him getting in the plane is so unbelievable that I guess KGB was pretty much insulted by the way they were portrayed in the film! Now don't get me wrong I'm not a communist, but the political reality of the early 80's USSR was ... to say politely VERY different from that Nazi/Stalinist regime in the movie. Imprisoned jewish scientists - gimme a break! From one side it's histericaly funny, from the other - a bit frightening that americans back then really believed in that Evil Empire George Lucasy stereotypes.",1116547200,,1493,4.522222222222222

Clint Easwood plays a troubled Vietnam Era veteran suffering from flashbacks (I hate that cliche) who speaks fluent Russian and is an experienced fighter pilot.  He is pulled from retirement to steal the FIREFOX, a top secret Russian fighter plane that is more advanced than anything in NATO's arsenal.

The action sequences are a bit dated, but the plane is definitely cool.  For the most part, they used good props.  Makarov pistols and AK-47's are the standard weapons.  At least they got that part right.

2603274,3,B000GAKBLW,"This was Clint Eastwood's second dip into the waters of the espionage thriller (the first was the awful ""Eiger Sanction"" back in 1975), and one of the few films he directed which relies heavily on visual effects. As a director, Eastwood seems uneasy with both modes, which go against the grain of his realistic, tough, and often stoic & silent directorial style. Nonetheless, ""Firefox"" works better than it should. Eastwood brings understated realism to what might have been a hopelessly hokey Cold War techno thriller, and the visual effects-laden last third is fairly exciting. However, the mixture of elements ultimately produces only an adequate film, a strange entry in Eastwood's long string of hits.
The plot is a Tom Clancy story before there were Tom Clancy stories (this is based on a novel by Craig Thomas). The Soviets (remember them?) have developed a super fighter jet, the Firefox, with thought-controlled weapons system. The Firefox threatens the balance of power in the Cold War, so NATO needs to get their hands on it, pronto. The only man who can do it is pilot Mitchell Gant (Eastwood). He speaks fluent Russian, can infiltrate the base with the help of Russian Jewish dissenters (played by Ronald Lacey, Nigel Hawthorne, and Warren Clarke), and has the skill to fly the Firefox. Only problem: Gant is highly unstable from his Vietnam experience, is prone is nasty flashbacks (a problem if you're flying a though- controlled plane!), and has done no undercover work before.
""Firefox"" is overlong at 136 minutes, and tends to drag with far too many scenes of Russian and NATO boardroom arguments. The film works best in the early parts during the scenes with Lacey, Hawthorne, and Clarke, who all give fine, sentimental performances as double agents who know they are doomed but struggle on for what they know is right. In a few place, Eastwood shows traces of the later themes of the consequences of violence that would mature in ""Unforgiven"" and ""Mystic River."" Eastwood himself is fairly good in the role, avoiding any ""Dirty Harry"" clichs or relying too much on his tough guy image, but he does look rather silly in his undercover disguise scenes.
Nonetheless, it does seem to take forever until the last third, where the Firefox tries to blaze an almost hopeless escape trail out of the Soviet Union, with another Firefox prototype on its tail. The effects (by John Dysktra of ""Star Wars"" fame) are zippy and fantastic, but any human element left in the film pretty much bails out at this point. Enjoy the planes, enjoy the speed, enjoy Clint just staring out the window and not moving much. It's fairly exciting, but when it's all over, you'll feel a bit let down.
The DVD, like most Warner Bros. discs in the Clint Eastwood Collection, looks very good, and the sound is 5.1. But also like most Warner Bros. discs in the Clint Eastwood Collection, there are no extras.",1077840000,,2893,4.8582995951417
2603275,3,B000GAKBLW,"FIREFOX is one of those films made back when the U.S.S.R. still existed, and espionage is the key here. Clint Eastwood plays Mitchell Gant, a retired Air Force pilot who is resurrected to steal the FIREFOX fighter jet from Russia. Based on a novel by the same name, FIREFOX certainly looks like an interesting movie, and it is to some extent. It has a little James Bond flavor in it too. It is not great, however, and has many flaws.
Eastwood constantly changes deguise throughout the film as his allies seek to get him to the jet. The process is long and confusing, and the whole time Clint doesn't look like he has any idea what he is doing. Once he grabs the jet itself, and pulls out of the hanger, night suddenly changes to day! The special effects during the flying sequences are exciting. John Dykstra, who won an oscar for the special effects in STAR WARS, did the job on the effects here and the results are impressive, even though they look dated. The movie does drag, however, when the U.S.S.R. intellegence constantly is trying to figure out which direction he is headed. The worst thing about this film is the ending. After winning a dramatic dogfight with the other FIREFOX, the movie ends right there in the sky. It would have been interesting if Eastwood could have entended it a little more to at least see him land the plane in his home country. This was Eastwood's eighth time as a director as well. The movie is interesting, but the minor flaws, and flat ending are what kind of hold it back from being great.

1. Why was Gant SO easily persuaded to go along with the mission. I expected at least a half hour or so of rebellion on the part of this ex-Air Force pilot. Instead, he gave in almost instantaneously.
2. Has anyone ever seen the sun come out so fast as it did after Gant pulled the plane from the hangar? Wasn't it supposed to be the middle of the night? All of a sudden, the sun was out when the plane took off. I've seen this kind of screw-up before...I remember seeing it once on the ""Adam-12"" television show....but never in a major motion picture.

2603278,5,B000GAKBLW,"Directing and starring in this classic spy thriller from the eighties is Clint Eastwood, more generally known as the gruff ""Man With No Name"" in several spaghetti westerns and American westerns of his own direction.  In ""FireFox,"" Eastwood takes on a more modern and quite different role for himself, playing a former Air Force pilot who is still suffering from some rather horrific personal demons.  In the genre of spy/thriller films, Eastwood's name comes to the top in this classic that is arguably one of the best!  Although the pacing of this film is slightly off, I believe that to be intentional and it adds to the suspense that is inherent to the plot and a sure sign of skill on the director's part.
The premise:
Clint Eastwood plays former Air Force pilot Mitchell Gant who was shot down over Viet Nam and captured.  The American and British governments have learned of a new Soviet fighter plane that will ultimately tip the scales of balance to the hand of the Soviets and decide to steal the plane with the help of the Russian Jews who have been forced to design and build it.  Given Gant's heritage, a Russian mother who taught him the language and the necessity of being able to speak Russian, the American government calls him back into service.
What follows from there is an extraordinarily intriguing and suspenseful plot that compels the viewer through the story as we see Gant make his way into the Soviet Union and on his way to the airbase in which he must infiltrate and steal this ultimate weapon of war.  Of particular note is how well the characterizations of the Russians were played out and believable.  I've never been to Russia and I don't pretend to know how things were there during the cold war and pre-glasnost but through Eastwood's direction and the actors efforts, they quite easily bring about a ""suspension of disbelief"" in the story.
One minor ""gripe"" would be in the beginning of the movie when Gant is going through a flashback and they show him flying an F-4 Phantom and then an F-105 Thud and then roll back to the Phantom, two very distinct and different aircraft.  Simply because they both had the same camouflage scheme does not mean they're the same planes and directors ""should"" pay closer attention to these details.  While this was a minor distraction for myself, it in no way detracts from the films overall plot.
Overall, ""FireFox"" is worth every penny and I highly recommend this DVD as an honored addition to your DVD collection!  {ssintrepid}

2603279,4,B000GAKBLW,"In 1982, while the Cold War was yet raging between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, Clint Eastwood directed and starred in an exciting action film about espionage called ""Firefox"".  Clint Eastwood plays Major Mitchell Gant, a retired pilot from the U.S. Air Force who suffers from delayed psychological stress disorder from when he fought in the Vietnam War.  Being the only pilot qualified to fly Soviet Air Force jets who is also fluent in Russian, SIS agent Kenneth Aubrey (Freddie Jones) has U.S. AF pilot Capt. Arthur Buckholz (David Huffman) recruit Gant to be the primary operative in a U.S.-sponsored espionage mission.  The goal is to steal a technologically superior, top-secret prototype jet fighter that is code-named Firefox out of the Soviet Union.  Gant, of course, is not particularly interested, but returns to Washington with Capt. Buckholz.  There he is given specific training that will enable him to enter the Soviet Union unnoticed.  Once in the Soviet Union, Gant meets a Russian who works for the SIS, Pavel Upenskoy (Warren Clarke).  The Soviet scientists who reluctantly developed the thought-controlled prototype fighter are a Jewish husband and wife team, Dr. Pyotr Baranovich (Nigel Hawthorne) and Natalia (Dimitra Arliss).
The film is fraught with tension, drama and excitement as Gant makes his way to infiltrate the Soviet AF base to steal the prototype fighter.  Special effects used in the film were superb for the early 1980's, though some may regard them as being dated by today's standards.  Other memorable characters in the film include Soviet General Vladimirov (Klaus Lwitsch), the Communist Party First Secretary (Stefan Schnabel) and Soviet AF pilot Lt. Col. Voskov (Kai Wulff).
The film is not perfect, but with a superb Cold War plot, good dialog, engaging characters and good special effects, I rate ""Firefox"" with 4 out of 5 stars.  I am very happy that the film was released on DVD in widescreen format.

2603281,3,B000GAKBLW,"Back in the 1980s, Americans couldn't care less about bearded Islamic militants in the backwoods of Afghanistan.  Our big concern was the big, bad Soviet Union.  Even though we were the most powerful country in the world by a large margin, we feared war and invasion (World War III, Red Dawn, Amerika), espionage (virtually every Bond film from the period), and annhiliation (The Day After, WarGames) at the hands of the U.S.S.R.
Firefox fits neatly into this us-versus-them thriller, with iconic American loner/tough-guy hero Clint Eastwood penetrating into the Soviet Union to steal the world's most advanced aircraft, which was invisible to radar and America's defenses.  The movie had the potential to be a spectacular spy/action thriller, but the results are something of a mixed bag.
When I watched this film as a child, I was impressed by the seeming omnipresence of the KGB.  It was creepy to think that people lived in a society where no one trusted anyone and any loose words could mean certain death.  In retrospect, the portrayal of the KGB is somewhat cartoonish.  Perhaps most laughable was when Eastwood was asked for ""your papers, please"" while taking a shower.
Another aspect of the film that seems somewhat dated is the highly propogandistic way in which the dissidents were portrayed.  Several of Eastwood's helpers in the Soviet Union risked death by transporting him or giving him secret information, yet they seemed flippant, almost casual about their impending doom, as if being found out and killed by the KGB was just a normal, expected part of the plans.  ""Oh, don't worry about me,"" they would say in a dismissive tone, explaining that without the freedoms that Eastwood took for granted back in the West, life just wasn't worth living.  While history is full of people giving their lives for freedom, the shallow way in which these characters faced their fates could be chalked up to either poor scriptwriting, shallow Cold War propaganda, or a bit of both.
A couple other criticisms.  The dialogue is rather flat and the storyline is somewhat predictable.  Eastwood's character remains elusive (one-dimensional?) and stoic (wooden?) throughout the movie.  I don't want to criticize the special effects for the flying scenes, though, because they were considered top-notch at the time.  Publicity made much of the Star Wars legacy of some of the special effects personnel.
In the end, what we have is something of a cartoonish spy-thriller that entrances starry-eyed children into the epic struggle between East and West, but feels more like a Cold War cops-and-robbers flick for more mature audiences.",1044576000,,2630,5.102564102564102

saw in Star Wars and thought he could a blend of Sci-Fi-James Bond in 2 hours with Eastwood looking like a total fool in array of disguises. It was a real dissapoinment To see a true acting
legend succumb to his own shamefull descions. The real problem
with the film is that it was way overlong and streching the

2603288,5,B000GAKBLW,"I've always loved this movie.  I think it's a great movie.  It's always been entertaining, and you really have to rate it according to when it was made (the early 80's).
But I have to say one thing:  What ever happened to just sitting down and allowing yourself to be entertained?  There are so many people who feel they need to psycho-analyze every little thing about a flick.  If everything was so real, it wouldn't make much of a movie.  And please don't listen to Leonard Maltin (as if anything this critic had to say had any value).  I say, just sit down, shutup, and relax.  This is classic Eastwood, and fun to watch.  (Note to Leonard Maltin:  Stuff it.  No one's interested in your dribble).",1007164800,,700,4.476190476190476
2603289,4,B000GAKBLW,"What's so amazing is the insight and forward thinking that went into this film. Yes the first portion of the film is slow, but so is about 99% of espionage and air combat. I've said it before and I'll say it again: When Hollywood actually shows this stuff realistically, the audience gets bored or sleepy because they do not appreciate authenticity. Back to the insightfulness... Well, over here on the Nellis Test Range, and yes I'm specifically talking about Area 51, they fly very special ""aggressor"" squadrons that use actual Soviet aircraft. Guess where they got them. Some were defected and some...drum roll...were stolen with the help of U.S. clandestine services. Furthermore, information on U.S. stealth programs was not public when Firefox was made. A Russian scientist is actually the guy who developed the equations that predicted ""low observability"", and his government spent a while looking into the concept, though not until recently very seriously. The Russians also had a weird preoccupation with the paranormal, telekinesis, and, yes, biofeedback. These uncanny pseudo-recreations in Firefox, combined with the believable depiction of the closed nature of Soviet society and their ""secret bases"" where R&D took place makes for a sci-fi/spy film with an air of authenticity, in spite of its fictional traits. I also like the great repertoire between Gant and the Sub captain. It strikes me as being very true to life with its representation of automatic camaraderie and unspoken understanding between the two characters. I look forward to this film's release on DVD.",995587200,,1583,5.260869565217392
2603290,4,B000GAKBLW,"Okay, let me start by saying that I do really like this film, but not in ways you think. As an ""Eastwood"" I think its one of his worse. But, I think Clint, when he read the book, fell in love with the best part of it...the fighter scenes! When I saw this thing WAAAY back in '82, I really enjoyed it. What did I know..I was a kid!! The film to me know looks really weird, especially the performances of the Russians.  The script made the Soviet Union like it was Nazi, Germany (Whoa! Don't get me wrong, I know the USSR was not a fun place to live during that period); after awhile expected the military characters to raise their arms in a Heil Hitler salute. Most of them were performed by German character actors! The actor who steals it for me is the one who played General Vladimirov, he's so icy--but he does crack and curse out the 1st secretary. Great scene. The first 90 minutes will kill you--just faast forward to the last hour, the scenes with firefox 1 and 2 flying over the polar icecap is breathtaking. Clint's ""in-the-cockpit"" shot are very realistic, he really did his homework on that one. Everything said and done, Firefox is worth a look if you're a diehard Clint fan or even a John Dykstra one. Also Maurice Jarre music is fun filled (sometimes a little too close to Grand Prix for my tastes). Enjoy!",992044800,,1320,4.365853658536586
2603291,3,B000GAKBLW,"I loved ""Firefox"" the novel and the sequels which return the great charachter of Mitchell Gant.  Unfortunately, Gant's charachter (and Thomas' writing) doesn't transfer well to film.  In ""Firefox"" Gant has been plucked by the CIA out of retirment after suffering physical and emotional scarring in Vietnam.  (Readers from the novel will remember that Gant had been plucked out earlier to fly captured Russian warplanes in mock combat, but the film streamlines the details).  When the Russian Air Force develops a super-advanced fighter plane that is a) invisible to radar; b) capable of mach-5+ speeds; c) armed with a thougt-controlled fire-control system and d) way ahead of anything available in the west, the CIA and British SIS collude on a foolhardy and almost plan to send Gant into Russia to steal it.  With the help of Jewish dissidents and the virtually imprisoned scientists working on the plane, Gant breaks into the Russians' high-security test site in a mad rush to steal the plane.  Like the novel, the film is split into two parts - getting to the Firefox and then getting it to the west.  The second half - dominated by pre-CGI special effects - seems pretty weak, although knowing how cartoonish CGI can be, I've learned to appreciate it.  The first half - in which Gant steals his way through the nightmare of the police-state of Russia - is very slow, and probably of little interest if you didn't read the book.  ""Firefox"" (both book and film) excel though because they don't try to follow your typical technothriller routine - steely eyed heroes and all.  When confronted by a bullying KGB agent in a subway, and informed that his papers aren't in order, Gant kills the man.  For your stock secret agent, this would be a moment of pluck and quick thinking, but for Gant, it's a moment of outrageous stupidity: the KGB man was reaching, not for his gun (or a wallet) but for his cigarettes.  (""Ofcourse your papers aren't in order!"", Gant is roundly drubbed by his Russian co-conspirator, ""nobody's papers are in order, this is Moscow!!"").  Every aspect of the plan goes awry, although that was clearly in the minds of the planners who, knowing the odds, thought they'd be sweetining their chances if they made included self-destruction at every juncture.  It's a thrill ride, and made during the darker days of the cold war (Reagan's 2nd year, the USSR ruled by a sucession of dying old men) and populated by almost bloodless charachters, the movie at times looks like a documentary.  The meat of the book doesn't really translate well because, like most of Thomas' books, the prose are based on high speed pulses of self-loathing and second guessing running through the minds of the central charachters' minds, and that doesn't make for scintilating dialog (or any dialog, really).  It's like those superhero cartoons when Superman must actually orate all those things that, in comic books) stay in thought baloons.  The film makers are game though, especially Eastwood who makes the Mitchell Gant charachter his own (I can't read any of the Mitchell Gant novels like ""Firefox Down"" or ""Winterhawk"" and substitute a more appealing visage for Gqant's scarred one).  The film also has Kenneth Colley as the ill-fated Col. Kontarsky, the man responsible for securing the super-plane that Gant steals.  Star Wars fans will remember him by site as the similarly bad-lucked Admiral Piett, the guy who keeps losing the Millenium Falcon thruought ""Empire Strikes Back"" (which came out 2 years earlier).  The way he looks, you'd think Yuri Andropov would materialize out of nowhere and zap the dark-side at him.",985478400,,3625,4.940691927512356

2603300,4,B000GAKBLW,"Though my opinion of Clint Eastwood has lowered with the revelations in Sondra Locke's book, there is no disputing his abilities as an actor and director.  One of his finest efforts comes in Firefox, Eastwood's taut,  exciting adaptation of Craig Thomas' 1975 novel.
Eastwood plays Mitchell  Gant, a burned-out Air Force Vietnam vet who is first seen jogging in the  Alaskan wilderness.  Gant occassionally suffers from bouts of Delayed  Stress Syndrome - shown when, as an Air Force helicopter approaches his log  cabin home, he flashes back to a harrowing experience of being shot down,  captured by Communist soldiers, and being rescued.
Mitchell Gant's battle  shock, though, is of little concern to the CIA and British MI6, for they  want him for the most audacious intelligence mission yet.  The titular  Firefox is a Soviet superplane, capable of Mach Six, invisible to radar  tracking, and possessing thought-controlled weaponry.  Mitchell Gant's job  - steal it.
But to get to it he must be infiltrated into Russia and  ferried from Moscow to a Red airbase in the Urals, Bilyarsk.  The first  half of the film takes up the painstaking task by NATO's Russian contacts  to infiltrate Gant to Bilyarsk and the efforts of the KGB detatchment  assigned to Firefox security to figure out their plan and stop them.
Along the way Eastwood extracts quality performances from the huge cast  assembled, notably from Kenneth Colley (Admiral Piett in the Star Wars  films) as KGB Colonel Kontarsky.  There is some excellent interplay between  Gant and the various Russians willing to die to betray the country that has  destroyed their lives, most notably when the Firefox project head, Dr.  Baranovich, explains why he doesn't resent ""the men in London who are  ordering me to die"" to a thoroughly puzzled Gant.
The second half of  the film involves a dazzling aerial chase as Gant pilots the Firefox  through the world's largest, most powerful air defense.  The SFX work is  excellent as John Dyxstra (from Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, and the  later Batman films) uses ultra-high-speed aerial footage to present a  splendid view of Mach Two-plus speeds.  Gant encounters missiles and  eventually a second Firefox (piloted by Kai Wulff as the project's test  pilot Yuri Voskov).  The ensuing chase is among the finest in film, from  thousands of feet in the sky to mere hundreds of feet from the ground.  My  favorite part is the admittedly implausible chase through a narrow Arctic  canyon at Mach Two or more - yeah, it can't be done by jet fighters in real  life, but it's still too good to pass up.
In all, Firefox remains a  classic of the spy and sci-fi genres.",944006400,,2669,4.9434389140271495
2603301,4,B000GAKBLW,"Though my opinion of Clint Eastwood has dropped with the revelations in Sondra Locke's book, there is no disputing his ability in movies.  Firefox is a change of pace for Eastwood, an espionage drama that dabbles in scifi  and includes superior aerial SFX.
Based on Craig Thomas' novel, Eastwood  stars and directs, handling both chores very well.  Mitchell Gant  (Eastwood) is a burned-out Vietnam-era fighter pilot suffering from  lingering battle shock (his experience as a POW is portrayed in  a  harrowing flashback sequence of being shot down, captured, and rescued).  He is ""recruited"" by NATO to be infiltrated into Soviet Russia  and steal the ultimate fighter plane - the Firefox, a stealth fighter  capable of Mach Six speeds and possessing thought-controlled weaponry.
The first half of the film is the laborous attempt by the CIA and MI6's  native recruits to smuggle Gant to Bilyarsk, the Red airbase in the  southern Urals where the Firefox is housed.  Leonard Maltin's criticism of  the film as slow-paced is flat out wrong, for the infiltration of Gant  through Russia is quite good and involves some excellent interplay between  Gant and the various Russians willing to die to betray the country that has  destroyed their lives.
The second half of the film is a dazzling aerial  chase and great ground-level cat-and-mouse game as the Russians try to  intercept a plane that is three times faster than anything else, can attack  targets some three seconds faster than any defense system, and is  exceedingly difficult to track.  The flying scenes are awe-inspiring even  today; SFX honcho John Dyxstra uses vastly-speeded-up aerial footage to  convey a tremendously effective view of speed amid the nicely intimidating  model of the Firefox craft.
The lengthy finale involves Gant's duel with  a second Firefox prototype, one of the best chase sequences ever filmed, a  chase that's even better than similar aerial chases in the Star Wars or  Superman films.  The best part is the admittedly implausible chase through  a narrow Arctic Circle canyon at Mach Two-plus speeds; yeah, it can't be  done by jet fighters in real life, but it is a thriller nonetheless.
