5836343,5,B00DNLZNLO,"I love Hallmark and Lifetime movies at Christmas!!  They are not my favorites, but I enjoy every movie!!  I watch them all year!!",1389744000,,129,4.565217391304348
5836344,5,B00DNLZNLO,I have not watched the other 3 movies on this DVD.  I simply bought it for the Christmas in Boston movie.  I kept this movie in my DVR for like 3 years and now I can delete it since I have it on DVD.  The 4 pack was a good value - I would have paid the price I paid for just the one movie but I now I have three more to watch and I might discover that I like them too!,1389312000,,368,3.4096385542168677
5836345,5,B00DNLZNLO,"Received this set very fast and had no problems with the dvds. They seem to be for maybe younger audiences but I think they are a great set to watch at any age group, will love watching them every year around Christmas. I would recommend this.",1389225600,,243,4.304347826086956
5836346,5,B00DNLZNLO,"This collection contains some fun holiday movies that. I watch every year! They are light and romantic and appropriate for the whole family to watch. They aren't exactly my husband's favorite, but then again, what chick flick is? I highly recommend!",1387843200,5,249,5.097560975609756
5836347,3,B00DNLZNLO,I thought this was 4 different dvds and was going to give as 4 gifts. So I was disappointed when it arrived.  Maybe my fault but the description was deceiving. I did not watch this but gave as one gift.,1387756800,,202,4.05
5836357,5,B00DNLZNLO,Good movies!,1484265600,,12,5.5
5836358,5,B00DNLZNLO,"This is a great 4-pk of family-friendly Christmas movies.  They're cute movies, and we no longer have cable, so they're a great addition to our collection of movies for the season.",1483488000,,180,4.806451612903226
5836359,5,B00DNLZNLO,loved it,1483401600,,8,3.5
5836360,2,B00DNLZNLO,"Cheap copy full of ads. Only two speaker sound. No surround sound. All disks have long commercials by Gaiam, some yoga company. I paid for movies. If I wanted commercials, I'd watch these on TV.",1482710400,4,194,4.571428571428571
5836361,2,B00DNLZNLO,None of the ABC Family Movies are sold with subtitles. Deaf and hard of hearing buyers beware. Really cute movies but you can only view them by watching when they are shown on network TV each year. Too bad too.,1482192000,,210,4.275
5836362,5,B00DNLZNLO,I truly enjoyed these movies & DVD was in perfect shape,1481500800,,55,4.090909090909091

5836365,5,B00DNLZNLO,"These were one of wife's anniversary presents. She loves Christmas Movies, especially Hallmark, so she was very happy. I give this seller 2 thumbs up and a 11 out of 10.",1478044800,,169,4.483870967741935
5836366,1,B00DNLZNLO,Was messed up when i got them,1476662400,,29,3.2857142857142856
5836367,5,B00DNLZNLO,"The main reason that I bought this DVD collection is for the movie Holiday in Handcuffs. I absolutely adore this movie. It is super funny and just like a lighthearted film for the holidays. I think it is super romantic, even though it is highly unlikely in real life (and also kind of creepy if it were to happen, but let's ignore logic for now). I haven't seen all the other movies, but just for one, the price is already right. I think of the other movies as just a bonus, so even if I don't like them, the price is right. I didn't have any issues with shipping.",1467590400,4,564,4.18348623853211
5836368,4,B00DNLZNLO,Bought this DVD for Jenny McCarthy. The movies are your average fair.,1467158400,,69,4.833333333333333

5836375,4,B00DNLZNLO,Well worth the money to get 4 family safe holiday movies. Holiday in handcuffs was great and the others were pretty good as well.,1455494400,,129,4.416666666666667

5836388,3,B00DNLZNLO,The movies are great and a fun collection. But unfortunately one of my movies didn't play at all. The CD's were very scratched and all four of them skipped.,1451174400,,156,4.413793103448276
5836389,1,B00DNLZNLO,I received the wrong item.,1448928000,,26,4.4
5836390,3,B00DNLZNLO,"Included in this set are 2 movies I enjoy at Christmas. Holiday In Handcuffs has always been one of my favorites as has Santa Baby 2. Christmas In Boston is an ok movie but not a fave and I really didn't care for Christmas Cupid. Having said that, the price is good for the movies you'll receive.",1422748800,,296,4.2105263157894735

5836394,3,B00DNLZNLO,"I have only seen two of these movies, however I would say to call them for the ""family"" is relative in my opinion because not all of the behavior in the movies is family friendly. one of the movies shows women in revealing clothing, another has language and people ""coming out"". that might be fine for some families, but not mine. I prefer clean, for all ages Christmas movies, even if they are supposed to be ""romantic"". as far as the other two go, I cannot say because I haven't seen them. just wanted to let others know so they aren't surprised by what they buy.",1414195200,2,565,4.339622641509434
5836395,4,B00DNLZNLO,"I originally found this because I was looking to get Christmas Cupid, however it was cheaper to get this  pack of movies than that one individually. I was pleasantly surprised by these ABC Christmas movies.",1408060800,,206,4.885714285714286
5836396,5,B00DNLZNLO,Love these movies. Christmas romance is one of my favorites.  Reminds me of watching movies with my daughter.  Try it.,1392595200,3,118,4.85
