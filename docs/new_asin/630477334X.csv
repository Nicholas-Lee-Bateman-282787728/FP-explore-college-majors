924979,5,630477334X,"The Red Headed Stranger (RHS), starring Willie Nelson, was superb, and a big hit with me when I first saw it. I tried to buy it, but could only find it on VHS, which I could not play. However, I did buy the CD album, which was also superb. On this album Nelson tells the story of a minister, call it  ""The Ballad of Julian  Shay"", which may be the greatest western CD of all times.
 Now I catch the movie every chance I get. It is very complex - a love story, a tragedy, a regression into hell, then recovery, a second love story and finally a cleaning up on a mean and vicious family. There are many side-stories woven in. I'll try to share this story as best as I caught it, and also tie it into the songs on the album.

 His first love. The movie starts with a wedding scene in Philadelphia. The bride (Raysha, by Morgan Fairchild) is a beauty, and part of the east coast establishment. She glances at a picture of the man who came in second, before she exits the church and sees the wedding gift from her husband, a beautiful pony, a dancin' bay pony.
Track 1: Time of the Preacher.
 The next scene shows Julian and Raysha on a two horse stagecoach, with the pony tied on behind. As they approach Driscoll, MT, after a long and hot trip, they spot a creek, where Raysha decides a bath is in order. Enter the five grown sons of Larn Claver. This could have been a very ugly scene, but Julian was able to finesse the situation with the aid of a hidden rifle.
 In Discroll they discover that the only water is from the Clavers; an old well is there, but dry; very few attend his first church service and many mock it; and the sheriff is a man by the name of Reese Scoby, friendly, but inclined to leave things alone. At supper, Raysha asks: Julian, why did you bring me here?
 Next, Julian starts to deepen the well. He works all day, but no one comes to help. Raysha asks: Why are you doing this to me? However, the next day he is back in the well. The Claver clan rides in and pile dirt and stones on top of him. Larn Claver tells his youngest son, Odie, to keep watch as the other Clavers move out to tend their wolf traps. Scoby comes along, helps Julian recover. He shows them he is down to mud. Scoby and a townsman, Cauley Felps, decide to help and they get down to water. [During this time a messenger comes along, happens to stop at the home of the Yellow-Haired Lady (LHL) (Cindy, by Marinell Madden). He has a message for Mrs Shay only. Cindy and her father agree to deliver it. But they open it, finds out that Raysha is going to leave Julian.]
 The Clavers return and Odie tells them that they have found water. The Clavers ride to the well and starts to burn the well structure, but Cauley Felps comes out with rifle and aims at the elder Claver. Claver orders Odie to shoot Cauley and he does. This requires Scoby to lock him up. The next day the town opts to go ahead with the hanging, and puts Odie on a horse. Cindy pleads with the minister: ""I love him, I don't want to lose him."" You can do something to stop this. However, the old man in his rage in-advertently startles the horse and his son is hanged. Julian starts to say a prayer for Odie, but Cindy screams don't prey for him now. She also tell him his wife is leaving him. Julian rushes home to find that both Raysha and the pony are gone.
Track 2: I Couldn't Believe It Was True.

He loved her so dearly, he went out of his mind.
 The town people complete the well and the windmill. They all come to the church for a dedication, but Julian is not there. All he can sense is that ""she has gone."" Scoby pleads for him ""to say a few words"",  but instead he steals Scoby's horse, which becomes ""The Ragin' Black Stallion.""
Track 3: Time of the Preacher Theme.

A regression into hell
 Julian leaves Driscoll. He goes crazy as he wanders around Montana, and comes into Blue Rock, MT. He spots his wife with her old boyfriend, and shoots them. He now rips off his collar, ties the pony to the Ragin' Black Stallion (RBS) and leaves Blue Rock
 Meantine, back in Driscoll the Clavers learn of the killings by Julian. They drive towards the well intent on finishing it off, once and for all. They drive off the towns people, and ultimately shoot Scoby, as the water tank empties over his body. He is not dead, but the people no longr see him as able to deal with the Clavers. They give him a $20 purse and asks him to ""ride on out of here.""
 For Julian the wandering continues.
""The Red Headed Stranger, from Blue Rock, Montana Rode into town one day.""
""Don't cross him, don't boss him. He's wild in his sorrow.
""He's ridin' and hidin' his pain.""
Track 4: Medley - Blue Rock Montana/Red Headed Stranger.

The RHS meets up with the YHL
 The RHS had ""eyes like thunder"" as he rides into another town. He enters the saloon, gambling hall, etc. As he sits with a drink, the ""YHL came down the stairs to the tavern and looks up the stranger there. Asks him: ""got no esires?"" ""Buy me a drink?"" Then she recognizes him. ""Lo preacher. Not so high and mighty now."" He bought her a drink and gave her some money - - ."" She followed him out as he saddled the stallion. ""You owe me more than a coin preacher."" He shot her so quick, she never heard anyone say: ""Don't cross him, don't boss him, he's wild in his sorrow."" There were several shots at this time and I believe two desperados, possibly in cohoots with the YHL, took off with the pony.
""The YHL was buried at sunset; the stranger went free of course.
""For you can't hang a man for killin' a woman who's trying to steal his horse.""
He rides on, but now, but without the pony.

His Second Love - Prologue
 Next is a scene of a lady and her son and a Chinese helper working a farm. The lady (Laurie, by Katharine Ross) and her son, Nathan, are approached by the two desperados leading the pony. Julian can be seen in the background, apparently following them, to retrieve the pony. The desperados are looking for water and whatever else they can get. The first desperado, asks if she favors them now, and if so, who goes first. She indicates he is the one, and as he steps forward she strikes him in the face with her broom, and pushes him down. The second desperado is about to kill Laurie, when Julian shoots him. She then grabs a rifle from inside her house, and the Chinese runs from the field to help. The first desperado then cuts down the Chinaman and Julian then cuts him down in turn. Laurie and Nathan run to see if they can save the Chinaman. Julian rides in, picks up the pony, then also rides to the others. Laurie, in her anger and rage, shouts: ""Didn't hear me calling for your help. You've got your horse now, so git."" Julian moves out, sets up camp and builds a fire. Then he has a flash back to his marriage, and all the good times with his first love.
Track 5: Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain.
Track 6 - 9 and 11 Seem to repeat all that has been said above.

His Second Love - Blossoms
 The next morning opens with Julian taking over the role of the China man, plowing along.  Laurie and Nathan take a pail of water out to him, as her anger has gone. Julian continues to plow in the distance. Scobe rides in, asks Laurie if she has seen any stranger ride by. She answers no and asks what did he do. Scobe responds: ""he used to be a preacher, until he took up killin."" ""He killed his own wife.""
 The next day, Julian intercepts Scoby, and Scoby shoots him, in his own rage, and kicks him down the bank, and into the creek. However, he is not dead, and Laurie and Nathan rescue him. They bandage his wound, let him rest, feed him, and gradually nurse him back to health. She asks many questions about his pastsuch as: Did you mean to kill her? ""I did then.""
 Their relationship grows. He asks about Nathan's father. I ran him off, all he wanted to do was sit in the shade. Julian asks: ""Is that a warning."" Her answer: ""You've already done more on this place than he ever did. She asks: ""What made you start plowing."" His answer: Gone about as far as I could the other way.""
 The next scene shows Laurie cutting his hair,and trimming his beard, with a hint of tenderness creeping in. This is followed by seeing her in her bed and Julian singing:
""Can I sleep in your arms, tonight, Lady?
""Its so cold lying here all alone.
""An' I have no hold to hold on you.
""An' I assure you I'll do you no wrong.""
And she slowly turns down the quilts and opens her bed to him.
Track 12: Can I Sleep In Your Arms?
 In the next scene Julian and Nathan take the wagon and two old horses into the nearby town for supplies. Julian has his arm around Nathan and essentially treats him as his son. Nathan asks him if he could ride the pony. And the answer is no. He also asks Julian if he likes his mother. Julian responds that you're asking a lot of questions. Well do you? And Julian, after hedging a bit, responds yes. Nathan, with a big smile on his face said: ""I knew it.""
In town they pass a saloon and discover Scoby in it where he is striving to commit suicide by forcing a local farmer to kill him. It doesn't work, and Julian explains that he maybe is drunk and a bit crazy.
 Later that day, Laurie asks him: We're alright aren't we? And later she tells Nathan that maybe Julian has to leave. Nathan asks: he'll come back won't he? She answers: We've had him a long time Nathan. Laurie meets Julian and asks: You're going to be leaving? Then she adds: You know where we are.
 Indeed Julian goes back to the local town, with the pony. He finds Scoby, sobers him up in the creek, and they decide they have to go back to Driscoll and set things right. This includes getting the well working again, recover Scoby's reputation, and eliminating a mean and vicious family. They both are wounded in the final shootout, but get necessary help from the town folk.
 The last scene in Driscoll is Julian returning the RBS back to Scoby, who also has his badge back, and they part.

His Second Love - Epilogue
 On the way back to his second love Julian has another flashback to his first love.
""You told me once you were mine alone forever
""And I was yours till the end of eternity
""But all those vows are broken now and I will never
""Be the same except in memory.""
Track 13: Remember Me.
 Julian rides the pony back to Laurie and Nathan. It is interesting to compare here the two women in his life. Both were very beautiful. However one was from east coast society. The other was from Montana. And one in no way could have got down in the well to help her man. In contrast, the second one could and would as she was capable of running a farm. In short, the second lady was a far better fit than the first.
As he sees Laurie and Nathan and their farm in the distance he gets off the pony, takes off the saddle and bridal and gives it it's freedom, after years of service to his first wife and to him. Nathan spots him and then Laurie spots him and they all run towards each other.

The ending song:
An' in the shade of an oak down by the river,
Sit an old man an' a boy,
Settin' sail, spinnin' tales, an' fishin' for whales,
With a lady thet both enjoy.""
Track 14: Hands on the Wheel (These are similar lyrics to Track 10).",1299196800,2,11128,4.204033771106942
924980,3,630477334X,If you don't mind the violence it is a good movie and Willie does a good job acting. This is one of my husband's favorite movies.,1297382400,2,129,4.0
924981,5,630477334X,"I was stunned by the quality of this virtually unknown movie. If ever there was a sleeper waiting to explode on the scene, this has got to be it.

I watched it last night on cable Encore Westerns, which gave it only one star. But I've always been amused by Willie Nelson Westerns, usually good light entertainment, so I thought I'd give it a try until the one star rating reared its ugly head. I kept waiting and waiting for its promised mediocrity to emerge, but things just got better and better. By the end of the movie I was wondering where on earth the one star rating had come  from. Did someone say, ""Oh, this must only be one star because it wasn't big budget and I never heard of it""? What does the Encore Westerns star rating system mean, anyhow? Popularity? Reputation? If that's what it means, then it's one star, but no one uses that system for movie ratings, at least no one with a modicum of intelligence.

Enough of my rant. What about the movie itself? It has many of the characteristics of a classical Western, its setting and development. This really is the Wild West: lawless, where people had to take care of themselves without expecting any organized law and order. We have the familiar hero confronting evil forces in the face of cowardly townsfolk being bullied and exploited by those evil forces and in need of rescue by the courage of the hero. But in this case, the hero goes from the heights of idealism and uncompromising high principles and courage, to the nadir of despair and iniquity, only to rebound with newfound grounding in his original ideals, born from simple feelings of emptiness in his fall into perdition, and recognition that his original high mindedness is where life that is truly worth living is to be found.

There is also a parallel story of the hero's principal supporter, the town sheriff who is well-intentioned from the beginning but lacks the courage of the hero and requires the hero's courage to stand by his principles, only to fall himself into perdition like the hero, and later find redemption and courage that he'd never known before. That side-story is neatly woven into the plot and gives the story line a kind of elation that it otherwise would not have had. It was also kind of expected, and the fact that it didn't look as if his turnaround was going to happen made the actual outcome all the more joyful and satisfying.

This pattern of high flying morality followed by parallel and independent descents into hell, followed by redemption, is what is unusual about this Western, and is one of the principal elements that distinguishes this from almost all other Westerns. What includes this movie in the ""good guys vs. bad guys"" genre of the classical Western is how the hero - now heroes in the plural - vanquish the enemy in the end, just as so often happens in the worst as well as the best of Westerns. It is the descents into hell and subsequent redemptions that distinguish this Western from the lot, not just of one hero, but of two.

Another thing that distinguishes this Western is the quality of its dialog, especially from Willy Nelson. It is the dialog that one would expect from a thoughtful and insightful hero, but for that very reason, is completely unpredictable. There are no clichs in the hero's speech.  His verbal responses to situations are both surprising and completely within character and obviously heartfelt, giving the Willy Nelson character a reality and concreteness that one does not often find in Western characters. This is dialog that I know will stand the test of time: repeated hearings that one will never tire of and will continue to delight in, even when we have it all memorized, like for example in the movie, Fargo.

Now my only question is, why didn't this minor masterpiece ever make it onto DVD? I'd be the first in line to buy it. It's great that this Western has appeared on Encore Westerns, because maybe that means there will be repeat showings, prompting others to show up on this review page with their own reviews, and encouraging the industry to release this on DVD before it falls completely into obscurity, which would be a great cinematic loss.",1276905600,9,4166,4.666212534059945

925159,1,630477334X,"I don't like having to say it, but it's true. I watched this awful movie because of the inexplicably glowing reviews I read on this very page.

Now, I'm no realism Nazi, but neither do I want a movie to use me for a tongue-chewing imbecile. How many times can we be expected to believe that a player was shot dead only to find him bandaged and on the mend at the next fade-in? I counted two for the main character and three for his confederate! And where's a good guy in this thing? I counted two with spoken lines that were, at best, merely not bad - and one of those was a child. Also, who knew that winters in Montana were so short that they pass in their entirety in just one, quick scene?

Far be it from me to get so specific that I might spoil anyone's disappointment, but I have to ask rhetorically: If a rowdy bunch of bad guys on horseback who have only to touch the flaming torch-in-hand to a wooden tower that they came to destroy by fire are SO intent on carrying out the deed that they shoot dead the one guy that tries to stop them, why in the world would they then simply depart the scene and neglect to do their intended act of arson? And perhaps even more head-scratch inducing, why would they come back later and shoot another guy, but this time bust a few moving parts on the thing and leave it reparable - which repair then, predictably happens? Sorry, but though the answer to that question be entirely true as, ""Because otherwise we wouldn't have the rest of the ridiculous story,"" it's simply not good enough.

925321,5,630477334X,"My favorite western. Push for it to come out on DVD! Looks and feels closer to what I imagine a real outback town in that time, and how people would look, dress and talk.  Plain, poor, dusty, dirty - no fancy sets, spotless clothes, give-away modern orthodontics. Water is scarce, people sweat. What has more value than water? Kudos to the set master, costume designer, makeup, actors, writer, director and editor. Story moves along slowly and pleasurably with nice surprises, e.g., delightful dialogue, realistic violence (did I just see that?!). Existential, earthy, simple, satisfying. Suprising honesty, fewer words, more truth, time to reflect, muse about life - love, loss, revenge, betrayal, forgiveness, courage, acceptance, redemption.  It doesn't forget we like to be entertained.  It is speckled with dry humor and a bit of silliness to boot. That Willie isn't a professional actor adds a touch of realism, but he is surrounded with good actors. Good lines, delightful wit, great score - Willie's own gritty voice and story-line songs are the perfect fit.  Great gunfight at the end. More a ""sit back and savor"" than ""cling to your seat"" enjoyment. ""Is your horse worth the life of that man!? . . .  I couldn't say . . .
