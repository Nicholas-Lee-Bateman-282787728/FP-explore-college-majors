8109243,4,B000EGDC2S,"Over six chapters this documentary plots a course through the history of an ancient power overshadowed by Rome, Punic Carthage. Re-founded Carthages under Caesar Augustus then Emperor Justinian are also mentioned.

Prosperous from its strategic location and trading ability Carthage was brought into conflict with Rome. Initially victorious due to naval superiority, after three wars they were totally defeated. This was despite Hannibal's successful venture from Spain into Italy via the Alps in 218 BC.

Carthage was razed to the ground in 146 BC when it is thought up to 500,000 people were slaughtered. The city had a darker religious side of Baal (Satan) worship, and child sacrifice (to the devil Tanit or Astarte). Remains in urns were found in the sanctuary of Tophet. God had judged Israel for sacrificing their children to Tophet, in the valley of the son of Hinnom.

The city was rebuilt for economic and social reasons and experienced great prosperity during Pax Romana. At the same time they murdered many Christians in their colosseum, including Perpetua and Felicity.

After Rome's collapse temporary help came in 533 AD from the east with Emperor Justinian. When muslims arrived in 696 AD it was destroyed permanently.

A number of expert historians provide commentary so the viewer can have confidence in the information. There is also an extended question and answer section, and a short self-test.

Overall a great little production.",1441065600,,1452,5.237068965517241
8109244,5,B000EGDC2S,"Great introduction to Carthage, video gives lots of geographic visual information that you cannot get from reading a book.  Used this for a sixth grade report and it was very helpful, better than the usual Wikipedia stuff, also interesting for adults.",1340755200,,251,5.121951219512195
8109245,4,B000EGDC2S,"Gives a good description with imagery enhancements of how Carthage looked in its prime (246 BC). It however does not give you a guided tour of the city visiting the Senate building or the Palace at the Byrsa as it was at that time, though it includes overall views of the naval harbor and admiralty building that housed one of the greatest secret libraries of its time that included records of Carthaginian routes to Ireland, Britain and Germany to the north, around Africa to the south and new lands across the sea to the west. I would have liked a tour through imagery of that period of Carthage at a time were defeat in Sicily decided its future, moving from a Kingdom to an Empire or a Republic, with the latter winning out. Carthage was the greatest republic of the ancient world, as told by Aristotle and other philosophers of that time.",1191801600,5,843,4.552631578947368
8109246,3,B000EGDC2S,"It's often repeated that the Roman Empire was huge.  However, historians and teachers then just focus on the City and don't discuss pre-colonial life.  (A small exception is seen in Russell Crowe's ""Gladiator"" character being from Spain.)  This documentary speaks of Carthage before and during the Roman conquest.  Carthage is now what we call Tunisia.

This is a British documentary probably meant from British audiences.  The scholars interviewed are not diverse.  Many have teeth that could be featured in the Simpsons' ""Big Book of British Smiles.""  The work has computer graphics and actors pretending to be ancient people.

The work goes into why Carthage was important, how it got its name, etc.  Like much on Rome, they speak of gladiators, bath houses, and mosaics.

I wasn't glued to this documentary.  However, I appreciated what I learned and thank the makers for putting it together.",1178150400,4,896,5.145833333333333
