The transfer is awful, obviously a print from a print from a print. And as I'm sure, as many of you are aware, with each subsequent printing contrast increases and light gradation decreases leaving a picture that is only extreme light and extreme dark. Overall I've been pleased with Troma's transfers but this is really bad.",1434412800,,458,4.810126582278481
8399981,5,B003M0NLV0,"A lot of reviews complain that this is basically a Florida gore flick minus the gore. Well, yes, that's true, but so what? This is the kind of movie that follows its own rules, and the unusual plot (an artist teams up with a mad scientist to deform people so he has models) is pretty great. Add some realistically unlikable characters, a strange free jazz soundtrack, and a psychedelic rock interlude and you have B-movie gold like they just couldn't pull off nowadays. Go into this expecting classic drive-in fare and you won't be disappointed.",1377993600,3,545,4.747368421052632
