7825354,3,6302420873,"This program is usable if you have practiced Balletcise for Beginners for a while, but it is less useful than that (absolutely terrific) video.  Whereas the tape for beginners leaves time to relax and shake your legs between exercises, the ""Advanced"" program takes you through those same exercises without the necessary pause between each, forcing you to pause the video if you want to shake out the old legs.  Then it adds some slightly more difficult exercises.",1382486400,,463,5.0
7825355,5,6302420873,"This is definitely my favorite dance video. It's perfect for someone who is very out-of-shape, because it's a very safe way to restore flexibility and strength. I've transferred this to DVD, just in case my old VHS machine dies.

Her program really helps,especially post=baby. Get this program going with a good eating program and some cardio-weights and you'll like the results!!",1360108800,2,286,5.377777777777778
