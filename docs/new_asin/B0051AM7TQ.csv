8452491,5,B0051AM7TQ,"The other review mentions packaging problems, but it's a standard DVD packaging. I got several of these and all the discs were in place. Sometimes in those black plastic DVD cases the inner plastic tabs that hold the DVD break off in shipping and the disc comes loose, and the publisher will usually send you a replacement if you ask for it. Anyway, never got the chance to write this up back in the day, but it's an excellent DVD for fans of the sport, as is the one before this. I don't think it's fair to one-star a DVD for shipping damage, as reviewers should be reviewing the content of the film here, and this reviewer clearly never saw it.",1357776000,,646,4.347107438016529
8452492,1,B0051AM7TQ,When I received the DVD in the mail the disc was lose in the case and it scratched it to the point that it skips while watching it.,1345161600,,131,3.7142857142857144
