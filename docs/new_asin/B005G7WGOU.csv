8544970,2,B005G7WGOU,I received this with anticipation but ended up disappointed as I have owned all 3 films in the package already! They were bought individually previously. The description at Amazon was so lacking that I didn't know it was a repackage of the 3 individual films into a pack with a new fanciful name!,1363046400,,296,4.60377358490566
