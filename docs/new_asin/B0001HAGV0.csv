2001398,4,B0001HAGV0,"A really great value. The Buster Keaton alone is worth the price -- really. I'd watched very little of his stuff before, but now my 8-year-old son and I are hooked. (He even keeps my 3-year-old daughter's attention!) But then you also get a decent sampling of many of the early American film comedy greats. Too heavy on the East Side Kids and light on Laurel & Hardy and Harold Lloyd, but at least you get to see something of them. I love having the Our Gang (Little Rascals) stuff. And thrown in for some reason is Laurence Olivier in Shakespeare's As you Like It, as well as His Girl Friday with Cary Grant and My Man Godfrey with William Powell (from The Thin Man movies) -- 3 more huge pluses. You also get a chance to see Jimmy Durante, Mickey Rooney, Peter Sellers, Humphrey Bogart, Carole Lombard, Paul Muni, James Cagney -- all great stars, even if not in their greatest movies.

It's an odd compilation, with no apparent rhyme or reason, but that's part of its charm. I'd say you'll get a lot of pleasure out of this collection if:

1) you have an appreciation for (or at least curiosity about) the first couple of generations of American movie comedy (through the 1940s)

2) you can handle a few silent films (like the fabulous Keaton's)

3) you can overlook some occasionally poor sound/film quality.

Sure, there's some stuff here that's not worth having, but a lot of it's really funny & entertaining, and for dirt cheap. So don't throw out the baby with the bathwater. This is an excellent buy for the money.",1152403200,38,1522,4.52

2001408,5,B0001HAGV0,This is a great collection for the price I paid for it. My son and I have enjoyed watching the movies.,1174003200,7,102,3.9047619047619047
2001409,4,B0001HAGV0,"I've really been happy with this collection, but you have to know what you are getting. Quite a few of the entries in this collection are 10 to 20 minute long silent comedy shorts, and some of them date back to the 1910's. The shorts include those from Arbuckle, The Keystone Kops and other Mack Sennett shorts, 10 entries from Buster Keaton, and an early 1923 entry from Stan Laurel before he teamed up with Oliver Hardy. None of these films are the best work of any of the comedians involved, but they are still funny.

There are a couple of very good screwball comedies from the 30's - ""My Man Godfrey"" and ""The Front Page"". Also included is the 1940 remake of The Front Page - ""His Girl Friday"" with Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell. Spanky and Our Gang show up in ""Follies of Our Gang"" in which they put on a show. The Bowery Boys also have a few entries. There's even an Ernst Lubitsch film - 1941' s""That Uncertain Feeling"" starring Merle Oberon and Melvyn Douglas in a funny romantic comedy. 1946's ""Angel on My Shoulder"" is a great film which has a murdered gangster (Paul Muni) returned to earth from hell so that he can inhabit the body of a judge for which he is a dead ringer. Instead of doing evil, though, he accidentally keeps doing good in the judge's name, making his sponsor from down below (Claude Rains) very unhappy.  Harold Lloyd shows up in his last film - ""The Sin of Harold Diddlebock"". This film is funny enough, just not up to par with Lloyd's silent work. ""Love Laughs at Andy Hardy"" is made in 1947, and Rooney is just too old to be doing this at this point. The film completely lacks the pre-World War II charm of its predecessors.

""The Smallest Show on Earth"" was an unexpected pleasure about an old movie theatre that has seen better days. When the new owners show up and are disappointed with it, the ancient staff gives the place a facelift to please them so they can hold on to their jobs. ""Passport to Pimlico"" is another British comedy that is very funny, probably just unfamiliar to you. ""Sandy The Seal"" isn't a comedy at all, it's more of a dramatic family film. Even though it was made in 1969 it has absolutely awful film quality, and I'm really not that picky. Most of the other entries are funny enough, just not noteable comedy classics.

If you like silent slapstick and classic comedy from the 30's and 40's you'll probably enjoy this collection, and you can't beat the price.",1172880000,23,2424,4.452702702702703
2001410,5,B0001HAGV0,Great price! Great movies! Nothing 'Gone With The Wind'-ish or any of the modern so-called classic movies of today - but I didn't want anything from today. Sometimes I'm just in the mood for something innocent and fun. This hits the spot!,1168041600,13,238,4.690476190476191
2001411,5,B0001HAGV0,"I'm not sure what box set of comedy classics the majority (certainly not all) of reviewers on this page saw before they commented, but it couldn't have been this set.  I'm a pompous DVD snob, and should run screaming from a discount, grab-bag set like this, but I love it.  It gets a full five stars because of its selection of classic 30's comedies, its watchable (and sometimes near-perfect) print materials, and its overall heft and value for dollars spent.

First of all, the complaints about the quality of the prints is ridiculous.  Most of these films are from the 30's, and even then, the prints are very watchable, with scratches and debris, yes, but very little given the age of the films.  Granted, His Girl Friday is a grossly overcut version with plenty of scratches, and is hard to watch, but for every film like this in the collection, there are 7 or 8 others which are surprisingly well-kept, considering their age and the price of the set.  I'm watching the films on an HDtv, and if the films were transferred poorly, I'd see it plainly on my tv, but there's no digital artifacts, no combing or ghosting AT ALL.  This set would look even better on a tube tv (which wouldn't pick up all the things the HDtv does)!  Not only that, there are a few films on this set, including My Man Godfrey, Love Laughs at Andy Hardy, Something to Sing About, Angel on My Shoulder, Beat the Devil and Stork Club, which are in surpringinly fine condition: they are what you'd expect on a regularly priced, single DVD.

This set is full of classic comedies from the 30's, and the films are full of art deco style.  From the opening credits to the music, clothing and sets, these films show off the sleek lines and sharp contrasts of that style.  Magnificent.

Migawd, this set has Lubitsch!  John Huston, Eve Arden, James Cagney, Jimmy Stewart, William Powell, Carole Lombard, David Niven, Harold Lloyd, Preston Sturges...coupled with the fact that the set is full of rarely seen films, some of which have not been released on proper DVD's, this is a treasure box, people.

Simply put: this set is indispensible to the classic film buff, and at a price which cannot be bettered, I bet.  I have a few of the 50 packs, and enjoy each of them very much.  Treeline is a fine company, and I'm thankful to them for making available so many great films at a ridiculously low price.",1166227200,74,2371,4.556603773584905

I haven't had any problem listening or watching any of these movies!

8012548,4,B0001HAGV0,"I have not watched any of these yet (just got them), but I noticed that the box cover was different, so I studied the description, typed in the list on the back, sorted & matched what was there/not.  The description states 67 movies, so one knows something is amiss since it's a 50 movie pack (and there are 50 movies listed on the box set, and there are 12 dvds).  The reviewer Annie Van Auken gave a detailed list, and except for about 3 titles, it matches my box set.  My box set cover has a bright blue background and a single man w/ black glasses grinning on the cover.  I rated it 4 out of 5 since I have not watched them yet, taking one star off for wrong description, once I do watch them, if my opinion changes, I'll update the review.  One more thing, the packaging is a little difficult ... the 12 dvds come in sleeves inside a box bigger than necessary, yet constricted on the inside so that the dvds are awkward to remove from the box ... minor detail, just thought I'd mention it.",1415145600,,994,4.2105263157894735

However, the product, which comes in 1 1/2- 2 inch thick box in cardboard, was sent in a cushioned envelope rather than a box, so that the box was crushed upon arrival. Since the product is usable, I did not return the product. However, I would warn potential buyers to check with the supplier if the product will be shipped in a box or an envelope, since part of the enjoyment from the purchase is a package that is still in good condition (Who wants to purchase DVD boxes for 25 DVDs at the Dollar store?). As for the films in the collection, I have purchased several collections of films put together by Mill Creek Entertainment and enjoy watching these mostly older movies and TV programs. The video and audio reproductions are sometimes low quality (e.g. scratchy audio), but these movies and programs are still a delight to watch.",1340755200,,918,4.672839506172839
8012551,3,B0001HAGV0,"There are several movies in this that are not comedies. Some, such as ""Made for Each Other,"" with Carole Lombard and James Stewart, has some light humor, it is really a drama. Even drama requires humor in order to come off well.

There is a some over emphasis on some. The East End Kids are featured many times. This takes away time for other great comedies. Cary Grant was great in comedy due to his delivery. There is only one Grant movie.

The Keystone Cops movies I watched were not the classic slap-stick comdies that I expect. In fact, they hardly had anything to do in the movie. ""Lil Abner,"" was listed as starring Buster Keaton. Wrong. Buster played Lonesome Polecat. The star was Jeff York as Lil Abner.

Don't expect the slick movies of today. These were done over 50 years ago. For their time, they were pretty good.
