2258752,5,B0008FXSQA,"If you love stand up comedy, this will be a dvd that you will enjoy and get some laughs.  If you love stand up comedy, are Italian, and can relate to living as an Italian in the ""old days"", you will be in histerics.  I bought this for my 83 year old Italian mother.  We watched it with my sister and we laughed so hard at times, we needed to pause the dvd because our stomach hurt...honestly.  We have since watched this many times and it never gets old.  Pat Cooper (Pasquale Caputo) tells it like it was, growing up Italian.  Stories of his mother, father, and the rest of his family are endearing and hilarius.  If you grew up Italian, you will relate...laugh...and absolutely love Pat Cooper and this dvd.  Divertiti!",1221091200,,721,4.409090909090909
2258753,2,B0008FXSQA,"""Not Rated?""  Well I'm rating it.  It gets an 'R.'

There are a lot of 'f' words both in English and Italian.  I like almost all things Italian, and Cooper's  'Italian' humor is so-so, but I found the language detracted from it.

If the 'f' word doesn't bother you then like I stated, it's a so-so performance, but not all that great.  This DVD is worth about $5 (certainly $10 max) for the quality of humor.  As for Cooper's performance style, it's not what I really like, but you may if you like loud, opinionated ranting.",1208390400,5,524,4.385416666666667

I was looking for some content showing him younger and for some of the content that helped make him famous at the time it was new. not old material performed or the umpteenth time",1393545600,,204,4.256410256410256
8056012,3,B0008FXSQA,"Love Pat Cooper and have loved him since I was a little girl and my relatives played his comedy albums on their stereos!

 Now flash forward to adulthood and yes, I still love Pat Cooper. He is a mix of laughter, nostalgia and my own family memories.

But gauging the age of this video, versus the last few times I saw him live?

I can see he is recycling his material big time. It shows in this video and it shows in his live performances.

This  man appeals to Italians/Sicilians for the most part.

If you are not Italian/Sicilian but married into a family of such, you will get the humor, too.

However, if you have seen him live in the last 5 yrs- skip this- unless you never get tired of hearing his repertoire of jokes.

Again- loveable guy- and a very talented comedian even if his main genre is Italian humor.

 But if he produces another video of his stand up act, it really needs new material.

While his live acts show dated material, he is still a master at what he does.

He doesn't miss a beat- no pauses, no forgetting what he wanted to say.

He is young at heart and can put on a great show.

 But Pat, PLEASE..... introduce some new, but relevant material, and you can be back on top of the game again, as the number one comedian for Italian Humor!

That being said, Pat is in his 80's- he really doesn't need to work.

Or maybe he feels he does, because to him, stand up is not working- he is having fun.

 God Bless him and that attitude.  The man will always remain a classic at what he does.

However, for those of us use to seeing him perform ?  It will remain ""same ole- same ole"" unless Pat freshens up his act.

Video starts with a personal intro, showing Pat with his wife and assistants as they go on their way to Red Bank NJ, where you will see him perform.
You get a few minutes to glimpse PAT as PAT and hear his thoughts on life and why being a comedian might be career- but it is NOT his whole life.

The man has his values straight- and listening to him offer his insights about this made me smile",1374019200,3,2031,4.1461538461538465

8056015,1,B0008FXSQA,"Pat Cooper's earlier records were much funnier. In this one (YOU'RE ALWAYS YELLING),  he begins what seems like it will be funny, then either loses his train of thought or abandons it by another distraction.  Also, I'm not a fan of dirty-joke humor, which he dabbles with here. That doesn't take any talent, and he should be above that.",1236556800,5,336,4.677966101694915
