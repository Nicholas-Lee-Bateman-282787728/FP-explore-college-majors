8072904,5,B000A2X8NE,This video is very well done and has a lot of information about most species that trappers persue. This is a very well done video with some scenery thrown in. Not really a begginers video but good entertainment for trappers.,1330214400,,224,4.625
8072905,4,B000A2X8NE,"The DVD is a digitalized reproduction of the 1990 tape.  Great Rocky Mountain scenery during the winter.  Makes you want to pick up your traps and move out to the high country, but bring your snow shoes.  As far as the trapping instruction is concerned, the material is slightly dated and basic in nature.  It does an excellent job of showing the transition from water trapping in the lowlands early in the day then trapping in the low foothills during the afternoon and finishing the day up in the high country.  This is all well and good for beginners looking for something basic yet entertaining.  The sets are explained with enough detail to provide overall viewing pleasure.  This DVD is not of the HOW-TO type, but some instruction is given for specific sets.  For water critters like Muskrat, Mink, Beaver and Otter the DVD focuses on mostly water sets of the pocket and cubby style with footholds and body grippers.  The low foothill sets for Wolverine, Fisher, Bobcat and Coyote inlvole dry land cubby sets and snares.  The high country line involves running tree sets (a.k.a. upside down cubby sets) and limb sets for Marten and Weasel.  All in all a good video for an early Saturday morning viewing with your coffee.  The DVD reproduction quality was a little scketchy regarding lighting in the lowlands and the match-up between the audio and the movement of Larry's lips was not quite in sync. Still a good buy none the less.",1173312000,4,1437,4.7269076305220885
