7959063,2,B0000639GX,"This show continues to disappoint me, a two parter takes up most of this volume thanks to Pioneer only putting 3 episodes per disc back in the day.  It mostly involves Ukiya and his crew getting teamed up with an American Jun Thunders and European counterpart Jim Skylark, a older guy and girl who belittle their abilities and act like jerks before working together to defeat the dumb Invader bad guys who are now taking over junk islands!?
Seriously the plot of the Invaders is to make a giant monster Battleship out of junk on an island of junk. The English dub is great again as it has Steve Blum playing the European(!?) gatekeeper Jim Skylark that helps Shun this time out and grows to respect him. Seriously Steve Blum is who you get to voice a British gatekeeper agent? And yes his voice work is better than the voice actors for Ukiya and the gang, and also Johnny Yong Bosch kind of shows up in parts as Reiji Kageyama, our shadowy Char Clone of bad guy who apparently Ukiya hasn't figured out yet is evil.

The last episode is a light breezy dumb affair about a force arranged marriage of the AEGIS secretary girl Keiko to a loud, obnoxious guy who acts like he might be involved in the yakuza.
Though that really turns out to be a dull surprise, another invader plot, and other scenes mostly involves the lame romantic baloney that occurs between the other characters and the girls pining after Shun again. The plot introduces new characters in the two part episode, this really doesn't introduce anything and is rather goofy.
Again this show at times really annoys me but I go on through it, it's characters though are sometimes yes legit unlikable, especially Megumi.",1508976000,,1679,4.6120401337792645
7959064,4,B0000639GX,"Gate Keepers is a series that seems to have somehow ""slipped in under the wire"", garnering precious little attention when it was released by Pioneer in 2002.  I found it almost accidentially, having first seen its OAV ""sequel"" GateKeepers 21, which piqued my curiousity about this earlier TV series.  But I tended to disregard it, since it seems at first so very different in tone than its successor, being almost goofy and light-hearted by contrast; this only slowly gives way to a greater seriousness of purpose.  It's almost a satire or cliche of the typical ""sentai"" or fighting team shows that began to appear in Japan in the 1960's, when this series probably not-so-coincidentally is set.  The first four discs slowly build the team, each of whose members have the expected strengths and weaknesses inherent in their backgrounds, personalities, or fighting ""specialty"", as they battle largely faceless Invaders whose intent and purpose remains unclear.

This disc finally gets around to confronting those two so-called Invader Executives, Kikai Kaiser/Shogun/""Machine General"" and Count/Hakushaku Akuma/Devil, thereby advancing a plot which had become rather monster-of-the-week in nature.  Three new gatekeepers also arrive, not to ""help"" with the fight - but to completely take it over, leaving our cast temporarily spinning their wheels.  They also bring with them new Gate Robos, robots to help channel and augment their ""gate energy"".  Unsurprisingly, this fails miserably thereby allowing Shun to save the day, temporarily destroying the executives in the process; only the mysterious Shadow Gatekeeper escapes.  The highlight of this two-episode segment is the merger of the Kaiser/Shogun with what appears to be a WWII-era Yamato class battleship he has dreged up from its watery grave to engage the combined gatekeepers!

The final episode features a somewhat silly exploration of ""feelings"" through the reactions of the group to an arranged marriage being urged on their secretary, moving the ""rivalry"" of Ruriko and Kaoru over Shun forward.  Gate Keepers continues to remain an easy and pleasant diversion, with just enough mystery and engaging characters to make me want more!",1251331200,,2194,5.404692082111437
