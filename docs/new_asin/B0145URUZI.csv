7383834,5,B0145URUZI,"I watch wkrp  because it is filled with humor, everyone in the series makes you laugh, no one seems to do any thing right, but it keeps you guessing what will they do next. The actors give you those laurel and hardy stares. they do outrages things at wkrp, for instance the radio station manager comes up with a great publicity stunt for ,thanksgiving, He takes turkeys up in a helicopter and tosses them out, thinking they could fly, while the news anchor down below describes the action. This series was cancelled after 4 years, too bad,  today comedies are not as entertaining no do they even come close to wkrp in Cincinnati.",1455062400,4,629,4.557522123893805

7383839,3,B0145URUZI,"As I wrote about the first season, I don't know where the transfers came from for these but I expected better video quality for the year these aired. Most look like they were transferred from a VCR tape, a few are better. There's glitches in some of the episodes and some video distortion as well. I have 60's sitcoms that are higher quality. I don't understand why this is but I'd rather have this than listen to the ""Generic Music"" BS via Hulu. The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because of the music restoration is fantastic !. I would recommend it if you don't mind the video conditions.",1514678400,,599,4.405405405405405

7383857,5,B0145URUZI,"This season has some of my favorite episodes, including the ""phone cops"" and the one where Johnny sleeps over at Bailey's house. The characters are all well-developed by this point and I would love to know how they would have continued their crazy antics. Too bad there were no more seasons.",1474588800,5,291,4.7254901960784315
7383858,4,B0145URUZI,"This is one of the Releases that has most of the original music restored. I counted it off a star only because I didn't think the sound quality was that great. The dialog was not bad but a bit tinny. The canned laughter tho' was a bit annoying in many places. There's no tone control on my TV, so perhaps with a better sound system it's OK or can be adjustable. Still, I've been waiting for the later seasons for some time and glad to get them despite the sound. I will buy the others as I can afford them, including season 1 which I have on the earlier release that didn't have the proper music.",1474416000,,596,4.146551724137931

8729767,5,B0145URUZI,"RP Saves Best for Last
The usual pattern for sitcoms is to be sputtering to a finish or taking a victory lap if you will. Not WKRP in Cincinnati. They actually had what I believe to be their finest episodes (minus Turkeys Away) at the very end of their run. I include in this: the episode where Les decides to try and make it as a television news man in New York, Venus gets charged with robbery and has to rely on the WKRP staff as character witnesses, and the episode where a fire breaks out in the building. But I don't think you would go wrong with any of them.

Some people will mourn that we didn't get more of WKRP. I prefer to think of the positive. It didn't become a stale broken down shell of itself like so many older television favorites and has left true fans with some amazing memories. On a related note, if you want to hear about what it was like to create WKRP, there are some very interesting interviews with Hugh Wilson online that I think will give a greater appreciation for this quirky show.",1524182400,,1014,4.253886010362694

8729772,5,B0145URUZI,"My husband and I were faithful fans of WKRP during our twenties.  I purchased a few dvds as a gift to his collection.  Our teen and young adult children watch with us sometimes and find WKRP amusing and sometimes bewildering, as it should be for them. lol The quality of our dvd is very good.",1518825600,,292,4.290909090909091
