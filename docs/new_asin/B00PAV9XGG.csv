6791637,5,B00PAV9XGG,"Season 1 of this dark family saga sees us meeting the eccentric artist Veronika Grnnegaard. She is doing a new exhibition and is in the middle of her own ego massage when she decides to contact a local florist and takes an unusual shine to her. She then gives her a letter telling her she is the sole beneficiary of her house - worth ten million Kroner. The thing is she has a husband -Thomas - and three children, but she then tells this florist Signe - in a scene reminiscent of Darth Vader that she is actually her daughter - mwaahh!

What follows sees the other children come back to get their inheritance or whatever they felt is rightly theirs and the wheels start to come off. This is the sort of plot where there are so many skeletons in everyone's closet that you can see why they would need such a huge house just to fit the very large closet in.

This then is deliciously dark with some double deals that Machiavelli would have kicked himself for not having thought of. All the players are above excellent. The cinematography is flawless and the whole thing hangs together with a style and class that the BBC used to be able to do. This is one of those addictive serials where as soon as one episode ends you just have to see the next one. And yes there is a second series - absolutely brilliant, absolutely addictive and absolutely recommended.",1427587200,19,1356,4.42
6791638,4,B00PAV9XGG,"I was given this DVD set as a give, and I enjoyed this series a great deal, but I think the packaging and advertising are very misleading. This is only season 1, and season 2 turns out to be available only on a region 2 DVD. The text on the DVD says ""...the tensions do not abate from start to finish over 10 episodes"" - you'd be forgiven for thinking that ""finish"" actually means that the DVD set contains the complete story, when it is obvious at the end of the 10th episode that many story lines are left dangling. Only with some investigation did I discover the link below to  to Season Two in UK format only:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legacy-Season-2-3-DVD-Set-Arvingerne-The-Legacy-Season-Two-NON-USA-FORMAT-PAL-Reg-2-Import-United-Kingdom/dp/B00XEGTWQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legacy (Season 2) - 3-DVD Set ( Arvingerne ) ( The Legacy - Season Two ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 2 Import - United Kingdom </a>] Be prepared to be left in the air if you buy only season one.",1454198400,4,1032,5.37037037037037

6791641,5,B00PAV9XGG,"I read the reviews on this site and was intrigued. It does not disappoint. The characters are complex and flawed and one's view of them changes constantly as does the relationship between almost all of the pairs of the characters changes....... as a result of the original action taken by Veronika weaves its way into the fabric of this family, creating and unraveling (and churning up secrets and choices).  The twists so far (I'm at the end of series one) do not feel contrived but they do feel plausible in a family where so much is below the surface. I enjoy the Danish cadences and the rhythms of the language as well.  The opening credits are wonderful.  The actor who plays Robert is devastatingly handsome.  All the characters seem developed, complex, and human.  I read somewhere that the series creator wanted to stop the series before it started to get stale.  Great plan! But- that has not happened- please give us the next season!",1451174400,,943,4.719512195121951

6791645,5,B00PAV9XGG,"Totally sucked in. Recommended by a friend, was not interested in subtitles. I promised 2 episodes before making a final decision. After 1 I was mildly hooked. After 2 I'm all in and can't get enough. Waiting on the 2nd season and having withdrawals in the meantime. Spectacular acting and story lines that keep twisting keeping us on our toes.",1445731200,,344,4.75

6791654,5,B00PAV9XGG,"Absolutely as well done as well done can be.  Everything about this production is superb, including the slomo exploding vase of flowers that introduces each episode.  Acting and cinematography create a fictional world that reflects the [heightened] actualities of everyday reality at a level that competes with what it previously seemed that only Shakespeare could do.  But then, this is a Danish production from top to bottom, and perhaps Hamlet himself lurks in that Elsinore where only the greatest fictions occur.  If you want to watch top quality in every aspect, watch this. (Spoiler: Unlike in many BBC productions, the snow in some scenes here is compellingly actual.)",1435104000,2,676,5.231481481481482

6791656,5,B00PAV9XGG,"I was fortunate enough to see Season 1 of The Legacy on KBTC - MGz Worldview. It was so well acted that I forgot they were actors, and not real characters! The storyline has been well described elsewhere, but it truly drew me in! The lifestyle of the avant garde artists as well as the absorption and dedication of the professional athletes are contrasted nicely. One longs to whisk Signe away before the rest of the egotistical and greedy family can get their hooks into her!
A film like Maggie Guyllenthal's, A Woman of Honor - so richly composed and acted I just hated to see it end!
Since MHz Worldwide has made the cruel decision to remove their foreign mysteries and dramas from commercial TV, if there is a Season 2, it will only be available online! Pity...",1434067200,8,765,4.510791366906475
6791657,5,B00PAV9XGG,"i'M WATCHING THIS right now IN TEL AVIV, ISRAEL.and it is fantastic  have only seen the first season - waiting for the second to come on.  also watched something called A PLACE TO CALL HOME - also loved it.  Just wondering why we don't see this kind of television now that we have 300 stations!!  This is what I call amazing TV.  It's the kind of high that HOMELAND and HOSTAGES was when first came out.  My adivce - DON'T MISS THEM!!!",1428969600,4,435,4.2439024390243905

This Series is set to be my NEW FAV..
Cant wait to see Series 2.
The writing, story line, characters and acting....Kudos !!
This Dan-Dram has It all..
If your looking for American flash---forget about it.
If your looking for well written and acted Drama that has you invested in the characters by Episode 2...The Legacy is for You.
If you are New to Danish Drama---this is your perfect place to Start.",1461542400,2,503,4.662921348314606

8687227,5,B00PAV9XGG,"Note: The Legacy, is known in Denmark as Arvingerne, meaning ""The Heirs""...The Legacy/Arvingerne is beautifully filmed and impeccably directed series with performances that have captured top Danish TV honors  for drama and also acting awards for the actors who play conflicted egotistical siblings Gro and Frederic. That said, it's the refreshingly natural actress who plays the lovely cast-off daughter Signe who will steal your heart. I know just enough Danish to have watched on Danish TV,  but it seems like there may be some extra scenes on the dvds, which was fantastic. (Maybe its a directors cut?) Anyway, if your native language is English, you will never EVER regret buying this perfectly subtitled 4 DVD set. It is a flawless production!",1454803200,6,748,5.1735537190082646
