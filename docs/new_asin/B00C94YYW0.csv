5707514,4,B00C94YYW0,"I have watched this movie on Netflix and was glad to have given it a try despite my reservations watching foreign B movies. I was impressed and if you are a fan of street/contemporary dance, you have to watch this movie. Although I did not understand the language I was able to interpret much of the movie by the events and the facial expressions. The movie itself is quite long and can drag quite a bit especially in the beginning. But once the dancing begins, you are in for a treat. Prabhu Deva, as the protagonist, Vishnu, performs one of the best dance sequences I have ever witnessed. The dancing in this film is much better than what you typically see in pop shows such as America's Best Dance Crew. The choreography will boggle your mind. But Deva is the star of this show and for good reason. He does a tribute to Michael Jackson. He was simply amazing as he took the moves to another level. The story is kind of corny and very choreographed but you will see some of the best dance sequences you will ever see on film. I would put the moves above You Got Served and Step Up. Who would have thought that the Indians would outdo the Americans at their own moves. Be warned, though, the dialogue is in Indian for the most part. Have an Indian interpreter next to you so that you can make out what is being said. Or, just enjoy the movie for the dancing. By the way, Jehangir Kahn, sure looks so much like Kevin Brauch, Iron Chef America's floor reporter. Amazing. Two thumbs up!",1370390400,5,1484,4.3610108303249095
5707515,5,B00C94YYW0,"Any Body Can Dance (ABCD) is the best Hindi dance movie that I've seen in the last year. It is amazing. It is heavy dance with a lot of modern jazz dance in it as well.

This movie does not lack in storyline either. There's a little something for everyone: love, drama, sadness and joy. I love this movie so much, I've watched this move 3 times and I love the dance sequences so much that I want to buy the movie so I can watch them for years to come.

My 6 year old watched it with me. He didn't understand a word of the movie, but he was fully engaged by the drama, music and the dance of this amazing film.",1370304000,2,609,3.9430894308943087
5707516,3,B00C94YYW0,"Waiting for this to be release as 3D, as it was presented in theaters. Anyone know whether this will happen anytime soon?",1368057600,,121,4.545454545454546
5707517,5,B00C94YYW0,"Absolutely loved this film. Great dance film. The choreography, the story line and settings were good. Illustrated dance as an essential activity in life and dance as a form of worship. Prabhu Deva is a wonderful dancer, one of India's best contemporary dancers. Note: ABCD is available with English Subtitles. Enjoy!",1428364800,,317,5.235294117647059

5707521,5,B00C94YYW0,"This is a movie I have recommended to my dancers as a current Bollywood interpretation of contemporary dance !
Bravo Bollywood !!",1399766400,,129,4.909090909090909
5707522,5,B00C94YYW0,"Seriously just love this movie. Its a bit of the naive genius  making a comeback  after being kicked down from his glorious life by his ambitious friend thats lost his way. Yes its a bit corny sometimes but thats why.  The dances in this movie are really fun to watch since it has so much variety in styles and outfits from clowns, to ballet , to tradition wear, its just fun to see. But what gets me with this movie is that ending oh my god!!! i swear i kind just rewind it over and over again and get hyped up every time  i watch its just awesome.",1395878400,,549,4.055555555555555
5707523,5,B00C94YYW0,Love this movie so much that I ordered it as a gift for a sister that doesn't generally like my Bollywood flicks! She LOVES it too!,1389225600,,131,4.076923076923077
5707524,2,B00C94YYW0,"Even with all the considerable resources of color and choreography that Bollywood customarily brings to bear on its productions, ""ABCD: Any Body Can Dance"" has no more depth, maturity or sophistication than its American dance-film counterparts like ""Step Up"" and its sequel ""Step Up 2: The Streets."" And it's a lot more cloying and lengthy to boot.

Prabhu Deva stars as a mopey dance instructor - who can be a bit of a drama queen when things don't go his way - who takes on the task of whipping a group of high-spirited but decidedly undisciplined youngsters from the ""ghetto"" (which looks only a shade less affluent than Beverly Hills) into a presentable troupe in time to compete on an amateur TV dance program.

It's all pretty much paint-by-numbers as Vishnu (Deva) takes his charges through their various stages of readiness, with teeth-rotting cutesiness and thumb-sucking childishness the order of the day. The dancing's okay, I guess, but, I seriously think it's time for Bollywood to grow up a little and stop pandering to this apparent need on the part of its audience for emotional primitivism all the time. As one character, in a rare moment of honest self-reflection, says about the entertainment industry in India, ""Mediocrity is king."" Truer words were never spoken.",1374710400,,1283,4.990654205607477

Its fun, lots of great dancing, music, and great story behind it! They need to make a musical out of this, this should be on broadway!",1373155200,3,266,4.134615384615385
8578845,2,B00C94YYW0,"This is NOT the english version i saw, once upon a Netflix. Good movie.....since i know the story line...but to my kids....theres only the idolatry. Think im going to trash it. If i really want to see the dance scenes...theres YouTube.",1528502400,,235,4.7560975609756095

The dancing is amazing. For a fun and exciting movie this is a must see.,1478736000,,251,4.081632653061225
8578847,1,B00C94YYW0,"It was advertised as English sub-titled, no such luck I bought it but you did not live up to your advertisement.  The dancing is outstanding and worthy of watching without being able to understand Hindi. Shame on you!",1476662400,,217,4.7105263157894735

Too bad there are no subtitles during dance scenes.
I hope there will be a crossover between Anybody Can Dance & Step Up.",1452470400,,139,4.384615384615385
8578852,3,B00C94YYW0,The movie is exactly as promised - it is a dance move however the subtitles are only on the spoken parts not for the singing. It is a musical and the words to the songs are just as important as the dialog.,1438905600,,205,3.9047619047619047
