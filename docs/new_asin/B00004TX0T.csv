7923193,5,B00004TX0T,"For now I can only write a few lines, it's 10.29 PM ET, here in the United States of America, and I am sitting on the threshold awaiting 2005 to enter my life. And yes, this is what I did tonight, instead of going out to celebrate the new year, I stayed home and watched the Alexandria Trilogy, one after the other, 1,2,3.

Indeed this is the best, and only way, to watch such a rich, colorful, exotic series. I knew nothing of Youssef Chahine until about ten days or so ago, and am I ever so glad I heeded the reviews here, at amazon, and indulged my whim of renting his Alexandria Trilogy as well as two of his other films.

The Trilogy is a keeper and I will purchase it soon, most likely after I finish watching Chahine's next two films, Destiny and The Emigrant.

I will return to write a longer review because this series is worth it, and not only because of being exotic and romantic, but also, because it's educative. More of us Americans should watch foreign films... truly today's world is a global village.

Happy New Year, y'all! Slainte.",1104451200,2,1050,4.369230769230769
7923194,5,B00004TX0T,"This is the second part of Chahine's Alexandria Trilogy. The first part ""Alexandria, why?"" is a biography and courageous self-examination of his adolescent years. This part moves on to examine his adult life. It is, again, a very courageous, honest, and insightful self-trial of himself as an adult and his choices in his professional life as a movie director, as well as in his personal and family life. His artistic talents as a director and his creative thinking are reflected in his representation of his turbulent relationship with his inner child. This is another distinguished piece of work by this talented movie director and a must-have for those who appreciate his art.",983750400,5,679,5.071428571428571
7923195,5,B00004TX0T,"I am going to divide my review to three parts, the basic reproduction / packaging, the subtitles and last the actual art:
The basic reproduction is good in comparison to any other Egyptian movies you can buy. Good is by no means very good nor excellent
The subtitling is very poor. It is very clear and will help keep non-Arabic speakers in the game, but it is seriously inaccurate and in my view often distorts the meaning of the movie. I was particularly amazed to see things like ""damn you all"" being translated into ""fxxk you all"". It is truly absurd to subtitle anger into profanity
As to Youssif Chahine own work, it is very clever, at times way too clever. The symbolism goes to the extreme that you just end up going in circle. See how clever and symbolic I can be
The presentation of the gay side of Mourad is certainly brave, but does not seem to be much more than a ""dare"" game, often it is unclear why it is there and what impact does it have on the whole thing, except for possibly the middle film
As to the camera work, direction, music, acting etc. it is all excellent, well above anything else coming out of Egypt in the last 25 years or so. The real shame is to be the only really good moviemaker in Egypt and to use this to make such narrow movies with too much symbolism.
At any rate, make no mistake about it this is great stuff",974851200,8,1348,4.26953125
