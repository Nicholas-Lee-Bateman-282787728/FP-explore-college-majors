2452777,5,B000C4BBZ2,"This DVD is a captured moment in time; I believe this will live forever as a record showcasing the genius of Neil Peart - the best and most popular drummer of modern times.

(Voted Modern Drummer Best Recorded Performance in 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985, 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1992, 1993, 1997 and 1999 - and many, many other accolades besides).

I've been waiting for a long, long time for this DVD.

Work In Progress was a great insight into Neil's analytical mind, but this is just fantastic and way more enjoyable.

Okay. Firstly, Neil, moreso I think than on Work In Progress, comes across as a humble, amiable and genuine guy with a total LOVE for drums. His incredible R30 drum set is set-up from scratch here by Lorne Wheaton, his drum tech (whom is interviewed with Paul Northfield). Like Kieth Moon's old set (a set Neil craved as a youth) Neil's R30 set has icons set within frames on each drum, and each icon depicts a moment from Rush's 30 years. The hardware is 24 carat gold plated. Oh, the extravagance! :) His Sabian Paragon cymbals are demonstrated in a feature on this DVD as an extra, whereby we see the process of manufacture and the 'sweat and tears' that went into creating them, under the watchful eye of the 'Professor' himself.

In fact, this leads me to the extras. Oh boy. It's crammed. We got unreleased 1994 Counterparts concert footage, the Show Of Hands solo snippet, a solo recorded in Germany on the last tour but previously unreleased, with which one can compare and contrast subtleties that Neil makes to his solo each night (keeping it fresh), we got two 30 minute (and over) 'explorations' whereby we observe Neil at practice, simply exploring new concepts, fills, rhythms, ideas...""what ifs"" - and we got a systematic piece-by-piece breakdown of Der Trommler; Neil's 2004 solo (which I was lucky to see live twice here in England).

I especially loved the chance to view Neil taking us through the sampled big band horn blasts triggered by his pads. Yep, he improvises here for us too too. He talks about 'being there' at the onset of sampling, mid-80s, when if leads were too long there'd be a delay, and when floppy cards were used in sampling computers.

Neil mentions Buddy Rich, Gene Krupa, Joe Morello, etc etc and basically cites these as key players, amongst many others, who have handed us down this wonderful concept of 'drum soloing'. Many drummers, such as Kieth Moon and Stewart Copeland, refuse to 'solo', but the message here is; let's celebrate the art and marvel at the creations of the wonderful showpieces of the craft - and keep drum solos alive! It's our duty as drummers.

I've followed Neil's playing ever since I can remember and what comes across in Der Trommler, to me, is a point in time where his solo (and drum kit) comprise everything he has done; we have waltz, march, freestyle, odd-time, and of course the homage to the Big Band masters like Buddy Rich. I have been lucky enough to see Buddy Rich 3 times. I've seen many great drummers, Vinnie Colaiuta, Alex Van Halen and so on...but hand on heart nothing ever compares to a Neil performance. Neil's father once told him to play to each audience as though it was the most special performance of his life. You never get short changed with him.

Basically, you have to buy this DVD. It's choc full of extras and is put together really, really well. There is much interesting dialogue and also Mambo's Dance Party and Pieces Of 8 on audio which can be accessed. There are two drum-camera perspectives of Tom Sawyer and Subdivisons from the Frankfurt concert in 2004 and also O! Baterista! is here too. Anything more needed??? (Well, I'd have loved the Grace Under Pressure solo and possibly the Exit...Stage Left and maybe a Power Windows Tour solo...but...we can't have everything can we? Although I hear the Grace Under Pressure tour footage is being made into a full length concert :)

Occasionally, when one really builds oneself up for a DVD release, the result can oftentimes be disappointing.

This isn't. It's incredible. Neil is a genius, a master (though he'd humbly refer to himself as a lifelong apprentice) and he's better than ever! SALUT!",1134345600,13,4169,4.720770288858322
2452778,5,B000C4BBZ2,"First of all, for those ones who don't know, Neil Peart is the drummer and lyricist of Rush, as well as a world-renowned bicyclist and traveller and a nice humble man.

This new solo DVD is flawless. Perfectly executed, blazingly loud, monstrously full of energy. Watching Neil on drums is something mind-blowing even for guys who don't know anything about rhythm tempos, drum equipment and all that stuff like me. But I still appreciate the complexity of Peart's playing.

The quality of the DVD is superb as well, showing why, deservingly, Neil Peart is considered one of the finest drummers of all time.

Tremendous gift for all Rush and non Rush fans. You must be a witness of this level of musical perfection!. You need only witness one of his unearthly drum solos to realize that this man must, be linked to his extensive drum kit for no other explanation could satisfy those trying to comprehend just how Neil Peart does when he's ripping away at the skins.

Enjoy, this is a delight",1134345600,6,990,4.705202312138728
2452779,5,B000C4BBZ2,"No doubt my friends. Neil Peart is THE premiere drummer of the world. The intensity and overwhelming abilities of his exceptional playing is even bigger than his inhuman Drum Kit.

The highlight of this essential release is when he goes beyond human capabilities on an improvised nearly 30 minutes long solo. The first part is in the first disc, and the second one, in the second DVD. It's magic worthy of cranking up the volume to deafening levels.

Everything's enjoyable. The instructional explanations by the professor Peart, the unseen footage, all the solos displayed here, extras, etc. Excellent production, masterful sound, extremely well cameras work and elegant photos.

Overall this is a fantastic and worthy release, not just for Rush and prog fans, for every single drummer in this world. I've seen many drummers DVD before, and this is simply incredible. He's a humble man, a fantastic person and he proves it here. This is not an excercise of self-indulgence, rather, he really wants to show us that he loves playing drums and he loves to teach us his inhuman style as well.

Moreover, he doesn't pretend that he's the best drummer in the world... how many drummers have said that?... and how many of them have even a glimpse of the ability and the knowedge of the professor Neil Peart?

Neil Peart really stands this apart with this gem. Get this now!",1134259200,9,1367,4.849785407725322

This is a ""must have"" if you want to see the Professor in action...close up!!! Definitely worth having in your Rush collection!!! If I were asked to make a choice between this documentary and the previous, ""A Work in Progress,"" hmmm...that would be a tough one. I'd be more inclined to suggest having both. One is based more on studio recorded music where as the other one is more toward live performance. For me, the choice is definitely to have both!!!",1409961600,,609,4.446428571428571

2452791,5,B000C4BBZ2,"Neil Peart is one of the brightest, but most down-to-earth premier rock drummers in the world today. This DVD reflects that fact beautifully with Neil's almost Zen-like manner of relating his drumming philosophy in simple, almost poetic terms. He is not trying to teach the audience how to drum like him - quite the contrary. His purpose is to provide sound advice as to how to drum your own style of solo in a flow and progression that is meaningful to you, while pleasing to your audience. I drum solely for my own pleasure to CDs in my studio now that I'm older (51), but this DVD has breathed new life into my desire to play solos. If you want sage advice, and mind-blowing entertainment from Neil's impossibly expert drumming, you will love this DVD. WELL worth the price!",1381017600,,777,4.597122302158273
2452792,5,B000C4BBZ2,Yes! I do!  This is an amazing video!  I was never a big fan of the drum solo.  Neil turned all that around for me!  I never realized how much he puts into what you are listening to.  I now listen to his drum solos like I would a piece of classical music.  He is an amazing man with a unique talent.  If you are a musician and especially if you are a drummer this is a quintessential piece of video for you!!!,1373760000,,409,3.855421686746988

2452794,5,B000C4BBZ2,"What an amazing drummer!  And what an amazing set of drums (drum kit), new lingo for me.

I am not a musician nor drum expert, but I know amazing when I hear it and or see it.  Neil Peart is tremendously talented musically, and brainy to boot.

I could watch this many times and never be bored, so anyone that loves drums and/or Rush would absolutely love this DVD set.  These DVD's are similar to a Director's Cut commentary on what goes into making a great movie.

You would have to be a brick to not appreciate Peart's techniques, expertise, and how much time & thought he has invested in his passion for drums and perfecting his love of making great music.

Even a non Rush fan will enjoy seeing this behind the scenes look at a true genius at work.

I was thinking of getting a copy for a friend in Oz, but Amazon is only selling Region 1 version (the US/Canadian).

If you are a fan and don't care how the music is made, just buy a Rush CD or go to a concert instead.",1328659200,,973,4.160427807486631

2452797,5,B000C4BBZ2,"I'm not a musician, even as a hobbie.
I'm not a Rush super mega enthusiastic fan, but I really like Rush lot.
I got this DVD due to my 10 years old son is starting getting drums classes and he is becoming a junior drums player. As a father, my role is provide guidance, so... that's it!
Unfortunatelly, it doesn't have legends in Portuguese (even in English), so my son will need to improve his English learning, but it's not a problem when you can learn drums playing from the ""god of drums""!
All the material is very well prepared, organized and amazingly produced.
DVD1 is ""The Method"" as well. Neil is pretty clear in all of his explanations and we can fell his passion doing that.
DVD2 is ""The Best Bonus"" you can have in your DVD collection, it doesn't matter the subject. Try that!
Thanks Neil to share your knowledge with us, your inconditional fans.",1319500800,,858,4.471337579617835

2452799,5,B000C4BBZ2,"Neil Peart is in his element surrounded with drums, and he opens up to the drummer who wants to learn his style of ""drumsmanship"", or to the drumming aficionado who wants to better understand what's happening behind the bass drum when the master is performing. If you think the drum solo is a good time to take a break from the concert, don't buy this DVD! It's not for you! If you're the kind of concert goer who puts the binoculars to your eyes when the solo starts--I think you'll enjoy this video. Although, if you don't want to know how the sausage is made, and if you want to believe the awesome solo is not meant to be understood, but just accepted as a gift from the gods, you might be better entertained by a Rush concert DVD (also very entertaining!).",1286409600,,761,4.366197183098592

2452803,5,B000C4BBZ2,"Anyone who knows of him is aware that Neil is a terrific drummer.
Two things about this video that struck me are:
1. how obviously humble he is.
2. how much of a technician he is.
Personally I find this to be a bit of a drawback because while he's busy focused on technical aspects he's not as motivated by ""feel"" as much as he probably could be, as he probably could have been.
The more technically involved you get as a drummer the more you become ""mechanically inclined"" and the less you play from the ""heart"".
Another drawback of the video is that he really doesn't focus on hi hat technique but then... that's his style of playing and he's done a rather good job with it over the years.",1237507200,,691,4.282442748091603

2452806,5,B000C4BBZ2,"First and foremost, Peart is my favorite drummer. Overall this DVD  provided great insight on how and why Peart plays what he plays, his likes, his influences, and how he has evolved. I was stunned to learn that he took lessons recently and altered his techniques. It just goes to show you, you are never too good to continually learn. He has a genuine passion for percussion. This DVD appears to be more of an inspiration then instruction.

I loved this video because I've been a Rush fan since I was about 6 years old.  I've always been in awww of the great master. This DVD answered a lot of the questions about his playing and the things I've always wondered about. It also shows his fabulous DW Collector series drums which was enough to put me over the edge to purchase my own DW collector series. (Drool)  It also covers his Roland V drums as well as his electric pads.

The 2nd DVD shows a few songs in live performances from recent tours as well as a documentary from Peart's trusted drum tech hard at work.

I've been drumming for about 20 years. The DVD set is a little pricy but it was the first DVD of any drummer I've ever purchased. For me it was well worth it.",1226275200,2,1176,4.322727272727272

Quick delivery and the dvd was in great condition.

Take care, God bless.",1221264000,,127,3.8846153846153846
2452808,2,B000C4BBZ2,"I have been playing drums since 1970 and never really understood the fascination fans have with Peart. Although I do dig his playing on Tom Sawyer. The one hand 16th note hi hat groove is pretty cool and going back and forth between 2 & 4 on the snare & double time is hip. Too bad he doesn't ride the hi hat with the left hand ala Cobham & Chambers.

I bought the DVD in hopes that I would be converted into a fan. Unfortunately no such luck. To me his solo is pretentious, sophomoric & boring. He seems to be build his solo on placing the down beat of a rudiment (say an inverted 5 stroke roll or parradiddle) on a tom or cymbal while filling the rest of the beats on the snare drum. Then playing fast single strokes around the kit. His electronic melodies seem like childish nursery rhymes in comparison to NIN. And his double kick playing I find lame (no pun intended). I keep waiting for him to ""kick it in"" like Joey Jordison or Cobham - it never happens!

Check out Thomas Lang DVDs for inspirational double kick drumming and Jojo Mayers DVD for mind blowing stick control. Steve Jordon for hip grooves and Jeff Porcaro & Zoro for feel. When it comes to drum solos watch Dennis Chambers, Billy Cobham, Buddy Rich & Bozzio vids. For effortless odd time Vinnie Colaiuta. Not to mention Pearts jazz drumming is elementary compared to say Smith, Erskine or dozens of others. His idea of Jazz is Gene Krupa & Duke Ellington mine is Tony Williams & Miles Davis.

Peart mentions how difficult double cross overs are. I taught myself how when I was fourteen - they are easy to do!

On the song Subdivisions I am expecting a replica of Stonehenge to descend from above and gnomes to prance around the stage. Neil would be a great replacement for Joe ""Mama"" Besser in Spinal Tap as long as he isn't susceptible to spontaneous combustion. Maybe that is what the washing machines are for.

So what is it with Peart!? You would think after so many years of drumming Neil would be able to solo in a myriad of styles, yet he confesses that he still builds on the one ""tired"" solo he has played for too many years.

To me It's a toss up between Neil Peart & Travis Barker for the most uninformed, idiotic, clueless drum fans. I guess if you still have acne you might enjoy both of those drummers and this DVD which would be better named Autopsy Of A Drum Solo.",1218240000,5,2351,4.3439635535307515

The camera angles are superb, letting a curious drummer see what the heck he's doing to make that killer sound.  Of course the DW drums and the Paragon line of Sabian cymbals help!

I have the Rio DVD and like this one better (cameras jump around too fast in Rio).  This won't show you how to be a great drummer but it will inspire you to try hard.

The reason I have not watched it is that disc one will not play in my DVD player (though my DVD player has no problem playing other DVD's).  Thinking this merely a fluke, I returned the product and got another one.  Again, I can't play disc one.  Disc two plays, but I won't watch it till after I've seen disc one.  Disc one will play on my computer, but I want to watch it with good sound, so, other than seeing if it worked, I haven't watched it (hopefully it will work on a new DVD player, when I get one).  So, the bottom line is that disc one of the set appears to have some issues such that it may not play on all DVD players--it certainly doesn't on mine.

2452823,5,B000C4BBZ2,"This 2-disc package contains so much. First, there's the preamble, in which Neil talks about the aetiology of the art of drum soloing, with the likes of Buddy Rich, Gene Krupa and the guys of the big band era. Then through to the rock solo greats, such as Ian Paice of Deep Purple, Bill Bruford of Yes, Carl Palmer of ELP, John Bonham of Led Zepplin etc... Neil discusses his early years of playing, the inevitable 'piano lessons' - which stood him in good stead for later years, and his experiences of his first bands as a youth.

Regarding examination of his 9 minute, 'tour-de-force' solo, what you get is a total 'scientific dissection' of the Frankfurt, September, 2004 R30 solo - up close and personal in the studio. Each segment is discussed, with interesting comment on inspiration, and why he added this particular piece, or what mainly influenced that: the tom-tom rhythms of Krupa, the attacking, explosive snare work of Buddy, the bass flams of Bonham etc...

Neil demonstrates his technique in playing the various sections of his solo and in doing so shows you close-up of how he plays each instrument; Pieces of 8 and Momo's Dance Party played on his electronic percussion, 'the drum also waltzes' Max Roach routine, also used by Bruford in 1985/6 in his solo, and so on.

***Bonus Material***

Disc 1. Der Trommler. Total breakdown and analysis of technique and method. There are then two 'sidebars'. Sidebar 1 has another solo: Ich Bin Ein Hamburger. A recording of another solo from the same tour, shot from above (a great angle). (This solo flowed so well). And sidebar 2 has 'Exploration #1"". Here we sit and watch Neil going through not only his warm up routine, but also see how this takes him to new areas, the 'what if' thing. It has to be said, the quality of filming and audio of Paul Siegal and Rob Wallis is, as usual, first rate.

Disc 2. Exploration #2. O Baterista! solo from Rush In Rio. An interview with Lorne Wheaton, Neil's loyal drum tech, and Rush co-producer/engineer, Paul Northfield. Lorne Wheaton sets up Neil's amazing kit from scratch (including the rotating 'satelite' riser) and discusses it. 2 Rush - or rather 2 'Neil' - performances from the drum cameras on the R30 tour, (Subdivisions and Tom Sawyer are the featured tracks) - and there is also a never-before-released drum solo from the Counterparts tour, 1994 (in structure, similar to the drum solo on Different Stages).

In addition, Neil has included 2 audio tracks: Momo's Dance Party and Pieces of 8, and OH there is also the Show of Hands solo included, and also 'the making of' featurette for Neil's signature Sabian PARAGON cymbals!

This is an extremely comprehensive, well-crafted DVD...and I recommend it.",1165795200,27,2717,4.805139186295503

Niel Joined them in 1975(or sone such before Anthem release) in a begging attemp(so I've heard) by the others who lost thier other drummer from diabetes or something.  Neil was easily put into the captain's chair as Rush was desparate.  He was not only a great drummer but a decent writer of songs and got better around Caress of Steel and 2112, the very epic album in thier career to me personally.  These are his drum only solos but I think some close footage of his drum work in other songs would be nice too.(Anthem is quite odvious as you see a good shot of his aggression using full arm strenght on the cymbols. very good Peart footage there).  Usually in these concerts and ""videos"" you only see his shadow but for the drum solos.  Here you get the lined up collective of solos(minus maybe a few as in ""Broon's Bane, and the '76 All the World concrert).  If you want to see him in action on other songs you get only a few clips of an unsteady cam in ""Exit Stage Right"" and ""A show of Hands"".  this contains also the O'Bastiria from the latest concert.  Neil also has a tutorial but don't even try to buy the collective of his drum set it will cost in excess of half a mill!",1165104000,5,1545,4.329861111111111

Peart deserves the credit he gets for performances on albums like Hemispheres, Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, Exit Stage Left..., Signals, Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows and those tours. But in my personal opinion the man has nothing left in the tank.

I have seen this solo done in various presentations since the Hold Your Fire tour. Nothing changes tour to tour with the exception of the same parts being rearranged.

So if you want to spend an afternoon watching a guy warm up and going out of his way to do nothing then this is your dream package. If you want to be inspired by drummers who go out of their way to bring something exciting, new, fresh, and truly goes to the max with his playing...then I suggest you look elsewhere.",1147046400,9,943,4.568047337278107

Although I have been a RUSH (and Neil) fan for almost 20 years let me tell you that during many parts I got really bored.  Mainly, because for the most part what you get to watch is Neil's drum solo over and over again from thousand different angles and performances (Rio, Germany, or the studio).  I already had enough of it by replaying the solo included in the Rush in Rio DVD. In other words, the DVD would show you a solo part of the Rio performance and then that same solo part played by Neil in the studio.  Personally, I got tired of listening to the solo (which for the most part we've all been listening for years).  Lots of repetition of him playing and not so much technical explanation of what he's doing.  To me the best part is not his saturated solo but his warm-ups.  Those are really good although somewhat too long.  However, it seems to be too high a price for those two warm-ups.

This forum is to review the work not express an opion about someone who obviously knows nothing about drums or drummers. But I have to say...Mr Young you are WRONG ! If other instruments have solos, are not drums an instrument?  Nuff said.

Any one who drums, loves drums ( but doesn't play them ), loves Rush, or just ""The Professor "" himself should own this DVD. All us Rush fans know he is a very private individual so not only do you get some displays of great drumming but a little insight into the man himself.

2452838,5,B000C4BBZ2,"Neil, it seems, is just getting better these days. This DVD is what I believe could be considered a documentary on and of Neil Peart's drumming. Definitely a plus for Drummers and RUSH fans. It may not necessarily speak to all musicians or fans as it does to those with a higher perception. Neil himself has said he can a bit dry in personality at times, but the subtle nuances of one can be seen in this DVD, much more than in his first run at the DVD market, ""A Work In Progress"". Great insight into the thought process for his work, as well as the tribute paid to all those who currently and have inspired him to produce his work. From African village Drummers to Jazz Legends, Neil puts forth an all-encompassing solo of major proportion. Don't look to this as being an instructional video, unless you consider the motivating factor alone as ""Instructional"". My assumption is you should know how to play drums already if you're watching his videos. This isn't about teaching one to play drums, but more an approach to drumming and soloing from Neil's perspective.

 As for the reviews, this is practically a 5 star combined total for reviews, with the exception one real non-fan, Mike Young.  He reviewed it, but for sure did not watch, he therefore is a fraud... Amazon should remove him completely. I'd like to stick my ""Big Money"" boot up his ""Red Sector A""ss. Read his reviews, this dude is a snively little ""Punk"" rocker. One cannot make CONSTRUCTIVE criticism of another without first understanding the basic principles and the origins of drumming.

The DVD is a breakdown of Neil's drum solo ""Der Trommler"" (German for The Drummer)  from the 30th anniversary tour, R30 (also available on DVD, a must own itself). One of the first things Neil points out that is not to teach you how to play his solo, but to inspire you to create your own and follow your thoughts and talents to make a drum solo fun and something you can use to better you playing. On this DVD, Neil is more open and accessible than ever and really gives you a good insight on how he puts together his solo for each tour, always changing so as not to become stagnant. He explains where the ideas for parts came from and how he incorporates different styles into his own playing. Included on this DVD are 2 version of his solo ""Der Trommler"" from the R30 tour, ""The Rhythm Method Solo"" from the Counterparts tour in 1994, ""O' Baterista"" solo from the Rush In Rio Tour, and camera only views of Tom Sawyer and Subdivisions from the R30 tour. Also included are the songs ""Momo's Dance Party"", a percussion piece Neil wrote and ""Pieces of Eight"" another song by Neil that was written for Modern Drummer Magazine. There are also interviews with Paul Northfield, Rush co-producer and engineer, and Lorne Wheaton, Neil's drum tech discussing the set up and sound Neil wants from his set. All in all, a great DVD.

I've never seen such blasphemy in all my days about such a respected Musician. Not only should you be ashamed of yourself, you should shut that snively mouth of yours. It seems almost intentional of you to be so negative. Those who know music know that technically Nickelback and Coldplay have nothing on Neil or Rush. They probably respect and admire him/them as idols and heros and you have no right speaking on behalf of them. You do them injustice as well with your haste.

I apologize to anyone who has read my remarks as I have no real feedback about the DVD except that it is wonderful even for a non-drummer.

If you're only interested in drummers who play simpler backbeats like a lot of today's Alternative Rock drummers do, this is not your video.  If you prefer to learn how to be creative and purposeful in your soloing, and want to watch a musician who OBVIOUSLY PRACTICES a GREAT DEAL of different types of drumming, you simply cannot live without this video.  His ""explorations"" show the human side of his playing while still leaving you wondering how he does some of what he does.  The biographical history of his solos lets us in on all the worldly influences he's drawn from over the years, and his musicality reminds us that a drum solo when crafted well can be much more than ""Wipeout"".  The quality of the production is outstanding, and Neil's monologues about soloing are thoughtful and well-spoken.  A must not just for Rush fans of all ages, but for anyone wishing to watch a master of his craft demonstrate and explain how he got to the highest highs of musicianship.  I also recommend the group's R30 and Rush in Rio video, as well as Neil's ""Traveling Music"" book as well.  ""A Show of Hands"" for The Professor as he proves how being ""Driven"" to learn about different types of music and drumming can lead to ""One Little Victory"" at a time behind one of the most impressive drum kits ever assembled!",1140652800,5,1349,4.615062761506276

2452852,4,B000C4BBZ2,"While Neil has always been my drumming idol, there are no revolutionary moments in this DVD set.

Every good drummer's solo should have context-a beginning, middle, end, etc. We're reminded of that here and learn how Neil came up with his latest solo. Every ""movement"" has an origin or influence and he explains them in detail. He dissects them on the kit as he speaks and then you can view the same segment live.

There are also 2 half hour segments of Neil sitting down and practicing. It's great to watch Neil sit down and see where his ""explorations"" take him. But again, nothing revolutionary here.

Don't get me wrong, every Neil Peart fan should own these DVDs. It's of the best in sound and visual quality. There are great extras of pure drum angles on classic songs live. There's also a nice segment of the setting up of his kit and some interviews with the producer of many classic Rush albums.",1140220800,4,904,4.567901234567901
2452853,5,B000C4BBZ2,"Although some have reviewed this DVD and stated that it is not an instructional video, that's not exactly true. A good bit of this 2 DVD set is talking about the approach and concepts of creating a drum solo to inspire us to create our own. Another good bit is showing us how Neil came up with his own solo material.

My favorite is the ""waltz"" section. This is by far the defining moment of the DVD where you go, ""oh. I see. A master."" To watch Neil playing a waltz beat with the alternating bass drum / tambourine trigger with his feet (Boom Ching-Ching, Boom Ching-Ching)and then on top playing a multitude of independent times with his hands (7/8, 4/4, etc) is truly inspiring and unbelievable. I tried to learn to do this, but I can't. It's interesting to note that he couldn't either, at first. And THAT'S one of the inspirational bits of this DVD. He didn't just pick up the sticks and do everything we see today all on natural talent. He refused to give up and worked at it until he mastered it.

I always liked that part of his solo but I never realized what he was trying to say with it. He is completely free of time constraints in his mind, and it's really almost hilarious to see the complexity of what he is playing paired with how effortless he is making it look. Unreal...

So the DVD is instructional in the sense that, if you already know how to play drums and you are looking for ideas to push you to the next level, then this can do it for you. There's no rudiments here, no sticking exercises. But, there is an answer to the long-discussed debate about why the traditional grip he touted in ""A work in Progress"" was dropped in favor of using mostly matched grip and sometimes traditional grip.

There are also wonderful biographical insights. Mostly, though, it's watching his thought processes and what motivated the different parts of his solos that interested me the most. Of course, with all the parts broken down for you, it's much easier to pick up tips on playing more fluidly and smoothly, if not more creatively. So overall this is a great effort by Neil and a must for anyone who at least appreciates the intricacies of his solos.",1139702400,108,2161,4.44949494949495

This dvd looks into the art of constructing a drum solo and we all know that Neil is one of the best at drum solos of all time. He explains who his influences were at soloing and then we see one of several solos by Neil, live. He then goes on to breakdown each section of the solo and answers all of the questions anyone has seen him live has had.

For anyone who plays the drums, this dvd will definitely open doors for you on putting together your own drum solo. For a Neil fan, this is a perfect follow-up to A Work in Progress, which dealt with songs and technique.

For a Rush fan, it takes away some of the mystery as to how Neil does what he does live.

The bonus material is worth the price of admission alone. I played the dvd for a friend of mine that is a drummer and not that familiar with Neil. He loved it and said it changed his approach to soloing.

The production was first class. Great angles and great sound. It is very interesting to hear Paul Northfield talk about his production on Rush albums, but most important its amazing to hear Neil talk about his drumming....for over 3 hours. There is no fluff in this package and is invalubale for a drummer at any level.",1137456000,6,1197,4.1869565217391305
2452855,3,B000C4BBZ2,"I am an active musician, with love for Peart's lyrics and drumming. I also own R30, Rush in Rio, A Work in Progress and A Show of Hands. In this scenario, I don't think $50 justifies the price of this DVD, mainly because much of the performance on it is already on the above-mentioned DVDs.

To note that I am not trying to copy his style, his solo or his setup. I use parts of his solo for my warm-ups and daily exercises together with other influences such as Minnemann, Blackwell and my namesake Donati. Nevertheless, I find more refreshing his insights on how his traditional grip (described in A Work in Progress) altered his approach to drumming than this suumum of a day's work of video and audio.

Negatives

- two warm-up takes (of which Exploration #2 on the 2nd DVD is better than #1). This is not to say that the performance is poor, but rather that there's a sense of urgency to it. Something like ""let's tape this and be done"".

- a kit set-up (A Work in Progress and Google pictures would cover that).

- not really much instructional information.

- shameless plugs (TM) in several places (or is that a positive? :-)

- no depth to his drums when recorded by Mr. Northfield in the studio as opposed to the takes on O Baterista and Der Trommler. Rush albums he produced sounded pretty much the same way. Must be a British thing...

Positives

- glad to see Mr. Peart smiling again and feeling comfortable in front of the camera, to a point where he is more voluble than ever. I am really happy for him.

- beautiful, relaxed playing during his Exploration(s). When compared to A Work in Progress, he looks as he's enjoying it far more. He's allowing himself mistakes.

- said warm-up takes have beautiful parts and unexpected stops.

- cool kit, ""on that we all agree"".

Bottom line: excellent auto-biographical work, not really an instructional video. Good for Rush fans (myself included), not that good for musicians (yours truly). Overpriced for its declared purpose.",1137196800,9,1985,4.605113636363637
2452856,2,B000C4BBZ2,"OK, first off, I love Neil Peart's drumming.  His performances are always amazing and jaw-dropping.  I've been waiting for him to put out a DVD featuring his playing.  I don't know why he picked the company who produced this thing and I know I didn't get a bad DVD, but in several places during his dialogue, you hear boom stands moving with live mics hooked to them.  It was really distracting.  The DVD is supposed to be an instructional tool, yet theres very little actual playing on it.  There is 70% talk and 30% actual drumming.  There are NO performances on this DVD and NO solos. You'd think that after dropping down $45.00 that there would be more substance.  He mainly addresses his newfound ""conventional grip"" and runs that into the ground, over and over and over again.  His new technique shows nothing of the ""old Peart"".  If you want to learn jazz drumming, pick up a Buddy Rich DVD.  Its better and sure is a lot cheaper!!  If you want to hear any music/drumming outside of their latest album, you're out of luck on this one.  My advice...skip this one.",1137110400,11,1069,4.534031413612565
2452857,5,B000C4BBZ2,"I love ""behind the scenes"" videos.  More often than not, while watching a truly masterful performance, the amount of thought that goes into the performance is not really thought of by the viewer. This dvd gives the viewer all the thought processes (as well as the physical processes)that went into performing the solos and making this dvd.  The sound quality of the dvd is excellent.  My only complaint would be the camera work on the previously unreleased solo from Auburn Hills Michigan.  The point of watching a drummer perform a solo is to watch (while listening) and to see how the different patterns produce different rhythms.  One of the cameras angles that was used during the Auburn Hills solo was a complete distraction from the performance.  Still, this is a very inspiring video and should help even the most experienced drummers reach new levels in their playing.",1136678400,,876,4.925170068027211

Being a Rush fan since 1976, I can say without hesitation I have never had any ""red helmet"" experiences or telepathically induced sonic warfare fed into my brain. How do these people get their reviews past the Amazon sceeners??????????????????????????????

As a hobby drummer, a couple of years ago, I sold my drums and gave it up for a while. After watching this DVD, I'm tempted to get another set. The one thing that made an impression on me was that Neil implied that no matter what your skill level, use your inspiration to create your own voice. Thats important to me. I've tried twice to take lessons and learn music, I couldn't do it. Its like I understood, without understanding. I knew how to play, just not what I was playing. Despite that, I've taught myself to play by ear and managed to create my own style. ( After 25yrs ). Even though I'll never be professionally trained, I still have a great love and affection for the drums. Neil was a big reason for that in my life.

One highlight was watching ""Subdivisions"" being played from Neil's viewpoint. Thats the one Rush song I really enjoyed playing along to when I had my set. In watching Neil, I was pretty close at mimicking his playing. Not too bad for playing by ear.

Finally, on this DVD, Neil mentions other drummers that influenced him. Its really nice to hear him talk about John Bonham of Led Zeppelin. John was my other hero of the drums. John was a completely different drummer, and yet equally inspiring. To hear that Neil was influenced by him and his right foot bass pedal abilities was surprising. Despite learning more humility on the drum kit after watching Neil, I'm grateful for the DVD's insight into one of the greatest drummers of our time.

One special mention has to go to the behind the scenes guru's, Paul Northfield and Lorne Wheaton. What a job they do!!!  Thanks,  Paul.",1136073600,11,1827,4.504531722054381

There is also a very cool extra that shows you how he came to make his new signature PARAGON symbols.  Excellent DVD and I recomend it for anyone into drumming or RUSH.",1135468800,4,340,4.2
2452861,5,B000C4BBZ2,"I have been waiting for something like this for over 20 years. As a musician and lyrics fan (serious keyboardist, fool around on the drums), it has been hard to top Neil Peart in terms of passion, talent, drive, and intensity. But for all us Rush fans, Peart has also remained somewhat of a mystery. Whether it was his persona, playing or solos, we have rarely been offered the chance to get under the hood so to speak. This DVD does just that.

I have often wondered what drove Peart towards his playing style and what influences converged to help formulate this supreme drummer. Anyone who watches this DVD now knows. Whether it is taking us on a personal journey through his life, or step by step explanations and demonstrations of how he crafts his award winning solos, it's all here.

I also admired his reserved tone and humbled approach. He gives great deference to the John Bottoms, Bill Brufords, and other legendary drummers that both influenced and inspired him to greatness. Also worthy of note was his deep affection for the Count Baise Orchestra and we even get a glimpse of the original tune he plays along to on his Rush in Rio and 30th Anniversary tours. What a treat.

There's no fluff in this package, and if you are would be aspiring drummer or even an accomplished drummer, there is something here for everyone. If you are a Rush fan, well, you know what to do...buy it!",1135123200,7,1391,4.578313253012048
2452862,5,B000C4BBZ2,"Watching this DVD actually feels like you are hanging out with Neil.  You realize that he is just a normal dude like the rest of us and also has that drum bug just like the rest of us. We learn who and what has influenced him (Max Roach for the ostinato he uses during his solo, big band sounds, Bruford, etc..).  This is a MUST HAVE if you dig the heart of drumming and Neil's style.  Thank you Neil for sharing your love of drums drum legends with us. This DVD will be cherished by us TRUE fans.",1135123200,3,497,4.051020408163265
2452863,5,B000C4BBZ2,"Neil, ah - ahh - ahhhh (splunk) Peart is The Best rock drummer ever (I suffer from premature evaluation when it comes to Peart).  The video is a great show-casing of his talent.  This is referring to the phyisical drumming as well as the thought that goes into it.  This is a review of this DVD only so I will not stray too far... I believe that the dialogue is very scripted to have him come off as ""humble"".  Yet if you read his novels (specifically The Masked Rider), Neil is an elitist (for good reason).

I am not sure if these are considered extra features... yet being able to click and hear selected compositions from years past is great.  The DVD makes use of modern technology (being able to enlarge the picture of his drumming, being able to change the angle...).  The multiple solos are great.  The ""work-out"" was also great to experience.

I am not sure HOW he does it other than countless dedication/devotion plus natural talent.  Yet the outcome (his playing) is greater than the parts combined!

Thanks Neil!",1134604800,3,1024,4.571428571428571
2452864,5,B000C4BBZ2,"This stunning DVD is entirely necessary. The inevitable filler stuff of other drummer's DVD's aren't presented here. Everything's interesting, especially the explanations and improvisations. Technical aspects of drumming are welcome as well, despite you have to have more than a little knowedge about the subject to understand him. Anyway, you'll enjoy watching his terrific performances.

Most exigent fans will be pleased as well because of exceptional material here. Some drum solos of this DVD have been previously released, that could be somewhat dissapointing for non blind devotion fans, but also there's plenty of unreleased stuff, as the astonishing mindless drum solo at the studio, and the unseen drum solo from 1994 is another highlight.

For those ones who think Neil's style is more cerebral than physical must watch his blistering ability to improvise. The difference is incredible. How I wish he did a live solo without a scheme in the future!

There're fabulous interviews work superbly, and the extras are phenomenal. Video is cristal clear, bright and rich. Cameras use right angles and focus for each section of the solos. Filming style is simply glorious. The audio offers sharpness and clarity. Presence of every element of the drum kit is stunning

The overall impression is absolutely satisfactory. This is definitive a statement of Neil's reputation as the most valuable drummer in the world.",1134518400,4,1417,5.3408071748878925

8095653,5,B000C4BBZ2,"Quite a lot of the video is of Neil talking directly to you about the things that have influenced him over the years and how he has tried to incorporate that into his drumming. It is definitely very technical. Especially interesting to a drummer, I'm sure. It could certainly be a bit boring to a non-drummer, but the enormous amount of footage of him actually using his drums is amazing. If you are an aspiring drummer, or an established drummer, you must have this DVD. If you are a RUSH fan like I am, you must have this DVD.",1490486400,,528,4.343434343434343

8095660,4,B000C4BBZ2,"Neil Peart is the drummer for Rush, in case you don't know.  ""Anatomy of a Drum Solo"" is a two DVD set of Neil discussing his approach to soloing.  He breaks down a nine minute solo from September 2004 in Frankfurt Germany.

This is a must for aspiring drummers, especially those who want to solo.  Probably also a near-must for Rush fans.

A few notes scribbled down while watching disk 1:
+ When he was a kid, Peart wanted to be a jazz drummer.  Then he saw Buddy Rich on TV a couple of times and realized he'd never be able to play like that.  The consolation was neither could anyone else in the world.  Best stick to rock.

+ Why would Keith Moon solo?  He played everything he might want to during the songs.

+ It took him several year of work to be able to play split time signatures.  Something like 7/8ths over a 3/4 waltz was his first (hands vs feet).  He said looking back it's a wonder he didn't just quit and say ""I can't do this"".

+ John Bonham was his inspiration to learn to put triplets on double bass drums into his solos and with the band.

+ The length of the MIDI cable affects timing between the triggers (like the pads on his mini-marimba) and the output of the synth.  When you're playing stuff that has 100 beats per second, 10 ms is a long time.

+ The great grip issue: traditional vs matched (or symmetrical).  He started out using traditional, as his first teacher insisted.  A later teacher told him matched was fine.  Eventually he decided to switch hit, depending on the needs of what he was playing at the moment.  If you watch his hands during the demonstrations (and how could you not?) you'll see him switch back and forth.  Reminds me of when I was in a high-school garage band.  Our drummer could never decide.  He'd come from his lessons and be using a traditional grip.  Then as we played he'd use symmetrical (""Wipe Out"" would make him change).  It never occurred to any of us it was possible and OK to switch during a song.

+ One of his teachers early on said the two most difficult things he would learn to do is double handed crossovers and four-way independence.  He said he practiced for years at home on the crossovers.  He got a single handed crossover OK, but it took forever for two handed to click.  He had to work out exactly how many beats he could play on either hand before they would work.  Four-way independence--he is still working on 40 years later.

+ There is no such thing as a mistake in a solo.  Only new parts.

+ As a side bar at the end of disc 1 is a new, improvised 30 minute solo (Pieces of Eight) recorded during his practice/warm up for the video.

+ There is a DVD extra on the making of his signature cymbals.

Disc 2 is interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, bonus performance clips, DVD-ROM options, etc.  Watching the drum tech and the recording engineer setting up the drum kit was very interesting.  Complicated stuff.",1432771200,,2901,4.373358348968105
