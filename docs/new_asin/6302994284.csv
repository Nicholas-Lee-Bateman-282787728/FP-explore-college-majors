7833662,5,6302994284,"Stella Adler was possibly the last of the great ""master teachers"" of acting. A student of Stanislavski himself (as opposed to Lee Strassberg, who took everything second hand and made himself more important than the part), she is everything you could wish for in a teacher. Her passion for the theater and all it touches is incredible; and since, in her view, theater touched on everything from the classics to the drunk asleep on the Bowery sidewalk, she encompasses the world.

Any artist should see this film. Any writer, any actor, director, dancer, teacher. In fact, now that I think of it, everyone should see this film. She was that rarity among rarities; a teacher who imparted life with every breath.

I have never found such quick resolve, such passion and such ability in one woman to answer the question: ""what is great acting""? The interviews and scene work in the film, gives one the feeling of being present in one of her lab classes. The advise she gives is timeless and indeed priceless. She answers age old quesions with profundity and enlightens and excites the viewer to participate in true theatre - the 'deep theatre' as she puts it.
I watched it once and rewound it, watched it again making notes, fell asleep, woke up and watched it again and still made it to class the next morning - hahaha. I already feel transformations happening within my own acting process and was able to immediately apply the things I learned. ""Awake and Dream"" is a juicy, tangible, visceral and organic approach to the art of acting. She is practicle, to the point, no fluff!  And wow what a presence.
A must see for any actor on any level~
ENJOY!!",1050537600,,1001,4.530386740331492
