8065986,1,B0009S4J5A,"Avia (Avia Richards ) is a vampire hunter or just bat s@#t crazy. She meets a cop (Rodney Jackson) who she confides her story of vampires and all he wants to do is play astronaut and have his Tang. Avia has flashbacks and we the audience must decide what is real and what is not.

The film starts off with ""Omen"" style music, and then bounces all over the place, even playing Arabian music as Avia works out with her Samurai sword, or whatever that was. In fact the music got dramatic for things like walking, entering a house, and looking down a pipe with a flashlight. I don't believe the makers of the film quite grasped the idea behind a soundtrack. The acting was bad. The dialogue was uninteresting. The camera work was shaky and frequently cut off the tops of heads. The sound was also choppy.

What really made the film unbelievable was that the white cop was better dressed than the black cop. When was the last time the white cop looked sharper in the movie.

There is one love scene, or something that implied one. No nudity or swearing. Qualifies for a punch on the hacker card for those that can make it all the way through without using the fast forward or jumping ahead.",1454025600,,1185,4.401826484018265

It is the worst movie, if you can call it that, that I have ever seen!!! If I knew before hand, you couldn't give it to me free of charge.",1204070400,,297,3.983050847457627
