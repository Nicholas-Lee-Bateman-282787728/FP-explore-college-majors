7997359,4,B0000AISI7,"This show was dated, but the writing was very good. I thought that Ronnie Barker's comedic timing was wonderful. I have always been a David Jason fan, so it was fun to see him in this as well. After seeing the ""pilot"" I am glad they replaced the original actress with Lynda Baron. She seemed to bring a lot more warmth to the role and her timing was also very well done. I also liked many of the returning 'customers' and recognized a few familiar faces.",1302307200,,454,4.290697674418604
