8151866,3,B000JLTSDK,"Aside from the ethical questions involved in the creation of this documentary, it actually proves to be of great interest, certainly to the psychologically -minded ones among us, as well as the viewer who can identify with the main ""character's"" obsession with, of all people, the actress Natalie Portman. The two documentarians, who instigated the cross country car trip, and who drove the impaired (for lack of a better word) young man from California to Boston in order to film him when he finally met the most important person in his life, have used him for their advancement, however only one of them is now alive to reap whatever benefits which may or may not come.
The revelation of events on the trip will repulse and/or fascinate you, so be prepared for an extraordinary experience. Give particular attention to two of the 'participants'...the father and ""Elle""...both of them very subtly demonstrate, at least to my mind, perhaps the strangest ones of all!",1257033600,,966,4.969135802469136
8151867,5,B000JLTSDK,"This is one of the few films I've seen that made me second-guess my reaction to it, and I think that's why I like it so much.  It's definitely an experimental project, they play around with the boundries of fiction and documentary, but it's a very interesting portrait of a troubled person.  I loved the main character, despite his flaws, he's charming and strange.  I'm looking forward to seeing more films like this.",1167091200,3,418,4.698630136986301
