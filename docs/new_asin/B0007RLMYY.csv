The DVD itself is high quality all the way featuring an avalanche of insane lighter tricks. Thanks to the multiple angles + walkthrough and slomo, learning the tricks is pretty easy. I would recommend this title to anyone!",1112140800,14,498,4.847058823529411
8050988,5,B0007RLMYY,i purchased this dvd to learn some cool tricks but later to realize this dvd became my new favorite thing to watch i still don't know how to do these tricks because alas i have no hands but its still cool to watch at home,1498089600,,221,3.933333333333333
8050989,5,B0007RLMYY,This is basically just a collection of ways to make your zippo lighter a conversation piece. It's fun!!,1481500800,,103,4.777777777777778

8050992,5,B0007RLMYY,I saw some other reviews complaining about this disk and I can honestly say that they are either too lazy to practice or visually impaired. I have never come accross such a large collection of zippo tricks on one single disk. They are easy to learn for manipulators of all stages and very well filmed. There are close up's and slow motion shots which will guide you step by step on how to perform these moves. Go ahead and get this disk if you are tired of only knowing one way to light the zippo.,1408838400,2,497,4.242105263157895
8050993,4,B0007RLMYY,"I bought this dvd, and i gotta say i was a little disapointed at first as they didn't go into any real detail about any of the tricks, but it was still good, all i recomend is that you have some more zippo lighter cases on hand as these tricks take a toll on the hinges, maybe 3 or 4 practice cases and 1 case for when doing these tricks in public",1400025600,,347,3.8333333333333335
8050994,2,B0007RLMYY,The transaction went without a hitch but the DVD was a joke but not the sellers fault....All in all A+ to the seller Thanks,1243555200,,123,4.166666666666667
8050995,1,B0007RLMYY,i borrow this video from a friend and i didn't learn a thing. i watched it like 4 times at least and its just a horrible instructional video. but if u really want to waste ur time and money  go ahead and buy it,1222128000,,210,3.772727272727273
8050996,5,B0007RLMYY,"thought it was a bit high of a price, but i wanted to do something neat with my extra time.  I bought this vid, borrowed some friends zippos (pretty much must be zippo) and had a couple down in the first day.  While i thought the ones at the beggining were a joke, i realized later theres some impossible ones.  I musta popped in the dvd 6 times since i bought it, but i know a good 10 tricks.  Their not EXPERT or AMAZING, but i can impress my friends with some neat ones i learned.  If u have a zippo, do some sweet things with it.",1221868800,7,533,3.94392523364486
8050997,5,B0007RLMYY,This is the best educational DVD I have ever purchased. Everything is great quality and the way the tricks are filmed makes it easy to learn. Thanks to this DVD I'm now a Zen master of Zippo Tricks!,1127952000,9,198,4.2368421052631575
