1986453,5,B0001BKBGG,"The armour alone is worth getting this DVD.  All types of late period armour are present in this film and for the most part it is historically accurate.  The exception being when they winch our fair hero into the saddle.  This story is excellent, the riddles complex, and the action scenes great.  Especially for the time the movie was made.  I recomend it to all SCA folks out there and all families who want a jolly good show.",1079913600,6,428,4.435897435897436
1986454,3,B0001BKBGG,Sword of the Valiant is an attempt at a literal adaptation of one of the most truly bizarre and surreal epic poems to come out of medieval Europe; one full of symbolism never meant to be taken literally; with too small of a budget to pull it off.  Try picturing Terry Gilliam's Baron Munchausen without any of Gilliam's panache.  Watching this when I was a young kid while I was home with a fever gave me a good idea of what a drug trip must be like.

1986471,3,B0001BKBGG,"Watched this movie last night.  I think their goal was to capture the same audience that loved 1981's ""Excalibur.""  And to be honest, they might have succeeded...they really did line up a stunning cast, gorgeous sets and costumes, etc.  It didn't really hit the mark, though, although on the whole I found it pleasant enough.

I did find it distracting at first (being a history buff) that the armor, clothing, etc. was all from the 14th century (the ""high"" Middle Ages) rather than King Arthur's Dark Ages (right after the fall of Rome), but I got over that after a while.  After all, Hollywood is usually more concerned with what looks good over what is historically accurate.  What I couldn't get over was Sir Gawain's page-boy bouffant of golden locks...it was so obviously fake, and it made his face look dirty.  The music was also *hugely* distracting...I think that's really what spoiled for me, since it ruined the mood of many, many scenes.

On the whole...it's a corny romp good enough to while away a rainy afternoon or a late night when you can't sleep.",1309651200,,1065,4.718918918918919
1986472,3,B0001BKBGG,"Make no mistake about it, this is a crummy movie!  And yet, oddly endearing in its ineptitude.  It takes a combined effort to make something this terrible, to waste the talents of such luminaries as Trevor Howard, Peter Cushing, John Rhys-Davies, and Sean Connery, all in one sitting.  In this regard, they did a bang-up job, sparing no expense (one assumes the expenses, or expectations, weren't too high to begin with).
I guess this falls into the category of Sword & Sorcery for genre sake.  It starts with a challenge (some would say threat) from a Green Knight (Sean Connery) that Gawain (Miles O'Keeffe) accepts then quickly segues into another fight with a Black Knight who guards a city to nowhere.  Let's just cut to the chase and say there was a lot of running and fighting and running and more fighting (it was pretty disorganized).  You might even call this a road picture because it certainly wasn't much of a buddy flick (Gawain having lost his sidekick/servant early on in favor of a distressful damsel with one very big ring).  There's also a riddle I forgot instantly, a witch and a hag who stole Maleficent's headpiece, Sean Connery all a splendor in green and sparkles, some warring factions, Peter Cushing as a sage on the sidelines, a red Muppet-like frog, a horny prince (also a toad).  Think of it as a live action Fractured Fairytale and your head won't explode while you're trying to figure it all out.  Did I mention the unicorn?  At least there was a jolly tone throughout and the story fairly zipped along....it didn't make much sense but at least they were quick about it!  I especially liked the rack humor.  And the joust.

Would I ever watch it again?  Hey, I was stupid enough to watch it twice, that's my limit.
Not a keeper (so I won't be tempted to accidently watch it a third time).

And who names their kid Gawain?  Don't tell me he didn't have a hard time of it in knight school!",1309305600,,1918,4.564327485380117
1986473,4,B0001BKBGG,"It appears that the makers tried to eat their cake and have it, too: make a move that simple folk could take for a simple action/romance movie, while the more sophisticated adult viewers could see it as a rollicking, tongue-in-cheek Pythonesque burlesque of the overblown Arthurian epic.  That ambivalence is what keeps it at 4 stars, not 5: nowadays we realize that spoofing pastiches need not hide behind mock-seriousness, but they were more timid then.

Overall, the thing is very Pythonesque, and the viewer who understands that will get much joy out of it, while the viewer who wants Excalibur, or even just Prince Valiant, is left huffing and puffing at the perceived horridness of it all.

Have a drink or two, open your sensibilities, and settle back for an evening of guffaws and chortles.  (And a good part of the fun is recognizing character actors doing familiar shticks.)",1303430400,,884,4.912751677852349

1986475,1,B0001BKBGG,"Do not be misled by the cover art. Sean Connery has a relatively small role in this dreadful 1984 adaptation of ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight."" Nevertheless, Connery displays far more charisma in his limited footage than the film's wooden star, Miles O'Keeffe. The legendary actor earned a cool $1 million for six days' work on this cheesy Golan-Globus production. Despite Connery's presence, ""Sword of the Valiant"" never warranted a U.S. theatrical release and made its unceremonious home-video debut in 1985.",1289001600,6,513,5.2682926829268295

1986477,2,B0001BKBGG,"Have you ever watched Mystery Science Theater and wondered were do they find such horrible movies to make fun of? Well This could easliy be one of them, the first time I saw this film I'd  had a few drinks and my buddy and I were looking for something to watch on T.V. late at night. He was flipping threw the channels and I saw Sean Connery in what appeared to be a green seqence dress with horns coming out of his head??? Yeah, so we had to stay up and watch the whole thing. The story is about a king who is bored with his kingdom and knights and says his knights have no pride nor valor anymore and just as he says this in strolls Sean Connery as I described previously and challenges the kings knights for a feat of courage. Only Brave Sir Gawain, yes you read that right Gawain, Stands up to the challenge he looks like someone straight out of a 80's rock video mabe Poison or Whitesnake. the story goes on and is totaly absurd with magic and sorcery. My Favorite scene is When Brave Sir Gawain is challenged by the evil Black Knight and just as there about to fight the Black Knight rides away, it looks like the horse they used decided to just gallop away and the director didn't feel like saying cut. Then the Black Knight comes back and Anounces Oh We Shall Fight. This movie is only good if your looking for a movie sooo bad you can laugh at it.

Based on an Arthurian (and actually older) legend, it is an entertaining tale of chivalry, knighthood, passage rites, mystic happenings and a bit of the old Gods.

Connery appears as a central figure in the form of the old Celtic Green Man - or as so named in this film, the Green Knight.

1986482,2,B0001BKBGG,"This movie is best enjoyed with small children or drunks. The premise: A slightly homo-erotic-tailored Sean Connery as the green knight (think armored Zardoz) decides to challenge the nearby king's court to a game of wits and bravery. The challenge is answered by Sir Gawain, Miles O'Keeffe, whose ridiculous 80's hair stretches credulity more than the unicorns and witches. If you're prepared to laugh and enjoy the great overplayed soundtrack this film has to offer, like so many funnier repeats of the 1981 Excalibur, this is a movie for you.",1212451200,4,545,5.066666666666666
1986483,4,B0001BKBGG,"I first saw this production about twenty years ago, more or less.  I like the nod it gives to the celto/pagan elements of the tale.  The armour, while not probably what Arthur and his men may have worn, assuming they existed, and they may have, it is still in keeping with the traditional vision of what a knight looked like.  There is an interesting mix of romantic knighthood vs the bully-thug with the sword.  The behavior was, perhaps somewhere in the middle.  The sound effects and special effects are a little dated, but, well, it is about twenty years old.  The Green Knight's axe looks sharp and deadly, but the effect is ruined by the jetcraft sounding noise which whirrs as Connery swings it about.  I strongly recommend this for any language arts instructor teaching the Arthuriad or mythology.

1986484,2,B0001BKBGG,"This is a very silly but somewhat enjoyable fantasy movie, starring Miles O'Keeffe (in a very bad wig) as Sir Gawain. Muscle man O'Keeffe is helped by a strong supporting cast, including Sean Connery (in a smaller part than you'd expect from a title character, and an even worse wig), Lila Kedrova, Peter Cushing and John Rhys-Davies. The movie has a paper thin plot and bad special effects. Don't expect a quality movie, but seen as campy entertainment, it almost works.

The DVD is very bad. From a major studio like MGM, I would have expected better. The movie is meant to be shown with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, but this release (except for the opening credits) is badly pan and scanned, and there's very few scenes that don't suffer greatly from it. The action scenes are especially bad but also some dialogue scenes look awful, with half of each characters head cut out. I found this cheap and I would not advice anyone to pay the full price for such a bad DVD. But if you really want to see the movie, try to see if you can find a cheap copy.",1202256000,,1046,4.419689119170984

1986488,1,B0001BKBGG,"The film did not follow the literature at all.  The only section that was unscathed was the very beginning when the Green Knight first makes the challenge.  From then on Hollywood made their own story, theme, morals, etc.",1175040000,3,221,4.7894736842105265
1986489,2,B0001BKBGG,"The only real draw here is Sean Connery, but he's on screen relatively little, and not in his greatest role. Most of the time, it's a badly-bewigged Gawain running around in white tights.

1986491,2,B0001BKBGG,"Sub-par adaptation of the immortal medieval classic, SIR GAWAIN AND THE GREEN KNIGHT.  The high point of the movie comes early, when the mysterious Green Knight (essayed by Sean Connery)barges into King Arthur's court and offers a bizarre behading challenge to the astonished Knights of the Round Table.  Only the young Gawain (played by Miles O'Keefe) will accept the challenge and strikes off the Green Knight's head.  But to Gawain's amazement the Green Knight picks up his head and puts it back on, and Gawain is honor-bound to offer his own throat to the challenger's axe.  The Green Knight gives Gawain a year to prepare and a riddle to solve, however,and for the rest of the movie we follow Gawain's adventures in love & war as he struggles to interpret the riddle and prepare for the final showdown with the Green Knight.

Unfortunately, most of the movie is unremarkable, to say the least.  O'Keefe is an acceptable Gawain and you couldn't ask for a better actor to play the Green Knight than Connery, but the lackluster script and direction, combined with what must have been a sorry budget, doom their efforts and those of everyone else involved in the film.  Sets and costumes are adequate, but the plot is convoluted and rather boring and not at all faithful to the great source poem.  Indeed, much of the plot is apparently inspired by the tale of Gawain's cousin, Yvain, instead. The climax makes little sense and betrays the original tale, while the ending is supposed to be melancholy but just disappoints like so much of the rest of this film. Perhaps worth a look for curiosity's sake or for the very good first act if you don't expect too much.",1167177600,12,1664,4.73356401384083
1986492,1,B0001BKBGG,"I am somewhat ambivalent about my rating - as an example of truly bad film, it is worthy of many, many stars. While there are still some vestiges of the original story of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, it is a preposterous mish-mash of every medieval movie cliche imaginable.  Dreadful dialogue, atrocious acting, and a confusing, if not schizophrenic story  line.  Watch it only if drunk, high, or with friends who enjoy the worst in film.

Utterly awful no matter how you slice this one; Costumes, scenery, script...terrible...and the music/soundtrack (if you can call it that) sounded a recording of a 12-year old fiddling around with an old Casio keyboard, then dropped in a tub of water for a few weeks of warping before being added to the sound reels.......Connery must have been drinking heavily when he accepted this script....I'm sure after seeing the finished product, he regretted doing this film.

Well anyway this film tells the tale of Sir Gwain and the Green Knight in a pretty straight forward play of events. The synthesized music was what drew me in even though it's mildly cheesy. This film was overlooked I guess by MST3K but it's really not a bad movie. It's just something to watch while doing laundry.

8009773,5,B0001BKBGG,"Wow, I love this story, and I was fascinated at how closely it follows the real story of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. The costumes and hairstyles are just excellent, and the soundtrack is really catchy. I held a tape player up to the TV back in the early 90s when this was playing on TV and I still listen to the tape in my car. In fact, it's the last new music I have listened to, and I play the whole thing every day. I have this movie on VHS, which the video store owner just gave to me FOR FREE when the store closed 15 years ago. The owner, Dave, said that I rented it so many times that he wanted me to have it.

I really don't understand why so many people are down on this movie. It is a really fun adventure story, with romance, daring escapes, cool hair, horses and a feast where the food just looks so delicious. I wish that I could wear tights like that and gnaw on a big mutton shank. . . Sweeeeeeet!",1475798400,,917,3.983695652173913

8009776,3,B0001BKBGG,"Sword of the Valiant - The Legend of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is a film that you want to love with all your heart, but it doesn't quite hit that mark.

I remember first seeing this film in the 80's when it aired on of one of the cable channels. Back then I was  into Medieval/Fantasy films like Beast Master, Conan, Legend, Excalibur and The Sword and the Sorcerer. This film fell in nicely with those titles, and I remembered thinking, even back then, that it probably wasn't a high production value film. But at least it had Sean Connery in it, along with a few other actors, that I liked and had seen in other movies. Well the 80's have past now and I've grown older and wiser. After viewing Sword of the Valiant last night with my daughter, who is going to be in a play based on Sir Gawain, I can see how this film is not one of the best from its genre. However, I still think it has some good points to it and I'll make a list of the reasons why it still deserves three stars.

Number one, there are several well respected actors in this film including Sean Connery as the Green Knight, Miles O'Keeffe, (Gawain) John Ryes Davies, (The Baron) Peter Cushing, (The Baron's Advisor) Trevor Howard (Gawain's King) and an actor who shows up in a lot of films as a villain, but doesn't get much credit for it. Ronald Lacey, who plays Oswald, Gawain's competing nemesis for Lilith. I found Ronald Lacey to be one of the best characters in the story. In fact, I  thought that when I first viewed this movie years ago. I still think he's one of the best characters in the film today. He really brings Oswald alive and knows how to be the kind of guy you love to hate.

Beyond the acting, the costumes are well done. I also liked the fantasy elements. Granted they aren't spectacular by today's standards, but they help create a fantasy atmosphere nonetheless. There are also a couple of jousting battles that happen in the movie that are impressive, considering the film had a low budget. And one of the areas that always stood out to me in this particular movie was the soundtrack. It was done solely on synthesizers, but it had a very Medieval flare to it. Not quite as sophisticated as the U.S version of Legend, starring Tom Cruise. But the soundtrack in this film helps to create a fantasy atmosphere that sets you back in the time of Gawain. It might be the main reason why I still like the film today.

But to be fair, I think the film also suffers from several problems. Number one, the plot gets a bit convoluted. Granted, I didn't notice that about this story when I first viewed it in the 80's. But I can see it clearly now. It tries a little too hard to be a fantasy adventure, but doesn't have the budget to explore it. The action comes across dated and some of the dialogue could have been better. However, since most of the actors are true and tested, they make it all work somehow. And this complaint is solely a technical one. I don't know why the film was panned and scanned after the opening sequence. It remained in widescreen while the names of the actors were being displayed. After the opening however, the screen shrinks. It should have been left in widescreen the whole time for the DVD release. Its a failing of the 80s and early 90s video rental market that did that to this film. People had smaller TV screens back then, so the films were cropped to make the film appear larger at home. Now it's like an old bad habit that keeps creeping back up, on films that came out before the widescreen format became standard. And that's a shame.  Widescreen might have made this particular film appear better to the viewer.

Anyway, to tie things up, Sword of the Valiant isn't one of those types of movies that's a career maker for anyone. It was a film that primarily tapped into the fantasy craze of the 80's and brought a different medieval tale to life. So for that I think it deserves some credit. If you've never seen it, you might be disappointed with it. But if you look at it from the time it came from, along with some of the other movies from its genre, you might appreciate it more. There are some good points in this film, if you look for them.",1462579200,,4178,4.347435897435897
