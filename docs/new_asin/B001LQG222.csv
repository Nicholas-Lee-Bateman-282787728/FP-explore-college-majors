8319426,5,B001LQG222,"This set is filled with very practical and straightforward advice for couples whether the relationship is in trouble or not. We can all use better communication practices and Smalley creates light hearted anecdotes that relate to everyone.  Especially Tape No. 1 when he talks about the effects of oestrogen and testosterone - my husband and I laugh every time we watch it.  From an Australian point of view though the absolute beginning is a little sweet for us (honour between partners), so we start at about 19 minutes in and then run to the end and start again - then it all makes sense.  Must be because we are down under!  We often use this tape with our ADHD adult support group when partners talk about difficulties in relationships.  It is just great to see the eyes widen and they begin to realise that ADHD or not, they may well have experienced difficulties. The topics covered are very relevant to most marriages at some time or other.  Being prepared in this easy non threatening way, makes communication and opening up troublesome subjects less stressful.",1287964800,,1070,4.788043478260869
