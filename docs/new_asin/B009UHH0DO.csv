8544409,5,B009UHH0DO,"This is one of the best TV series I have seen.  The characters are terrific, the actors are great.  I started watching it just for something different than the usual detective shows (sorry DCI Banks), and I got immediately hooked.  I binge watched every night until I saw them all.  Just wonderful to see all the African animals and the characters' interaction with them.  The storylines really hook you in.  A great family show, a great anybody show.",1399852800,,451,4.717948717948718

8544412,5,B009UHH0DO,"Great family entertainment! Characters are very believable, awesome cinematography. I enjoyed the wild animals and African landscape very much too!",1371340800,,147,6.4
8544413,5,B009UHH0DO,"The first season was good, but this show just kept getting better and better.  Not only the development of the characters and the story, but the photography improved as well over the course of the 7 years.  I'm so fascinated by Africa and this really lit the flame. Plus I have always been a big Hayley Mills fan and was delighted to find her inserted into the drama.  I discovered this series on Netflix and was hooked.  It was like reading a really good book.  I just couldn't wait to see what happened next.  I loved all the characters, people and animals.  I developed a real affection for ""poor old Anders.""  He's such a great combination of sly fox, devoted friend, and wacky sidekick.  I wish i had a friend like him.  I have been searching everywhere for the Season 7 Christmas special that was the actual wrap up/ending of the series.  I've heard Liv gets married and I would love to see it. ( I won't say to whom so it won't spoil it for those who don't know the end.)  Well Done BBC.  Well done cast and crew.  I would love to have a adventure like theirs.",1368230400,7,1067,4.296482412060302
8544414,5,B009UHH0DO,I came upon this series by chance. I watched all the seasons  and till want more. It s a wonderful show and ill watch it again and again. Everyone should have it in their library. Great show!!!!!!,1365984000,2,196,4.297297297297297
8544415,5,B009UHH0DO,would really like to see more series like this.the u.s doesn't put as much heart into their shows as the bbc does.,1363651200,,114,4.2272727272727275
8544416,4,B009UHH0DO,"I enjoyed the first 6 series of ""Wild at Heart"" as well as series 7.  Africa provides a beautiful setting for the complete series. The characters , both human and animal, keep your interest and leave you wanting more and waiting for the next series.
My only disappointment  with the 7th series was the absence of Alice (Dawn Steele). However, I understand the circumstances for her being written out of most of the last series.  I certainly recommend this series for delightful entertainment .",1358553600,4,493,4.845238095238095
