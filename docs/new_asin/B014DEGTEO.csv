7385787,1,B014DEGTEO,Waste of time,1440806400,,13,3.6666666666666665
7385788,1,B014DEGTEO,The last time I was this pissed off at the end of a movie was X-Men: The Last Stand (3).,1440806400,,88,3.45
7385789,4,B014DEGTEO,"Assuming this was just going to be a reimagining of the 1985 Kiwi film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Quiet-Earth/dp/B000EZ908Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Quiet Earth</a>&nbsp;(based on a 1981 science fiction novel of the same name), I was relieved to discover that Z for Zachariah isn't rehashing The Quiet Earth but is instead based on an even older book (you guessed it:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Z-for-Zachariah/dp/1416939210/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Z for Zachariah</a>, 1974).

Similar to the recent movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Air/dp/B013GZW97C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Air</a>, Zachariah is another case study of 2 or 3 individuals and what it means to be alone in the world versus *almost* alone in the world. The acting in Zachariah is remarkable, which is of paramount importance in a character-driven film. A simple plot is suitable; there was no reason to go beyond the profound meanings of being the only people alive. The soundtrack is perfect, adding icing to an already tasty cake.

Like The Quiet Earth (TQE), Zachariah is a ""last remaining boy meets last remaining girl"" story complicated by a ""wait, there's actually another boy too"" scenario. Although a cerebral movie, Z for Zachariah pushes a restrained but hardly unbroken tension for its duration. In ways, this existential uncertainty is as impactful as something like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Walking-Dead/dp/B0049VZ2UY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Walking Dead</a>, with a different but no less potent sense of urgency since changes in group dynamics are greater in magnitude when fewer characters are alive. Both Z for Zachariah and Z for Zombies (The Walking Dead) bring up the finer points of ""cooperate or die,"" but in Zachariah the common enemy element is absent (no zombies to contend with, just avoid radiation and you're all set), so the focus is completely on how the human race might continue in an arbitrary tribe of 3.

If you want closure, watch Air instead, or even TQE (come to think of it, watch TQE no matter what). If you simply want a thought-provoking 95 minutes with an earnest and engaging story, then give Z for Zachariah a chance.",1440806400,20,2346,6.212307692307692

There would be some connection to the biblical names perhaps, or the religious angle, the lost brother, or John's atheism, or the apparent betrayal of John, but ... nothing. She had sex with someone else. John said ""It's ok"" and the movie ended. At the very least, I expected the camera to sweep out over the valley at the end and we'd see the other guy's dead body at the bottom of the ravine. But, nope. Nothing. What a waste.

7385804,4,B014DEGTEO,"A slow-burning, intimate look at the tension between instinct and ethics in an apocalyptic landscape. Wrapped up in this ""love & survival triangle"" are serious questions such as What is sacred? What is worth sacrificing? Do morals matter in the face of death/extinction?

I enjoyed the performances of all three actors, but Chiwetel Ejiofor's character definitely stands out from the others as being the most nuanced. As a viewer you sympathize and dislike him in turns, and by the end you are left with a perfect ambivalent mixture of both sentiments. Such complexity may in fact be what has caused other reviews here to incorrectly deem the movie ""racist"". And while such an interpretation is so far from the truth it's almost laughable, I suppose if you are the type of person who prefers PoC to only play insipid and uninteresting characters, you can consider this your trigger warning and know that this film is -not- for you.

Although far from perfect and somewhat unsatisfactory, ""Z For Zachariah"" is well acted, shot beautifully, and the questions it raises stick with you for some time after watching. Definitely worth a viewing.",1500854400,4,1139,4.989473684210527

7385808,3,B014DEGTEO,"Supposedly, the movie is set in what is probably West Virginia after a nuclear incident.  There the unanswered questions and inconsistencies begin.

Anne (Australian Margot Robbie) lives with her dog on her family farm.  She sounds like she is always about to lose her voice.

Loomis (African Brit Chiwetel Ejiofor) shows up one day in an improvised spacesuit dragging what looks like a dumpster that's been converted into a type of camper.  He seems a bit touched.  Loomis had been a mile underground in some U.S. government bunker for scientists and politicians.  Why Loomis left that bunkers is never really explained.

Caleb (Chris Pine, the only American) later shows up.  Caleb is handsome and charming, instantly a threat to Loomis and of interest to Anne.  Caleb was working in a coal mine 50 miles away and has only just come above ground.

Loomis decides to build a waterwheel to generate electricity, but he insists he has to use the wood from the chapel Anne's father built.  Loomis needs Caleb's and Anne's help with this project.

Now the inconsistencies.  These three ""Americans"" hold their eating utensils like Europeans.  Caleb and Anne supposedly only lived 50 miles from each other, but she has a thick accent and he doesn't.

Anne's parents left her alone on the farm with 13 years old brother so they could go look for survivors.  Huh?  Then her brother left in search for their parents leaving her alone with the dog.  After Caleb shows up the dog seems to disappear.

None of them talk much about what happened.  No one asks why.  All very strange.

The movie ends inconclusively.  You have to believe the worse about one of two characters. Why either one would have done that is inconceivable.",1499904000,,1717,4.821305841924398

The movie has little to do with the novel but becomes a tense romantic triangle amidst quiet survival horror. Casting Chiwetel Ejiofer as the main character adds an uncomfortable racial tension that the movie doesn't shy away from as we find out what really happens when two men decide to fight over the last woman. The last moments of the film are not as ambiguous as some feel, but do raise a lot of uncomfortable and unanswered questions.",1499558400,,572,4.617647058823529

7385815,2,B014DEGTEO,"Super predictable. Wasn't a single moment when I didn't know that was going to happen next.  Which, isn't alway a bad thing, but it's like the makers said, go small or go home.  If you are going to be ambitious enough to make a ""thriller"" that isn't afraid to kill its darlings, then at least do it in a big, original, or compelling way.  But, each of the pivotal moments either happened offscreen, or ended with a whimper.  The one thing they did right was the sexual tension between Chris Pine and Margot Robbie.  In fact, the entire movie picked up once he showed up. The way he looks at her when they are swimming in the creek (with those big, piercing, anime eyes)....I almost fainted.  The attraction was palpable.  But I attribute that moment of genius squarely to Chris Pine.  Either you got it or you don't, and my man got it.",1497916800,,835,4.411764705882353

7385817,4,B014DEGTEO,"After reading many positive and negative reviews, I was interested in watching this film.  Some people complained that it was slow and was not an action/adventure movie.  So I was expecting a rather dull film.  However, happily I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  The setting and plot was very interesting, how some people dealt with life after  proabably a world war, or some kind of destruction that left many dead and people had died and/or were sickened by radioactivity. But there was this valley that was somewhat uneffected and a woman and two men were able to survive and make their life in this setting bearable.  This film is not as depressing as The Road, another very thought provoking film.  This film was not just about survival, it was also a love story and I think all three actors did a fabulous job in the movie.  To all those negative reviews, I disagree.  It does have a quiet steady pace, but keeps you interested, I think, all the way through.",1497052800,4,983,4.603448275862069

7385821,4,B014DEGTEO,"Solid acting all around. It is pretty clear that there was a nuclear war or severe nuclear incident that at least had an effect on North America. Margot's character is surviving alone on the family farm up until she runs into Loomis who is played by Ejiofor.  Loomis is intelligent, but has a dark side to him. Margot and Eijofor become emotionally involved and it only gets more complicated when Chris Pines' character arrives on the scene.
Even though there are large holes in the story line that are better explained in the book, most viewers should be able to connect the dots.",1496102400,,581,4.640776699029126
7385822,4,B014DEGTEO,"I remember reading the book this was based on about 15-20 years ago and enjoying it very much--enough that scenes have stuck with me since then. From what I recall, the adaptation is fairly true to the story to start, but deviates with the addition of a third person--Caleb--and some tweaks to Loomis's past which ended up reframing most of the conflict in the book into a love triangle and lessens  the morality conflict significantly. That weakening and the ending were the changes which I disliked -- much preferred how it played out in the novel. There is not a lot of action in the movie (or the book), and a good deal of the background is left to inference.

The title f the novel comes from a reference to a Bible ABC book. In the novel, there is an inner monologue towards the beginning where Ann contemplates that if Adam is the first man on earth, Zachariah should be the last. (That's one of the things that stuck with me from the novel.) This is alluded to in the movie once with a shot of the book and the page about Adam. Without that context, the title probably seems very random. Other pieces that stayed with me and seemed consistent:
-the gas station scene
-why the valley was protected
-the suit (though I keep conflating Loomis's gadgetry with Jeebee's from Wolf and Iron)",1496016000,,1292,4.517094017094017

7385833,5,B014DEGTEO,"If you need action, car chases, and an ending that ties it all up in a bow, this isn't your movie. (Don't be fooled: the movie description's use of the words ""intense thriller"" is completely misleading.) But if you like character pieces, and ""thinky"" movies, this might be your flick.  Set in the aftermath of some kind of (nuclear?) apocalypse, the story is more about human nature than survival, dealing with existential questions (Is life worth living if one is the only person left? Why and how do we keep on living?), faith, relationships, and ethics.  If you like movies like ""Force Majeure"" and TV like ""Rectify"" and ""The OA,"" you might like this one.",1495756800,,658,4.71304347826087

7385835,1,B014DEGTEO,"I very much wanted to like this movie. There is so much potential for the story and characters. Unfortunately, it does not deliver anything but an incredibly slow pace and unanswered questions. Who is Zachariah? What caused the holocaust? What happened to Caleb? Are there other survivors? What happened to the dog? Do they survive the following winter? Equally disappointing is character development which is weak and confused. For example, Chiwetel Ejiofor's character (John Loomis) who survived more than a year with his ""safe suit"" and Geiger counter ignores both and jumps into a radioactive pond. How could he be so stupid? Character driven drama is as lifeless as most of the planet because it appears the director couldn't make up his mind where he wanted to go. Instead, he teases the audience with the beginnings of several possible storylines none of which get finished. You have to decide for yourself what happens. Also, the relationship between Loomis and Margot Robbie's character is never clear enough for the arrival of Caleb (Chris Pine) to inject anything into the mix.

7386129,3,B014DEGTEO,"Z is a novel by Robert C. O'Brien (pen name of Robert Leslie Conly) that was published posthumously in 1974.
The novel and movie are passed off as original, but in fact the 1959 movie ""The World, The Flesh & The Devil"" starring Harry Belafonte, Inger Stevens & Mel Ferrer is almost the same thing, only better, IMHO, although I do like the modern cinematic update of this previously told story.
I don't understand why the author never gave the original any credit (although in his defense, he did pass away before it was completed) but the movie producers of this ""remake"" could have given the original a nod, but I guess they didn't want to spend any money in acknowledgements.
The cast of both productions perform above average in their respective roles. I think the original is required viewing for anyone interested in this version, or this genre in general.

What we know for sure is that almost everyone on earth is dead and that radiation continues to be dangerous.  But enough said about that.  The film's charm comes from the delicate acting of the three people in the film and the tension built up by the careful direction by Craig Zobel, a new director that grandly displays his chops here.
  Australian beauty Margot Robbie continues her career as a movie star with this measured role.  We know she is an actress as well as a star and this film confirms it.  Chris Pine and Chiwetel Cjiofor play two other survivors who vie for what for all they know is the last woman on earth.  Cjiofor plays a scientist who woos too  while Pine plays a coal miner, a younger, more vigorous and more aggressive man.  What plays out amounts to a dread filled drama about a love triangle.
  Or is it something else entirely.  Is the scientist a man of such complete self control that he can plan his moves so far ahead that none of the others even know that there is a game about?  We don't know, even after the film is over.  And isn't it a compliment to a film maker that after the show we can continue to talk about the film and speculate?

7386655,3,B014DEGTEO,"It's a good thing that there weren't three people in the Garden of Eden, or else none of us might be around today. Love triangles seem to have been around since the time of the Garden, but the one in ""Z for Zachariah"" takes on special significance, since the two men competing for the affection of the same woman in this post-nuclear apocalyptic tale may very well be the last three people alive on Earth.

""Z for Zachariah"" is based on a 1970's YA novel by Robert O'Brien, but the film differs significantly from the book (which only had two characters) and, in fact, seems more like a loose remake of a significantly better 1950's film that covered the same general subject matter, ""The World, the Flesh and the Devil."" In the current movie, the world has supposedly been decimated by a nuclear holocaust, but all viewers get to see in ""Zachariah""'s 95 minutes is an incredibly idyllic, rustic Appalachian valley that's somehow immune to the radiation. Ann Burden (Margot Robbie) has lived on a farm in that valley her entire life and still runs the farm well enough to keep herself fed. Her solitary existence is disrupted by the arrival of two strangers, first an engineer, John Loomis (Chiwetel Ejiofor,) and, later, a miner, Caleb (Chris Pine), both of whom had been underground since the catastrophe. Although the three try to act civilized about the entire matter, both men wind up vying for Ann's attention.

For an end-of-the-world film, Zachariah is surprisingly low key. There are no mutants or zombies or ruthless mobs of skinhead warriors running around; in fact, other than some high radiation readings in an early scene in which Loomis accidentally bathes in a contaminated spring, no signs of anything other than a near bucolic paradise. And thats part of the problem. Everything, including the actors, who have movie-star looks (Robbie tries to look a bit plain but never manages it), just looks far too good to have been through a nuclear disaster. In The World, the Flesh, and the Devil, the deserted streets of New York City were a constant reminder that something was very wrong; here, everything looks very right.

Beneath this idyllic surface, however, director Craig Zobel and the actors create some intriguing conflicts. In addition to the obvious sexual tension, and the equally obvious racial tension (which is there, but less of a concern to the characters than it was in the original), there is the tension based on age, as the clearly older Loomis worries and wonders if Ann will find the younger Caleb a better catch. And there is the age-old tension about science and religion. The devout (and virginal) Ann has been rather accepting of what has happened, but Loomis, a scientist, is more concerned about the long term and has ideas for restoring power that involve a major sacrifice on Anns part.

These tensions are all on display, although rarely openly. The script has minimal dialogue, and the pace of the movie is quite slow, so its left to the actors to carry the weight. Fortunately, all three are up to the task, especially Ejiofor, who has the most complex role. Still, despite the performances, the film often seems to drag, as Zobel is preoccupied with scenes such as a lengthy montage about the construction of a waterwheel for power. The films ending, however, is quite a stunner, especially for its abruptness, so much so that some viewers will want to replay it to be sure they didn't miss anything.

Overall, Z for Zachariah is decent entertainment, primarily for the actors performances and the relatively interesting premise. Yet it feels like a giant missed opportunity, less like any end-of-the-world film Ive ever seen and more like a threesome in paradise dating reality show. Im giving the film a marginal recommendation, but viewers really interested in this films concept should check out the superior The World, the Flesh and the Devil..",1474675200,,3897,4.880664652567976

The viewer is never really told exactly what happens. As the movie starts getting more interesting as the characters start really developing the movie ends...Maybe those types of movies do it for you in which case you will love it.,1474243200,,364,4.615384615384615

Apparently, the ""Big Bomb"" went off and all the people that had no protection eventually died.  Only a few were left and this was the story of how they came to live together and start repopulating the world.

7387291,3,B014DEGTEO,"Here's a melodrama that could play out on stage with no more set than a piece of rope and a bathroom basin -- those two props are the pivotal moments in a tragedy of greed and lust with the superfluous context of a world in ruins and radioactive contamination.  Numerous elements of the story are put in place and go unused and ignored -- this is not a technically sophisticated story, it's not a deeply researched examination, it's not a study in psychology (though it purports to start out on each of those, only to seemingly forget it started the sentence) and it ends without ever framing a real question or delivering the satisfaction of an answer.
I think this is a story that deserves a better rendition in film, less style, fewer millions in the paychecks, more minutes of the screen time invested in the characters, less in the time-wasting of a tractor plowing a field -- how more straightforward and literal can you get than the time-wasting of a tractor plowing a field?
The writing excels in moving the pieces of the characters' personalities in and out of trust, in and out of trial by ordeal, in and out of the connections and conflicts of life.  The story seems powerful, but feebly done in this movie.  A pity.  I  think the story showed real potential.
The actors are accomplished and skilled but this movie does not exhibit their abilities; type cast, they are not, those the beauty of the leading woman is unmistakable, yet the director chose to gratuitously undress her, and that mistake came early and misdirected expectations with tedious attempts at sexual tension.
By all means, play it one evening and expect to be entertained, if not wowed.  I look forward to the next work from all three actors, but somewhere in the team of people writing and filming this movie, a lot of very capable people in the movie industry put together a high powered yawner.",1473379200,,1878,4.658610271903323

Really though, I felt those issues actually helped focus on the character stories and interactions. This was by far the strength.

They are struggling to survive during a post-apocolyptic event.  What happened is not clear, but it is said that it is radiological in nature and somehow this little valley is spared from most of the fallout.

The movie has only three characters.  One is ""Ann"" who lives on her family's property and is all who remains after this event.  The others are ""John"" and ""Caleb.""  John and Anne for all intents and purposes are the last two people on earth, begin to build a life together.  Caleb then appears somewhere near the property after claiming to be underground during the events.  The film concentrates not on the nuclear event, but on the dynamic that exists between these people who all share love, jealousy, hatred, loss, among other feelings.

7387608,5,B014DEGTEO,"This was a great movie.  Although its never directly stated, it is inferred that a nationwide (perhaps worldwide) nuclear explosion has occurred.  I had to watch the film several times to grasp all the indoor footage since it is necessarily shadowy (only candle light - no electricity) or perhaps its the color adjustment on my TV.  At any rate, the setting is a farm in a beautiful valley in what I suspected was to represent rural Virginia.  The father, who never actually appears in the movie, is said to be the minister of the local country church, and it is inferred that his farm and the valley was spared from nuclear destruction by the grace of God.  Only a young Christian woman (the farmer's daughter - approx. age 18?) and her dog is left alone to run the farm while her remaining family members search for survivors.  At the opening of the movie, six months or so has passed without their return.  Eventually, a scientist emerges from an underground bunker in DC and braves the radioactivity to find the valley.  Then a (West Virginia?) coal miner, who also survived the tragedy by being underground, drifts into the area...the last three people on earth(?)  The very realistic problem solving of plowing and planting without tractor fuel as well as finding a source for electricity to operate the freezers for the winter food storage begins.  Then the predictable rivalry between the two men in an unspoken challenge over the girl arises.  The only unlikely problem I found was the girl's sudden behavioral change.  At the beginning, she is a proper, obedient Christian girl, very mature in her domestic responsibilities and all sweetness and light.  Suddenly, she does a 180 in her moral behavior, which I found impractical and confusing.  Frankly, I expected the men to be the ones making the sexual advancements.  But one minute shes devotedly playing religious music on the church organ, praying and defending her Christian faith, and then the next moment shes all but jumping in bed with the men.  However, I suppose being left all alone for six months or so with the assumption that your family will never return, and believing that you're only one of three humans left on the face of the earth would create a serious conflict in your mind.  In any case, it is a fast paced film, realistically thought out and that holds your interest all the way to the end.  Actually, I could envision a sequel as other survivors of the catastrophe slowly begin to emerge from shelters and find their way into the valley, something along the lines of the Walking Dead.",1472947200,,2572,4.767494356659142

The actors performance was good but movie was bad.  I'm getting tired of movies being made ""based"" on the book and not being anything like the book.  I read the book when I was a kid in 1975.  Thought it was great and really excited that a movie was made of it.  Then VERY disappointed after watching it.  I know I should have learned my lesson after Hollywood changed the ending of Stephen King's Cujo where the child lived instead of dying like the book but hope is everlasting (or am I a glutton for punishment) as I recently watched the movie Allegiant.

7387758,3,B014DEGTEO,"This movie strikes me as a remake of 'The World, the Flesh and the Devil' made in 1959. That movie starred Harry Belafonte, Ingar Stevens and Mel Ferrer so the color of the cast is similar even though I know this movie is based on  the book of the same name written in 2007. The author, Robert O'Brien, must have seen the original movie as the story line is similar, but the original movie was more about race as I remember.

For those who need lots of action or CGI special effects, this movie will disappoint you. For those who want plot and character, you will enjoy this movie.",1472774400,,581,4.321100917431193

7387778,4,B014DEGTEO,"I never read the book but I did enjoy this movie. In the movie, a children's Bible story is featured on a book shelf with the title 'A for Adam'. It sits there among many other Christian books. So I assume the title, 'Z for Zachariah' suggests the last man on earth. And then conjure in your mind the phrase 'not if you were the last man on earth'... picture that guy and imagine a scenario where he is your only hope. You meet this guy and he is a genius & hardworking but certain faults.

Then outta nowhere comes along another Zachariah. Not as smart but sexy & hot. At that point the story turns into a primal male vs male territory, kill or be killed flick.

I liked the story for the strong female character surviving in harsh conditions. The ingenuity of the characters to make those conditions easier. And for the dialogue unspoken. It felt more like reality TV than watching a movie.",1472774400,,892,4.367469879518072

This is a *very* quiet and slow-moving storyline, but it's effective enough that I enjoyed it.

An apocalypse happens.  At first we're led to believe Margot Robbie (who's VERY cute by the way- sorry just had to get that in there!) is all alone with her dog and stranded on her farm.  Then while walking along the hilltops she sees a vehicle in the middle of the road with nobody around.  She gets nervous since she thinks she's the only survivor on the planet.  Normal behavior.  Chiwetel Ejiofor appears, and luckily for Margot he's here to contribute realizing the two need to stick together to survive (well not at first... not when Margot pulls a gun on Chiwetel who's only trying to enjoy a nice swim!)

Chiwetel is a handyman and in my opinion the best actor in the movie.  He can build a windmill powered by electricity (hydroelectricity that is).  He can run generations to make sure everything around the house is running.  He knows how to get gas to squirt from pumps at nearby gas stations without the need for electricity.  He can help with the farming in the fields.  Chiwetel and Margot become more than just good friends and survivors- they start developing feelings for each other.  However halfway through the movie Chris Pine comes along.  He doesn't seem as trustworthy as Chiwetel.  Though he comes off as perfectly normal, you get the feeling something is off and he's hiding something.

Margot seems attracted to Chris more so than Chiwetel, but to be honest the feeling I got while watching this story develop is that she's only casually interested in either.  She second guesses her sexual decisions with both (such as removing her clothing while sitting on bed for Chiwetel, or how she reluctantly approaches the bathroom where Chris is).  It's like Margot wants romance... but she doesn't want romance!  I won't spoil what happens later but uh, well I won't mention it.  Let's just say Chris comes off like a super nice guy but something happens to him.

It's not like the whole movie is based around romance.  There are elements of the three working together in the fields and especially working on that windmill that deviates from the love portion of the story.  I enjoy this movie but I can understand the complaints.  The movie feels like there should have been more to it.  More should have developed between all three characters.  More backstory (though we get just enough I think).  Perhaps more friction between Chiwetel and Chris should have occurred, leading to some actual fighting or suspenseful moments between the two (and the door was certainly open for such moments when the two went hunting together and it appeared Chris had a gun pointed at the back of Chiwetel's head).  I don't know.

And did Chiwetel have diabetes in the beginning and required a shot?  I don't think we got an answer there, but at least Margot knew how to help because without that shot his outcome didn't look good, but why was this never brought up again?  Was it a cure-all magic shot?  I don't think diabetes works that way so perhaps he was going through some kind of illness, and that one shot cured him.

Either way this movie does a few things really well- tells an easy story, has a magnificent presentation and even has a great mood.  Yes the ending's bad- that much is very true.  No it doesn't really *feel* like these are the last three people on earth since they never venture away from the farm so whenever the characters mention that this particular piece of land was saved miraculously, it's hard to swallow because we never see the other parts of the planet destroyed.  Still recommended.",1472515200,,3931,4.65166908563135

A movie for the mind more so than the eye, no explosions or alien beings etc. These three people form a love triangle, 2 guys in love with the same girl as it appears. The movie leaves a lot for the imagination as to what's happened and to what's going on but says a lot about human feelings and us and or them as human beings. I shall not speak of anything pertaining to the plot as not to reveal any spoilers. Acting in the movie, though only having 3 characters, is superb, top notch by all, as is the screen play, directing and cinematography. It's a movie that leaves a lot questions and things to debate, it's a movies you may have to ""get"" and may be one you'll get or not get which may weigh in as to how well you'll like it. It's based on, though totally different than, a book by the same name. Two thumbs up for me.",1471737600,5,1112,4.152777777777778

I guess the performance are good, but really the takeaway is that it's a love triangle which Amazon has coded as ""suspenseful"" and the only sci fi part of it is that it's post apocalyptic and someone has a cool looking hazmat suit on.  Oh and the ""mystery"" that they talk about in the tagline...is probably how they convinced these people to be in this incredibly boring movie.  Or it could be that the mystery is ""which guy will get the girl?"" which is lame.

If you wanted a silver-lining view, it allows you to imagine all sorts of ways the story could have concluded.

One plus is that, for the most part, there is no super-drama - hour-long fistfights, shooting guns that apparently have limitless ammunition, etc. Taking the base story as a given, everything that proceeds from there is reasonable. The actors also were very good.",1471478400,,716,4.682539682539683

Later, she (Margot Robbie character) got ""dolled up,"" cooked a nice dinner, and got silly/stupid on wine. At this point, I was done.

Ann is a strong young woman of about 18. Surviving  on her own for a year hoping to see her family again.
John was a great character. He could have taken advantage of young Ann but he did not despite her advances.
Along comes Caleb. He's quite handsome and closer to Ann's age. Of course there's sparks, opposite the gentle, tender love she has for John.
They all 3 work together through the summer to build a water wheel. One night after a few drinks, John falls asleep and Ann seeks out Calebs attention. This is where I think the ""Z for Zachariah"" comes in. We are left wondering what exactly happened to Caleb. SPOILERS----  I thinks she's pregnant and John killed Caleb by letting him fall into the water... John seems remorseful as he stands over the edge of waterfall. Ann looks sad and depressed as she sits by snowy open window.  I wish they had played it out, but my ending seems quite plausible. What do you think?",1471132800,,1130,4.423076923076923

I did watch the entire movie. And I did like it well enough...however...why is it called ""Z for Zachariah""? Don't know. Maybe a Bible reference I don't get? Maybe the girl's brother was named Zachariah and I missed that.

At times, it feels as if it could be a play. There are very few elaborate settings, with a lot of the most important moments taking place at a dinner table or in front of an old chapel. Dialogue isn't necessary in many of these small moments. Things can be interpreted through body language and the expression on a characters face. Its a certain type of filmmaking that you don't see very often anymore, and I applaud Craig Zobel for his restraint and finesse. This is certainly one of the more thought-provoking movies Ive seen all year, and is definitely worth your time.
The cast of three did a great job to me keeping the story line touching as each share their experiences and continue to survive the fall out.  The love triangle or not I loved the thought that they were willing to take a chance at love again.

Margot Robbie was excellent.  I didn't think she had acting chops until I saw this.  She should do more films like this instead of what she usually signs up for (ugh, Suicide Squad).

I do admit to having a fit watching Tom Cruise in an awful wig prance about trying to mimic the vampire Lestat. It still turns my stomach. But a review is about the movie and I really enjoyed this one.  It was a nice paring of people working toward a common goal with a mutual respect of each's contributions. The virginal woman was protected by the man who was protective of her welfare and  recognized her trusting nature, never taking advantage and providing the mechanics and know-how she had no exposure to.  It worked well and a mutual trust and respect of their differing knowledge base worked well. He did not take advantage of her confusion about what her place was as a part of a new Adam & Eve. Enter the snake, Chris Pine. Stealing and manipulative from day one. Something she was not familiar with. He took advantage, as was his nature, as she strove to be proper with kindness by inviting him into the house. It was only a matter of time before the snake treated her as a pit stop at the bathroom sink, rather than the object of gentle love and respect that every person deserves. The snake disappears with little explanation as it deserves none and the virgin asks  for none as it is just accepted and they move on toward rebuilding their lives, humanity, as if the snake had never existed.

A better, more precise system is needed so you don't waste time watching  some  crap that has a 3 or 4 star rating. How many 5 star rated movies do you ever see? And, why even offer films that are 1 star? The acting was good, the characters were uncommon in there relationships to each other. The post-apocalyptic scenario not new was not developed. It was worth watching. It left some unanswered questions. I don't think it's worth a sequel to find out the answers.",1470787200,,634,4.188524590163935

7388499,3,B014DEGTEO,"I do not expect a movie to religiously follow the novel it is based on. Adding a third character was okay, but the ending of the movie really did not make sense. I say this not because I am against leaving some issues to the imagination of the viewer/reader, but because this movie required a schizophrenic break to be able to go along with it whichever course it took no matter how much thought one puts into it. The ending of the novel made perfect sense. This was a slow-paced, post-apocalypse movie that focused on character development rather than action scenes. There are audiences for both so that does not detract from the movie. Overall I am glad I watched it, but mainly to satisfy my curiosity regarding how the screen play was adapted from the book. A reasonable ending would have greatly enhanced my satisfaction. The nihilists won this round.",1470700800,2,856,4.675496688741722

I was disappointed because the movie had all the basic components to be great including very good actors / acting, the setting and a simple storyline, but it was disjointed and presumptuous providing too much information in some scenes and not enough in others.  The exclamations were surprises though not in an exciting way.  These left question marks that were poetically incomplete and therefore created holes in the story line that no actor could overcome.

The acting was good enough, the plot a bit contrived, and not enough latent hostility. Had they stuck more to the original it might have been more popular with the thriller crowd.

Perhaps as a means of creating greater mystery in the film. I find the ending both intriguing and infuriating. I like that it was an apocalyptic tell full of mystery. There was no definitive cause for the desolation of the population, there isn't even a clear good and evil. I like films that make you work as the audience. However, this film made me work and didn't provide equal payoff. Though not every question needed to be answered, I wish some of the burning mysteries of the plot line had answers that were alluded to in a more concrete way. I know that sounds like an oxymoron, but it would have been nice to have at least an 80% certainty of what happened or at least some kind of moral undertone or message. Instead, you come in with questions and leave with more questions. With that said, I thought the acting and suspense and silent moments were wonderful. I will say, had I not read other reviews I would have never know that this was supposed to be America and I don't think the director should have tried to set the film in America. The scenery clearly wasn't American and the actors weren't either. They were so refined in their mannerism that they should have just stayed true to their European roots.

If you prefer (as I do) movies that portray religion in it's ""proper"" context (such as, The Apostle, The Book of Eli, Frailty, 10 Cloverfield Lane etc)... then this film is sure to disappoint.

much better suited for a different movie. The actor Chiwetel Ejiofor

John is played by Chiwetel Ejiofor. I usually see him playing supporting roles in many movies which didn't stand out much. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays a contract engineer who worked for the Army. He was able to survive when the contamination happened. Throughout the movie, I didn't buy his acting as an engineer or him as one of the main casts. He lacked emotions on his face or maybe that's his character calls for? who knows...In most scenes, Chiwetel Ejiofor just had his eyes wide open like he didn't know what to expect. With the film has only 3 main characters, you can't help but to judge the each performance more critical. Chris Pine's performance was adequate. He didn't strike me as someone who worked in the mines. Maybe he needs a little more make-under. Margot, however, put up an above average performance.

7388703,3,B014DEGTEO,"Loved the acting.  Was not so impressed with the story line.  First off, Margot Robbie and Chiwetel Ejiofor are wonderful in their roles, nut the role of Caleb, played by Chris Pine, is not fleshed out enough and I was never sure whether he was a sociopath or not.  Then, reading others' reviews I realized in the original book, John (Chiwetel Ejiofor), was supposed to be a sociopath!  Which never occurred to me while watching the movie.  John's actions at the end are not entirely in synch with his character at the beginning (and middle) but I felt, probably because Mr. Ejiofor created such a sympathetic character, I could understand, in context, his actions.  Margot Robbie's character is the most consistent and very well fleshed out, and she played her character perfectly.  The story is apocalyptic, with some hope, but John's actions are even less understandable towards the end of the movie because he is clearly an educated, intelligent, and thinking person.  He, of the three of them, would have figured right away out they needed all 3 to survive and repopulate the planet.  I just thought the story itself had flaws that made no sense given the 2 main characters who were presented in the movie.

7388711,3,B014DEGTEO,"Nissar Modi wrote the screenplay, altering much of the original novel by Robert C. OBrien, and gave it to young Craig Zobel to direct his small 3 person cast in Iceland, Switzerland, New Zealand, and the USA. The result is a tiny Indie film that despite a cast of three fine actors the movie never quite gets off the ground.

First the synopsis: In the wake of a nuclear war, a young woman Ann Burden (Margot Robbie) survives on her own, fearing she may actually be the proverbial last woman on earth, until she discovers the most astonishing sight of her life: another human being John Loomis (Chiwetel Ejiofor). A distraught scientist, he's nearly been driven mad by radiation exposure and his desperate search for others. A fragile, imperative strand of trust connects them. But when a stranger Caleb (Chris Pine) enters the valley, their precarious bond begins to unravel into an emotionally charged love triangle as the last known survivors.

We wonder how landscape so beautiful and fertile in the scenes where the trio relates could be so perfect if indeed there has been a nuclear war that destroyed everyone on the planet. But gradually interrelationships occur, a plan is made by Loomis to build a waterwheel to create electricity and Caleb aids his efforts. Loomis remains an enigma throughout, Caleb brings a little sense to the story, and Ann just adjusts day by day. Though we know how the triad likely ends we are not allowed the reasoning. The movie just sort of stops.

One aspect that makes the movie one of note is looking at the very possible concept of the end of the world in a less climactic way than the superheroes would play it. There are some lessons here  some subtle, most not. Grady Harp, July 16",1469318400,,1726,4.7052980132450335

7388730,2,B014DEGTEO,"I love Margot Robbie she is stunningly beautiful. That is all there is to like about this movie. The movie has a sole purpose to make the viewer uncomfortable and it succeeds but not to the full extent it probably wanted to. I had guessed this movie to go in the direction of getting subliminally preachy about race relations and which race treats the other race better, but it doesn't even finish it's thought on the awkward race issue. At least it could have had the conclusion of basic psychology that we are drawn to those most like us naturally basic instinct. It does not develop to this resolve either. What we have with Z for Zachariah is a want to be thought provoking but non achieving, want to hint at deep metaphors but not achieving, want to be artsy and full of itself without any real reason to be taken serious and artsy and successfully achieving in full on that regard bland film. The location and scenery is a high point of this movie, beautiful backdrops of stunning nature but no animal wildlife encounters for these characters to be surrounded by such vast wilderness. Major misstep on lack of wildlife present to make this backdrop more lush and believable. As one reviewer here wrote: You only get to see the main character 'Robbie's dog for half the film onscreen with no explanation as to where the dog is in the whole second half of the film, as if every viewer watching would not notice and question this flub being the first two characters we see are Margot Robbie and her dog struggling by their lonesome for a good amount of time leading off the films opening. I purchased this movie very cheap used on amazon and feel if you were to take that approach you may get your money's worth being that Margot Robbie is easy on the eyes and can keep your attention if she was sitting playing chess or something in a whole movie. Unless you feel very bored and like wasting time or you are as big a fan of M. Robbie as i, i would recommend avoiding a film that leaves you dissatisfied and never goes deep enough into character development or profound metaphors as it leads you to believe. The ending of the film is not as surprising as it should be either, in no way makes the viewer satisfied for the agony paced, slow, drag along, plot n dialog here. 2 stars an that might be a bit generous.",1457913600,4,2315,4.436619718309859

7388744,2,B014DEGTEO,"Z for Zachariah is a nice nostalgic throwback to what end of the world literature used to revolve around before zombies dominated fiction, especially YP fiction and their movie spin offs. That thing, nuclear war, and survival in a world under the mushroom clouds in a world where the soil and water is full of radiation.  In this case, a young woman lives alone on a farm in a valley that has somehow escaped the fallout, and is like the prior world.  Her family left looking for survivors to help and never came back.  One day she sees a man wearing a hazmat suit pulling a caravan.

As this movie started it seemed awfully familiar, I was wondering if it was the same story as some book that was compulsory as part of an English class in one of the lower grades of high school. I didn't remember the name of the book but I'm pretty sure it was the same basic plot, as I remember we had to write the next diary entry by Anne after the pages of the book concluded.  Which is why I wonder why we had such a weak ending in this book which isn't really an ending at all instead it is be described as a sort of a fizzling out.  I'm pretty sure one of these characters wasn't even in the book, but I can't remember, but the plots parts revolving around three's a crowd rather than what happened in the book certainly weren't better ones.

Even if you've never read the book this is based on, you'll probably find the second half a bit of a snooze fest. You'll be disappointed with the fizz out ending too.  If it has followed the way the novel ended, it would have been so much better.  If they didn't want to do that, well anything would have been better than this. Plus what happened to the dog, it was on screen until about half way through, then we never saw it again, did the canine actor have a better job offer during filming and just never turned up for the second half? By the way the book was called the same name as the movie and was written by Robert C. O'Brien if you wanted to check it out.

7388764,3,B014DEGTEO,"This movie is just okay as a film but has a great underlying story that gets you thinking. What would you be willing to do for love or at least the potential/promise of love? Can a man change his character or will terrible circumstances just bring out his true personality that is too powerful to overcome? How does the introduction of a third person impact a couple's relationship - especially when they might be the only people left alive on the planet?

All of these questions are raised in the movie. Unfortunately, none of them are fully developed. Instead, we are left with halted dialogue and long glances that don't deepen our understanding of or emotional ties to the characters. Chris Pine does a decent job, though not as good as Chiwetel Ejiofor, but Margot Robbie isn't a strong enough actor to pull off being in the starring role. Also, the movie would have been better if we had seen flashbacks of each of the character's life or true personality before the catastrophe. As it is, we learn almost nothing about the characters, so the two major events in the movie that should have a big impact really don't because we just don't care that much about the people in the film.

I would have given this movie two stars if it were not for Chiwetel Ejiofor. He does his best to make something meaningful out of his role. If he had stronger co-stars, maybe he would have succeeded. As it is, the movie mostly fell flat.",1451692800,,1427,4.54863813229572
7388765,1,B014DEGTEO,"This movie has so much potential and should get 4 stars just for that, but it's trashed horribly.  I hate the way the actress in this movie, Margot Robbie, slips into being over-sexed without any thought as to character. She should be the main character, but just by having some depth Ejiofor the black Adam, takes over that role.

Margot's character was not consistent:  If she were truly longing for deep, or even trivial, connection with the opposite sex she would act differently when she observes Loomer  from the woods as he struggles with his suit.  There is no sensitivity or meaning given to the fact that he's a man and she's a woman.  No fear for example.  Fear would speak of the potential power of an encounter that could change everything for her.  Certainly if instead of Z for Zacharia, as in this movie you're doing more of an A for Adam and E for Eve then be consistent in your theme and the idea you are exploring.

Loomer's being black is also ignored, hence without the power it deserves.  It's just there: significant obviously in this case, as a new world begins, but not allowed to be acknowledged.  An artist is not in control when he finds himself ignoring reality -- reality is what fantasy is about.  Present cultural attitudes, however good and liberal, are the tail wagging the dog in this case.

Why make a fascinating situation ordinary and boring?  A couple struggling to know each other suddenly are confronted by another man (or woman) who threatens in a easy-hearted way the serious business of the primary relationship.  This happens everyday and to practically everyone often during life.  It's inevitable...so show us some ""character.""

The actors do not develop ""characters."" They just act like old shoes, or rather act like actors, as in ""I am a gorgeous actress/actor; whatever I do is sexual and powerful and great.""  So predictable.  I want to forget I'm seeing actors.  I want to be possessed by the characters, but first the actors must allow for this, get out of the way.

Ejiofor does this best, though not consistently.  For example, he seemed truly to like Caleb; hence motivation and feeling are not developed for what Loomer does at the end. You can't have both feelings developed in a relationship, unless you make a long movie.

A shocking ending (which I won't reveal) is not enough to save this lazy fearful effort?  Making a movie takes a lot of work, time, and money. The scenery alone would make this movie.  But thinking through a movie's primary content-- the story and its characters does not take much-- Do that while you sleep!  Creative people are everywhere.  Why not a little more mature treatment for a movie with such interesting premises and a world of possibilities?  Call it C for Courage.

I still find ""Z for Zacharia"" worth watching. I haven't read the book yet, but could see which elements were added just to follow a tried and true (trashy) movie formula. Unfortunately movies and books both suffer from the fact that any writer will allow for anything to get a movie associated however inadequately with her work.",1451606400,,3092,4.737827715355805
7388766,5,B014DEGTEO,"Yes, this is another ""end of human civilization"" movie -- but it's definitely not ""just another"" genre film. There's not a single zombie, or shape-shifting alien, or giant comet, or shiny spaceship, or splatter of blood to be found. Instead, it's an exceedingly quiet, deliberately-paced human study about the nature of loneliness, the fragility of trust, the notion of faith, and the way simple human jealousy and emotion and unravel the most triumphant steps toward progress. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking. But the story's powerhouse center is comprised of brilliant, brilliant performances all around -- plus an ending that's haunting and heartbreaking on multiple levels. If you're looking for pulse-pounding, fast-paced action, this movie will NOT be your cup of tea ... and that's NOT the kind of movie it's trying to be. Watching these superb actors express three or four conflicting emotions all at once -- with a simple nod, or touch, or awkward glance away -- was mesmerizing enough for me.

Ann is made into an overly religious fool who's willing and does hop into bed with whoever will take her. She doesn't kill her dog, she doesn't leave.  Her and Mr. Loomis live happily ever after.

The whole thing is an uninspired exercise in ho-hum post-apocolyptic fiction with cheap production values and a bunch of WTF elements that apparently reflect lazy writing/direction.  I hate to blame the actors in this case, they're mostly doing as they are told. Non-spolier example:  a huge deal is made of the presence of a radioactive pool of water so deadly that a minute's exposure nearly kills the Ejiofor character. Until saved by a magic elixir that subsequently disappears from the story.  Later, when required by the plot two characters spend hours in the radioactive spray feeding the pond but suffer no ill effects - until required again for the plot.

""Ann thought she was the only one left alive. She was wrong."" tagline from Robert C. O'Brien's book ""Z for Zachariah"".

Four ENGAGING Stars. ""Z for Zachariah"" is a deliberately-paced, post-apocalyptic drama based on the eponymously-titled book by award-winning author Robert C. O'Brien. This is a psychodrama with no Sci-Fi action or CGI effects. Beautifully shot, the movie begins with a person in a strange outfit foraging in a completely empty, dilapidated town. When she finally strips away the plastic suit, away from the town and high in the hills, it is the character Ann who is apparently the last survivor of the nuclear war, living a very austere life, played wonderfully by Australian actress Margot Robbie (""The Wolf of Wall Street"", ""Focus"") using a soft Southern accent. In the book, she is 18 and believes she is the last surviving human. Later, her dog finds a delirious man in a metallic suit, Loomis, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor (""12 Years A Slave"", ""The Martian""), another survivor who, surveying the area radiation levels, discovers this is a high-country paradise isolated from deadly nuclear radiation. They form a tenuous relationship, and when Chris Pine (Captain Kirk of the ""Star Trek"" movies and ""Jack Ryan, Shadow Recruit"") arrives, playing Caleb, the storyline is set: the last woman and the last two men on Earth, different philosophies, different pasts, different attractions, different needs, a common cause, all rushing towards an unexpected climax. The actors are brilliantly cast and the acting is fantastic.

Robert C. O'Brien did not finish the last part of the book before he passed: the book was completed by family based on his notes-it's possible we might have gotten both a different book and movie ending, had he finished it. Produced by Tobey MaGuire and others. Screen play by Nissar Modi. Directed by Craig Zobel. Great music by Heather McIntosh. It got better with a second look. Very Definitely Recommended. Raised by a half-star after re-watching to Four ABSORBING Stars! (Amazon Prime Video, Lionsgate and Roadside Attractions. Color. CC. X-Ray. Time-1:37:55.

7388775,3,B014DEGTEO,"Well I have a used copy on order for a couple bucks and I guess I will be somewhat disappointed.  The film was in theaters for such a short time, I never had a chance to see it.  I did read the book which I thought was pretty good, but it looks like a lot of the plot has been changed around as producers and screenwriters and directors do.  This was supposed to be something along the lines of a possible few last persons on Earth type situation, but was written into a Love Triangle of sorts?  That's a shame when you have 2 well established actors in Chiwe Ejoifor (usually in very good productions) and Chris Pine (Star Trek films aside he's been in a couple of hit &  miss productions-but usually pretty good) and the third actor in Margot Robbie who is getting better and better all of the time.  They actually let Miss Robbie change her appearance slightly in this film so that she is not just playing a beautiful blonde.  When I saw the trailer I thought I would really like this film but when I do get to see it in a few days I think I may enjoy but it won't be what the original story was which will be a shame.

7388782,3,B014DEGTEO,"Not the best, not the worst.  The film is another one of those end of the world types where there are few survivors if any and not a lot to look forward to in life. A young woman named Ann is all alone in an extremely small town, her family abandoned her to look for survivors elsewhere and she has managed to farm and hunt to survive with no help at all.  Another man named John shows up he too all alone and desperate and slowly he and Ann bond over their misfortunes and hopes of taking what Ann has and with his knowledge improving life for both of them that is until Caleb shows up.
Somewhat mysterious with a different type of personality that Ann and John has Caleb is also a survivor of the worlds fallout needing help and takes advantage of the hospitality that Ann provides.  There is a mistrust that John has for Caleb instantly and he can see there is a bond developing between the two and that is where the movie gets interesting....

I liked this movie for the characters down on their luck have done the best they can do to survive in the situation they are in. All 3 actors have taken this small movie and made it into something and there is a surprise twist that you cannot see coming literally...and as good as it is it also ends the movie on a sour note.  I would have liked to have seen the outcome of John's decision and what had become of Ann even though in my opinion I got the feeling she was very sad and John himself seemed the worse for wear.

7388787,1,B014DEGTEO,"I was excited to see they had made a movie of one of my favorite novels. I approached it almost with reverence, albeit with some trepidation that they might veer from the original subject matter. When I saw the promo picture, I knew something was amiss, for there were only two characters in the novel. I had hopes the damage was not too severe, but the moving and elegantly written novel was completely eviscerated, and there was little to enjoy, aside from the scenery, in this sad knockoff. That is not to say that the actors were not good in their roles, they acted their parts as given to them, but the screenplay had none of the grit, drama, or faith of the original. Anne's faith in God and her relationship with Him was trivialized and mocked, rather than being central to her strength and survival. John was not nearly as developed as he was in the novel, and became almost charming. His intent on furthering the human race at any cost was actually reversed, and Anne was subjected to none of the grief and adventure which were to result in the final catharsis of the novel. Not that that matters, that choice was never even made in the movie. All tragedies were averted, and nothing can be learned from the resultant saccharine and weak version we have been given. Heck, even her dog survived. Changing John's race and Anne's age were poor decisions that confused the relationship and interaction between these two characters, and adding Caleb distracted from and marred the beauty and intent of the original storyline. The adaptation was painful to watch, and I am looking forward to reading the novel again so that I might forget this inept fumbling of what had been great literature. It is a real travesty, as the original story was something to move the soul. Two thumbs down, and 0 stars if I could rate it so.",1448150400,,1825,4.601226993865031

They instead rewrite the 1959 movie to allow Harry Bellefonte's character to make good on his threat to kill Mel Ferrer's character.

7388835,4,B014DEGTEO,"Potential spoilers.  It seems like there are 5 or 6 movies that surface each year dealing with life after an apocalyptic event.  Most are action/thrillers with good guys fighting off the bad guys or aliens.  Every once in a while, a quieter more serene film is released.  2012s ""Die Wand (The Wall)"" comes to mind.  This film is actually based on a 1975 young adult novel by Robert C. OBrien.  The storys heroine, Ann Burden believes she is the only survivor after what we are led to believe is the aftermath of World War III, or at least a nuclear holocaust.  In OBriens novel, Ann is 16 but here she appears to be about 19 and is played perfectly by a tomboyish Margot Robbie.  If your reference point for Ms. Robbie is her stunning turn in The Wolf of Wall Street or Focus you're in for a pleasant surprise.  Those early films were no fluke.  This girl can act.

Anns been on her own for a while living in a valley set in the high rolling hills of somewhere in the U. S.  She has no electricity, but grew up on a farm so has been self-sufficient.  Her only friend is her dog.  While out hunting, she comes upon a strange looking cart left in the middle of the road.  Exploring further she comes across a black man, bathing in a natural pond.  Fearful at first, her need for human contact provokes her to approach, screaming that the water is contaminated by radiation.  John Loomis (Chiwetel Ejiofor), an engineer who survived because he was deep underground during the event has been wearing a protective suit and has been seeking higher ground.  He becomes seriously ill but is cared for with medication he had in his cart and Anns nursing skills.

John learns quickly that Ann is a religious young woman, always referencing Him (God) and His plan.  Her father was a minister and she has numerous religiously themed books in her library.  One is a childrens book that John opens to the first chapter, A is for Adam which I suspect is where the film and books title comes from.  There is the occasional chafing between Anns faith and Johns science, but they both respect each others beliefs.

Stepping away from the novel, director Craig Zobel and screenwriter Nissar Modi introduce a new character halfway through the film.  Caleb  OK, sure  is played by hunky Chris Pine and brings an obvious third party conflict into the mix.  Earlier, given the opportunity by a wine-fortified Ann, John turned down Anns romantic advances.  Ann is clearly not experienced and portrays a certain naivety throughout the movie.  As John suggests to Ann, things change after sex.  Caleb and Ann have a spark as well.  But where will it go?  Re-populating the species is subtly suggested more than once.

For a while, the trio live in apparent harmony.  John and Caleb manage to build a power source (water wheel) to fuel a generator for electricity, but how long will this all last?  Those looking for action, thrills and chills need to look elsewhere.  The film languidly moves along and is based upon the interaction between the 3 characters.  The film is also open to metaphorical interpretation.  And if you need a tidy conclusion, this isn't your film.  I loved it.",1445817600,2,3158,4.611510791366906

It's just that there was no vision for us to care about these so-called survivors. And it was hardly entertaining. That's all I can say.  If you do decide to watch the film, keep an eye on the dog.

I think they used the diversity card to make the movie more palatable.  The screen writers wanted two men playing against each other - not in the book.  The movie screen writers went way beyond artistic license.  They wrote their own story willy-nilly.  This time it did not work at all.  The book version of Mr. Loomis is a controlling psychopathic ingrate.  He was not depicted this way in the movie.  Where was Mr. Loomis?  The movie did not even explain why the title of the story was ""Z for Zachariah."" I feel sorry for the author, Robert Leslie Conly, (deceased) and his family as this is not his story. I suggest the book currently available on Audible.com and at Amazon.  Skip the movie because it really sucked. If you never read the book maybe the movie could get a 3.",1443484800,44,1089,4.375
7388878,5,B014DEGTEO,"NOTE: Yes, those were my quotes all over the trailers and posters. Thanks to those who noticed and messaged me about it.

In 2012, Craig Zobel's impressive but difficult to endure directorial debut Compliance looked with dim-colored glasses at the ways power can be used to control others. His follow-up, the sci-fi flavored Z for Zachariah also looks at authority, albeit a much higher one, and how one's faith can be manipulated by others to achieve their ends, but also how we use it to lie to ourselves about our own desires.

Only three characters occupy space in this intimate but gripping thriller set in the wake of a disaster that has destroyed the human population and rendered much of the planet uninhabitable.  Margot Robbie trades in the glamorous characters we're accustomed to seeing her in for the role of Ann, the lone survivor in a pocket of unaffected land. More than capable of surviving on her own, although her trusty dog is by her side, Ann hunts and farms to eke out a meager, lonely existence.  That changes when she encounters Loomis (Chiwetel Ejiofor), the first human she's seen in ages and a lifeline out of her despair. It's clear he's been in much the same boat, and after an accident leaves him sick with radiation poisoning the two set aside their mutual mistrust to take care of one another.

Anytime two lonely people are placed in such close proximity the spark of romance is probable, but it's inevitable given the extreme nature of their circumstances.  And while Zobel slowly builds to that passion through their work to build a sustainable life, he's more interested in the ideological differences that could derail everything.  She's driven by the power of her religious convictions, believing to the core of her being that God has done all of this for a reason. Loomis, while not an outright atheist, is a scientist who has no qualms about tearing down her father's old church to build a power source to survive a harsh winter. While there are no pointed, heated debates, the film is too elegantly constructed for that, its never far out of mind as new temptations creep into their lives. The arrival of a shady but charming drifter named Caleb (Chris Pine) awakens the passion in Ann, while also providing her an outlet to express her faith. Naturally it doesn't please Loomis to nearly the same degree, and soon the pressure builds between both men as they subtly one-up each other to win Ann's love.

Rich with themes of jealousy, contempt, and lust, Z for Zachariah explores the internal conflict between the needs of the flesh and of the soul. It's a powerful follow-up for Zobel, and he's proving to be a director capable of pulling the best from his actors. It's refreshing to see Robbie in a complicated, vanity-free role like this as she was already getting pigeonholed as a screen vixen. As Ann she gets to show vulnerability we've yet to see from her before, and at this point one has to recognize how integral she's been to the success of every film she's been in. Ejiofor is simply amazing once again, and perhaps has the most complicated, wide-ranging role to play. Once again Ejiofor is placed in the role of a man forced to endure hardships, both great and small, for a chance to live the life he imagined. Pine's role is less defined than the others but its good to see him outside of a larger ensemble for once.

While predicting which films will go on to greater things outside of the festival is always tricky, Z for Zachariah is a masterfully done film of deep complexity that everyone would be wise to seek out.",1443484800,2,3575,4.688995215311005

Ejiofor is smoothly competent and Pine shows his ambivalent charisma to advantage, but this is Robbie's show.  While not a terribly challenging role, her portrayal of an American ""country girl"" is pitch-perfect--committed without being overbearing (similar to Jennifer Lawrence's effort in ""Winter's Bone"").  She handles the gothic triangle with grace and nuance, demonstrating a level of skill that should be taken seriously.

Well-directed and beautifully shot, the only weakness of the film is the absence of a thematic spine.  The movie isn't really *about* anything, which attenuates any sort of emotional impact, and renders the ending unsatisfying.  This is a shame, because there are plenty of promising threads, but no real catharsis--the plot merely ends.

7388924,5,B014DEGTEO,"Despite its post-apocalyptic backdrop, Z for Zachariah is not a movie about the end of the world. Though the state of the human race is certainly a component, the film is more about the complexity of relationships (especially under unusual circumstances). In scope, this is not a huge movie. Its fairly contained, in fact, but the viewer slowly falls into this world thats been effortlessly created by director Craig Zobel.

The film opens with our main character Ann (Margot Robbie), a resourceful woman whos managed to stay alive and keep her farm productive in the face of a mysterious disaster thats left the planet desolate. Shes surviving and keeping a life for herself when she comes across another human being: a scientist ravaged mentally from radiation exposure (Chiwetel Ejiofor). She takes him in, managing to nurse him back to health, and they form a distinct bond. However, this connection quickly unravels when a stranger enters the picture (played by Chris Pine). A love triangle emerges amidst the complications of survival and starting over, and the performances between the three are truly accomplished.

The dynamic between these characters is something that has definitely been done before, but theres something refreshing about the simplicity of the film. At times, it feels as if it could be a play. There are very few elaborate settings, with a lot of the most important moments taking place at a dinner table or in front of an old chapel. Dialogue isn't necessary in many of these small moments. Things can be interpreted through body language and the expression on a characters face. Its a certain type of filmmaking that you don't see very often anymore, and I applaud Craig Zobel for his restraint and finesse.

7388940,5,B014DEGTEO,"I really don't know what to think about this film...there are at least two or three underlying messages in this film.  The title itself does not make much sense. No wonder a lot folks here are grading this film so low, because it is too strenuous for them to even consider the basic meaning behind this film.  The film takes place in some unspecified little town somewhere in USA (however the film was shot in Switzerland and New Zeeland) and it can be classified as one of those apocalyptic films, yet it is mostly about human relations in the times when humanity went extinct.  The film features only three actors for its entirety.  One young, Caucasian beautiful female (who happens to be the main character of the film) and one African-American middle-age male who is introduced somewhat at the begging of the film.  Twenty or thirty minutes into the film, another male character is thrown in, this time a young Caucasian male.  So now we have, a young, lonely, hard-working, very independent, longing for human contact (a.k.a sex) Caucasian girl under the roof of her house with an African-American (or so I think) older gentleman of unknown background (somewhat shady) who falls in love with the girl, and a young Caucasian guy who happens to be about the same age as the girl and from near by...all under the same roof, all trying to survive, all trying to go back to normalcy, all trying to make home for themselves, all trying to love again...one woman, two guys, something bad is bound to happen...EXCEPTIONAL THRILLER with racial issues and apocalyptic catastrophe as the background story.

I really don't know what the director of this film is trying to say through this film...and I don't want to spoil the movie for you guys out there who still haven't seen it.  All I can say is that as a Caucasian young male I have mixed feeling about this film...which does not necessary mean that I did not like the film, quite the opposite, I really like movies that make me wonder...and this film will definitely be on my mind for a very long while...

The atmosphere in the film and the filming location(s) are alone worth 5 stars...

""SPOILERS ALERT"" please do not read if you have not seen the film.
1. What does Zacharian stand for in this film?
2. Was Mr. Loomis the so called ""Zacharian"" (meaning the Biblical Zacharian).
3. Did Mr. Loomis kill Caleb at the end? (I like to think so...its not shown, but it can be inferred very easily).
4. Did Mr. Loomis ""physically love"" Ann? or was it more of a fatherly love?
5. What is the meaning behind a black man killing a white man who slept with a white woman, if the white woman came to the white man first?
6. Is the director trying to say that a black man can give a white woman better ""love""?
7. What does this film tell us about our current society?
8. What is the meaning behind Mr. Loomis killing Ann's brother, and later revealing it to her, and the connection between that killing and the murdering of Caleb? Both were white guys, and both were somewhat dear to Ann's heart, and both were killed by a black guy...
9. What is the meaning behind Ann's nourishment of Mr. Loomis when he was near death?
10. Why did Mr. Loomis told Ann that he loved her after the lake swim? Was he afraid that she will put out to a white guy...instead of him?",1441670400,,3302,4.506688963210703

7388952,2,B014DEGTEO,"It's not that Z For Zachariah is bad for any particular stand-out reason - it's more than it's an amalgamation of things that don't work together. As such, it comes across as some sort of Lifetime drama you might watch in a hospital where pain-relieving drugs might fix the problems of the third act. It's a gentle snooze, pregnant with promise to explode into violence, but instead is satisfied with turning a church into a hydro-electric generator somewhere towards the end.

It needed some external force to nudge the main characters into action - either the threat of zombies (The Walking Dead), the end of the world's food supply (Interstellar) or the ticking timebomb of death (and watching Arnie trying to act) in Maggie. Instead, the cast is happy to eat, drink, farm, walking around slowly in radiation suits, and chat. And for readers of the original book who didn't see the trailer, Chris Pine's late arrival creates what is adventurously described as a ""love triangle"" which lets the movie coast into a finale that doesn't really resolve anything.

Ultimately the movie conversion removes the themes of the book and replaces them with Chris Pine and a waterwheel. It's so spectacularly uncinematic that you have to wonder how it got through the production process. In all fairness, the acting is fine and Margot Robbie is good, but there is less tension in the whole movie than in the opening credits of The Walking Dead. It's a little like ordering a pizza and the car shows up with a pack of cereal - it's probably better for you but you can't escape the disappointment.",1441497600,156,1584,4.798534798534798

7388971,5,B014DEGTEO,"This movie is averaging 3 stars as of 9/2/15. That's the same 3 star rating as Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 currently holds and there's no comparison in quality. It's no wonder entertainment companies crank out so many marginal, cheesy movies to satisfy the popular ""fast-food"" appetite for entertainment.  This movie was a refreshing change from the typical stream of disappointing films I occasionally get sucked into wasting time and money on.  Yes, I passed on Mall Cop 2 (but I did rent Taken 3. Wow, what was I thinking).

If you were to eliminate the many reviews comparing this movie to the book, the rating would easily rise to 4 stars.  This is a solid 4 to 4.5 star movie but I rounded up to 5 in it's defense as a great film worth watching. I don't know why people read a book, really like it, and then expect the movie to be anything like what they read.  They are two very different mediums and it's impossible to replicate them from the page to the screen.  If you read a great book and subsequently someone bases a movie on it, you should probably skip it or plan on being disappointed because you already ""saw"" the book version inside your head.

This movie makes you think.  This movie makes you imagine.  This movie makes you appreciate every moment of life and the simple luxuries we all take for granted every day; electricity, clean water, healthy fresh food, not living in constant fear, and having other people around to talk to and share it all with.  Many of the bad reviews say the ending leaves too much to the imagination.  These are the same people still upset by Tom Hanks standing in that dirt road intersection at the end of Castaway fifteen years ago with a happy smirk on his face just before the screen went black. There's nothing wrong with leaving something to the imagination or having to think a bit; not everything needs to be shown (that's called a documentary) and quite often that makes a film more interesting and artistic.  It also gives you something to discuss after the movie ends.

In wrapping up; for those of you looking for a thought provoking movie that's well done, this is one of them.  By the way, there were only 3 actors (all gave outstanding performances) in the entire 1 hr and 38 minutes and nobody mentions this in their review because they managed to pull off filling the screen. That's amazing.  Seriously, Castaway had more actors.  OK, one of them was a volleyball for a good part of the movie, but seriously, the Z for Zachariah cast deserves to be recognized for this.

I don't usually write reviews but felt someone needed to speak up and point out this movie is clearly underrated on Amazon.  Thank you for taking a few minutes to read my review and don't let the one and two star reviews turn you away from enjoying this film.",1441152000,4,2791,4.514910536779324

7388977,5,B014DEGTEO,"Not your typical post apocalyptic movie. This story instead provides an excellent examination of human nature held under the magnifying glass of a vaguely described nuclear event. On the surface the tone of the movie is very subdued but the undercurrents of tension between the three characters is what makes this movie truly facinating. Much is left to the audience to figure out since no one character is 100% bad or 100% good and their motivations aren't clearly defined which I found made for great points of discussion. No one will interpret this movie the same way. The open ending leaves you wanting more. It encourages you think, to theorize what exactly went down between the two male leads. All three actors, Margot Robbie, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Chris Pine, masterfully portrayed their characters. If you enjoy a thought provoking story that will stay with you days after you watch it, then I highly recommend you watch Z for Zachariah!",1441152000,2,945,4.949685534591195
7388978,4,B014DEGTEO,"Z for Zachariah is a character drama. The end of the world is the setting needed for the story of the movie to take place.

7388999,3,B014DEGTEO,"Ann Burden (Margot Robbie) and her dog have managed to survive the nuclear holocaust due to the topography of her land and using common sense in dealing with contamination. She meets up with John Loomis (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who has a Geiger counter and a type A protective suit on steroids. He suggests making a generator using hydro-electric power from the water falls. However, in order to do this he would have to take apart the church her father/preacher built. If you happen to look at the DVD cover or movie poster then you know Chris Pine also shows up and the description says ""emotionally charged love triangle"" which is a not exactly a plot spoiler, but he does come late into the film. If there was some way to watch the film having never seen the poster, or knowing he shows up, that would be the way to do it. As for me, I kept waiting for him to show up which made the film go slow with anticipation. So if you are planning a showing, hide the DVD cover.

The title comes from a kids book Ann has on the Bible. John opens the book and sees ""A is for Adam."" One would conclude what ""Z"" would be, as there is a hint and some talk that coating the world with radioactive contamination was part of the plan or at least Ann's survival. The book of Zachariah, talks about the rebuilding of Solomon's Temple as a juxtaposition to the discussing to tearing down the church. The contamination survey of Chris Pine was correctly done as he assumed the industry standard position of Jesus on the cross.

The acting was good and then there was Chris Pine. The film moved slow. For people who want to watch an end of the world film with some minor religious discussion, the notion God will save a few people for his plan, and no zombies then this is it.

Please note, there is a latency period of ""puking"" and general sickness when one is exposed to radiation. The latency period depends on the amount of exposure from a week to immediately. If you are ""puking"" right away after exposure, you will die shorty. No medicine can save you.

The whole dang movie is a climax, slow to build and the ending just absolutely struck me. I guess not everyone will get it and that's okay but I hope you do.

7389008,4,B014DEGTEO,"I liked this movie very much but in no way can it be called an ""intense thriller"". The acting was great, the characters were very good, but it was more of a love triangle film than any sort of suspense movie.

I was expecting a bit more from the preview and the description because it led me to believe there were some sort of plot twists to be had from it.

If you watch it and understand that the movie doesn't go that direction, it's very good. I was not disappointed, but I did feel a little silly having told my husband that it was a thriller when it wasn't one.",1440806400,2,567,4.099099099099099
7389009,4,B014DEGTEO,"""Z For Zachariah"" (2015 release; 95 min.) brings the story of a couple of survivors of an unidentified contamination or radiation. As the movie opens, we see someone with a protective mask going through an empty town to pick up various things, including books from the library. When later the person takes off the mask, we see it is a young woman, named Ann.  Ann and her dog live on their own, tending to the land and surviving as best they can. Then Ann runs into another survivor, a man named John. When John inadvertently takes a swim in a contaminated lake, he becomes very ill. Ann takes him home and nurtures him back to health. At this point we are 15 minutes into the movie, but to tell you much more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, the movie's end titles say that the is ""Based on the book by Robert O'Brien"", but it would have been better to have said ""very loosely based on/inspired by Robert O'Brian's book"", as the plot for this film version differs dramatically and almost unrecognizably from the book. Since it is featured openly in the movie's trailer, besides Ann and John (the two characters in the book), the movie introduces a third character, Caleb. Second, while the setting of the movie is post-apocalyptic, the movie really doesn't feel all that much sci-fi. It's just three characters playing out their lives in an unspecified location somewhere in the US. In fact, the movie feels just as much being a Nicolas Sparks-like romantic drama than it is a sci-fi movie. Other elements featured in the movie include religion, and race. Third, the acting performances are strong. Up-and-coming Aussie actress Margo Robbie (also in The Wolf of Wall Street) does great work. She is definitely going places, that much is clear. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Chris Pine play John and Caleb, respectively. Fourth, the movie was mostly shot on location in New Zealand, with some additional shooting in West Virginia. Gorgeous sceneries most of the time. Last but certainly not least, there is a very nice orchestral score, composed by Heather ""The Instruments"" McIntosh.

I had been looking forward to seeing this movie, and it finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The matinee screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great. If you are in the mood for a romantic drama with a slight sci-fi twist, you'll definitely want to check this out. On the other hand, if you read and loved the book, you will absolutely want to avoid this.",1440806400,2,2593,4.732300884955753
7389010,1,B014DEGTEO,"I did not get into this movie, it was very slow paced. The movie starts out with some kind of world disaster without any explanation or background of what happened. (Sure that alone isn't important but its just one of many issues.) I didn't feel like there was any character development and the story didn't take me anywhere. Then ending had no conclusion or closure and left unanswered questions. Everyone is saying how the acting was great. Okay sure, i will give you that but what good is great acting to a bad story line or lack thereof. The entire movie felt like i walked into a movie 15 mins late, then left 30 mins before the movie ended. There was no setup, no introduction, and no ending or conclusion to the story. It was just a limited window into longer story at best.",1440806400,6,781,4.430555555555555

8730270,2,B014DEGTEO,"Certainly not the worst film I've seen, but very far from the best. The plot is extremely predictable. I don't want to spoil anything, but let me say that I was able to accurately predict the ending of the film just by reading its Amazon description.

The other gripe I have about this film is that it's so dry. Nothing ever happens. There wasn't a single tense moment implied between the characters that I empathized with. Possibly because it was such a predictable film. I already knew what was going to happen.",1515974400,,513,4.576086956521739
