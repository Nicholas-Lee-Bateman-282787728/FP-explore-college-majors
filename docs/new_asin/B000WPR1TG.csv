8225064,1,B000WPR1TG,"It is unfortunate to see a very hot topic selection from Drug Education like Designer Drug Presentation of this kind being very poorly done this way. I am disappointed at the way the video came out. I cannot see pictures of activities in the video during viewing. sounds, voices, and talks in the video are hardly audible. Everything seem out of place and poorly developed. Summarily the materials presented in the video are marred by technical problems resulting from very noisy audio (sound) and visual systems. Output of the visual or pictures  are blank or unclear with white glares. There is deep technical distortion in the recording systems of the film. Though the topic is very attractive for a serious drug education professional and student or patient I just cannot recommend the product to anyone because of its very poor quality.",1398556800,,841,4.964539007092198
