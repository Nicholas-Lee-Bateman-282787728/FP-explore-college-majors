7865612,5,6304242247,"The very last of the ten-hour ""Anthology"" series, but what we see here is what is the closure to ten hours of footage of the greatest band of the 20th century!  This tape contains footage of The Beatles playing ""Revolution,"" ""Hey Jude,"" ""The Long And Winding Road,"" and ""Let It Be.""  Another highlight is the Apple Rooftop gig in '69, the result of an attempt to do another concert for the closure to the ""Let it Be"" film.  Actually, ""One After 909,"" off the ""Let it Be"" album, is from that concert.  I'm very disappointed in John for not caring about the Beatles after they split up.  I'll quote his words from the tape:  ""People keep talking about it as if it's the end of the world; it's only a rock group that's split up.  It's nothing important.""  Paul, however, gives an excellent reflection on the band's songwriting.  I'll quote him too:  ""I'm really glad that most of our songs dealt with peace, love, understanding...there were hardly any that said, 'Go on kids, leave your parents.'  It was aqll very 'All you need is love.""  As good as this may be, I would try to get the whole box of Anthology tapes.  You want all the live performances from the early days.  Trust me.",1008633600,,1181,4.457943925233645
