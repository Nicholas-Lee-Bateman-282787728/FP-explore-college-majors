3574291,5,B001FB55LW,This is one of the Best Movies ever of jim carreys and its Great Movie,1231286400,4,70,3.7333333333333334
3574292,4,B001FB55LW,This is the funniest movie of the year. The combination of Jim and Zooey is fantastic. The scene with Danny Masterson and elderly neighbor is hilarious. I can't wait for DVD to come out. It's that good. If you looking for funny and entertaining. This is it.,1231200000,4,257,4.48936170212766
3574293,4,B001FB55LW,"I was intrigued by the plot of 'Yes Man', mostly because on the surface it looked an aweful lot like, 'Liar, Liar'--also a good Jim Carrey flick...but 'Yes Man' turned out to be different, at least enough to make it stand out from the crowd and loaded with enough laughs that I can genuinely recommend it to my friends with ONE Disclaimer: The scene with his elderly neighbor who requests the opportunity to help him sexually--it could have (and should have) been done by simply suggesting the deed rather than taking us to the bedroom and depicting it FOR us.

Other than that, 'Yes Man' provides enough giggles and outright belly-laughs to make it entirely worthwhile to see...especially if you are in the mood to just forget the world and laugh a little.  I enjoy a serious flick as much as the next guy, and while I prefer a good comedy to almost anything else, they seem to be in short supply these days--well, at least good ones are.

Don't look for Jim to get any nominations for acting awards here, but if you moderately like to see him overact like an imbecile, 'Yes Man' is just what you'll need to feel like the $[...] ticket and $[...] bucket of popcorn was actually worth what you paid...and as always, opinions DO vary.",1231200000,4,1233,4.545045045045045
3574294,4,B001FB55LW,"Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) is an exaggerated version of anyone who has difficulty committing to things (or people). The events in his life have caused him to shy away from any engagement, regardless of how innocent; something needs to change. Coincidentally Carl runs into an old friend who says that becoming a ""Yes Man"" has changed his life. A Yes Man, from the seminar Carl attends, is someone who takes a vow not to turn down any new opportunities, effectively saying ""yes"" to everything. Carl commits to changing his life; he takes the Yes Man vow and attacks life with new vigor.

I can understand that an actor wants to grow and continually take on new challenges, but Jim Carrey is so incredibly talented as a comedic leading man. Some people consider his more serious roles as worthwhile endeavors, but I disagree. The only move away from comedy that I have forgiven Mr. Carrey is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and I will go so far as to say that it is one of my favorite movies. Jim Carrey brings a funny movie to life. Yes Man is a blend of the funny and dramatic movies that Carrey has done. The movie is full of laughs, but it has a stomachable, if not endearing message. He does add a few of his (over-the-top) ad-lib moments, but you wouldn't watch Good Times and not expect Jimmie Walker to say ""Dy-no-mite!"" either.

Zooey Deschanel was perfect as the movie's leading lady. She provided the perfect amount of eccentricity to play Yin to Carl Allen's pre-vow Yang. She is cute and I am glad they didn't cast someone more socially-deemed ""beautiful"" to play this part, because it would not have been believable. She is great.

Rhys Darby was a great choice for Norman, Carl's boss. He was great in the part and the two costume parties he throws might have been the two main highlights of the movie for me. We'll see if this movie can give him a more mainstream American following than his work on Flight of the Conchords. He is very entertaining.

I took Yes Man in as a matinee with the family. Granted, it is a family that currently has no little children, but it was a great family movie. There were a lot of laughs and a tender moment or two for the romantics amongst us (but be wary of some offensive language). This is not an award-winning film, but I enjoyed it a good deal.",1230681600,,2302,4.486873508353222
3574295,4,B001FB55LW,"Carl's (Jim Carrey) got a problem.  He's ignoring phone calls from his friends, staying home every night watching rented movies.  He's in a rut at his job with the Brea Bank and going to get passed over for yet another promotion.  Truth is, he's depressed after his divorce from Stephanie (Molly Sims) and it's just not getting better.

Then he runs into a friend whose life has totally turned around.  He attends a YES seminar by charismatic Terence Bundley (Terence Stamp).  Participants are taught to say YES to life and all its experiences.

This changes Carl's life.  He's approving loans, learning Korean, taking up the guitar, learning to fly a plane.  Oh and yes, he meets Alison (Zooey Deschanel) who's with a techno band and an early morning jogging photographer's group.

But, there is a limit to being a yes man and Carl's got to learn it....

If you enjoy comedy with a life lesson, go see this film.  The audience was laughing.  I left there with sides aching and a smile on my face.

3574296,4,B001FB55LW,"Jim Carrey has had his good and bad moments; this is one of his good ones. In ""Yes Man,"" Carrey's trademark rubber-faced goofiness matures into humor that is still a bit zany, but in a more developed way than some of his previous comic performances.

Carrey plays Carl Allen, a divorced couch potato who prefers to mope around his apartment rather than go out and enjoy life. All this changes when an old friend drags him to a meeting hosted by motivational speaker Terrence Bundley, where Carl makes a fateful pledge to say ""yes"" to everything. That's right: EVERYTHING. Wacky adventures and awkward moments ensue, turning Carl's life upside down and leading him into a romance with a spontaneous, free-spirited indie musician named Allison.

This isn't a movie with a great deal of substance or intricate plot twists. Carl finds himself in one crazy situation after another, only discovering toward the end that his pledge has a downside greater than having to respond to an ad for a Persian mail order bride or spend a steamy morning with an elderly neighbor. As pure silly entertainment, ""Yes Man"" succeeds, with numerous laugh-at-loud moments and a lot of good chuckles in between.",1230249600,,1186,4.925
3574297,1,B001FB55LW,"This is a really mediocre film.  I didn't think the trailer was very funny and the movie is even worse.  If you want a Jim Carrey laugh fest then go rent his old stuff:  Ace Ventura, The Mask, Dumb & Dumber, Liar Liar, Me Myself and Irene.  All of those films have laugh out loud moments.

This is just awful.  Walking out I asked my family ""Can you remember anything funny in the movie we just saw?""  We were all at a loss to think of anything beyond a slight chuckle (compare that to something like ""Borat"" where I nearly choked to death laughing, with tears streaming down my face).

At multiple points today in the theatre I thought ""I'll walk out if anyone else with me mentions the idea"".  If you watch it on cable some day, I'm sure during the commercial breaks you'll forget what movie you're watching.  It's that bad.  No one in it and none of the characters are memorable in any way, shape or form.  Carrey's 2 friends have no purpose, and Carrey's boss as a nice guy makes no sense at all.  Then you've got Carrey, nice guy, playing off another nice guy...it's just pointless!  Why not make his boss some ruthless a-hole?  Then we'd at least have some conflict in this boring, boring film.

The love story is by the numbers and it's really a lot worse than the sub-par films Adam Sandler has been putting out lately.  I would say ""Click"", for example, was much better than this...and I would only say Click is passable entertainment.

But this just plain sucks.

You've been warned!",1229990400,5,1493,4.422794117647059
3574298,3,B001FB55LW,"Is it really healthy to say yes to everything? That seems to be the point ""Yes Man"" is trying to make. It tells the story of Carl Allen (Jim Carrey), a closed-off banker from Los Angeles who's challenged to accept whatever opportunities come his way, no matter what. The idea of expanding your horizons is a good one, although when you find yourself saying yes to things like Internet ads for penis enlargements or Persian mail-order brides, chances are you're taking the challenge a little too seriously. It's not about saying yes to everything--it's about saying yes when you know it feels right. What I find amazing is that this movie is based on a biography by British writer and humorist Danny Wallace, who spent six months accepting every offer in an attempt to make his life more interesting. Did he realize what kind of movie the Americans wanted to make? I guess it doesn't matter, not when you've practiced saying yes to everything.

Is this to say that Jim Carrey should have said no to ""Yes Man""? Let me answer that with a resounding maybe. It's by no means a great film, but it's not a terrible film, either; it's an occasionally amusing comedy that gives Carrey license to indulge in the goofy mannerisms he's become so famous for. In the course of the story, he gets drunk out of his mind, engages in a barroom brawl, and drinks enough Red Bull to keep him wired for an entire night. He even wraps tape around his head, distorting his face grotesquely. While not very inspired, you do have to admire an actor that can bring so much youthful energy into a role. I admire him, at least.

The plot: The always negative, recently divorced Carl runs into Nick (John Michael Higgins), an old friend who claims that a self-help guru inspired him to live his life to the fullest. He takes Carl to a Yes seminar hosted by the guru, named Terrence Bundley (Terence Stamp). Once the seminar begins, Bundley pressures Carl into accepting the Just Say Yes challenge. Now things start to get interesting. First, he gives a homeless man a lift, and when he asks for all of Carl's money, Carl willingly hands it over. Later on, he finally visits his elderly neighbor, Tillie (Fionnula Flanagan), who can do some pretty wild things with her mouth once she removes her dentures. He takes guitar lessons. He learns to speak Korean. At work, Carl begins accepting every loan request. He also says yes to his boss, Norman (Rhys Darby), who really seems to like themed costume parties.

One of the more pleasant outcomes of this new life philosophy is Allison (Zooey Deschanel), who Carl met at a gas station. Allison dabbles in a number of things. She paints. She rides a scooter. She does charity work. She's part of an unknown rock group called Munchausen By Proxy (some may call them edgy, but the reality is that they're untalented). She heads a small group that somehow combines a love of photography with a love of jogging; every morning at 6:00, she and her group run around Griffith Park with cameras in their hands. I know, it doesn't make much sense, but she seems to be getting something out of it. She's also falling in love with Carl. What she doesn't yet realize is the reason why he's saying yes to everything.

The only person who has any grasp of the situation is Carl's newly engaged best friend, Peter (Bradley Cooper). While he never appreciated Carl's refusal to do anything social, he doesn't agree with the yes-only philosophy he's now living by. He makes his point twice, first by announcing in a bar that Carl would be picking up the tab, second by asking him to plan his fianc&eacute;e's wedding shower. It isn't long before other friends start taking advantage of Carl; at that point, he finally begins to realize how blindly he's been going about this whole yes thing. It comes to a head on a spur-of-the-moment trip to Lincoln, Nebraska, when he's arrested on suspicion of being a terrorist.

So again, I ask: Is this something Jim Carrey should have said no to? I admit, the concept is kind of funny, and there were a few select moments that made me chuckle. But I never got as far as laughing out loud, probably because the film is geared more towards a younger, more easily amused crowd. The one I was with certainly had a ball, especially later in the film, when Carl ended up on a motorcycle dressed in nothing but a hospital gown. The bike's powerful torque was apparently not as funny as the revealing nature of the gown. And after reaching his destination, making tire marks on the pavement, and walking slow motion out of the smoke, the audience actually applauded. Yes, there's nothing more exciting than a scantily clad comedian walking away from a motorcycle.

Did Danny Wallace do any of this? How should I know? I haven't read his book. But given his stature as an author, do you think he could see ""Yes Man"" and think it's funny? I once again find myself turning to maybe as an answer. Incidentally, that word plays a very important role near the end of the film, which is very fitting in my opinion; it tells me that even the filmmakers were unsure about what they were dealing with. Let me put it this way: If you consistently get your money's worth out of Jim Carrey comedies, then chances are you'll have fun watching this movie. If not, then it's entirely your call. The ads say that yes is the new no, but I think that might be pushing it.",1229731200,,5383,4.578838174273859
3574299,4,B001FB55LW,"Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) is a lonely guy.  Carl is a loan officer who is real low on life and down in the dumps because of a break up.  One day Carl heeds the advice of an old friend and goes to a self-help seminar.  The motto ""Yes is the new no!""  If the movie's title is any indicator, you know what happens for the rest of the film.  He says yes to anything and everything, even an extremely generous granny.

Not very often a comedy comes out with a message worth listening to.  ""Yes Man"" provides just that and exposes the audience to the powers of positive thinking.  The movie itself is a montage of Carl saying yes to everything; Carl says yes to learning to speak Korean, Carl says yes to costume party invites from his boss, Carl says yes to flying lessons, and yes to a bar fight, which was one of the funniest scenes of Carl's acceptance journey.  Eventually, Carl's yes-ery leads to a new love interest named Allison (Zooey Deschanel) and a promotion at work.  And despite all the positive outcomes, Carl learns that saying yes doesn't always necessarily take you in the right direction.

""Yes Man"" is a lot of fun to watch.  Carrey is on top of his game and is still as funny as always.  To answer any questions:  Yes the movie is funny.  Yes it's worth going to see.  And yes you'll enjoy it.",1229644800,58,1306,4.31275720164609
3574300,4,B001FB55LW,"I had a chance to see an advance screening of Yes Man last night and I have to say it's one of his best comedies since Me, Myself & Irene. I've always been a fan of Jim Carey, whether he's doing juvenile comedy like Ace Venture or adult orientated drama like the highly underrated Man On The Moon; & Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. Making his first live action film since Fun With Dick & Jane, Carey once again shows his talent as a comic. Early trailers have the film coming off as a Liar Liar rehash, but looking deeper the film is more about than belly laughs and one-liners.  It's refreshing to see Carey bring freshness to a role he could easily play in his sleep; one particular scene with Scotch tape had the preview audience in tears. Zooey Deshuncaal more than makes up for the debacle that was The Happening and displays the same likeable charm she displayed in Elf, and hopefully she continues to play romantic leads in the future. All in all this is a fine film and if you're looking for a break from the profanity filed gross out comedies of recent memory, then say yes to Yes Man.",1228953600,2,1101,4.3707317073170735

3574813,4,B001FB55LW,"Jim Carrey - much like his comedic counterparts - is one of those actors you either love or hate. Personally, I haven't found many movies he didn't at least raise the bar for, and this one is no exception. Yes, it's gimmicky and a little stupid, but there's a certain charm in the idea of saying yes to life instead of being a perpetual nay-sayer. The only thing that really didn't work for me is the scene with the song from Journey, which was a seriously painful faux-pas. Beyond that, it was chockful of hearty laughs as Carrey once again brought his particular brand of hilarity to the big screen. It's certainly good entertainment - better than some of the other laughably inept attempts at humor that seem to disgrace both the big and small screens these days...",1466812800,,768,4.572463768115942

3575086,5,B001FB55LW,"I LOVE this movie! It's more of a movie to me, it's an inspiration. I can honestly say that this is one of my all-time favorite movies and it's really a simple story. A guy that's basically a shut-in and avoids social interaction has his life changed when he goes to a ""YES!"" convention.

This movie is rather quirky at times, but that's to be expected since Jim Carrey always gives a physical comedy performance and Zooey Deschanel is overall a cute and quirky person. There are some ridiculous parts but I don't think it ever goes over-the-top. The F word does get dropped once which was a little disappointing to me since I think this would be a good movie for teenagers to see too because I find it to be very motivational and inspirational.

I recommend this movie to those who want a fun and inspirational comedy. There are tons of pop culture references (like Harry Potter, Blockbuster, and Third Eye Blind) so I'm sure some people will really enjoy this movie for the nostalgia factor. I honestly can't see too many people not liking this movie but for me it's definitely on my top 10 list of favorite movies.",1447027200,,1117,4.524752475247524

It was shipped on time, so that was the one and only positive thing I can say about them. When I first received the product, I opened the box it came in and remove the clear wrap around the blu-ray case, only to discover a slice through the plastic approximately 2-3 inches long. It came close to the the actual disc, so I returned the item. No issues there, I received another copy by the delivery date. To my surprise, this new case had almost an identical slice through the plastic case. But this time there were plenty of stickers to hide the fact it was there. I am very disappointed in the fact that this company does not care enough to check their products prior to shipping them to their customers.

This movie has an interesting concept.
In fact, believe it or not, it helped me to pull out of a bad, long lasting depression.
I saw myself in this guy. I realized I say no to everything. I realized I'm dying mentally.
I tried this idea. I started saying YES to everything and a few month later I was out of depression.
Good movie. Good motivation...",1425081600,,399,4.2631578947368425

3575455,4,B001FB55LW,"Yes Man is a romantic comedy directed by Peyton Reed and it was written by Nicholas Stoller, Jarrad Paul, and Andrew Mogel. It is based loosely on the book of the same title by British humorist Danny Wallace.

Carrey stars as Los Angeles bank loan officer Carl Allen has become withdrawn since his divorce from ex-wife Stephanie. Routinely ignoring his friends Pete and Rooney,he has an increasingly negative outlook on his life. One day, an old colleague suggests that he goes to a ""Yes!"" seminar with him, which encourages its attendants to seize the opportunity to say ""Yes!"". Carl considers the option, but subsequently misses Pete's engagement party. An irate Pete turns up at his house and berates him, telling him that he will end up completely lonely if he does not change his life. Carl decides to attend the seminar and meets inspirational guru Terrence Bundley, who publicly browbeats him into making a covenant with himself. Carl reluctantly promises to stop being a ""No Man"" and vows to answer ""Yes!"" to every opportunity, request or invitation that presents itself thereafter.

There are flat performances in the film. The only exception is that of Jim Carrey's comic convulsions which are the only bright spots in this otherwise dim and predictable comedy. Also,it has false situations and bad lines, but the laughs are there and the message about change and personal transformation are timeless.",1420416000,,1411,5.051502145922747

3575944,5,B001FB55LW,"I never thought I would love this movie, but after renting it on Netflix I turned around and bought it on Amazon.  That's how important I feel this movie is - I want to own it and show it to my friends and family in the months to come.

To be honest, Jim Carey's usual movie formula is too manic for my tastes.  For every sensible Bruce Almighty or Truman Show there is an over-the-top Ace Ventura, and I'm one of those who don't go in for crude humor and middle-school plotting.  But in an outing more aligned to Carey's ""Liar Liar,"" we find ""Yes Man"" follows the life an ordinary, reasonable man thrown into an extraordinary situation.  And as he learns and grows, so we in the audience learn and grow with him.  I found the experience both exciting and thought-provoking.

Without giving too much of a spoiler: imagine being challenged to just say YES to any opportunity that comes your way?  Now imagine being so lost and desperate, that you have nothing to lose by saying Yes to what presents before you?  Now what if - against all reason and common sense - the path you followed - the dominos you set in motion by going down the path - lead to bigger and better life experiences and rewards than you would ever have been able to accomplish by 'playing it safe'?

This movie takes us on that kind of trip.  Assisted by the ever-charming pixie-ish Zooey Deschanel and an equally charming cast, Jim learns that the most unlikely choices can lead to incredible outcomes.  There IS place for the path less taken and the beat of the different drummer.

If you need a little more poetry and derring-do in your life, add this movie to your collection.  It was a sleeper at the box-office, but big screenings is not where a film like this belongs.  It earns a solid place in my collection because it delivers on the small scale, up close and personal, and I am the better for having seen this film.  Give it a try - see how it effects you too.",1376784000,,1940,4.377094972067039

3576141,5,B001FB55LW,"""Yes Man"" (2008) - Directed by Peyton Reed.  Rated PG-13 for crude sexual humor, language, and Jim Carrey's backside as seen in an ICU robe (which is why they call it ""I see you."")  Starring Jim Carrey, Zooey Deschanel. Bradley Cooper, Fionnula Flanagan, Terrence Stamp, Vivian Bang, Sasha Alexander, Rhys Darby, Danny Masterson, Brent Briscoe, and others.
A guy challenges himself to say ""yes"" to everything for an entire year.  Loosely based on Danny Wallace's autobiographical book (he makes a cameo appearance in the film).
Jim Carrey doesn't exactly hit a home run out of the ballpark every movie he makes, but this time he got it right.  This film is a feel good flick that makes an excellent compromise for when wives and girlfriends insist on their guy watching a ""chick flick"" with them.  Both sides of that equation can thoroughly enjoy  ""Yes Man.""  Seriously, say yes, to ""Yes Man.""
Shortly after the end credits begin, there is a short scene in which Carl (Jim Carrey) and Allison (Zooey Deschanel) ride down a mountain road on body skates (31-wheel roller suits, the genuine article invented by Jean Yves Blondeau).  Looks like fun, if ever there would be a place where somebody could actually take on that level of experience and not run into some serious mountain pass traffic.

3576142,3,B001FB55LW,"The bargain rack movie for last night was ""Yes Man"" starring Jim Carrey. Needless to say, it was a comedy but it really wasn't all that funny. The rubber-faced comedian was amusing here and there and also touching. It was a mildly interesting, mildly amusing movie, but one that will be forgotten a week or two from now.

Carrey played an in-the-rut guy who declined all invitations to do things and sat at home watching DVDs every night. I can identify with that. Also his professional and romantic life was in dead in the water. Hmmm. I can identify with that too. Perhaps a great deal of us could see ourselves in that same kind of rut. In any case, a friend of his got him to attend a motivational meeting where the speaker forcefully induced him to always say yes rather than no. Hence, the ""Yes Man"" title and then the series of events and changes that took place after this abrupt reorientation. It's amusing. His new-found girlfriend Zooey Deschanel was charming and fun to watch. The story was frivolous, but enjoyable late night entertainment. Hmmm. I wonder if there are any motivational speakers like this in San Diego?

And the super funny red-head ""agent"" from Flight of the Concords is in it too and plays an equally quirky character.  Also, if you love LA or have ever lived there, this movie is shot in so many great places, like Griffith Park, Spaceland, the Hollywood Bowl - it will make you nostalgic for LA.  I can't believe it's only like $5?  That doesn't even make sense - Oh Amazon how I love you.

I watched this movie at the theater during its release week, then watched it several times after that and STILL ended up buying the BluRay. It was just great, and really funny! I couldn't stop myself from laughing at the theater, really. The concept is new and original. A man that says no to everything and has to go out of his way to say yes to everything from now on. That clearly turns his life upside down. Zooey Deschanel kept reminding me of Katy Perry, and don't tell me they don't look alike because they do! I believe this was the very first movie I watched of hers (500 Days of Summer and Your Highness came later) and it was a really good first impression. All in all, I loved it.

After I watched this, I took a singing class, and hey, it just happens that I'm pretty good at it. I do recommend this movie to viewers who are looking at the downside of life at the moment.

This could have been mined for great comedic laughs especially given Jim Carrey is the lead actor here. Sadly, the script is terrible. The worse is the last 20 minutes where it devolves into some sort of pining woe-is-me before, of course, the happy ending.

The cast is pretty decent and deserved better. Having said that the lead actress Zooey (yep, that's her name) Deschanel is not very appealing. She plays a character with her own quirks but it's so low key you'd think she's comatose at times. She also is very unbelievable when she tries for angry in a scene.

No extras at all on this version of the DVD and, frankly, if you do make it through this movie without fast-forwarding any of it, Warner Bros. should give you a medal or something.",1314835200,,887,4.503105590062112

There are a few specific scenes (won't spoil them for you!) that I rewound a thousand times & laughed my head off!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie!  It also has a really great message to it as well!

Although the movie never truly made me laugh out loud consistantly like ""Ace Venture"" or ""Liar, Liar"" I still found the movie to be funny.  I think it hit the spot for comedy movies and I will watch it over and over again for its entertainment value.

What I liked most of the movie is Zoe Deschanel. Yet again she made the character her own. Giving a quarkiness to her character in ""Yes Man"", as she usually does; which is a major part of her charm.

The supporting actors do a solid job, although none do an excellent job.  But they all add to the movie as a whole.

Storyline wise the movie was your prototypical Jim Carrey comedy movie.  So if you like Jim Carrey Humor you will most definately like this movie.

I just bought this elsewhere online to pick up at their retail store (hint: it was the *Best* price) and when I got it, I saw that there is no digital copy, EVEN THOUGH THE UPC NUMBER IS IDENTICAL. The original cover art had a sleeve (I think) with ""Digital Copy (Blu-ray Disc symbol) Special Edition"" at the top, with Jim Carrey bungee-jumping off a bridge. The newer version that I received is Jim Carrey walking through a field with his arms outstretched.

After about an hour of research and wondering if I should return it and start trying again to get it cheap on eBay while avoiding used copies (seller having used the digital copy) or just to keep the darn thing, if you look at Amazon's image of the back cover here and zoom in, it says, ""(Digital copy) Offer expires April 6, 2010"".

So, kudos to Amazon for having readable back cover art, and BOO! to the studios for limiting digital copy availability and not changing the UPC code. Bad studio, bad!",1280707200,3,1006,4.516483516483516
3576295,4,B001FB55LW,"Generally speaking, I run (screaming) from Jim Carrey movies.  This dude wore out his welcome back when Nirvana was cranking out hits.  Yet Jim's lone salvation in the comedy YES MAN is delectable and cuddly cute Zooey Deschanel; playing a free spirit romantic interest Zooey is a wonderful counter to Carrey's overplayed antics.  Which makes YES MAN an enjoyable experience, as a shallow loan officer who constantly says ""No"" to lenders has his life transformed via a rowdy seminar (like that plot's never been done before) and commits to saying ""Yes"" to everything he's asked.  Meanwhile he enters into a romance with very predictable results.

While Carrey often gets chalkboard-scraping annoying, he does exhibit (on occasion) a delightful rustic charm.  For example, his guitar serenade to prevent a disturbed Luis Guzman from jumping off a ledge is the film's best feel-good moment.  There are similar little gems interspersed throughout the movie (an encounter with an elderly lonely neighbor being one of them) to offset Carrey's perpetual mayhem.  There's a sizable supporting cast (with only Terrence Stamp and Guzman standing out from the crowd) and the story is so predictable you can set your watch to it, yet YES MAN is fun because Zooey is so cute you forget Carrey's around.

It's not much of a thinking movie, basically what happens is that Jim Carrey is sort of a stuck up and boxed in type of guy, who winds up at this seminar where he discovers the power of always saying YES to everything.
The movie sort of flows along, without much conflict at all. It's almost as if, if you really went along and just said yes to everything, that life would be perfect. Yet,,, still full of laughs.

Carreys boss in the movie, a character named Norm cracks me up everytime. And Zooey Deschnal (spelling?) as usual is the love of my life. Sure she was good in 500 Days of Summer, but I enjoyed her character a lot more in this one, and the way she mixed with the style and timing of Carrey works perfectly. Theres Hyde from the seventies show and the dude from The Hangover too as Carreys close friends.  There is some conflict between the romance at the end, but the positive and upbeat swing of the story never stops. Just say yes to this one.

3576298,2,B001FB55LW,"The success of a movie is, like phrases and clothing styles, all about timing.  For example, this latest comedy by Jim Carrey would have been great if it was released in 1990.  But coming out in 2008, after other Carrey films such as The Mask, Me Myself and Irene, and Bruce Almighty, this movie actually seems like a rehash of Carrey's previous films.  In The Mask, Carrey plays a meek bank employee who after encountering a mask, becomes an alpha male that takes everything he wants.  In Me, Myself and Irene, Carrey plays a pushover police officer who occasionally morphs into an aggressive alter-ego.  And in Bruce Almighty, Carrey plays a passive reporter who meets God, and suddenly relishes his new powers.  Notice the recurring theme?  Well, it gets transplanted into this movie in its full entirety.  Carrey plays Carl, a bank employee (again) who is a shy introvert loser.  He goes to a meeting by an inspirational speaker, and his life suddenly turns around.  Now he is extroverted, outgoing, with a happening life.  And of course there is the love interest, this time played by the cool, calm Zooey Deschanel.  To sum it up, this movie is a rehash of Carrey's previous comedies, except less funny.  It lacks the spontaneity of Me, Myself and Irene.  It does not have the zaniness of The Mask, and it does not have the great casting of Bruce Almighty.  Overall, a waste of 2 hours watching this movie.",1276041600,,1412,4.706122448979592

The plot is basically that Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) works in a bank where he just says ""No"" to everybody who wants a loan. Since his girlfriend dumped him he has become even more negative, saying ""No"" to virtually anything. His friends Peter (Bradley Cooper) and Rooney (Danny Masterson, Hyde from The 70's Show) are getting sick of him, especially when he blows off Peter's engagement party in spite of the open bar.

Terrance singles him out of the crowd and gets him to agree to a covenant. He has up until now been saying ""No"" to life, but now he must say ""Yes"" instead. Once he begins doing this his life dramatically changes. Even if things start to go bad, it leads to something good. He meets the spontaneous Allison (Zooey Deschanel) and is in for the ride of his life.

Yes Man is right up there with the greatest Jim Carrey films. It has a serious concept, but doesn't skimp on the comedy. The Cable Guy was Carrey's Citizen Kane, as I have said many times before, but it was quite dark and not everyone ""got"" it. The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was another triumph, but Carrey was very low key in it, suppressing his inner Ace Ventura. The Truman Show was a noble experiment that failed. Too much high concept, not enough low brow humor. Man in the Moon was another failed experiment that paid homage to the edgy humor of Andy Kaufman but tried to wrap it up in a package that would entertain the lowest common denominator, which is a self-defeating proposition. Dumb & Dumber was in my opinion a masterpiece of the broad comedy Carrey does so well, unencumbered by any higher aspirations whatsoever. However, in Yes Man Carrey has found that sweet spot right in between broad comedy and a more serious film with a message.

------------
Carl Allen: What I have to share is huge... and I want to share it with you.
========

Yes Man is based on a book by British Author Danny Wallace who spent a year saying ""Yes"" to every proposition and question he was asked, and then wrote about the results. Carrey and Director Peyton Reed spent a lot of time developing the story and changing it to an American setting. Carrey was really inspired by the message of the film and acted without pay, though he would get a share of the profits. He gave it his all, even breaking some ribs in a stunt. The stunt woman for Zooey Deschanel also broke her hip while riding a scooter, so Zooey had to ride it herself. The whole cast really gave an outstanding effort with superb results. Rhys Darby played Carl's boss Norman, and I'll compare him to Peter Sellers at the risk of hyperbole.

------------
Allison: [singing with her band, Munchausen's By Proxy] Don't call me past 11 PM, it won't happen again. Happened once, it happened twice, it happened three times, maybe four times, maybe five times, maybe, maybe it happened six times, but it won't happen seven times.
========

Oh, Zooey. You were once again adorable, and this was a perfect role for you. A role that requires singing a little, like (500) Days of Summer, or Elf, comedy, acting, and just being cute. In some ways you were playing yourself, but no one can play you better. You are an actress who sings, but it's not like your music is some lame vanity project. I like your movies and your music both. Catch Zooey in He & She with M. Ward if you want to hear more of her music.

Just say ""Yes."" Get a case of Red Bull (it goes great with Vodka) and watch Yes Man. Just don't start watching it after 11 PM, or you might be up until the dawn, like I was writing this review.

Carl Allen: You ever had a Red Bull? I've never had a Red Bull before, but I had a Red Bull last night - I really like Red Bull.

3576375,4,B001FB55LW,"Jim Carey got very depressed and anti social after his ex-wife divorced him. He lived his depressing life every day until one of his friends talked him into attending an inspirational seminar called Yes Man. In this seminar, Jim made a pact with himself that he would say yes to everything in his life, no matter how weird or dangerous the situation is. He started doing that, and his life changed very positively and got very interesting.

The morale behind this film is that we should conquer our inner fears and say yes to things we really want to do deep inside but are afraid of. If you want to ask someone to marry you but you're afraid of rejection, go for it, at least you will know how she feels about you. If you never ask her, youl will stay all your life wondering what she would have answered.

After missing his best friend's engagement party, he has an epiphany and allows himself to be dragged to a ""Yes man"" seminar, where he learns to say yes to everything.

I watched this movie over vacation, and decided it was good enough to review. Basically, it's Jim Carrey in another wild movie about a man who denies life, but in a strange turn of events, becomes a YES MAN, and can't refuse anything- no matter what.

Leading to some funny, ridiculous scenarios and some classic Jim Carry scenes, there was certainly some very funny scenes in this movie, and the relationship between Jim's and Zooey's characters is very sweet and believable. And yet it wasn't the kind of movie I'd want to buy.

It's really just the kind of movie you should rent every once in awhile, because the funniness of Carrey didn't envelope the whole movie, and it didn't feel like one of his best. With some slow moments and a bizarre sex scene between, well, Jim's character and an old lady, it's not one of my favorites.

So it's a definite watch, but not exactly a good buy. The acting was alright and the funniness usually made me laugh, but there was something weird about it that just didn't click- and why this isn't on my movie shelf.",1261958400,,1120,4.502463054187192

** Warning: Movie Spoiler Ahead **

1) After attending a seminar, Carl (Jim Carrey) decided to try to say ""YES"" to everything anybody would say or ask of him, so a homeless person asked him to give him a ride to some where up in the mountain, and asked him for all his money, and Carl said ""Yes"", and due to this, his car didn't start and he walked down the mountain to get some gasoline and right there, he met a girl who kept on talking to him and gave him a ride, let him wear her motorbike helmet, and kissed him mouth to mouth after giving him the ride.

2) He somehow ran into this girl again, and they were to meet the next morning, but Carl's friend asked him to go drink energy drinks for an ""all-nighter"", so Carl said ""YES"" and went, and the next morning, showed up somewhat crazy and the girl liked it, because he is ""special"".

3) Carl is a loan officer at a local bank, so he started saying ""YES"" to anybody, for any loan at all.  Because of this, the bank's upper management decided he was doing a great job and sent somebody over and asked him to go work at the corporate office instead.

This sounds too much like ""wishful thinking"".  In fact, when in elementary school, many of us dared not to say no, and it is only when we grow up, some teachers and friends gave advice that ""we should not say YES to everybody and for everything, but decide on how we live our life.""

Even 10, 15 years ago, you would hear conversation like this:  Tom: ""He is a great guy!""  Michael: ""No, he is just a Yes Man"".

So far it seemed to work for Jim Carrey, because the Yes Man was pretty funny.  It's about a man (Jim Carrey of course) who has to say ""YES"" to everything.  This includes ALL questions asked by everyone.  This can include having to say yes to his neighbor (an old lady who knows a thing or two about making love), his workmates (one of them being a Harry Potter fanatic) and his girlfriend (whom he met at a gas station while riding a motorcycle).

I do miss the old version of Jim Carrey where he was just an insanely goofy person, but with good writing to back up his behavior so the writing in those old movies had a purpose at least.  Yes Man is a very minor disappointment in that regard, but not enough to take away from all the times I was sitting there laughing while watching it tonight.

The film does a really nice job covering a variety of different locations, and having Carrey's character interact with a variety of interesting people.  I like that.  It makes the story that much more interesting when Jim Carrey has to say yes to everything.

Maybe the writers could have found funnier ways for Jim Carrey to say yes involving funnier segments and questions, but that's a small complaint because in the end this is a movie I recommend you watch with your family, and a film all Jim Carrey fans should be able to appreciate.",1258156800,,1618,4.510273972602739

The story involves a depressed, negative man (Carrey) who is forced by a self-help guru (Terence Stamp) to agree to everything everyone asks him to do. If ""Yes Man"" were merely a typical Hollywood ""comedy"" that mistook frenzy for laughs, I could have borne it. But ""Yes Man"" crosses over far too often into the realms of the offensive. The ""jokes"" include one of the most distasteful sex scenes in cinematic history (you'll know it when you see it) and a scene between Carrey and a German shepherd that conjures images of that perennial laff riot, Abu Ghraib.

In the film, Jim Carrey plays an emotionally closed down man who has fallen into the habit of saying no to everything, until he's convinced by a cheesy self-help guru to make a ""covenant"" with life to say yes to everything.

One might expect the movie to be something really zany given Jim Carrey's typical brand of humor (which I felt smothered the humor in a similar film he was in years back called ""Liar, Liar), but for the most part I thought it was a little more serious than that...to the point where when it did veer into craziness, that seemed a bit out of place and contrived.  I finished watching this thinking that it might have been interesting if the story had played it completely straight and shown both the good and the bad resulting from living one's life as a ""yes man.""  That's because I discovered about five years ago when I watched Carrey give the best performance of his career in ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" he can do ""serious"" leavened with a touch of humor as well as if not better than his manic shtick.

Jim plays the lead as Carl Allen a negative man, stays at home,  newly divorced, shuns friends, and has no initiative and a bad attitude at work.  He wants to contain his life, and not take on any new projects.

He runs into an old friend one night who brings him to a seminar on saying ""Yes"" to life.  The positivity ""Yes"" leader asks who are new attendees and picks Carl out of the audience.  He walks over to where Carl is sitting as Carl said ""No"" he would not come up on the stage.  One-on-One, in front of thousands the Yes Guru talks to Carl and makes a covenant for him to say Yes, that good things will happen.  Bad things will happen when he says no.

At first Carl grudgingly embraces saying Yes - but soon realizes good things happen when he helps people.  Carl becomes a man who says Yes - and cannot say no.

He meets a quirky young woman (Zooey Deschanel) on a motorcycle who happens to sing rock music, and take photos while jogging at the break of dawn, he learns guitars, learns a new language, learns to play the guitar, helps an elderly neighbor lady,

I was pleasantly surprised how Cary played the lead.  He was not overacting and was realistic in the character he played.  His free-spirited girlfriend (Zooey)  was just right for the part.

His boss Norm is played by Rhys Derby and Bradley Cooper plays Carl's supportive best buddy.",1250467200,,1613,4.355704697986577
3576538,1,B001FB55LW,"The film is based around a frustrated middle aged man ""Carl"" whose life changes after attending a self help seminar that requires attendees to say ""yes"" to new opportunities in their lives.

The key theme of the movie is built around the notion that for the character universally agreeing to everything will improve his life (SANJI: ""I want you to do something for me, Carl. Tomorrow, I want you only to say yes. Can you do that for me?"").
At various occasions throughout the script the characters show the futility of the overall concept when they don't follow through the ""yes to everything notion"": i.e. when asked if he ""hates his country"" he disagrees although at that stage in the story Carl should have learnt that ""saying yes"" is the only option to avoid negative consequences. So, the overall idea of the story definitely falls in the ""rather infantile"" category.

Sometimes lack of story can be recovered by witty or funny dialogue and interesting character development. Unfortunately ""Yes Man"" doesn't offer either. Rarely have I had to endure more stereotypical, predictable character development (bad unlikeable guy changes his life and finds love on the way"" and dialogue that is so blatantly stupid and truly just not funny despite desperate aims to be that.

I cannot be accused of not being a fan of politically incorrect elements in stories but I just could not see any necessity of scenes were in a detailed fashion (multiple minutes) the topic of forced oral sex of the character with a 70+ toothless lady is covered. In addition to all that movie includes an ""orgy of product placement"" to an extent that I have never seen before. The sad climax of this is a scene that goes on for more than half a minute with the Red Bull energy drink at its centre. It feels like somebody has accidently edited in a commercial product ad into a professional feature film.

Finally: I have tried hard to find anything of value in this story and related movie. Unfortunately I have failed and can only warn everyone not to waste ninety valuable minutes of her/his life on this movie horribly gone wrong...",1249603200,13,2110,4.772602739726027

Will Carl be able to maintain the satisfactory results into saying ""Yes"" to everything, or will he have to break the covenant and eventually be forced to say ""No"" and go back to living a miserable life?

Now, Jim Carrey seems to be doing many of these romantic comedies lately but you know what?  It's still darned funny and was absolutely worth checking out.  The film was grandiose a lot of the time once Carrey's character learned to say ""yes"" to everything but the whole story is well supported from start to finish and there never was a dull moment.

""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" is one of my favorite movies, while I didn't care for ""Cable Guy"". ""Yes Man"" is probably most similar to ""Liar Liar"" - it allows Carrey to use his knack for physical comedy without overusing it. His bits fit in with the story rather than becoming the story.

Carrey plays Carl, a guy who basically hides from the world, turning down invites to dinners, parties, and just about everything else. His close friends tolerate this to some degree, but appear to be close to the breaking point. Carl's life changes dramatically when he attends a motivational seminar which encourages people to say ""yes"" to EVERYTHING, an idea Carl follows blindly. Of course this results in a variety of events, good and bad, including meeting Allison (played by the always refreshing Zooey Deschanel), a zany lead singer who also leads a group of photographers who photograph the sunrise...while jogging. Eventually there are (predictably) repercussions from Carl not actually considering his responses and weighing his options.

If you liked Carrey in at least some of his comedy movies, I would recommend this one. There were some dramatic moments, but largely it's a comedy that'll make you laugh.",1248825600,,1291,4.972222222222222
3576611,3,B001FB55LW,"Jim Carrey is an iconic comedian. Like it or lump it, he has forever left his mark on Hollywood with films like ""Ace Ventura,"" ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""Man on the Moon,"" but since the turn of the century Jim has been wasting away with duds like ""Me, Myself, and Irene"" and ""Fun with Dick and Jane."" Granted, he's put in some great dramatic performances during this time, notably ""Eternal Sunshine"", but his attempts at diving back into the genre that made him a movie star have been unadulterated failures.

Where, then, does ""Yes Man"" stack up? Is it a worthy ode to the Jim Carrey that we all fell in love with in the mid-90s, or yet another film in which Jim Carrey appears to be doing an imitation of himself? I'm happy to say that while it falls somewhere in the middle, it's certainly Jim's best comedy since ""Liar Liar,"" and is actually fairly close to that movie in both concept and enjoyment.

Carrey plays Carl, a recently-divorced loan officer who has become all too comfortable with denying the requests of anyone, both at work and in his personal life. He has resigned himself to spending his time away from others, forgoing any and all opportunities that exist outside his palatial bachelor pad. He's watched his ex-wife find love again, and while he clearly misses the feeling, he isn't in the right headspace for finding it himself.

After a somewhat clunky opening act, Carl finds himself at a ""Yes Man"" seminar, during which he is told to ""allow 'Yes' into his life."" After this bizarre presentation by Terrence Stamp, Jim reluctantly finds himself saying ""yes"" to whatever proposals come his way. He gives all of his pocket money to a homeless man, starts handing out loans at work with reckless abandon, and even takes up an elderly woman on an...offer.

Predictably, Carl's life is rejuvenated, and he finds himself satisfied with himself for the first time in a while. Although the plot moves along pretty much how you'd expect, Carrey is in fine form here. The laughs come often and are sometimes of the gut-wrenching variety. Zooey Deschanel is delightfully droll in her role as Alison, the quirky foil to the often insipid Carl.

Before watching the film, the concept of saying ""yes"" to anything seemed to me like an excuse to throw Carrey into the most ridiculous predicaments imaginable, just to watch how he'd fair in such situations. But as the movie progressed I found myself thinking seriously about the concept itself, and how much value one could actually extract out of such a philosophy. The concept serves as a gimmick, sure, but it also provides a worthwhile commentary on apathy and how destructive it can be. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a film that will change your life, but the concept is smarter than one might assume.

As far as supporting roles go, the best performance of the entire film--one that I'd even recommend a viewing based solely on--is that of Rhys Darby, who plays Carl's boss Norman. His character is much like his portrayal of Murray from ""Flight of the Concords,"" meaning that humor is derived solely from his New Zealand accent poured over amusing innocence. He had me in stitches every time he was on the screen.

Other than Darby, there aren't any other notable performances to speak of. Bradley Cooper and Danny Masterson play Carl's best friends, but their roles are very minimal, almost to the point of being irrelevant. They largely serve as the locus of Carl's apathy, but little more. It's too bad, as I like both of these actors, and I think the film could have benefitted from us seeing more of them (and Masterson's killer 'stache).

Ultimately, the film was set up to succeed or fail on the backs of Carrey and Deschanel. Thankfully, they're great, both apart and, especially, together. They had a chemistry that I wasn't quite expecting. If you're a fan of either, then I'm sure that you'll enjoy ""Yes Man.""

3576619,5,B001FB55LW,"Jim Carrey was once an actor who elicited endless bouts of laughing fits that usually resulted in one being bent over on the couch on the verge of peeing in ones pants.

Or so I hear.

To be completely honest, I've never been a huge fan of the whole `zany is funny' approach to comedy.  Sure, every once in a while a mindless film that filters gag after gag is a nice escape from reality, but I prefer my comedy to have a little more substance.  Even at that, I could never deny the fact that Carrey had what it took to do what he did better than most other people.  I may not be the biggest fan of `Ace Ventura' or `The Cable Guy' or even `Dumb and Dumber', but I respect what this man can do.  He is, without doubt, considered a comedic god to many.  Personally though, I have come to admire what Jim has been able to do with smarter, more subdued comedies.  His performances in films like `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' and `The Truman Show' are leagues better than what he's done in any of his big Blockbuster smash hits.

As of late, Carrey's star has seemed to kind of fade away.  His newer movies are not as big and or as exciting as his older ones, and as he increases in age he has found himself replaced by the new generation of slapstick stars.

Because of that, you may not have given `Yes Man' the time of day.

Even before it was released, rumors of this being nothing but a `Liar, Liar' rip off were everywhere.  Beings that I was not a huge fan of `Liar, Liar' to begin with (I found it only marginally funny) I was not really all that excited about this film and so I wrote it off.  Then I noticed that it co-stared the amazingly talented and absolutely gorgeous Zooey Deschanel (who I would sit through anything to see) and I decided to give it a try.  Cuddled up on a couch with my wife and my best friend we popped this bad boy in and prepared ourselves for a letdown.

That letdown never came.

What is so great about `Yes Man' is that it plays to every one of Carrey's strengths without letting them get the better of him.  He begins the film a very subdued character, and so when he starts to venture into `zany' territory he is reeled in by his character's demeanor.  He never goes overboard, which saves this film from becoming a random clich&eacute;.  Instead, he pulverizes us with physical comedy that works, with new age wit that works and with actual human emotion that sells because his character seems much more down to earth than a lot of the freaks he's played in the past.  Deschanel is sweet and charming and everything a man could ever want and need and so she complements Carrey's transformation very well; and the script is actually all sorts of clever.  Sure, there are moments of clich&eacute;d and obvious `borrowing' from other possibly better films, but for the most part this one actually works very hard to be something memorable.

If you like what Carrey is capable of when handed the right script then see this movie.  It's one of his better films in recent years, certainly his best since `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'.  Sure, it has nothing on that film (they are totally different), but for what it attempts to be, it is aces all the way.",1245024000,3,3208,4.36026936026936

3576663,2,B001FB55LW,"I love Jim Carrey - he's a rare talent - up there with Robin Williams in terms of wit, intelligence and acting capability - but that doesn't save ""Yes Man"" from being an awful film.

It must have seemed like a good idea as a screenplay at the time - he has to say 'yes' to everything - which will of course lead to all manner of hilarity. But mostly the jokes and sketches are wooden and fall flat on silence time after time after time. There's also a rather stupid and crude pun throughout about a certain regional accent. At times it seems like Hollywood just doesn't know what funny is anymore, except to be gross-out or crass or take the piss out of easy targets. My wife and daughter sat watching this with me - and asked several times how this dog got made - that's how bad it is...

The Blu Ray print is superb, but after a while that doesn't matter as you wished you'd hired something else.

Buy ""The Truman Show"" or ""Eternal Sunshine..."" or ""Lemony Snickett"" - Carey has done so much better than this.

One to avoid I'm afraid...",1243209600,2,1038,4.280612244897959

Luckily I was smart enough to wait for this one to come out on DVD, but still I had high hopes because most of Carrey'movies are pretty hilarious and the previews looked pretty funny.  WRONG!  This movie stinks I couldn't watch after about half-way through.  The gags aren't funny, the plot is typical and the characters are not likeable.  Particularly, I thought his boss character was really stupid and unfunny.  I liken this movie to 40 Year-Old Virgin which I also thought was terrible and I turned off half-way through, not funny.  I am truly shocked there are people who actually gave this good reviews (though it is clear many think as I do - don't even waste your time on this movie).",1242691200,8,835,4.594594594594595

It was surprisingly good yet not really annoying like I thought it could be. It also didn't hurt that Zooey Deschanel was in it, she can really do no wrong in my mind (well besides The Happening er) and also Rhys Darby from Flight of the Concords!

And this is going to sound weird and probably make no sense, but it was kind of like Slumdog Millionaire in the sense that everything was connected and I liked that. In this case it was a funny thing but it still worked really well.

I also thinks the concept of saying YES to everything can give us something to think about. I'm sure a lot of us, me especially included could take more chances, be more open minded, and say YES more often!

Overall a hilarious but not over the top movie with a interesting concept!",1242518400,,930,4.213483146067416
3576668,3,B001FB55LW,"Essentially a cock-eyed variation on ""Liar Liar,"" ""Yes Man"" presents Jim Carrey as a bank loan officer who spends most of his off-duty hours actively avoiding social engagements with his friends and co-workers.  A ""lonely guy"" by choice, Carl undergoes a life-altering experience when he attends a self-help seminar dedicated to the proposition that one can get a whole lot more out of life by saying ""yes"" when opportunity comes a-knockin' than by saying ""no.""  Soon, Carl is agreeing to virtually every offer that comes his way, often to surprising and hilarious results.

As a generally generic Carrey vehicle, ""Yes Man"" doesn't provide much in the way of a thespian stretch for the actor, who could toss one of these roles off in his sleep if he wanted to.  On the positive side, the movie feels less contrived than some of his previous efforts, thanks to the fact that it doesn't rely on some cheap gimmick like a magic spell or a knock on the head to get the plot rolling.  The decision to become compulsively agreeable remains an act of volition on the part of the character, thus making the tale more relatable and grounded in the long run.  Nobody is better than Carrey when it comes to over-the-top mugging and he is frequently in prime form here.  Moreover, there are quite a few genuine belly laughs that are alone worth the price of admission (with a randy encounter between Carl and his aged landlady achieving the movie's high point of hilarity).

On the downside, ""Yes Man"" does have a whiff of dj vu about it that it is never entirely able to shake.  Moreover, there is a certain threadbare quality that is almost inevitable when a movie's premise is built, as this one is, on the repetition of a single note.  And there are some definite dull patches when the comic ideas seem to be withering on the vine.  The compensation, beyond Carrey of course, comes in the form of two noteworthy supporting players: the likable Bradley Cooper as Carl's best buddy, and the winsome and charming Zooey Deschanel as the slightly offbeat motorcycle-riding band singer Carl meets and falls in love with during the course of the story.",1241568000,,2137,4.7331536388140165
3576669,3,B001FB55LW,"Carl Allen (Carrey), a divorced, borderline reclusive couch potato says, ""No"" to everything.  His negativity naturally steered him towards the divorce, his general malaise, and his work as a loan manager.  When his friend Nick (John Michael Higgins) convinces him to attend a cult-like `Yes' seminar from Terrence Bundley (Terence Stamp), his life soon changes.

Following the yes-mantra in every way, Carl soon meets Allison (Zooey Deschanel), who allows spontaneity and bizarre creativity to rule her life.  She is think outside the box personified, and, more importantly, different than the pre-vow Carl in every way.  Together they attack life and cross off a checklist that looks stolen from an insane person's bucket list.  Along the way, Carl predictably learns that in order to truly enjoy life, and another person, one must be open to new experiences and take life as it comes.  This is right up my philosophical alley, challenging oneself, breaking through barriers, and being able to look back in your later years with admiration.  The result is silly, typical Jim Carrey, with just enough laughs to make it enjoyable.  I especially enjoyed the name of the alternative band led by Allison: Munchausen by Proxy.  That's hilarious.  However, there are two major problems with this movie.

First, and not as significant, the cross-generational implied sex scene between Carl and his geriatric neighbor is enough to make a billygoat puke.  It's unnecessarily gross, and I've been less appalled by the Saw series.  Secondly, however, is the nave nature with which Carl embraces the ""say yes to everything""-culture.  After giving a bum a ride and allowing him to run down his cell battery, Carl drops the guy off in a dark, remote park and gives him a wad of cash.  Murders start out this way.  Imagine if he had said yes to other situations that could have been presented:

-Seriously, do you want to go in that meth house?
-Don't worry about protection; let's go au natural.  OK?
-Can I tell you what it is after you eat it?
-I know that hitchhiker has a bloody shirt and an ear-necklace, but I feel good about him because his sign says he's a vet.  Want to pick him up?

There's promise to the premise, but just like everything in life, there are shades of gray.

Overall, Carrey is pretty funny, especially during the Nebraska football scene, but I feel like the co-stars stole the show.  Zooey Deschanel is cute, and off-beat enough to make the character believable.  Other than Maggie Gyllenhall, I can't think of another actress who could have believably pulled it off.  Stamp is convincing as the self-help guru Bundley - his brood is like a snake-swinging church.  Higgins is hilarious as a cross between an insane man and a liberated free-thinker.  The true scene-stealer, however, is Rhys Darby as Norman; his costume parties (Harry Potter and 300) are hilarious, and his awkward Britishness (?) fits perfectly into the niche necessary for plot development.

Even though my single word feeling about this movie is, ""Meh,"" I happily say ""Yes"" and recommend it if for no other reason than to see Jim Carrey return to his comedic roots abandoned after Me, Myself, and Irene.",1241222400,,3187,4.928705440900563

I really enjoyed this movie and found a lot of what was going on to be very plausable. Now I've read a lot of reveiws about the sexual content and after watching it (which I found to be very funny) I found that they left most of it to the viewers imagination.

The launguage wasn't overdone, but it did fit into the certain dialogue, and the over all film was fairly well done.

Now I was reading one reviewers comments that said that the film was predictable. I'll agree with you on that point, but just seeing the outcome is often quite worth the wait.

I watched this movie with my 13-yr-old and 16-yr-old and was totally embarrassed during the scene with Carl's neighbor, Tilly.  My son fast forwarded it to the next scene.
Some parents may not care.  Some may not have the time to check.  But I think it's totally unnecessary to include that kind of sexual practice in a PG-13 movie.  Either it shouldn't be allowed or a new rating should be developed.  There are hundreds of impressionable middle school students who watch these kinds of movies and think it's ok to behave in that way.  Seeing it on the big screen just promotes it.

Zooey Deschanel - how can you not fall in love with this girl? Get the soundtrack with her singing - Yes Man - the title track to the movie - very cool.

Carl (banker) doesn't have much interest in life after he got broke up with his wife. He tries to avoid his friends; in the work he rejects all the loan applications. One day he met his old friend near his bank and he will inform Carl about the YES program that changed his life. Carl friend talks about throwing the stone in the glass wall to Carl. He says YES and broke the glass wall with the stone. As usual Carl didn't show any interest on the YES program but latter he decided to attend the seminar. Carl met his old friend in the seminar hall; people in the seminar hall and instructor will change him to say ""YES"" for all.

A poor man out side the seminar hall asks ride till park. He says YES and gave him a ride.

Poor guy asks Carl mobile to make call. He says YES and gave him mobile and he asks money; he gave all the money that he had. After he dropped the poor man in the park his car ran out fuel and stops. He takes the can with him and starts running towards Gas station to fill the fuel in the can. In the Gas station he gets a ride from a girl to park to refill the fuel. She is looks so pretty and naughty.

Carl says YES to all, learns Korean language, learns to drive flight, learns to play guitar, approves all loan and says YES to all activates arranged by his higher official in the office. Carl higher official got impressed with his approach. Mean time; he met that girl again. At one stage they fell in love. Carl was questioned by the security personals for suspicious activities.

Carrey is at his comedic best in this well paced and mostly hysterical romantic comedy. His relationship with Zooey Deschanel seems believable and the pair are very charming together. The film has some raunchy moments, but nothing that should offend most viewers.",1240099200,,527,4.728260869565218

This is a movie that Jim Carrey will want to forget quickly. It's almost sad watching one of Hollywood's most talented comedians turn into a pale shadow of his former self, trying to force some laughs out of this miserable script. The plot is obviously an attempt to replicate Liar Liar along the same lines but whereas Liar Liar was clever and funny, Yes Man is dumb and unfunny.

What started out promisingly enough, in the tradition of Liar Liar, soon petered out to be something more annoying than actually funny. Sometimes a good romantic comedy is a welcome deviation from the gloom and doom laden flicks that are the norm these days.

How about actually making one funny though instead of cute and sappy. Cute just isn't funny, just ask M. Mcconaghey (sp.), he wouldnt know funny if it hit him like a truck.

If you actually prefer real funny over just cute then stick with ""Fun with Dick and Jane"" or the raunchier ""Me, myself and Irene"".

The movie is well done, although predictable in some ways (it's a bit of a date movie some would say).  If you liked Liar Liar and/or Bruce Almighty, then I think you enjoy this movie.

Even if you only rent the movie, it is definately worth the money.

Hints of Liar, Liar are present but it's different enough to be clever and fresh on its own merit. I have really appreciated most of Carrey's movies, both the serious like The Truman Show and more slapstick like Fun with Dick and Jane, and think he's a good actor.

Zooey Deschanel is sarcastically charming as usual. I'm drawn to dry humor and she didn't disappoint in Yes Man.

But one thing bugged me to the point that I'm not going to watch it again, nor am I giving it a glowing recommendation. Same old, same old, rude sexual jokes and comments pepper the first half hour or so including an embarrassing [...] comment and a few references to genitals. A scene involving an elderly woman offering to pay for a neighborly gesture with sexual favors, and the follow-up scene with Carl (Carrey) on the bed and the dentures getting dropped into a glass of water. Then she targets another young man. All of these scenes and comments don't add to the plot line or humor. Oh, maybe an embarrassed titter, but really, the humor is junior high at best and it gets old.

We don't see the hero and heroine in bed. Carl turns away an opportunity with another woman. So I was left wondering about the whole point of Carl and his neighbor's little encounter.

I really wanted to respect Carl and his friends and root for him as he began to grow and change, but the distraction of the adolescent sexual humor really detracted from a story that could have been really good.",1239408000,,1595,4.547038327526132

The main character is essentially a rehash of the family friendly Carey from Liar Liar et al, but has a handful of adequately morally questionable moments to make the viewer wonder why he couldn't bring something a bit darker and different to bear.

The idea seemed kinda cheesy.
But this is an excellent feel-good movie with a message...
Start saying YES!

Who woulda thunk it?  Jim Carrey can actually still be funny.  This movie is very clever, original, and genuine.  Unlike most current comedies, it doesn't rely on foul language, sex & drug references, or sick, gross-out shocks for a cheap laugh.  It pushes some profound buttons and will make many people wonder...are you living life to the fullest?

Carrey plays a loan officer named Carl.  At work he's gotten into the habit of telling applicants ""No"".  Plus, due to the bad ending of a relationship, that negativity has rubbed off into all aspects of his life.
Until he's talked into attending a YES seminar.  Finally, he starts experiencing life.

Whether it's pulling an all-nighter at the bars, getting in a fight, learning to play guitar, or giving in to the elderly neighbor's sexual advances, it's quite an experience.  Good or bad, nothing is worse than wasting your life away.

YES MAN illustrates the importance of being spontaneous.  It is so easy in our daily lives to get stuck in the same routines.  It's actually sad to think about, pathetic really.  This movie has an undeniable energy without being too heavy-handed.  Highly recommended.",1239148800,,1302,4.958333333333333

Not that Peter (Bradley Cooper) and Rooney (Danny Masterson) let him drop out of life completely.  Carl works at a bank where he denies every loan that comes across his desk.

Things changes dramatically when he decides to attend a conference run by Terrence Bundley (Terrence Stamp).  Singled out of the crowd, Carl is put on the spot and agrees to a new contract with himself, to say ""Yes"" to everything that comes his way.

And almost immediately it begins working for him as he meets Allison (Zooey Deschanel).  The two begin a romance very quickly.  But can Carl continue his winning streak by saying ""Yes"" to everything?

This is the part where I condemn the movie with faint praise.

Billed as a comedy, there were several laugh out loud moments.  Emphasis on the several.  I was ready to laugh hard at the entire movie, and that just didn't happen.

On the whole, the movie is pretty predictable.  That was one reason I didn't find it as funny as I expected to.  I saw most of the jokes coming long before the punch line.  Likewise, all but a couple of the plot points were overly familiar.

On the other hand, I found the story enjoyable.  I identified with Carl a little too much, so I was rooting for him to get out of his rut and enjoy life again.  Heck, it even made me rethink how I am living my life.  Pretty head stuff from a comedy.  And the great acting from everyone in the cast made it easy to like the characters.

Since the movie is rated PG-13, I expected the language and sexual nature of some of the jokes.  But there were a couple in particular that I found out of line and squirm inducing.

So the problem with the movie really comes down to the writing.  I really do think there was promise in the premise for some genuine comedy, but it never developed into what it could have been.  This is a definite rent before you buy.",1239062400,7,2018,4.354838709677419

It is the funniest movie I seen since Four Christmases and White Chicks in 2004 (there have been a few others but I currently can't recall at the top of my head).

The funniest scene in the movie without spoiling the plot is where Jim Carrey's character runs from the hospital in his gown to see Zooey Daschael's character and almost gets himself killed riding his friend's out of this world heavy motorcycle (frankly it is a miracle he didn't get hit by another car or truck)! Another funny part of the movie was the part where Carrey's character clicks ""yes"" to the enlargement spam email on his work computer and later meets and Iranian woman. There are several other funny scenes throughout the movie with those two being my favorite.

This movie is definitely worth seeing at the theater (it is playing for $1.50 in the Blue-Ridge Cinemas in Raleigh) and with friends on DVD. You will be laughing every few minutes and chanting ""Yes, Yes, Yes"" for Carrey's character while you watch!",1234656000,2,1124,4.615
3576759,4,B001FB55LW,"I went to ""Yes Man"" with my 15 year old daughter just to pass the time, not expecting much based upon Jim Carrey's latest failures.  My daughter really enjoyed the movie and I was glad that I went.  The movie is predictable, but still very entertaining.  If you are a JC fan, then don't pass this one up.  I would highly recommend buying the soundtrack for the movie as well, it is very well done except for the glaring omission of the Journey song from the movie climax.  See the movie, buy the soundtrack, you will be pleased.",1232409600,10,528,4.346938775510204
3576760,4,B001FB55LW,"I went to this film dreading the worst, and came out yes, saying ""yes""
quite a bit more often. Bearing in mind the ""meaning"" of it, not saying
a monosyllable, and taking it all with a pinch of salt (like the
self-help guru Terrence Bundley teaches our man in the hospital), this
movie is fun, well made, and doesn't pretend deep meaningful questions.
Popcorn movie? Yes, but good one! Only once did I feel I was into
another formulaic trap. In my case, it was when Carl was riding the
super motorcycle. It felt like The Mirror Has Two Faces (Streisand's),
which was copied in (among others), ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"",
etc.

Moving to the stuff of life: I love Zooey Deschanel's Allison! Of
course, I don't know if I'd stand anything like her in real life, but
isn't she lovely as a woman living by her own rules, not wanting to be
stereotyped ""I've got fears, too!"" near the end, and yes, charmingly
out of tune with reality :)? I feel the part suits her perfectly.
Unlike another try of Carrey to play something sort of serious: Eternal
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's Kate Winslet, who's just crass, and
totally... uninviting :).

Bradley Cooper and his other sex addicted friend are fine, the scenes
with the old lady are a bit too much to, well, swallow, and

Rhys Darby is great. I didn't know the actor, but playing a perfect
goof takes guts! I felt pity for old Norman, which is good in such an
""optimistic"" film. Molly Sims is cool as a stupid gorgeous
materialistic woman. John Cothran Jr.'s voice is good for a boss. I am
having nightmares with it :). The joke on cops being paranoid about
yes, ""suspiciously chosen activities"" ""Who goes on holidays to Lincoln,
Nebraska"" :)? is fun, if a bit stereotyped Hollywood ""liberalism"" as
Americans like to misname it.

I agree with IDMB's reviewer bopdog from Cardiff, Wales about a) the
film being uplifting b) Carrey becoming ""a bit more human, and a bit
more approachable"". Morale? Go and enjoy uncritically (if you can)!",1231804800,3,1983,4.561797752808989

Never say Yes to everything because your life won't amount to a hill of beans if you do.  :)  Say yes to Jesus though!  Everything else is temporary.",1525910400,,356,4.161764705882353
