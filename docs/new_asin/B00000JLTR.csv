1234658,5,B00000JLTR,Until seeing this movie I thought the romantic comedy genre had little if not any potential.  I now realize that my opinions were based on the trite resumes of Nora Ephron and Meg Ryan.  This movie is light hearted with very enjoyable characters.  But if you're going to whine about the structure or some existenialist ideals I suggest you start attempting to build your own opinions rather than something that would impress your philosophy professor.,972432000,3,451,4.986666666666666
1234659,4,B00000JLTR,"Antoine Doinel, French director Franois Truffaut's cinematographic double, returns in STOLEN KISSES after an eight years break (if one excepts the short movie ANTOINE ET COLETTE ). Back to a beloved character for  Truffaut, back to the civilian life for Antoine - Jean-Pierre L&eacute;aud -  Doinel who tries to survive in the Paris of 1967.
STOLEN KISSES is not a  realistic movie, it's rather a mixture of light comedy and psychologic  melodrama. I could say that Antoine Doinel is the big brother of the  characters described 30 years later by Wes Anderson in BOTTLE ROCKET or  RUSHMORE.
STOLEN KISSES is also a movie about how Truffaut saw the  relations between men and women. According to this movie, they are more  than complex and this theme, from this moment on, will be one of the  constants of Franois Truffaut's next movies of the 70's and the 80's.
A  dozen Truffaut trailers as bonus features, filmographies and english  subtitles. Average sound but below-average images with faded colours.
A  DVD for the Doinel fans.",960854400,4,1032,4.970760233918129
1234660,3,B00000JLTR,"To me this film has nothing REALLY important to say. It doesn't take on any existenial issues or something,in short,it's just pure entertainment. And that's fine with me! I found this film is being truly amusing and very  enjoyable. Leaud is perfect in his role. Before you watch this film,keep in  mind it is not of the caliber of lets say ""400 blows"" or  ""Day for Night"". This is something to watch only if your in the  mood for something lighthearted. So sit back and enjoy.",958608000,7,477,4.511627906976744
1234661,2,B00000JLTR,"After reading the two reviews above, I bought Stolen Kisses sight-unseen. I wish I'd rented it first. It may have been a pivotal film 20 years ago in France, but it hardly holds up. There's very little structure--the story  meanders aimlessly from place to place. And I don't know what the reviewers  above found funny or sexy--there's not a lot of humor (certainly not by  today's comic standards), and there's no sex by any standards. Rent it  first, then decide if you need to own it.",946771200,8,487,4.627906976744186
7912622,5,B00000JLTR,"Stolen Kisses is a lyrical study on youthful love. To me, it ranks among Franois Truffaut's finest: The 400 Blows, Shoot the Piano Player and Jules & Jim. I'm glad you had it available at Amazon",1267660800,,194,4.416666666666667
7912623,2,B00000JLTR,"After being blown away by ""The 400 Blows"", I couldn't wait to continue the story of Truffaut's alter-ego, Antoine Doinel. So I have to report with some disappointment that I found this movie a less-than-worthy successor, lacking the tremendous narrative impetus of the first, and also lacking the charming performances and the cinematic virtuosity. It's not that it's totally terrible but it's not very good either.

We meet Doinel being discharged from the army. Back on the streets of Paris, he resumes a career as a jerk-of-all trades. He is successively, a hotel night desk clerk, a detective, a shoe shop stock room boy and a TV repairman. He fails at everything but has success in his on-off relationship with Christine for reasons that are not quite clear. He's also seduced by the wealthy wife of one of his bosses.

Jean-Pierre Leaud, so wonderful in ""The 400 Blows"", is not terribly compelling as an adult actor. His main tic is forever sweeping his greasy hair away from his eye. And Doinel is an unsympathetic character. He's not committed to anything. He doesn't seem to care what happens to him. When he's fired, he shrugs his shoulders. Whenever someone points him in a particular direction, he follows it -- until something else happens. I found it hard to square this aimless character with the unforgettable image of the intense kid who made a break for freedom at the end of ""The 400 Blows"" and kept running and running until he found it.
The plot meanders around but I found myself steadily losing interest. There are two more movies in the series but I won't bother watching them.",1251590400,5,1601,4.797101449275362
7912624,5,B00000JLTR,I wanted to see this film because I like a lot the beauty of the actress (Claude Jade) but I found a very good film,1228694400,,115,3.64
7912625,5,B00000JLTR,"Filmed during the 1968 riots in Paris, Franois Truffaut's endearing, souffl-light romantic comedy continues the saga of Antoine Doinel, played by a grown-up Jean-Pierre Leaud, who first appeared in the director's semi-autobiographical classic ""The 400 Blows."" As the boyishly inept Doinel, Leaud is effortlessly charming, while the radiant Seyrig is marvelous as a smoldering seductress married to a neurotic shoe salesman. Witty, touching, and studded with gorgeous views of the City of Lights, ""Stolen Kisses"" is one of Truffaut's sweeter confections.",1182988800,,553,5.839506172839506
7912626,4,B00000JLTR,"This is Truffaut's third movie in his ANTOINE ET COLLETTE series, which began brilliantly with THE 400 BLOWS. It begins with Antoine (Jean-Pierre Leaud) being dishonorably discharged from the army and eventually getting a job with a detective agency. He's not very good at it, though he tries hard, and on one case, while working as a stockboy in a shoe store, he has an affair with the owner's wife Fabienne, (played by Delphine Seyrig).

In addition to all this, Truffaut explores Antoine's relationship with long-time girlfriend Catherine (Catherine Lutz) - the ambiguities and confusions that go along with young love. The best scenes by far are those between Antoine and Fabienne - they are vibrant and compelling. Too much of the rest, though good, seems inconsistent. Antoine's character is maddening to watch and is perfectly played by Leaud: he can't quite grasp life around him, yet he can shrug it off as if lost in a fog he's unaware of. Truffaut has made better movies than this one, but it's not bad at all. Worth a watch.",1130803200,,1036,4.820224719101123
7912627,5,B00000JLTR,"This is a delightful Truffaut movie starring Jean-Pierre Leaud who played Antoine Doinel, the running boy in Truffaut's famous Les Quatre cents coup (1959).  He's a young man now just discharged from the army bouncing from one temporary job to another, from being a night watchman to being a TV repairman.  He gets into scrapes and gets fired, but presses on (in-between impulsive liaisons with ladies of the evening).
He gets his big chance when he lucks into a job with a private detective agency.  After some mishaps he is called upon to take a job (within a job, as it were) at a shoe store to find out why the owner is not liked.  There he meets the owner's wife, Fabienne Tabard, played by Delphine Seyrig (Last Year at Marienbad 1961; The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie 1972, etc.).  He is  immediately smitten by her.  In typical French cinematic fashion it is not clear whether she is a goddess or a maternal figure for the thoroughly bewitched Antoine.
Meanwhile there is Christine Darbon (Claude Jade) who plays Antoine's real love interest.  What makes this film so thoroughly agreeable is Truffaut's light-hearted wit and his studious avoidance of cliche in a genre (the romantic comedy) in which cliches abound.  The humor is often tongue-in-cheek, and as subtle as a diplomat's compliment.  Leaud's charm and his oh so earnest style make him the perfect foil for life's little jokes.  Along the way detective agencies are satirized as are its clientele, including a guy who wants his magician boyfriend tailed only to find that he is--horrors!--married, or the aforementioned shoe haberdasher who hires a private eye (not a shrink!) to find out why he is not beloved.
Bottom line: see this for Francois Truffaut, whose keen sense of humanity's foibles and unique style, sometimes playful and sometimes penetrating, have made him one of cinema's greatest directors.",1085875200,4,1882,4.961783439490445
7912628,1,B00000JLTR,"The 400 Blows is deservedly one of the best movies of all time. Stolen Kisses, a continuation of the Antoine Doinel character, could possibly qualify as one of the worst (okay, a bit of an exaggeration, but it is bad). Truffaut obviously decided to go for a farcical Antoine, which proved to be a big, big mistake. Antoine is no longer that edgy, rebellious character struggling with the constraints imposed by authority.  Remember how he reacted when he got slapped in the face?  Very little reaction, which was perfect and believable.  In Kisses, you have an Antoine who is more fawning than stoic, more mimicking than reserved. The result is this viewer's disappointment.  In addition, the plot is haphazard, breezy, and meaningless.  The ending is forgettable, in complete contrast to that of The 400 Blows.  Do yourself a favor: instead of wasting your time watching this, watch The 400 Blows again.",1072483200,2,904,4.953642384105961
7912629,5,B00000JLTR,"""Stolen Kisses"" is also one of those films that I can watch over and over again without getting bored.  This film is charming and funny. Jean-Pierre Leaud's exaggerated expressions (his ""declaration of love"" for Madame Tabat scene and the ""Chiquitita banana"" scene) certainly contribute to the film's charm.  I adore the characters Antoine and Christine very much.  The film is very well made; like all Truffaut's films, the music, sceneries, casts, lighting, landscapes, angles etc all fit in like a perfect jigsaw puzzle.  I feel that the best scene is the beginning of the movie where Truffaut shoot scenes of moving cars on the street and then slowly moves on to shoot the entrance of a cinema.  It is also then the music fills in the background. I agree with one of the reviewers that this film makes good use of Charles Trenet's song ""Que Reste-T-Il De Nos Amours"".  Simply delightful!",1051574400,3,891,4.867549668874172
7912630,4,B00000JLTR,"Third adventure of DOINEL,TRUFFAUT's semi-autobiographical character after THE FOUR HUNDRED BLOWS and ANTOINE AND COLETTE(not a full film).ANTOINE now a young man discovers love in the presence of a mature woman(DELPHINE SEYRIG)and then with a girl of his age(CLAUDE JADE).Not one of the director's best movie,it contains nevertheless many priceless moments like the scene that has ANTOINE testing his image in a mirror and saying the name FABIENNE TABARD(mesure your degree of tolerance with that scene)The film makes good use of CHARLES TRENET's song QUE RESTE-T-IL DE NOS AMOURS?The charms of many vignettes actually surpasses the coherence of the whole. Fans of the director have head start here.",1034726400,,700,5.4907407407407405
7912631,5,B00000JLTR,"One could argue most effectively that STOLEN KISSES is Truffaut's best film, he's working at the height of his powers here.  Of the Truffaunt canon, only DAY FOR NIGHT can be seen as better.  Truffaut's masterful direction of a misguided, loveable ne'er-do-well is uncanny and refreshing to this day.  Truffaut's treatment of unrecoited love dwarves most modern attempts at the subject by its sheer believability.  Unlike most films on the subject where the tired, cliched tortured hero can barely cope, Doniel (troubled nonetheless) handles it in a honest and realistic manner.
The film, like life, has many touching moments, questing moments and frustrating moments; it oscilates from drama to comedy so easily, so much like life itself - something rare in American film in particular.
Truffaut masterly uses the camera to capture the right image at the right moment, the right time for the right effect.  It's hard to believe his star has diminished as much as it has in the near two decades since his untimely death.",972950400,,1020,5.0476190476190474
