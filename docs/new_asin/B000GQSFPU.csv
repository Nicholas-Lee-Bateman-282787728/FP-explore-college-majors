Kenneth  More is a very talented actor , sometimes a trifle too serious
but always convincing. A wonderful device, this entire story and all the actors
are played well. The DVD quality is suprisingly good after so many years",1349222400,,281,4.62
2615934,5,B000GQSFPU,"I saw The Admirable Crichton in London as a teen, then again last year at the Shaw Festival in Niagara On The Lake. In between. I'd tried to get my hands on a copy of the film adaptation. It was worth the wait. The film is a good adaptation of the JM Barrie play - it still has its humor, bite, and romance firmly in tact. Kenneth More is - as usual - excellent, as is the budding Sally Ann Howes. The only pity is issuing it under the name Paradise Lagoon rather than The Admirable Crichton.",1341792000,,492,4.082474226804123
2615935,5,B000GQSFPU,"A grand movie.

It's a type of movie that hollywood has forgotten the formula too.
It's a much better movie than the PAL version--quality-wise and format-wise.
The PAL version has a lot of defects that constantly show up and it's much more grainy;
plus its aspect ration is 4:3.
It was definitely not cleaned.

This newly available version (a print on demand version with the purple Blu-ray disc)is of higher
quality and it's aspect ratio is 1.85:1 based on the fact that in covers the entire screen--it was a very
pleasant surprise.  So, avoid the PAL version unless you prefer an aspect ration of 4:3 and a lower quality version of the film and you have a region free DVD player.

Although Amazon has it listed as ""The Admirable Crichton,"" as you can see this version has the title of ""Paradise Lagoon"" denoting that it's the American version. Nevertheless, either title can be used to find this wonderful film.

There's no menu, no extras and no selecting of scenes and when the movie ends, it just starts playing all over again.
But, it doesn't matter.  It's got good quality and the wide-screen format--and besides you really don't need the other extras--remember VHS?

It's a great family flick--and it makes you wonder if you're really free in today's world.",1327536000,11,1265,4.775229357798165
2615936,5,B000GQSFPU,This is a great movie. It is a study on how different circumstances can suddenly change a person's status in society. I saw it once long ago on TV and have been waiting almost as long for them to come out with the DVD in US format.,1300406400,4,231,3.9361702127659575
2615937,4,B000GQSFPU,"J.M. Barrie's delightful comedy THE ADMIRABLE CRICHTON (aka ""Paradise Lagoon"", 1957) paints a vivid picture of the class divide of ""Master-Servant"" in England, and shakes up those notions when one such household becomes shipwrecked on a desert island where survival relies not on priviledge, but on resourcefulness.

Lord Loam (Cecil Parker), his three daughters, their faithful butler Crichton (Kenneth More) and sparky ""tweeny-maid"" Eliza (Diane Cilento) survive an explosion aboard Loam's steam yacht, and wash up on the shore of an island somewhere in the South Seas.  Naively thinking that they can continue their traditional household roles, Loam and his family blithely go about their days in the usual pattern.  Feeling unappreciated and underfoot, Crichton takes a stand and Eliza follows; clearly there has to be another way to live on the island, with equal opportunity for all.  Two years go by, enough time for the structures of the Loam household to be taken apart.  But what will happen to Crichton's blooming romance with Loam's lovely daughter Lady Mary (Sally Ann Howes) when the inevitible rescue ship finally arrives?

Set against the backdrop of Edwardian-era London, with all of the political upheavel, suffragettes and technical advances that came in that stormy period, THE ADMIRABLE CRICHTON has a lot to say about the British class-system.  Kenneth More is outstanding in the title role; encapsulating the ""teddibly"" proper Gentleman's Gentleman; yet he's also incredibly athletic and heroic in the island scenes.  I don't think Kenneth More gets enough credit for his prowess as a first-rate romantic leading man.

Sally Ann Howes glows as Lady Mary.  This was one of her final acting roles in England before bursting onto Broadway, where she replaced Julie Andrews in ""My Fair Lady"".  You can see the beginnings of her signature Truly Scrumptious in CRICHTON; all at once she's frosty, fiery, earthy, and ethereal.  Truly (no pun intended) this is one of her finer screen performances.  Diane Cilento is delightful as the cockney maid who becomes quite emancipated once she reaches the island.  Martita Hunt co-stars, doing her best ""Lady Bracknell"" turn as the mother of Lady Mary's not-so-grief-stricken fianc back in England.

THE ADMIRABLE CRICHTON is still quite hard to locate on video in the States.  If you have a region-free setup, it's available on DVD from the United Kingdom, however the print used comes from the old fullscreen video master (complete with the alternate ""Paradise Lagoon"" titles).

Kenneth More is perfect in the role of Gov and you'll find yourself wishing the movie and their situation will last a little longer.

2615953,3,B000GQSFPU,"PARADISE ISLAND (UK title THE ADMIRABLE CRICHTON) is a Technicolor version of the old Barrie classic.  Filmed by Rank at the height of its studio period, it stars Kenneth More in the eponymous role as the butler who manages to adapt to life on a desert island.  More isn't the most obvious personality to play a butler - his breezy screen persona projected a more louche image than that expected of a gentleman in service - but he makes a good stab at the role.  He is complemented in the film by Cecil Parker as his employer.  A much underrated actor, Parker was extremely good at playing harassed males of a certain vintage - outwardly authoritative yet inwardly insecure.  In this production it's clear that he cannot manage without Crichton.  Director Lewis Gilbert handles familiar material with lan, making this a satisfying piece of entertainment.",1372896000,,854,4.855172413793103
2615954,4,B000GQSFPU,"This amusing and poignant film demonstrates how the upper classes sometimes lack the basic skills and imagination for survival under duress. The butler, who actually supports class separation, is the most competent person around. The family learns to survive on an island because of his brilliance. He becomes their master, yet he succumbs to the old ways. A terrific film for watching with your children, to teach them self reliance, and the absurdity of class distinctions.

My memories were of a much more adventurous tale.  It was a nice, nostalgic evening when I watched the DVD but overall the story lacks punch today.  I decided that Sherwood Schwartz must have been watching when he dreamed up the very similar Gilligan's Island.  With Downton Abbey all the rage some screenwriter should look at the JM Barrie play and leverage the story of class distinctions with a new twist, take it up a notch.",1364860800,,561,4.41747572815534

2615958,4,B000GQSFPU,"I grew up in England, where this film was called ""The Admirable Crichton"" after the JM Barrie play on which it's based.  ""Paradise Lagoon"" is such a boring and misleading title for a story that's about the British class system in Edwardian times.

Be that as it may, as I get older I often find the treasures of my youth have faded, but not this film.  I have been trying to find a copy of this film for many years and I was not disappointed.  The only thing that has changed is my appreciation of the ending, which is much better now than when I was 18; Crichton had to marry the Tweenie and not the aristocrat, despite the passion - marriage is more than just that.  At 66 you know that much better.

As to the movie making - I had expected the production values would have faded, but no!  This is a fine film at all levels.",1356998400,,826,4.1572327044025155

I am now 73 years old, and when I watched it, I loved it all over again.  No, it is no longer my favorite movie.  But from my vantage of 73 years, I can understand why I liked it so much.  For me, it was the challenge of prevailing against adversity.  To live a decent and noble life, despite privation.  The movie teaches that no matter who you are, or where you are, you can prevail against adversity.  A good man can find a good woman, no matter what the circumstances.  It is a lesson for the ages.

Unfortunately, England intervened, and Chriton reverted to his previously-accustomed lowly status.  Whereas it was a sad ending,  it was a suitable ending.
I suggest that you buy the movie and watch it.  It will influence you much less that it influenced me.  No matter.  If it affects you just one percent of how it affected me, you can expect that you life will change.  Not by much, but by a little bit.",1436745600,4,1042,4.293814432989691
8133918,5,B000GQSFPU,"I always loved this film and recently I was delighted to see that albeit made 58 years ago, it didn't age one little bit. Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.

Year of Grace 1905. William Crichton (Kenneth More) is the highly efficient butler in the London household of the Earl of Loam (Cecil Parker) and his family. The Earl considers himself a progressive and is against class divisions  Crichton on another hand is extremely class-conscious and conservative (in fact ultra-reactionary). The Earl has three grown up daughters and the oldest, Mary (Sally Ann Howes), is an incredible beauty  and as she is very conscious of this fact, the magnitude of her pride (arrogance) matches her looks. Soon after the film begins the Earl takes his family on a trip around the world on his yacht, but once they arrive to the South Seas the voyage is interrupted That will lead to quite a lot of interesting developments, which will also affect the class stratification  but for the sake of those who somehow managed to not know this story I will not say more.

Written by J.M. Barrie in 1902 the theatre piece ""Admirable Crichton"" was an immediate and ENORMOUS success and by making the author largely known, it certainly helped a lot his next major opus, ""Peter Pan"", which became an even bigger sensation two years later. This film is a very faithful adaptation of the piece and is mostly based on splendid, witty dialogs.

The casting is simply perfect and all actors did an amazing job. Kenneth More, who already completely stunned me by his incredible portrayal of Sir Douglas Bader in ""Reach for the Sky"", plays here probably the second role of his life  he is simply PERFECT as Crichton. Veteran actor Cecil Parker is also great as Earl of Loam. Australian actress Diane Cilento, a girl with stunning legs who was going later to marry Sean Connery, plays marvellously the humble bumbling maid ""Tweeny"", a very endearing character. Another veteran of cinema and theatre, Martita Hunt, plays admirably Lady Brocklehurst  this last character is in fact a formidable female dragon rather than a woman

This film however would not be as good as it is without Sally Ann Howes, who belonged to the small minority of women so beautiful, that it actually hurts the eyes when you try to look at them  and she also surely knew how to play. Her character in this film, Mary, allowed her to show her talent in such a way that she is even hotter than her looks. This incredibly proud princess, who later becomes well, another kind of proud princess, is the kind of woman for the possession of whom it is worth to fight to the last drop of blood. Conquering such a princess must feel like ravishing Artemis  and it would probably be worth it even if one had to be then savaged by his own bloodhounds... As for the loss of such a woman, well, the grief and pain must be indescribable and insufferable... Without this character and Sally Ann Howes to play her, this film wouldn't be as good as it is.

This being a work of fiction, author had to take some liberties with reality, beginning with the portrayal of high born British people as hapless in difficult circumstances. I don't really have the impression that such was really a case. British nobility, women and senior gentlemen very much included, proved to have real spine and darn tough hide in many a tough scrape, as well in colonial and overseas fighting (Indian Mutiny and Boxer Rebellion come immediately to mind) as during the terrible years of World War II. Young gentlemen were also quite roughly educated and treated in elite schools and me for one I somehow don't really see Stalky, MTurk or even bookish Beetle, once fully grown, being totally clueless in the wilderness... But this is a very minor point and of course without licentia poetica we would have no good stories at all.

As already mentioned earlier the success of this film resides mostly in the incredibly witty dialogs, in fact a permanent verbal fencing between all the characters, but there are also other elements, which make it into something much, much more than just a hilarious comedy about poorly assorted people thrown together into an unusual situation. ""Admirable Crichton"" contains also some serious elements, which make it into a bittersweet treat  and in the process transforms it into something more than just harmless entertainment.

Both the piece and the film contain a reflexion on class divisions which is much deeper than one could expect from a comedy and it gives to the whole story a more serious, darker and sad element. The author was of course himself member of nobility and therefore his views were probably somehow biased, but I rather agree with his conclusion that classless society is not possible  sooner or later, even if you try to erase the differences by violence, some animals will always become more equal than others...

Admirable Crichton contains also many elements which J.M. Barrie continued to explore and developed later in Peter Pan. In both stories we have a group of characters who escape from the reality of life to spend a magic moment in an enchanted distant land, who remake there their life from scratch, live wonderful adventures and find happiness  but who cannot stay there indefinitely, because the real life calls them back. This return is painful and causes many tears to flow but it is nevertheless a good thing, because if the real world is a tough, even cruel place, it still has the advantage of being real... WARNING! WARNING! SOME SPOILERS AHEAD! This is why in both stories Wendy has to go her own way and the main hero must go back to Tinker Bell, the one girl who always faithfully loved him...

Bottom line, this is an EXCELLENT film, an absolutely marvellous classic of humour, serious reflexion and romance, with an amazing performance by Kenneth More and one incredibly beautiful actress portraying an impressively proud and fierce princess. TO SEE ABSOLUTELY! ENJOY!",1435017600,,5979,4.804284323271665
