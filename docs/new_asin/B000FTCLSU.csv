2585316,5,B000FTCLSU,"The Wire is the best show in TV, I been watching it since season 1 and each season gets better and better. I'm glad HBO is finally bringing season 3 to DVD. I have the 1st 2 on DVD and can't wait to add this to my collection. To fully appreciate season 3 you should watch the 1st 2 seasons or you will be missing a lot of the story and why certain things are happening. Season 3 focuses back on Avon Barksdale who is released from prison and Stringer Bell his lieutant who was holding it down while he was locked up. Omar is still out to get Stringer and Avon for what they did to his boyfriend Brandon in season 1 and all have to say is you have to watch season 3, the end of the show will truly shock you. Great acting by all the actors, great story can wait for season 4. The Wire is the reason I have HBO.",1153872000,8,809,3.909090909090909
2585317,5,B000FTCLSU,"It seems like the best shows take forever to come to DVD. The Wire is the best show HBO has ever done and I know that's a big deal. I say this because no other show has such a depth in character. Every character has a certain duality and I mean every charater. I'll admit that I'm the type who likes to cheer for the bad guys and the problen with most TV shows within the crime genere is that they favor the good guys too much and it gets boring. On the Wire the line between good and bad isn't all that clear to begin with because at some point everybody is human. Most shows are black and white with a small grey area but the Wire has chosen to function entirely in the grey area and that's what makes it so good.
Of course I have my favorite characters but honestly I love them all. The ones that really stand put to me are ""Stringer Bell, because he's so smooth...even when he's slippin'"" ""Brother Mouzone, the Nation of Islam hitman who might just be the scariest dude on the show"" and McNaulty which surprises me because normally a crusading good guy character like him will eventually wear thin, but you can't help but like the guy.
Those charaters are some of my favorites but like I said every character in the show gives you a reason to feel somthing for them.
Season three doesn't miss and I suggest you get the first two seasons before you watch this one. The Wire is like a good series of books so start at the beginning and work you way to season 3",1150761600,8,1462,4.1879432624113475
2585318,5,B000FTCLSU,"The Wire gets better with each season.  Without a doubt, it is the best show on TV.

Season 3 has it all: great writing, great acting, and the best story of the entire series. If you love the Wire, you must get this.",1149206400,15,216,4.0
2585319,5,B000FTCLSU,"HBO have at long last, decided to release this on DVD and thank goodness. The Wire is undoubtedly the best TV around these days since ""Homicide: Life on the Street"". No surprise then, I guess that the same man (David Simon) had/has a big hand in both series.

Unlike most crime/cop shows that have a beginning, middle and end in the one episode, the story here is spread over the entire series. We're seeing stuff that kicked off in Season 1 still developing in Season 3. Some viewers find this challenging - this certainly isn't a show you can watch while cooking dinner or chatting to your buddies on the phone. It's sad that ratings have dropped though because if you give the show the undivided attention it deserves and focus on the story, complex as it is, the rewards are truly immense.

After the drama on the docks that was the main focus of Season 2, Season 3 takes it back to the streets where we most like it. The Baltimore drug wars rage on, with Avon Barksdale, played by Wood Harris, out of jail to find his territory of corners under threat from young & ruthless upstart, Marlo, played utterly convincingly by Jamie Hector. Stringer Bell has held things down while Avon's been away but his methods have been questionable, to put things mildly. Stringer gets his comeuppance this season though and as much as I hated the character - and admired Idris Elba for playing it so well - I honestly didn't see his comeuppance coming in the way it eventually did. Scorching scriptwriting!

The police are desperately trying to keep up. Major ""Bunny"" Colvin, played by Robert Wisdom, comes up with the 'brilliant' idea of creating a 'safe zone' for drug sale and use in the city and this area gets dubbed Amsterdam. The plan seems to work - the rest of the city suddenly becomes a haven - but Colvin keeps the project from his superiors. The results are disastrous, for him and for the city.

Meanwhile, the detail is back on the hunt and as we watch them chase their tails, the questions left hanging in the air are what is this so-called war on drugs about, exactly? And who is winning?

In the background, meanwhile, there's scheming, wrangling and backstabbing in the corridors of the city political powers. Unlike the stuff on ""The West Wing"" this is the kind of politics I can get into and this is a story that is going to run and run.

Like any TV show, this one has its 'stars' but this is truly an ensemble performance. Everyone, whether it's by playing a starring role, a recurring role, bit part or even an extra, gets to contribute a crucial part of the jigsaw that makes up the big picture.

Still, I must mention some of my favourite performers. Apart from those already mentioned, they include: Lance Reddick, an actor with the ability to convey more with a single look than most actors can with a whole minute of dialogue, as Lieutenant Daniels; Dominick West, who plays Detective Jimmy McNutly, a cop who races to save the world while his own life crumbles around him; Sonja Sohn, who plays Detective Kima Greggs, McNulty's loyal partner, who realises she's not as ready for a life of domesticity with her girlfriend and their baby as she had originally thought; Andre Royo, who plays Bubbles the 'co-operative' drug fiend with heart; Michael K. Williams, who plays Omar the gay gangster with a shotgun - something I never thought I'd see on TV in my lifetime; Frankie Faison and John Doman who play Commissioner Burrell and Deputy Commissioner Rawls respectively (for some reason, neither fails to make me laugh out loud with every line they deliver); Michael Hyatt, who plays Brianna Barksdale, mother of D'Angelo (who was murdered in Season 2) and sister to kingpin Avon; and last but by no means least, the 'dynamic' duo Detectives Herc and Carver, played wonderfully by Dominick Lombardozzi and (the beautiful) Seth Gilliam respectively.

And then there's Chad L. Coleman as Dennis ""Cutty"" Wise, the ex-con who finds he no longer has the stomach for the streets. He turns to volunteering, running a youth boxing gym. Here's an actor to look out for and he brings an intensity to his role that I found mesmerising. I hope we get to see more of him in future Seasons.

This is a totally believable drama with cracking dialogue and nary a cliche or stereotype to be seen. The reactions to the show, both positive and negative just go to show how a gritty and realistic drama series can hit home.

This is a must for any connoisseur of mature and thought provoking TV. This is one show that takes a long, unapologetic and uncompromising look at an underclass we would all prefer to ignore and thus, while it's not always pretty, it is always riveting. If you don't have seasons 1 & 2, I recommend you get them now. This one of very few shows I am able to watch over and over and not get bored, learning and appreciating something new each time. I am placing my pre-order for Season 3 forthwith!",1149206400,145,4918,4.603881278538813
2585320,5,B000FTCLSU,"I watched Seasons 1 & 2 again last week and came to the realization that it was the best show on HBO. I used to have Sopranos in my top spot, but the Wire has passed it. It has the patience and intelligence I wish the Sopranos could consistently maintain. However, the Wire has only had three seasons and the Sopranos six, so it is might be harder for Chase and crew.

Season Three picks up where Season 2 left off with Daniel's new team investigating the dope in Baltimore. Like the two previous seasons having a theme (1-streets & police, and 2-dock workers and smuggling) this season involves the politics.

Season 2 is still my favorite, but all three seasons are amazing. The third continues the standards of the previous two seasons with excellent writing, acting, and pacing. Robert Wisdom who potrays Major Colvin and Aidan Gillen who plays Councilman Thomas 'Tommy' J. Carcetti  are excellent new additions who hold their own to an exellent ensemble.

Thank you HBO for making a 4th Season, despite lower ratings. The critics are right, this is the best drama on TV.",1148947200,35,1075,4.671957671957672
2585321,5,B000FTCLSU,"The Wire is a gritty and gripping detective drama, which is widely considered to be one of the all-time best shows in this genre, as well as being one of the greatest television programs ever made. It was created and primarily written by David Simon, the renowned author and former crime reporter, who, because of his background, was able to impart an uncanny sense of realism to the series. The Wire was set and produced in Baltimore, Maryland, and its story line centers around the organization and function of the criminal drug trade in Baltimore, and the tragic way in which it has ravaged the city, and its beleaguered residents. The Wire consists of a total of sixty episodes, spanning five seasons, with a different emphasis for each season. Although the multifaceted drug trade represents the overarching focus of this series, each individual season assesses the manner in which this criminal enterprise impacts a specific operational area of the city of Baltimore. The first season of The Wire examines the drug trade itself, the second season deals with the dysfunctional seaport system, the third season analyzes the corrupt city government and bureaucracy, the fourth season addresses the deteriorating school system, and the fifth and final season evaluates the unethical print news media. It brutally and realistically depicts the devastating effects that the criminal narcotic trade has had on the residents of inner city Baltimore, whose lives have been destroyed by the pervasive drug-related misery, despair, and hopelessness, which have now become endemic in this population. The Wire is characterized by insightful and brilliant writing, superb plot and character development, and absolutely spectacular acting performances, by its exceedingly talented ensemble cast. It definitely deserves the numerous awards and accolades which it has received over its five-year run. The Wire is a truly outstanding television series, which is riveting, moving, and emotional, and it merits an unequivocal five-star rating, along with a very strong recommendation.",1499126400,2,2071,5.414860681114551

The development of characters using such a talented cast is really something to behold. I still have a sense of who those people were, as if they were real. In fact, the storytelling was phenomenal but the gem can be found in peeling back the layers and identifying with a character you'd never tried to understand before.",1484092800,,462,4.511904761904762

Now that I've had the chance to watch all of it I have to say that this is and will always be the best show in HBO's history bar none. I say that being a fan of GOT, Westworld, and watching shows such as Deadwood, Oz as well as Entourage. It's 5 seasons and yet I watch them with such ease and enjoyment that I can't believe I'm on season 4. I've been slowing up trying to not watch it daily and yet I'm almost done.

2585512,5,B000FTCLSU,"THE WIRE is STILL one of the best HBO series ever made, and that's saying something, since HBO has produced so much good TV. What is remarkable  is the depth and breadth of the series. At the center is a small group of cops concentrated on drug gangs in Baltimore. As the series goes on you see gang members as human beings, corruption leading into the city and state governments, unions, and even the department of justice. You also see the venality of police enmeshed in politcs. Senior cops trying to show good statistics for their command as the city continues to deteriorate. And yes, there are plenty of characters to like. Men and women trying to do their work with integrity against the odds. If you've never seen it, watch it. If it's been a long time, watch it again.",1483315200,2,777,4.51063829787234

2585590,4,B000FTCLSU,A show that continues to be methodical in its highly specific exploration of how different bureaucratic structures work.

I do get tired of the language but realism is part of the appeal of this series. Although a softer side and some humor appear occasionally, this is not a series that would ever be contemplated by Disney. As time has moved on the ""wow"" factor of the technology has faded, and in the not too distant future, younger viewers may be downright confused; however, i'd bet they will still find it a captivating story.",1481241600,,559,4.427184466019417

Obvious  are the writers points that seem to be made. The awareness of the political connection and interaction with the crime world is interesting. The insight in the law enforcement life was interesting when revealing their challenges in racial, diverse characters, personal lives and their frustrations in doing their duties. Urban life in the raw...nothing much here that our youth can obtain from the positive interactions. But it was not geared to them but for the Mature audience. I plan on finishing the series.

The ongoing Jimmy McNulty, Bunk, Kima stories continue with quite a few shifts as the impressive Bunny suffers difficulties, Prez endures a true shocker and the second to last show of the season develops out a character in such a shocking way that I can't say anything about it here without being a plot wrecker. But suffice it say, I was really disappointed in that I had no idea how much the character had meant to me over the season. Anyway, hard to discuss without giving it all away, but the typically entertwined series of side plots done so skillfully, make for great viewing and the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5, is that there were a couple of cliches that didn't need to be.",1478649600,,793,4.475862068965517

2585692,5,B000FTCLSU,"I feel like the third season of The Wire is one of the most compelling seasons of television I've seen.  In my opinion, the most interesting plotlines, among many, are Bunny Colvin's ""free zone"", the fight between Marlo and the Barksdale crew after Avon's return and Cutty's attempt to rehabilitate himself and the corner kids through the boxing gym.  I'm not terribly interested in the political thread, but when the interplay between the Barksdale crew and the political institutions goes south, it makes for great TV.",1478390400,,520,5.034883720930233

2585885,5,B000FTCLSU,"This series just gets better with each season.  Although the technology has changed tremendously since the show was filmed, the culture, corruption, political gamesmanship and racial tension are just as relevant now as then.  Season 3 looks like it could have been intended as the show finale as so  many storylines come to a violent but satisfying close. Dialogue reads like a poetry slam.

Don't really like the ethnic homey stuff either, BUT...I got hooked on all of the seasons of this show. I even felt sad when some of the local corner-occupying heroin dealers got killed.

2586006,5,B000FTCLSU,One word:  wow! Many aspects are unexpected....but there are common elements that come back from previous seasons that continue the story.

2586024,5,B000FTCLSU,"Season 3 is the best one in a series that, from beginning to end, is nothing short of a masterpiece. Tough problems are tackled with gritty realism portrayed by characters that are authentic in every way. My belief is this is the show that is responsible for launching the big time big screen career of Idris Elba, an actor currently being considered for the role of the next James Bond-by the way, he should get it. The Wire is an American TV classic that no one should miss.",1473638400,,476,4.420454545454546

2586044,5,B000FTCLSU,"I think ""The Wire"" is one of the top 5 TV series of all time in terms of the writing, the filming and the accuracy of the depiction.  I watched all 60 episodes over the 5 seasons to understand the story and the characters and then I went back and watched all 60 episodes again to focus on the culture and the values of all the groups -- the police, the organized gangs, the people living in those neighborhoods, the schools, the politicians and so on.  And it's interesting how you come away having empathy for each of those entities while at the same time you see how those various entities are falling short of what they could be doing to help resolve the the disfunction in our inner cities.",1473465600,,694,4.3307692307692305

I wish it had the perfect sense of pacing that say, Breaking Bad, had... season 3 in particular did seem to drag in some scenes.  The plot line is a challenge to follow, but that also makes it fun.

Sure, there's the requisite amount of gunplay and savagery, but, after all, the drug trade is not lawn bowling.

Gritty and sadly realistic, The Wire brings together a collection of talented cast members, amazing writing and direction, and creates a tight story line and a pace that moves perfectly from scene to scene.  No unnecessary cliff hangers, or dramatic pauses to fake hype the scene, just smooth storytelling.  If anyone has debated over whether or not to watch The Wire. Do it - Start season one and commit to watching three episodes.  If you aren't hooked, walk away - no harm no foul. But there is so much depth to the characters - the police, the criminals, the politicians, and all the others that hold Baltimore together, I'm confident that if you start, you will watch all five seasons.",1470009600,,723,4.768

The different story lines never get old or boring, there is plenty to stay focused on.

2586389,5,B000FTCLSU,"All three seasons are absolutely riveting!  Some of the best acting I've ever seen . . . and from unknowns, back when the show was produced.  Some of the best writing and execution I've ever encountered--characters, plot lines, realistic details, on-the-spot-perfect language and diction for the locations, violent and sexual realism that was necessary for the story, rather than for gratuitous shock value.  The series assumes that the audience is intelligent and doesn't need any coddling, recaps, blatant ""spoon-feeding"":  the audience needs to pay attention to every single little snippet within an episode: a 10-second section of the story line is just as important as a five-minute focus . . . if you miss it or can't process it, you lose a key part of a future section.  The music is also a ""character"" and is not used to tweak or manipulate the audience's emotions.  In the end, you feel like you have been right there in the hood or police station, or bar, or house--not observing, but a silent participant.  I recommend the series to somebody almost every day!",1466726400,,1070,4.911111111111111

2586454,4,B000FTCLSU,"They say this is President Obama's favorite show - or one of them. It is my belief that the better tv series are both a commentary on and pleading to society. One way they do this by capturing something elemental in all of human nature in each of the characters so that we identify with all of them to some degree, and eventually see that each of us is part of the whole, all of us are one. In today's reality, I think tv has a role in how we decide determine (or act out) our future. This season left me wondering about the role of hope and whether we are entering into a new dark/middle ages. I thought the way the role of institutional racism was overly dealt with was honest and potentially helpful to society. That conversation is spreading today, and I hope that someday we will have enough comfort and language to speak about it at a wide enough range that we can reform.",1465776000,2,878,4.263473053892215

2586584,5,B000FTCLSU,"""The Wire""  All 5 seasons is the BEST Television series ever made.  The series was only nominated for 2 Emmys (both for writing). This is why Hollywood based Emmy Voters said they didn't vote for the series. They couldn't relate to its drug-infested Baltimore milieu, they didn't see the actors and producers around Los Angeles because they shoot on location in Maryland, and the plots are too hard for them to follow.

This series presents Baltimore in 5 different arenas:  Drugs, The Port, Elections, The Schools and The decline of Newspapers.  The writing is phenomenal.  Every actor, whether professional or first time actor, is terrific.  i have watched the whole complete series at least 4 times and every time, I find something new to love about it.",1463875200,,756,4.905511811023622

2586642,4,B000FTCLSU,"Though not the best season of the series (my opinion), the series overall is one of the few police shows I watched which I felt strongly resembled the politics of real policing. The street cops know what must be done and what leads must be followed to solve a case. But getting from A to Z in a case is plagued by mostly internal politics and self-interest by those all the way up the line. I suppose it resembles life all too often, in that self-serving actions derail duty and nobility of purpose. Any cop has likely seen this, and this show has so many snippets of reality, even in a small agency, such as the line Carver says when he watches some gang-bangers beat up on each other, ""You see. This is why we will never win. When they screw up they get beat. When we screw up, we get a pension.""

Seeing many unethical things get swept under the carpet, one must learn the reality, ""Never let progress get in the way of your politics."" Much good work has been stifled and many noble principles ignored to protect the name of the agency or someone standing high in it's ranks. It never seems to be about real accomplishments, just the perception -read ""spin""- of accomplishments.",1463184000,6,1181,4.442396313364055

Bravo to the writers and their ability to create and maintain a story line, the actors whose characters show the range of emotions and at times disbelief in the ENTIRE system.
THE WIRE is more relevant today than the seasons during which it was created.

The character development is well done and so realistic that you feel as if you were in the ""smoke filled room"".with the Mayor and other politicians.
The police have a tough job, separating the hardcore form those who need a break in life. They seem conflicted at times and laser focused at others,  Baltimore has look very good and very sad, no dichotomy, just truth.

2587118,5,B000FTCLSU,I live in Baltimore and love the references to things that actually exist in Baltimore the streets they name look like that same corner.  It's very realistic compared to other shows that may shoot 1 episode in Baltimore or Maryland and can't even get the name of the town match a town that exists in Maryland. Good job HBO /David Simon this has intrigued me to watch the corner next since I work on the corner that mini series was shot.  Also by HBO &  David Simon,1455580800,,464,4.310344827586207

2587159,5,B000FTCLSU,"The Wire is, quite frankly, the Greatest Show ever.  Breaking Bad gets its due but it's complete fantasy fiction. The Wire is real, piecing together true stories David Simon witnessed, and wrote about in his Homicide book. But than it's SO much more, the character development, the acting, the dialogue, the true life circumstances of drugs, crime, murder, with the corrupt and innefficient law enforcement run by politicians is the canvas. Brave men and women in the BPD fight against the institutional mayhem, the War on Drugs. The politicians need stats to be elected or re-elected. The results, are terrible and given great treatment in The Wire. Police officers with self awareness love the show too, for its honesty.

  In this season more so than others, the officers themselves are the heroes of the show.  The institutions are the villains. ""The Gods"" in David Simon's words, The Wire is Greek Tragedy with the heroes fighting against Fate and the Gods. The Gods, are the Institutions of the Modern City.  The BPD. The Gangs. The School System, the Political System.  This season had a very big story about a precinct captain Im not going to name because I don't want anyone googling and spoiling themselves.
Our Democracy, creates so many terrible dilemmas, we all want less drugs, our solutions? Increased suffering, death and prison population.  War on drugs isn't really a war.

I could not watch this with my children or my grandchildren - no way!  All that said I think it shows the very evil side of the drug trade by the lowest and mid-level pushers in Baltimore.  This series should be available for responsible adults.

2587283,5,B000FTCLSU,"The Wire is one of those programs which both gets better and changes as it moves along.  The premise is always the same: A Wiretap.

Season 3 centers in McNulty's obsession in taking down the Barksdale and Bell crews.  The regular crew, Herc and Carver (in diminished roles), Griggs, Sydnor, Prez,  ""The Bunk"", Pearlman, Sgt. Jay Landsman, Freamon, McNulty, Bubbles and the LT, Cedric Daniels.  This season also introduced Bunny. Major Howard Colvin (Robert Wisdom), the commander of the Westside.  The man who ""legalized"" drugs in the eyes of the Mayor, Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner.

On the side of the bad guys we have Avon, Stringer, Prop Joe, Omar, Slim Charles, Poot, Bodie, and a slew of red shirts (expendables), Brother Mouzone, a very unique hitman and Sen Clay Davis.

This is all out war for the battle of good and bad.  With the wiretaps in place, even for the limited time with the gangsters using ""burners"", Freamon and crew.  McNulty being McNulty is so narrow minded that new manages to get himself in trouble over his obsessiveness.

The Wire is a program for serious viewers.  Sure, there's some comedy but this is great drama.",1454198400,,1154,4.861538461538461

2587395,5,B000FTCLSU,gosh i have put off writing this reviewfor at least a week.  its like this. full disclosure  i own this series on dvd. have owned it for years.  i own all 5 seasons. quite possibly one of the best shows ever televised in the last 20 years. i know the script for this series.  i knew the deacon was an ex drug dealer years before he passed away last week. yes melvin passed last weekend.  season 3 is the culmination of the whole stringer avon barksdale story. when brother muzzone and omar finally see eye to eye one knows stringer is in trouble. this has been a hoot watching this on amazon.  but with honesty i may wait some time before watching season 4.  the only good part of that season is the saving of bubbles.  but for me the main story concludes with the season 3 ending. now marlo takes control.  omar takes lots of druge from the dealers and we spend lots of time in school.  another review for another day peace out,1449619200,,928,4.251428571428572

Other than that, I loved it. I honestly hope that real life in the projects isn't like that, but I've probably been too sheltered. God help us if it really is like that.

But the realism of a major American city sinking in a bog of corruption, crime and degradation is shocking and frightening. The same problems destroyed once-magnificent Detroit.

2587662,5,B000FTCLSU,Season 3 of The Wire gets back to focusing on the Barksdale drug organization.  In this season they are forced out of their territory after the city urbanizes the area.  They must take over new territory and deal with rival gangs who are also trying to claim these spots as their own.  Once again the writing of the story is unmatched by any other crime TV show that I have ever seen.  You just cant get this good of a picture of a crime-ridden inner city than what The Wire will give you.  The third season introduces some new storylines as we see how political corruption and money affect the justice system and how unfair some of this stuff can be. The Wire continues to amaze me and is deservedly regarded as one of the greatest TV shows of all-time.,1444521600,,754,4.357142857142857

There are good and bad guys on both sides.  It showcases the plight of the poor unconnected citizens verses the powerful, political city government.  There is a lot of violence (on both sides); it sets back civil rights decades.  It screams for reform and hope.

It is difficult to watch and hard to listen to because of it's themes and language but that is a significant part of it's realism and appeal. An American and world tragedy of epic proportions exploding in profound nuance. It's brilliant! Massively entertaining and equally dark. It is nothing short of poetry.,1444176000,,358,4.698412698412699

2587694,5,B000FTCLSU,Awesome show. Great cast and a message that transcends the basic police drama. The bigger picture here is that corruption happens at all levels and not everything is as it appears on the surface. This show will make you think and is still relevant all these years later.

Everything is in this series, from urban life and strife, to drugs, drug dealing, distribution, and big business of the drug industry and how it overlaps into all areas of our bureaucracy .  Then the multiple layers of our legal and political systems are well defined with their problems, PC issues, race, and how they all overlap and impede each other from being effective.  Mr. Simon's experience as a reporter has made him more than well qualified to produce such an excellent, exciting, and gripping series.",1442361600,,588,4.745098039215686

We see how the various street level organizations work, but still are not entirely clear on the very big players involved, although they are referenced. Stringer Bell is played brilliantly by an actor whose names escapes but I know he's British.

I love that in season 3 we get back to Stringer and Avon. In the past we've seen, I'd say the politics of police work, but this season you get to see the big picture of politics. We get to see really the chain of command from the mayor down to the chief of police and the majors etc. I don't want to spoil anything but this pressure causes an interesting take on the drug problem.

If you're a fan of the past two seasons of the Wire, I certainly think you'd enjoy this one.",1439596800,3,650,4.078125

The plot can get complex and I like being able to watch it in a condensed time frame. This season brings back a lot of the players from season 1 and resolves some of the story arcs from there. As always with The Wire, it takes a few episodes to get into it, but that is because it has to lay a foundation in order to build the watcher towards the climax.",1439164800,,466,4.188888888888889

2588077,4,B000FTCLSU,"Season 1 was about the pagers and the ""Towers"".  Season 2 was about the docks and the dead girls in the box.  Season 3 is about Stringer Bell's attempts to go legit (or become and even bigger gangster by playing in the big leagues, perhaps?).  It's also about Hamsterdam, Major Colvin's program to clean up his street corners by declaring an abandoned (mostly) neighborhood an arrest-free zone for drug dealers.  There is a scene in one of the episodes where the Major says that if they don't cooperate there will be 'Old Testament treatment before they even get to the station'.  A chilling example of life imitates art.  On the whole, I haven't found this season, after several episodes, to be quite as compelling as the first two, but, I understand from friends who have viewed the whole series that it's setting the viewer up for bigger dramatic rewards later on.",1436918400,2,867,4.708609271523179

2588138,5,B000FTCLSU,"The Wire remains the most accurate and unvarnished depiction of urban America in Television history. The show is both an artistic masterpiece of cinema in the TV medium and a near-documentary representation of reality on the streets of inner-city America. There has never been a television show that so carefully curates the living history of a major city. The sights, sounds, characters and dialogue are a virtual symphony of urban realism that has never before or after been captured by this medium. Make no mistake, the true star of this show is The City of Baltimore - but then the exact locale of its content is almost irrelevant as its portrayal of urban reality could be any major city in America. The show manages to be prosaic and poetic; canonizing and critical (of city life in Baltimore); objective and editorial; Skakespearean and colloquial. I know of no TV show that has reached such lofty levels of high art while making no compromises in its visceral portrayal of decidedly uncomfortable subject matter (The complex multi-layered problems of urban America).  I've not seen a better television show of any kind than The Wire - period. Bravo! To David Simon and the incredibly skilled writers of this television epic.",1435622400,,1232,4.980582524271845

It should be required viewing for every social worker, teacher, parent or human being who has any influence over a child and how that child is raised....the main message of this show is what happens to children when their parents are so damaged they cannot do what is in the best interests of the child.  Heart braking to see how human lives are lost due to people not being able to do the right thing.  From the corrupted elected officials, cops who do not do their jobs, mothers who are walking advertisements for ""this is what you will become if you do drugs- alcohol etc...and children who want to do the right thing but do not have any support and are pulled into lifestyles they never wanted...it also addresses the horrifying fact that many grow up to be sociopaths and run havoc wherever they go.

2588236,5,B000FTCLSU,"""The Wire"" is quite possibly the best television series ever made. Plot is excellent, acting is spot on, and it's portrayal of how serious and devastating it really is for our inner cities that we have lost the war on drugs is stunning. The premise of this season seems unlikely, that a major unit commander in the Baltimore Police Department would be able to establish a ""safe haven"" for drug dealing to free up his resources and create a climate in which he could rescue some areas of his district from the ravages of the drug trade. In fact, something like this actually did happen, and the third season is based on a real effort. Because its cast is mostly non-white, it gives the viewer a chance to see some terrific acting from many performers not normally featured in prominent television roles. Some of the cast though have made an impact on TV; Idris Elba went on to star in the BBC's ""Luther"", Lance Reddick did Lost and Fringe, but my favorite is Wendell Pierce, who plays Det. Bunk Moreland. At any rate, great cast and riveting storyline.",1433721600,,1051,4.595744680851064

It is especially compelling because of its imitative forecast of real life events and social forces in the same locale, Baltimore. In terms of real life current event it would be brilliant to create new Seasons of The Wire right now. Although the language (over-the-top usage of forms of the F word and MF word by all social strata) might have been overdone, it did serve to create a sense of social reality even if over-dramatized.",1432944000,,495,4.636363636363637

2588311,3,B000FTCLSU,"The Wire is a well-done cop series, however, I've given up on it because of the excessive nudity, sex and filthy language. My only observation is that it was chillingly prophetic of the current situation in Baltimore. It is a very realistic view of a city sinking in its own muck and garbage and despair, a city held hostage to socialist welfare and a Democratic strategy to keep blacks down on the plantation  that's the Democrat plantation. It's not ""corners"" or ""free zones"" anymore. The reality is mass anarchy, depravity, riots, arson and murder that dramatically demonstrates how Baltimore then came to be Baltimore now. In that respect, it is great drama.",1431993600,,662,4.910714285714286

The camera goes from one short scene to the next and characters pop up quickly before it all has time to solidify in my mind.  We watch it with closed captions to we can follow the dialogue better.  All that said the series overall is exceptional.  I thought I'd give it a break for a while before watching Season 4, but I can now find myself actually missing some of the characters and wanting to find out how they are doing and what they are up to....like old friends.

The depth of understanding of important sectors of the U.S. community--life and education in the inner city, race relations, both heroic actions and corruption in the police department, business community, different levels of government, unions and the media--are compared and contrasted with the profound impact their actions/interactions have on real people lives.

I'm a stickler for that sort of thing. And I watched The Wire on HBO when it came out in it's original format. And I didn't even notice the difference. The show transforms to a 16:9 ratio very well without impacting the artistic quality of the series.

Season One hooked me, Season Two was less intriguing to me because of the emphasis on politics, but Season Three was captivating. I could not wait to watch the next episode.

Whoever wrote this must have had a pretty good source for his material.  It is a fascinating story, well worth watching.  There are one or two episodes in Season 3 that I refuse to watch because they include dog fights and I am an incurable dog lover and can not bear to watch those.  The stories about the people are compelling.  You wonder how they ever change their lives and of course, in most cases, they don't.  The one who was smart enough to see that he had to get out found himself at a loss when it came to dealing with recalcitrant construction crews.  Don't miss watching this.

2588894,5,B000FTCLSU,"Season 3 is arguably the best on ""The Wire"" series because of the tension illustrated between opposing factions on the same side of a conflict. Bunny Colvin employs an innovative approach to ""protect and serve"" the people of Baltimore, while delivering the reduction in crime requested by City Hall. Similarly, Stringer Bell brings structure and discipline to the business of selling drugs that achieves the same crime reduction goals wanted by the police and City Hall, but at the risk of tainting the Barksdale reputation. Each side, the law & the lawbreakers, has its innovators and their reactionary detractors. Throughout the season, the audience is chauffeured along a landscape of conflict that ultimately draw us deeper to the characters in advance of a dramatic conclusion.

2589170,3,B000FTCLSU,"I enjoyed seasons one and two but here it starts going down hill and with all the murder and mayhem I find myself asking, ""Who cares?""  Having watched the entire series, I would recommend watching the first two seasons and just stopping.  There are no more conclusions at the end off the series than there are at the end of season two.  They drag in the Baltimore school system, more crooked politicians, and the Sun newspaper for God knows why and he ain't tellin'.  Sub plots are left dangling.  Actions occur for which there is no connection to the plot and yet they are treated as if they are important.  Can't fault the acting.  Actors can only play the script and really using Baltimore for location shooting adds a certain sense of reality.  Only complaint I have there is that the traffic is a whole lot worse than portrayed.  For anyone thinking that the "" grittiness"" is enhanced, hasn't been to Baltimore.  Detroit and Philadelphia are the only places that are worse in the country.  The political corruption portrayed is very real and applies to the entire state not just Baltimore.  The state  is run on the Bubba system much like Mississippi.  You have white bubbas and black bubbas. but they function on the same level, both being arms of the democratic machine.  Pelosi is an example of Baltimore and Maryland politics, being the daughter and sister of Baltimore mayors.  In their day the connections were with the Mafia rather the drug lords but the politic are the same.  Best advice, stop watching after season two.",1419379200,,1534,4.706766917293233

Wasn't the best, but it definitely kept up the momentum of the series.  The youth were very good at acting and bringing to light the issues that are occuring not just in Baltimore but in general the things that occur, and despite this being an older show, it's still prevelant in today's society.

The writers, producers, directors, cinematographers, and actors truly deserve the academy award for a really outstanding  creation in the making of 'The Wire'.  And for television, this is truly an unusual and outstanding piece of film making, because as we all have experienced, much of what televsion produces truly caters to the the unthinking and unimaginative mind who appreciates redundant predictable repitition in television performances  the television series 'The Wire' is a modern day Charles Dickens American style  outstanding.",1418860800,,1115,5.271186440677966

2589226,5,B000FTCLSU,"""The Wire"" is one of the best written, most intricately constructed shows in story writing history.  Yes, a big claim, I know, however I obviously don't think this is an overstatement.  There's never a story line weakness, or dialog that feels contrived, or an element of the theme in which you feel like you're being manipulated or preached to.",1418256000,,345,4.830508474576271

It's like a Jackson Pollock on a gigantic canvas (over ten one-hour episodes in each of the five seasons). Well worth watching.",1417824000,,450,4.782051282051282

2589263,5,B000FTCLSU,"Love how realistic this show is. I don't know if Baltimore really has the sort of drug problems that this show depicts, but what I mean by how realistic it is is that it shows the good, the bad, the exciting, and the boring. It seems like sometimes things go the way for the antagonists and sometimes for the protaganists. It depicts realistic relationships between people that have their ups and their downs, but everyone finds a way to keep moving along. So many shows seem like they have to keep coming up with new, outrageous scenarios to keep people interested, but this show realizes the relationships and hardships of the main characters can be captivating television between the new big plot developments. Just a brilliant show all around and the 3rd season was very entertaining.",1417478400,,788,4.801470588235294

Season 2, the villians were painted too sympathetically for me. And nobody said it, but that port must have been stanky. Ugh! Back to Season three. By now Omar is the show's 5th Business, McNutty has learned to not be so hostile to the ex, and they remain off and running with the namesake of the show, this time with burners. Why are there only super-hot men? With apologies to the sexy women who are well-cast, they are simply not drop-dead gorgeous. Yet several of the men are. This is annoying. Why am I reviewing this?

2589279,5,B000FTCLSU,"This whole series could be the best dramatic series that TV ever had.  The basic plot follows the ""drug war"" on the streets of Baltimore and the wire-taps (ie, ""The Wire"") used to track the drug lords.  Each season has two things that change for that season:
  1) The same theme song is used throughout the 5 seasons (""Way Down in the Hole"", written by Tom Waits), but each season it's sung by a different singer/group and in a different style.  In season 3, that's the Neville Brothers.  Can't do much better than that.  And,
 2), Each season focuses on a different facet of Baltimore life and how that affects and is affected by the local drug problem.  In season 3, the show focuses on the city and state politicians...and a nasty bunch they are.  If you want to see how local politicos REALLY run a city, this is the show to watch.

So, if you want  TV drama done as it should be done, stop watching today's so-called ""reality shows"" and watch real drama.  But start with season 1 and work your way up.  You won't be disappointed.",1417219200,,1034,4.402116402116402

The level of detail they go into to describe police work is my favorite part.  The cops aren't totally good, the bad guys aren't totally bad.

Perhaps The Wire, given its limited mission, was destined to fall sooner than the others, but season three definitely shows all the signs of a lost story. What was once fun--stake outs, busts and interview room workovers, office politics, power intrigue, McNulty drunkenness--have all become things for cast and crew to do while nothing happens.

2589455,5,B000FTCLSU,"Another great season for The Wire.  This season revolves around an examination of whether or not ""decriminalization"" of drugs  might work out if tried.  Instead of the normal debate among talking heads, we're treated to a dramatization of how a possible scenario might play out.  I was especially impressed by the way in which the series avoided the political landmines so common in other series which generally try to sell their point of view.  Season 3 is as well done as the other seasons.

No matter how far out the Wire characters act, they make their psychopathic ""business"" decisions rationally, whether coldly or hot headed reaction, move and counter move.  There are no fools; no super geniuses; just normal people making sometimes good; sometimes foolish decisions, resulting in planned and unexpected outcomes.  The sub plots as well are thought provoking, and interesting.

They also learn and develop from season to season.  All in all, still the best cop series ever!  The usual 30 or 40 ""f"" and ""n"" bombs are in each episode; also, a quick lesbian soft core porn scene appears in one of the latter episodes, as well as an interracial coupling - but for most adults, this remains one of the most rewarding shows you can watch.",1413417600,,1240,4.857142857142857

Everyone is in a state of flux, a little lost, from the police task force to Avon's crew to the hoppers and even the characters themselves.  Season Three looks like a transition.  I say this because I haven't seen seasons four or five yet, so I'm being patient.

2589569,4,B000FTCLSU,I enjoyed The Wire Season 3 very much after suffering through a weird tangent plot lines in Season 2.  I feel like the writers got back to the basics of what made Season 1 so good and they did a fine job of transitioning story lines with the well-known characters and introducing new ones.  My advice is to skip Season 2 and watch Season 3 instead.  I really don't think you will experience too many gaps in the drama.,1410998400,,418,4.265822784810126

2589577,5,B000FTCLSU,"The plot moves along from season one, tying in some of the slower moving plot of season two. I'm glad we're off the docks and back on the streets.

2589578,5,B000FTCLSU,"Wow! HBO has done it again. Season 3 of The Wire is off the chain. Another conglomeration of edgy, mesmerizing cinema about the unfolding of Baltimore life surrounding Detective Jimmy McNulty.

But now that Amazon has the series, and for the best price, I figured, ""why not?""
Turns out all the shambling zombies muttering about McNulty and Herc under their breath were right. It's the rare thing that lives up to its hype, and every season of The Wire has done so in spades. I have to admit to having a bit of a tougher time getting on-board with Season 4, but I'm sure I'll settle in with it eventually.",1410393600,,715,4.303703703703704

2589622,4,B000FTCLSU,Great show but can move a little slow at times.  Also the feed doesn't seem to have hi Def so it doesn't fill the wide screen tv.  I assume because it was filmed around 2003.  But it's still very well done and has great acting.,1410220800,,227,4.0

2589755,5,B000FTCLSU,"My previous review was heavily censored by Amazon.  Which is okay when you are an ostrich.
This gives me the opportunity to tell you that this series is, without doubt, a concerted effort for whites to feel superior looking down on the black race as foul mouthed drug dealers and users, sex fiends and murder central, normally, black on black.  And along comes the white knight to become mayor of a heavily black city.  This 5 year series goes way over the top of any other ""cops and robbers"" series I have ever watched.  I would have to say that all of you that were entertained by this series are ready to join the KKK.  Amazon says to ""identify specific attributes"", which I did in my first review.  It's an [expletives deleted] piece of [expletives deleted].
In real life, I do feel sad that so many young blacks are sucked in by the dope kings but if they cannot get legit jobs and have spending money, which a young man needs, then society needs to put the hammer down on the drug buyers, whether holding for use later or by blood analysis, already high.
Thanks to the ACLU, the courts had to release to the streets those with mental problems and which are the homeless living under the road and train overpasses and elsewhere.",1407888000,,1233,4.482142857142857

2589817,5,B000FTCLSU,"The Wire continues to set the bar for exceptional drama; gritty and unflinching, about the only criticism I can make of this show is that if you come to it without watching at least Season One first, you'll quickly find yourself lost in the complex maze of characters and happenings.

As to the show as a whole, I would strongly suggest that if you like Breaking Bad, you will enjoy this show even more.  Why?  Because while BB is a gripping and relentless drama, there still is an air of unreality to it.  The Wire is as close to real as one can get, to the point where it feels like a documentary at times... almost as if you could drive to those streets in Baltimore and see the faces on your TV screen populating the corners.  And the storylines are just as compelling and involving as those of Breaking Bad.

As for the casting, I have never seen a collection of such good actors: quite literally, I can't think of an actor who seemed miscast.
So-
Story: A+
Casting: A+
Acting: A+
Direction: A+

...I literally can't think of a better show.  Breaking Bad is a close, close second, but The Wire is simply the best show I've ever seen on TV.

2589891,5,B000FTCLSU,This is definitely an adult program.  It is well done though and it shows the problems that cause drug abuse and crime.  I think the best part of it is showing the damage that happens to the children.  It is intense and well written and unfortunately pretty believable. We have been binge watching The Wire for the past several weeks and have felt the show gets better with each season.,1405728000,,386,4.485714285714286

2589904,4,B000FTCLSU,"Excellent choices of actors, from women to boys to men. It's unfortunate that the language limits the portrayal of the tragedy of the social situation of these kids to adult viewing only. And the gratuitous pornography seals that limitation. The obligation writers and producers feel to leave no aspect of sexual situations or violence to the imagination in the process further limits the viewership of an otherwise well-written and well-played police procedural series.",1405468800,,470,5.4520547945205475

And one thing that disappoints me about Season 3 is that the show seems to be tipping into soap opera territory, where the hookups and the back-stabbing are the story, rather than the context for a story about drug dealers and investigators.

Let me add... whoever was responsible for the casting of The Wire must be a genius. The right people (actors) with just the right ""look"" , speech patterns and demeanor to make this series so realistic.
I didn't watch The Wire when it ran on HBO... But, now, I put my headset on and stream episode after episode into the wee hours of the morning.",1404691200,,646,4.725663716814159

2589993,2,B000FTCLSU,"This screams of inter office politics with HBO, I'm sure a bunch of no brain morons kept running around with polling results telling the writers how much people like Barksdale and String, and they should just re focus everything on these guys. I have a feeling if the writers could have they would have went a different way with this season.

Man talk about a lost dog in comparison to Season 1 and 2, they lost the ingenuity as well as that feeling of cold realism that made you feel like this was real life. Hamsterdam and all that focus on Stringer becoming soft, totally a loss for me. I think they got lazy and just went back to what worked in the first season. Season 2 was brilliant because of the new storyline and all the tie ins and the great new characters like the Greeks and the Sabotkas and Ziggy, all totally 100% believable and it was a whole new ride just like the first season.

Season 3 should have been a focus on the CID team working on a crooked contractions union, similiar to the Dock Workers Union Storyline, and corruption with the senator and then they could have had the tie ins with Stringer and Avon  but still had a new set of interesting characters and a believable storyline.

It really stinks in my opinion, I lost that feeling I had for this show, I might have to re watch season 1 and 2 to get it back, hopefull S4 won't disappoint.",1403654400,,1368,4.33203125

The developers and politicians get rich and the working poor lose what little they have. The situation in Baltimore is repeated time and time again in cities across the United States as industry shuts down and working people can't make ends meet. Oakland, California, Seattle,Washington, Detroit, Michigan, Dayton, Ohio, Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania, and the list goes on.

The incredible acting and realism are there for sure and there is nothing wrong with what they do show.. only with what is missing. So far in my opinion , best to worst are seasons 2,1,3, and finally 4. I am sure season 5 will be amazing being the end and will probably place season 4 in a different context for me. For now ..

This show also shows the reality of the crimes. Money breeds corruption and drugs are an extension of that corruption on every level.

It brings in actual events and uses some citizens to play different parts. So glad for Amazon Channel..I missed this series when it showed  originally. Overall I give the entire series a 5 *****",1401840000,,370,4.211267605633803
2590069,5,B000FTCLSU,Characters are gritty. Things sometimes don't work out as planned and that makes it real. Love that every season has a different focus on an aspect of Baltimore. You get a clear sense of how things really work or don't work.,1401840000,,224,4.487804878048781
2590070,4,B000FTCLSU,"Writing and acting is terrific. Hard to watch day after day, you might need a break in between episodes because it is painful to watch. It seems so real it seems like a documentary.",1401753600,,181,4.352941176470588
2590071,5,B000FTCLSU,This was just an epic season.  You had the classic Cain and Able relationship with the drug dealers.  I don't think there was a weak episode in whole season.  The only flaw I see is everyone seems to think McNulty is a genius.  I just don't see it.,1401753600,,248,4.104166666666667
2590072,5,B000FTCLSU,"This is another fantastic show created by HBO. This is a gritty show that depicts the life of drug lords and the cops in Baltimore, MD.",1401753600,,135,4.230769230769231

2590074,5,B000FTCLSU,"One of the best series ever.  Shot like a reality TV show, but with the quality of a movie.  All the major players are flawed humans with good sides, even the bad guys.  It explains why so many black men are dead or in prison for most of their lives.",1401753600,,250,3.96
2590075,5,B000FTCLSU,"Once we started watching it, we couldn't stop.  Very adictive.  The characters are interesting and they all have problems like the real world.",1401753600,,142,5.130434782608695
2590076,5,B000FTCLSU,"I am in Law Enforcement, without a doubt the best Police Drama out there. A must see for all of us",1401753600,,98,3.7142857142857144

2590078,5,B000FTCLSU,and I'll put 5 stars next to it. You are wasting time reading reviews from halfwits instead of treating yourself to this modern television masterpiece.,1401667200,,151,5.08
2590079,5,B000FTCLSU,Completely engrossing! Form season 1 to season 5 could barely take my eyes of the screen! Wish there was one more season...,1401667200,,123,4.636363636363637

2590084,5,B000FTCLSU,Great series - can't believe I didn't know about this show until a few months ago.  Already halfway into Season 4. No TV drama show can compare to The Wire!,1398643200,,156,4.2

2590088,5,B000FTCLSU,Good show. Loved the first season Did not care for second season but third season goes back to what hooked me.,1396396800,,110,4.285714285714286
2590089,2,B000FTCLSU,"Which I didn't even notice, until the very biggest scene in the entire season, when Omar and Brother Mouzone kills Stringer, the video stopped playing.  Upon closer inspection, it turned out I was watching a pirated copy.",1395705600,,221,4.972972972972973

2590092,3,B000FTCLSU,"Many people refer to the Wire as one of the greatest shows ever.  I don't see it.  It's pretty boring compared to the actual greatest shows ever (Friday Night Lights and Breaking Bad).  It is, however, one of the best cop shows.  It will ruin most other cop shows for you because you'll see how ridiculous most of them are.  Watch it, but don't buy it.",1395532800,,352,4.2727272727272725
2590093,5,B000FTCLSU,"One of the DVDs had a small hiccup in Episode 6.  It got stuck and we had to fast-forward to avoid that part of the DVD, thereby missing a few minutes of that episode.  No other complaints.",1395014400,,189,4.081081081081081
2590094,5,B000FTCLSU,"Characters ring true to the police I have known.  In addition, spouses rarely have a complete 180 degree reversal of opinion toward a mate and this series does a fine job of depicting honest emotion between estranged partners.  Death is a remedy in the drug trade  and I loved the callus attitude of these characters.  Watch the entire series.",1394668800,,343,4.762711864406779
2590095,5,B000FTCLSU,"After Season 2 on the Baltimore docks, we return again to the projects and the streets. The Unit has survived and has had to develop new strategies and tactics in their efforts to survive the ""good guys"" as well as the bad.",1394496000,,223,4.333333333333333
2590096,4,B000FTCLSU,"This I am sure is not for everyone. There are times that it is even a little plodding in its pace, kind of like cops jobs really are. But man if you want to see how cops and drug dealers interact I think this is the show to watch. I also like the way each season builds. Like in season three disposable cell phones enter the mix, complicating the detectives efforts to get them on ""the wire"". Great series for people who like crime drama.",1394323200,,438,4.1647058823529415

2590109,4,B000FTCLSU,"After watching the first 3 seasons I have realized that nothing can come close to the first season. The second season started out way too slow and took a long time to catch up. The third season was a must watch, but it can not top the first season.",1390089600,,248,4.081632653061225

2590111,5,B000FTCLSU,"This was a gift for my husband (and me).  Since I gave him the complete set, we've been binge-watching them.  The only problem with binge-watching them is that it can get pretty depressing.  The first time we watched, we rented the discs from Netflix, so there was some time in-between episodes.  Made it a little easier.  Still, I'm glad I bought them.  Great show, great characters, great acting and too true.",1390003200,,411,4.71830985915493

2590116,4,B000FTCLSU,This show is brilliant! Binge-watched four seasons over the holidays. So I was able to really see the nuances of the complicated storylines woven across the seasons. There's always something unexpected. Lesser shows wouldn't make the bold moves that The Wire makes season after season. Truly great TV!,1389312000,,301,5.291666666666667

2590119,2,B000FTCLSU,"The first Season of the The Wire was really, excellent.  The second season was good.  On the third to last episode of Season 3 and it is wearing thin. It is not very realistic, the writing and plots have really deteriorated.  The acting was superb.  This was decent series.  Not even in the top ten of all time though.",1388361600,2,318,4.322033898305085

2590126,5,B000FTCLSU,"Absolutely love this show. Shocking that it never got nominated for best tv series (Emmy)- it should have won but to not even be nominated reeks of Politics. The stories are great and the actors are excellent. So much talent was developed on this show. I am craving another Wire style of series, something that is gritty, raw, provocative, and honest. I love seasons 1-3. I bought seasons 4 and 5 just to complete the collection: the stories aren't as strong but they are still good. Season 4 moves slow and finally takes off, season 5 seemed rushed and not fully thought out, but since this is about season 3: I do recommend it!",1385164800,,629,4.526315789473684

2590128,4,B000FTCLSU,"Season 3 of this outstanding series is not quite up to the excellence of seasons one and two. That's why it gets four stars instead of five. The plot was overall a little scattered, a little unfocussed.",1383696000,,202,4.486486486486487
2590129,5,B000FTCLSU,"Loved ""The Wire.""  Season 2 was okay. But. Season 3-5 was GREAT!!!!! If a person can get pass Season 2, then Season 3-5 is well worth it. Hate the show didn't continue.",1381795200,,168,4.25

2590138,4,B000FTCLSU,"A deep world with perhaps 40 characters who have substantial roles, but there are many great moments when you are vividly involved in an action, a scene, a dialogue that has enormous impact on your perception of the world of Baltimore police, politics, the street people who inhabit the drug selling life, and the people behind them.  And you realize more and more that these people and the social structures they live within have a lot to do with your world too, even if you live in a different part of America and you are not directly involved with the police, with drugs, or even with spending much time on the streets.",1376352000,,622,4.553571428571429

2590140,5,B000FTCLSU,"Quite possibly the finest television program ever made.  The Wire is a modern classic. I liked Season 3 better than Season 2, as it has more to do with Major Crimes getting back after the streets.  The whole series is intertwined to explain the web of crime and corruption.",1375660800,,273,4.551020408163265

The acting never failed being the very best.  We paid for each and every episode gladly; we certainly
got our monies-worth. The icing on the cake is the sub-titles; without them, we would have missed much
of the dialogue (little bits and pieces) and that was the key to our being willing to pay for the entire
series. This series brought us several weeks of real pleasure that is so rarely seen on TV.",1374364800,,510,4.604395604395604

2590154,5,B000FTCLSU,"For much of the first three years, Avon seems to take a backseat to his partner and childhood friend Stringer especially when he is in jail.  It's only when he corrects Stringer over his expansionist dreams that you realize that Avon's actually smarter and that scene where Stringer looks at him is very law of the jungle when you acquiesce to the superior force.

Avon's smarter.

Of course, the glamorous most beloved, most entertaining character is Omar and the loveliest most admirable character is Lester BUT Avon's SMART.  It would have been enjoyable to have gotten more of a taste of him especially against Marlo.

Each season has a different flavor and spirit and I think that Season 3 being a fan favorite has to do with lots of power play, action, posturing and none of the undeniable grief of children in jeopardy in Season 4 and the kind of winding down feeling of Season 5.  The deal with Season 2 is it just isn't about the fan favorites.  Season 1 was our shock introduction so it was just disturbing, upsetting, sad but of course, still easier to digest than ""The Corner.""

This season is the one with the grandstanding performances - the ""aren't they a treat?"" scenes.  I think I actually had to watch a lot of Omar scenes and episodes from this season to get myself to watch the series in sequence because the first episode of the series was a hard sell for me.

From the outstanding writing through so many stunning performances by a superlative cast, there's never been anything like this on TV.  I'm familiar with Baltimore and have traveled through some of areas portrayed in the series. I was a huge fan of ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" during its years on network, but ""The Wire"" ratchets up every aspect of production portraying the depth of characters and making every story it tells count for something.

2590194,4,B000FTCLSU,"Unlike the flaccid Season Two, this one begins with a bang but happily doesn't quite end with a whimper. You'll almost certainly need to watch the first episode at least a couple of times to make sense out of what's going on they have so many expository balls in the air at the same time. After this explosive beginning the show settles down into routine until the last two episodes where stuff starts to happen again. And that's the problem: the season has a huge sag in the middle where the three or four main strands of the story pretty well just tread water. For instance we keep on coming back to ""Hamsterdam"" where we are shown (again and again and again) controlled chaos in the street, cops standing around muttering in bemused tones, then they go on to something else, then back to Hamsterdam where we are shown controlled chaos in the street, cops standing around muttering in bemused tones, etc; almost exactly the same thing as before. This goes on for episode after episode until it comes time to wrap everything up at the end. And so it goes for all the other storylines: Stringer Bell's frustrated attempts to expand his horizons, McNulty's personal travails, Lestor Freamon's wiretapping endeavours, Tommy Carcetti's councilman-on-the-make manoeuvers, skullduggery and weaseling between the Mayor and Police Commissioner, etc. We keep on coming back and back and back and nothing has changed. Until those last two episodes.....

Throughout the whole season ""gritty realism"" is laid on by the shovelful to the point where it threatens to become the raison-d'etre of the entire show. Pretty well everyone swears five times as much as they do in real life but, hey, that's HBO, baby! There's an omnipresent crassness to the tone with an obvious ""boys will be boys"" ironic finger-wagging attitude about the things McNulty and Bunk get up to and which we're obviously meant to find uproarious. I'm all for Animal House-style crudities in their place but these guys just don't have the style for it. It all seems so fake as though the writers have concocted these episodes merely to give an ersatz ""colour"" to the characters. McNulty - I think - is supposed to be full of roguish charm. I say this because Dominic West (who play-acts his way through the role) keeps pulling faces and assuming expressions pantomimically suggestive of ""roguish charm"". He's the main weakness in a cast which contains a few excellent performances. Idris Elba as Stringer Bell doesn't seem to be performing at all; he just projects. And Wood Harris (Avon Barksdale) is almost as authentic while Aiden Gillen as Councillor Carcetti does a fine tight-mouthed Dustin Hoffman impression. Perhaps Michael K. Williams as Omar overdoes the ""outlaw"" element of the character but I love to watch the avenging devil go about creating mayhem.

Anyway, I find it hard not to conclude that this is a ridiculously overrated series in view of raves like ""the most perfect thing in the history of television"" and ""the best show in the history of television"". Sure, it's often interesting but the BEST show in the HISTORY of television?!!!!!! My guess for this critical over-enthusiasm?: it offers an educated and probably not overly-streetwise audience the seemingly authentic vicarious thrill of hangin' with the homies without the attendant risk of actually having to do so.",1303171200,,3350,4.96969696969697
2590195,5,B000FTCLSU,"Buying a television series on DVD is generally a wasted investment - once you watch the series rarely will you go back and watch it again. At best it would end up being a secret santa present or a rotating loan between friends and family. The Wire is different and actually worth the investment. The third season shifts the focus back to the Baltimore drug dealers and picks up where Season 1 left off. While the plot and characters specifically related to Season 1 aren't as gripping as the original season, this third season starts to highlight the political scene in Baltimore and incorporates many characters introduced in the second season. As with the first season, the beauty of the show lies in the careful character development and the attention to detail. There are no extra characters who appear in one episode never to be seen again - even the seemingly least important background character will come up again later in the season and again in subsequent seasons. More importantly there are no filler episodes in the season - each one is important to the plot of the season, the overall plot of the series and to the development of major and minor characters.

I wouldn't consider myself a tv junkie or a dedicated fan of crime dramas like Law & Order, but this series is simply too good to miss out on. Watching the season again, particularly after having watched the subsequent seasons, you gain an even greater appreciation for the character development and you pick up on a ton of details that didn't seem important the first time through.",1298592000,,1554,4.734317343173432
2590196,3,B000FTCLSU,"While the first two seasons of this series were excellent, the third really drops off in quality. Much of the story is redundant and the series starts to morally preach rather than tell a realistic story. There is good stuff in the season, but its about half of the content.

The good part of the season is the expansion of the series into the politics of city hall in Baltimore. The strength of the series overall is that it keeps adding to a ever-richer and more comprehensive view of the city by adding institutions and characters to the story. The understanding of how politics work in a city is first rate. The scripts ring true and all of the characters play to type. That is the good.

On the other side, the idea of the wiretap investigation is played out. So is Stringer Bell and Avon Barksdale as characters. So are most of the police characters. There just isn't anywhere new to go with any of this stuff that they have not already done in the first two seasons.

Equally bad is long blocks of the show devoted to lame ""message"" politics. The show basically plays out a ""what if"" with regard to legalization of drugs. But its completely contrived, false and idealized. Unlike most of whats in ""the wire"", everything assoicated with the subplot is basically garbage. Rather than show things in a realistic way as far as the positives and negatives of legalization, they are selling ""message"". There are ways a police captain might subvert the law for a while and create a defacto legalization of drugs. But the things shown in the wire are not how it would be done. A police captain could create an open-air drug market by selective enforcement. But a police captain could not create an open-air drug market guarded by the police and served by city social services.

The scripts and the acting are all fine. But show stepped down from a high level of realism into preachy television message drama. And it may still be better than 90% of television drama, but the star grade I've given is in terms of the show in competition with itself. And this third season is nowhere near the quality level of the first two seasons. (with the notable exception of the city hall and election portions).",1293494400,4,2197,4.596938775510204

2590199,3,B000FTCLSU,"I started watching The Wire in the Fall of 2009, buying the first season a few months before in an impulse buy fueled purely off word of mouth.  I popped in the first disc to Season One, having no clue that I was about to undertake one of the most enthralling and engaging storylines ever told on any medium.

The first season was transcendent, the second season was even better.  I bought the third season and anxiously awaited the third season in the mail, anticipating (from the cover) that Avon Barksdale would get out of jail and the conflict would resume between the Barksdale faction and the Major Crimes unit of the Baltimore PD.

But what I got most out of season three was disappointment.  The writers turned Barksdale into a caricature, a character bent on revenge who, from the street-smart ringleader we saw in season one, should know better.  I've tried to talk myself out of this point in a desperate attempt to justify Barksdale's need for revenge on Stanfield and his crew. It's obvious the major traffickers in The Wire are obsessed with status and reputation--we see it in season five when Chris had been hiding Omar's defiant challenge to Marlo to meet him in the streets, just to have Marlo throw a tantrum when he finds out that Omar had been calling him out--but it still didn't ring true with me.  I watched the drug dealers work the corners in the first two seasons thinking, ""These guys are smart, they know what they're doing, and they are way too level-headed and smart to get caught.""

Of course, we see Stringer try to contain him, but that's not the real point for me.  Avon never struck me as a vindictive character in the first season--maybe I got the wrong impression, I've slept a lot since then--but then he is all of the sudden hellbent on popping Stanfield?  Even as a viewer, the last person who should be able to predict what will happen in a season of The Wire, I can see that he will just destroy his empire in blind rage.

Brother Mouzone, while interesting and providing some great comic relief, seems to be another caricature, a cold-blooded killer who sits in the park and reads while waiting for the people he is paid to hit.  His complacency seems almost ridiculous in an environment where the most dangerous stick-up man in Baltimore was gunned down by a kid not even ten years old.  I kept waiting for someone to simply walk up and shoot him--I mean, that's really all it would take, right?

Also unbelievable is Major Colvin's experimentation with legalizing drugs.  Politically, it's a brilliant ploy by the writers to make a point, but not ultimately feasible to incorporate into the story.

Maybe it's my obsession with perfection that makes me consider The Wire in such absolutist terms--I was spoiled on the first two seasons.  To me, everything had to feel perfect.  Absolutely perfect.  And season three wasn't absolutely perfect, although it's still great, and it's really not up to debate that the third season of the show requires us to take the biggest leap of faith with the storytellers.  We have to take more for granted this season than any other season.

The season also picks up in media res, almost forcing the season's storylines on us in the first few episodes.  The other four seasons of The Wire has an inherent momentum to it, but it's not the first episode of the respective season that grabs you by the balls.  Instead, it's a cumulation of the first three or four episodes, all of them streaming together to predict the conflicts and threads that will play out in that season.

Season three makes one thing painfully obvious--the writers had decided before they started writing the season that they were taking the show in a different direction.  Barksdale's downfall seemed forced to move the story to another kingpin, and the legalization of drugs seemed forced to prove points about drugs.  These are not, in the grand scheme of things, cardinal sins, but they do make the season feel less...true.  Because of this, season three primarily serves as a bridge between the first two and last two seasons--a season that foreshadows the downfall of Barksdale and the rise of Stanfield, and continues to delve into the nature of addiction and the inevitability of drug use in America.  I absolutely love this show, but this was easily the weakest season.

The characters are compelling as all hell and by no means the cardboard cutouts one usually associates with television shows (or movies for that matter) dealing with African American drug lords, their enforcers and street sellers.  This series gives those characters depth and complexity unlike anything I've ever seen.  And the cops and politicians of Baltimore who also play a prominent role in the series are just as compelling and multi-dimensional.

Everything stops when i'm watching ""The Wire""..no phone calls, no computer, etc. This show is so serious that you have to stay focused on every part because if not you will get lost somewhere! I just finished season 1-4, and just ordered season 5 yesterday (3/2/10). It's so good that I paid for 2 day shipping to get it before Friday and I can't wait!
If you have any doubts about ""The Wire"" trust me, you'll be glad that you ordered/brought it!! I truely agree with people when said that it was the best thing on t.v. I LOVE IT!!! i can't get enough of it!",1267574400,,826,4.20125786163522

2590204,5,B000FTCLSU,"The third season astonished me:  its gets better, more mature, and addresses wider societal issues than the first two.  Though Barksdale is getting out of prison, which he partially engineered, his partner String has moved forward and begun a career as a developer with their drug profits.  This lands them smack in the middle of Baltimore politics, an arena in which they are neophytes.  String is also striving to create a more organized crime syndicate with old-rival Prop Joe.  Barksdale and String are also becoming suspicious of eachother, potentially ending a life-long partnership with deadly machinations.  Meanwhile, there is a new enemy on the horizon,  a young lion named Marlo who is willing to break the rules to get ahead; he is as cold as his rivals and exceedingly dangerous.  Finally, the politicians move to the center stage, in an unusual election campaign in which a white councilman attempts to split the black vote between the inept mayor and a young turk who is a personal friend.  This is the best dramatic tableau I have ever seen on TV.  Perhaps most astonishing for me, who never considered drug legalization a good option, was to get me to question my convictions.

The cops are somewhat more in the background on this one, but the team's case is very much alive.  The suspense in maintained right up to the end, which ends the first 3 seasons as a clear unit.  There are also many sub-themes, such as the code of the violent Omar, but also the disillusioned cop who pursues a kind of creation of legal zones to deal drugs.  The results are surprising and engaging.

Warmly recommended.  This series proves that TV can still experiment with great content and narrative.",1261008000,,1698,4.823529411764706
2590205,5,B000FTCLSU,"I may be one of the few who thought this third season of The Wire topped the previous two. The intercoiled plotlines, the emergence of some of the actors into greatness with their roles (Lance Reddick as Cedreic Daniels and Idris Elba as 'Stringer' Bell) plus a pair of bombshells regarding Det. 'Prez' Pryzbylewski (Jim True-Frost) and Commander Rawls (John Doman), and this made season three just stunning all the way around.

The focus on this season was politics and power, with the high power and the low. The Mayor sees trouble in his polling, so he makes the demand that crime stats must drop...or else. Stringer Bell needs to build his empire up and away from drugs while Avon barksdale is in jail, so he forms a coalition to sell dope while going straight...without Avon's knowledge. The cops are in the middle, and one of them, Major 'Bunny' Colvin (a fantastic Robert Wisdom) decides the only way to stop drug related crime is to stop arresting the criminals...and move them into crime-free zones in order to get them out of the neighborhoods. All the main activity thus revolves around ""Hamsterdam's"" rise and inevitable fall.

Along with the subplots that bring back Omar, Bubbles, Brodie, Attny Gen Rhonda, Brother Mouzone, Bunk and the rest make their mark. There's humor, suspense and an a tightly written story that picks up unbeliveable momentum as the store gets to the last three episodes. I had to sit with all three of the DVD's rather than wait to know what happened by that point. Great stuff, and the 4th season keeps the greatness coming.",1247270400,2,1564,4.788888888888889

2590207,5,B000FTCLSU,I know that it's a phrase that is said often regarding The Wire-but it is or was the best show on television. In a world dominated by reality and competition shows-the art of good scripted television is falling by the wayside. Every time I fall in love with a series its yanked off the air. Being a big Dennis Lehane fan it's no surprise that I would like this series. Not only is the writing pitch perfect but the performances appears effortless while being spellbinding at the same time.

2590208,4,B000FTCLSU,"The third season of ""The Wire"" takes aim at City Hall and the way politics subverts efforts to fight crime and put the bad guys away.
Most of the familiar characters are back, both good and bad guys (if you can tell the difference) and a few new ones are added.
The plot revolves around the decision by Police Major Colvin, who controls western Baltimore, to try a new experiment to cut the crime waves destroying his community. He designates three small areas as drug zones where police will not interfere in sales and trafficking as long as the hoodlums leave the rest of the neighborhood alone. As a result, crime drops and the neighborhood shows signs of renewal. Of course, when the police commissioner, the mayor and the media find out, all hell breaks lose.
Though still vastly superior nearly anything else on TV, I found this series a little less riveting than the previous two. Perhaps it's because of the growing feeling anyone watching these dramas must get that in the end it's all fruitless. Drug dealers and gang leaders come and go but the drug trade remains. One gang is broken up and its leaders sent to prison: another instantly rises to fill the gap. The market is always there and as long as there's big money to be made and no alternatives, someone will fill it. As my own research showed in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gates-of-Injustice-The-Crisis-in-America-s-Prisons-Prentice-Hall-Paperback/dp/0131881795/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gates of Injustice: The Crisis in America's Prisons (Prentice Hall Paperback)</a>&nbsp;the ""war on drugs"" has been a disaster for our inner-cities and our society as a whole.
In this series, we see that there's no honor among thieves. But there's no honor among politicians either. The one difference is that the thieves ultimately settle their differences with bullets.
Well, I'm going to plow on and see the next two seasons. Perhaps the greatest strength of ""The Wire"" is its all-encompassing view. We see one aspect of the problem after another. Heroic individuals struggle to redeem the city and themselves but the task is too great without a change of heart by society as a whole and massive government intervention.",1236556800,2,2227,5.240896358543417
2590209,5,B000FTCLSU,"Seasons 1, 2 and 4 lend themselves to solitary viewing one can do without having seen prior seasons and not getting the feeling you missed crucial plot elements.

Seasons 3 and 5 of ""The Wire"" conclude cliffhanger endings that will only add up if you watched prior seasons.

David Simon planned a five-part, five-season series here but by 2004, he wasn't completely sure if they'd be renewed yet (of course, they were), so he wrote this season powerful and complete enough to be a series end if necessary.

What viewers get is a masterfully written adventure that documents the downfall of Season 1's West Baltimore drug empire and the rise of a new one, a careful examination of the community's War on Drugs while also detailing just how screwed up and ineffective some of the city's basic institutions (City Hall, The Police) are, bogged down by politics, bureaucracy and conflicting interests.

Season 4 (Baltimore School System) is my personal favorite but Season Three is probably the most powerful of all five seasons because you see the great storylines at all levels -- the Streets, City Hall, the Police -- and get to see how clearly what effects/influences one directly effects and influences the others.

Chalked full of social commentary, bitter endings for some of the series' most popular characters and poetic justice for others.

A bonus to purchasing this Season's DVDs are the Special Features Q&A with the shows' writers, producers and cast members Idris Elba (Stringer Bell), Jamie Hector (Marlo Stanfield) and Seth Gilliam (Sgt. Carver).

""The Wire"" is so beloved for its presentation of complex moral issues, multi-dimensional character representations and realistic portrayals of the hypocritical world we live in.  This Q&A gives you an idea just how passionate fans of all races and socioeconomic backgrounds were (and continue to be) of this great, great show.",1235001600,,1886,5.10064935064935

However, after pushing thru, I ended up enthralled with the series and before the end of season one, we went online and purchased seasons 2 and 3.

Without giving away too much, season 3 focuses on the dynamics of Avon and Stringer and the empire they run. It touches on the players of the ""game"" and you will be amazed as to how far their ties go.

This season is not one to disappoint and will leave you looking for your fix of season 4 before you even finish this series. I highly recommend that you start by purchasing (or viewing) the first and second series before moving on to this one.",1229904000,,815,4.217948717948718

2590216,5,B000FTCLSU,"""The Wire"" tracks the decay of a major American city, in this case, Baltimore.  The third season focuses on the street level struggle between gangsters for control of the drug trade, the desperation of the police to show measureable progress in their fight against narcotics, and the political maneuvering at the highest levels of municipal government.  There is much more going on as well in this complex, intelligently scripted series, far too much to touch upon in a brief review.

Just in case my opening paragraph makes the show sound too cerebral, rest assured that it rests on a foundation of engaging characters and gritty storylines.  We have McNulty (Dominic West), the dedicated cop whose personal life is a shambles, Stringer Bell (Idris Elba), the ruthless drug lord trying to become a legitimate businessman, Bubbles (Andre Royo), the good-hearted junkie who feeds information to the police, Tommy Carcetti (Adrien Gillen), the councilman with designs on the mayor's seat who struggles with balancing his idealism with political expediency, Major ""Bunny"" Colvin (Robert Wisdom), whose radical solution to the drug plague will shake the city from top to bottom, and far too many more to list here.

If you haven't seen this show before, begin with the first season.  I began with this season and I was sometimes confused because of situations or characters that continued from previous seasons.  You can still get your bearings and enjoy the show if you are an attentive viewer, but I think it will be more rewarding to watch events unfold in their proper order.",1229212800,,1575,5.057915057915058

2590219,5,B000FTCLSU,"With its third year, The Wire heads back to the streets and unfinished business. As with the second year, the third season opens up another dimension of the city, this time City Hall and the civil and police administration, but the focus is squarely back on the Barksdale organisation and Lt. Daniels' unit trying to bring them down and finish the job begun back in Season 1.

Season 3 opens with Avon Barksdale still inside, but his parole hearing is coming up. His friend and collaborator Stringer Bell has guided the crew through some lean times and formed a 'co-op' with several other gangs which has led to them making some serious money but at the cost of sharing each other's turf. However, a new player, Marlo Stanfield, is on the way up and is not interested in sharing his territory with anyone else. The stage is set for a series of bloody showdowns and bodies dropping on the streets, to the growing discontent of the police. Lt. Daniels and his unit are forced to drop their investigation into Bell (begun at the end of the second season) to concentrate on the war, unaware that the two are connected. This war is complicated by the re-emergence of Omar Little, who has sworn to bring down Bell for manipulating him into shooting an innocent man in the second season.

At the same time, an ambitious white city councilman, Tommy Carcetti, is planning to run for mayor, although his prospects in a city with a majority black population seem poor. Connecting these two storylines is a highly controversial initiative launched by police Major Colvin to move the drug dealers off the street corners into three abandoned city blocks where the police will turn a blind eye to their activities so they can concentrate more on murders and crime prevention elsewhere. The 'Hamsterdam' storyline, apparently inspired by the 'legalise drugs' movement, is a stunning and surprisingly even-handed piece of social commentary. There is also an ongoing subplot following the attempts of former Barksdale enforcer Dennis 'Cutty' Wise to go straight after spending fourteen years in prison.

Season 3 is tighter than the second season, as it is able to link the storylines together more effectively than the second, where the trials of the Barksdale gang were largely removed and separate from events on the docks. The new characters, both on the streets and in the city hall, are also more directly tied to the storylines that have gone before and are stronger as a result.

Thematically, the idea behind Season 3 appears to be that of failed reform. The failure of the city's drug prevention strategies encourage some radical, out-of-the-box thinking from Major Colvin. Whilst his policy is initially successful, it leads to a whole host of knock-on effects which are beyond his powers to address, and give a rather depressing impression that, indeed, no one man can make a difference to the system. The breathtaking cynicism and corruption of the political wing of the city is depicted, with Carcetti determined to reform the system from the inside, again with apparently little hope of success. Stringer Bell's attempts to reform himself and his friend Avon on his release from prison into respectable businessmen provides the season with its main narrative spine, but again does not have a happy ending. That said, there are moments of hope, with Cutty's attempts to go straight finally garnering some success and McNulty's attempts to straighten out his personal life ending on a positive note.

The ending of the season seems to be a little more definitive than the prior two, but the writers take care to leave enough loose ends untied to be pursued into the fourth year, with the candidates for mayor squaring up, several of the gang leaders still very much at large and the police unit once again finding themselves heading off in separate directions.

The Wire: Season 3 (*****) follows up on the first two by being just as dramatically intense with some superb characterisation, brilliant acting and some finely-judged moments of comedy to balance the darkness elsewhere.",1224460800,2,4078,4.945985401459854

The season picks up and refocuses back on the Barksdale Organization so our Season 1 favorite gangsters are back - and our Season 1 - 2 favorite cops are back. This season also adds a new element - the politicians. While the cops like McNulty, Freemon, Greggs, et al go after Stringer (Idris!), Avon, et al, new characters are introduced with a NEW GAME to follow: Mayor Royce, Councilman Carcetti, and their game with Police Commissioner Burrell et al. A new youngblood Marlo is also introduced to add some good ole' gangsta warfare.

This season has it all. The same social-political themes, the academic and cinematographic nuiances - all string the story lines along. But now, you got the good ole cops and gangsta games, gangsta wars, and political wars. There is so much action between the underhanded political games to the blazin action on the streets.

If you have not seen The Wire, this is THE season to start - you will love it and fall in love with it.

2590230,5,B000FTCLSU,"HBO's The Wire is the best television I've ever seen. Creator David Simon and writer Ed Burns have crafted something that's utterly unique among contemporary TV dramas - a complex, gripping and believable portrait of a city (Baltimore) and its struggle to rise above the poverty, corruption and violence that seeks to bleed the life out of it.

More akin to a novel in its thorough exploration of character and motive, social and historical context, each season of The Wire unfolds in a series of chapters which must be taken as a whole. Seen through the eyes of both the Baltimore PD surveillance team, and the drug's gangs that control the inner-city housing projects, this is the American dream gone bad - an unapologetically political insight into why the largely black underclass have been failed by the machinery of government.

Season 3 takes us back to season 1's plot arc, as Stringer Bell holds temporary control of the `business' in Avon Barksdale's enforced absence. The times they are a changing as the towers are pulled down, and rival gangs fight for control of the corners. The tension between the two main men once Avon is released from prison, as each strives to impose his own vision (Stringer's to create a legitimate business empire, Avon's to let the street know who is king), leads to an unforgettable outcome. This leaves the door open for other crews to muscle in on their former territory, resulting in a bloodbath in West Baltimore. The Mayor and the Police Commissioner are desperate to keep the bodycount down as the election looms, leading to Major Colvin adopting his own eye-opening solution to the problem.

Meanwhile McNulty continues to p**s off anyone who doesn't agree with his methods, Prez makes a fatal error of judgement and Omar carries on wielding his own unique brand of vigilante justice against Barksdale's crew.

New characters Cutty, an ex-con fresh out of jail and fighting against the pull of the gang life, Tommy Carcetti, the ambitious councilman looking to run for mayor, and Marlo, the ambitious young gang leader looking to establish a foothold on the street, join the other established characters in a season that  first matches, and then exceeds the dizzying standard that The Wire had set itself in previous seasons.

It's almost unheard of for television to achieve the artistic integrity of film or literature, and the Wire stands alone as an example of what is possible when a brilliant and passionate writer is allowed to realise his vision unfettered by the commercial constraints imposed by most networks. Let's hope that, once Season 5 (the final season) is over, others will take up the challenge that The Wire has set in creating ground-breaking drama that resonates with us long after the final credits have stopped rolling.",1207699200,3,2792,4.955128205128205

But the ultimate ""showdown"" was not what I expected and was really interesting!  (I won't give it away by saying what happened, but you've got to see this season!)

This show continues to set new standards for writing and capturing the infuriating insanity that defines the American war on drugs.

While the major players of ""The Wire"" are back for a third season, and they all get their fair share of screen time, Season Three is dominated by a new character, Major Howard ""Bunny"" Colvin (Robert Wisdom).  Word has come down from the Mayor's office that Baltimore's crime stats need to drop - fast.  Major Colvin is close to retirement at his full Major's pension after 30 years on the force, and he is sick of the hypocrisy and the wasted effort that causes the war on drugs to go nowhere.

And so he proposes something drastic to restore sanity to Baltimore's streets.  He creates three ""free zones,"" called Amsterdam, where drugs can be bought, sold, and used without police enforcement.  These zones are located in virtually empty blocks - Colvin's thought is that if all the drug trade is there and there is no worry of police, then the dealers and the users will leave the rest of the city alone, and the violent turf wars will stop.

It's no secret that Colvin's efforts will ultimately fail - ""The Wire"" is too smart a show to allow for a simple effort to solve all problems.  But what makes this season so compelling is that we get to see the good and the bad of Colvin's idea . . . as well as the train wreck it becomes when the story goes public.

This season of ""The Wire"" focuses as much on Baltimore's corrupt politics as it does on the streets.  Look for plenty of riveting scenes and lots of ""inside baseball"" as politicos jockey for headlines while protecting their behinds.

But also look for lots of development of the long-time cast of ""The Wire"" as relationships grow and deepen.  Also look for shocking developments with the Barksdale crew, including what happens when McNulty investigates D'Angelo Barksdale's ""suicide.""  Audience favorites Omar, Bubbles, and Brother Mouzone also feature prominently, as does a newcomer, Dennis ""Cutty"" Wise, a former ""soldier"" who gets released from prison.

There has never been a better-acted or better-written show on TV.  Given what HBO has done recently, with ""The Sopranos,"" ""Rome,"" and ""Deadwood,"" that's saying a lot.",1197590400,,2419,4.834951456310679

The creator of The Wire, David Simon, set out to create an epic account of the decline of an empire, and no one who has watched any of the four seasons can doubt the success of his project.  Whether his prognosis is correct remains to be seen, but his diagnosis of the state of the various institutions is certainly convincing.  I have evangelized for The Wire among my children, my extended family, and my friends; all are hooked.  The humanity, the bleakness, and the corruption are presented convincingly and entertainingly.  There isn't a good guy without feet of clay; there almost isn't a villain without a touch of sympathy.",1192924800,,819,5.848739495798319

To all those that complain that TV is whitebreadland, check this series out. A host of African American actors turn in top-notch performances from the Cheif of Police right down to drug dealers. Idris Elba's portrayal of Stringer Bell is outstanding along with the rest of the cast. TV drama just doesn't get any better than this.",1192752000,,543,4.787234042553192
2590241,5,B000FTCLSU,"If you've made it to reading about the third season of The Wire, there's no shortage of the amount of praise you've heard, so let me start with something I didn't love about season 3.  Trying to create a theme this season about politics, season 3 spends a great deal of time on a plotline about Councilman Carcetti, played dutifully by Aidan Gillen, and his seething need to be mayor.  I have to admit that as a rod for the season, I didn't care about it that much - his campaign manager, played by Brandy Burre, is also a rather uninteresting character, or perhaps, I'm forced to admit, that Burre is the first actor hired onto The Wire to be beneath her part.

I start with the way it doesn't work because while it's going on, you're treated to some of the most astonishing television ever created (there's that praise again), and to say that eventually, Carcetti's plotline joins the fold and gets interesting.  It joins the fold through a different rod of the season - Mjr Colvin, embodied with fierce drive by Robert Wisdom, who decides to conquer the Baltimore drug problem, in a way, by moving it - he drives the dealers we've come to be familiar with and some others into a ""free zone"" where drugs can be legalized, an idea that works to an extent, but one that no one can talk about without destroying the world around them.  It's that ""talk"" that the season is really about - that is to say, the politics, from the top down.  Beyond Carcetti's literal politics and Colvin's political maneuvering within the police department, there's the internal politics of the drug world - of our familiar faces of Barksdale (Wood Harris) and Stringer Bell (Idris Elba) competing in their own way for the heart of what it means to be gangsters - is it blood or business that keeps them all going?  The combination of the drug world and the political world - and that includes our always-central crew of detectives, each of whom go through their own political and personal disaster or two in the course of the year - is what makes The Wire so free of easy answers, and so impossible to shake.

There are two scenes that, I think, embody what the show succeeds at so well this season - in the first, late in ""Time After Time,"" the season premiere, Colvin cruises his police car around his filth and crime-ridden West Baltimore streets.  He stops as a young boy tries to sell him crack.  Colvin pulls out his badge, his hat, etc., and with each step, the boy is completely unthwarted in his attempt.  We think, not knowing Colvin, that we're about to see a cop crusing for addictions of his own, but we see the opposite - the heartbreak of the streets on those that want to do good, and the total irrelevance of police in stopping it.  The scene crushes expectations nearly as quickly as it does your heart.

And the second?  The second scene that blew my mind is the one that taught me that Idris Elba, sitting under our nose as Stringer Bell for so long, could be one of the great actors of his generation.  During ""Homecoming"" he's having dinner with Donette (Shamyl Brown), D'Angelo Barksdale's lonely widow, when Stringer snaps at her about telling D'Angelo's mother that D's murder may have been a murder.  Stringer is the drive of all the season's best drama, but it's at the point he yells at her, revealing the gangster under the chilly pose, that we realize, fully, just who he is.  Where it goes from there during the remainder of the season is pure business on this show - as cynical as it is daring, as fearless as it is inevitable.  To watch Elba's work this season is to see the capabilities on a television show that holds its audience's intelligence at a premium, and does it by fulfilling its own storytelling capabilities.  What happens this season changes everything we've seen on The Wire up to this point - its finale, ""Mission Accomplished,"" ties up so many loose ends,  its hardly a surprise that we even see a ""Reelect Frank Sabotka"" poster in its final minutes - that you're shocked at just what dramatic power it retains.",1192233600,,4041,4.539944903581267

2590245,5,B000FTCLSU,"I was feeling pretty down on television in general and had pretty much renounced it until i was sucked into the 4th season of ""The Wire"", the most sincere piece of work I have ever seen put onto film.  It was the only thing that has come close to bringing me to tears in a long while, and that was before I had the pleasure of viewing the previous three seasons.  Of course i bought them immediately and was utterly destroyed by the whole magnitude and genius of the thing.  Added is the fact that it must be the most overlooked show in the history of television, which is both a crime and somewhat of a relief, as I hate hype(the sopranoes).
Every single season is brilliant, and it seems to just keep getting better and better.  Honestly, the first season, while heartwrenching, is probably my least favorite, just because the subsequent three are the best things I've ever seen.  Season by season, the writing has matured into something of it's own, untouchable by any other novel or tv show.  every single utterance seems to be absolutely integral to the bigger picture and almost always results in reciprocation and consequences.
The acting is probably my favorite part of the show, as these actors and actresses are almost all unknown in mainstream media, making their characters so believable it's frightening(Idris Elba, Jamie Hector, John Doman, Michael K. Williams, etc.).  There isn't a single bad performance here.  If I ever saw Jamie Hector on the street I'd probably pass out with fear. This review is really for the show in it's entirety but the 3rd season is where it reaches its pinnacle, and yet keeps getting better and better.  But for the total experiece, start with season one, as many things will be lost on viewers who start later in the storyline.  If you appreciate anything that involves sincerity and doesn't pull punches,watch this show.  But beware, once you watch it it will stick with you for a long time.",1186185600,2,1938,4.704142011834319
2590246,5,B000FTCLSU,Really cool. It seems a lot of seasons' 1 & 2 were spent setting up for 3. I enjoyed it a lot. The Wire has replaced The Sopranos as my number one program. This would have been the case even if The Sopranos continued to run. Can't wait for more.,1184976000,,245,3.92
2590247,5,B000FTCLSU,"I don't have much to say beyond what the many other reviewers have said about this terrific show. I truly think it is in a class by itself, though I have been consistently impresseed with HBO's programming. It's not a show that is fun to watch with other people while drinking/ having side conversations. Not that shows like that are bad, but The Wire is best watched alone, starting with season one episode one.

I like all the seasones of this show but season three ratchets up the intensity another notch. The conflicted relationship between Stringer Bell (my favorite character ever) and Avon is just brilliant. The ending montage gets me everytime. When Avon looks back at the courtroom looking for Stringer his facial expressions say everything.  If you've seen the end of Season Three watch episode one of season one and the last episode of season one. D'Angelo (in episode 1) and Avon (In the finale) look behind them at the courtroom audience and Stringer is there in the back both times.

The lyrics also fit Avon's situation perfectly.

This show is genius. It is highly critical of most every institution it analyzes yet doesnt jam anything down your throat. Its also pretty tragic overall so if you're looking for happy endings, you should still watch this show but be prepared.",1181865600,3,1291,4.801801801801802
2590248,5,B000FTCLSU,"In Season 3 of David Simon's groundbreaking series, Lt. Daniels' Major Crimes Unit has turned its attention back on Westside drug dealers.  Ultimately, as in Season 1, the targets are the drug kingpins Avon Barksdale and Stringer Bell.

But while in Season 1 and 2 the police were the clear heroes of the show (if notoriously flawed and human), in Season 3 The Wire's subtle critique of the drug war becomes a more significant theme.  The police-work conducted by McNulty, Greggs, Daniels, and Freeman remains exciting and heroic, but their efforts are now on the margins of the true movement and import of the story.  When Barksdale is finally busted, it is not so much the result of their police-work as the anonynmous tip of Stringer Bell.  Bell (an charismatic and compelling character in his own right, who continues to grow in Season 3) has become increasingly disenchanted with ""the game"", and reaches out to ""Bunny"" Colvin of the Western with information on Avon.  In the end it is questionable whether Major Crimes has accomplished anything, or whether it was the relationships with actual people forged by Colvin's humanity that actually made a positive difference.

Major ""Bunny"" Colvin of the Western District has become sick of the drug war--convinced that the tactics employed do not constitute real police work.  So he starts pushing all drug trafficing in his district into 3 zones where drug dealing is more or less legalized.  In the meantime, he hides this strategy from his bosses, while his friend ""The Deacon"" begins organizing outreach and condom/needle distribution among the addicts who begin gathering in these districts and no longer have to hide.  ""The Game"" gradually becomes gutted from the inside out, as the violence associated with drug dealing is no longer necessary.  When murders or thefts among the dealers occur, the dealers themselves begin turning to the police for protection--building relationships and passing information.  Utimately even the ruthless Stringer Bell begins to trust Colvin and prefers Colvin's experiment to the destructive reality of grinding on the street.  In the end, Colvin's story asks vital questions as to what police work is all about, and how the police can best protect and serve.

But what lifts Season 3 of The Wire above all television that has come before it is the story of Dennis ""Cutty"" Wise, which features in every single episode.  Cutty is a convicted felon who is released from prison after 14 years...estranged from his family and all meaningful ties to the community.....as well as to himself.  Indeed the only people who are initially prepared to reach out to him are Avon and his crew, who respect Cutty's legendary reputation in ""the game"".  Cutty's journey takes him to the street, back into the game, back out, and ultimately upon a path to redemption, upon which he must ""travel from A to B all by myself"".  I don't want to ruin the story for you--I'll only say that his struggle to find meaning and purpose in the midst of the urban nightmare is nothing less than sublime.  His conversations with such awesome characters as Bodie, Slim Charles, Avon, The Deacon, and other denizons of the urban landscape are conducted in a Baltimore street slang that Simon renders into Shakesphearean poetry, whose final object is not merely extraordinary realism but striving towards a vision of redemption.  It is the sort of timeless art that just gets better with repeat viewings.

If you are new to The Wire, start with Season 1, episode 1-3.  Give yourself a chance to get used to the language, the realism, the all-to-human characters.  And be prepared for the story to keep getting better and better.",1181088000,20,3683,4.972267536704731

2590256,5,B000FTCLSU,"For those who weren't put off by The Wire's unflinching depictions of violence, drug use, profanity, and urban decay, the show takes a new and frightening direction in season three.  Yes, the first two seasons of The Wire dealt with some heavy subject matter, but some of the content of this season may be dark and depressing enough to make even the show's most loyal and unflappable viewers turn away in horror.  Yes, season three of The Wire sees the best show of all time venturing into the corrupt, depraved arena of politics, and once you go down that road you never come back.  For the first time, fans of the show get a look at those roaming the halls of power not just in the Baltimore Police Department (though there is a great deal of that) but of the city itself.  What goes on in the mayor's office, the City Council chamber, and the police headquarters isn't always a pretty picture--even the drug game seems to have more room for loyalty and honor than the political game--but the show's newfound emphasis on political maneuvering does contribute to its evolution from a crime drama with elements of social commentary to a full-fledged urban drama with (according to David Simon) heavy inspiration in Greek tragedy.  And we should all be grateful for it, as it helps further The Wire's claim as the most relevant and challenging show yet to hit TV.  I don't vote and tend to wonder why so many people concern themselves with politics, but The Wire approaches the subject with such a personal and philosophical emphasis that even the most apolitical viewer should be riveted.

Of course, it's not all politics, as pretty much every character viewers know and love from season one is still in play, and there's plenty of violent action and intricate electronic investigating to be found.  After shifting focus for a season to examine crime along East Baltimore's docks, The Wire in season three finds the Major Crimes Unit once again pursuing the drug empire of Avon Barksdale and Stringer Bell, whose damaging bust at the end of season one has left them even more cautious and (in the case of Stringer) looking to make some inroads into legitimate business.  Stringer isn't the only one looking to make some changes either, as season three's predominant theme is the idea of reform, whether it be personal or political, in the ghettoes or in the city government.  Naturally, as experienced viewers might expect, reform in the morally ambiguous world of The Wire is a tricky concept, often temporary or illusory, much talked about but difficult to actually attain.  Not to mention, all talk of reform aside, Baltimore is still a dangerous place, with cops, fueding drug crews, and freelance criminals thrown together in a limited space with a set of shifting agendas and alliances that practically guarantees they'll come into conflict.

Season three introduces several key new characters, all of whom are seamlessly integrated into The Wire's ever-expanding universe--Tommy Carcetti (Aiden Gillen), a calculating city councilman whose occasional idealism does little to temper his ambitions; Dennis ""Cutty"" Wise (Chad L. Coleman), a newly-freed ex-con trying with mixed success to go straight; Marlo Stanfield (Jamie Hector), an almost cartoonishly evil drug dealer who decides to take on the Barksdale empire; and Maj. Howard ""Bunny"" Colvin (Robert Wisdom), the Western district commander who decides to try a decidedly unconventional and controversial approach to prevent his command from being overrun by drug dealers.  The infusion of new blood helps bring The Wire's ""visual novel"" approach to its fullest fruition yet, with the show juggling a huge (and brilliantly portrayed) cast of characters and multiple intersecting plot strands, many of which build on the events of the preceding two seasons.  The Wire may be the best example yet of why cable is the home to such a disproportionate share of TV's most highly regarded shows--only on a network like HBO, where a show's creators are allowed to plan for the long term, would a show with The Wire's level of future orientation be able to survive.  Even in season three, we're still seeing the payoff of plot elements that were introduced in the first two seasons, thanks to Simon and co.'s unbelievably meticulous and deliberate plotting.  Everything that happens has its purpose, even if it's not always apparent right away, and the  fierce intelligence and complexity of the writing is bolstered by the ingenious use of crime novelists to author several of the episodes.  The attention to detail is way beyond anything else I've seen on TV; there's just so much going on in these episodes it defies easy summation.  Even with the expanding cast, the characters are kept multifaceted and relatable, and more than ever before the show elevates conversation to high art, with dialogue laden with authenticity and humor througout--be it the relentlessly inventive and colorful slang of street criminals, the slick pandering of politicians, or the world-weary philosophizing of seasoned cops.

At all times, maximum belivability is the objective, making this season, even more so than the first two, into a microcosm of the world at large.  Whatever your stance on the more politically provocative aspects of this season, the writers almost make it difficult to condone or condemn anyone too vociferously because the reasons for their actions are always thoroughly explored and explained.  The Wire has been described from its beginning as an examination of the effects of institutions on individuals, and Bunny Colvin's plan for dealing with the war on drugs through a policy of accomodation that borders on outright legalization allows the show to broaden and intensify its gaze to illustrate why such a bold idea will never be allowed to take hold in a major American city.  As is generally the case, especially with the War on Drugs, innovation and rationality are inevitably suppressed by an entrenched and inflexible bureaucracy for a simple reason--too many people have a stake in preserving the status quo.  Colvin's idea may be a good one-and to its great credit, the show lets us see both its positive and negative aspects-but it's far too dangerous to those in power to be allowed to proceed.

Still, while it may not always be an easy show to watch, and it doesn't offer much in the way of happy endings, in this reviewer's opinion The Wire still represents the very best American TV has to offer.  Even the best shows I've seen-The Shield, The Sopranos, The Simpsons-have shown some chinks in their armor over the years, but The Wire consistently holds up to analysis, even when I've started proactively looking for flaws while watching.  The recent fourth season took the show in even more new thematic directions, with a great deal of success, but I think this season establishes the best balance between The Wire's crime-drama origins and its increasingly ambitious current incarnation.  Of course, the forthcoming fifth (and supposedly final season) could end up rendering the discussion of the show's best season irrelevant.  Loyal viewers should already be getting all tingly at the thought.",1177718400,22,7179,5.039695945945946

The actors are great and real. They make this series a blockbuster. The Wire should get more credit than they do.

I was hooked as soon as I saw the first episode from the first season. I hope there are many more seasons for the WIRE. I have the first three seasons on DVD and every single one leaves you wanting more. AWESOME SERIES... A MUST BUY!!!",1173571200,,518,4.128712871287129
2590272,5,B000FTCLSU,"One of the best series on TV.  Runs at least neck and neck, I think better then the Sopranos.

The characters are fascinating and complex.  Some of the best story telling and acting I've seen in a long time.  The characters personalities are compelling and captivating.  You just get hooked.

I was a Soprano's snob.  I just felt it was the best thing on TV and safely tucked away in Jersey so I didn't have to think about the crimes affecting my life.

Before I viewed The Wire, I guess I didn't want to be bothered with the whole urban crime thing, especially so close to home.  I felt like what on earth could these kids, with pants hanging down to there knees and rap music blasting have to say that's intelligent?

I found that the crime hierarchy is so much like the Sopranos, organized to the point of being genius.  I found just like the Sopranos there is a Family like element, but a brutality that is unbelievable.

There are characters you will love but know they are paid to kill.  Characters you find ultimately ruthless almost with animal cunning.  Then you will find some characters eloquent in there lifestyle and speech.

Among the characters in Season one, a young dealer who lives in a condemned building with about 6 little elementary school kids.  He buys food for them and sends them off to school.  He's lost with no parents like those kids.  The show isn't preachy in any way.  It just is.

Also The Wire is about both sides of the coin.  The police officers, politics, and lifestyles are just as riveting.  Cops that drink too much, have an awful family life, fighting with ex's, or not giving a damn.
The THIRD SEASON of THE WIRE is no exception.  It's outstanding, a pot boiling over......

I think it's not as popular as the Sopranos because there aren't a lot of big time stars in it although there are local actors and cameos by some well known artists.
Please take a look at this outstanding series; you'll be glad you did.",1173312000,,1954,4.485795454545454

2590274,5,B000FTCLSU,"...if you keep your mind open.  many people see this series as too slow moving and/or oblique to get into.  their loss!  it is an excellent, realistic-as-possible portrayal of the urban wastelands of the USA (though it takes place in Baltimore, the same issues exist the nation over.)  i absolutely love the actors  and characters in this show!  McNulty continues his rebellious attempts to stir things up within CID, stepping on toes as usual and paving the way for a new, unprecedented witchhunt.  Meanwhile, Stringer and Avon drift apart.  Stringer's ambitions of leaving behind the war pitfalls of the game don't sit well with Avon, who embodies the warrior's code, especially given the threat from upstart rival Marlo.  Colvin attempts a disastrous (politically) attempt at legalization of street narcotics amidst pressure from his superiors in the Dep't.  Cutty, one of the feared street soldiers of the past, returns from prison to find that he isn't the man he once was.  The political arena is also introduced here, with the sly, double-dealing would-be mayor Carcetti, and the Sleaze King Incumbent Mayor Royce (a friend of the odious Clay Davis from previous seasons).  Oh, and Omar and Mouzone seem to have a Beretta named vendetta.  All of these plotlines come to a head like never before at the end in an earth-shaking climax that has tremednous implications for the future of the show.  This shows creators liken it to a greek tragedy-the comparison is apt in only the most positive of ways.  Watch and be mesmerized by one of the finest creations in modern television.

2590284,5,B000FTCLSU,"For any that don't know, the Wire is the most intelligent show on TV.  On its surface, this is a cop show set in Baltimore, but in reality The Wire is a meditation on our crumbling urban society, corrupt bureacracies & the men and women on all sides of the 'drug war' that are trying to survive and make some sense of it all.

For those already hooked on the show, season three concentrates back on the Barksdale crew and hones in on one Baltimore PD precinct captain who is fed up with the failed drug war and decides to take matters into his own hands.",1168473600,,554,4.216981132075472
2590285,5,B000FTCLSU,"The third season of the Wire maintains the consistently high quality of the previous series. It is perhaps the best portrayal of office politics on television. The fact that the two businesses in competition are police and drug dealers is ironic, but it does not detract from the recognisability of the situations the characters face - pressures for sales and results from often venial managers more concerned with their own comfort and careers than the consequences of their decisions. In this the Wire insists on treating all the characters, cops, drug dealers, murderers and politicians as human beings, rather than as two-dimensional heroes and villians.

Further the complexity and challenges of policing are detailed in compelling fashion and it never pretends there are easy answers to the problems posed by drugs and poverty in depressed inner cities.

If this gives the impression of staid worthiness then forgive me: the show is also exciting, sexy and often very funny. Brilliant, masterful writing realised as outstanding television.",1168387200,5,1045,5.327272727272727
2590286,5,B000FTCLSU,"For the first two seasons, ""The Wire"" came off as a good, smart cop show. While the freedom of HBO opened some new possibilities that aren't available on network TV, aside from a few details such as the split cop/crook perspective, it didn't seem fundamentally different from ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" in a lot of ways.

  This season changed all that. For the first two seasons, The Wire gave a dichotomy between both the cops fighting the war on drugs street-level, and the dealers that they worked to catch.

  In this season, the show broadened out even further into many different areas- More focus on the top brass at the police department, the Mayor's office. More than ever before, the Wire became less of a cop show, and more a study of an entire city, and of how different institutions and groups affect one another. It has more scope, more ambition and more balls to tell the truth than any other TV show I can think of.

  The Wire Season III is a sprawling, 12-hour televised novel. Seen in individual episodes, it could get confusing- missing a single show could throw you off, and starting halfway through could make it very hard to follow. But it makes for excellent viewing as a box set, and its the kind of DVD you can feel proud to own.",1168041600,4,1260,4.515418502202643
2590287,5,B000FTCLSU,"The Wire is simply the best thing on TV period.  You need to have seen seasons one and two to follow the storyline as it is complex and includes many regular characters.

The extras are the usual commentaries, etc.  There is one  Q & A session with the writers and actors on the show which is very interesting for fans of the show.  If you want shoot-outs and melodrama this is not the show for you.  This is a cerebral police show which includes numerous aspects of Baltimore around the central police story.

And that is exactly why it is compelling.  Once you get into the swim of the story you can't look away.  It's unlike anything I've ever seen.  It tackles all the issues that contribute to urban blight: politics, education, crime and interweaves the stories in a way that you start to 'get' the whole tapestry.  There are no saccharine (sp?) moral victories here.  The people we come to care about are in their own swim and are powerless to combat the forces sweeping them along.

I'm sure Jeffrey Lorenzo (whom Amazon is listing as the lead star currently) is fantastic, but I DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS!  Similarly with the entire cast they list... What is up with this?",1166054400,,385,4.96875
2590295,5,B000FTCLSU,"I have never written a review for anything purchased on Amazon.  However, upon finishing the forth season of The Wire and being a devoted fan of this show since the first season, it is this show that has compelled me to write a review.  Part of the reason is clearly to join in the fun with those whose complete devotion and love for this show is obvious.  Part of it is to help promote a show that lacks in ratings due primarily to the expectations they have of their audience.

But the real reason I am writing this is in the complete off-chance that David Simon cruises Amazon ratings, reads this and listen to me BEGGING HIM to find a way to make this series last beyond a fifth season.

Anyhow- on to the review.  With little doubt, The Wire will take its place among **the world's** greatest fiction ever created.  The Wire deserves a place on the same shelf has Homer's epics, Chaucer's tales and Shakespeare's plays.  My sense is that most who have left their feedback here would not disagree.

The characters in this drama live and work within very real instituations that all of us do.  They work in and around the system to the best of their abilities.  These characters live within organizations that have goals, metrics and lives of their owns that overshadow the individuals that comprise them.  The people are flawed in real and human ways. But every day, they go to work- whether that work happens to fall on one side of the law.

Each scene, each line of dialogue, each camera shot has been deliberately considered.  It is completely evident that David Simon, et.al. are primarily focused on the story.  It's not about what the audience wants or expects.  Of course the situations have been constructed to create a textured, intricate fabric, but the character respond with sincerity to their predicaments.

For those who are not initiated into The Wire- like others, I highly recommend starting with Season 1. Some suggest that it is necessary for future seasons.  I actually disagree with this.  While you will certainly miss some of the nuance in subsequent seasons, it is possible to watch the seasons out of order.

However, the big challenge with this work of fiction is that each subsequent season only becomes more complex than the one before it.  Watching season 1 is in many ways the best way to ""dip your toes"" into the water as it (surprisingly!) is the least complex of the 4 seasons.  Furthermore, I am going to depart again from my friends, and suggest that the second season is also fairly critical as it establishes a few characters that become key players in later seasons (eg Prop Joe, the Greeks- who I actually suspect will become quite important in Season 5 what with Marlo being introduced to them).  But beyond that, I actually thought Season 2 was quite good on its own.. but sure- certainly not as critical in the story of the Barksdales.

For those who have seen the forth season, it is nothing short of spectacular.  I find myself to have an empty space in my heart now with nothing more left for the season and salivating for the fifth and final one to return.

To the uninitiated, who crave beautifully constructed, flawlessly executed and frighteningly addicting works of fiction... this is masterful literature for our generation.",1165795200,7,3279,4.69877408056042
2590296,5,B000FTCLSU,The third season of The Wire is at least as good as the first two. What a pity we don't have TV of this quality in the UK. But DVDs and Amazon mean that we can watch it anyway. Eat your heart out British Broadcasting Corp!,1163548800,3,222,3.847826086956522
2590297,5,B000FTCLSU,It's all been said in virtually every other review.

2590298,5,B000FTCLSU,"People who have seen the previous two seasons of The Wire will agree that the show ""cruises"" into Season 3.

One of the great things about this show is the continuity of characters and story threads through the whole show.  The Wire doesn't jump out of the TV set and slap you in the face like many current shows (there is nothing wrong with that), it simply surrounds you.  By the end of the season you are intimately familiar with each character and fully understand the story content.  Season 3 gives us surprising, no, shocking confirmation of how today's criminals have the upper hand (in law) and shows the lengths to which the enforcers of our laws have to go to try to bring the criminals to justice.  The usual ""untouchables"" return this season to peddle their wares but this time, one senior police officer has a unusual (illegal?) method of controlling them and thus cleaning up the streets.  Of course, McNulty & friends are on the periphery with their wire taps of the main ""players"" and stumble upon the ""controlled zone"" and have to face the dilemma of fingering a friend or helping.

Is this reality?  Who knows ... I hope not!  Does it feel real with (in my view) Award-Winning performances from both ""cop"" & ""criminal""?  Well...I recommend that you make your own judgement - why don't you buy a copy & decide for yourself.",1163116800,2,1340,4.616033755274262

At a minimum, the reasonably bright should have no problem connecting the scattered dots The Wire's creators masterfully placed for viewers.

2590306,5,B000FTCLSU,"I hesitate to try to typify THE WIRE in a wee Amazon review, as the show's extraordinary realism and excellence are reflected in so many different components, it would take a feature article to do it justice. For example, this crime program is populated by police officers and criminals who are in many cases, the ""genuine article,"" and there is no obvious difference between these real-deal folks and the show's ACTUAL actors. Thus, we can score one for verisimilitude.  (Actually, score two.)

I'd also like to point out that if you're a fan of this show and you haven't read teleplay writer and novelist George Pelecanos's work yet, get to it.

It concerns a black detective, talking with the street hoodlum ""Omar"" about the way the neighborhood used to be, and he says, ""you know, no matter how hard people were, there was no such thing as a person that got killed and didn't matter"". That scene is a great statement and commentary on American inner cities and what has happened to them. You can see that Omar is trying to ""blow it off"" and be tough, but in his eyes, you can see that those words have struck him to his core. The scene is one of the best in the entire series and indicative of how good this series is. The writing is absolutely spectacular. It blows me away how good this show is.",1160697600,6,773,4.125827814569536
2590308,5,B000FTCLSU,"Simply put, ""The Wire"" is the best series on TV, bar none. Individuals weaned on network programming may have a difficult time getting into this series because the story takes time to unfold, spans the entire season--segments are not neatly tied up--and because the writers treat the viewers as though they are intelligent. (I recently purchased Season One of the widely acclaimed ""24."" It turned out to be everything ""The Wire"" is not: artificial, contrived, shallow, and an insult to one's intelligence.)

Filmed on location on Baltimore's mean streets, ""The Wire"" is driven by a rich cast of well-developed, complex, believable characters--politicians, cops, drug lords, street hustlers.  The casting is perfect and the acting some of the best you will see on TV.  I came away from this series feeling that it, more than any other TV programming that I had seen, portrayed both the street drug culture and the war on drugs--especially national, local, and police politics--as it really is.

By the end of Season One, the main character, detective Jimmy McNulty, has run afoul of his superiors, and he is banished from working to bring down the Barksdale drug organization to the Baltimore PD's harbor patrol. This sets the stage for Season Two, which unfolds in the harbor setting and represents a distinct departure from the story line of Season One. Season Two ends with McNulty winning his way back onto the task force targeting Barksdale, setting the stage for Season Three. Thus, Season Three could be considered a continuation of Season One, with Season Two standing on its own. I watched the three seasons in sequence because (then) I had no choice. But if I had access to all three seasons, I'd have been sorely tempted to have gone from Season One to Season Three in my desire to see how the Barksdale story line played out. Then I'd have watched Season Two. This in no way is to meant to knock Season Two--it, too, is excellent--it is simply a reflection of how deeply Season One draws you into its story.  Does Season Three meet the high expectations set by Season One? It exceeded my expectations, and Season Three stands as my favorite of the three. Watch the first season and you will want to own all three (soon four) seasons.",1159920000,5,2244,4.833333333333333
2590309,4,B000FTCLSU,"I'd love to delve into all of the facets of ""The Wire,"" but there just isn't enough space.

What I can say is thank Jeebus that it's coming back for another season (just heard about its renewal for a fifth and, I believe, final season).

To try and encapsulate what the third season is about really will not do it justice, but the focus is certainly back on the streets. Avon Barksdale, having schemed his way into an early release from Jessup Correctional, is coming back home, where his right-hand man, the magnetic, engaging Stringer Bell, has been running so serious a business that he can buy legit cribs for himself and Avon; in fact, one of the beauty moments in this season is seeing Stringer's business-man persona put in check when he tries his hand at political persuasion.

The central struggle, as usual, is the drug trade: mandates are coming from the department to reduce crime OR ELSE. One particularly affecting scene is watching the mayor and police commissioner debate, almost glibly, about how many homicides it will take before the two experience political fallout (""300 is too many... now, if you can do 275...? That's something we can live with.""). You could tell this season that politics and political figures are going to have a much bigger role in future episodes. The cutthroat race for mayor, I think, is really going to heat up in the next season.

And it's no fair to spill the biggest surprise of the season, even though it's just a one-second shot of Captain Rawls. Can't WAIT to see what they do with THAT in the fourth season.

I'm not sure if there's any way a police commander could get away with what Maj. Bunnie Colvin tries to get away with in this season, but it's certainly an interesting take on fighting the violence that often accompanies the drug war.

Add in a healthy dose of my main man Omar, turf beef with a young up-and-comer in the drug trade and the death of a character who will be universally missed, and you have another volatile, staggeringly earnest portrayal of class conflict, the war on drugs and, in creator David Simon's words, 'the America that America doesn't need.'

HBO may charge two arms and a leg for their series (personally, I prefer to rent 'em on Netflix), but if one is worth it, it's ""The Wire.""",1159488000,4,2272,4.622828784119107

2590312,5,B000FTCLSU,"I'm writing this on a Monday morning, having just finished a weekend-long marathon viewing of Season 3 with my wife to prepare for Season 4. This tells you two things about ""The Wire"":

1. **You need to pay attention.** That's a scarce commodity these days - which is why the show will never be as big a ratings hit as it deserves. And I'm sure I'll lose this product more sales than I gain when I boast how a critical plot development in Season 3 will make little sense if you didn't watch Season 1. [Or at least carefully read the episode summaries on HBO's web site.] But that's the kind of show it is - where you learn a very surprising (and telling) fact about one of the two dozen or so major supporting characters by a wordless two-second shot at the end of a scene that was about a different sub-plot entirely. Also: the thick street accents and liberal use of gangsta and police slang will probably have you hitting the Rewind button on your DVD remote more than once.

2. **You will enjoy paying attention.** [I'll bet that no one would be willing to watch 12 episodes of, say, ""Without A Trace"" in three days.] Although its fellow HBO show ""Deadwood"" is the one noted for the savory richness of its dialogue, one could argue that ""The Wire"" is equally eloquent - though unprintable - while being a little less precious about it. Just about every episode has at least one speech so strong that it will echo in your mind long after the hour is over. And the acting is equally and uniformly splendid, fully inhabiting three-dimensional characters who make almost impossible a facile assortment into ""good"" and ""bad"" columns.",1159142400,14,1632,4.5476190476190474
2590313,5,B000FTCLSU,"This is without question the best show on television, hands down.  It's beyond me why so many people gravitate to HBO's other shows and overlook this gem.  Don't make the same mistake!",1157846400,4,184,4.71875
2590314,5,B000FTCLSU,"The Wire has made me laugh harder, cry harder, and think harder than anything else I've sever seen or read.

No other movie or TV show even begins to approach the dramatic scope of this show. The divisions between episodes and seasons are merely logistic - it's all continuous - a brilliantly conceived drama of epic, Shakespearian proportions.

Season 1 was so powerful unto itself, and yet now we see that every scene in it was critical to the next two seasons.

For example, the character of Brianna, D'Angelo's mother, appears briefly in each  season, but everything she does and says is pivotally important. When she and McNulty come face to face in Season III it's so powerful that it's like getting slugged in the stomach - and this sets up an even more devastating scene between Stringer and Avon, and yet another between Stringer, Avon and Brianna. The honesty and power of the acting is astounding.

If The Wire has lower ratings than lesser shows such as The Sopranos, it's because it's so meticulous in avoiding any type of sensationalism, clich, or predictability. The first 3 episodes of each season are slow and full of details, but if you watch them several times, they set you up later for the type of emotional payoff that you will simply not find elsewhere.",1157068800,6,1276,4.72972972972973
2590315,5,B000FTCLSU,"That's the massive payoff in the third season here, a real look at what we would see around us were we to abandon the ""war on drugs"" ... the good, bad, and ugly of it.

This has been the best show on TV for a while.  It's a slightly difficult view because each episode is like a chapter is a novel, without introduction at the start and climax near the end.  Anyone who sticks with it, who undertakes the reading of the entire book, is rewarded massively.  I'm convinced it's the best drama television has seen to date.

Superlatives fail to describe the excellence of this series.  If you enjoy the degree of realism in ""The Sopranos"", ""Six Feet Under"", or ""The Shield"" - three other shows that have aspired to a high level of realism and sophistication - check this out.",1157068800,5,772,4.401408450704225
2590316,5,B000FTCLSU,"After a virtuosic first season and an ambitious (but not quite as thrilling) second season, The Wire's third season proved to be the best one yet. Even though it hasn't been embraced by the public at large (like, say, The Sopranos), the show has received gobs of critical acclaim and delivers the goods, too, every week. I think that not only is The Wire a better show than The Sopranos (which is, admittedly, a truism), but it is a show which better reflects our post-9/11 mindset than its erstwhile New Jersey neighbor. The Sopranos is a product of another time, the zeitgeist of the late 1990s, with its constant putdowns of moneyed, whining, shrink-visiting, latte-sipping, politically-correct hipsters (the Eagles song ""Get Over It"" being perhaps the definitive cultural manifesto of the time). That show produced three excellent seasons of TV, but then 9/11 changed the world and Tony, Paulie, et al, never managed to get back ahead of the curve. The Wire was formed in direct response to 9/11 and links the drug war to the War on Terror, in both a direct and indirect sense, while examining the institutions (both legitimate and seamy) and the individuals that inhabit them. Although the show is described (even by itself) with such terms as ""gritty"" and ""unvarnished"", it is actually not so simple--in the show, as in life, few people fall into the sinner and saint categories. Leaders in these institutions are generally rational and even the antagonists occasionally speak uncomfortable truths. The result is a universe in which we find people's character defined not by their social or economic position.

Season 3 builds on the previous seasons and returns to the streets for a showdown between Avon Barksdale's (Wood Harris) crew (still managed, in the interim, by Stringer Bell (Idris Elba)) and a vicious upstart by the name of Marlo, who has taken control of Avon's territory thanks to Stringer's attempts to go straight. On the law side, Kima's (Sonja Sohn) doubts about motherhood continue to grow, while newly-minted Deputy Commissioner Rawls (John Doman) rips district commanders to shreds (and is the subject of a revelation of some interest). At the center of it all is Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West), whose liaison with an elite political consultant leads to some quite surprising conclusions that make you reevaluate the character entirely. The political plotline leads naturally into the new arena the show explores, Baltimore's city politics, which prominently features two figures: Mayor Clarence Royce, who seems like an honest, reasonable man, and City Councilman Tommy Carcetti (Adrien Gillen), whose character flirts the line between raw ambition and occasional idealism. In between these personalities is still-Acting Commissioner Burrell (Frankie Faison), whose previous cock-of-the-walk status gives way to getting chewed out by the Mayor. There are plenty more great storylines: Daniels (Lance Reddick) hooking up with Pearlman (and dealing with his nominal wife), Bunk trying to find a wounded officer's gun, and Major ""Bunny"" Colvin deciding to legalize drugs in condemned areas in order to keep the dealers off the streets. Colvin's plan does reduce crime, and things seem to be getting better, except that the legal drug area (""Hamsterdam"") is a hellhole, and eventually the plan is exposed. This plotline just goes to show how much bigger problems can get if they're ignored. Overall, a spectacular season from a show that exceeds even high expectations.",1156723200,78,3492,5.213523131672598
2590317,5,B000FTCLSU,"No doubt about it: this is the best written, best produced, best acted television show ever made. Each season, ""The Wire"" moves from strength to strength, resulting in a powerful ensemble work in which each character is given their due, and every scene has purpose and dramatic heft.  I'm a fan of a lot of classy shows -- ""Buffy,"" ""Six Feet Under,"" ""Deadwood,"" ""Freaks And Geeks,"" ""Lost,"" ""America's Next Top Model"" -- but none of them has had such a consistent track record.  There hasn't been a slack or weak episode of ""The Wire"" yet, and the show just gets better and better.  Comparing it to ""The Sopranos,"" for example, I'm shocked by how far down Tony and his crew have fallen off my radar... HBO allowed that show to devolve into a sitcom, whereas ""The Wire"" remains a taut, intelligent and richly clever drama... There's humor, too, but this show has real impact and depth.

I'm just bummed I have to wait so long to see Season Four!",1156723200,6,943,4.562130177514793
2590318,5,B000FTCLSU,"I believe those of us who have to wait for the DVD releases of The Wire ( which arrive on HBO's typical tortoise-like schedule) are even more amply rewarded than those who watch it on TV. Watching a season of The Wire on DVD is like spending time reading a good novel, and you can watch it at your own pace . ( In my case, over 2 days)

The Wire is simply one of the best shows on TV. That said, I found season 3 somewhat disappointing in comparison the the brilliant first 2 seasons. The new aspect of Baltimore city life explored in season 3- city government/politics- is not as compelling as the  drug business/police storyline of season 1 and the dockworkers/international gangsters plot of season 2.

The new characters introduced are not as compelling, either. The Bunny Colvin character is  appealing and well-acted, but his storyline is too predictable. The Carcetti character felt like a placeholder, as  his story arc didn't go much of anywhere. He will likely  become more significant in season 4, but too much time was wasted  on setting him up. The ""Cutty"" character's story was just plain boring. I'd  have preferred that  it be cut entirely  in order to expand other elements .

While multiple characters and storylines were ably juggled in season 2, the writers seem  a bit overwhelmed with the new additions. Our old friends from season 1 and 2 get little attention and developments for their characters seem very rushed and  perfunctory ( ""Prez ""'s  in particular) And  is there ever enough Omar?

The main problem with season 3 is that it is less a complete and satisfying season than  a  wrap up  of plotlines from seasons 1 and 2 and setup for season 4.

However, I was still happy to spend 12 hours in this world, and I can't wait to see what happens next.

Watch The Wire, buy the DVDs, keep this great show going.",1156118400,4,1837,4.556574923547401
2590319,5,B000FTCLSU,"It's criminal the amount of people that watch the best drama on television, ""The Wire."" I started watching because of David Simon. The man wrote the book that ultimately became my favorite TV show of all time, ""Homicide: Life on the Street."" I quickly became a huge fan, and theres a number of reasons why.

The writing for ""The Wire"" is nothing short of incredible. It's not written by ""TV Writers"" but more experienced authors and this makes quite a difference. A season of The Wire unfolds like a great novel. As each episode goes by, the greater the story builds. Its full of amazing characters and has many special touches and little nuances that are a joy to watch. The cast is fantastic and all the actors do a wonderful job.

I think what many people tend to miss is the importance of the storylines and the issues that David Simon and his team are addressing. In season 3 the storyline of Major Bunny Colvin ""decriminalising"" drugs in a certain area of his district was an amazing look at the world of crime and drugs. It was such an incredible storyline, because it wasn't black and white. An amazing hypothetical that leaves me thinking to this day.

The Wire is television at its very best, it also demands a lot from the viewer. Its definitely worth repeat viewing of the episodes. If you put the time in to notice the detail of the show it is extremely rewarding. The intricate storylines, complex characters, and revealing insights into life and instituitions are waiting for your viewership. This DVD is a must own.  Season 4 of The Wire premieres in Spetember on HBO.",1155859200,13,1584,4.6063829787234045
2590320,5,B000FTCLSU,"The Wire is by far the best show on HBO. Carnivale is, or should I say was another. Both of these shows do not get the credit they're due. The Sopranos used to be a good show. Now it's just garbage, and the sad thing is that the writer knows that no matter what he puts out, it's still going to beat out shows like the Wire or Carnivale. If you have a job that deals with politics, you will definitely be able to relate to the Wire. Put the stereotype out of your mind that it's just an extended rap video, and watch it. You'll see that you have more in common with the characters than you think. Also check out Carnivale. You'll ask yourself why you haven't been watching these shows all along.",1155600000,3,695,4.155555555555556
2590321,5,B000FTCLSU,"As the third season of HBO's brilliant and innovative the Wire begins, it becomes apparent that the war on drugs in Baltimore is primed to explode.  The previous season, most of the show was focused on events surrounding the docks, but with season three, the series is shifted back to the streets as both sides of the war on drugs escalate to new methods in an effort to eliminate one another, and it's a war that no one is winning.  Avon Barksdale (Wood Harris) is out of jail and looking to reclaim what's his, even if it means going head to head with Stringer Bell (the excellent Idris Elba).  In the meantime, Detective Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West) finds his own life falling to pieces more and more, but it won't stop him from doing what he feels he needs to do.  Featuring a large ensemble cast, all of whom leave a lasting impretion (from Frankie Faison to Lance Reddick), the Wire is one of those rare accomplishments in the world of television that does so much right that it can't be put into words.  The Sopranos and other shows always get the spotlight from the real gems on HBO, and the Wire is one of those shows that deserves much more recognition than it's ever gotten.  If you don't believe that, the proof is right here, and soon enough, the much anticipated fourth season will be premiering, and upon viewing this season, you'll be salivating for it.",1155427200,17,1369,4.522267206477733
2590322,5,B000FTCLSU,"I must say after season 2 where they spent most of their time focusing on the docks, Season 3 crept in and just exploded The Wire right back where Season one left off.

I mean how much more drama can a crime/thriller give than what Season 3 gave us.  I mean I Tivo'd the whole season and still watch the reruns that are currently on.  That's when you know a show is just that good.

And the excitement builds to until the very end and like any good show leaves you feening like a junkie for Season 4.  I'm not going to give you all details of the show but I do have my favorite characters as well.  Stringer was my man for real.  Not only was he smooth as hell, but he just was downright cruddy and dirty.  The elements all bad guys need to have.  Omar, well what can you say, a gangsta with a touch of wit.  You can't buy that kind of script anywhere.  McNulty, well he just basically gives a performance of what real Detectives/Cops are, loyal to no one but themselves and will use any method (legal or illegal, mostly the latter) to get who they are after.  And of course Wood Harris as Avon, I couldn't think of a better person to play AVON.  And the cat who plays Avon's right hand man and head of security detail (Big Slim) is hilarious.

2590323,5,B000FTCLSU,"For a long time nothing could come close to the excellence of HOMICIDE:LIFE ON THE STREETS. That NBC drama was the best police drama on television for many years. Though it faltered in the last few seasons the worst episode was better than the best Law and Order. Nothing on network tv has come close.

Thankfully we are no longer slaves to the whims of the networks. HBO has earned it's rep for great shows and although it isn't the best known, the Sopranos gets that title, in another three or four years, *yawn* it will be back on. While some wait for the next season of the most overrated show on HBO (yeah I said it, the Sopranos is overrated, it bores me) those in the know are eager for the fourth season of HBO's best drama; THE WIRE which starts in Sept, 06.

Season three sees the effects of the Baltimore drug war built to a climax as old cops realize that their lives need more meaning than the next case and old criminals begin to turn on each other.

If you watched the first two seasons you DO NOT want to miss this one. Big changes are in store for both sides of the war on the streets. A Police lieutenant tired of the killing essentially legalizes drugs in his district and guess what? It works!

Stringer Bell tries to go legit but has trouble convincing Avon Barksdale, just back from prison, that the gun should be set aside for the briefcase. Omar is of course, a thorn in the paw for the dealers and the police. Det. Jimmy McNulty is...well, what can you say but he is on the case and all that entails both good and bad.

The ensemble cast is steller, there is not a weak actor in the group and it is tough to say who stand out the most.

8126476,5,B000FTCLSU,"The Wire (2002-2008) is excellent. It paved the way for an even better drug crime show, Breaking Bad (2008-2013).

Most people are aware of corporate espionage and what some companies will do to protect their secrets. In the TV show Breaking Bad the two main characters, Walter White, played by Bryan Cranston, and Jesse Pinkman, played by Aaron Paul, possess the knowledge and skill to produce the best meth on the market. And their brand is easily identifiable by its unique blue color.

Several competing criminal organizations buy their services and try to replicate their product but Whites and Pinkmans skill in the art and science of making their blue meth product isn't easily duplicated. One group tries to hold Pinkman hostage in Mexico because their highly trained scientists cant make meth as well as he does. Near the end of the series another criminal group keeps Pinkman chained in their lab and force him to make meth for them because their guy, who worked with both White and Pinkman, is unable to duplicate Pinkmans and Walter Whites skill in the art and science of making their blue meth brand.

Breaking Bad has one of the best story and character arcs ever used in a TV show, which is why it has an IMDb rating of 9.5, right up there with Game of Thrones, another great show. The Wire (2002-2008) was as good as the Sons of Anarchy (2008-2014), but not as good as Breaking Bad. I won't give away the ending of Breaking Bad, but if you watch the complete series, from the first episode to the last, the ending will make complete sense and be very satisfying. Its terrific.

If the above series don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once: Band of Brothers (2001), Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Black Sails (2014-2017), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lonesome Dove (1989), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.
