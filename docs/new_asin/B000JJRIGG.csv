8150974,3,B000JJRIGG,"This one is not at all what you expect.  It is a sermon with humor in it.  It is good and has a good message, but it isn't his typical routine.  I do recommend it.",1289260800,2,163,3.6
8150975,5,B000JJRIGG,"Ken Davis has the greatest sense of humor and great delivery.  It's like he's not trying to be funny, but he is.  It is a great video.  I have watched it over and over.  And best of all it's good clean humor.  As Red Skelton said, Laughter is medicine and when you put foul language in it you put poison in the medicine.  I love the whole Bananas series.",1202169600,,354,4.057971014492754
