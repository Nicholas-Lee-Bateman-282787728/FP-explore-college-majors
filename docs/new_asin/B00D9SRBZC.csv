Paramount screwed customers with original release of Into Darkness by splitting extras onto several versions available exclusively from different retailers.

5785560,5,B00D9SRBZC,"Love this set. I love how they integrated Spock in them. That was important to making it cohesive with the rest of the shows. These young acters and actresses have done a fine job of portraying their characters,  and with this set and then with star trek beyond its a wonderful trio. I have all three and watched them after watching the 10 disk stardate collection, and it was wonderful.  It flows well, and the characters are fun and I can definitely see them as these young people.  Can't wait for the new series in 2017, and I'm sure star trek will have wonderful movies yet to come. We fans are always in anticipation of them. Definitely recommend this set.",1480982400,,661,4.491666666666666

For a long time Trek fan, the first of the two provides a plausible back story for James T. Kirk...one that you could have only speculated about for the original series.

5785568,5,B00D9SRBZC,"I've been a Star Trek fan since the original series aired and had my doubts about the new cast. What a pleasant surprise to find that this cast, with a few exceptions, does honor to the original bunch. Both movies also answered questions which I never even thought to ask.

Zachary Qunto has a tough act to follow. Leonard Nimoy was my favorite actor in the original cast, but whoever came up with the idea of putting them both on screen in the same flick is a genius who should indeed live long and prosper.

5785590,4,B00D9SRBZC,"Movies are great. Fun reboot of the Star Trek series.

Description is misleading, however, as the characters listed are for Lord of the Rings, not Star Trek. Also, discs appear to be for a region outside the US. Fortunately, they play, so that's good.",1469923200,,251,4.704545454545454

5785592,4,B00D9SRBZC,"Strictly talking about the Bluray quality and not about packaging: Star Trek (The First Movie), well the Bluray is decent, has a little signs of grains but it's acceptable since it's not an IMAX camera shot movie. Star Trek: Into the Darkness: Top notch Video Quality for the IMAX Shot scenes (Thumbs Up). The Special Features are good and that makes this package a worthy buy. If I've to really nitpick then the discs don't have the ability to 'Resume' playback from the last scene that you were watching, you'll always have to move to the scene manually which is a little extra step but that's about it and no other things to complain really. Include HD Digital download, but we all know those suck in quality anyway but just wanted to mention if you care.",1468972800,9,758,4.580882352941177
5785593,5,B00D9SRBZC,"A ""trekkie"" from long ago. I liked the idea of producing new (and improved) movies relating to the original cast of the Enterprise.",1468713600,,131,4.739130434782608
5785594,5,B00D9SRBZC,"I'm not the world's biggest fan of sci-fi, and when I first heard about this reboot I think I probably rolled my eyes. Having watched Heroes, the idea of Zachary Quinto as Spock left me feeling quite the same as Sheldon when he accidentally received the cardboard cutout of said actor instead of Leonard Nimoy on TBBT. OH but did we have to eat crow, all of us naysayers! Not only did Quinto deliver such a stellar performance opposite Nimoy that I can quite understand and imagine a whole generation of Quinto fans as the new Spock. Moreover, the movies delivered the kind of stellar performances, casting and combination of story line and special effects that truly pays tribute to the genius of the late Gene Roddenberry.

As someone who, personally, doesn't enjoy the preponderance of special effects in lieu of a story line, I was absolutely delighted to find myself gripped by these new movies. The casting is perhaps one of the best I've seen in any movie franchise since the Bourne series with Matt Damon - with each actor bringing something unique to the table.

But, more than that, the movies somehow managed to seamlessly blend action, romance, sci-fi and reality, human interactions and space exploration, in such a way that the end result is nothing short of magnificent. I can only hope that the next movie will be every bit as amazing!",1467072000,3,1351,4.74468085106383
5785595,5,B00D9SRBZC,"The most complete of these films, picked this up at Costco the other day on sale for like 15 dollars.

5785599,4,B00D9SRBZC,"Great special effects...decent story lines. As a Star Trek fan dating all the way back to the beginning in 1965, there are several things that don't make sense as prequel but I guess that's today's Hollywood.

5785600,5,B00D9SRBZC,"We've all been disappointed by sequels, prequels and re-makes of legendary classics.  What sets the Star Trek franchises apart is how they never fail to deliver on plot lines that are consistent with their continuous theme; and these movies are no exception.  A true Star Trek fan (one who has seen most or all of the television broadcasts and the theater releases) will definitely appreciate the way elements of these two movies ""connect the dots"" in ways that will make you rave about them when you are done watching!",1463097600,2,519,4.820224719101123

5785607,5,B00D9SRBZC,A part of the reason I invested in a Blu Ray players was that all the good special features seemed to be on the Blu Ray versions. This wasn't the case with the initial Blu Ray releases of Star Trek and Star Trek Into Darkness. Apparently Paramount has been spreading the special features of their films among release versions. I was very happy to find the Compendium collection released by Paramount  on Amazon. The Blu-ray transfer was excellent. Having all the special features for the individual films collected on a separate disc for each film was great. It was an excellent purchase.,1454457600,,588,4.764705882352941
5785608,2,B00D9SRBZC,"The two stars are because the action froze every 30 seconds during ""Into Darkness.""

It has nice clear inserts holding to discs per side but the case doesn't close, it folds together but there is no pinching it together like on most movie cases. Also the inserts are not glued evenly and the outside cover has a cardboard feel to it. The back was originally plain and they hot glued a paper cover to the back trying to make it look like the back of a regular DVD movie case. Overall movies, and price were fantastic and delivery was on time as always. Very disappointed with the lack of effort on the case. The front looks amazing but the rest is disappointing. Would have been an easy 5 star rating.",1443744000,2,755,4.4

Abrams films and also all the deleted scenes,.outtakes, and production specials for both movies 'Star Trek' and 'Into Darkness' all on a 4 disk Blueray collection so all video is crystal clear and worth getting the collection for this alone and then get all the extra material on top of this.  My only complaint might be the physical size of the collection.  From the photo, one might think that this is a fairly large box bit it turns out that the collection is a tiny regular standard Blueray / DVD case and quite small.  The makers arranged the 4 discs so they overlap and you have to take out disk 1 and 2 out of the case in order to remove the bonus discs which is a little bit of a mild annoyance but nothing major.  It does allow them to shrink the size of the set.",1441152000,2,915,4.265895953757226

5785626,3,B00D9SRBZC,"First of all, I wasn't too happy with the packaging.  The disc trays were so poorly designed that I couldn't figure out how to remove the bonus discs without damaging them.  So, this review is for the movies only.

When I saw the 2009 in the theatres, I was disappointed.  There were so many changes from the Star Trek I had grown up with.  But I bought this set and decided to give the movie a second chance.  (It would also be the first time I had seen Into Darkness.)

Star Trek (2009)
Please remember that this movie went out of its way to remind us - over and over again - that this is an alternate timeline.  Yes, Chris Pine's Kirk is a ""bad boy"" who isn't always as competent as Shatner's Kirk.  The Bridge is crowded, and the Engineering section is a mass of pipes.  Then there's the romance between Spock and Uhura. (And let's not forget the endless lens flares!  I was tempted to go find a pair of sunglasses!)
But, despite all these changes, it's still Star Trek in spirit.  Gene Roddenberry always said he wanted Star Trek to be ""about something"", and this is.  It even has a Deep Message: dealing with Loss.  The movie is flawed, but it works.  I was a skeptic, once.  I urge all other skeptics to give this movie a second viewing and be a little more objective.

Star Trek: Into Darkness
It's an obvious rip-off of The Wrath of Khan, but at the same time, it took many elements from that movie and turned them on their head.  And yes, we get the gratuitous women-in-underwear scenes.  In the first movie, it manages to come off as a sort of sexy comic relief, but here it serves no purpose beyond titillation. (Is this what we have to look forward to in Star Wars VII?) Alice Eve looks cute in her undies, but so what?  When you get to my age, you soon realize that when you've seen one (nearly) naked female, you've pretty much seen them all.  The supposedly romance between Spock and Uhura degenerates into cliche. not so much like a soap opera, but more like a bad sitcom.
But the story is pretty solid, full of unexpected twists and turns. (And no, I'm not going to spoil it for you.) Yep, the Deep Message is there, too, in Kirk's final speech.  Again, it's flawed, but it works.  The spirit of Star Trek survives. Whew!",1439424000,,2239,4.329326923076923

The other unique thing of this version, is that all release and unrelease featurettes of Star Trek Into Darkness are here.
The transfer for Star Trek (2009) is identical to its basic release, the presentation for Into Darkness contains a number of large-format IMAX shots, scenes and sequences, running anywhere from a matter of moments to several minutes.

5785638,2,B00D9SRBZC,"This is a review of the Star Trek two movie set on blu ray. I read a lot of reviews stating that extra features were spread across various releases of these movies so I thought I'd detail exactly what is included with this set since the information is not detailed anywhere else.
The first movie includes a director & crew commentary which was very entertaining, almost as good as the movie itself. They repeatedly refer to deleted scenes and making of documentaries which are not included. In fact, there are zero extras except for the commentary, not even a theatrical trailer. Very disappointing!
The second movie includes 6 short behind the scenes featurettes totaling 40 minutes. That's it!
I love the movies, except for the excessive use of lens flare, but I am returning my copy for a refund. With all the whining movie makers do about piracy, it is unfathomable to me that they would purposely perpetuate such a blatant rip off to paying customers. I'll stay with my bootleg copies until a more complete release is available. Unbelievable!",1429488000,2,1047,4.822222222222222

5785640,4,B00D9SRBZC,"This has a lot of extra featurettes, including a pretty cute gag reel. This was released a year and a half after the movie was in theaters so I'm not exactly sure who it's marketed for. It's pretty cool that both the 2009 and 2013 nu! Trek films were on this. If it had only been the flop Into Darkness sequel, I probably would not have purchased. I was tempted to give this three stars but, like I said, it has some pretty neat extras so it gets four. I'd only recommend buying this if you don't already own either of these new Star Trek films. The case is nice. It opens like a book with one blu-ray on either side and the silver lettering and Enterprise are embossed.",1427760000,,670,4.2015503875969
5785641,5,B00D9SRBZC,"It's all been said by the other reviewers.  I just purchased this set (March 2015) and it has all of the missing features mentioned in reviews from last year.  It's a great price for great ST action.  The hard cover is beautiful and feels strong and durable.  It really is a great looking set all around. See my attached images.

5785645,5,B00D9SRBZC,"I happen to believe that J.J. Abrams rescued and resuscitated Star Trek, and, with great ingenuity and generosity, gave it a new identity and a new chapter in what I hope is an infinite future for the ""franchise"" (perhaps one of the ugliest words in the English language). So, yes this compendium gets all the stars it is possible to get in this particular continuum. but let's also be honest: it's a bit of a stretch to call this a compendium when it includes only two movies. (And, yes, J.J., I'll say this here only because I can't think of another place to say it: I'm feeling a little hurt, and a little let down, that you left the ""Trek"" to go to ""Wars,"" but I'm hoping you are keeping watch over what is becoming one of the darkest nightmares Star Trek has ever encountered as the third film is being created (and why am I seeing an image of a stone slab with various body parts being sewn together with hopes that the creature will live again?).",1425340800,2,953,4.359550561797753
5785646,4,B00D9SRBZC,"I like that there is finally a pack for both J.J. Abrams directed modern generation Star Trek films. There is only one thing I dislike about this package is that it doesn't snap when you close it, other than that, the look and feel of it is great for fans and average film watchers. I do have an unboxing of this set on youtube if you would like to watch it!

5785647,3,B00D9SRBZC,"The only way to get all the bonus features for Star Trek Into Darkness as well as shifting aspect ratios for the IMAX scenes. For those unaware, on the initial home video release of Into Darkness had a lot of the bonus material split up as retailer exclusives, leaving the standard set pretty bare bones. The only way to get the IMAX version was to get a digital version from iTunes with commentary. The Compendium compiles all of the retailer exclusive content into one package. The Star Trek half of the set is the exact same discs from the original release.",1424304000,,560,4.554455445544554

5785650,3,B00D9SRBZC,"Star Trek Into Darkness was fine (the movie on blu-ray + dvd with additional features). It came right away, but a retailer for some reason forgot to ship Star Trek (goes on DVD). So I had to ask about it separately. But then he sent it to me later, and it was ok. Blu-ray works fine on all blu-ray devices like eg. PlayStation and the region codes don't matter, but for DVD you have to remember that US has a region code #1 and Europe has #2. So DVDs with #1 region won't work on eg. PlayStation, which supports only region #2, if it's bought in Europe. But those DVDs with region #1 work fine on my laptop, so it's ok.",1421280000,4,619,4.12396694214876
5785651,4,B00D9SRBZC,"Great bonus features, but the box for the discs really stinks.  It doesn't stay closed with any sort of snapping option and the discs'  content is not printed on the box anywhere (only on a piece of paper that is siliconed onto the back and can easily tear off).",1421107200,2,262,4.326530612244898

5785664,4,B00D9SRBZC,"A lot has been said about this set, and I will keep my review brief and focus on the movies, extras and the packaging.

The new Star Trek movies have their fans and their detractors, but they are good entertainment (with ""Into Darkness"" being the weaker entrant, being too illogical).
This set is aimed mostly at the Star Trek completist fan, and offers both movies as well as two additional discs full of extras. If the behind the scenes stuff floats your boat, this is the most cost-effective way to get it.

The weakest part of the set is the digibook packaging. I'm not a fan, primarily because without the slipcase, the spine tends to go crooked (and this is sometimes greatly helped by the shrink wrapping). Also the plastic trays for the discs are made of very hard plastic, so hard, in fact, that it is difficult to get the discs out and the discs flex alarmingly.

In conclusion, if you do not own the movies from before, or are a completist, this is the set for you. And if you hunted down all the various iterations of ""Into darkness"" when it first came out to get all the featurettes, I understand your frustration at Paramount's apparent fleecing of loyal fans.",1416700800,13,1174,4.528301886792453

5785669,1,B00D9SRBZC,"First I want to say, I love both movies and they are five stars. The extras are 5 stars (thank you Paramount for finally getting it right but you should have done it right the FIRST time).. The Video is 5 stars.. And for the most part, the audio quality is 5 stars. Why is the audio 5 stars for the most part and not just simply 5 stars? There is a terrible audio glitch on Star Trek Into Darkness where the audio drops out several times through out the movie when decoding the 7.1 Dolby True HD track. Paramount needs to get their Blu-Ray releases right the first time and not make us buy another version to get what we wanted in the first place. As far as I know, Paramount isn't doing anything to correct the problem with the audio.",1414886400,2,735,4.183098591549296
5785670,5,B00D9SRBZC,"Don't listen to the haters. All those 1-star reviews are protests against studio double-dipping. Usually, that's a good principle to stand for, but this is one case where allowances should be made.

The first Blu-ray release of Into Darkness was badly bungled. The special features were divided amongst various retailer exclusives, and no single edition was all-inclusive. Worse, the biggest (and I think most interesting) special feature - the Enhanced Commentary - was only available as an iTunes Extra at 720p (although the required Digital Copy code was included). It's as if the studio forgot that Blu-ray supports seamless branching; this was a perfect use case for that feature. Finally, unlike other movies with IMAX scenes, the Blu-ray did not adjust its aspect ratio during IMAX sequences to show off the larger format.

Finally, with this re-release, all three problems have been addressed. The studio actually consulted some consumer reviewers - particularly The Digital Bits - to find out what they did wrong with the first release, and to get advice on how to fix it. To their credit, Paramount accepted the advice they were given, and the result is a proper release of Into Darkness that checks all the boxes. The special features are all here, including the enhanced commentary in 1080p via seamless branching, and the IMAX scenes are now un-masked to fill the 16x9 frame.

Instead of punishing the product that was done properly by giving it a harsh protest review, I want to give Paramount due credit for finally getting it right. If you want to protest double-dipping, I suggest protesting the first release, which was so bad that it necessitated this double-dip to make amends.

In addition to the upgraded presentation of Into Darkness, this set also includes the 2009 film, with the same 2 discs of content as the first release (which was well done from the get-go). Surprisingly, it also includes a fresh batch of Digital Copy and UltraViolet codes for both films, so now you can add both of them to your streaming library of your choice, in full HD.

The only small complaint I have is that the case feels a bit flimsy. It's sort of book-style, but it lacks the outer enclosure that usually accompanies such nonstandard packaging. Including a nice ""sheath"" - something like the Dark Knight Trilogy Blu-ray packaging, for example - would make it feel much sturdier. But that's a minor quibble. For me, content is king, and this Blu-ray set has just about everything a JJ-Trek fan could want.",1414886400,3,2514,4.933806146572104

5785686,4,B00D9SRBZC,"The first thing that comes to a person's mind when they see a deluxe edition home video of a movie they already own is usually whether or not it's worth spending more money to have the additional stuff being offered. Some offer physical trinkets, others have bonus discs full of additional behind-the-scenes materials or even extended/alternate versions of the movie. With this ""Star Trek Compendium,"" which collects only the last two ""Star Trek"" films (the ""Abrams"" series), the bonus here is the IMAX version of the second film, as well as the complete bonus features (the original home video's bonuses were split up across numerous retailers, each offering them as ""exclusives""). Not many people were happy about that, so Paramount has ""corrected"" the problem. Kind of...

First, a quick review of the films (for those who have not seen them and are looking at this to determine whether or not it's worth buying at all). Set in an alternate timeline for the Original Series, the films follow a younger version of Captain James Kirk's crew as they take the USS-Enterprise through the far reaches of space.  The first film sees a rogue Romulan crew flung back in time through a wormhole, altering the course of Star Trek history. When James grows up and enlists in Starfleet, he finds himself doing battle with those Romulans with the crew of the Enterprise at hs back in order to save the Earth from destruction. In the second film, the further-reaching consequences of the new timeline are further explored, as a new villain threatens the only family Kirk has left: his crew.

The films are both incredible fun. Everyone from Chris Pine (Kirk) and Zachary Quinto (Spock) to John Cho (Sulu) and Karl Urban (McCoy) is in top form. Action sequences are effects-packed and never dull. Some hardcore Trek enthusiasts don't like these films, but that's their opinion.

As for this collection, it's well worth the price of admission. Both films are presented on Blu-ray in 1080p, with two discs of supplemental materials, one for each film. The ""Star Trek"" disc includes all material from the original 2009 Blu-ray release, while ""Into Darkness"" includes all the ""exclusive"" materials from the original release last fall, all advertised as ""new""; though the 3D-version is not present, the IMAX version will suffice. The bonuses also include gag-reels on both films, deleted scenes, and trailers, as well as immersive commentary tracks and other behind-the-scenes info. The packaging itself is nice and pretty; the cover is matte-finish with raised lettering and a top-down view of USS Enterprise. The discs are nice looking as well; the discs with the films have Kirk and Spock on them while the bonus discs for each film have that respective film's villain. My only complaint with this set is the fact that the case itself does not ""click"" shut and will swing upen freely, but a minor gripe with an otherwise superb set.

If you don't have these films, or have never seen them, this is the set to grab. If you do own them, then consider getting it anyway because it's a pretty neat set, bonuses and all.",1410998400,2,3100,4.897142857142857
5785687,4,B00D9SRBZC,"Side note: I have never seen anything related to Star Trek before the 2009 and 2013 movies.

JJ Abrams entertaining Star Trek films have been critically received by a legion of die-hard fans who've refused to admit that there is good to be found in the new movies.  Both Star Trek and Star Trek Into Darkness demonstrate a balance between the lighthearted fun we used to get in movies like Spider-Man, and the dark stories we are only getting as a result of The Dark Knight.

The performances are great, the villains are great, and even though these are not groundbreaking films they are worth a view for those days where you want to lay back and have fun.

In regards to the package itself:

I'm not entirely sure why Amazon has decided to stop selling the Compendium, but everything that was advertised for this set I received.  The Into Darkness blu ray contains the scenes shot in IMAX, and all the bonus features that were previously scattered across various stores.  I've seen some people here complain that the first Star Trek is not the IMAX version, but I don't know what they're talking about considering the first Star Trek had zero scenes shot on IMAX film.

In all, the movies are great and are packages in a good-looking black case that is worth spending $30 for.",1410912000,2,1277,4.594713656387666
5785688,5,B00D9SRBZC,"I'm a Trekkie.  I'm going to preface that right now.  I grew up with the syndicated episodes of TOS, the movies, the cartoon, TNG, Voyager and so on...

I was actually hesitant to see the 09 Trek, because it was taking EVERYTHING I KNEW and tossing it on its ear.  But lemme tell you a thing...  JJ Abrams didn't disappoint.  Sure, there were plotholes.  There were plotholes the size of Jupiter.  But it was an action ride in the vein of Wrath of Khan and it was such a fun movie to watch.

And the casting choices were superb.  I LOVE that Urban's portrayal was so spot-on that Leonard Nimoy was brought to tears.

Conversely.. we have STID.  Into Darkness had the potential to be something FANTASTIC and NEVER BEFORE SEEN (and yes, I'm using a LOT OF CAPS.. I'm excited, dammit).  And then it wasn't.  Don't get me wrong, I liked Into Darkness.  I just feel that they didn't do the Khan storyline justice in the Alternate 'Verse.  This is, by no means, a slam on Benedict Cumberbatch's acting skills.  The man can act.  There is no doubt about that.  I just feel that they should have given him a different character.

And for the love of god, GIVE THE WOMEN UNIFORMS THAT SHOW THEIR RANK!!!!  This is not the 1960s people.  Uhura and Marcus (and the other unnamed women who didn't get the attention they deserved, either) DESERVE to have their rank shown on their uniforms.

But that being said, I still enjoyed the movie.  I did.  I felt that they did the whole KHAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNN thing a little too soon, given that Spock and Jim were really not /that/ close yet.  But hey.. it's whatever.  I just really hope that they give Urban a little more screentime in the 3rd movie and make it the true Triumvirate instead of the Dynamic Duo.  Both Urban and McCoy deserve that.

Should you see the movies?  YES. Should you get this compendium?  HELL YES.  The extras and outtakes and bloopers and such make it totally worth it, IMO. You should also see the new one when it comes out, too.  For Reasons.",1410566400,2,2005,4.465373961218837

  This compendium finally gives you exactly what you wanted: IMAX version of the film & all the special features in one collection (like so many people have ASKED FOR). Sounds to me that this was more about the fans than an attempt to double dip. For that I say ""thank you Paramount"" for listening. On top of everything, Paramount is offering a $5 rebate for anyone who has purchased them before.
  As for the exclusive special feature, I feel like no one realizes that this is standard for all high box office films. If you don't believe me, check Target weekly ad. There is a Target exclusive Blu ray coming out every other week. It's time to stop the Trek bashing & understand that Trek is a tentpole movie & all tentpole movie have different feature through different companies. It is one way to ensure that a movie is successful enough to continue making more....

5785695,1,B00D9SRBZC,"I urge others to vote with their money, and not buy this set.

Too many of the ""bonus"" materials were spread out as exclusives to different retailers where if you wanted all of the features that are NOW being offered, one had to buy multiple copies of ""Into Darkness"".  Paramount then realized what a mistake they did due to the amount of backlash that the studio received.

They, then, called in highly respected owners of different websites to discuss how Paramount could make it up to the fans which resulted in this release.  One other aspect that was deemed critical was the fact that many fans have ALREADY purchased the original Blu-ray release, and Paramount stated they would offer a rebate to those who made that purchase.

As is turns out, this set not only includes ""Into the Darkness"", but also the 2009 movie which is the same exact version originally released.  Now the rebate that was offered to the current owners is only $5.00.

Right now, both movies can be bought off of Amazon for under $10.00 each.  Basically one will have to pay $28.00 ($33.99 - $5.00) to get the extras for ""Into Darkness"" alone.

I, for one, do not want to buy both movies again in order to get those extras.  Mark my words, the price will drop on this set during the holiday season, thus negating the $5.00 rebate Paramount thought would please the current owners of these movies.",1409443200,24,1374,4.617283950617284

5785702,5,B00D9SRBZC,"This is,the one time in my life I don't care if I date myself. I have watched every Star Trek show/movie released since this new idea of a future that is full of hope and wonder, with a monster which gets the c##p kicked out of it as the human race was seen through the eyes of Gene Roddenberry as a compassionate, unpolitical, curious, and most of all, advanced through much work and the best minds humanity has to offer who just wanted to go out and meet other races, peacefully. It was a noble, encouraging, exciting time and Star Trek almost literally defined today's Science Fiction genre.

Forty-eight years of the best television ever offered, imho, and the last two are a low-rated double pack of the Two newest Star Trek movies. At the most, these two movies were not boring, they encompassed the humor and energy and kept to a specific message outlined above. At the worst, well, I thought they were very good. Then again, I watch for entertainment. I don't pick at every little detail because I can. And, I'd rather have these movies than no movies or shows at all, which, since JJ only made them to show Mr. Lucas he was up to the task of bringing the last three movies of Star Wars to the big screen and keep them true to the original dream.

So, that leaves us now with no one good enough to make any more Star Trek anything. Lighten up, people. So many of you gobbled up 50 Shades of Grey like it was Shakespeare! It was sex c##p next to the WORST Star trek movie or show, and more people know about it than Star Trek these days. What that says about society today I'll leave to all of you who know better.

5785705,5,B00D9SRBZC,"MY REVIEW OF THE COMPENDIUM

""Star Trek: The Compendium"" is a five-star product, I have seen Star Trek 2009 about a dozen times so far, and have seen Into Darkness three times so far. The extras are interesting, but I'm not sure they were as good as extras have been with other movies.

EXTRAS THAT YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY BUY

In order to more fully understand the pre-history that came before the Star Trek 2009 reboot, you should read the mini-comic that appeared in WIRED magazine (I wish I still had my copy), which starts with the old Spock, trapped on the ice planet, reminiscing about what brought him to that point in time. Unfortunately, it is not easy to find on the Internet now that WIRED magazine took it off their website.

Even more importantly, please read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-Countdown/dp/1600106390/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek: Countdown</a>, a 104-page graphic novel where you will see how everything started in the future on Stardate 64333.4 (which I assume is the 25th century). Its cast of extras includes Captain Data of the U.S.S. Enterprise, Ambassador Picard, Mister Geordi LaForge (designer of star ships), and more. You will see how Nero actually started out as one of the good guys, and see the great efforts that Ambassador Spock went through to convince the Romulans to even let him try.

Another good resource for understanding the 2009 reboot is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-Movie-Tie-in-Novelization-2009/dp/1439194874/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek: Movie Tie-in Novelization (2009)</a>. I read this soon after the movie came out, and it helped me get some of the details I didn't catch at first. The book makes it much clearer that The Guardian of Forever might somehow be involved in trying to remold the flow of time in such a way to bring the entire crew together years earlier than they did in the original series. By the way, the movie ends with Admiral Archer's prize beagle materializing in an empty corridor on the Enterprise. Admiral Archer, of course, was Captain of the original Enterprise (on the fifth TV series).

There are similar resources for Into Darkness, but they are not needed as much for a fuller understanding of the second movie, so I am not listing them here.

MY RATINGS

Paramount: One Star for not releasing more extra features the first go round

The Compendium: Six Stars for being a great product with features I that I love.

Gene Roddenberry: Eight Stars for his invaluable inspiration that so nicely moved us into a new Trek Universe.

AVERAGE RATING:  FIVE STARS",1404691200,27,2669,5.358851674641149
5785706,1,B00D9SRBZC,"Where is the 3-D version? Apparently this is scheduled as a triple dip. It's not like they did not have the IMAX version at the time of the original release? It is one thing when new formats and new technology emerges, but his is not the case here.",1404432000,30,248,4.1875
5785707,1,B00D9SRBZC,"Sorry, but somebody has to say it. It's absolutely outrageous that Paramount is double-dipping like this by holding back the Star Trek Into Darkness special features for this release. Many of us who bought the STID blu-ray last fall complained that the special features had been split up between different retailers (Best Buy, Target, Amazon, etc got different exclusives) and NO deleted scenes. As a reward for our loyalty in purchasing the blu-ray early we now get the opportunity to purchase the complete version almost a year later.

To be clear, I do not mind studios releasing deluxe versions of a movie. It's great for fans of movies to have deluxe options. But I don't like the studio telling us that certain features are exclusive and then going back on that promise. Nor do I appreciate the studio not telling us that a version with the deleted scenes would be coming. For comparison, Peter Jackson has been very up front in telling fans that extended versions of the Lord of the Rings/Hobbit movies would be released and WHEN they would be released.

I think it's important that movie consumers take a stand and tell Paramount that consumers will not stand for such practices. The best way to do that is to refuse to buy this set. If studios want us to buy blu-rays and not just stream movies, then treat us as premium customers rather than gullible suckers.

UPDATE: There is a bit of good news. Apparently Paramount will offer a rebate for customers who had previously bought an earlier blu-ray version of STID. This is some consolation and makes the double-dip less problematic. Nevertheless, I think it is still important for consumers to send the right message.",1404259200,427,1677,4.815972222222222
5785708,5,B00D9SRBZC,"This is a 2-movie box set that contains the reimagining of ""Star Trek"" (2009) and the sequel ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" (2013), directed by JJ Abrams. There are 3 reasons why you might want to consider purchasing this set - I own these films already, but will be picking this up because of the reasons listed below:

1. Those who saw ""Into Darkness"" in IMAX theaters may remember that for certain scenes the aspect ratio of the film shifted from the typical 2.40:1 to the taller 1.78:1, creating a larger and more immersive image. Unfortunately, the original blu-ray release of Into Darkness did not include the IMAX footage... But this one does, meaning for those scenes it will fill your entire TV (instead of the usual black bars on the top and bottom).
2. This set also includes an Enhanced Commentary for ""Into Darkness"" that was previously exclusive to iTunes. Basically you play the movie, but all sorts of content appears on the screen while you watch and the director/crew will come on at various points to talk about the film (it's similar to the WB 'maximum movie mode' feature that is on discs like Watchmen and Terminator Salvation).
3. The bonus disc for ""Into Darkness"" has some new deleted scenes and additional bonus material that was not previously available.

Below is a complete listing of all the content in this four-disc set:

Disc 1 - Star Trek (2009)
- Star Trek in high definition
- commentary by J.J. Abrams, Bryan Burk, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof and Roberto Orci

Disc 2 - Star Trek (2009)
- To Boldly Go -- Taking on the world's most beloved science fiction franchise was no small mission. Director J.J. Abrams, writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, producer Damon Lindelof, and executive producer Bryan Burk talk about the many challenges they faced and their strategy for success.
- Casting -- The producers knew their greatest task was finding the right cast to reprise these epic roles. The cast, for their part, talk about the experience of trying to capture the essence of these mythic characters. The piece concludes with a moving tribute to Leonard Nimoy.
- A New Vision -- J.J. Abrams' vision was not only to create a Star Trek that was a bigger, more action-packed spectacle, but also to make the spectacle feel real. Every aspect of production--from unique locations to the use of classic Hollywood camera tricks--was guided by this overall objective.
- Starships -- Abrams and production designer Scott Chambliss were careful to pay tribute to the design of the original Enterprise, but they also wanted to make it futuristic and cool for a modern audience. This chapter focuses on the unique stories behind the creation of the film's starships.
- Aliens -- Designers Neville Page and Joel Harlow talk about the hurdles they faced creating new alien species, recreating the Romulans and Vulcans, and designing the terrifying creatures on Delta Vega for the new Star Trek
- Planets -- From the frozen landscape of Delta Vega to the desert plains of Vulcan, Scott Chambliss and the art department had a number of radically different planets to create. Abrams' desire to shoot on real locations whenever possible led the production team to a number of strange and surprising locations.
- Props and Costumes -- Property master Russell Bobbitt had the unique challenge of designing props that were both true to the original series and pertinent to today's technology. Likewise, costume designer Michael Kaplan talks about how he designed costumes that paid homage to what came before yet were relevant and timeless.
- Ben Burtt and the Sounds of Star Trek -- When famed sound designer Ben Burtt was hired to create sounds for the first Star Wars film, he took his inspiration from the original Star Trek series. Burtt jumped at the opportunity to pay tribute to the sounds that sparked his career with the sounds he created for the new Star Trek.
- Score -- As a fan of the original series, composer Michael Giacchino embraced the challenge of creating new music for Star Trek while preserving the spirit of Alexander Courage's celebrated theme.
- Gene Roddenberry's Vision -- J.J. Abrams, Leonard Nimoy, previous Star Trek writers and producers, and scientific consultant Carolyn Porco describe and commend the optimistic and enduring vision of Gene Roddenberry.
- Deleted Scenes with Optional Commentary
