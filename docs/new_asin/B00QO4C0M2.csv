8692239,5,B00QO4C0M2,"This movie really gives an eye opening view of what is behind the climate change sponsors.  I never would have put these two things together, but the Soviet Union had to collapse in order for the Earth Summit to be successful, because it united the East and West together.  The movie explains that the fight against global warming is actually a fight against capitalism, the same way Communism fought capitalism.  Instead of East and West fighting each other, the new enemy is CO2.  The film has some great interviews and touches on some topics I never thought about, for instance the way schools are being used to alter values to make them more ""green"" and how green cities are reminiscent of Communist housing projects.  One of the people being interviewed said that the greenest cities used to be in Communist East Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall.  I think the film is original in its approach and presents some viewpoints I did not think of.  I highly recommend this film, give it to your liberal friends and see if it persuades them.  If you think this is all a conspiracy, just wait until the end of the film.",1419897600,18,1126,4.595
