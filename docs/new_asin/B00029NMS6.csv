2071607,1,B00029NMS6,This is not part of the What's New Scooby Doo Volume set. It shows Volume 2 on the picture and clearly shows that 4 episodes are on the DVD ... but it is actually only 2 episodes from that volume ... NOT the full volume as pictured. I ordered it and got the wrong one .. sent it back and they sent me the same thing a second time. I LOVE LOVE LOVE Amazon ... but I was really frustrated that I couldn't actually get a PERSON to understand my problem. I just kept getting these emails back from someone who obviously didn't read my email or understand what was going on ... maybe it was automated .. who knows! I finally just gave up and found it at Walgreen's for $5.99. Bottom line ... don't order this if you want Volume 2!,1168041600,,725,4.076923076923077

2071609,5,B00029NMS6,"Volume 3 of the ""What's New Scooby-Doo?"" DVD collection, is one of thhe better volumes out there. It contains four episodes from the television series, and the monsters featured in them are the classic Halloween stuff. I liked the DVD becomes the episodes weren't obvious mysteries or dead give-aways. Each case was different and original, with a very organized plot, clever clues, and a very surprising ending. One of the best Scooby-Doo incarnations, I might say these episodes are even better than the original ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?"" A nice volume to buy!

The episodes included are:

1) The Vampire Strikes Back - A vampire is trying to ruin the Hex Girl's music video at a castle. (A+)

2) Mummy Scares Best - A mummy is hypnotizing tourists near the Moon Pyramid. (A+)

3) High-Tech House of the Future - A futuristic house attraction is kidnapping visitors! (A+)

4) She Sees The Sea Monster By The Sea Shore - A mysterious sea monster causes trouble by the water. (A+)

Even though the episodes aren't necessarily my favorite ones of the series, I do have to say that they deserve no less than a 10/10. This is a good volume the entire family would enjoy!",1151107200,21,1169,4.705882352941177

The High-Tech episode was the most imaginative. I didn't watch the extra features yet, because as a whole this Scooby-Doo was rather long and boring. I bought this used on Amazon so the price was right. I recommend to anyone who's considering buying this DVD to purchase it used and save some money.",1426204800,,527,4.666666666666667

2071644,3,B00029NMS6,"My 5 year old loves the Scooby Doo Where Are You dvd I picked up for him last year so I picked this one as a Halloween present. I didn't realize What's New Scooby Doo was a different series, it was not on tv when I was a kid. The episodes are a little scarier and the characters are less pleasant. I don't remember Daphne being such a stereotype of a dumb, self-centered pretty girl in the old series. In one episode one of the minor characters calls his brother a ""pea-brain"". My kids (5 and 2) find this hilarious because they think he's saying ""pee brain"" and now call each other that non-stop. sigh",1356048000,3,602,4.243478260869566

2071646,1,B00029NMS6,"I'm not gonna make someone happy with this review, but I can safely say I did NOT like ""What's New Scooby-Doo."" I could even go as far as saying I hated it! I grew up with classic Scooby-Doo as a kid, even though I wasn't alive yet when the original show started in 1969, I knew about the show during the 1990s, watching reruns of the original ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?"" series on Cartoon Network, along with the ""New Scooby-Doo Movies,"" ""A Pup Named Scooby-Doo,"" even the ""Zombie Island"" and ""Witch's Ghost"" movies were pretty good! Unfortunately, the switching of production companies (from Hanna-Barbera to Warner Bros. Animation, whom has had a long famous legacy since 1930) was a major blow to the series.
With Sander Schwartz (the worst president of Warner Bros. Animation EVER) running things, you know things aren't going to go well. It didn't have that Hanna-Barbera look and feel; instead it looked more like Adelaide Productions (""Men in Black: the Series,"" ""Jackie Chan Adventures,"" ""Dragon Tales"") produced it instead, and the animation was the usual 2000s ""house"" animation style many WB and Adelaide shows at the time were using, animated in Korea (mostly by Lotto and DongWoo Animation.) It was also pretty much just a parody of the old show, up to the point where the parodies were no longer funny! (EVERY episode had to parody the ""meddling kids"" line, and EVERY episode had to feature some wacky musical chase, etc. And at times some other part of the formula would be lampshaded, like Fred wanting to set a trap BEFORE the gang splits up.) And their use of modern technology as a ""See how up-to-date and modern this show is compared to the old version!"" sort of thing didn't help either (I seem to recall one episode they swiped the ""Uh... Internet?"" joke from the Fairly Odd Parents.)

Fred was also drastically dumbed down, sort of like on ""A Pup Named Scooby-Doo,"" but not as funny. And the show rarely focused on Scooby-Doo himself! Usually it would just focus on Fred, Daphne and Velma. The show also generally tried to be more ""realistic"" and more like real-life compared to the older, more cartoony shows. In fact, as part of this they even dumped using the classic Hanna-Barbera sound effects! (Well for the most part, they still used some, but usually it was the same 20 or 30 effects repeated over and over.)

Definitely not what I hoped for. There were only a few good episodes, and then there were some that were absolute garbage, like the episodes on this disc, most notably ""The Vampire Strikes Back"" (sorry, even the Hex Girls couldn't save it, and it was also a very poor semi-knock off of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Mouse-Detective-Mystery-in-the-Mist-Edition/dp/B0034GK74G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Mouse Detective (Mystery in the Mist Edition)</a>) Also, it's no surprise many of the staff members that worked on this show also worked on the aborted awful 2003-2004 Looney Tunes cartoons (some of which are also on DVD, like ""The Whizzard of OW.""

I was very disappointed and angry at Warner Bros. Animation for ruining the Scooby-Doo franchise, after making four great direct-to-video Scooby-Doo movies. It also makes me sad, because Warner Bros. Animation also made some great Looney Tunes cartoon shorts from the 1930s until the 1960s. I can't believe the company that brought me such classics as ""One Froggy Evening,"" ""What's Opera Doc,"" ""Duck Amuck"" and ""The Great Piggy Bank Robbery"" would sink so low to making a very subpar Scooby-Doo revival. Ever since then, I haven't trusted Warner Bros. Animation with their new stuff when being announced (such as when ""The Looney Tunes Show"" was about to come out, I was afraid they'd screw up in the same way; so far they've only screwed up on dumbing down Lola Bunny like they did to Fred here.)
In fact, this show was also very similar to the later Looney Tunes cartoons the company produced in 1967 to 1969 (under the Warner Bros.- Seven Arts banner), mostly run by a new crew who did very ugly Daffy Duck vs. Speedy Gonzales cartoons (like ""Fiesta Fiasco"" and ""See Ya Later Gladiator"") and created Cool Cat and Merlin the Magic Mouse. But then again, even Cool Cat's cartoons were way better than this horrid insult to the Scooby-Doo franchise.

(I normally don't do reviews like this, but I had a lot of trouble sleeping last night due to an awful thunderstorm like the one in the ""Vampire Strikes Back"" episode here, and figured sharing my thoughts here would be a good way to blow off some steam! Stay tuned for when I do an even better review on a Scooby-Doo DVD I got and enjoyed...)",1350691200,,4652,4.907242693773824
2071647,5,B00029NMS6,"If you love ""real"" Scooby, watch this, especially the Hex Girls episode and the ""She Sees Monsters"" ep.
