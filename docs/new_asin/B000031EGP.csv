7916401,1,B000031EGP,"For all serious film buffs and film professionals out there-

though I command the filmmaker's devotion to and reverence of John Cassavetes - whom I myself admire, respect and keep on learning from - the best that the author of ""John Cassavetes: To Risk Everything to Express it All"" could've done (to honor the memory  and the cultural heritage of J. Cassavetes) is to never release this amateurish, studentish, poorly crafted, highly unoriginal video reportage. I find it disrespectful toward the memory of the great man. The self-proclaimed ""Fascinating portrait ..."" smells nothing short of shameful exploitation. It is equally sad the the ""admirer"" of  J. Cassevetes happens to be completely blind as to not being able to see the  degree of mediocrity of his effort. Perhaps, next time around, the author of the above work should rewatch the films of J. Cassavetes prior to releasing his ""home"" video efforts.",1102377600,,914,5.073333333333333
7916402,4,B000031EGP,"In this documentary,you learn about HIM,his way of being,of working which are so closely bound. The title says it all,Cassavettes used to risk everything on a set,to express all human feelings,from love to hate. It's  always a pleasure to hear(about)him,so charismatic and moving,just as much  as those testimonies by Gena,Nick and all those people we know so well. The  video could be a little longuer but it's worth it! ENJOY.",961113600,8,428,5.085714285714285
