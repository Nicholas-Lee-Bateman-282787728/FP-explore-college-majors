3967379,4,B000PY9QSS,"Movie was good.  However, there was a repeating problem with the streaming.  The movie kept jumping to a particular spot midway through the movie and wouldn't progress forward.  You couldn't fast forward at all.  Took repeated attempts/reboots to get to the end of the movie.  Haven't had this problem with other movies.",1402963200,,320,5.076923076923077
3967380,4,B000PY9QSS,"I picked this movie because it looked rather lonely on Amazon Instant watch and in need of some attention.  On the whole I'm glad I did.

As the description says, the movie is three stories in one with the common theme really being men who figure out what exactly is important to them.  There's a strong element of Cricket in each case but it's not really the point of the movie so much as a convenient backdrop.

On the positive side, the stories each have a strong sociological comment to make.  One man is obsessed with sport, one with his job and one with his position in society.  In pursuing their obsessions they've all completely lost sight of what's actually important and what brings them joy.  Throughout the film we see the characters change and evolve into better people than when they started out.  This is a movie to watch when you're ready to have a long, serious think about your life.  The movie also offers a few laughs but nothing gut-wrenching.

To the negative, the movie does seem to take a while to get rolling.  It's not one that grabs you and won't let go.

In summary, a pretty good film if you want to contemplate your life.  It's not filled with Bollywood dance numbers if that sort of thing scares you away but it's got a fair amount of peppy Indian music to keep your ears entertained while you're reading the subtitles.",1396742400,4,1351,4.487704918032787
3967381,4,B000PY9QSS,"This is an interesting movie with three interlocking story lines:  a doctor who sees all of his patients as statistics runs into a former cricket player who is dying, but seems to care more about seeing the cricket world series than staying alive; an Indian living in Britain wants citizenship so badly that he loses himself; and a newlywed couple where the wife watches cricket matches to make her husband happy, and then says the name of one of the cricket players when they're about to have sex.

The acting is good, the stories are interesting and come to satisfactory conclusions, and the only negative is that there aren't the usual song and dance numbers until the closing credits.

Worth buying.",1357948800,,703,4.793388429752066
3967382,3,B000PY9QSS,"In HATTRICK, the three stories proceed simultaneously.
Milan Luthria's direction is satisfactory, but it's the writing that acts as a spoke in the wheel. Pritam's music is strictly okay. You watch the songs on the big screen without exhibiting any emotion, but forget all about them once the movie ends. 'Wicket Bacha' is the only track that stands out, partly due to its zany filming. Cinematography [Nirmal Jani] is lucid.

The performances are up to the mark. Nana carries his part with precision. There're certain roles he excels in and this is one of those. Danny is extremely likable. All you want to ask the veteran is, Where have you been all this while? Paresh gets a serious role this time and the actor proves his versatility yet again.",1304467200,,747,4.790697674418604
