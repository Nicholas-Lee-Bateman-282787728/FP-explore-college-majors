8150239,5,B000JFXRX8,"first one is uncensored! the beginning is longer and has some very morally course language in it. the back locker-room sex scene with Kim Cattrall is longer than the scene where she jumps on the jock and the fight scene between the jock and the Jew is a little longer.

the us version of this film is cut by at least 6 minutes. i have not watched parts 2 and 3 because those films to me are lacking in Exploitational value. i really do think censorship is total nonsense.",1406764800,,471,4.292134831460674
