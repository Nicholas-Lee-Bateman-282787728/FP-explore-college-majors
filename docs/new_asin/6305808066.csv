1073448,5,6305808066,"I collect all these Vampire moves, spcially on's with female vampires. The acting and setting is some of the best in the genera. The sex is erotic not tacky. Overall a well done and orginal take on the theme. The ending is a bit of a cope out, but just go with the story and forget the hangover.",993254400,,295,4.103448275862069
1073449,2,6305808066,"On the dvd commentary, one of the producers admits that they made this film with 2 things in mind - sex and blood. That should serve as a warning. A poorly executed plot (if you can call it that) simply serves as an excuse to show the two stars having sex, sex and more sex. To its credit, the film does have a gothic feel to it with a castle setting and moody lighting. But, unfortunately, you need much more to make a good film. Nothing of significance happens during the first 40 minutes and the dialogue is inane. A total bore, of interest only to heterosexual men.",972432000,5,569,4.277777777777778
1073450,5,6305808066,"Though I'd seen it once before in Magnum's now out of print pan-and-scan version, I just rewatched this 1974 lesbian vampire film in Anchor Bay's recent uncut reissue. I must say, they really do wonders at Anchor Bay with the films they release. Seeing it with such an improved picture and in widescreen for the first time, I was really able to appreciate as I hadn't before just how beautifully composed and photographed this film is.
Yes, as director Joseph Larraz himself has said, the film does deliver on the ""blood and naked women"". But Vampyres really is so much more than *just* an exploitaion film.
The film really, I think, brings a fresh approach to the whole vampire theme, jettisoning nearly all the typical conventions and cliches of vampire films that Hammer and Universal had built up in thier films, in exchange for approaches that I think are pretty unique to the film.
The gothic atmosphere is very well done, and I liked that Larraz accomplished this without the usual reliance on fake dry ice fog and fake lightning and thunder and the like. Rather, everything was accomplished through superb use of the late autumn English woods and country location settings, as well as the great choice of location shooting sites for the Vampyres' mansion and its interiors (no studio sets in this one). And great shots of the actual sky and clouds. Vampyres is probably one of the most naturalistic of gothic horror movies.
Marianne Morris and Anulka are really superb in thier roles. It's not just thier looks, but an amazing on-screen presence and intensity, and a willingness to throw themselves into every scene with total commitment and relish. The scenes with them stalking the woods are just as stunning as any of the more ""active"" scenes in the film.
And finally, as for the ""exploitation"" elements, the sexuality, while venturing into soft core territory, is imaginative and done with genuine style, while the violence is unusually realistic and genuinely horrifying for a vampire film.
Anyway, this is a film that I'm really glad I purchased and gave a second look to, and I can't say enough good things about what Anchor Bay has done for the film.
Just a final note regarding the reviewer who said he thought a particular scene was cut short--I could detect no cuts in Anchor Bay's version compared to the out of print uncut Magnum release.  As far as I can tell, Anchor Bay's version is totally intact and uncut, and the digital remastering and widescreen presentation make this the best version ever offered.",972086400,13,2529,4.840646651270208
1073451,2,6305808066,"I would have given this film more stars, but there a serious plot problems. _Vampyres_, when it even has a plot, is so repetitive that I lost all interest in the story 30 minutes into the viewing.  As another reviewer mentions, everyone is just walking through moody interior and exterior shots not doing or saying anything of any particular interest.
Two bisexual vampires lovers hitchhike on a nearby road to pick up men.  They take the men back to their mouldering mansion, get them drunk and kill them.  Innocently viewing the actions of the vampires is a couple on a weekend getaway, living out of an RV that is parked practically on the front lawn of the mansion.  That's it.  That's the story.  On a couple of occasions, there appears to be some foreshadowing of darker forces at work...but both of those hints are just left hanging by the end of the film.
The movie was originally marketed as an ""adult horror film"" which I interpret as meaning soft porn with a horror theme.  Maybe it's too much to expect plot from that kind of production.  If you're looking for a good story or great acting, don't bother with _Vampyres_.  You'll just be wasting your time and money.
On the other hand, with regard to mood, lighting, set decoration, location, makeup special effects (the blood, in particular) and filming techniques, _Vampyres_ is a beautiful film to watch.  It was originally released in 1974 and I have to admit that, aesthetically speaking, it has either aged well or the remastering worked wonders.  There was something intoxicating about the soft-focused, low-light, grainy quality of the images.  It put me in the mind of a lot of those old vampire films (especially the Italian horror films) I watched as a young man on Saturday afternoons back in the 70s.
The sex scenes were somehow entertaining -- not for the sex itself (which were either badly choreographed or just clumsily executed) but more for the blood-letting aspect of their carnal endeavors.  If you saw Bram Stoker's Dracula (a la F.F. Coppola) then you'll probably remember the three vampire brides feeding on poor stupid Keanu Reeves.  The scenes in that film were very Hollywood, very stylized.  No so in _Vampires_.  I'd describe the depiction of the blood orgies in this film as ""natural.""  The kills seemed quite realistic to me.
So, if you are looking for more stuff like _The Lost Boys_, _Interview With The Vampire_ or _Bram Stoker's Dracula_, you should look elsewhere and leave this one to everyone who loved _The Keep_.",970617600,9,2513,4.82051282051282
1073452,4,6305808066,"Anchor Bay bills its version as fully restored. Viewers of the older, Magnum Entertainment version will find that the scenes of the two tourists being murdered are longer and, in my opinion, more effective.",961286400,,206,5.088235294117647
1073453,3,6305808066,"The opening scene of Vampyres introduces us to our two main characters, Fran (Marianne Morris) and Miriam (Anulka). These two lusty lovers are writhing around as a sinister shadow approaches. The two are fatally shot.  The sexual carnivores now lure unexpecting motorists to their castle to  drink their blood and sexual recreation. Several questions quickly come to  mind. How did these two become vampires? Who killed them? Why don't they  have fangs? Why do they slash the victims and drink the blood? (of course  that refers to the previous question) Why are they seen running around in  the daytime? and What does the couple camping in the woods have to do with  anything? In spite of these burning questions, it is an entertaining piece  of T&A horror, with lots of blood, gore, and sex. Faithful followers of  the Hammer vampire genre will be a little distracted by the digression from  the vampire tale, but the nudity should bring'em around.",960336000,2,950,4.918238993710692

It has a nice gothic ambience  reminiscient of the classic chillers of the 70's.  Not only is there a fair  amount of sex(if you like that sort of thing)but also plenty of nicely  colored blood, not red paint.  Highly recommended for everyone.",952300800,12,500,4.869047619047619

1074902,4,6305808066,"First, a big, big, big caveat: I bought the so-called ""multi-format"" version of this expecting to get a Blu-ray/DVD version as I did with The Slave. This is not what I got. I got a multi REGION Blu-ray copy. So buyer beware.

The movie dates from the early 70s to judge by the visual feel of the thing. The ladies spend a nice amount of time sans clothing which is very important for the script and not at all a prurient voyeuristic sop no siree. Very little is left to the imagination, though the movie is not at all gynecological.

The men in the story are a puzzler, with few of them being what I'd call in the same league as the women. How they ever hooked up is a bit of a stretch, but if you insist in living in a falling-down country manse in the middle of nowhere a girl must lower her standards a bit I suppose.

The kissing scenes could sometimes go a bit far in the ""show some tongue, love"" department, in an effort to convey unbridled lust.

Story-wise I'm not entirely certain what I just watched. I'm going to have to watch again to see which way I take the somewhat ambiguous ending.

Yes, the story could be tightened up as far as pacing goes, but I found myself wanting to see what was going to happen in the end so it can't have been so bad. And like I say, I need to see it again to properly assess the plot.

Which, given the beautiful leading ladies, will be no chore whatsoever.

The extras are an interview with each of the actresses, and trailers. The American trailer for Vampyres is truly stupid. So bad it's good.

Worth what I paid to see it.

But I'm pulling a star for the poor wording that led me to expect both a Blu-ray AND a DVD version (which would play in my laptop during my boring commute) and for the needless dubbing of both female parts (the actresses had no experience in dubbing work and the director had a very crowded production schedule so he used ""voice doubles""). During the softcore scenes the dubbed nature of the dialogue becomes obvious (which is why most directors elect to pump music over such action).",1463097600,2,2056,4.305699481865285

Other reviewers have provided good overviews of the plot so I will just add some remarks about the foresight of our two lovely vampires.  Their use of sharp objects suggests the slasher movies that would become big in the 1980's.  Their wild passion for each other foreshadows 1990's lesbian chic.  The way that they seemed to be devouring their victims is reminiscent of zombies, the ""in"" monsters of today.  Fran and Miriam could have had brilliant careers as trends forecasters.

They live in a moldering mansion (beautiful place) and make like they're hitch-hiking.  They pick up lusty guys, bring them back to their place, spend a torrid night getting-it-on with these idiots, and just before morning hits have themselves a hearty meal with the guy's blood.  The two vamps sometimes get-it-on with each other while the idiot lies there only half aware of what's going on.  Once the victim is dead they put the body back in his car and leave the vehicle off on the road where the cops will find it.  The authorities act like repeatedly finding a naked, bloody body in an undamaged car is just normal business on a normal day.  No one seems interested enough to investigate.  The film has some good atmosphere, especially the two women wandering the autumnal to wintery woods in dark cloaks.  They also seem to tolerate mild daylight.  Not great, because the film over focuses on sex, but not bad.  The two actresses are beautiful, especially brown-haired Marianne Morris.  The Blue-Underground DVD is excellent quality.

1074909,5,6305808066,"This is one of my favorite vampire films of all time.  Despite the title, I wasn't all that convinced that the main characters were vampires, though they shun daylight and drink blood.  There was something supernatural about them, however.  Fran does go into a comatose state.  Fran Miriam seem more engrossed with each other than drinking blood.  In fact, it seems their main goal is murder, aside from their insatiable love for each other.

Regardless, they fulfilled their purpose.  I thought their presence utterly fascinating.  Loved their look.  Dark, gothic, sexy, and mysterious.  They have star quality.  They were enormously mesmerizing.  And this is though the two lead actresses say very few lines.  They were actually dubbed in the film.  Still, the way they were emoting - well, I was convinced.

I have my own theory of how the story plays out.  For me, this story is not chronological, but backwards, and I think I know who ""killed"" them.  But there are some who insist that this story is told in a linear fashion, and Fran and Miriam are actually ghosts.

Loved the setting.  The foggy hills, the large house with its dark wine cellar.  Drank every bit of this deep rich atmosphere.

So it is hard for me to get too enthused about the entire film....The director was evidently on some sort of serious tranquilizers, because there a tons of scenes that are drawn out to the point of being pointless and annoying; a senior film student would be lucky to get just a passing grade regarding the pacing (i.e.- there is none)... Otherwise, the setting is lush and it is well used to create a proper mood, but if the young ladies were taken out I would give the whole project 1 Star; I will however stick with 3 Stars just because of Anulka and her girlfriend.  ;->

Shot in the magnificent English countryside, in a ravishing warm color
palette, this is a great film of erotic horror cinema.
Yes, the director really takes his time, to slowly develop the forlorn mood
of the story, and highlight most of the characters-even those of the victims.
The film's slow pace heightens the tension, until it becomes almost unbearable.
And then the violence finally breaks out, and it is even more shocking
and unexpected. The erotic scenes are not vulgar or pornographic,
but they are far more explicit than those in the other erotic horror masterpiece:

1075089,4,6305808066,"Okay, 1974's VAMPYRES admittedly has numerous nude scenes--full-frontal female nude scenes, in some cases--that were a prerequisite for the sexploitation horror pouring out of Europe in the 1970s. And yes, the two female players have hourglass figures, ample bosoms, and beautiful faces. However, this British indie film, directed by Spanish auteur Jos Ramn Larraz, has a cinematic aesthetic that makes it stand out above its contemporaries as a horror film of true quality. Larraz does a fantastic job of directing, working in close conjunction with cinematographer Harry Waxman to ensure that nearly every shot of every scene is a balanced, well-framed image. In keeping with the spooky atmosphere of the moldering English manor house and surrounding grounds used for location shooting, production designer Ken Bridgeman maintains the perfect ambiance throughout. And unlike many other buxom sexploitation actresses of the era, erotic stars Marianne Morris and Anulka (Dziubinska) can actually act, and they do a superb job in making the eponymous characters both scary and sympathetic.

In addition to the outstanding efforts of cast and crew, the tight, well-written script is refreshingly new--even from the vantage point of some thirty-five years hence. Avoiding the usual vampire clichs, these vamps are really more like ghosts who have some inexplicable but insatiable desire to feed on the blood of the living. They don't have fangs, they can tolerate moderate sunlight, and instead of resting in musty old caskets, they sleep in a wine cellar during the brightest of the daylight hours. They also can eat, drink liquids other than blood, and seem to genuinely enjoy sex. And they even sometimes have sympathy for their victims, a characteristic that may lead to their ultimate downfall.

The myth of the vampire has always been regarded as sexual in nature, especially the intimacy of the flesh-penetrating bite on the neck. VAMPYRES carries this metaphor to the extreme, with heterosexual vampiric coitus portrayed as an intensely passionate, rigorous event that includes feasting on the blood of the non-vampiric partner. And the eponymous characters in VAMPYRES don't gently suck from two pricks in the neck; in the midst of sexual passion, they tear open their victims and lap up the crimson liquid with ferocious, writhing pleasure.

In short, VAMPYRES is an excellent British erotic horror flick that is superior to most others from its era of origin, and it can even stand up against many straightforward, non-sexploitation horror films. It is well written, well acted, and has high production values throughout--and all this in spite of a low, low budget. Director Larraz and his co-scripters have take an idea that they could play for camp or sheer sexploitation and, instead, deliver a thought-provoking look at indiscriminate and promiscuous sex, physical obsession, and guilt. And on top of that, they still throw in lots of delicious T&A.

The blu-ray from Blue Underground is a great buy. Not only does it present a restored director's cut of this excellent film (transferred primarily from the original negatives), but it also has cool extras that include a feature-commentary track with director Jos Ramn Larraz and producer Brian Smedley-Aston, interviews with stars Marianne Morris and Anulka Dziubinska, the U.S. and European trailers, and more.

1075172,3,6305808066,"""Vampyres"" is a 1975 film starring Marianne Morris (born in London); Anulka Dziubinska (Playboy Playmate May 1973); Sally Faulkner (""Confessions of a Driving Instructor"" and 48 other movies and TV appearances); Murray Brown (had the role of Jonathan Harker in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" opposite Jack Palance); and Brian Deacon (born in Oxford, UK).  The premise is lonely men picking up a beautiful woman hitchhiker (sometimes 2 beautiful women hitchhikers), who has them take her back to her home, where she gets them drunk and then slowly kills them and drinks their blood.  There are two lovely vampire women, Marrianne and Anulka.  You get to see them both in the buff enough that you know Anulka doesn't have matching carpet and drapes.  Although Marianne is who most frequently shares her birthday suit with the camera, the spotlight stealing star of this film is Sally Faulkner, who makes me want to see much, much more of her.  The second most interesting thing about this film (other than Sally Faulkner) is the Oakley Court Hotel mansion located on Windsor Road, in Berkshire, United Kingdom.  That hotel still books guests today, and if I had the money and time, it would be wonderful to visit.  Seeing this film reminded me of the old guy I used to work with who had a subscription to Playboy, and another to National Geographic, because he said both magazines had wonderful pictures of beautiful places he'd never get to visit.  In ""Vampyres"" (1975), the acting is sub-poor, the dialogue seems to have been written by a monkey at a typewriter, and the volume is low to help make the sudden screaming by the victims, really stand out.  That probably doesn't matter to most guys though, since generally guys watch films like this with the sound off anyway (homina, homina, homina).  Worth owning; could have lived up to the hype a little better, but for 1975 vintage, this was a few tasty goblets of merlot and zinfandel.",1309478400,5,1930,4.8567073170731705

***** This blu-ray is the finally released uncensored version!

It's bloody good. It looks great in uncompressed 1080p. For an old underground movie, this hottness was far ahead of its time. Yes. It has about as much story as Mrs Pac Man--and a simular theme. But my understanding is that the hot vampire girls in this weren't even actresses, more like models. But they come across honest. Kind of like high class amateur pornography--which is hard to find on blu-ray. I think if all the Twilight girls were watching this instead of New Pose, the world would be a much more interesting place. In any case, don't check out Vampyres for the story or the horror or the action. Check it out for the FUN. Like my wife said, and it's true, this is a flick to watch with a hot girl whose pants are unbuttoned. Now I rented this hottness from my favorite mail-it-to-me blu-ray company, so I can't speak to its value as a purchase, but I'm glad I watched it once, and I can see my wife and me maybe watching it again some day. If I wasn't price-sensitive I would buy it new on blu. If you're  remotely interested, I encourage you to take a whack at it. This is the kind of movie Hollywood should be remaking. Give me some naked explicit lesbian vampire huge-boob movies in 3D! And then maybe I'll start going to the cineplex again. But if you still need a nudge and a wink, think of it like this, set the impressively-breasted naked lesbian vampires models aside, and look at it as Classic Film History.

The women in the title roles are easy on the eye, and their antics on scren may give male viewers pause the next time they see lady hitchhikers on the road. While the plights of Fran (Marianne Morris) and Miriam (Anulka) are never clearly explained, their onscreen seductions and violence perpetrated on male victims are such that it is hard to imagine anyone sleeping well after upon watching this movie.

1075261,4,6305808066,"It was the 1970s and the world was filled with movies that featured lesbian vampires. Jess Franco had one  called ""Vampyros Lesbos""; Rank Hammer Studios had their ""Vampire Lovers""; the art-house scene had ""Daughters of Darkness""; and the euro-trash scene had ""The Blood-Spattered Bride"". However, there was one movie of this genre that outdid them all: ""Vampyres"" This Anglo-Spanish production was interesting in that the vampires in the film, performed by the bewitchingly dark Marianne Morris, and the ethereally beautiful Anulka Dziubinska, are not presented as vampires. If anything, there is some question as to who or what these women are as they move like ghostly apparitions around their estate. As the story develops, a man (Murray Brown) encounters Morris' character by the roadside and it taken to her manor house. He is easily smitten by the women who eventually take him to their bed. Once they have him in a state of euphoria, they slowly feast on him. The scene is loaded with campy bloody gore and hot lesbian action. Later, a young married couple come into the manor, and they, too, fall prey to the vampyres. However, the women's lust and unquenchable thirst for blood leads them down the path of personal destruction. Sexploitation at its best, not to mention two of the hottest lesbian vampires to ever grace trash cinema, make this movie a cult delight.",1244332800,2,1374,5.0
1075262,4,6305808066,"""Vampyres"" is a cult classic and a landmark of erotic horror cinema.  It holds this status because it is a rarity: a sexploitation film whose quality actually rises well above ""barely watchable"".  In fact, it is quite marvelous in it's display of titillation, genuine terror, creepiness, and tension.  I could easily count on the fingers on one hand the vampire films that warrant a 5 star rating.  The only thing keeping this film from that hallowed pantheon is the complete and utter lack of a plot.  This is more of a journey into sex and violence then it is a complete story, but it is presented in such a way that there are few vampire films that surpass it for sheer enjoyment.

The title characters are two lesbian lovers who are gunned down in a mansion while in bed together in the opening scene.  We are then introduced to a couple traveling the countryside who pass by a pair of lovely hitchhikers on their way to set up camp in a trailer outside of the apparently abandoned mansion.  It also seems there is quite a rash of unusually brutal single-car accidents on the road.  As the film unfolds, we will see how each of the events we've seen are connected to that violent opening sequence.  In the meantime, the audience is treated to some of the most outstanding displays of sex and violence ever filmed.  The pace is surprisingly slow for a movie with so little meat to the story, but the tension, dread, and  mystery more than make up for it.  I suppose the moral of the story is the cliched ""don't pick up hitchhikers"", but no matter how many times I watch this and other horror tales with the same premise, I'm still picking up any who look like these girls.  Men are just dumb that way, I suppose.  But to be fair, among the limitless ways to meet thy maker, bitten to death by nude vampire girls has got to be at the top of my preferences.

Marriane Morris and Anulka Dziubinska (say that 5 times fast!) are without a doubt the most mesmerizing duo of onscreen vamps in cinema history.  And it's not just because they're nekkid a lot of the time.  Anulka's classic petite blonde beauty with her beaming smiles and Morris's dark sultry sexuality as she haughtily regards the victims with thinly-veiled contempt are an irresistible contrast.  The starlets along with Spanish director Jose Ramon Larraz's brash and uncompromising vision really help make a movie that should be average at best shine.  Nudity or no nudity, there is something truly unforgettable about the image of the two undead succubi wrapped in their capes hurrying through the woods and cemeteries in the early morning hours, rushing to their daytime resting place.  I can't put my finger on it, but it just strikes me as the definitive picture of female vampires.  ""Vampyres"" just has a mysterious and truly iconic distilled purity to it that makes it stand out among all of the other vampire films that have been made over the decades.

Over the years, this film has seen hell.  The older version I saw years ago was cut and surtitled ""Daughters of Darkness"", which is the name of a similarly-themed vampire film from around the same time. ""Daughters of Dracula"" is another surtitle that has been affixed to this film.  God, do I hate it when American releases do that.  They sure don't make tracking down classic foreign horror films easy.  In fact,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Daughters-of-Darkness/dp/B000HDR8E6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Daughters of Darkness</a>&nbsp;was the film I thought I was buying when I purchased this DVD recently.  But I'm happy now because seeing the uncut version of ""Vampyres"" for myself after all these years, I can safely say that it is easily the superior film of the two. It's small wonder that I wasn't all that impressed with ""Vampyres"" when most of the good stuff was left out of the cut I watched.  For some reason, it was actually cheaper for me to import the British DVD of this film, but for all intents and purposes, it appears that the region 1 & 2 releases are identical (aside from the baffling cover art on the import)  with some great bonus features.  The commentary is outstanding and Larraz is a very entertaining guy to listen to. There are also fantastic interviews with the stars -who are still quite beautiful to this day- plus two trailers and a ton of stills, including a reproduction of a brief deleted scene.

""Vampyres"" is arguably the most sexual quality vampire film that has ever been released.  It also features some of the most genuinely frightening kills in cinema history.  These qualities make this movie a must-own for fans of exploitation cinema.  The lack of a plot keeps it from a perfect rating, but everything else is topshelf.  Though the ending makes the film seem unfinished, it leaves you wanting much more and it does have a sardonic quality to it that makes it pleasing.  But I wish there were a sequel.",1236556800,3,4920,4.779881656804734

I could not believe how stupid the cops must of been a car wreck surely caused all the puncture and stab wounds on the victim.  I had this movie dead on from the start and nothing surprised me.  Be at bisexual or the bloody hunger kills this movie was not a fun watch.  That is basically it and I found myself unable to watch so I watched at 2x speed just to get through it.  I could still understand the dialogue since there are no subtitles and I really don't think I missed anything.  I know some people love this movie coming from the seventies and I understand but this movie from the reviews had me looking forward to watching it.  Thank goodness I only rented it since I was so disappointed in pretty much everything.  Its almost like they were trying to shock the audience with its content but I could be wrong about that.  I could not recommend this to anyone not b/c of the sexual content or the blood but simply because it just isn't that good.

1075264,4,6305808066,"Well, that's just not fair.
When you're driving down the road, the last thing on your mind is picking up a hitchhiker.  But then you realize the person is of the female variety.  So next, any red-blooded male instinctively checks to see how cute she is.  Uh-oh, she's sizzlin-fajita hot.  Plus, she's bearing some plump juicy cleavage?  AND she has a friend that's a boiling over beaut?!?!  Fahhhgettaboutit, that's game over.

Soooo, back to their place(30 seconds down the road).  You wanna talk about some sexual pressure.  The irresistable Fran practically begs you for the high hard one.  She even has the decency to ride you reverse cowgirl style(one of my top 80 favorite positions).  But you better hit that sweet spot, or she'll be munching (I'm not referring to carpet).

This is just an awesomely erotic and grotesque landmark cult classick.  Only from the 70's.  Watch these gorgeous bisexual vamps romp and suck during their nightly bloodlust orgies.  Highly recommended for the fellas.  4.5 stars.",1230681600,,1011,5.0

Employing the tried and tested trick of ugly-one-hides-in-the-bushes-while-fit-one-flashes-thigh-at-horny-motorist (only in this case, there is no ugly one), the two thirsty sirens of Joseph Larraz' pleasingly notorious 'Vampyres' enjoy an enviable success rate among the sideburn fizzogged wallies in their Lionels and bling. Luring them with innuendo to the trusty mansion house, there to suck the life-blood (and everything else!) out of them during delirious, hysterical orgies.

This pair make Caligula look coy - naked in seconds, frantic panting nymphs on a sanguinary frenzied night-ride, cutting a swathe through any stereotype 70's blockheads that come their way - and it's hard to be critical. Two beauties swirling down a dim country lane - heaving cleavage, diaphanous frocks. Thick bozo with torque for a brain and ludicrous hair and collars; yeah, they're gonna want YOU, plant-pot - nothing suspicious here at all.
You just know these guys are deserving everything they get - and they get plenty. You wonder who does the girlies' laundry - they'll also be getting plenty - of overtime.

'Vampyres' works it's low-budget suzzies off to be disturbing and disgusting. Some of the vigorous bedroom stuff is wince-inducing; soft-core lashing and thrashing inevitably leading to hardcore slashing and splashing, but you can't help feeling the fun.
Larraz is a no-frills film director, he simply gets it out and points it - and you just know you've got to look as 90 minutes solid of bods, bumps and bubbling blood unfold before you. It's a Stygian concept - a Spanish director making a British film - and he seems to grasp the moist perversity of the situation and stuff his film with it. He's got two gorgeous leads, mounds of unfettered heaving flesh and barrels of sexy, alluring O and A Positive - the guys a genius.

It all goes a bit pear-shaped when one of our succubine heroines falls in love with one of her victims and there's unwanted involvement by some interfering trailer-trash (and THAT'S how perverse Larraz is - people in a caravan are the heroes of this film!), but by then we're ready for the respite. There's just time to observe a pretentious wine expert get corked, followed by a nicely balanced plot-twist before we're stumbling over the slightly off-beat finishing line.

The wine-snob murder is great; I half expected my unrequiteds to swish him round their mouths, make grand exclamations about a hint of hundreds and thousands or a suggestion of recently unloaded banana before spitting him out on the floor. Perhaps it got lost in cutting.....

Make sure you get the dvd with the Larraz commentary - I usually avoid 'extras' like bruised haemorrhoids, but he's amusing, fascinating and he swears like a docker.",1229472000,,2991,5.056795131845842

1075406,2,6305808066,"I just watched it for the first time and I agree with some other reviewers that this was a film with awesome potential that did not live up to it.  I loved the landscape and the foreboding Victorian mansion. The foggy rural countryside felt so immediate!  The actresses were well suited to the film with their eerie, floating movements, and had good chemistry.

But I would have preferred a film with similarly great atmosphere that held together better and made more sense. As a previous reviewer noted, the leading man, Murray Brown, who plays ""Ted,"" is not really worthy of his special-ness. It makes little sense that the vampire Fran would take risks to keep Ted alive for sex when she has her beautiful girlfriend, Miriam to pleasure her at any time.  Maybe director Larraz identified with Ted, which is why he wrote the story so the character would live.

Also, I was disappointed that the couple staying in the camping trailer didn't ultimately play a more purposeful role.  They were introduced in a way as proxies for the viewer because they, too, are innocently wondering about all the strange things which keep happening around them.  The female of the couple, played by Sally Faulkner, is particularly intent on piecing together the mystery.  She is very likeable as a sensitive, curious person.

Fran (Marianne Morris) and Miriam (Anulka), the vamp protagonists of Larraz's ""Vampyres,"" embody these essential qualities: they are dead, in love with each other, sexually active (and how!), and endowed with the sublime beauty characteristic of supernatural raptors.  Of course their sanguinary habits provide an added enticement--a kind of icing on the macabre cake! Indeed nothing says Gothic Elegance like knife-wielding revenants ensconced in an English manor...
  These unusual Heroines ask for more than acceptance: they require a viewer's admiration, adoration.

1075409,4,6305808066,"I rate vampire/horror movies as great, bad and terrible. ""Bad"" horror films can be a lot of fun with their unintentional goofs and silly occurrences. Great movies are rarely the low budget Hammer-type films, and terrible is simply that...terrible.

Vampyres falls somewhere in between great and bad to my surprise. The chemistry of the actors was superb, the vampyres always seemed to have a good time and there were some great sex scenes. The violence was pitched just right, and there was some creativity such as eschewing the traditional neck-biting for sliced bloodletting, the vampyres enjoying sex, wine and even a cigarette.

Unfortunately, the ""moldering"" castle looked like new to me, and the camping couple nearby was a bit annoying. Who would go camping in a tiny trailer near the castle, then sit and polish the silver?

However, another refreshing detail of this film was the lovely nude actresses had genuine breasts! Not something you see much of anymore. Get it guys? [...]

I recently had the opportunity to view the 1974 cult classic ""Vampyres"" starring Marianne Morris (Fran) and Anulka (Miriam). The film opens up with a bang when the two lovers Fran and Miriam are gunned down by an unseen stranger. Fran and Miriam ends up as blood-drinking spirits who are able to walk into the sun light and live, eat and drink, and enjoy other pleasures that mortal humans enjoys. The two women lure unsuspecting men back to their home for a night of sex and blood. There really isn't much of a storyline in this film other than Fran seduces and falls for a driver named Ted. Miriam warns Fran that keeping Ted around would lead to their downfall and that she needs to dispose of him as soon as possible. In the film, there is a couple John (Brian Deacon) and Harriet (Sally Faulkner) who are camping and has a brief encounter with the women from afar. They are kind of a distraction and almost useless in the film. They are just there which I found rather annoying. I could have lived without them in the film. After seeing the 14 minute interview with Marianne Morris and Anulka, I learned that the film was dubbed. In Marianne's case, the dub over was awful but I would not have guessed that Anulka's voice was dubbed over. The voiceover for Anulka was more natural while Marianne's was over the top and just atrocious. The writing was thin and the dialogue was corny and unintentionally funny nevertheless I actually enjoyed this cult classic.

The sets were only mediocre, consisting of a mixture of the gothic and 70's kitsch.  The film's saving grace was the acting and dialog, which for the most part were not too bad.

1075412,5,6305808066,"Some time ago I made a statement to the effect that I avoided vampire films like the plague. What did I do immediately after making such a pronouncement? Why, I went right out and started watching vampire films! I am nothing if not a huge hypocrite, but at least this time there is a reason for my hypocrisy. You see, I am finally getting a chance to see all the great Eurohorror classics thanks to the advent of DVD. And it just so happens that some of these great classics employ the tried and true vampire theme. How could I pass up the joy that is ""Daughters of Darkness"" merely because I try to avoid vampire films? Or Jose Larraz's epic ""Vampyres""? Actually, I never even heard of this last movie before DVD arrived on the scene. I was thumbing through the lists of supposed Eurohorror classics and stumbled over the title. The word on it was good, great in some instances, so I decided to give it a shot. I'm glad I did. In fact, if I had to cite one example of a movie that embodied the look and feel of 1970s Eurohorror, I would pick ""Vampyres."" The only thing missing from Larraz's film is an extremely high gore quotient (the film is quite bloody, though).

Fran (Marianne Morris) and her blonde partner Miriam (Anulka) are just your average, everyday dead spirits wandering through rain shrouded cemeteries, back roads, and dark forests somewhere in England. We learn at the beginning of the film that someone, presumably a male, expressed his disappointment at finding the two young women in a compromising position and thus shot them with a handgun. Flash forward some number of years to a creepy looking castle located out in the sticks, the same castle where the aforementioned crime took place. Miriam and Fran, clad in flowing robes, flit from their abode to the roadside where they entice young male drivers back to the castle for an evening of wine, fun, and other assorted activities. Later, we see the police prying these hapless wretches from their wrecked cars, drained of blood and with watches that mysteriously stopped. Hmmm. Looks like something decidedly supernatural is going on in the vicinity. Could the accidents have something to do with our two wayward spirits? It sure looks like it, especially considering the last time we see these blokes alive is in the company of Fran and Miriam.

Enter three people who will soon learn more than they ever wanted to know about young, gorgeous spirit vampires. There's a driver, Ted (Murray Brown), who accepts an invitation from Fran to return to the castle only to find himself imprisoned there as a sort of ongoing snack for the voracious cutie. Then we meet a couple of campers, John (Brian Deacon) and his girl Harriet (Sally Faulkner), who set up their little trailer on the grounds of the supposedly empty castle. Camping out on the site where a couple of vampires ply their trade isn't a good idea, and it isn't too long before both John and Harriet experience several frightening up close and personal encounters with Fran and Miriam. They even have a run in with Ted, without knowing he's an unwilling participant in the festivities going on in the house, but his sudden presence along with his ghostly pallor greatly alarms our campers. Meanwhile, Miriam warns Fran that her irrational love--for lack of a better term--for Ted endangers their presence in the castle and their highway activities. Fran persists in keeping Ted around, however, and will pay a price for doing so. Maybe. O.k., she doesn't pay as much of a price as John, Harriet, Ted, and a few other sorry souls do. Spending any time at all around these vampires is extraordinarily bad for one's health.

Forget about performances or the occasional bloodshed in ""Vampyres."" This is a movie where the atmosphere takes center stage. Every image reeks of doom and gloom, from the forbidding castle to the rain and fog shrouded environs to the massively haunting musical score. I mentioned earlier that ""Vampyres"" could serve as an archetype of the Eurohorror phenomenon of the 1970s, and one need look no further than the scenes where Miriam and Fran run soundlessly through a decrepit cemetery on their frequent jaunts to the road as proof of this assertion. Anyone writing a book about the prime years of European horror films should use a still taken from these scenes for the cover. ""Vampyres"" isn't all about atmosphere, though. There is also an enormous amount of erotic imagery in the movie, imagery made all the more impressive considering the beautiful visages of Marianne Morris and Anulka. These are two incredibly attractive women who, despite the atrocious dubbing in the case of Morris, really help propel the plot. When you've got a film about two beautiful young ladies turned into spiritual vampires, it helps to cast two beautiful young ladies in the respective parts. European horror films are known for casting attractive women (see Edwige Fenech, Uschi Digard, Christina Lindberg, etc.), but Larraz really went above and beyond the call of duty here.

Once again, Blue Underground went overboard on the extras for ""Vampyres."" Interviews with Marianne Morris and Anulka grace the disc, along with a commentary track with director Jose Larraz. Too, the disc throws in a few funky trailers as well as a reconstruction of a lost scene through still photographs. The picture and audio look and sound great. I heartily recommend ""Vampyres"" for anyone interested in learning about Eurohorror. I would think fans of vampire films already know about this one, but they should definitely check it out if they haven't heard about it.",1106352000,13,5589,4.849214659685864
1075413,4,6305808066,"Well, after literally decades of hearing tales of the notoriety of this film and seeing the most highly titillating stills from it prominently featured in my vampire movie books, I finally took the ""daring"" plunge and actually sought it out and watched it. -- And my opinion of it? Well I dunno, maybe I've been letting my naughty imagination get the best of me all these years or maybe my moral standards are especially low, but my reaction was kind of ""oh, is that all there was to it?""

For all the hubbub, I was actually expecting there to be much more sex, violence and gore than there turned out to be. By today's standards, I actually found it quite tame. Yes, there is a lot of nudity in it, but none of it is of the full-frontal variety showing the genital area. What simulated coitus there is, is neither particularly graphic nor convincing. And the worst of the film's violence all occurs off-screen. Granted, if you find lots and lots of fake blood scary, you MAY get a chill or two. But heck, these vamps don't even have FANGS fer cryin' out loud!

Anulka doesn't really have to act much, just stand/lie there and look pretty. Marianne Morris does do a bit more and does make an adequate female vamp. And the much-hyped lesbian scenes are also quite limited and nothing particularly special by today's standards.

What I did like very much was the ambience that the wonderful locations of the manor house and the English countryside in autumn give to the film. I would say that it was this, and also the tasteful direction which shows a nice appreciation for the value of quiet and silence, which combine with the actors to create a film a bit better than adequate.

Overall I'd rate this movie a bit better than 3.5 stars, and thanks to the outstanding job they have done on this DVD I have no problems with bumping it up to a full 4 stars. Not only does the film look fabulously and immaculately restored, but the extras are also good. The best part was the 15-minute interview segment with the actresses today. I would say that Anulka Dziubinska looks even hotter today, some 30 years later. -- No small feat, and certainly a very rare occurrence!

You also get a commentary from the director and the producer of the film, as well as a still gallery of a missing scene, an Anulka modelling career still gallery, plus the usual trailer, and even a computer file version of the classic but out of print book on this film. All in all, a wonderful package. Blue Underground deserve to be very proud of the excellent job they have done on this DVD. It's great to see a classic B-movie like this given the proper respect it deserves.

As for me, well I guess I'm still in the market for a lesbian vampire flick which lives up to the expectations I've created in my head all these years. (Attention, filmmakers....!) What I'm looking for is something more extreme and graphic than this, but still without the yucky tackiness of porn and with the polished production values and great atmosphere of this film. (--Yeah I know about the Donald Glut videos, but I said WITH production values.) So the market is out here, folks. Now let's see what you can do.

(UK - 1974)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

A motorist (Murray Brown) is lured to an isolated country house inhabited by two beautiful young women (Marianne Morris and Anulka) and becomes enmeshed in their free-spirited sexual lifestyle, but his hosts turn out to be vampires with a frenzied thirst for human blood...

Taking its cue from the lesbian vampire cycle initiated by maverick director Jean Rollin in France, and consolidated by the success of Hammer's 'Carmilla' series in the UK, Jose Ramon Larraz' daring shocker VAMPYRES pushed the concept of Adult Horror much further than British censors were prepared to tolerate in 1974, and his film was cut by almost three minutes on its original British release. It isn't difficult to see why! Using its Gothic theme as the pretext for as much nudity, sex and bloodshed as the film's short running time will allow, Larraz (who wrote the screenplay under the pseudonym 'D. Daubeney') uses these commercial elements as mere backdrop to a languid meditation on life, death and the impulses - sexual and otherwise - which affirm the human condition.

Shot on location at a picturesque country house during the Autumn of 1973, Harry Waxman's haunting cinematography conjures an atmosphere of grim foreboding, in which the desolate countryside - bleak and beautiful in equal measure - seems to foreshadow a whirlwind of impending horror (Larraz pulled a similar trick earlier the same year with SYMPTOMS, a low-key thriller which is all mood and very little action, until it erupts into a frenzy of violence during the final reel).

However, despite its pretensions, VAMPYRES' wafer-thin plot and rough-hewn production values don't really amount to very much, and while the two female protagonists are as charismatic and appealing as could be wished, the male lead (Brown, past his prime at the time of filming) is woefully miscast in a role that should have gone to some beautiful, twentysomething stud. A must-see item for cult movie fans, an amusing curio for everyone else, VAMPYRES is an acquired taste. Watch out for Bessie Love, star of the silent era, in a brief cameo at the end of the movie.",1077494400,10,2178,5.052924791086351
1075499,4,6305808066,"Okay, 1974's VAMPYRES admittedly has numerous nude scenes--full frontal female nude scenes, in some cases--that was a prerequisite for the sexploitation horror pouring out of Europe in the 1970s.  And yes, the two female players have hourglass figures, ample bosoms, and beautiful faces.  However, this British indie film, directed by Spanish auteur Jos Ramn Larraz, has a cinematic aesthetic that makes it stand out above its contemporaries as a horror film of true quality.  Larraz does a fantastic job of directing, working in close conjunction with cinematographer Harry Waxman to ensure that nearly every shot of every scene is a balanced, well-framed image.  In keeping with the spooky atmosphere of the moldering English manor house and surrounding grounds used for location shooting, production designer Ken Bridgeman maintains the perfect ambiance throughout.  And unlike many other buxom sexploitation actresses of the era, erotic stars Marianne Morris and Anulka (Dziubinska) can actually act, and they do a superb job in making the eponymous characters both scary and sympathetic.
In addition to the outstanding efforts of cast and crew, the tight, well-written script is refreshingly new--even from this vantage point of some thirty years hence.  Avoiding the usual vampire clichs, these VAMPYRES are really more like ghosts who have some inexplicable but insatiable desire to feed on the blood of the living.  They don't have fangs, they can tolerate moderate sunlight, and instead of resting in musty old caskets, they sleep in a wine cellar during the brightest of the daylight hours.  They also can eat, drink liquids other than blood, and seem to genuinely enjoy sex.  And they even sometimes have sympathy for their victims, a characteristic that may lead to their ultimate downfall.
The myth of the vampire has always been regarded as sexual in nature, especially the intimacy of the flesh-penetrating bite on the neck. VAMPYRES carries this metaphor to the extreme, with heterosexual vampiric coitus portrayed as an intensely passionate, rigorous event that includes feasting on the blood of the non-vampiric partner. And the eponymous characters in VAMPYRES don't gently suck from two pricks in the neck; in the midst of sexual passion, they tear open their victims and lap up the crimson liquid with ferocious, writhing pleasure.
In short, VAMPYRES is an excellent British erotic horror flick that is superior to most others from its era of origin, and it can even stand up against many straightforward, non-sexploitation horror films.  It is well written, well acted, and has high production values throughout--and all this in spite of a low, low budget.  Director Larraz and his co-scripters have take an idea that they could play for camp or sheer sexploitation and, instead, deliver a thought-provoking look at indiscriminate and promiscuous sex, physical obsession, and guilt.  And on top of that, they still throw in lots of delicious T&A.
The DVD from Blue Underground is a great buy.  Not only does it present a widescreen restored director's version of this excellent film--transferred primarily from the original negatives--but it also has lots of cool extras.  It offers a feature-commentary track with director Jos Ramn Larraz and producer Brian Smedley-Aston that is both hilarious--due to Larraz's frank use of English colloquialisms--and informative.  And there are also recent interviews with Marianne Morris and Anulka Dziubinska, the film's beautiful stars; a lost scene recreated via production stills; U.S. and European trailers; and more.  This is a piece of erotic artistic cinematic history that any serious horror fans will want to add to their collections.",1076976000,63,3704,5.360344827586207
1075500,5,6305808066,"Ever since I read about this movie in a British horror magazine I wanted to watch it. And finally - it was released by Blue Underground on DVD, for the first time ever uncut (a former DVD release missed about 30 seconds of footage, former videotape releases were even more cut, totalling sometimes up to three minutes) Needless to say I ordered it. And I was not disappointed.
VAMYPRES is undoubtedly the best erotic horror movie ever committed to celluloid. The plot concerns two VERY sexy female vampires, mysterious, ample Fran (Marianne MORRIS) and the blonde, more fragile Miriam (ANULKA). They are unusual vampires: daylight does not harm them and they do not have fangs. At dawn the duo leaves their rundown castle (a really beautiful and very gothic building), ask male motorists for a lift and invite them to their castle for vine and sex. After killing them and feasting on their hapless victims' blood, the bloodsucking duo deposes of the corpses in staged car accidents. (Wouldn't so many traffic accidents within such a small area arouse suspicion? Okay, okay, I admit, I'm nitpicking here.) One of Fran's victims, Ted, awakens in the castle after a night of lovemaking and boozing, to find his arm severely cut. He thinks he hurt himself with a shade of glass the other night due to his inebriation. (Contrary to her usual habit, Fran did not kill Ted immediately.) Ted gets weaker and weaker and though he gets increasingly suspicious, finds himself unable to leave the castle, because he fell for Fran (small wonder!)
All the while, a young couple holidays outside the castle in their caravan, and the wife gets increasingly nervous about the strange duo of women...
Will Ted survive? Will the young couple be able to uncover the dark secret of the castle?
Well, watch for yourself... I won't give it away, but let me assure you that you won't be disappointed.
VAMPYRES will be enjoyed by any fan of horror movies for a large number of reasons. Firstly and most importantly, VAMPYRES is super ultra sexy!!! Rarely did I see an actress with the outstanding good looks and sex appeal of Marianne MORRIS. And there is lots and lots of nudity and (surprisingly graphic) sex in the film! The script provides many opportunities for the vampires to appear in the nude.
Secondly, there is enough bloodshed to appeal to horror fans. However VAMPYRES does not entirely rely on sex and violence to keep you entertained, it is also beautifully shot, exceptionally well written and with the mood and feel of a vampire film of the well-known HAMMER studios. The castle and the autumn season, during which VAMPYRES was shot, add immensely to the gothic feeling.
As is appropriate for an outstanding movie, Blue Underground's DVD presentation is very impressive. The film is presented in the correct widescreen aspect ratio of 1.85 : 1 and offers a lot of extras. There is a 14 minute interview with the lead actresses Marianne MORRIS and ANULKA. Despite being in their early 50ies by now, both (and MORRIS in particular) still look very good today. Both comment on the film shot, provide anectodes about the director, reveal how they felt during the more lascivious scenes and remark on their further live post VAMPYRES. (It is a shame that MORRIS did not pursue her acting career after this film, but opened a refurbishing company instead.) Both are proud of their participation in VAMPYRES.
There are also two trailers, the international one and the US trailer. Both are very good, with the US having the advantage, but unfortunately give away too many highlights.
Another interesting feature is a recreation of a scene, which did not made it in the final cut. The footage is now lost, so some stills give you an impression of the scene.
There are also very extensive picture galleries with interesting behind-the-scenes photoes, promotional material and stills from the film (including many nudity stills). And there is a socalled ANULKA glamour gallery (actress ANULKA was photomodel before and after her lead role in VAMPYRES) There are scores of pictures to watch!
Also included is a rather short biography and filmography of director Jose Ramon LARRAZ.
There is even a small poster of the Italian version of VAMPYRES in the keepcase.
Believe my raving and buy this DVD! I'm sure, you'll like it as much as I do!",1063411200,9,4319,4.869565217391305
1075501,4,6305808066,"I was a kid in the 1970s and loved horror movies.  I watched a lot of late night creature features and read every book on horror films I could find.  The books normally included a photo from VAMPYRES but my chance of ever seeing it were beyond remote at the time.  From what I read then, I could see that the film was the next logical progression after watching Hammer Films and reading Vampirella comics at the time: blood-soaked lesbians out of control!
So, when I found a DVD version I could order through Amazon, I bought it.  I think waiting so long to see it has really helped.  Very Seventies!  The music definitely took me back by mixing spooky organ music with electric guitars.  The girls were (and still are!) very sexy.  I really appreciated the interviews with them now.
I would definitely recommend this to any horror fan, especially of the 1970s.  (Not for kids though--even by today's standards, I found this a very erotic film).",1063411200,,945,4.5773809523809526
1075502,5,6305808066,"Make no mistake this film is a cult classic along side the other female vampire film Vamyros Lesbos. It is bloody and sexy and fun.
Other reviews have done a great job of describing the film but one point about the DVD releases, while AnchorBay does a great job on plenty of Fulci titles they dropped the ball with their Vampyres DVD as it is actually slightly cut. Get the Blue Underground DVD as it is uncut and has some remakable special features.",1057708800,8,450,4.433734939759036
1075503,5,6305808066,"For those already familiar with the film: I decided to trade in my Anchor Bay copy of Vampyres and get the Blue Underground edition, and I'm glad I did.  The lost Caravan scene which Anchor Bay's edition does not contain only consists of about 10 photos of lost footage which doesn't look like it would have added anything to the movie.  And Blue Underground's copy only less than half a minute of extra footage in the film itself which is not found in the Anchor Bay edition, and this only consists of additional violence (the scene where a couple gets killed in their car).  These alone are nice but not really worth the trade.  But what makes the Blue Underground version really superior is: 1) a fun new interview with both Vampyres (and they still look great!), 2) tons of poster art and promotional material from around the world, and 3) a book about the film on DVD-Rom.  And there are other nice little touches, like a better choice of artwork for the chapter list sheet, which all adds up to make me even happier with this edition.
For those who have never seen this film: This is one of the best vampire films ever made, and is quite superior to any of the Hammer films, but be forewarned that the reason why it isn't as widely recognized as a classic as it should be is because it is a rather shocking film.  But what makes this movie particularly disturbing and effective is that the vampyres do not seem supernatural at all (except for their aversion to daylight). These vampyres messily tear people open with their teeth, like animals, when they drink blood instead of just cleanly sucking it out, which is something any psycho could do. But what makes them really effective is that they are not really ""evil"", but instead seem like two ordinary women who have freed themselves from all restrictions and willingly give in to the primal, animalistic urges which all people suppress to some extent.  They are simultaneously greatly attractive and absolutely repulsive in their freedom.  And unlike Christopher Lee's or Bela Lugosi's Dracula, they don't seem to act civil only as an act, but seem to actually enjoy the company of their victims.  You will hate yourself for liking them so much.  The usual one-dimensional Hollywood monster is far less effective, even with all the expensive makeup and visual effects.",1056499200,4,2327,4.70935960591133
1075504,4,6305808066,"Where to begin.....
As far as an erotic vampire movie goes, look no further. As far as a savage and gory vampire movie goes, look no further. As far as an interesting story goes with great cinematography to boot, look no further.
This movie came out in 1974 and had to be edited by the censors for release in most countries. The footage that had been cut has been put back in for this excellent dvd release from Anchor Bay. It was directed by Spanish director Joseph Larraz and filmed in England on Hammer Studios sets.
The story goes something like this:
Two women are making love in a bed and someone walks in on them and shoots them. Next thing we know a man (Murray Brown) is driving through the countryside and picks up a woman (Marianne Morris) along the road. They go to her place which just happens to be a huge manor home in the middle of nowhere. They end up having sex and the next thing he know it is next morning. He feels weak and notices a nasty cut on his arm and the girl is nowhere to be found. He gets in his car a drives a little ways along the dirt road leading out of the estate when he runs across a couple who have picked this site to park their trailer and go camping. They help the man bandage his cut and after a little while he leaves. He runs across the strange woman he picked up the night before and they go back to the estate. Her friend (Anulka Dziubinska) has picked up another man and before too long the two couples have made their way to the bedrooms. The first man makes love to the woman but this time we see her sucking blood out of the cut on his arm. Her friend walks in and they go to the other bedroom where he lover is lying face up up on the bed covered in blood. They both start an orgiastic feast on the man and when they are done they drag him out of the room.
The next morning the first man wakes up and and makes his way to the highway in his car when he slows down for a car wreck along the road. The bloody body behind the wheel is the man he had seen at the house the prior evening. He drives back to the estate and starts wandering around and winds up getting locked in the cellar. The girls return, find and release him, and he goes back up to the bedroom.
Meanwhile, while all of this has been going on, the woman on vacation in the trailer has become terribly interested in the goings on at the estate and keeps trying to get her husband interested. He feels it is none of their business and is content to go fishing and wishes his wife would just be happy with her paintings that she has been working on.
That night, the girls at the estate bring home another man they picked up and they end up going down to the wine cellar. Before too long he is a bloody mess and the first man has now left and made his way to the trailer.
The couple in the trailer are horrified to see the condition that the man is in so the husband goes out to the car to go get help. Before he can take off the women attack him in the car and kill him. The wife goes out to check on him and starts screaming when she sees his bloody body in the car. The two women then attack the wife and she is dragged, kicking and screaming, back to the cellar where they strip her and then feast on her.
I have probably given away too much, but I won't give away the ending. I have read that some people thought the end was stupid and some people liked it. I happened to have liked it a lot. This is a pretty unique vampire movie and it is too bad it didn't do better at the box office, maybe then we would have had a sequel! ...",1034812800,11,3548,4.01980198019802
1075505,3,6305808066,"VAMPYRES is a very graphic, bloody, & sexy horror film. It owes a lot of its success to the two beautiful female leads Anulka & Marianne Morris. The movie is beautifully shot, with bleeding colors, & shows beautiful scenery. It's aslo very suspenseful at times. Yet it's the logic of the story that is flawed. In one scene, the two vampires confront Harriet (Sally Faulkner) & say some sort of incantation as if Fran (Marianne Morris) knew her from a previous life. This was not touched upon later on before the movie ended with the possibility that it could have been just a dream.
I thought that the movie had a lot of potential, but the flawed narrative of the story holds the movie back. The movie has a dream-like feel to it. Maybe it was all a dream, maybe it isn't.",1029196800,4,772,4.443661971830986

It is a vampire movie and the acting it not terrible.
It has a spooky old mansion/castle.
Plenty more nudity and some lesbian theme, but not the cheesy teeny-bopper summer flick style.
Set in the English countryside (?).  I like  old schoool settings.

The minuses:  Not much in the way of a plot.
No fangs that I noticed.
Like many horror movies you wind up talking to the victim wondering why he hasn't already left.
Not much character development.  Who are these vamps and why are they here?
No special powers; no hypnosis, no changelings, no flying, no super strength, and no super senses.
They simply seduce their victims by talking directly to their cock.  There should be more of that in real life.
The ending is quick and sudden and unsatisfying.  (Your girlfriends know what that is like.)

I love the vampire genre and this was just good enough to watch it all the way through and say I have seen it.  That is about the sum of it.
