8605799,4,B00EIPKKCQ,"For fans of the series they will enjoy it. The kids at Pine Hollow are a bit older but find themselves working to save the barn. Characters act just as you suspect. Not as good as earlier in the series but worth watching. If you haven't seen the series it is fantastic. Start with earlier ones, not this one.",1453507200,,308,4.237288135593221
8605800,5,B00EIPKKCQ,"This movie really cheered me up!  It's a fun story, and there's lots of good lessons learned as well, as the characters go through many ups and downs.  Lots of feelings shared, lots of horses to look at, and a very positive and happy ending.",1418774400,,241,4.333333333333333

8605802,5,B00EIPKKCQ,My daughter has pretty much the complete collection of the show.  She has been waiting to get this one.  The series is just wonderful for young girls who likes horses and is into the whole English riding and stable adventure. The show is very nice to watch because I have watched some of it with my daughter just to see what the show is all about.  It is a very nice series and I recommend it very much but the viewer has to like this sort of show. It is really geared for a particular type of audience not to say that any one who is not into this whole English thing may not find it enjoyable to watch.,1399334400,2,603,4.050420168067227
8605803,4,B00EIPKKCQ,"This catches and keeps my daughter's attention, not something so easily done.  Good story line, characters are realistic and there are good morals being taught.",1390867200,2,160,5.4
