7759194,4,B01G9CFSSQ,"Over all, I liked the films.  I've been a Charlie Chan fan since I was a kid and watched them on various late night movies.  With the receipt of these three movies I, like a great many other fans, now own DVD copies of all known Charlie Chan films in existence, including the T.V. series which starred J. Carroll Naish.  After viewing all three movies, I can also say that I found the prints to be good quality.

The one reason that I did not give this 5 stars is because while the first DVD containing ""The Red Dragon"" played perfectly in my DVD player, the second disk would not.  I continually received an ""Incorrect Disk"" icon on my T.V. screen when I attempted to watch it.  The disk does, however, play perfectly on my laptop computer.",1465430400,23,741,4.372262773722627

7759210,4,B01G9CFSSQ,"Charlie Chan in the Sky Dragon

An airplane flies in the sky. The captain says hello to passengers Charlie Chan and Lee. [Note the men wearing hats.] Coffee keeps the passengers awake on long flights. Lee discovers a problem among the pilots and passengers! Lee takes control of the airplane, Charlie wakes up the passengers. Money is missing! They call for medical and police assistance when they land. The police order the passengers to take their original seats, they will photograph and fingerprint everyone. They are all questioned at police headquarters. They are searching for the money dropped overboard. Charlie will look into the case. The scene shifts to the theater where Miss La Fern dances on stage. Lee and Birmingham Brown watch in the alley, then enter a window. They find a body on the floor! Lt. Mike chases a man and catches him. Morton is charged with murder.

Charlie visits Mr. Smiths apartment, he knows his true identity. A woman visits Charlie Chan to provide information. Mr. Smith visits Charlies home, there is a shooting! Charlie and Lee search marriage records in many counties to find the location. A man follows them, assaults the JP, and burns the files! But another ledger has a clue. Can they locate a picture of Connie Jackson? Yes, it is Marie Fern the airline stewardess. Charlie calls Lt. Mike Roark to tell him the news. Later the police bring the passengers back to the airplane and place them in their original seats. Who of the four drugged the coffee? One of them is pointed out by a bandaged pilot, a person draws a pistol, but is stopped by a shot! Charlie employed a ruse to get an admission. Charlie then explains his theory and tells what a search found. There is another admission of guilt. But one guilty party pilots the airplane and plans to crash it after he parachutes out! The passengers overpower him, the pilot takes over to land it. Lee Chan helps.

The limited scenery tells of its lower budget. It is a good story with a surprising ending. The use of an airplane as the site for a locked room mystery must be original. There are fewer comic scenes in the movies of Roland Winters. This was the last of the series. Perhaps a declining audience put an end to the series? The rise of television later put an end to many movie theaters.",1487203200,,2294,4.645320197044335

In buying these extra videos with Roland Winters I now have all of his too. Roland Winters was a good actor and I saw him in many other roles, but to me Sidney was the Chan character.

7759241,5,B01G9CFSSQ,"Three of the lesser appreciated films in the Charlie Chan series are offered in this final collection.  Each film is just a little over 60 minutes.  The first film is The Red Dragon (1946).  Charlie Chan (Sidney Toler) is in Mexico with his son and Chattanooga Brown (Willie Best) when a murder occurs.  Plans for a bomb go missing along with a typewriter.  There are far too many suspects caught standing over the first body.  The second film is The Feathered Serpent (1948).  This time Charlie Chan (Roland Winters) is in Mexico caught up in a missing person case that also involves treasure.  He rambles around the desert looking for clues with two of his dimwitted sons (Keye Luke and Victor Sen Yung).  Theres more bumbling than intrigue thanks to sidekick Birmingham Brown (Mantan Moreland).  The final film is The Sky Dragon (1949) and it stars Roland Winters as Charlie Chan.  This time he and his son (Keye Luke) are on a plane when everyone on-board is drugged and the plane is left on autopilot.  Money goes missing and there are several suspicious people with a lot of good motives.

I bought this set to complete my Charlie Chan film collection.  The film transfer is quite nice.  I enjoyed all three films but especially The Feathered Serpent.  Some critics hated them, I don't see why.",1474588800,5,1300,4.711111111111111

movies that I have: it was easier to just open the cases and count the DVDs! I counted 25 of them, and wrote a QUICK review. Amazon hated it, and refused
to publish it... but that worked out just fine. I, soon, found another 16 'Chan DVDs. That's forty-one, total, DVDs. SOME of the discs have two movies on
them, but, most do not. I'd guess that I have [at least] F-I-F-T-Y of the movies. I was browsing through a rather lengthy, detailed, review that COULD have
saved me a lot of money. Turns out that TO g-e-t a complete collection, you'll have a duplicate movie---here and there--- so,I tightened-up my shelf space
and put the movies---as best I could, chronilogically---in some, 12-DVD, empty cases... except one that had 4 DVDs in a nice ""gate-folding"" case.
Yeah, I know, for the sake of SPACE I got rid of a bunch of cases a-n-d wrapper-liner-notes. But, there just had to be some RELIEF! I'll add this cut'n'paste, excerpt from Wiki' to show you how COMPLICATED collecting Charlie Chan CAN be. I had NO INTENTION of collecting for profit... just CONVENIENCE!
=====> "" Over 48 films featuring Charlie Chan were made, beginning in 1926. The character was first portrayed by East Asian actors, but, met with little success. In 1931, the Fox Film Corporation cast Swedish actor Warner Oland as Chan in Charlie ""Chan Carries On""; the film became popular, and Fox went on to produce 15 more Chan films with Oland in the title role. After Oland's death, American actor Sidney Toler was cast as Chan; Toler made 22 Chan films, first for Fox and then for Monogram Studios. After Toler's death, 6 films were made, starring Roland Winters. Film adaptations in the 1990s were poorly received. Charlie Chan's been in several radio programs, 2 TV shows, and comics.  "" <=====

The Hopalong Cassidy and Bowery Boys collections are delightful as well, though more compact... and, uh, economical.

* THE LOST WARNER OLAND FILMS:
Apparently all prints and negatives of four films were destroyed in a warehouse fire in 1937.
Through some fancy footwork, Warner Video has been able to bring three of them back to life:

--- ""Charlie Chan Carries On"" (1931)
Simultaneously with this lost film, a Spanish-language version was filmed using the same sets and costumes:
""Eran trece"" (""There Were Thirteen"") starring MANUEL ARBO (photo 3) as Charlie Chan.
It's in VOLUME 1 with English subtitles (coupled with ""Charlie Chan in Shanghai"")

--- ""Charlie Chan's Chance"" (1932) and ""Charlie Chan's Courage"" (1934)
Warner Video cleverly reproduced these lost films using voice actors, the original screenplay, still photos and music. Sort of like a one hour radio show with illustrations:
""Charlie Chan's Chance"" is in VOLUME 3 (coupled with ""The Black Camel"")
""Charlie Chan's Courage"" is in VOLUME 4 (coupled with ""Charlie Chan in Honolulu"")
Too bad they didn't do the same with ""Charlie Chan's Greatest Case"" (1933)

CHARLIE CHAN'S ASSISTANTS
Beginning with the eighth film (""Charlie Chan in Paris""), the series introduced various family members to assist their father in crime-solving.
Over the next fifteen years, four sons and two daughters fulfilled this role, all played by Chinese-American actors:
1) Lee = ten films (Keye Luke)
2) Jimmy = thirteen films (Sen Yung - later billed as Victor Sen Yung)
3) Tommy = eleven films (Benson Fong or Sen Yung)
4) Eddie = one film (Edwin Luke)
5) Iris = one film (Marianne Quon )
6) Frances = one film (Frances Chan - her actual name)

For a breakdown of the films that each family member was in (also details about Birmingham Brown)

8762690,3,B01G9CFSSQ,"I LOVE Charlie Chan-- to be more specific I love the Fox Charlie Chan films.  I don't understand why everyone gets their panties in a bunch, Charlie was always the smartest guy in the room.  He's not making fun of the Chinese race.  These films represent Charlie's end, when his films had gone over to low budget Monogram in the mid to late forties.

Sidney Toler wraps up his long turn as Chan and he's in ill-health for most of it, Roland Winters takes over and while he's not terrible the movies just aren't as good as the Fox Chans were.  But they're still entertaining and this set was cheap, so I'm good with it and you should be too.",1525132800,3,640,4.3
8762691,4,B01G9CFSSQ,"Finally they put out the remaining 3 Chans on dvd and while by no means classics they are still highly entertaining. We get one Toler and 2 Winters Chans, and not only that but 3 Chan sons, 2 Birmingham Browns, and 1 Chattanooga. Who could ask for anything more?  The Red Dragon has Toler and Benson Fong investigating the murder of a friend in Mexico and stumbling into a plot by spies and Nazis to retrieve a secret formula. Chattanooga ( Willie Best unfortunately not at his best due to stereotypical material he has to work with ) is along for the ride as Charlie's substitute scared and bumbling chauffeur. The Feathered Serpent has the distinction of having 2 Chan sons for the price of one. Keye Luke returns to the series as number one son Lee and Sen Young portrays number two son Tommy. This alone makes the movie worth while and a joy to watch along with Roland Winters acerbic Chan and Mantan Morelands comedic Birmingham Brown. The final entry in the series The Sky Dragon like most final entries is a letdown but still has entertaining moments with Winters and Luke plus Noel Neil as an airline stewardess. Mantan provides the comedy on ground while everyone else is up in the air most of the time. The tranfers are good as is the sound for these old movies. So pick up this collection while you still can especially if your a Chan completest. These dragon entries will slay you.",1524787200,2,1393,4.527777777777778

8762694,5,B01G9CFSSQ,"When watching any of the Charlie Chan films, be aware of the times in which they were made. While racism prevailed in the making of these movies (only white actors played Charlie), in  the original stories of Charlie as written by Earl Derr Biggars racism is largely absent. Given that Biggars wrote the original stories between 1925 and his death in 1933, this is remarkable. I would love to see films of the original stories...set in the late 1920's and early 1930's...with a lead actor of Chinese heritage to play Charlie. It's way past time that this was done.",1509408000,3,564,4.696969696969697
