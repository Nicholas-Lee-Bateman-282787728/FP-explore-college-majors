4552991,3,B0053XZ996,"Released in 2012, The Eves is a backwoods slasher flick about group of college students on route to celebrate Spring Break on the Texas coast; they find themselves stuck in the middle of nowhere after their vehicle breaks down whereupon they seek succor at a rundown hunting ranch. Havoc ensues.

While this is a micro-budget flick, its competently made with decent actors and some spooky backwoods ambiance. Unfortunately, the first hour is just too slow and the characters aren't interesting enough to hold ones attention, neither is their mundane situation hanging out at the ranch. Speaking of which, its a clich in low-budget horror movies to have characters waltz right into someone elses house when no one answers the door and make themselves at home, like it happens all the time. Its just eye-rolling and unbelievable. Wouldnt they be concerned about how the owner(s) will react when they arrive home and see a bunch of strangers hanging out in their house like they own it?

The three girls are okay at best; although theres one Barbie Doll girl, if thats your thang. Theyre pretty good actresses though, particularly the other two. The brunettes the best with her unique look.

The scripts marred by a convoluted subplot about religious abuse and the corresponding nutjobs it produces. The details aren't flushed out enough and the movies not interesting enough to go back and (try to) connect the dots. Still, ""The Eves"" is worth checking out if you like Friday the 13th-like slashers.

The film runs 85 minutes and was shot in Austin & Victoria, Texas.

4552992,4,B0053XZ996,"The story takes the road horror into grindhouse territory effortlessly. The innocent trip that turns into a fight for survival against homicidal madman shows strongly in ""The Eves"". There is a period in the beginning that gets a bit old with the ""ooh you scared me bit"" which really set me into the notion that I was not gonna like this flick. However from the first real scare, that results in the kick-off to the horror show, the film pulled me in. The blunt cruelty of the antagonist, against the helpless victims offers a disturbing sense of realness that hooks you in. I found the cast to be apt in bringing these characters to life, creating a strong, well executed story. Plus with the intense, brutality of the last act, ""The Eves"" becomes a chilling survival nightmare.

The special effects, suspenseful build-up, and over all darkness of 'The Eves"" creates a steady, even-paced intensity the feels natural and ""at times"" cringe worthy. The director does a great job working the cast, and scene direction so that kill scenes look genuine. It is above low budget quality really. The sound effects, and overall ability of the film to keep a strong foreboding atmosphere never falls flat. If it wasn't for the slow, annoying start to the film, with way to many ""fake scare"" moments, then this film would be flawless. Still the second and third act make up for that unnecessary exuberance.",1431907200,6,1394,4.784232365145228
4552993,3,B0053XZ996,"5 guys and 3 girls go on a trip on spring break. The vehicle overheats and they end up at an isolated hunting lodge. The film is similar to a cabin in the woods type of thing. There are personal relationships at work and people getting killed.

This is a run of the mill type of slasher film.

4552994,3,B0053XZ996,"Another children scarred by the scriptures movie. Not bad overall, some decent acting, attractive cast and decent editing although the world seems fixated by quick cuts back and forth too much to suit. If it hadnt been done before, it might have gotten another star, but this storyline has been worked over. A little better of a horror flick than some, the torture apsect is there, but not highlighted so it doesn't detract from the supsense. It would be worth a rental, if it doesn't suit you, there's always fast forward.",1393027200,4,523,4.758241758241758

4552997,2,B0053XZ996,"<strong>The Eves</strong> (Tyler Glodt, 2011)

I had pretty high hopes for this one going in--mix gorgeous sorority girls and crazy religious freaks, put them in the middle of nowhere, add weaponry, and away you go--and for what it's worth, if that's all you're looking for, <em>The Eves</em> delivers in every way. But Glodt and co-screenwriter/star Matthew Albrecht (who have teamed up again for Glodt's second feature, slated for release later this year) don't do anything to shake the cage. At all. Ever. Which leaves us with a movie where the twists are predictable, the final girl is predictable, and if you've seen half a dozen movies like this, you can take one look at the movie's running length and, by time-scaling, reasonably (and accurately) foretell exactly where every jump in the movie's going to be. Don't get me wrong, as I said before, this is a competently-made little thriller, and I think if Glodt and Albrecht decide to think outside the box every once in a while in future collaborations, they will come up with something fine indeed. But this is only a shadow of that. **",1335484800,5,1096,4.86096256684492

8455868,3,B0053XZ996,"OK first of all why pick on the christians? Again? I'm not a christian but they do get poked at a lot from what I see. And though they don't make sense to me or really take a critical look at themselves I'll admit. They seem to be very nice, kind and giving agreeable folk. And I am not from or in Texas but I would sure rather live there than California or New York. The movie is a bit obscure in how this group got together in the first place to travel on spring break. You can drive a truck thru some of the plot holes in this script. But the acting is good, direction and cinematography is professional as well are the fx. So it's not a total loss.
You know as a free thinking libertarian leaning man it's hard to get a break in this world. Everybody wants to rule the world. Why it's so hard for us to live and let live is a mystery to me. They all want to tell us what we can and can't do. Makes you just want to live on an island somewhere. You should be able to say what you want, watch what you want, do what you want as long as you're not forcing someone else to go along. People gotta learn to turn their heads, cover their ears, turn the channel, and mind their own business.
But I digress the movie was worth the watch it was entertaining and that is as it should be. That's my sermon for the day. lol.",1509321600,2,1315,3.9660377358490564
