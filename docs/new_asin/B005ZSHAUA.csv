4911366,5,B005ZSHAUA,"A man wishes for revenge against the person responsible for his wifes brutal death, so he strikes a deal with a demon to gain dark, superhuman powers in a bloody quest for revenge. This movie is definitely an experience. Its a hyper-stylized hybrid of a comic book/anime/splatter film and it is damn good. Insane gore! You can tell it didn't have much of a budget but somehow they deliver some truly remarkable FX work. Brutal kills, over the top bloodshed and just a load of creativity. The direction is great as the pace is completely breakneck, I never witnessed a dull moment. The story is complex at first but unveils very nicely into a rather satisfying affair. A gorefest for a new era but still harkens back to the splatter films of yesteryear. I wasn't exactly expecting brilliance but somehow I got it, and a whole lot more.",1392508800,,834,4.641891891891892
4911367,5,B005ZSHAUA,"I ordered this after reading a review in HorrorHound that said it was more violent than 'Story of Ricky'.
Let me just say I was not disappointed!!  The story of a man who makes a pact with a demon that lives in his shoulder to get revenge on his wife's murderers.  Adam becomes a supernatural demonic killing machine and tears through a city of goons and thugs with his bare hands to get his revenge.  Adam Chaplin: Violent Avenger is a return to bloody, stylized cartoonish violence that hasn't been seen in a while. This one has it all - amazing effects set pieces, a crazy story and unique look.  There's even an homage to Cannibal Holocaust. Highly recommended for those that remember the golden days of gore in the mid to late '80's (Peter Jackson, Lucio Fulci, etc) check it out!",1389657600,5,785,4.507042253521127
4911368,3,B005ZSHAUA,"Good for what it is - low budget horror/gore flick, but definitely overrated.  Blood looks too light red to be convincing",1387843200,2,121,4.761904761904762
4911369,5,B005ZSHAUA,"One of the best low budget films I have ever seen. Truly creative and filled with unbridled imagination and insanity. Definitely not for the squeamish, but if you like dark brooding heroes, gruesome villains, insane anime style fights, and over the top gore then this one is for you. Would make a great double feature with Manborg.",1384387200,3,331,4.824561403508772
4911370,4,B005ZSHAUA,"Totally over-the-top and viciously cartoony, Adam Chaplin is pure insanity on disc. A very basic tale of revenge is coughed up as the necessary setup and to pave a path to Carnagetown, but that's what you came for. You didn't come for some grand romance or an Italian mystery. You came for dudes punching dudes' jaws off, dudes kicking dudes' heads off, and dudes impaling dudes with poles and using them as baseball bats. Adam Chaplin delivers wonderfully.

The quality and dedication to the gore is spectacular. It's not just people spewing out red-colored corn syrup. Heads are exploded and ripped apart. Faces melt off when burning. All of it is taken to a level never seen before. If you are a shock fan, you have to see this film. Necrostorm has elevated gore to an art.

The reason that I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that the video quality is pretty bad. There's a lot of pixilation, and it can be very distracting. As high quality as the stunts and cinematography are, the video itself looks like it was filmed on a poor quality digital handicam and converted to DVD. I also suggest getting it from the Necrostorm website. DVDs purchased there are Region-free and mine came with a mini comic book. I would also suggest checking out the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hobo-with-a-Shotgun-Collector-s-Edition-Digital-Copy-Blu-ray/dp/B004XQO8PK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hobo with a Shotgun (Collector's Edition + Digital Copy) [Blu-ray</a>].",1339200000,6,1498,5.370212765957447

4911375,4,B005ZSHAUA,"This is a really audacious low-budget movie. It reminded me most of The Story of Riki-Oh and the Fist of the North Star series. But it also fits nicely in the camp, gore movie school, like Hobo with a Shotgun, Street Trash and the Toxic Avenger - however this movie is more stylized compared to any of those movies. We have a slick, blue digitized sheen that covers every shot that gets juxtaposed with blood that ranges in color from christmas red to HOT PINK. The gore is abundant and truly non-stop. Blood splashes, sprays and pours in every conceivable matrix.  The movie uses a mix of old school latex effects with CGI, which I think was well integrated given the cartoonish nature of the violence and it's desire to emulate aspects of splatter anime. What makes this movie slightly different than the movies that inspired it, is that this film is practically HUMORLESS. Although the nature of the violence is overtly cartoonish and way beyond the pale - only if you think over-the-top violence is funny in and of itself could this movie be considered funny. Adam Chaplin's quest to avenge his dead wife is treated as a serious quest and the goons and villains he encounters are decked out in extremely grotesque, deformed facial prosthetics that make them unremittingly ugly. And they are generally shot in Ingmar Bergman like close-ups! And unlike the cheesy, over-top villains of Hobo With a Shotgun - the hulking thug ""Denny"" of this movie is a real monster with a backstory. And lets not forget the evil, shoulder demon (a nightmarish stroke of genius!) Even though it is played by a puppet, he is oddly unsettling. Even though Emanuele De Santi is both the star and director of the movie, his screenplay didn't give him much to do, other than brood. He is a presence, though. He certainly holds a Conan era, Arnold Scharwzenegger like appeal about him thru the grim proceedings. Adam Chaplin tries to obliterate as many people as possible in it's quick run time - bones are broken, limbs are bent backwards. Heads are smashed in, smacked off, cleaved in half. It all takes place in an overcast, cold, vague sci-fi concrete setting that is strangely underpopulated. I can't wait to see what De Santi does next.",1415404800,2,2220,4.736434108527132

4911380,3,B005ZSHAUA,Nice effects but really a silly story with no effective rising action or motivation.  Rent this one.,1404518400,,100,4.882352941176471
8489905,5,B005ZSHAUA,"Great film. Gory, animated, full of beatings the likes of which you probably haven't seen too many of. Characters are odd, deformed looking, almost like the camera that was used to film them was on acid. Storyline is great, acting is good, effects are awesome. A breath of fresh air for the splatter genre. I'd love to see more movies with the vigor that this displays. Truly worth viewing.",1514246400,,390,4.666666666666667

8489907,1,B005ZSHAUA,"As a huge fan of this film, I was excited to see the extended edition was given a U.S. release--until I received the DVD. Be warned, this release from BayView does not give you an option to turn on English subtitles in the menu. Not to mention, the movie automatically begins when you insert the disc, so you have to hit the menu button on your player's remote control to get to it, and all it offers is some trailers for other films and the play option for the film. The problem is, unless you watch this disc on a computer, the English subtitle will not display at ALL. I tried this disc on a DVD player, a Blu-ray player, and a Playstation 3, and the English subtitle don't show at all. Finally, when i tried the movie in my computer, the subtitles appeared. I even tried changing closed caption options in my other players to see if I could get subtitles, and nothing. Talk about a defective product. And don't even bother trying to order the edition available directly from the movie studio Necrostorm. Not only is the disc a DVD-R and not a pressed disc, but while it's listed as an all-region disc on their site, it will not play on U.S. Blu-ray players or DVD players. Once again,it will only work on computers.

Bottom line is, unless you have a computer connected to your TV, you can't watch any release of the extended edition of Adam Chaplin on a large TV in the U.S.",1473897600,2,1379,4.365758754863813
8489908,4,B005ZSHAUA,"If you get this expecting taxi driver or the deer hunter, you are way off course. This is the video equivalent of a pulp fiction novel. No Oscars. No awards. Just bloody violent. In case you are wondering why the extended version runs short it is because it is wrong on the DVDs cover and so I can confirm this is the extended version. It 'runs about 10 mins longer than stated. Quality good.",1471910400,,392,4.3108108108108105
8489909,5,B005ZSHAUA,"I recommend that you assure the squeamish that it's just dummies, animatronics, prosthetics and fake blood from hoses, buckets and bladders, before lending or recommending this movie to them. If campy, excessive violence and splatter are what you're after, Adam Chaplin delivers it not in small doses, but like a fat man's banquet. The over the top presentation borders on ridiculous, but maintains it in the stylish vein of ridiculously awesome. It's like one of those dreams that when you wake up, you're simultaneously relieved and disappointed that it wasn't real. Or was it? ;)",1457740800,,582,5.136842105263158
8489910,1,B005ZSHAUA,"This movie was horrible. I think a 10 year old boy either wrote it or advised on it.

Spoiler Alert

Here is the plot (with not much backstory). The star's wife(?) owed money to some religious weirdo, who looked like Troma's Toxic Avenger wearing a black hockey mask. So he and his goons decide to burn her alive. Her...husband (I think) finds her still alive, only she dies later in the hospital. Apparently the star, who looks like a young Triple H from WWE, has made a deal with a demon, who lives on his right shoulder (still with me?) to give him superhuman powers in the attempt to get revenge on his wife's killers.  A cross was burned onto his shoulder when he saw his burnt up wife and now a demon pops out of it. The demon looks like Mike Myers dressed as the Cat in the Hat.

We know Adam has been possessed because his eyes turn white and then when the demon pops out, he spazzes out with a blank stare, kind of looking now like a steroided Spicoli from Fast Times at Ridgemont High (Sean Penn). He then proceeds to pummel anyone in his way until he is able to exact his full revenge. He superman punches people faces off, arms off, then Street Fighter attacks anyone is his way. The effects are also like from a Troma movie. Meanwhile, when he punches a guy to a pulp, the person is still alive long enough for one last super demon punch.
Meanwhile everyone in the movie has some sort of deformity, like they all went to Nuke'em High (also Troma). This is never explained either.

This movie could have been better with more of a back story, better effects and maybe better actors. Look at the name of the star and the credits and you will get the picture. Also, his brother, I'm guessing is in it, plus other people that are apparently in other movies with the star, probably his friends.

Don't believe the other reviews that say this was a good movie. It is Adam Crap-lin!",1455235200,,1888,4.334277620396601
