My friends and I have looked forward to each dvd as they came out, after my friend picked up the first disk at an anime convention. If you haven't seen this series, it is great! And the best part is the outtakes.. So, saddness abounds as we come to the last dvd of this great anime.",1020643200,,345,3.942857142857143
8220129,5,B0000639ER,Great anime! Heard from someone that this is the very last of season. It went really good. You find out a little bit that happens with Takeo and Sae. You even get to see who Mickey is. Which I was personnaly was thinking was like Jeffy (her teddy bear from hte OAV's). Overall it was really good and I don't want to ruin the story for anyone or the ending so i will leave it at this. Enjoy :O),1019779200,2,393,3.9873417721518987
