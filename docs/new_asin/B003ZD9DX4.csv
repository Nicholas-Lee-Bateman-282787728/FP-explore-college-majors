4233450,4,B003ZD9DX4,"I would like to correct the previous review, the 3D is stunning and 100% true...the glasses from the theatre will NOT work...this DVD requires the magenta and green glasses supplied in the package.  I enjoyed it as well as my five year old, my ONLY complaint is the glasses are made for adults, hard for a child to keep on!!!  Can't wait for Ice Age 3D!!!",1287100800,,355,4.363636363636363
4233451,3,B003ZD9DX4,"The movie overall is really good, but the 3D is not true 3D. I thought maybe is was just the glasses so I used glasses from when we saw a 3D movie in the theaters, and still did not work.",1286668800,,187,3.7

4233456,2,B003ZD9DX4,"Only some of the voice talents came back for this sequel.  One wonders why they didn't jump ship while they had the chance to run for cover.

This movie begins with a rehash of the first movie before dragging out a lazy plot that serves no real purpose.  Half of the movie is barely a tour of the planet Malgor with Comet and Kilowatt, while the other half involves dodging the lunacy of Zartog who plots the kill Ham III and take over Earth.  Few people or chimps are present.  The story is mercifully short (but not short enough).  The fact that a chimp could hijack a rocket and no one notices this fairly illustrated just how little thought went into this dismal follow up to Space Chimps.  (And, if they said it once they said it too often, ""you're missing a link."")  A plot actually, but who's going to notice or complain?

This one went into the discard pile immediately after watching it.",1389571200,,896,4.414634146341464

4233458,3,B003ZD9DX4,"Required review: initially I bought this DVD for my great grandchildren, as dvds go, it wasn't one that they requested to see over and over.  They saw it once, Declared that they had seen it at them grandmother's house, and didn't watch it again, (even though they requested that I get it after I rented it for them to see).  But then, that's just the way children are.  I will probably find another child to give it to, or donate it to the charity sales across the street.",1369958400,,473,4.3522727272727275
4233459,5,B003ZD9DX4,I like the first one and the second one was even better then the first it is funny and a great one to watch with the kids.,1369267200,,122,3.5555555555555554
4233460,4,B003ZD9DX4,it awesome movie it not long as I thought but it still good .  the alien got out of  sliver paint and try to get every one to bow down to him .  and the ape who made the banna talkie goes to space not mean to,1368144000,,208,3.382978723404255
4233461,5,B003ZD9DX4,very funny movie the circus chimp is still up to his same ole tricks right along with Zartog he's funny,1364083200,,103,4.2
4233462,5,B003ZD9DX4,It won't bore you even watching for multiple times. Good movie to create interest in space exploration too. Worth watching..,1353974400,,124,5.25
4233463,4,B003ZD9DX4,"Space chimps one plus this one is simple historic and basic goods.

Now Amazon.com is asking me for a really sexy review by requiring me to add at least 20 words minimum in my review, but Im not so eager to help them sell more books, or videos. Your public library for example may carry this video and its a better day spent with you child than looking at a video with them on your 42"" HD TV.",1352592000,,392,4.0256410256410255
4233464,5,B003ZD9DX4,"streams great, downloads fast. kids love it! This is a very cute sequel (sp?) to the first space chimps. If you kids liked space chimps, I would shoe them this one!",1346976000,,164,4.32258064516129
4233465,5,B003ZD9DX4,"when i read other reviews saying it wasn't good, i was expecting it to not be good.  but i thought it was good. it was entertaining and had suspense and a what will happen next feel. i loved the introduction of the g.p. and what it did at the end (giggled). you should watch it and decide for yourself. then read others reviews which might have kill your enjoyment of a movie if you read them before.

by the way it is a 3D movie. make sure your seller has the 3D glasses included. even those with very good condition do not necessarily send the (red/green) 3D glasses too. as one seller put ir: ""the listing description doesnt have 3D glasses listed, so we didn't include them"".",1315526400,,679,4.338582677165355
4233466,3,B003ZD9DX4,"Boy if not for a few of Pixar's franchises (Toy Story mainly), one could really start to fear there's no such thing as a good computer generated animated sequel.  I suppose that isn't entirely accurate; a case could be made for some of the Shrek films, perhaps the Ice Ages and Kung-Fu Panda but by and large (uh hum Open Season 2 & 3), usually direct to DVD sequels leave a lot to be desired!

Even realizing this, I still took a chance on Space Chimps 2; if, for nothing else, because the first film came out of seemingly nowhere and dazzled with some genuinely funny moments.  The second one however showed immediate signs of concern: Gone was the Starz network affiliation, decreased was the budget and axed was the individual who I'm quite certain made the first film so memorable, Andy Samberg of Saturday Night Live fame.

All factors considered, there was a strong chance this film would be a complete and utter disaster.  The good news is that it isn't anywhere near as bad as expected.  The bad news is that it's nowhere near as good as it could have been either.  What you get with Space Chimps 2 is 76-minutes worth of lighthearted computer animation that will likely elicit giggles out of the younger crowd but leave more mature audiences checking the time on their watches.  I suppose another way of saying it would be that there is nothing particularly offensive about Space Chimps 2, but in an era where we have been spoiled in this medium by the likes of Pixar and DreamWorks, this one does absolutely nothing to separate itself from the masses.

The story here is quite basic and uninspired; the technical genius chimp Comet from the first film is bummed that he never got to join Ham, Titan and Luna on their space mission and actually gets cut at the last minute (due to budget restraints) from an upcoming mission to return through the wormhole.

To further crimp his chimp style, it turns out that via the power of the Internet and webcams, Comet has become good pals with the bulbously headed alien girl Kilowatt from the first film, and their eventual meeting is a pretty big deal for all involved.  Thanks to some mishaps, a little cartoon mayhem, and some laughably inaccurate space/ distance traversing, Comet ends up making his disproportionate alien chickie quite a happy little light bulb-head.

Zartog in the mean time comes out of his stasis with suspicious ease and finds himself stuck on earth.  Mistaking the chimp Ham for the leader of all humanity, his plans of intergalactic domination pick up right where they left off in the first tale.

The plot, in case this summary doesn't do it justice, comes off as almost an afterthought intended to string the various scenes together rather than as the starting point of a genuine story.  The point that Comet is generally under-appreciated by his peers is driven home so that even the most oblivious viewer can't miss it.  The characters have certainly lost a lot of their richness this time around as well.  Titan (again voiced perfectly by Patrick Warburton) has taken a turn for the clueless and Ham, the very star of the first film, is a one-dimensional shell of his former self.

As expected with this type of film, much of the comedic attempts are done visually with slapstick, falls, crashes and so on.  Kids will likely get a rise out of these antics primarily in spite of the paper-thin plot structure.

Whereas the first film poked fun of the government, NASA, and humanity in general enough to keep adults entertained, this time around the cleverness is much fewer and farther between.  However, and possibly this whole movie's saving grace, these moments haven't been eliminated completely.  Scenes where pedestrians hit the runaway alien Zartog with their car and wonder if such damage would be covered by their insurance and a dance routine with one of NASA's top scientists in which he busts out, ""When I say Hubble You Say Telescope"" keep this one from being a total washout.

Of course the majority of the runtime finds puns aplenty, many of which are a bit beyond the scope of the younger viewer but not clever enough to impress the adults (Blackberry smartphone called the Banana-berry for example).

In all, this one had all the makings of an utter disaster but comes off as only a minor one.  A few moments are genuine enough to warrant picking it up as a rental for a rainy night- especially if you some youngsters to entertain- but the much farther-reaching charms of the first film have not transferred.  Couple this fact to the 76-runtime and a DVD with virtually no bonuses or special features and what you get with Space Chimps 2 is a little over an hour of mediocrity.",1311292800,3,4678,4.695226438188494
4233467,2,B003ZD9DX4,"Space Chimps 2 is unbearable. I bought it for my 3 year old for Valentine's Day because he loves the original Space Chimps. I wish I could return it. The animation is horrible. The voices of Zartog and Hamm are so far from the original its ridiculous. They sound so flat. Also, what annoys me is that Luna hates Hamm again...and that is not how the first movie ended. It gets 2 stars because my kid loves it....which is extremely unfortunate for me....",1298505600,,452,4.457831325301205

ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF EXPLOITING A DECENT MOVIE'S SUCCESS WITH A HASITLY THROWN TOGETHER SEQUEL TO SELL TO PIGEONS WHO STILL HAVE THEIR WALLETS OUT.

4233469,1,B003ZD9DX4,"I loved ""Space Chimp"", but I will not be buying the sequel. The reason is there is no full screen.

was made. But once you spend your hard earned money for the sequel, within minutes
you know that you've been had.  Space Chimp 2 doesn't have the magic from the first
one...what changed ?  One problem it seems that not all the same actors came back
for the sequel and with that im sure there are several elements. So now im stuck
with this below par sequel....but ill give it another chance on one of those rainy

8410115,1,B003ZD9DX4,Horrible CGI. It's as bad as the latest Nickelodeon cartoon animations. I couldn't sit past the first 10 minutes of it and that was hoping the story line would get even a little better. It just got worse. It is no where near as good/funny as the first one.,1515888000,,256,4.244897959183674
