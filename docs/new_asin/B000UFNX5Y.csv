8325771,5,B000UFNX5Y,"This is the only Dog training program that guarantees almost instant results --and that is with dogs that are hyper and even resistant to training and leash walking.  In the first 20 minutes you won't recognize the ""before"" version of your dog--it is that amazing of a transformation.  I know it is hard to believe, but 20 minutes (lesson 1) is all it takes to prove it to yourself.  This program is for people who need results right NOW, not months of training time invested before seeing some slight improvements.

The best way to get the system is on DVD though, and NOT on VHS tape like the above mentioned Product.  I found the DVD's for sale at
[...]  and ordered them for family and friends (who own dogs) as gifts.

Amazing system, but order it on DVD!!!  I originally ordered one before I realized it was VHS tape!
