I feel so much more relaxed and positive about this whole process of trying to get pregnant (even my husband says I'm in a better mood!). Anna's voice is so soothing and calm and she makes it easy to understand even for someone with little yoga experience. Now if I can just have a BABY I'll move onto prenatal yoga (lol). Try it, you won't be disapointed!",1211932800,10,459,4.111111111111111
3145435,5,B0015KLHOM,"I have ""Yoga 4 Fertility"" by Brenda Strong as well as ""Bend, Breathe, and Conceive"" by Anna Davis.  Both are good but this one is my favorite.  There are lots of forward bends and downward facing dog in both videos but this one has more warrior and triangle poses and other things that add more variety.  The narration is terrific, making it easy to follow and the background music is pleasant and subtle.  The relaxation at the end is wonderful and you're definitely not shortchanged like in other DVDs.  She takes her time and walks you through 3 different relaxation poses - 2 of which are inverted, using the wall to prop you up.  Just a note that you'll need some props for this exercise: block, strap and blankets.  You could probably do it without the block if you're really flexible but the other 2 are essential for the relaxation poses at the end.  I feel stronger and more relaxed when I finish this DVD and I highly recommend it to anyone.",1270425600,3,951,4.488372093023256
3145436,5,B0015KLHOM,"Great DVD, perfect for anyone who wants some simple relaxing yoga. I haven't done yoga for a few months and her poses were a bit challenging at first, but felt great! I recommend this DVD to anyone looking to relieve some stress with yoga",1257292800,,238,4.431818181818182
3145437,1,B0015KLHOM,"Don't waste your money.  After using this video, I was more stressed than when I began. I have to agree with some of the other reviewers when they say this video is lacking.  It really is hard to define what exactly it is about this video but it did nothing for me. Maybe it is because the instructor is just going through these uninspiring motions.  I think she is trying hard but comes across stiff and almost military-like.  No thanks.",1254960000,,438,4.4375
3145438,3,B0015KLHOM,"Not for beginners. Breathing techniques are not easy to grasp. Progression of exercises, poses is very quick. Hard to follow when your head is down, and the guide is already on to the next move. However inspires huge respect for major

I just don't have an hour and a half to sit down and do this. Would be more helpful in a different format. And you need ""equipment"" to do this. I prefer yoga that is simple with nothing more than a mat needed. Would have been better if it was less than $20.00, maybe.",1245974400,2,403,4.05
3145440,5,B0015KLHOM,"I have been practicing yoga for over 12 years at the time of this writing, and I am also an experienced, certified yoga instructor, as well as a prenatal massage therapist. I feel that I can vouch for the yoga as taught in this video-- it is the real deal-- Anna Davis knows what she is doing. I really enjoy this video a lot. I find it calming, relaxing, and invigorating in a gentle way. Perhaps most importantly of all, this video is safe for people wherever they might be in their cycle, or in their TTC process (even if using Assisted Reproductive Therapy of some kind). I feel confident recommending it to anyone who is TTC, whether they are taking a completely holistic approach, or using a combination of eastern and western medicine.
The downsides of the video are:
1.) It doesn't give explanations for why she chose the postures that are included. An experienced yogi will be able to figure this out intuitively, but it isn't spelled out for you. (e.g. She doesn't explain why you might want to do postures targeting your hips, low back, and groin area if you are TTC.) There are plenty of online resources for exploring this further. My favourite is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fully-Fertile-A-12-Week-Holistic-Plan-for-Optimal-Fertility/dp/1844091244/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fully Fertile: A 12-Week Holistic Plan for Optimal Fertility</a>, another outstanding resource for holistic fertility.
2.) The pace is actually a bit quick for my taste. I'm not sure why she didn't stretch this out into a 90-minute practice; I prefer more time in some of the postures. I was impressed that she did give plenty of time for the relaxation sequence at the end. A lot of teachers skimp on final savasana, which is the most important posture of the practice. Again, Davis really gets it. Overall a very good investment.",1241568000,21,1868,5.188741721854305

It did not help me relax, it was uninspiring and about as unoriginal as it gets.  Her voice, the background, the drama are all so distracting and so the opposite of what we should be getting from a fertility yoga session. I feel like she was just going through the motions--no heart. No, this definitely will not help you with fertility...I will have to admit though, it does have a catchy title.",1234828800,4,543,4.366336633663367

3145444,5,B0015KLHOM,"I hadn't done yoga since college.  This dvd was easy to follow and very do-able.  I like the fact that you can choose a chapter at the beginning of the DVD in which she explains scientifically how doing the yoga will help ease the stress that we experience when being challenged in getting pregnant.

The yoga is wonderfully relaxing, but definately tones you up quickly.  I did the yoga about 3 times a weak for a couple of weeks and easily noticed a difference in my muscle tone, yet I never feel strained when I finish the practice.  It is a 60 minute workout so it's not super quick, but I guess you could skip the relaxation sequence at the end if you were pushed for time.

I am so happy that I got this DVD and would definately reccomend it.  Her voice is soothing, the background is soothing and not distracting.  She does the yoga outside with very relaxing music playing in the background.

I guess the only drawback of sorts is that after using the DVD for a couple of months I still feel myself needing to watch her often to see what she's doing or what the next step is, but keep in mind I'm not a very experienced yoga person.  She does still make it easy to understand the poses with her words and demonstration if you watch and listen to what she is doing.",1230940800,,1272,4.2845188284518825

8258857,3,B0015KLHOM,"So the only thing that really makes this a ""fertility"" yoga session is that she spends the first 15 minutes explaining why stress causes infertility, and how regular yoga practice can get your reproductive system going again. That's awesome, I totally agree with all she says. But if you already know all of that, and already practice yoga on a regular basis, this is really just a nice, informative lecture on stress and the nervous system, followed by a typical beginner practice.

Bottom line - I recommend it if you're new to yoga and TTC... otherwise you might skip it.",1382054400,4,574,4.74
8258858,5,B0015KLHOM,"I used this DVD in 2011 before conceiving my daughter. And am now using it again as we are trying for another child.

I'm a beginner at yoga and do not practice regularly. This program makes me wonder why I don't. The sequences are challenging enough to feel stretch and strengthening results. But it's mostly a peaceful te for me to step away and relax and do something to hopefully prepare my body for another successful pregnancy.",1374796800,,433,4.623376623376624
8258859,4,B0015KLHOM,"I like this dvd overall, but as many have said, the pace is very fast. I'd call myself an intermediate level yoga person, and struggled with getting each of the movements. Perhaps with practice I'll catch up. The relaxation piece at the end is great. So all in all, good, but I would definitely not recommend it for those new to yoga.",1363132800,2,334,4.403225806451613
8258860,5,B0015KLHOM,"I think Anna really took the time to explain what you can do for fertility. She takes you step by step on breathing and posts. It also includes a long relaxation which I believe everyone should try after a long day of work.

This yoga dvd also helped me with my back pain since there are some great stretches. I would recommend this.",1360800000,,333,4.285714285714286
8258861,4,B0015KLHOM,"I have done Yoga before not as consistently but off and on for a few years. I like this video, her voice and the music and the relaxation part. I feel calmer when I do this sequence. My only 2 critics are: she has a few poses that are extremely difficult for which she doesn't offer a modification and she is not very specific in the different phases of your cycle. Other than a great Yoga fertility dvd to start.",1345334400,2,413,4.175
8258862,1,B0015KLHOM,"I have been a yoga teacher for many years.  One of my private students came to me after sustaining a back injury doing this DVD.  The pace of the poses and explanations are too rapid,the level of experience needed to do this practice is not explained, and the sequencing does not provide proper warm-up.  It also has limited value for fertility support. Anna Davis had never taught a fertility yoga class prior to making this DVD.",1327017600,16,430,4.631578947368421
