7885685,1,6305202885,This collection is yet another attempt to squeeze money out of World War II buffs by unscrupulous production companies. Each episode casts a very broad net and creates questions which the episode never really answers. However the subjects are covered vastly better in just about any 1 hour History Channel or Discovery Channel documentary. The producers use an English narrator apparently for the sole purpose of sounding authoritative (a la Lawrence Olivier narrating the BBC series 'World at War'). This series is not an English production. Don't waste your time. Even if you see it in the bargain bin cause it's not even worth 2 or 3 dollars from there.,1275350400,,656,4.972727272727273
7885686,5,6305202885,"I agree with the previous reviewer:

The footage is excellent and the background material is top notch. There are a few glitches here and there in the filming but that can be attested to the age of the original footage and not the CD.

For those who can't understand that this material is approx 70 years old,

I suggest you watch some new Hollywood action movie with special effects.

This type of material is not for immature kids.",1169856000,4,433,4.512820512820513

7885688,4,6305202885,"By and large, the Unsolved Mysteries of World War II box set is quite good, filled with important facts and oftentimes fascinating speculation.  The running time of four and a half hours is broken up into 12 separate documentaries, all of which deal specifically with the Third Reich.  The title is a little misleading because you will find almost nothing here dealing with the imperial Japanese army, and the American war effort is really only presented in light of its effects on German strategy and eventual defeat.
Volume 1 features The Riddle of Rudolph Hess, The Strange Death of Geli Raubal, and Drugs and the Fuhrer.  I find much of the information on Raubal's death highly speculative, but the information on the medical facts of Hitler's case is quite interesting.  As for the Rudolf Hess story, I think more attention should have been given to claims that the man imprisoned in Spandau was not truly Rudolf Hess, and the mysterious death of the Spandau prisoner also deserved more attention.
Volume 2 features Decision at Dunkirk and Stalin's Secret Armies.  This look at what essentially constitute two of Hitler's biggest blunders is excellent.  The Russian campaign, and the secrecy Stalin maintained over the state and number of his soldiers to both enemies and allies alike, is a war story too often neglected, and the speculation concerning Hitler's decision to essentially let the British live to fight another day is quite interesting.
Volume 3 features Hitler's Secret Weapon, Enigma of the Swastika, and Himmler's Castle.  The term ""Hitler's Secret Weapon"" is rather lurid and overblown, but the fact that Hitler devoted a disproportionate amount of funds and essential supplies to his rocket program definitely contributed to his ultimate downfall.  There is some speculation that the V-2 was to serve as the delivery mechanism for weapons of mass destruction, but this issue is not pursued as there is little evidence to support it.  The other two documentaries on this tape delve into the occult nature of the National Socialist Party and, in particular, Himmler's feared S.S.; these are subjects I find darkly fascinating.
Volume 4 features Hitler's Secret War and Kill Hitler.  This may be the best video in the series.  ""Hitler's Secret War"" is something of a misnomer, as this documentary covers in great detail the allied breaking of the German military codes early in the war.  Most interesting is the evidence that the Allies ignored significant portions of the information they intercepted for a number of reasons.  The citizens of Coventry were apparently sacrificed because to remove the population before the bombs dropped would have clued Hitler in to the fact that the British knew his codes, and the surprise German counteroffensive at Ardennes in 1944 should have come as no surprise at all  but it did.  Equally surprising is the fact that the Germans never seemed to figure out that the Allies knew of many of their military plans in advance and thus staged some rather remarkable victories.  Kill Hitler covers a number of plots to arrest or kill Hitler, and the analysis of Hitler's fluid relationship with the Wehrmacht is nothing short of riveting.
The final volume features The Eagle and the Swastika and The Last Days of Hitler.  The first documentary covers Hitler's decision to declare war on the United States in the wake of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent American declaration of war on Japan.  The analysis of the inexplicability of this decision is quite valuable to students of World War II.  The look at Hitler's final days is rather disappointing to some degree, as facts that have been pretty well established by now are treated with skepticism or dismissed out of hand.
All in all, I found this an excellent series on the Third Reich's rise and fall.  It must be said that the audio and video quality leave something to be desired, but the information and footage to be found in this set of documentaries is well worth the attention of those interested in the rise of a dictator and the eventual ruin of a conquered German state.",1064016000,19,4110,4.954876273653566
7885689,5,6305202885,"This is a fascinating video covering two topics that probably do not get enough attention among historians and those interested in World War II.  Hitler's Secret War covers the decryption of Germany's vaunted Enigma codification system.  Many would be surprised to learn that German codes were being intercepted and decoded by Polish intelligence before the war really even started with Hitler's invasion of that country in September 1939.  The Polish code breakers made their way to England, and English intelligence basically listened and decoded to a wealth of strategic information coming out of Germany throughout the course of the war.  This intelligence breakthrough was arguably the most important aspect of World War II, essentially guaranteeing Germany's ultimate defeat.  Many questions do arise about this subject, however.  While some information was obtained too late to be put to use, it is clear that some intercepts were ignored by the British.  The most important example of this is the bombing of Coventry and the resulting massive loss of innocent lives; this could have been prevented, but such action on the part of Britain, it was feared, could clue Germany into the fact that its Enigma code had been broken.  As things turned out, the Germans apparently never figured this out at all.  This in itself is quite amazing, given a string of unexpected and unpredictable moves by the Allies in latter stages of the fight, although it can be explained in part by the fact that the Allies, even in 1944, were still ignoring or refusing to acknowledge intelligence data that should have clued them in to such important German moves as the final Ardennes counteroffensive.
Kill Hitler covers much more than the failed attempt to murder the Fuhrer in 1944.  It in effect traces the opposition inherent in the Wehrmacht from the first days of Hitler's ascendancy as chancellor, exploring a number of issues that deprived Hitler of ever achieving the completely loyal support of army officers that he demanded when he declared himself Fuhrer upon the death of von Hindenburg.  It discusses several plots to arrest or kill Hitler, the first important example of which came before the secession of part of Czechoslovakia to Germany; ironically, it was the fervent initiatives of France and England, personified in Neville Chamberlain's determination to avoid war at any cost, that derailed a move that could have removed Hitler from power long before World War II ever began.  The fluid history of the relationship between the Wehrmacht and Hitler is covered quite well here and proves nothing short of fascinating.  The entire collection of Unsolved Mysteries of World War II videos is quite impressive, and I believe this particular tape to be the best of the series.",1052956800,21,2780,5.11037527593819
7885690,2,6305202885,"A utter utter rip-off.  These bad BAD people are making a profit by ripping you off.  There are some short sequences of interesting videos, packaged into a box set, but of low production quality.  Inexcusable.  Only for the true die-hard Third Reich fans.  Wait for it to appear in the bargain bin.  Very sad.  Makes me Sick Heil!  Or, as the Germans used to say, this is pure Kotz durchs Fenster (Vomit out of the Window) stuff.",979862400,10,429,4.48051948051948
7885691,1,6305202885,"I could not believe the bad quality of the footage.  No, it has nothing to do with the original footage.  Even the credits were very blurry and  blocky.  I have had the misfortune of buying another video set, on VHS, by  this same company.  Same dismal results.  I would recommend looking  elsewhere.  The company that makes this video has released lots of video  sets with flashy pictures, but when you actually view them, you realize how  shoddy their workmanship is.  It looks like a bad propaganda film from the  1950s.  My other video set actually was: War in the Pacific.",962928000,12,577,4.64
7885692,5,6305202885,"Thsi 5 Cd collection is quite captivating as well as thought provoking.  It goes into the past of Nazi Germany and answers many questions while leaving just a few unanswered, possibly in the hopes of spurring on new  research.  I found myself stopping and rewinding each cd several times to  go over the material presented.
The footage is excellent and the  background material is top notch.  There are a few glitches here and there  in the filming but that can be attested to the age of the original footage  and not the CD.
These cd's will make a great gift for the World War II  buff or someone with a keen interest into the the secrets of Nazi Germany.  I myself would like to know what was in Himmler's safe in his SS castle, as  well as what happened to those who opened the vault.  Somethings, only time  will tell!",959644800,19,822,4.4
