I especially appreciate seeing the processing of pigments and all that goes in to making quality artist's colours... In sharing this information with middle school students over the years, the old, natural source for Indian yellow and Alizarin Crimson are of course the favorites... how can you beat crushed bugs and cow pee for paint ingredients?
I always marvel at the brush dressers in this film, and can't believe the dexterity and speed with which they shape the favored Winsor Newton series 7 Watercolor brushes. Most people can't even put a brush cover on without mashing some errant hairs and these brush dressers are able to push the whole bristle clump through a ferrule backwards without a single errant hair... Astonishing. And they do it with great speed too.
I don't know how much of these processes still exist, even for Winsor Newton, but I love viewing this film and appreciate my artist's tools so much more with this knowledge.
It is a great information and insight video if not to the current manufacture, to the wealth of history in Artist's materials and tools.
I love it.",1447113600,,1178,4.779411764705882

8351632,5,B0026104KM,"This video from Winsor and Newton is a fabulous and thorough study in the making of artist's colours.  The process of making water colours, oils, and alkyds is shown, as well as the making of the finest of brushes from the tail hairs of the Kolinsky sable brushes.  I love to show this video to students when I teach about colour.  It is fascinating to see how pigments were discovered and developed over time.  Some of the pigments have not changed in centuries.  Anyone who portends to be an artist should watch this.",1338336000,2,519,4.537634408602151
