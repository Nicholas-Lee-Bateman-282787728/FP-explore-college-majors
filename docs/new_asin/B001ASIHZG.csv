3466644,3,B001ASIHZG,"Lawyer Eli Stone (Jonny Lee Miller) has it all.  He's on the fast track to become a partner at his law firm.  He is engaged to the beautiful Taylor Wethersby (Natasha Henstridge) who just happens to be his boss Jordan's (Victor Garber) daughter.  About the only problem in his life is that his assistant Patti (Loretta Devine) doesn't like Taylor.

But then the visions start.  First, it's George Michael (in the first of several cameos) singing in his living room.  But soon they include a war zone, a beach in the men's room, and a dragon in down town San Francisco.  Not to mention just about everyone he knows breaking out into song at the worst times, like in the courtroom.

It's at that point that his brother Nate (Matt Letscher) diagnoses a hereditary brain aneurism.  They are the reason for these visions.  As much as he tries to get rid of them, his acupuncturist Dr. Chen (James Saito) thinks they may be prophetic in nature.  And sure enough, they do seem to be helping him pick and win cases.  What will he do with his new found moral compass?  Can he get the aneurism operated on?  Or will that mean his death?

I didn't have much faith in this show, but tuned in for the premier to see just how the show would handle things.  I was surprisingly hooked and tuned in each week to see how the story would progress.  And make no mistake about it, there are on going plots here involving the characters and their relationships, especially two love triangles and Eli's status in the firm thanks to his new choices in cases.  And I certainly can't fault the acting.  Everyone pulls me in every week.

The downfall of the show is the politics it tries to bring into the mix.  Due to Eli's new ethics, he seems to lean toward cases that involve controversial topics.  While some don't seem to overwhelm the rest of the show, every so often they bring out a liberal cause and champion it to the expense of storytelling.  The worst offender was the episode against abstinence education, which does little more than create and defeat straw men in the least entertaining way possible.  (Heck, it made Jordan act completely out of character.)  On the other hand, a very strong case is made against right to die as well.  An attempt to be balanced?

When the show isn't preaching, it is a highly entertaining hour of television.  When it does decide to preach, it becomes painful to watch.  I do intend to see where the show goes in the up coming season.  Personally, I would probably rent this one before buying.",1220313600,10,2515,4.524444444444445

Because the nearest ABC station is over 100 miles away, and has been in a running spat with the two satellite/dish companies, up until I got my HD converter hadn't seen a ABC show in two years. (Life's too short to try to watch all the downloads) Wish I'd had the chance to see this show first run -- thank heaven for reruns.

Wildly funny with a lot of heart, this kind of series is very difficult to pull off. If the creators aren't careful it's easy to drown in syrup, and too hard an edge grinds down your characters. ""Eli Stone"" threads this needle with precision. Themes of belief, faith, whether higher powers are guiding Eli, and a not-so-subtle call for social justice. The first season's arc grows everyone, not just Eli, and Eli and Nate's father grows the most -- a sweet trick since he's been dead for ten years. Sliding relationships, office politics, courtroom drama and cases drawn from real life problems are balanced by the rowdy goofiness of his visions' musical numbers. It seems there's never a good time to have a full-on hallucination. (""Good Lovin'"" from #4 and ""I Feel the Earth Move"" from #8 are favorites.)

The cast is consistently wonderful. Have loved Victor Garber for years, way before ""Alias"", and it's great to see him not only act but perform. Julie Gonzalo,  Natasha Henstridge, Loretta Devine, Matt Letscher, and James Saito are all excellent, not a clunker in the bunch.

But the show hangs on Jonny Lee Miller, and I must admit, he's been amazing. Miller has an marvelously expressive face. From confusion and embarrassment to desperation, sympathy, sarcasm, cunning, panic, innocence and sometimes fury when he's defending his clients. You can always see what's passing in Eli's head. But Miller's voice is just as amazing, practically every line has an softness or an edge that pulls your attention, makes you listen. Full blown drama to light comedy, he's been incredible to watch.

(Warning: spoilers ahead!) Glad the show has been renewed. The creators have carefully planted a half-dozen story threads. Eli and Maggie are destined for each other, but she's currently engaged. His ex-fiancee, Taylor, still loves Eli, but can't believe in his visions. In episode 12, Eli both accurately predicted an earthquake and prevented a disaster. But the season's finale neatly sidestepped how the city will view him, Eli has to go public now. But the most intriguing question is: how has he changed? Has he changed? Eli had the aneurysm causing his visions removed. While the surgery was a success, a hemorrhage and heart attack so damaged his brain his brother was about to pull the plug. Odd thing though, even without the aneurysm, even while comatose, Eli was still fulfilling his mission and trying to convince a dying cancer patient to fight to live. Did the aneurysm give Eli his visions, or was it just a scientific excuse? Will the visions still come? And now Eli has brought himself back, out of the coma. A miracle that everyone will have to accept or deny.

Hope the suits at ABC keep their fingers off this show, Greg Berlanti and Marc Guggenheim have proved they know what they're doing. Really looking forward to the fall.",1216080000,52,3193,4.836996336996337
3466646,5,B001ASIHZG,"Warning! Many, many spoilers! Do not read if you want to avoid spoilers!

The 2007-2008 television series has to go down as one of the most unfortunate in recent decades, not primarily because of the quality of the shows - there were, in fact, an unusually large number of very high quality shows - but because of the large number of truncated seasons that so many shows experienced. We also saw a smaller number of midseason series. For instance, the eagerly awaited new Joss Whedon series, DOLLHOUSE, starring Eliza Dushku, was initially planned to appear for seven episodes this spring before returning next fall for a new regular slate of shows. Now it has been postponed to the fall, where it will be the most eagerly anticipated new show of the 2008-2009 season.

But one thing the writers strike did mean was that the few new midseason shows had little or no competition. I was really looking forward to TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES, and was delighted when it didn't disappoint. But just before it debuted I started hearing about a new series called ELI STONE. To be very honest, under normal circumstances I would never have tried it. I would have had a full slate of shows that I was already committed to and I simply wouldn't have bothered to work it into my schedule. Furthermore, it was set at a law firm, and I generally detest shows set in law firms. But the early reviews by critics were positive if not ecstatic and I had virtually nothing to watch on TV until my favs began to crank out new episodes following the resolution of the WGA strike. So starved for new shows I decided to give it a shot.

From the very beginning ELI STONE was at least decent and fun. I wasn't blown away, but each episode was enjoyable enough to bring me back the next week. Jonny Lee Miller (who felt more ""American"" to me than any of the actors from Great Britain or Australia portraying one of my fellow countrymen) was instantly likable as an up and coming attorney who suddenly begins having strange visions as the result of a brain aneurism. His acupuncturist suggests that there might be a purpose to his aneurism, that he might, in fact, be called by his visions to be a modern day prophet. Credence is granted to this as his visions lead him to help people he had seen in his visions but whom he had never met in actual life. Gradually one person after another comes to have ""faith"" (Eli's first vision is of George Michael singing the song ""Faith"" while standing on his coffee table in his living room) in Eli, even the initially hard-hearted head of the law firm, played wonderfully by Victor Garber.

All of this would be well and good except for one thing: with each episode the series developed more and better layers. The show started off good, but by the end of its 13-episode run it was approaching something not far from great. The moment that illustrates ELI STONE at its best - OK, ONE MORE SPOILER ALERT! - was an episode from near the end of the season. Eli has a vision. He is on Time's Square in New York (made even more unusual in that the series takes place in San Francisco), tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people crowded about, holding signs that read ""Live Brave!"" Eli sees a platform with a podium and a young but charismatic black man take his place behind the podium and begin to speak, beginning with his name. Eli sees this as a vision that he is supposed to help him. Discovering that he is currently a prisoner in the California penal system Eli takes on his case, eventually leading to uncovering systematic civil rights abuses at the prison. The man he came to help was not released, but at least the possibility of his eventual release was created. You think perhaps at this point that this episode was over, that all the central points had been made. But as Eli leaves the office building his vision returns, the young man once again speaking on the podium. Eli is further astonished to see himself standing at the base of the platform, one of his coworkers standing near him holding what is obviously his and her child. And in the speaker's next words we understand that he wasn't the point of this great assembly, which is what Eli had assumed, but was there merely to introduce the central figure for the evening, Eli Stone himself. The episode fades out with an expression of shocked incredulity on Eli's face. The whole scene might be my favorite moment from any show of the entire 2007-2008 season so far (and that is saying a lot with shows like PUSHING DAISIES and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS out there).

The show is made even better by a very, very good cast. I've seen Jonny Lee Miller in a lot of things over the years, from HACKERS (where I believe he met Angelina Jolie, with whom he was long involved) to MANSFIELD PARK, but he's never been someone I thought of as someone who could anchor a show. But he certainly does here. I already mentioned Victor Garber. This show might center around Eli Stone, but without Victor Garber in his role, many of the vision scenes would not work. Many people may be aware that Garber, in addition to being a talented actor (most know him as Jack Bristow on ALIAS) is a phenomenally gifted Broadway musical performer. He puts his musical skills on display frequently on the show. Similarly, Loretta Devine, who plays Eli's assistant, is a ferociously talented singer and she gets her own opportunities to sing. The beautiful Natasha Henstridge plays Eli's former fianc and Garber's daughter and brings a lot to the show as someone no longer with Eli, but someone who still cares a great deal for him. I could mention many others, but I'll stop with two. Matt Letscher has many wonderful moments as Eli's brother. One of the highpoints of the season occurs when Eli relives his father's death through the eyes of his brother. And I instantly loved Julie Gonzalo as the new and idealistic assistant who frequently takes second seat in Eli's cases. Her involvement on the show leads to one of the show's best shout outs. Eli and Maggie (played by Gonzalo) go to Hawaii in search of a key witness in a case. As they are walking along Maggie makes a suggestion about how they might locate him. In his mildly snappish reply Eli calls her ""Veronica Mars."" Gonzalo had, not coincidentally, played Parker on VERONICA MARS, the ditzily happy roommate of Veronica's friend Mac.

There are two things that I really loved about ELI STONE. First, I really appreciate the fact that it got better and better as the season went along. So if you give this a try and don't like it at first, just wait. It starts off OK but ends up a thing of beauty. Second, this is perhaps the finest ""feel good"" show on TV. I wouldn't rank it as one of the very, very best shows on TV (I'd group it in the next tier of shows). It isn't quite in the same category as FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, LOST, PUSHING DAISIES, or MAD MEN, but it is ultimately upbeat and hopeful to a degree that those are not. FNL has many, many dark moments as many characters perpetually struggle with their own demons. LOST is often dark, but BATTLESTAR GALACTICA is so much darker that it makes LOST look like HAPPY HOUR. MAD MEN deals with a bunch of cut throats. Even PUSHING DAISIES, perhaps the most magical series in the history of TV, mixes much of its magic with some genuine darkness. But ELI STONE is all about hope. With his vision on Times Square we even know -- more or less -- how this whole thing ends. We know who he will end up with romantically. We know that he will achieve great things. What we don't know is how things will progressive from here to there. But the happy ending has been put in at the beginning. And moreover the tone of each episode is very positive and upbeat. Like I said, a feel good show.

The only possible problem is that we do not yet know if ABC is going to renew ELI STONE. The ratings for the last few episodes were good if not stunning. The word is that execs in ABC like the show. And I believe that a buzz for it was building near the end of its run. I would be dishonest if I didn't say that I think the chances for its renewal are very good. In the meantime I recommend that anyone who likes good TV go out and watch this show. Either stream it off ABC.com or get these DVDs when they come out. Make yourself a fan. I promise it won't be difficult.",1215820800,48,8390,4.4761593729588505

FROM NORTHERN EXPOSURE TO ELI STONE AND BEYOND:
THE SMOGASBOARD SPIRITUAL MECHANO SET TEMPLATE; A LITTLE BIT OF BUDDHA HERE, SOME SHIVA THERE, A DASH OF THE STAIN-GLASSED BRAD PIT LOOKALIKE JESUS OF THE IMAGINATION WHO WILL JUDGE NO ONE FOR ANYTHING; ALL TOPPED OFF WITH A PINCH OF ZEN, A LITTLE ""LISTEN TO YOUR HEART IT WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH"", AND A FEW INDIAN HEAD DRESS FEATHERS TO HELP MAKE THE IDOL A LITTLE PRETTIER AND DEEP TO THOSE WITH EYES THAT DO NOT SEE AND EARS THAT CANNOT HEAR.
A MANY HEADED BEAST IF EVER THERE WAS ONE!
THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS STUFF, SPIRITUALLY SPEAKING, A PRECURSUR TO THE ONE WORLD RELIGION; IT IS, AFTER ALL, ALL PART OF THE PLAN TO GET PEOPLE TO THINK THAT FAITH IN FAITH IS SOMEHOW ENOUGH TO AVOID THE FLAMES THAT THIS WAY COME.
A PROPHET WHO PRACTICES EXTRA-MARITAL SEX???
A ROCK STAR CAUGHT DOING DODGEY STUFF IN A TOILET STALL AS A SYMBOL OF DEEP FAITH AND SPIRITUALITY?

3466776,3,B001ASIHZG,"You have to have faith that this show gets really good in the second season.  I'm not that fond of the musical type visions that Eli Stone has...my favorite episodes are those without the ""song and dance"" routines.  Also Eli tends to get really involved in his visions even though it has been established that they are just visions so he ends up making a fool out of himself in the law firm where he works and even in the courtroom...but all that ""drama"" is needed in order to take the show where the writers wanted it to go for the second season.  One part of the story that I never really understood ***spoilers*** is why he ended his engagement with Taylor due to his aneurysm because he pursued SEVERAL other women afterwards so that really couldn't have been the reason.  I wish they would have given a more solid reason for dissolving their relationship other than the aneurysm.

The show is a lot of fun and the second season really picks up steam and then was canceled...boo...but it's still worth watching...",1303689600,,1017,4.565934065934066
3466777,5,B001ASIHZG,"There have been many wonderful television shows dealing with transpersonal themes over the years, including The Twilight Zone (Alternate Realities), Quantum Leap (Time Travel), The X-Files (Alien Encounters), Touched by an Angel (Angels), and Joan of Arcadia (Divine Guidance). These types of shows also appear to be growing in number recently with several superb transpersonal television shows showering the television airways within the past couple of years, including: Lost (Metaphysical Realities), Life (Zen), Life on Mars (Time Travel), The Event and V (Alien Encounters), Heroes, Kyle-XY, Chuck, No Ordinary Family, and Fringe (Exceptional Human Capacities), Merlin and Camelot (Magic and Alchemy), and Eli Stone (Divine Guidance).

While all of these shows are excellent transpersonal television journeys, I believe Eli Stone must be singled out as one of televisions transpersonal masterpieces. The reason I believe Eli Stone deserves this mantle, is that it not only explores a transpersonal topic with great depth, grace, wit, and integrity, it also has the capacity to give the viewing audience a powerful experience of higher and illusive states of being. How often does a TV show induce a deep sense of grace, hope and faith in the face of life's haunting mysteries? This is very rare...so I say, BRAVO to the creators of Eli Stone! But I also have to give a big BOO to the network (ABC) who never gave the show the chance it deserved and canceled this gem of television enlightentainment. Luckily we have the first and second season of this gem on DVD.",1302048000,2,1567,5.218253968253968
3466798,5,B001ASIHZG,"The fact that this is the only review I've ever given on amazon is an indication of how great of a show this was. Just too bad that it's no longer on. The second season wasn't as good as the first in that the writers had orginially intended the show to just be a season-filler, so the finale gave it a great ending and felt like a complete package. The second season is still good, but the writers add more mystical stuff that ends up making the show seem a little too over the top during some moments that had me rolling my eyes. (Although this was a small misdemeanor as I still love all things Eli Stone.) Definietly one of the few DVDs I'd invest in actually purchasing!",1296345600,,674,4.232558139534884

3466800,2,B001ASIHZG,"The idea of Eli Stone is a good one. I enjoyed the idea of a modern-day prophet dealing with a skeptical world. The cast is excellent; the characters are believable; the concept is unusually good; and the production value is first-rate. However, the self-righteous preaching got a bit much in the middle of the first season. Successful courtroom dramas do well because they don't oversimplify complex issues but show all sides of the argument...after all, if these problems were that easy, there wouldn't be a courtroom case in the first place. This series picked out a few one-sided political opinions of the day and tried to make them into unsassailable moral issues, and in their haste to beat the viewer over the head with their ideology, they got sloppy. They based their arguments on fallacies instead of good, clean logic, and the argumentation in some of the more controversial episodes was shallow at best. There are times I found myself physically rolling my eyes when one of the characters began to bloviate. I thought the writers show a deep disrespect for viewers who disagree with the writer's political and moral views. I can see why the series tanked after the second season. That it even made it to the second season is a credit to the actors and character development. I found myself continuing to watch the first season only because I cared about what happened to Eli and friends in their personal dilemmas not because of the believability of the courtroom scenes. I don't think I'll continue on with the second season. I'm not even sure I'll finish the last four episodes in the first one. LOST was a much better series in its dealings with real moral issues and inner change in a person without being preachy or overbearing.",1290988800,5,1745,4.8006644518272426
3466801,5,B001ASIHZG,"I had never heard about Eli Stone until a friend raved about it, and so I went to Amazon to see the reviews. When I read other people raving about the series as well on Amazon, I had to buy the first season to see what everyone was talking about.

I watched the entire Season 1 in one weekend. It was that riveting, so much so that I could not pull myself away from Eli Stone.

It is hard to describe the series except to say it is about a lawyer who develops a brain aneurysm which causes him to have prohpetic visions. Yeah, I know, that doesn't sound all that unique, right?

But I am telling you that the writers of this show are so talented that they truly make this series refreshingly unique. Not only convinceable, but yes, there is that word ""riveting"" again.

The characters are so well-rounded and deep that you really grow to care about them. But what is best of all are the constant surprises that this show throws at you. I could never guess what was about to happen next. Eli Stone is exceptionally well done in all regards.

Quirky, sweet, funny, and so darn likeable, that is the show Eli Stone. I found myself laughing at parts and literarlly crying at other parts. Eli Stone brought out emotions in me that I didn't think I could feel for any mere television show. It is that good. No, let me rephrase: Eli Stone is awesome.

Do yourself a favor and buy Season 1 to find out what all the hulllabaloo is about when referring to Eli Stone. I have already bought Season 2 and I cannot wait for it to arrive in my mail.",1290816000,2,1534,4.254295532646048
3466802,5,B001ASIHZG,"I found out about this show through Netflix.  I rented the first disk and knew I would purchase the series.  What a wonderful, heartwarming, funny, touching storyline.  Jonny Lee Miller is fantastic as Eli Stone.  As another reviewer mentioned, his face is so expressive that you can read all of his emotions.  His voice has a gentleness about it that is very endearing.  I have seen him in Emma and it is remarkable how he sounds completely american in this series.
Too bad the show was canceled! This one deserved to hang in there a lot longer.",1286928000,,546,4.577319587628866

I had only missed one episode or two when it ran in tv.

A brilliant young attorney is diagnosed with a potentially fatal brain aneurysm and starts hallucinating musical production numbers at the worst times--in meetings and in the courtroom. And then the ""fun"" begins. Jonny Lee Miller (the ex-Mr. Angelina Jolie) is super as Eli. You wouldn't guess he's a Brit.",1282003200,,540,5.27906976744186

The acting, dancing and singing is superb, some of the actors you would never expect to see singing do a great job. Set in Law offices mostly, it is one of the most original shows I have seen in a long time.

3466807,5,B001ASIHZG,"Eli Stone is a wonderful show and I was so sorry to learn that it only had two seasons, but both seasons are definitely worth purchasing and watching, as well as passing along to friends and family. We watched both seasons in two weeks, a couple episodes every night. This show is full of interesting character developments, engaging musical scenes, and most of all, hope that anyone can change and often will when role models exist. Thirteen years ago we cut off our cable and went off live television because so little existed that offered a way for us to view the world with hope and direction. This show renews one's sense that the universe is ordered and that we all can change and grow into better people. The character of Eli has a personal transformation that helps so many others to follow suit. It's too bad that a show demonstrating the cathartic power of ""doing the right thing"" was not embraced quickly enough to have staying power in our world of instant gratification and search for quick profits. This show is well worth purchasing, viewing, and giving to others as a gift. I cried at the end of the last episode, realizing that the season and the show was over. Where would we go now (in an entertainment sense) to be  encouraged to embrace our integrity, re-establish our honor, and continue to develop our faith in a positively evolving universe? Well done, those who helped bring this show to the world. You have helped to change lives and should be very proud of your uplifting work.

HE ACTUALLY DEVELOPS A CONSCIENCE AND IS SO DEEPLY AFFECTED BY IT THAT HE ACTUALLY USES HIS LAW DEGREE TO HELP PEOPLE IN NEED.  IT IS HIGHLY ENTERTAINING.

She isn't funny - just annoying.  The other thing that bothered me was the Earthquake episode where at the end Eli rails at God for not sending him the earthquake to save face with his secretary.  Huh?  Even if an earthquake was still to come, isn't it kinder for God to wait until the residents had time to find new homes and move out?

3466835,1,B001ASIHZG,"The first couple of episodes I LOVED, it really had me hooked with the dynamic cast and interesting cases. Then it got real annoying real fast. The biggest issue I had was the relationship between Eli and his fiance. He ended things with her to spare her from his death, but then he starts making out with the annoying assistant? Dumping one woman for the sake of sparing feelings only to start something with another one shows a spineless uncaring character to me. He never claimed he fell out of love with his fiance and I felt like the relationship with him and Maggie was forced. I think it would have been much better if a romance was not an issue with him and Maggie. And Maggie believed him because she said he never steered her wrong but once he does something she does not approve of (winning a case that was ""evil"" to save a lives (the earthquake one)) she turns her back on him.
I loved Victor garber the entire way through, he remained consistant and I have really always been a fan of his. I liked his daughter allot and if anything I sympathized with her more than I did the main characters, she was kind and realistic with human flaws as well as spirit.
The assistant at first was funny, but that role quickly got old, especially her high horse that she constantly rode on and her treatment of the fiance was horrible and very unkind. Even when she was the one who saved her job the assistant was still a big meany.
I loved the story of the acupuncturist and the history of Eli and his Father was very interesting. I think this show had a ton of potential, but I was left very dissapointed. The best thing I got out of this show was the song ""you gotta have faith"" stuck in my head... so catchy, and watching the songs was great, Victor Garber is a very talented singer too.",1234915200,7,1789,4.3273809523809526

3466839,5,B001ASIHZG,"Never heard of Eli Stone before until I went to the States. It was the time when the Olympics just started and you have some in between re-runs to fill in the time slots. That was when I stumbled across Eli Stone in my hotel room flipping through channels. I was surprisingly hooked. After I came back to Australia, looked like nobody had heard about it. It was just like I had a hallucination of the series that never occurred. So I tracked it down and bought it online.

It is one of the few purchases that I am glad that I did. I watched all 13 episodes through in one weekend and was just hooked to it. The premise of the show was a lawyer caught a hereditary disease that causing him to have hallucination of things...sometimes really ridiculous ones - including George Michael showing up everywhere in his life. However he gradually realised that these visions were a sign of something bigger that he didn't understand or know - something that helped him to know more about true values and understand his father. Adding to the formula is the quirky acupuncturist who uses his needle skills to tap into the depths of these visions to solve the puzzles.  It's like Ally McBeal meets Six Feet Under.

Jonny Lee Miller did a really good job as Eli and he really leads the show. But the supporting cast such as Loretta Devine are just great  and added a lot of colours to the heartless law firm. Victor Garber as Eli's in-law to be also put on a great performance and not to mention to the true blue American acupuncturist who put on a thick Chinese accent to convince his clients played by James Saito.

Eli Stone is a great piece of work that is buried among other ""name greater than essence"" franchises. It took a few episodes to pick up maybe but then once you picked it up, you'll be hooked to it for sure. If you are looking for something light and touching for a night / weekend in, Eli Stone is something you should check out.",1233705600,,1935,4.393854748603352

Eli Stone, with the help of his fellow attorneys, his spunky secretary, his brother, his acupuncturist, and others, goes through some adventures in both the legal and spiritual worlds during the first season.  There are gay chimps to defend, as well as an earthquake-predicting man, a teen suing an anesthetist, and many more.  Jonny Lee Miller is wonderful in the title role, appealing and sympathetic but never manipulating or trying to push the viewers' buttons.  George Michael appears periodically as the mainstay of Eli's musical visions and in person too.

3466849,5,B001ASIHZG,"The first episode of Eli Stone that I watched was one from the second season, and not knowing anything about the show or the characters I was fascinated by it.  It's hook isn't the visions that Eli has or the stories related to his visions... the hook is the geniune emotion; the way the show speaks to the human condition.

I immediately rushed out and found the first season and couldn't stop watching.  It is now my favoirte show on television.
Eli Stone isn't getting much of a chance to succeed.  With all of the shows on television centering around cops, drugs, violence and ""let's see how edgy, dark and daring we can be"", a show that promotes hope and shows you just how much good is left in the world... well that kind of show doesn't stand a chance.

This show deals with religion and spirituality without preaching.  Therein lies part of the genius of this show.  It suggests that religion/spirtiuality doesn't have to come from going to church, being a bible thumper or listening to sermons... no, it comes from people.  It says, ""put your faith in people and be amazed at what you discover.""
It's a joy... no, an honor to be able to watch a show that deals with the human spirit/condition as marvelously as this one does.

It's a shame that this show is being cancelled.  It'll go down, in my book, as another great show that met it's untimely demise just like:  Ed, Sports Night, Freaks and Geeks and, yep, Everwood the other show created and written by Greg Berlanti, the genius behind Eli Stone.",1228262400,,1511,4.538745387453875

It's better than ""Touched by an Angel"" in that it is not as sentimental although it has some of that show's spiritual dimension.  I love the intermittent musical numbers with guest star George Michael. There are not too many of them so that when the come, they really hit the mark.  Intriguing characters, fine, natural, believable acting and well written scripts keep each episode flowing nicely.  Worth savoring repeat viewings on DVD at home without commercial interruption.

3466855,5,B001ASIHZG,"Eli Stone season one ranks among my favorite television programs of the last few decades. Perhaps what attracts me most to this series is how Eli Stone (the character) is so willing to sacrifice his status and reputation to do what he believes is right. His visions often take the form of his co-workers dancing and singing, and inevitably, he becomes swept up in the moment only to discover he is the only one actually dancing and singing when his vision ends. While these actions are involuntary, the decisions he makes when he is in control are what make him endearing. He would rather have his contemporaries think he is crazy than to risk the welfare of his friends or even a stranger.

The first season stands alone as a complete story. It starts slowly and builds gradually to a finale that is a true work of art. While I am glad they are making a second season, I must admit that I have mixed feelings. Sometimes the right thing to do is to recognize when a painting or musical composition or story is complete. Adding any more may detract from the whole. Perhaps I worry too much.

Regardless of how the second season turns out, the first season is well worth your time and money. Eli Stone puts a tenacious smile on your face, and as irrational as this sounds, you can't help but like everything and everyone a little bit more after each episode.",1223164800,2,1356,4.508130081300813

I purchased this DVD because I'm a loyal fan of George Michael and I can't see Eli Stone in Italy. Thanks to Guggenheim and Berlanti for their celebration of pop star George Michael: each episode sports one of Michael's songs as its signature theme.
Jonny Lee Miller, as Eli Stone, is a nice and great actor; he said ""'It was a big challenge to work with George, because I was a huge fan.""
Nice pictures, great actors, original themes, amazing songs.
My final opinion is ""a nice story of a prophet-lawyer and a lovely celebration of pop star George Michael"".

3466860,4,B001ASIHZG,"How many law shows do we need in this country, and don't they all simply run together? PerryLABostonthePraticeMcBealandOrder? I can understand the writer's interest in writing a law show; great episodic stories that you can immediately buy into for a week's episode supported by guest stars that easily come and go, inter-office romances, people who make a lot of money which usually means they make a lot of problems. But aren't they all basically the same?

I guess that's why I initially shied away from watching Eli Stone, despite some catchy promos that I was watching during my Lost-fest. All we needed was another law show like we need another medical show. However, being a legal show grouping, and still smarting after the cancellation and no-DVD release of Ally McBeal, my partner Shane became a quick fan.

So it was just a matter of time before I'd sit down in front of the tube to watch Eli Stone. And what I was, ultimately, was enjoyable! Why? First, the premise of the show is interesting, having a killer corporate lawyer Eli Stone (Jonny Lee Miller)  discover he has a brain aneurysm which causes him to have visions that ultimately help out his cases and causes. The visions seemingly point Stone to take cases that normally wouldn't have appeared on his radar screen, much to the chagrin of law office partner Wethersby (Victor Garber) and his daughter and Stone's fiancee Taylor (Natasha Henstridge).

As each episode untangles, you get the sense of some larger pictures that Eli Stone can paint; issues of destiny, divine intervention, and sometimes having to appear to do wrong in order to do right. Stone is not afraid to address these issues, nor are the characters in the show willing to back away when confronted with them, as office assistant and svengali Patti (the amazing Loretta Devine) keeps Stone on his moral toes.

While in every sense, this is yet another legal show, with cases, and many law office scenes, one can sense something bigger and larger looming on the horizon with Eli Stone. For sheer entertainment value (when Eli has a vision, watch out!), and a chance to see George Michael appear on TV, Eli Stone will on my watch list this season.",1220918400,7,2186,4.803191489361702
