8664103,4,B00L6AW2EA,"For anyone looking for a girl orientated kickass action-fest look no further.  The plot is totally implausible and has holes you can drive a truck through yet it still all hangs together surprisingly well and, in any case, who cares with directing and action this exciting?
Belinda Camesi is the whiny, sulky unwillingly karate-trained teenager (understandably bewildered) on the run with her mother (sinuous Dominique Diyose) from murderous gangs hired by Tio Pakusadewo, whose identity is only revealed later.  Is the woman that's shielding Camesi even her mother?
Brooding Sarah S Carter, who may be the real mom, plays a mystery woman out of prison assembling a gang of her own, coming between pursuers and pursued (there's a terrific wild multi-vehicle car chase around Jakata metropolis and crowded motorway with AKA's liberally blasting away).  One had to smile at the end credit words ""Dedicated to all Mothers in the World"".  This is really an excuse for a gratuitously violent shoot 'em up/beat 'em up.  I loved it.
This is a movie where every male in it is a treacherous bastard who seems to be coming out of the woodwork every few minutes to rub out the ladies (there are bad gals with them too including a black leather-clad knife-wielding female assassin).  The goons with massed artillery are frequently dumb enough to be in plain sight ready to be shot down by females.
Great male/female karate action at the end too.  This makes the point that there's no-one  deadlier than a mother protecting her young from harm, whether it be her own or by adoption.  So which is the adopter and which is the real mother, Diyose or Carter?  Ultimately the term Guardian legitimately applies to both.  Sit back (if you're not on the edge of your seat!), disengage brain and enjoy.",1434240000,5,1782,4.887043189368771

8664105,3,B00L6AW2EA,"In all honesty this gets three stars because I love action movies. So let me get the negatives out of the way first. The storyline is bad and the script is even worse. Some of the lines are truly annoying but I bought this for the fight scenes only and I didn't expect anything else. The action sequences were varied with car chases, gun fights and hand to hand combat. So the fights were plentiful and most of them were decent. So if it comes on television and you like action films it is worth the watch.",1423872000,,506,4.22680412371134
8664106,2,B00L6AW2EA,"The film opens with a 5 minute fight sequence. I thought I was watching a Cato vs. Clouseau fight until one got killed. We jump to the future where a girl is learning martial arts...for ""that day"" while a criminal is being transported and escapes. The two subplots quickly slam back together as we get 50 minutes of fighting and car crashes and having little to no idea what the movie is about. Then the film pauses and confirms our first guess from the meager clues then goes into a flashback which explains it all, including the opening scene. This was rather boring stuff, so the film goes back to shooting, tossing in some bad choreographed hand to hand stuff.

The film was shot in Jakarta, Indonesia a place where dubbed English is the official language (computer screens in English too) and some of the dubbing was done in an echo chamber. If watching people shoot at each other with automatic weapons at close range and only extras getting hit, this film has it and more.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Plenty of shooting and car crashes. As a martial arts film it left much to be desired.",1422662400,9,1100,4.522613065326633
