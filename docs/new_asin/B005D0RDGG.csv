8466134,3,B005D0RDGG,"The Finnish auteur Aki Kaurismki has essentially made the same kind of film over and over again: against a muted colour palette, Finnish actors recite their lines with the most robotic of deadpan delivery. Though these films are set in the present day, at some point an oldies band will appear on a stage playing rockabilly, Finnish tangos or other music of the 1950s. Already these elements add up to something absurd, but with the Leningrad Cowboys films, which Criterion has released here in its budget series Eclipse, Kaurismki ventured much further into the inexplicably odd.

As LENINGRAD COWBOYS GO AMERICA (1994), the first film, opens, we are ""somewhere in the tundra"" of Siberia. We meet the Leningrad Cowboys, an extravagantly quiffed Russian troupe of musicians with no following besides the mute village idiot, Igor. Furthermore, one of their members froze to death the previous night when he stayed outside rehearsing. Unable to make it in their home country, this Russian band -- which is in fact played by Finnish actors who could never pass as Russians (they even speak Finnish to each other before the film switches to English-language dialogue) -- sets out for America with their fallen bandmate in a coffin. After they arrive in New York, they are booked for a wedding in Mexico, necessitating a cross-country drive where they perform in a series of shabby bars across the Deep South. They are led by their manager Vladimir (Matti Pellonp), who spends their meagre earnings on luxury for himself while starving the band. Unbeknownst to them, the village idiot Igor, who aspires to be one of them, has arrived in the United States too in pursuit.

The America shown in this film is much like in the early work of Kaurismki's fellow filmmaker Jim Jarmusch (and indeed Jarmusch makes a cameo as a used car salesman and Kaurismki borrows elements of Jarmusch's film MYSTERY TRAIN that was being shot at the same time in Memphis). The film renounces the glamorous locations seen in Hollywood films for a backdrop of overgrown vacant lots, rusting junkyards and small-town bars full of lower-class drunks. The film is a series of vignettes preceded by title cards, and in each one the band is in a different place than in the last as they work their way towards Mexico. Kaurismki pays homage to the American blues and rockabilly tradition by casting Duke Robillard and Colonel Robert Morris in small parts.

The second film, LENINGRAD COWBOYS MEET MOSES (1994), follows closely on the action of the first film, as Vladimir reappears after an unexplained absence, having become an extravagantly bearded religious fanatic and calling himself Moses. Their former manager wants to lead the band, who have become stranded in Mexico, back to their home in Siberia. This sequel has the same general format as its predecessor, though this time the road trip is from France back through Europe to the Russian border. Vladimir has stolen something important, and French actor Andr Wilms plays an American CIA agent pursuing him on the road back home (his thick French accent again clashing with his character's supposed origin). A much more sombre effort than the first, LENINGRAD COWBOYS MEET MOSES is also among Kaurismki's worst films.

In this era when goofy humour that evokes laughs but has little re-watch value is instantly available on the web, LENINGRAD COWBOYS GO AMERICA no longer feels like such the essential viewing that critics in decades past called it. If you are a fan of Kaurismki's aesthetics, you'll probably enjoy seeing it once, but even during that first viewing you're probably likely to shake your head at the goofiness and low-budgetness of it all while occasionally chuckling.

Besides the two feature films we get TOTAL BALALAIKA SHOW, a concert video of a 1993 live performance that the Leningrad Cowboys (who included some really talented musicians, not just actors playing underdogs) gave in Helsinki with the Alexandrov Red Army Choir and Ballet. It documents an interesting period in Eastern European history, when Soviet-era troupes who once offered patriotic fare and drew decent state salaries were now hurting for cash, ready to collaborate with any Western paying customer who came along. Thus the Alexandrov Red Army Choir performs not only some sentimental Russian folk material, but American rock songs like ""Sweet Home, Alabama"". The clash of Western (or at least non-aligned Finnish) capitalism and Soviet militaristic fashion excess is striking, but again, this has not dated well.

Like usual in Criterion's budget series Eclipse, there are no extras here. The DVD transfer is unobjectionable, but Kaurismki was aiming for a drab and grainy look anyway. All in all, I'd recommend this really to committed Kaurismki films who are interested in exploring his whole output, but I'd be wary of recommending it to a general audience. Still, three stars for the risk of liking it or hating it.",1431475200,,4938,5.052760736196319

8466139,3,B005D0RDGG,"""Above all, a very muted, subdued, and dry experience in its own right but stylistically intriguing as a whole. After viewing Kaurismaki's Le Havre, his most recent cinematic effort, Leningrad Cowboys, along with Ariel and Juha, is considered one of his most notable works during his career. First off, the film deals with a Russian folk music band touring the United States after losing a contract and fan-base in their home country.

The film, despite its potential snafus to certain audiences, is neither pro-Communist nor spoken in Russian or Finnish (given the director's homeland) with English subtitles but in seldom-used, broken English for the most part with some Mexican Spanish. Aside from that, the stylistic factor is notified by its distant humour and dialogue where much of the comedy and irony comes from the small things they say and the mildly zany things (particularly tame material for a PG-13 film) they do like leave a member of their band to be in a bed of ice with his bass guitar, look at pictures of elderly Russian women out of romantic feelings, or revolt against their secretly greedy band leader. Le Havre, in comparison, is a little more obvious and timed precisely than Leningrad's more freeform aspects.

While the film can be seen at parts as purely hilarious (in a dry manner), the whole film is too spare and slow to be considered a classic or re-watchable especially in the YouTube era of fast-paced comedy. Interesting effort in cross-continental cinema but not entirely a glourious cult effort that The Criterion Collection puts it out as.""",1363219200,3,1579,4.9772727272727275

Unfortunately the Criterion transfers are below par, the picture is soft and the colors weak. The Finnish PAL releases are noticably better. Only in the subtitles do Criterion excell. They offer the choice of full subtitles whereas the Finns only subtitle the Finnish language parts. As visitors to Finland will know the Finnish accent is a bit different and the Criterion titles do help.",1330300800,3,488,5.037037037037037
