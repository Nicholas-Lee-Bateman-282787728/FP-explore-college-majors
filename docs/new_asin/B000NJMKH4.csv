8472149,1,B000NJMKH4,"Let me first say that this dvd is a compliation of 2 vhs tapes so the $30 price tag is not totally unwarranted. However I thought the material was geared towards instruction when in fact it is just a seminar and demonstration of drills on the first form but does not even attempt to teach you the form. In fact when showing the complete form the camera angle changes quickly if as to not give one a complete view of the form so one could just practice what one could make out. In addition I don't know how fair it is to claim that many instructors contributed to the dvd when only one instructor and his student are present but the instructor did study with the other masters. But it is not like they are presented here nor is any distinction made as to one master's view versus another master.

I don't feel like I wasted my money because in the future I hope to learn the form and the information provided was quite useful but only if you know the form already.",1206489600,5,963,4.262295081967213
