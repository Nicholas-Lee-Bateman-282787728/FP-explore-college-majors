They can serve as background or foreground entertainment. I always think they would be great to play in a bar or at a party.  They have a tendency to draw you in.  Very easy to watch and full of inspiration.",1355270400,,385,4.457142857142857

8415333,5,B003TO5J4G,"OK, I'm biased--I made this disc. (Full disclosure, right?)

I shot these films in 2003 as a response to living, as a way of reminding myself of the good times, the beauty, the absurdity--all fueled by an insatiable visual curiosity about the world around me.

I did it to entertain myself and my friends. Like my friends, the clips are pretty, funny, and weird.

There are 777 in 2 hours exactly, which means the average length of each is about 10 seconds.

You can watch 'em with the sound up, or turn it down and put on your favorite music. It works like magic with anything.

The disc loops, so it works great as background party visuals.

I've screened these films scores of times and they still hold my interest. Perhaps this is mere narcissism, but I'd be most grateful if you checked 'em out and shared your thoughts here.",1308009600,,830,4.5
