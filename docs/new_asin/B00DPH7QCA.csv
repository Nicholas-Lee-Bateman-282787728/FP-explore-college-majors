5841151,5,B00DPH7QCA,"Having grown up with this album and being especially influenced by these artists as a young musician, I was both eager and skeptical of this release, but decided to pull the trigger and hope that ammo wasn't wasted. It far exceeded my expectations by a longshot, and all true aficionados of music should be required to own this DVD. Not just watch it, but give it repeated listenings - it's the best music DVD I've seen since 'Jeff Beck - Live at Ronnie Scotts' from a few years ago. Yup, it's that good.

Both McLaughlin and Carlos are in top form, and instead of each playing a set with their own bands and unifying for an overbloated finale (like a lot of these concert pairings), both bands are blended (I'll refrain from using the word 'Fused') throughout the concert without the potentially disasterous clashing of musical egos and artistic overarching from guys of this caliber. Roles are established and egos kept checked until your space was allotted, at which point you could break loose and raise hell, which happened frequently.

What also thrilled me was the selection of tracks - in addition to the classic 'Love, Devotion, Surrender' tracks and reprise, we're treated to compositions by John Coltrane, Bob Dylan, Miles, Led Zep, Pharoah Sanders, Wayne Shorter, Sonny Sharrock and Tony Williams Lifetime, which was the highpoint for me. Here, Cindy Blackman channeled Tony like no one else could (she was his student) and gave McLaughlin the kick in the ass he needed to resurrect some of the blistering, visceral psych-acid-jazzrock fretwork we don't always hear from him anymore. Two astonishing tracks worth the price alone. And don't get me started on Cindy's drum solo, another tribute to her mentor Tony Williams, who Santana calls ""probably the greatest drummer who ever lived"" - this said in front of his newlywed wife, the best female drummer on the planet (at least the one I live on)! I felt sorry for Dennis Chambers, another monsterous skinbasher, who was relegated to Cindy's shadow most of the night.

I could go on, but 'There Comes A Time' when you no longer need to convert the musical mind - if you love great guitarists, virtuoso musicians, near-flawless vocabulary and execution, perfect pacing and performances by egoless giants, and just want to sit mesmerized with the cat-who-just-ate-the-canary look on your face, you need this, as in yesterday. This is your 'Invitation'.",1377216000,49,2412,4.950617283950617
5841152,3,B00DPH7QCA,Yeah I downloaded this for 10 dollars from Eaglerock and I watched it once I might have to watch it more...But I don't know what to think of this performance I think the idea of them playing together sounded better than the performance. John is definitely up there trying to enjoy himself. Where Carlos just seems to be full of himself a little I still don't know if John intimidates him or not... his wife there might of distracted his focus. They could of come up with a more spiritual set list...what I'm not sure. All I know is I love that album they made in 1973 and I might have to see if I have concerts from that tour. They were definitely different people back in 1973. Also John doesn't use a amp anymore it's all laptop computer stuff into the monitors so it has artificial balls. The best part of the show was the material of the 73 album and the lifetime tunes. The rest of it I don't know it's very good. It might one of those moments the more I watch or listen it will grow on me. But not as fast as LOVE DEVOTION SURRENDER and John and Carlos's work during the 1970's.,1377216000,7,1084,4.216346153846154
5841153,5,B00DPH7QCA,"Finally this historic performance is available via the great Live At Montreux series. Whenever these two guitar maestros and searching souls meet a special kind of magic ensures.

And here they are supported by a stellar cast mainly from Santana's regular band although McLaughlin bassist Etienne M'Bappe definitely plays a prominent role. On drums Cindy Blackman Santana and Dennis Chambers drives things forward with power and finesse together with conga legend Raul Rekow. And 'new' Santana keyboard player David Matthews really impresses with both versality and inventiveness.

Even though the repertoire comprises 4 tracks from the classic ""Love, Devotion, Surrender"" album the atmosphere is far from their short legendary tour of 1973. Less fiery guitar-battles and more subdued, but sublime interplay. Among the highlights in this very diverse set is 2 tracks from Lifetime propelled by Cindy (as in her excelent 'tribute' band&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spectrum-Road/dp/B007G9OO4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spectrum Road</a>) and a rare chance to hear McLaughlin visiting his avantgardish (acidy) past. And some sublime acoustic guitar duets.

As must be the case with a 'rehearsed jamsession' like this there are some miscues and warts but that only add to the charm of this highly recommendable concert that really lives up to it's name, inviting us to spiritual and musical illumination.",1377043200,19,1448,5.951923076923077
5841154,5,B00DPH7QCA,"John McLaughlin and Carlos Santana re-united after almost 40 years for this one-off performance at the 2011 Montreux Jazz Festival, here offered in all its visual and sonic glory on Blu-Ray (the audio performance is also available as a 2x CD set).

Fans of these two guitar virtuosos and of jazz fusion in general will inevitably compare this performance to the iconic 1972 studio album Love Devotion Surrender and to a lesser degree, the epic performance of Flame Sky on Santanas 1973 jazz-themed album Welcome. Many pieces from the 1972-73 sessions are revisited in the Montreaux performance, plus some new stuff including tributes to Miles Davis, Tony Williams and (surprisingly) a strikingly different take on Led Zeppelins Stairway to Heaven.

McLaughlin & Santana are a formidable duo who obviously enjoy playing together and inspire each other. The band is good too, with two drummers (one is Cindy Blackman, Carlos new wife who delivers a full-on percussive blitz-of-a-solo late in the concert), further percussion as in the classic Santana band line-up, competent keyboards and two alternating bass players. Carlos wears a white suit and hat and John a white shirt with black pants, so they even still look like the clean-cut 1970s guitar virtuosos on their spiritual path. Carlos seems to act as default Master of Ceremonies and musical conductor for the occasion, and both look to be enjoying themselves immensely. One thing of which I was previously unaware is that John McLaughlin is a fluent French speaker as he chats away to the audience and makes jokes in French, obviously a man of many talents.

Highlights:  Let Us Go into the House of the Lord, and a sublime acoustic set with John playing an acoustic guitar miked through the soundbox and Carlos playing semi-acoustic, perched on stools like a pair of folkies.

This Montreux performance is not a reprise of the 1972 studio album: were in a different age and time, with different accompanying musicians and largely different material. My advice is to enjoy it for what it is: a fine live-on-stage performance by two great musicians, still at the top of their game after all these years. If you're a fan of the jazz fusion genre, you're going to love it.

The sound and visual quality of the performance cant be faulted at any level: its as near to perfection as the technology allows.

Minor gripes: the film editing hops around too much between the various musicians onstage and doesnt focus on anyone for more than a few seconds. Obviously with the performance filmed by cameras from several angles, a lot of material was available and choices had to be made, but the result could have been better (I was left musing what a master film maker/editor like Martin Scorsese might have done with the material, as inspired rock/jazz concert footage is one of his specialities). Also the new-agey spiritual undertone of the occasion  including the cringe-inducing singing/chanting  may not be to every viewers taste.

That said this film deserves five stars for so many reasons, not the least of which is the overall quality of the performance and the feel-good factor on this unique historic occasion.",1463875200,,3169,4.984848484848484

5841162,4,B00DPH7QCA,"The musical performances are pure genius, but what happens at the microphone forces me to give this video only 4 stars. McLaughlin and Santana play better than ever, and the band, including Cindy Blackman Santana on drums, are superb. But the embarrassing gushing at the microphone makes this less than a perfect home concert experience. The video starts with Claude Nobs gushing on to the comatose audience for about three minutes, and then McLaughlin opens his mouth and gushes in French for another minute. Then, finally, the incredible music begins. Later, Santana,  gushing about how he and McLaughlin share a 'spiritual resonance', compares himself to Mother Theresa, Desmond Tutu, and the Dalai Lama without batting an eye. It's always better when Santana just lets his guitar do the talking. Then, later, McLaughlin, totally inept at making a joke, manages to insult the audience when he indicates they're going back 150 years to play a Tony Williams number. Huh? That would be 1861, right, John? While his introduction is incomprehensible, the song is fantastic, but I was still cringing at McLaughlin's words. And, then in a later intro, McLaughlin can't remember the name of the song, very awkward, very self-indulgent, and then, sadly, he remembers the name of the painfully naive song with the dumbest lyrics of all time: ""The Creator Has a Master Plan"" ('peace and happiness for every man!').  Again, I wish they'd just let their axes do the talking, because it is scintillating playing. But. when they open their mouths, it reminds me that their thoughts ain't as profound as their licks...and that detracts from the viewing/listening experience. How's about a remake minus the talking?",1436054400,3,1701,5.137184115523466
5841163,5,B00DPH7QCA,"The original pairing of these two phenomenal musicians in 1973 produced a record (Love, Devotion and Surrender) that inspired countless guitarists (myself included) to reach for the stars musically and it remains today a high-water mark of the fusion era. Criticized at the time for what some deemed excessive showboating on the part of the principals and as pretentious and self-consciously holier-than-thou in the overtly religious/spiritual aura that pervades both the material and the packaging, the music is what matters here, and both Carlos Santana and John McLaughlin clearly poured their whole hearts and exceptional playing skills into the record. The finest original composition and performance on LDS, McLaughlin's ""The Life Divine"" opens this tremendous concert, and although it lacks some of the fire of the original, is nevertheless played by the superb ensemble assembled for the show with full respect for the composition and also with some degree of restraint from the two guitarists, particularly McLaughlin, who in fact does not really let himself go until near the end of the show. In addition to most of the material from LDS, the concert also features excellent readings of music from the catalog of Lifetime, the great, star-crossed pre-Mahavishnu band of great drummer Tony Williams where McLaughlin earned his spurs, Miles Davis' ""Right Off"" and ""Black Satin"" and even a medley that includes renditions of Bob Dylan's ""A Hard Rain's A Gonna Fall"" and the Led Zeppelin icon ""Stairway to Heaven"" as elements. Santana's performance is particularly enjoyable, as it is obvious from the beginning he's having a marvelous time. His wife Cindy Blackman Santana is part of the ensemble on drums and performs wonderfully, getting off a really fine solo towards the end of the performance that reflects both her love of and influence by the playing of Williams as well as her own stellar chops. The rest of the band is equally skilled and plays the demanding music with passion and precision, providing a firm foundation for the two guitarists. Given McLaughlin's known reluctance to revisit his own musical past, it is a real treat to hear him playing this music again. Recorded and edited with typical perfection by the fine folks at Eagle Vision, who really are in a league by themselves when it comes to music video, this concert is absolutely essential viewing for all fans of great fusion music and highly recommended.",1435190400,3,2440,5.148614609571789

I apologize to all Santana's fans but my impression is that Carlos was intimidated by John's presence. John McLaughlin plays contained for the most part acknowledging  this is Santana's show but close to the end of the concert John jumps the fence and shows everyone  who's boss! Carlos can't keep up with McLaughlin's  edge and overall superior musicianship.

5841171,5,B00DPH7QCA,"I'm revising my original review but maintaining the 5 star status based on having watched the concert a second time while paying attention to both the demeanor and artistry of John McLaughlin and Carlos Santana. This is an event of positive attitude and brilliant performances from each of the featured artists, as well as the performance of the band as a whole. My initial thought, upon watching the concert the first time, was that Carlos Santana did not show up to play and the perception was that he had a seriously negative attitude. I admit that I was wrong in that assessment and enjoyed the concert immensely the second time around. The five star rating is well deserved as John and Carlos are joyful and their exuberance is especially noticeable in the trading of solos and the working of the already enthusiastic crowd. It is a joyous celebration of music and spirituality and reminiscent of the times I have seen Santana live dating back to the Welcome album. John and Carlos have put their collective best efforts forward displaying their technical ability and musical sensibilities as artists and it is fortunate that their collaboration was captured on film. I would recommend this concert to anyone who is a McLaughlin and Santana enthusiast because they will readily understand the musical and spiritual bond between these two incredible guitarists.",1415059200,4,1365,5.0176211453744495
5841172,3,B00DPH7QCA,"While it showcases both star guitarists' technical prowess, the performances heighten the different paths each took after their seminal ""Love, Devotion and Surrender"" album. John has moved from the high-octane jazz-rock of the '70s to a more seasoned standards axeman. Meanwhile, Carlos veered into pop-rock, his licks largely remaining the same since the aforementioned album; so much so that John plays figure eights around him without trying. Of course the pop audience seem oblivious of that, but that's for another forum.

This is Santana's show. John should have just made a guest appearance and blow the roof off playing the entire L,D&S set.",1414368000,2,649,5.300970873786408

5841177,5,B00DPH7QCA,"This is a must-have for all guitar friends, jazz fans and of course, Coltrane fans. The jamming is wonderful. Think about how complex some of the rhythms and textures are here, and you'll get what I'm saying. After all, most of it is John Coltrane's works, (you know ""Love, Devotion and Surrender"" was a historic album, don't you, when it came out! Well, this is the ""Live"" version! ) but other artists' compositions are treated well here, also.( Marvin Gaye, Led Zeppelin, Pharaoh Sanders, Sonny Sharrock)  The songs are glorious. The rapport is genuine and healthy and everyone has a great time. Lots of smiling, laughter, even. Joy! Don't let off-putting 3 and 4-star folks try to sway you, although they are entitled to their say. For me, as a guitarist, seeing these two giants play together is astonishing. Having Etienne M'Bapp playing bass is a wonderment of grand imagination, as he is a star in his own right. Especially watch his solo near the end of this set. Take a look at the playing by Dennis Chambers and the young Cindy Santana on drums, the wonderful conga percussion by Paul Rekow, and superb keyboard playing by David K. Matthews. Vocalists Tony Lindsay and Andy Vargas are also there with Tommy Anthony on guitar and Benny Rietveld on bass to complete the band. The acoustic version of ""Naima"" is one of the prettiest tunes in all of jazz. Try to play it, if you can, like they do. Challenging, but so very nice. They offer a tribute to drummer Tony Williams that John played with and who died shortly before this set was filmed. Finally, they salute Claude Nobs, the founder of Montreux Jazz Festival, who has since passed away as well. They even let him jam on blues harp toward the end. I would have liked to have been there. I am so very glad I own this, and to see this is a real treat. Not to be missed and highly recommended. A great show!",1404864000,2,1868,4.543026706231454

There is only one very small segment that I don't like and it's not the music of Carlos or John.  I won't list it here, but for those of you who buy this, you may or may not see it.",1394928000,,451,4.079545454545454
5841181,2,B00DPH7QCA,"Sorry but I was very disappointed with this Blu-Ray. Perhaps my expectations were too high? Carlos and John are  two of the greatest guitarists of all time. I therefore expected to be blown out of my chair by this concert. Instead I watched them go through the motions and wondered what happened. It sounded as if they had met for the first time and decided to have a loosely structured jam session with no previous rehearsal. The performance is loose which in it itself is not a bad thing but it just sounds very uninspired and thrown together to me. I have seen both of these men in concert fairly recently and they both play as well as they ever did so why this DVD is so disappointing is a mystery to me.  Perhaps the material was part of the problem? Remember that scene in ""Wayne's World?""  No Stairway fellas! No Stairway!

Anyway no harm no foul. I still love both of these master musicians and if I had a chance to see them play live together I would jump at the chance.  But my feeling about this particular performance was just kind of ""meh"".

If I might make a suggestion to fans of jazz rock fusion there is a new band out there called ""The Aristocrats"".  Their guitarist Guthrie Govan is one of the most amazing players I have heard in a very long time! Check out their DVD ""Boing We'll Do It Live!"" and you will see what I mean.

5841192,4,B00DPH7QCA,"I just finished watching this DVD a couple of nights ago.  I watched it in two sessions since it was too long to hold my interest for the entire 2+ hours.  I'm a huge fan of both of these two gentlemen and have been for nearly half a century (man, time sure flies).  I bought the ""Love, Devotion & Surrender"" album back when it came out in the early 70's and I must've listened to it nearly a thousand times.  I even have a couple of bootleg CDs from the short concert tour that that band did back in 1973, as well as a bootleg CD or two of outtakes and rehearsals from the ""Love, Devotion & Surrender"" album.

So when this DVD became available I was eager to see and hear it.  I had already seen Santana and McLaughlin reunited on the DVD ""Hymns for Peace"" from 2004.  Overall, I'd say that I enjoyed both videos.  I can understand why some other reviewers here say they found this one to be a bit boring.  I was a bit bored at first too, but after I made myself accept it for what it is rather than what I had hoped for I got into it more.

Here's some random impressions I took away from watching it:

- Nobody breaks a sweat in this video.  I might have seen a few beads of sweat on the last tune, but I was amazed at how relaxed everybody seemed on stage.  Maybe that's what made it seem a little boring at times.  I mean when you see the names McLaughlin and Santana you think fire ('Birds of Fire'); flames ('Flame Sky'); spicy, hot sauce with people hollering for water (well, ok, maybe not).  So you expect to see people sweating and grimacing.  There's plenty of fiery playing, though -- they just look really relaxed doing it.  Even Cindy Blackman-Santana doesn't break a sweat during her impressive drum feature.  Maybe all that meditating and stuff has them really chilled out.  At the beginning of the video most of the musicians silently take the stage without any applause or fanfare before Montreux Jazz Festival founder Claude Nobs comes out and introduces them.  Nobs also returns towards the end of the concert and plays some nice blues harmonica.

- Speaking of Cindy Blackman-Santana, I've never heard anyone sound so much like Tony Williams, both in the sound of her kit as well as her style of playing.  You can tell she was mentored by Tony.  Her playing is very strong here.

- The awesome Dennis Chambers is oddly rendered superfluous by the presence of Blackman-Santana.  He get's a short feature where he mostly just shows off his tremendous footwork.  It almost seems like he's trying NOT to upstage his boss's (Carlos) wife, which he could easily do.  Chambers also doesn't look too healthy in this video.  Has he been ill recently?  Maybe it's the glasses he's wearing that make him look older. He seems to stare straight ahead impassively and expressionless throughout the entire concert, never showing much emotion.  But he's probably always been like that.  He looks almost comatose here.

- The two bass players mostly play separately.  They are both really great players.  I never realized how good Benny Rietveld is, and he appears to be having the best time of anybody on stage.  I actually came away more impressed with him than any of the other players because I simply didn't realize what an excellent bassist he is, so it was a pleasant surprise.  And Etienne M'Bapp is a hell of a player too.  I think he's the only guy here who is in McLaughlin's current band.  The rest of the players are/were in Santana's band.  This makes the concert seem more like a Santana concert at times more than a collaboration between McLaughlin and Santana.  Another thing I noticed was that Etienne M'Bapp was wearing gloves while he played.  I've never seen a bass player do that.  And they weren't the kind of gloves with the fingertips cut off either.

- The band plays several jams that lean towards blues.  Watching them do this made me realize that blues is not McLaughlin's forte.  I'm not saying that he can't play the blues.  He obviously can play anything he feels like playing.  Maybe he doesn't feel like playing the same old blues cliches and chooses to instead superimpose his own thing over the blues rather than play straight, pure blues.  Nothing wrong with that if you like McLaughlin (and I do -- he's one of my five favorite musicians of all time).  Some blues purists would probably have a problem with it though when the band is playing the blues.

- And again, this tune selection (like the band member selection) seems to favor Carlos Santana (who has a long and deep relationship with blues music) more than John McLaughlin.  Remember, Carlos' band was originally called the Santana Blues Band.

- Just like in the ""Hymns for Peace"" concert, Carlos seems to be studiously avoiding eye contact with John.  It's kind of a curious thing to watch.  Another reviewer here wondered if Carlos was intimidated by John, and I can't help but wonder this too watching the concert.

Those are just some random thoughts/impressions on the DVD.  Overall, I enjoyed it.  I sure wish I had a video of one of the concerts from that 1973 tour with people from the ""Love, Devotion & Surrender"" album (including Larry Young, Billy Cobham, Doug Rauch and Armando Peraza).  That would really be awesome.",1384992000,5,5232,4.576508620689655
5841193,5,B00DPH7QCA,"This Blu-Ray dvd is simply one of the best music dvd's I have ever seen. As a long time fan of both McLaughlin and Santana as two of the absolute best electric guitar players ( along with Jeff Beck ), the evening of music they offer to us is at once, spiritually inspiring
(their personal joy in playing radiates from the screen), technically mindboggling, melodic, danceable, and satisfying in ways music rarely achieves. Jeff Beck Live at Ronnie Scotts is a great showcase for Jeff's music and band but this dvd possesses something very, very special in the pure joy that the entire band plays with and what a band. Everyone a top musician who plays with incredible skill. If you are at all interested in listening to the best musicians in the world in jazz, rock, and blues genres then you can't do better than this.",1384732800,6,819,4.578231292517007

5841203,3,B00DPH7QCA,"These are two of my favorite guitarists but John and Carlos seem to be on auto-pilot. The playing feels self indulgent and has a loose jam feel,almost like they know the crowd will eat it up no matter what they do. The guitar tones are too similar. Somebody needs to tell John he has two pick-ups on his guitar not to mention the numerous coil taps on his guitar. It gets boring rather quickly. They still play great,especially John. He's just as fast as ever. Maybe I'm taking these two major talents for granted but it just doesn't move me. Yawn...!",1379635200,7,551,4.465346534653466

Great band, great sound  and kudos to Mrs. Santana for great percussion work. Carlos with his little hat and searing Latin tinged blues ringing sustained riffs and Master john with his Buddha like smile and fingers all in a flurry. Who could ask for more? perhaps a song where all together they play just one note. Now, THAT would be interesting. Seriously, I liked the concert. it is what it is.

5841206,5,B00DPH7QCA,"I had the joy of seeing McLaughlin and Santana on their 1973 tour 40 years ago this week! This DVD concert recorded in 2011 is in most ways the equal of that first show, and in some ways better. I was a big fan of Mclaughlin and the Mahavishnu orchestra in the early 70s, he was in my opinion the finest guitarist on the planet, but I haven't been able to connect with anything he's done since. Here, in Montreux it's as if the spark has been relit and he plays with fire. From the first moments of The Life Divine you know that these two players haven't lost any of their talent; No one plays guitar like this any more. The interplay between the two virtuosos seems telepathic, supposed modern masters like Vai and Satriani couldn't begin to play at this level of power, emotion and fluidity. The Sonny Sharrock piece, Venus/Upper Egypt just soars and to me is the highlight of the performance.

This band doesn't have Billy Cobham on drums like the 1973 touring band, Cobham really powered the band on; but Carlos's wife, Cindy Blackman Santana, is amazingly versatile and all over those drums. The rest of the band are all fine musicians and provide a solid backdrop for the fiery guitar leads. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this show and anyone who enjoys jazz-rock fusion will love it. At a time when the airwaves are consumed with uninspired and mostly unlistenable drek that poses as music, this is a rare gem that really shines.",1378857600,17,1436,4.565891472868217

5841208,3,B00DPH7QCA,I love the content of this concert but did I get a bad copy or something? The sound and picture are out of synch. ( I have other Eagle Rock Blu-ray concerts that are fine ). Also the sound mix is not up to standard and is a bit muddy and unbalanced. Seems like they rushed this release or didn't QA it very well. I recently bought and watched the Santana ' Hymns For Peace' blu-ray and the production values are way higher on it than on this disc.

8595823,2,B00DPH7QCA,"I have numerous albums of both Santana and McLaughlin, and have enjoyed their music over the years.  Seeing Santana perform during the recent revival of his career made me feel that, in terms of artistic creativity and guitar chops, his best days were well in his past, but I hoped this DVD would prove that wrong.  By contrast, I've liked McLaughlin's more recent work more than his older work, so I hoped this DVD would showcase the latest and greatest McLaughlin.

Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed on both counts.  Santana lacks both chops and fire - I wonder if *I* might be a better guitarist than he is (I've been playing about 35 years, mainly as a hobbyist).  McLaughlin does better, and is clearly the superior guitarist of the two, but he also is not at his best for some reason, as though he needs to hold back to not show up Santana.  On top of all this, I found the song choice to be bland, and the sound quality of the guitars is also surprisingly muddy.

I can only rate this two stars right now, but will try watching it again at some point, hoping it grows on me a bit so that I can at least raise my rating to three stars.  Meanwhile, I'll continue to look for a DVD which shows McLaughlin at his best.
