4433908,5,B004MYYHG8,"Chief Justice Michael Stailey, DVD Verdict -- ""I gave up on Marvel animated adaptations way back in the early days of X-Men: The Animated Series. Sure, I tuned into the occasional revamp (The Spectacular Spider-man) or direct-to-DVD adventure (Doctor Strange: The Sorcerer Supreme), but compared with what Warner Bros. Animation was doing with the Distinguished Competition, even the most promising tales fell short. So imagine my surprise when The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes turned out to be one hell of step in the right direction. Taking the foundation of Stan Lee and Roy Thomas' earliest stories and laying them on top of a 21st century Marvel cinematic universe might seem like quiet the challenge, but veteran storyman Chris Yost and producer Josh Fine make it look easy. Forty-seven years worth of history, relationships, the character flaws are on display; with significantly more reverence than we've seen from recent series like Iron Man: Armored Adventures, Wolverine and the X-Men, and The Spectacular Spider-man. Yes, certain changes have been made (as is inevitably the case), but they aren't enough to take even the most hard core Avengers readers out of the flow of these animated adventures. Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes is not a cheap sellout by Marvel to capitalize on their theatrical films. This is a sincere love letter to fans who have followed the Avengers stories throughout the years. Depending on how long the show runs, we can only hope to see some of the genius work of writers likes Brian Michael Bendis get the animated treatment it so richly deserves.""",1305417600,,1599,5.153846153846154
4433909,4,B004MYYHG8,"It's as if there were a live action AVENGERS film coming out or something. That's when you usually get all the animated tie-in TV shows trying to feed off the buzz. Somewhere Brian Michael Bendis should be getting some royalties. The two-part debut of AVENGERS: EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES is loosely based on Bendis's ""Breakout"" arc which first introduced the New Avengers. Except that this roster doesn't include the likes of Spidey or Wolverine or Luke Cage. Instead, we get the old guard, the original Avengers. The wealthy socialite and her geeky scientist, the braggy industrial genius, the mighty god of thunder, the tormented other scientist, and, soon after, the patriotic former 98-pound weakling.

AVENGERS Vol. 1: Heroes Assemble! features seven episodes, of which the first five episodes are compiled from the 20-part micro-series which introduced the individual members, established their respective back stories, and foreshadowed several future story arcs. In these episodes, we glimpse plot elements that eventually lead into the formation of the Avengers. It's a mix and match batch, some stories inspired by classic issues and some borrowed from more recent issues or specifically written for this series. For example, how Captain America and Bucky supposedly perished from trying to diffuse a launched armed missile is classic stuff. The Hydra's substituting for the Nazis in World War II is a new twist. Also new and in keeping with the IRON MAN films, Jarvis comes in as Stark's A.I. valet, instead of being a human butler. Given Iron Man's surge in popularity, would it surprise you to learn that ol' Shellhead is prominently featured here?

""Breakout"" comprises the official first two episodes of Season One. When seventy-four super-powered inmates simultaneously  break out of four maximum security facilities, the Wasp, Ant Man,  Iron Man, Thor, and the Hulk must unite. Especially since one of these villains, the gravity-controlling Graviton, is an extinction-level power. It takes the full might of the Avengers to take down this guy. Another convenient thing regarding the mass escape is that the show now has a ready-made plot point to fall back on, in case the writers hit the wall.

The show serves up splendid fan service with its many throwaway cameos (cast your eyes on Jimmy Woo and James Howlett) and sensational action sequences. We note familiar beats, such as the theft and misuse of Iron Man's armor tech and Odin's entering of the Odinsleep, to name only two. In keeping with comic book continuity, Captain America doesn't thaw out and become an Avenger until a bit later (in Season One's Volume 2 DVD). But we do get his World War II origins on this DVD. Meanwhile, things develop, respectively, with the unerring marksman Hawkeye and the Wakandian prince, Black Panther, both of whom will soon bolster the Avengers ranks.

I liked the animation, which is well done and tailored closer to the anime style rather than, say, the more stylized visuals utilized in those Batman / Superman / Justice League TV cartoons. This series turns in some decent characterization work. I love this interpretation of the Hulk. He's neither as intellectual as Peter DAvid's Professor Hulk nor as mindless as the Lou Ferrigno version. The Hulk actually tosses out a handful of funny one-liners. Predictably, he makes for a combustible teammate. Iron Man retains just a whiff of that high and mighty demeanor which I so disliked circa Civil War, but mostly he's more an easy-going guy. One big neg is that the voice actor playing Stark doesn't carry much weight, vocally. Also, it seems like they couldn't decide on whether to go with classic whitebread Nick Fury or Ultimate Nick Fury, so they went with a mash-up. This Fury is black but sort of with classic Fury's trademark salt & pepper hair. In fact, ""mash-up"" probably describes this show best. Some stuff lifted from Stan Lee, some from Brian Michael Bendis, with these elements meshing into a solid overarching narrative, even if Hydra has no business supplanting the pound for pound best ever villains history has ever recorded. 74 super-villains on the loose (73, after this volume). Hopefully, this show's around long enough that we get to see each of them get nicked.

This DVD's bonus feature: ""New Looks, New Heroes"" - Supervising Producer Joshua Fine and Story Editor Christopher Yost present a peek at Season 2 (00:07:33 minutes long). The DVD's seven episodes:

- Episode 1 - ""Iron Man Is Born!""
- Episode 2 - ""Thor the Mighty""
- Episode 3 - ""Hulk Versus the World""
- Episode 4 - ""Meet Captain America""
- Episode 5 - ""The Man in the Ant Hill""
- Episode 6 & 7 - ""Breakout, Parts 1 & 2""",1305331200,6,4672,4.965473145780051
4433910,5,B004MYYHG8,"In short: this series, which airs on DisneyXD is a new version of the classic Avengers story. It begins with how the team was formed, but it has not, as of yet, gotten into any actual origin stories. The first12 episodes or so deal with how Iron Man (leader of the group), Thor, Ant-Man/Pym, Wasp, Hulk, Black Panther, Cpt America, and Hawkeye all meet and team up as The Avengers. the catalyst of this formation is S.H.I.E.L.D, who also plays a prominent role in the stories. After a slew of super-villains escape from their SHIELD prisons, they are led by Enchantress and Baron Zemo to wreak havoc upon America. I believe about 72 villians are featured in this gallery of rogues.
Basically, this universe is a combination of the new movies and the Ultimate comic books - Nick Fury is black, Iron Man's suit is Mark VI (Iron Man 2 had Mark V), Hulk can talk and think, Hawkeye already looks like Jeremy Renner etc etc etc.
Its a combination that works pretty well. The movie fans can get a sense of continuity, and the Ultimate versions aren't that far-off from the original classic charaters, just some minor tweaks for the sake of modernism.
I'm curious as to how this series will reflect on the Avengers movie due out next year.

So here is the key: this series is AWESOME. pretty much the best animated series on air, with Young Justice and GI:JOE Renegades making a top 3.

The animation itself is quite good. In HD, the lines are very crisp and the colours very bold and stimulating. The voiceover work is quite good, though not as good as Batman:TAS, which still sets the bar today.

I have found the stories to be excellent as well. There is alot of crossover from episode to episode, so you really must watch them in order. The plotlines are surpringly layered for a cartoon, and even some of the themes and ideas are quite adult. I found the episode featuring Simon William's transformation into Wonder Man to be harrowing; it was really awesome.

This series is great for both adults and kids aged 9+.

I haven't actually seen these DVDs, so I cannot attest to any visual or audio quality... but just by watching them as they air on DisneyXD I give it 5 stars.

This may be the best animated Marvel series ever!",1305158400,,2223,4.531172069825437
4433911,4,B004MYYHG8,"I really appreciated that the stories span individual episodes in the fashion of a normal live action TV show; each fitting in as a puzzle piece in the season long story arc.  The characters are pretty faithful and if you are a fan, you will see some familiar developments as time goes by.  I've thoroughly enjoyed every episode.

If I had to ""nit pick"", it would not be with the show itself, it's how the DVD's are being marketed.  All of the shows I love enough to buy on DVD, I purchase one season at a time, but here we have the usual Marvel nonsense.  There are 2 volumes for sale and if you buy both you will have exactly HALF of season 1.  Seriously?  I am going to have to buy 4 separate DVD's to get a single season?  That is so cheesy.  But cheese aside, this is a great show.",1305072000,2,786,4.118421052631579

I loved every bit of this new series, the animation, story lines, the keeping with the Marvel comics of the ""classic period"" the 1960's and 70's; just great stuff!!",1304985600,,312,4.672727272727273
4433913,4,B004MYYHG8,"After nearly 20 years of getting their butts kicked in the animated feature department
by Bruce Timm and the boys at DC Comics, Marvel has FINALLY produced an animated show
they can be proud of. ""The Avengers"" doesn't exactly break too much new ground, nonetheless
it is an excellent show and is a worthy counterpart to the succesful DC franchise, Justice League:

Pros: ART/ANIMATION: Animation is pretty good, though not exactly avant garde. The artwork and
  character designs are top notch. Really loved the looks they gave
  Wasp, Black Widow and Tony Stark/Iron Man. Combat sequences, especially in the last
  two episodes of the DVD, are some of the best I've seen in an animated feature to date.

  STORIES: The plot-lines are complex and engaging. The pacing is fast, the dialogue is sharp and pretty
  clever. Fair amount of humor throw in, particularly by the characters of Wasp, Iron Man and Hawkeye, although
  I would have loved to seen a little more (there isn't quite the equivalent of Justice League's Flash
  on this show).

CONS: (SOME OF) THE CHARACTERS: While characters like Iron Man, Wasp and Hawkeye are interesting and nicely fleshed out,
  there are a few disapointments: Thor, for example, came across as very bland. The ""Thor"" of the Norse Myths
  was actually a pretty fierce and wild character. I would have preferred seeing a more chaotic and untamed
  Thor rather than the square-jawed boy-scout we're presented with in this series. Captain America was also suprisingly
  dull. I was kind of hoping he would be spouting off a lot of cheesy, patronizing and yet humorous cliches
  (""Stay in school, son!"" ""I cannot stress the importance of knowing your multiplication tables!""). But no such luck :(

  LACK OF A FEMALE PRESENCE: Wasp is the only female representative on the Avengers squad, and while she is quite a
  quirky and engaging character, the series would be better served with more females both among the heroes and the villains.
  Black Widow looks like a fun character, but she only make sporadic appearances. Apparently Marvel intends to address
  this in Season Two with the introduction of Ms Marvel. Hopefully she is a strong and memorable character.

All in all, though, I really enjoyed this series. I would enthusiastically recommend it. There is a also a small preview of Season Two
included on the disc (and a first look at new characters Ms Marvel (swoon!) and Vision)), and it looks very promising.
I can't wait!",1304640000,2,2467,4.914841849148418
4433914,5,B004MYYHG8,"This DVD is full of six great super hero filled episodes, including Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and The Hulk.  My boys were not familiar with any of these characters so it was a nice change for them to watch.  My husband loved watching this DVD with them because those are all his favorite superheros.  They have never seen The Avengers before in general and were amazed at how the superheros caught the bad guys.  I was worried the animation wouldn't be the greatest since it is not a hugely popular DVD, but being made by Disney the graphics were great.  This is a great DVD for anyone, child or adult, who loves superheros or Marvel comics!

Mom and More Disclosure: I was sent this DVD to review in exchange for my honest opinion.",1304208000,,739,4.477611940298507
4433915,5,B004MYYHG8,"Being a long-time Marvel Maniac, I'm pleased to report thet this newest incarnation of ""The Avengers""
has really been a pure joy to behold. A friend of mine, from work, was the one who clued me into this
great show, and I've been hooked ever since. (*thanks, Jeff*) Although there are certain updates and liberties taken
here, Avengers still retains much of it's charm and character from it's original silver age roots. I've found The Wasp with all new charismatic attention, while The Hulk, Thor and Black Panther pretty much dead on. However, if I were to pick the one hero they did to perfection ~ in relation to his comic book counter-part ~ then it have would be ""Captain America"" hands down. Everything from character design to voice actor to script brought Cap to life better than I've ever seen it ever done before. The only negative note I have here is the actor who voices Iron Man. His voice is way too young. It's as if it were Spider-Man under the helmet instead of a worldly and mature man such as Tony Stark. Fortunately, with that one error aside, ""Earth's Mightest Heroes"" is the finest Marvel animated series to date. Now all we need is a guest appearance by Victor Von Doom and all will be right with the world.
""AVENGERS ASSEMBLE""!!! (*'nuff said*)",1304121600,2,1268,4.615044247787611
4433916,5,B004MYYHG8,"Marvel has always impressed me with its comics, animated shows, movies and more. Marvel animated cartoons have been going on since the 1960s with its 60s Spider-Man.

Many cartoons today are pretty awful. I have been closely to losing faith as cartoons today have been pretty much gone downhill. But on that day when I went to the San Diego Comic-Con and paid a visit to the Marvel booth, I saw something intriguing, a poster advertising Marvel's latest action show: Avengers:Earth's Mightiest Heroes.

Avengers:Earth's Mightiest Heroes is the latest animated series produced by Marvel. Avengers:EMH debuted on Disney XD October 20. It is far better then the god-awful Avengers cartoon from 1999 which did not get a good press. What is very odd is that when people first heard of Avengers:EMH, everone said,""oh no, this was gonna be ""too kiddy"" and not for the teens and/or adults because its on Disney XD. Those who said that were terribly mistaken. Avengers:EMH is far from ""kiddy"". In fact, it is very similar to the Batman TAS and the 90s X-Men animated series. It has recieved positive reviews from fans and good ratings. Some say it is even the 90s X-Men of this generation.

Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes follows the adventures of Marvel's greatest heroes, Iron man, Ant-Man, Wasp, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Panther and Hawkeye as they battle the most diabolical villains. The episodes are very loyal to the comics as the Avengers start off as solos but unite in the first episode and new members are added as they progress.

The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes!"" stars the well-known voice talents of Rick D. Wasserman (""Planet Hulk,"" ""Marvel Vs. Capcom 3,"" ""House M.D."") as Thor, Brian Bloom (""The A Team,"" ""Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2"") as Captain America, Fred Tatasciore (""Tron: Evolution,"" ""Hulk Vs.,"" ""Wolverine and the X-Men"") as The Hulk, Wally Wingert (""The Family Guy,"" ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"") as Ant Man, and Phil Lamarr (""Mad TV,"" ""Futurama"") as Jarvis.

If you want action, adventure and/or just simply adore Marvel, then don't miss Avengers:Earth's Mightiest Heroes. This will be a must-have for Marvel fans of all ages.

Here are the episodes in volume 1.

1. Iron Man is Born-When the villainous organization known as HYDRA attacks the United Nations, the fate of the world's leaders is in the hands of Iron Man! But Tony Stark may have met his match as HYDRA unleashes the Dreadnoughts against him, using technology that Stark created himself! Iron Man has to overcome HYDRA, but is the world peacekeeping force known as S.H.I.E.L.D. any better? Plus, S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury fights alone when the Grim Reaper infiltrates the super villain prison known as the Vault.

2. Thor the Mighty-The villainous Wrecking Crew are tearing through New York City, and the only thing that's standing in their way? The Mighty Thor! But when Thor is called back to Asgard by his father Odin, he's forced to face off against an army of Frost Giants led by the evil Loki...Thor's adopted brother. But even if Thor wins the battle, he may have lost more than he realizes, for nothing is ever as it seems with Loki.

3. Hulk vs the World-When Bruce Banner heads to Vegas to track down an escapee from the Super-Villain prison known as the Cube, he's forced to transform into the incredible HULK to take on the Absorbing Man. But to make matters worse, Thunderbolt Ross and his Hulkbusters are on the scene with orders to take the Hulk down. And even if the Hulk can defeat Absorbing Man and the Hulkbusters, can he survive SHIELD's most dangerous agents- Hawkeye and the Black Widow.

4. Meet Captain America-In the closing days of World War II, Captain America and Bucky join forces with Jack Fury and his Howling Commandos for a final confrontation with the Red Skull and his HYDRA forces! But as the battle unfolds, they're being watched by a visitor from the future. His name is Kang the Conqueror, and he's on a mission to save the world.

5. The Man in the Ant-Hill-When scientist Hank Pym obtains a rare sample of vibranium to study, the nasty villain Klaw comes to steal it- but he's not ready to enter Ant-Man's world. Then, the wondrous Wasp takes on Whirlwind. And finally, take a tour of the Big House, the world's smallest Super-Villain prison. Plus, welcome to Wakanda, the most powerful nation on Earth- you're just in time to see the fall of the Black Panther.

6. Break-Out part 1-Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Ant-Man and Wasp have defeated some of the most powerful, dangerous super-villains on the planet. And once defeated, those criminals are housed in the super-villain prisons. But now, on a day like none other, those prisons open wide, simultaneously releasing every single villain in a breakout like the world has never seen. Our heroes- only hope is to band together- to become the AVENGERS.

7. Break-Out part 2-The super-villain breakout has begun, and it's everything our heroes can do to stay alive! But when a mysterious fourth prison is revealed housing a being whose power dwarfs anything ever seen, the Avengers must join together for the first time. Because the man called Graviton is now free. He's after Nick Fury and he'll destroy the world to get to him.",1299024000,78,5226,4.865016872890888

A terrorist organization called Hydra attacks the United Nations while all of the worlds leaders are present. Tony Stark aka Iron Man, enters the scene to halt the rampage. After the skirmish, he comes to words with SHIELD commander Nick Fury, and learns that the threat of super-villains are increasing and he's only one man. As the super-villain activity increases, solo superheroes attempt to stop the madness. These random attacks are only the beginning of something larger in the works. -summary

I have to come right out the gate and admit that I was not expecting anything special with this series. Through out the years, Marvel has been very disappointing for me in regards to their animated series. The X-Men series of the early 90's was not something I looked back on with fond memories, and after revisiting it recently, it rarely impressed me. The Spider-Man Animated Series of the 90's was complete trash as far as I'm concerned. I remember not liking anything about it, this also goes for Fantastic Four as well as Iron Man. I was thisclose to writing this series off completely despite my enjoyment of both Hulk vs. and Planet Hulk; but I'm happy to share with my fellow comic geeks that The Avengers is no doubt among the best superhero animated series I've seen. I enjoyed these first seven episodes about as much as I did Justice League, and that says a whole lot, since I consider that to be one of the greatest American animated shows ever.

Released in 2010, The Avengers animated series draws influence from many different era's of the comics run. It's a joy picking out many of the references from the early comic series, recent series, and even Ultimate Universe. The Avengers is a Marvel Comics fan dream come true, and these first episodes established a very solid foundation.

The series doesn't exactly follow a steady plot. Instead, it focuses on one or even two particular characters per-episode. However, there's a subplot taking place every episode which is obviously building to something larger. Comic fans will be able to spot many of these revelations, while non fans will more than likely be in the dark yet still gripped to the stories. The episodes are well written for the most part, and consist of many over the top action scenes that didn't come off cheesy at all to me. The action is clearly the selling point and those searching solely for that will be entertained.

These first episodes take time to build the team, and not everyone is present at the very moment; in this chapter the team is made up of Iron Man, Thor, Wasp, Ant-Man, and Hulk. Each of these characters are given their own stories where they would combat some villains whom also happens to be among their major enemies in the comics. It soon becomes a who's who of characters that mainly diehard fans will recognize and go crazy about. However, I can see non fans not feeling too amped up, since most of the villains are not even developed.

The stories build up to the final two episodes which happens to be a two-parter called Breakout. This is by far the best of this group of episodes, as it features one of the most powerful, and terribly under-rated villains to come out of the pages of Avengers. I was going to give away the name, but I will let potential viewers see it for themselves.

Outside of maybe one or two animation errors; the animation is very good and runs smoothly during the battles, and man, they are just so cool to watch. The battles have the kind of style that the X-Men of the 90's wish it had. I think the battles are on the same level as Justice League. The viewer will be treated to some good choreographed fights with swift kicks, punches, and exchanges. Full contact blows straight to the face and just highly imaginative action. The Hulk takes on Absorbing Man in a very physical fight, Thor does the same against the Wrecking Crew and his brother Loki. There's just rarely a dull moment. I also have to mention that the violence isn't completely out of line, there's no blood or gore, but there are a small amount of onscreen deaths. The character designs are pretty faithful to the comic, and the Hulk is just so big, he towers over several characters. There's also a small amount of fan service delivered by the cheeky Black Widow.

I love the voice acting as well, and you can tell many of the voice actors got into their roles. Graham McTavish reprises his role as Loki from Hulk vs., and he does just as good a job. Fred Tatasciore voices the Hulk, but he's far more entertaining in his second role as a villain later on. The voice acting is solid all around and they enhance the action scenes a great deal. The sound effects are also very good during the high impact blows, and the enemies take some vicious shots from Captain America's unbreakable shield. And I just can't forget the BGM that also adds to the battles excitement. I also get into the opening theme ""Fight as One"" performed by Bad City.

Both volumes of the Avengers was a lot of fun to watch, and I can watch them again pretty easily. The only issue I can think of is that the series isn't completely newbie friendly because not all of the villains are introduced, they just come out of nowhere, and the writers seem to have thought only of the fans here. However, don't take this the wrong way, non comic fans can definitely get into the story, and I don't see any reason how come children can't watch it either. In closing, I think this is an excellent series at this point and all fans of animation should give it a try. This first volume is 161 minutes.

Pros: Lots of action, animation, voice acting

Cons: Not completely newbie friendly",1428537600,,5688,4.605133267522211

The episodes do a good job of combining old school references to the original comic book heroes with a post-modern sensibility. Like the Marvel Cinematic Universe that is slowly being revealed with each new Marvel movie, the episodes of THE AVENGERS: EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES, VOLUME 1 are ok as stand-alone episodes, but work best when watched in order as a series: the individual episode stories are part of a much larger story arc. The animation isn't bad: it's not Pixar, but it is a step above animated tv action shows from the 1980s, e.g. G.I. JOE. The seven episodes in the volume are:

1. ""Iron Man Is Born!"" - this isn't an origin story as it's made clear in this episode that Iron Man has already been around for a while. Iron Man confronts Hydra soldiers. Maria Hill and Nick Fury are introduced.

2. ""Thor the Mighty"" - this episode introduces Thor. He meets Jane Foster and becomes smitten with her. Meanwhile, Loki partakes in mischief back in Asgard.

3. ""Meet Captain America"" - during WWII, Captain America leads the Howling Commandos into a Hydra castle.

4. ""The Man in the Ant Hill"" - this episode introduces Dr. Henry Pym as Ant Man and his girlfriend Janet Van Dyne. In a substory, the Black Panther is introduced.

5. ""Breakout, Part 1"" - all three of the super prisons of S.H.I.E.L.D. (the Vault, the Cube, and Big House) breakdown and all the criminals escape. Iron Man, Ant Man, Wasp, Thor, and the Hulk join together to round them up.

6. ""Breakout, Part 2"" - a really, really big baddie, Graviton is out on the loose and wants his revenge against Nick Fury. The Avengers come together to fight this mega-threat together.

I'm not sure why the first season was broken down into four sets, but I really enjoyed THE AVENGERS: EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES, VOLUME 1 and can't wait to see what happens next in Vol. 2. Overall, THE AVENGERS: EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES, VOL. 1 is an entertaining cartoon and a good way to introduced people unfamiliar with the comics (or now the huge movie) to the characters.",1392422400,2,2135,4.7077747989276135

But upon closer examination, you will find somthing that only gets better as it goes. Now ill admit, it does start off slow and you may have a lot of questions, but rest asured they will be answerd. For those of you who don't know, the first 5 episodes premired online as to set up the characters. Perfect. Now we have more time for story development in the first broadcast episode, Breakout. Now this show was superb writing throught and it really sucks you into the world and story. As for the characters, they nailed Tony Stark. I like this interpritation of the Hulk (As different as it may be). Thor is likeable as is Captain America. They got him good too! This show also made me like Hawkeye, Wasp, and especialy Antman more than I would have. $15 is a little steep but for this show, its worth it. If your a fan of anything marvel, i would check it out. Oh and i should mention on last thing, the music. The intro is as flawlessly entertaining as the show. As i said it is a little slow at the beginning. It picks up at Episode 3 & 4, and again at 6-7. All in all this show is a 10/10 from a 15 year old hardcore Marvel fanboy. R.I.P Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes :/",1373155200,6,1309,4.236

4433954,5,B004MYYHG8,"When I heard about the new Avengers cartoon, I just had to see it & it is good.  I still like the one from the 90s (it reminds me of Justice League Unlimited, the way they gave lesser characters time in the spotlight), but I have to admit this is more representative of the comics.  I really wish we had gotten a series like this during the 90s, but oh well.  The synopsizes come from Wikipedia.

1.  Iron Man is Born:  Iron Man saves the world's leaders from a HYDRA attack on the United Nations.  A great first episode for my favorite Avenger.  A+

2.  Thor the Mighty:  Thor is summoned to defend Asgard from an army of Frost Giants, led by Loki.  Also great.  A

3.  Hulk vs. the World:  Hulk faces the Absorbing Man, then SHIELD agents Hawkeye & Black Widow.  An interesting take on the Hulk.  A-

4.  Meet Captain America:  In World War II, Captain America leads an assault on a HYDRA facility.  My favorite of the origin episodes, for the Wolverine cameo alone.  A+

5.  The Man in the Ant Hill:  Ant-Man stops Klaw from stealing a rare sample of vibranium, then he & the Wasp defeat Whirlwind.  My least favorite of the origin episodes, but it's not bad.  B+

6-7.  Breakout:  A mass breakout occurs at each of the four supervillain prisons.  This is the best episode on the disc.  A+

So overall I am impressed.  As good as it is I do an issue.  The voice acting is good, but I really liked the ones for the older shows better.  John-Rhys Davies was a great Thor, Lou Ferrigno is the Hulk, but the voice I missed the most was Robert Hays' Iron Man.  This new guy is a bit too nasal for my tastes.  Now don't get me wrong it's definitely worth buying, but I have to admit I still wish it had been in the old Marvel Animated continuity.  But that's just my opinion.",1368662400,,1772,4.219879518072289

4433958,4,B004MYYHG8,"I freely admit that I have never read an ""Avengers"" comic book. All my experience with the Marvel universe comes from wikipedia and the live-action movies.

So I was a little uneasy when first checking out ""The Avengers: Volume One - Heroes Assemble!"" This cartoon is... not really based on either the movies or comics, but borrows liberally from both (this Tony Stark is essentially a less witty version of Robert Downey Jr.'s character). And lest noobies not know what's going on, most of the episodes in this volume are devoted to introducing the titular Avengers.

The first several episodes are devoted to introducing the main characters:
*Tony Stark is enraged when he finds out that supervillains are stealing his tech to make deadly robots.
*Thor grapples with his responsibilities to Asgard and Midgard, as well as thwarting his brother Loki's invasion. *Prince T'Challa of Wakanda escapes his country after a treacherous coup.
*Size-changing scientist Hank Pym is dragged into crime-fighting by his chipper girlfriend Janet.
*Bruce Banner's attempts to help another radiation-charged fugitive backfire, leading to SHIELD and the Hulkbusters trying to nab him.
*SHIELD archer Clint Barton becomes suspicious of his longtime partner Natasha, and shadows her on a secret mission. Things don't go well.
*And many decades in the past, Captain America and his loyal band of commandos went after a secret Hydra base, where a gateway to another world was being opened.

And once we're done with all that, things inevitably start going wrong -- a mass breakout from four separate supervillain prisons leaves SHIELD badly crippled, and countless dangerous criminals on the loose. The worst is Graviton, a crazed ex-scientist who controls gravity. The only hope for stopping him is a motley band of superheroes... Avengers, assemble!

""The Avengers: Volume One - Heroes Assemble!"" is a pretty decent introduction to the Marvel Universe, especially for people who don't know a lot about it. While some parts of the story are not sufficiently explained (what is SHIELD exactly?), it does an excellent job introducing the viewers to the characters individually, and setting up the proverbial pieces on the chessboard.

It also lays down some ongoing subplots -- Black Widow's treachery, Baron Strucker, Loki's schemes, andthe time-traveling Kang'sobsession with Captain America (whom he thinks is responsible for his timeline's erasure). But the real focus here is on getting the Avengers together, primarily by introducing a villain so crazy and violent that all of them are needed to finally take him out.

It does have some flaws, however. One of the big problems is that SHIELD comes across as so incompetent that I'm amazed they can tie their own shoes. Nick Fury seems like the only one with any brains or common sense.

As for the familiar characters, they're pretty well introduced -- Thor is a big enthusiastic lug, Tony Stark is a less witty/quirky version of Robert Downey Jr., the Hulk is a green giant who smashes, etc. But the cartoon also does a great job of introducing less well-known characters, such as the stubbornly pacifistic Ant-Man and the wronged African prince Black Panther.

""The Avengers: Volume One - Heroes Assemble!"" is a solid introduction to this animated series, even for people who are just getting into the Marvel Universe. Assemble!",1361750400,,3366,5.174632352941177

4433969,5,B004MYYHG8,"Best animated series to date.
Pros: Each hero is given an in-depth character treatment. It is a great introduction for anyone unfamiliar with the Avengers. It takes until the final episode on volume one for the team to assemble. The threads of multiple plot arcs are woven throughout the series. Each episode is a real gem. Marvel villains are the best in the history of comics, and the Avengers are plagued by some of the most powerful.
Cons: The series isn't perfect. It is cool they showed how Nick Fury's hair turned partially white, but in a flashback to Graviton's origin years earlier his hair was also white. Animation is such a time consuming process, at first I wondered how they missed that. Then I realized there are so many people working on a series like this the animator was probably working from a Nick Fury style sheet and was likely unaware of the timeline for the scene. This is nit-picking and doesn't detract from how good the series is. I wish they would have issued the complete first season in one package.

However I regained my senses long enough to yell:

""Villain!  I say to the... NAY!""

I then swiftly smote him with a most powerful strike from Mjolnir hoping to vanquish my foe with a single blow, but alas the God of Mischief was not finished yet.  Having fought through the screening forces of Loki, the Warriors Three again were by my side.  However, Loki was not without staunch allies of his own as Amora, The Executioner, and Ulik made haste to face off against us. With the gates of Valhalla yearning to claim us, my only response was to utter ""Brazen ones, prepare to defend thyselves! Have At Thee!"" as The Three and I leapt into battle.

This is clearly Marvel's best effort to date in the realization of the Marvel Universe in an ongoing series.  For those who have followed the Marvel Universe for years this is a welcome treatment of all of these characters.  Each of the Avengers has his/her own motivation and contribution to the plot.  As viewers, we get to see not only the threads of their individual stories, but how the threads intertwine and dovetail one into another.  It is obvious that the creators of this series have respect and appreciation for their art, for these characters and for the vast treasure of plots that have been developed by Stan Lee and company through the years. They have done a superb job of combining robust action and providing a ""kid-friendly"" presentation.  Marvel has set the bar high with this series.  After viewing both volumes one and two one can easily and optimistically anticipate the continuance of a fantastic effort.
