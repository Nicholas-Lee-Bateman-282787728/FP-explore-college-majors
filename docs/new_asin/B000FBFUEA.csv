2559836,5,B000FBFUEA,"Jari Love has a great workout in that you are hitting more then one muscle group with each set you do.  You can go heavier or no weight at all and still get a great workout.  The high reps and change of pace is a great motivator and one that nets wonderful results.  You should never get bored doing this workout.  The pace is varied so that you are changing things up through out the workout.  I love the fact that not only am I working my muscles and building more definition but I'm also getting a great cardio workout at the same time.  You will definitely sweat doing this workout.  I'd recommend this to intermediate as well as advanced exercisers due to the fact each set has someone doing the heavier more advanced version while someone else does the intermediate version.  Lots of variety and a really great workout.

2559837,5,B000FBFUEA,"This is an excellent workout for me as an individual wanting to define my body by burning the fat, sculpting the muscles without bulking up and become stronger with every workout. I find this DVD challenging and when I combine it with the Slim & Lean DVD I feel as if every muscular cell in my body is getting a thorough workout. Definitely sweating the toxins out! I started out with Jari's first DVD Get Ripped (which for a beginner is an excellent option to start with) where I learned the proper form to carry forward through the series. Jari is consistent in reminding you to watch your form and that mind over matter will get you your results.  After a few short weeks with regular ripped workouts (2 - 3 times a week), my body is definitely showing the results.  Thanks Jari!",1153353600,8,782,4.461538461538462
2559838,5,B000FBFUEA,"As someone who is very athletic, I thoroughly enjoy doing this video and see the benefits on my body almost immediately. The segments are simple and easy to follow and they really work your muscles to exhaustion to produce results. My arms and shoulders are now quite defined. Plus, beginners can even do the video by reducing the weights or using no weights at all. I'd recommend this video to anyone who wants to incorporate weights into their routine to transform their body shape.",1151971200,4,484,4.773809523809524
2559839,5,B000FBFUEA,"All of the Get Ripped videos are incredible.  They are unique moves but simple to perform and the cueing is perfect.  I am a personal trainer/physical therapist asst. and I find her videos to be about the best around. I am a trail/mountain and ultra runner, and I use her videos for crosstraining.  They can be adapted to any ability and level.  I have a lot of exercise videos but I always reach for one of the Get Ripped videos.",1151625600,5,430,4.3375
2559840,5,B000FBFUEA,"There are some really detailed descriptions of this workout that accurately breakdown the workout for you.  I'd just like to add that this is a nice change of pace, doing compound exercises, with high reps.  I definitely work up a sweat with this one because of the multi-limb movements. Ripped to the Core has a more aerobic effect than the other dvds Jari offers.

Jari makes her workouts accessible to everyone though.  These compound moves are done safely and at a moderate speed to make sure you keep good form.  Loosing that form could lead to injury and Jari reminds you throughout to check your form.

As in all her workouts, Jari has modifiers who show variations of the exercises.  She wants you to succeed!  I think a beginner would have a nice challenge with any of these workouts and would see improvement (keeping up!) over time.  Intermediates and advanced exercisers will definitely be challenged with easier/harder options that are shown throughout.

Ripped to the Core and Slim and Lean are my two very favorite weight workouts.  Alternating these two workouts with cardio should give you phenomenal results!",1151107200,5,1126,4.9361702127659575
2559841,5,B000FBFUEA,"This is the third Jari Love workout video I've done and its just as good as the first two.  This one really made me sweat.  Jari says you burn alot more calories doing the ""compound"" exercises in this video and I believe it.  You work more than one muscle group at once which is a very efficient way of getting a workout - calorie burn and muscle building at the same time.  Also, this one is alot of fun!

Like in her last video, Jari has people in the background showing options for each exercise - this helps when you can't do everything the more ""advanced"" way or have an injury or problem with a certain joint.  Its all so no-nonsense and easy to do.

These Ripped workouts have helped me lose weight and become more toned.  Thanks to Ripped, I feel stronger and more energetic all the time.",1150502400,4,796,4.295302013422819
2559842,5,B000FBFUEA,"And one that  doesn't require quite as much equipment as most advanced workouts.  A step, a mat, and some sets of light weights will be all you'll need- no stability ball, medicine ball or tubing work here. It's basically broken into ten sections, with each section averaging 5-6 minutes and featuring one compound exercise followed by a brief stretch. Jari generally starts with either an easier version of the exercise or an isolation move, then adds on with a more intense version or added upper body work to make a compound exercise. There is no aerobic warmup; instead the  warmup is the first section of weight work, and gradually builds in intensity.  This starts off with side squats and reverse lunges, and then Jari has you transition into travelling side squats. The second section is ""Spider"" and pushups. The ""Spider"" is basically moving from full plank to forearm plank and repeated, with pushups and stretches in between the planks. The next section is chest work, with chest presses, then chest presses done at the same time that the hips are held in bridge position. The fourth section is bent-leg dead lifts with bicep curls. Section 5 is wide squats with upright rows, and a similar emphasis in section 6 with stiff- leg deadlifts and lat rows.  Section 7 features side squats from the end of a step, with lateral shoulder raise, and a brief set of narrow squats with anterior shoulder raises. Section 8 fries the shoulders further, with overhead presses done in conjunction with step ups onto a step. These aren't tall box climbs, as in the Firm, or high step leg presses as seen in Cathe Friedrich workouts.  The step is at about a 6 inch height. Section 9 works the triceps, first with tricep pushups and then with tricep kickbacks from  all fours position with leg extended to challenge the balance and core. The final section works core and abs with Superman planks (lifting opposing arm and leg while holding plank position), reverse crunches, and regular crunches. Don't expect a lot of ab work- the premise of this workout is that you've been working your entire core throughout the compound work in the previous exercises. The ending stretch is brief, and I added on my own stretches. This workout places a strong emphasis on ""calorie burn"" and ""carb metabolism"". Jari reiterates this throughout the workout, and before each section you'll be shown an overview of the coming exercise, which muscles it works, and the average calorie expenditure. I found this rather distracting, but you may find it motivating. Throughout the sections, there are various modifications shown that are less advanced, such as overhead tricep presses to replace the tricep pushups and kickbacks.  Even with the modifications, I definitely wouldn't recommend this for the beginner or even the low intermediate. You really should be familiar with good form and safety in weight lifting, and also have a good level of ab and back strength to do this. There are a large number of planks in this workout, and if you have wrist problems those may be tough, although Jari mentions that they can be done with hands held in fists. I really like Jari's style- very professional, ""let's get to work"" attitude. The music is OK-better than the original Ripped, but certainly not the  ""driving Body-Pump style music"" that it's been described elsewhere. I have just a few minor quibbles: I felt that biceps and triceps  were a little neglected in favor of shoulders, and even with the high reps, I didn't feel a whole lot in the lower body because of the necessity of using light weights for the compound work. That didn't detract from my opinion of the workout though; this is meant to be muscle definition and toning as opposed to strength work. As Jari constantly repeats ""this won't bulk you up!""",1149292800,56,3792,4.846986089644513
2559843,5,B000FBFUEA,"I have tried all three of the workouts that Jari Love currently has out. ""Ripped to the Core"" is different from the original ""Ripped"" and ""Slim and Lean"" in that it consists of compound exercises. You will work multiple muscle groups at the same time which makes your workout more efficient and is a real calorie burner. Some examples of compound exercises included are: dead lifts and biceps curls, side squats with lateral shoulder raises, and step-ups with overhead shoulder presses. My heart rate was elevated for most of this challenging workout.

The inclusion of compound exercises requires you to engage your core throughout the workout. Additionally, there is a segment of planks, supermans, and traditional ab work. There is also an emphasis on shoulders in ""Ripped to the Core"". Three tracks are dedicated to frying your deltoids to a crisp. I did this workout six hours ago and my shoulders STILL feel the burn.

As in her earlier releases, there are a wide variety of modifications shown so the workout may be done by anyone from beginner to advanced fitness level. It requires minimal equipment (dumbbells and a club step) which is also a plus.

Another great workout by Jari Love! Highly recommended by this fitness enthusiast.",1149033600,91,1242,4.961538461538462
2559844,5,B000FBFUEA,"This is my second Jari Love dvd and I'm glad I bought it (from another online source that has this already).  She is fast becoming a favourite instructor of mine and this workout is very challenging but fun and gives you good results.

You use weights like you were in a gym; high repetitions.  You work multiple muscle groups at a time (this is where the results kick in) and it's easy to follow because before each segment, they demonstrate the techniques you'll need.  Because you are doing squats at the same time as lifting weights, you will need floor space, a step and the weights.  One of the people in the dvd uses a barbell which they say you can use too if you want.  Who needs to go to the gym when you can have this workout at home and get the same results without the drive and other people's sweat etc.  This is great and just as effective as going to a swanky gym.  I love it.",1148947200,9,892,4.205882352941177
2559845,3,B000FBFUEA,This is not a bad DVD. The exercises are effective. I just didn't like the explanation of exercises before you start a set. At the beginning of a sets of exercises there's an explanation of the exercise that almost sounds like a robot and a man demonstrating them. Overall good workout.,1405382400,,286,4.627450980392157

2559851,5,B000FBFUEA,I love Jari Love videos. She is so positive and keeps things moving in her videos so I don't get bored. She brings all the body muscles in and the video allows you to choose all or just certain body circuits which I love. Great video!,1307318400,,234,4.108695652173913
2559852,5,B000FBFUEA,"great stuff!  Appreciate the informative, encouraging approach.  It's a tough work out, let there be no doubt.

I attribute that to weight training with Jari's videos.",1281052800,3,343,4.65
2559853,3,B000FBFUEA,"I am an advanced exerciser and I have a few Jari Love DVDS.  This is not my favorite.  There are several good exercises in this video, but WAY TOO much talking and explaining.  I has to occupy my time doing bicep curls and crunches to keep my heart rate up while Jari and the narrator explained all of the exercises.  Once we got started on the exercises, they were good, but I don't have enough time or patience to listen to all of the explanations.  I will continue to do this workout, but I will be adding in exercises for all of the extended breaks.",1276473600,4,553,4.228571428571429
2559854,5,B000FBFUEA,"Jari is quickly becoming my favorite instructor! I have yet to ever find an instructor that:
a) Works me hard
b) Gives a complete total body workout (no muscles left untouched)
c) Makes a 60+ minute workout FLY BY
d) Not only works my body so that I feel it later, but ALSO allows me the energy to get on with my day even just after finishing her workouts!

I am completely amazed by this woman! I tried Body Rock's Weight/Abs section last week and quickly ordered her 5 Disc Set (this DVD came in it) along with her 2 other newer workouts. I did this DVD this morning and I felt so good, so strong, and so worked, yet relaxed, energized, and excited for my next session with Jari. It's hard to explain! In this DVD you will find that each track is approx 5 minutes long and most feature an upper and lower body compound exercise. If not, then you will have 2 lower body compounds or 2 upper/ab compounds. Examples are the squat/lunge track and the tricep pushups and tricep kickbacks/core balance challenge tracks. She works you thoroughly and all while giving tips and modification options for beginners as well as advanced. She reminds the user to go heavier (unless new) to provide the most challenge, yet to pyramid down in weight if/when your form is compromised. Some other reviews mention the electronic voice description of the next track as being some what ""80s"" but it's not bad. I also enjoy that the first 1 min of each track is used for Jari's decription and weight selection graphs; this allows you to get settled with your equipment and weight ranges. You will need a mat, several dumbbells, and a step with risers is optional- hense the 1 min breaks are nice so you can adjust your step as needed. This is the first time I have done this workout so in the future I will know what is coming. However, those breaks will still be great as I will surely be increasing my weights.

I never thought, ever, that Jari's workouts would be so enjoyable. I have previewed clips of hers over the recent years but never did the workouts. I always assumed the 5 min ""tracks"" would be too long and boring, but I am amazed at how quickly that time flys! I can feel muscles working that I haven't in too long of a time. Injury proned muscles are worked to failure without pain and stress; that has NEVER happened for me. I am not in pain the next day, but I do feel the workout. I can see now why endurance athletes use her workouts and now I can say that I am hooked. I only thought that Cathe Friedrich could provide a hardcore strength workout...not true! I am thankful that I decided to try her DVDs. my body just can't handle the ultra heavy weights anymore; too many injuries that flare up. Jari's work me and will rebuild the atrophied muscle and give me definition without having to be too taxing on my joints. I'm so convinced that her workouts help that I am signing up for Spinning Classes! This one is great bc the aerobic effect is there through most of the workout and especially so if you use the step. It's pure strength but bc it's compound exercises, it get's the heart rate up there. It's like doing 2 workouts in one. This is the first 60+ minute workout that I have done in over 6 months and I felt great afterwards. To know that some ladies use 10s as their ""medium"" weight is inspiring considering some of the reps are well over 70!

I'd buy this again in a heartbeat and look forward to doing it again very soon!

EDIT: 1 day later and my legs (Hamstrings & Glutes), chest, and biceps are feeling this!",1275868800,6,3526,4.378625954198474
2559855,5,B000FBFUEA,I have 3 of Jari's DVDs and this one is my favorite!  She always kicks my but and after baby #1 she got me in my best shape since high school sports.  I have now had baby #2 and I plan on getting a few of her new workouts just to change things up!  LOVE HER!,1273536000,2,258,3.5714285714285716
2559856,4,B000FBFUEA,I originally rented Ripped to the Core through Netflix to see if I would like it. I worked up a nice sweat and I loved it. I have to allow over an hour of available time though-but its well worth it. The soreness the next day (well-during the night) makes my body well aware that this workout is doing its job!,1265932800,3,310,4.098360655737705
2559857,5,B000FBFUEA,"I just did this workout this morning and wanted to share my thoughts on it.

By way of background, I'm a certified personal trainer and I specialize in In-Home and Workplace fitness.  I always enjoy seeing how various other fitness professionals put together workouts, especially those that are meant to be done in someone's home with minimal equipment since that's the environment I work in.  The best trainers I know aren't afraid to learn and assimilate new ideas in any and every way possible and dvds are one of many great resources available to supplement their knowledge or at least trigger some new ideas.

I have reviewed Jari's first ""Ripped"" dvd  previously and I definitely felt this one was far superior in so many ways. Obviously Jari continues to grow and it is clearly reflected in this ""Ripped to the Core"" program.

I liked the fact that she puts together a workout w/ lots of compound and combination movements which use a lot of muscle mass throughout the body and also helps to develop neuromuscular control of complex movements.

Though this is certainly not a beginner workout, she does show lots of modifications and has some of the various ""students"" on the dvd demonstrating different variations of the exercises. Still, in spite of the modifications, there's very little here I would do with a deconditioned client and it would take time for them to physically adapt to these movements in order to perform them safely.

I like the fact that each section is individually chaptered because each segment is pretty intense and requires a certain amount of muscular endurance. By having each segment separate it gives one the opportunity to get a little extra rest between segments, or easily pause the machine to get hydrated or just additional rest without feeling like you would be interrupting the flow of the workout.

Only a few things bother me about this dvd. One is the over emphasis on constantly referring to the calories burned, or the idea that it's burning carbohydrates specifically etc. I feel that an over emphasis on trying to give caloric expenditure is somewhat misleading. What I mean is that if one's goal is fat loss then diet is going to play the biggest part of that process. No matter how many calories you expend during a workout, if you're diet isn't supporting the exercise then you won't see much in terms of physical results.

To put it another way, if you eat cleanly then exercise will help you get fit and tone, but if you exercise properly but eat poorly, you will get more fit but you can still have a lot of body fat no matter how many calories you burn during exercise. To burn 500 calories takes a monumental physical effort, to eat 500 calories takes about 2 seconds of poor food choices.

The other thing that bothers me is the unsupported bent over rows. To me (and also exercise physiologist Douglas Brooks),  the risk isn't worth the reward for this type of exercise and I think it's setting a lot of people up for injury. Even though Jari does constantly remind people to modify if at risk, I think it's a poor choice to place these types of exercises in home dvds where folks don't have someone to monitor their form.  Most folks can't tell if what they are doing is safe, they'd be better off with a supported one arm row.

From a practical standpoint, I think for many people the length of the program can be problematic, since it's about an hour or so long.  It would be more practical to take a workout like this and divide it up into two 30 minute workouts, each with a warm-up and cool-down, but that's just my opinion on how it might better serve more folks, it isn't something that is an indisputable negative.

Lastly, I do like Jari as a dvd instructor, she is very business like and not a perky annoying instructor. You never feel like she is speaking down to her audience which I think is a positive. Some folks may find her a little dull, but I'd take a little dull over someone who is too perky.  Personally I like folks like Tony Horton who have a sense of humor and still inspire one to work hard, but Jari does a perfectly good job in her programs, is very likeable and sincere, and has good presence.",1263772800,9,4186,4.597315436241611
2559858,1,B000FBFUEA,"This video wastes your time by discussing how many calories an exercise burns.  Instead it should be discussing proper form to prevent injury and get the most out of an exercise.  They show too much of her face and not where the weights are.  For instance, the weights are in her hands and going down her body but instead they are showing her face.  I am thinking--okay so where are the weight to go? are the weights to be shoulder width apart? are the weights outside our knees? on top of the thighs? I have no idea as they are showing her face and not the weights and she does not say anything about proper form.
Jeri looks like she is ready to film a movie not a workout--long straightened hair and way too much makeup. She should pull the hair back and not be afraid to be real. She looks stiff performing exercises as she is trying not to sweat or ruin her hair.
Jeri also looks anorexic rather than fit which is distracting. I would rather the focus be on proper form than calories.  Working out is to get fit and strong and prevent injury with proper form.  Not how many calories you are burning.
I am looking for a workout similar to Body Pump which I have found with good teachers stress proper form and stress to prevent injury.  Body Pump also has exercises which are not too difficult so proper form is easy.
Please let me know if there is anything like this on the market. A Body Pump teacher let me look at their DVD which instructors get--those DVDs are excellent.  Unfortunately they are not for sale to non license people.  The instructors in these videos look healthy--not anorexic.",1261008000,,1600,4.414965986394558
2559859,5,B000FBFUEA,"I wanted to find a DVD that would give me a good workout without having too many different pieces of equipment - all I use for this workout is a set of dumbbells.  I have this and ""Get Ripped"" and I really enjoy the workouts.  Jari's voice is soothing, which I like, and she is very supportive while she talks you through the workout.  The people in the workout are all doing the exercises at different ability levels and you are told to modify the workout to your own abilities and comfort level.  I especially like that she counts the reps out loud so you don't have to look at the TV to make sure you're keeping up!  I used Cathe something-or-other's video and hated it and sold it.  I'm keeping these!",1258761600,,705,4.303030303030303
2559860,2,B000FBFUEA,"I purchased this DVD after reading many positive reviews on Amazon and Collage Exercise Video site.  I exercised with this tape three times and each time was with dread.  First, I love compound exercise and know this to be a very effective way to exercise.  I also prefer to work my whole body vs specific body parts during each session.  This DVD offers both.

Unfortunately, what I did not like about the DVD is the instructors low energy.  I exercise before work and I need high energy, bright lights and the instructor to be more of a coach and that is not the case with this DVD.  As other have stated, she is very monotone and the set is very drab.  I like the teaching style of Cathe, Kari Anderson and Leslie Sansone, and on a really high energy day, I can even take Billy Blanks.  With so many great home exercise DVD's out there to choose from (Cathe MuscleMax, or any Cathe DVD), I'd recommend skipping this one.

It would be very helpful if longer clips of the DVD were available.  I did look at the clips on Collage but it is only 30 seconds long.  Cathe clips on her site are a good 5 minutes or longer.

Though they are all somewhat similar, they are different enough to provide my body with a new challenge. I do one for a month or so, then switch. I'm stronger than I've ever been. For you women who are looking for a workout that will lift your butt off of the backs of your legs, this will do it in short order. (Mine was sinking pretty low after about year 38.) Also, I suffer from exercise induced migraines, but these workouts don't trigger them. The workouts are extremely effective, but they don't have you jumping around the living room. They provide an excellent way to get in shape and stay that way, without the danger of overheating. I can't recommend these workouts enough. Jari is wonderful.",1252627200,3,810,4.593103448275862

2559863,4,B000FBFUEA,"I'm a long-time gym bunny and I have been lifting heavy for a while. When I couldn't afford my gym membership and had a schedule change, I thought I'd try a home-training DVD.Usually a variation from Oxygen or M & F Hers has sufficed.

I was dubious about Jari, since fairly or not, her overly blonde and skeletal look put me off. But I did find this video to be a challenge the first couple of times and even now it gives me a pretty good, intense workout a la Body Pump. Going back to lighter weights at first felt odd but the way she has the workout structured, you are definitely being challenged. Her background exercisers are very good and appealing. I wish it wasn't so dang long.. I've taken to doing a quick warm-up of my own and stopping after the tricep extension track to cool down, giving me a 45 minute routine.

I didn't have a problem with her coaching: it's laid-back yet motivating, and as a fellow fitness instructor I enjoyed hearing her call out body parts and exercises correctly ( adduction, etc). She does mis-cue/miscount a few times and it is irritating, however if you do the workout enough you will not be caught off-guard. I wish she wouldn't keep talking about ""not bulking up"".. I get it, this workout is about definition and tone, but the idea that women can ""bulk up"" from weight training has been debunked repeatedly and it is offensive to keep implying it. The music is just fine, if not amazing,I've heard far worse. No-nonsense really does describe this DVD well.

Anyway, I'm not sure I will stick with purely this system,but I am enjoying it. I am curious about her ""Extremely Ripped"" routine and will probably rotate this with a lift heavy routine soon. If you can't get to a gym and you love the Body Pump format, you will get a lot out of this release.",1248739200,2,1794,4.463414634146342

The Slim & Lean is not at all the same workout as Ripped to the Core like another reviewer is suggesting. Slim & Lean is like the original Ripped just the advanced version, very intense working one muscle group at a time. Ripped to the Core is mostly compound exercises (multiple muscles and exercises at the same time). It also contains exercises that really kick up your heart rate. It's an excellent total body workout that burns tons of calories and exhausts your muscles in about an hour.

You move from one area of the body to another with complete ease. Very easy to follow, and just burns them muscles like nobody's business!

2559877,5,B000FBFUEA,"As I said in my Slim and Lean review, I like Jari's routines but they're just too long for me. I think I like this better than Slim and Lean because this has the compound exercises and in my opinion, I'd be burning more calories. I use 3-8 lb dumbbells depending on which muscle group I'm working on. I may have this for a while now but I still do the spider push-ups on my knees 'coz I prefer to finish the track than give up right in the middle of that track just because it's too hard. I use the step for the shoulder track but I only have 3 lb dumbbells on that one. Honestly, I picked the amount of poundage that's light at first and if after 1 minute, it's just too easy, then I switch to a heavier set. Jari even mentions that if you're not feeling it, overload on those muscles 'coz that will give results. However, she also reminds you that if it's too painful, go lighter....so listen to your body to avoid injuries. Bottomline, this is a great DVD. It's nice to have this in your collection because every now and then you'll have that extra hour in the morning. Oh....at the beginning of each track, it tells you how much weight each participant will be having so that can also be your guide... but remind yourself that if your new to Jari, these people in the video are fitness instructors; they do this for a living....so again, get familiar with it first and listen to your body...GOODLUCK!

2559879,5,B000FBFUEA,"There's NO WAY you aren't going to get a fantastic workout doing this routine.  It will whip your sorry behind into shape in no time, trust me!  It is currently my favorite workout video. The ""holy grail"" if you will.

I was feeling ugly & depressed last year because of how bad i looked & i felt crappy too.  I was always naturally slim but years of a desk job & not eating right caught up with me.  I had just turned 31 & I never had any energy, i panted going up only 1 flight of stairs, and even though i was technically still kind of skinny i was flabby & gross.  My once pretty legs looked like scrawny little chicken legs.  I had grown a pot belly,  i had a pathetic withered looking bird chest,  and sloppy jiggly flabby arms. ugh. thinking about it makes me shudder....NOW i have so much more strength. I don't ever pant going up or down stairs, I feel healthy & strong, and my sexy legs are back! Sure there's more meat on my bones but it's muscle and man it looks good!  the flab on my arms is gone, i don't have any back-fat when i put a bra on, and my chest looks normal again. I am small chested so it'll never be huge but at least what is there is shaped nicely now. Oh, and my waist size went back down.  I fit in clothes that i was too flabby in the gut for last year.  I love my body now.

Here's how i got started with my transformation from pot-bellied bird-chested weakling to sexy-legged muscle-butted ripped powerhouse......Disgusted with myself & not getting good enough results after months of just cardio videos & walking outside, i realized i had to try something else.  I only wanted to tone up & lose a little bit of flab. So naturally cardio seemed the way to go.  I was SO wrong about that. I toned up slightly but that's about it.  I needed something new but I was always scared of anything with weights, i thought i'd end up looking like a dude.  But i did a LOT of research online.  I came across the Jari Love 3 pack & reviews were nothing but good. Everyone seemed thrilled & they all raved about her videos & said they are the best.  So i took a chance & ordered it off amazon.  This was about 6 months ago.  The day i got the videos i was excited but prepared for being disappointed as i always seemed to be.  But i tore open the package & Right away i tried Slim & lean.  It was tough, but I liked it so much i stuck with it.  Even though it was hard for me to complete i could tell i was getting an amazing workout.  I was huffing & puffing & my heart rate was definitely up. i was hooked.  I also tried the other two videos, ""get ripped to the core"" & ""get ripped"".  But ""get ripped to the core"" was too hard, i couldn't get a feel for it.  I felt off balance & just wasn't in good enough shape to complete all the moves.  I wasn't in good enough shape yet. Plus i have a BOSU, not a regular step. It is  really really challenging doing compound exersizes off the bosu. And ""get ripped"" seemed easier.  Since i wanted tough but not impossible, i stuck with ""slim & lean"". For a few months i did just that video to build my strength up.  well a few months of that video prepared me for being better able to handle the routine in this video.  It was still very challenging but i was able to make it through all the way. (barely!)  I've been using it for about 2 months now & i can easily make it through now & the results are showing.

Now i rotate ""get ripped to the core"" with ""slim & lean"". I prefer twice a week to 3 times, if i do 3 times a week it seems like my muscles get too fatigued. I think doing the compound exercizes in this video off of the bosu is burning tons of calories. because i am really shedding that last little layer of fat i could never seem to get off my belly.  My abs are starting to poke through the flab.  yay!

I can't stress enough how much Jari's videos have transformed my body.  I'm so well toned now i can't even believe it.  The protein shakes i started drinking combined with doing Jari's videos twice a week is really doing the trick.  Like Jari states in her videos, you don't get bulky.  You just get really cut & lean.  Her videos are beyond awesome.  I just ordered the new ""chiseled"" video & an older one ""ripped 1000"". Can't wait to try those out. I'll review them after i do.  :)  :) :)",1200873600,25,4272,4.074429771908764

I think her workouts are the reason behind the recent definition in my shoulders. I  don't have time to go to the gym and wait on machines or ""meatheads"" hogging the weight benches.

2559890,4,B000FBFUEA,"I'm an intermediate-to-advanced exerciser who recently discovered Jari Love's workouts.  Her first workout, Get Ripped, became an immediate favorite, as it's a perfect match for my level, Ripped to the Core is the second of Jari's workouts that I have tried.  As is usual for her, Jari does not do a traditional warm-up; rather, she starts right in with the weight moves. I find that it takes me a bit of trial and error to figure out the right weights to use in Jari's workouts.  Here, because the compound moves required more exertion, I found that I needed to go lighter than I did in Get Ripped, never using heavier than 8# dumbbells and often reaching for my 5# and even 3# ones (oddly enough, Jari states that you can actually go HEAVIER for compound moves because you are recruiting more muscles, but I did NOT find this to be the case for me).  The great thing about all of the Ripped workouts is that Jari and her three background exercisers vary not only in the equipment they use--eg, Jari generally uses dumbbells here, with one background exerciser always using the barbell and others sometimes using just weight plates--but also in their individual weight loads, which are very helpfully shown on screen at the start of every new exercise.

As in the original Get Ripped, Jari varies the count of each exercise, using different temps such as 4-4, 3-1, 2-2, etc.  But Ripped to the Core also adds compound moves:  either you'll do a superset with an upper/lower body combination or you'll move both areas at the same time.  Similar to Get Ripped, you will do a high number of repetitions for each body part, and you may need to go lower on your weights as mentioned above.  The workout begins with a side squat/reverse lunge combo.  Then it is down to the floor for a really tough move, the spider--this is a planking exercise where you go from a full plank, down to your elbows, then back up again, and it is super challenging!  Jari makes it all the more difficult by doing push-ups inbetween spider sets (the male background exerciser continues the push-ups even during the stretch breaks--ouch!).  I am always VERY glad when this section is over.  You stay on the floor for a chest press combined with a pelvic raise (Jari and crew lie on their steps), then it's back to standing for a deadlift/bicep curl combo.  Next comes a wide squat with an upright row, although there is a modification shown if you have shoulder issues.  Sticking with the tough work for legs/shoulders, you'll do a side squat off the step (can be modified on the floor) adding a delt raise and also a knee lift.  Following this, there is a VERY brief narrow squat set with front raises, again adding knee lifts (I believe only 8 total reps here).  The next series is MUCH more challenging than it looks.  You start with a simple slow step climb, then add a shoulder press and do LOTS of reps.  When I did this with my 5# dumbbells, I was dying by the end, so now I'm sticking with the 3#.  Then it's back down to the floor on all fours for tricep kickbacks, adding a leg raise and then the leg in and out to work the core more.  Abs work follows, and I really didn't like the how this section starts off.  First of all, Jari uses the male background exerciser to display the most advanced modification, even though a message on screen says that most people should NOT attempt this exercise!  Although the other two background exercisers show easier versions, the camera never focuses on them, so this segment is very hard to follow.  Two exercises are performed, a plank with side leg lift and a superman, and I just sort of do my own thing for both of these.  Then Jari moves on to more traditional abs work, which I liked much better, although it was pretty brief: she does a set moving each leg in and out and then a few sets of pulsing crunches.  The workout, which comes right in at an hour, ends with a cool-down, first on the floor to stretch the hamstrings/hips and then moving to seated for upper body, finishing with some neck stretches.

Extras on this DVD include exercise demonstrations, interviews, and bloopers.  I wasn't crazy about the music--it generally had a pumping, techno-type beat (with occasional vocals) similar to what you would hear in a club--but I found it to be less glaring/more tolerable than in the original Get Ripped.  Jari herself comes across as a bit cool and reserved, and although some people might not click with her, I actually liked her no-nonsense style as well as her excellent form pointers and good cuing.  She does try to be encouraging, frequently saying ""fantastic!"" (a change from ""awesome!"" in the original).  I would say that this workout is most suited for high intermediate-to-advanced exercisers.  It is probably doable for advanced beginners/low intermediates using VERY light weights, but I definitely would not recommend it for complete beginners, as I think that some of the exercises (such as the spider move) would be way too difficult, even in a modified form.  Personally, I found the compound moves in this workout (ie, moving the upper body and the lower body at the same time) to be fairly strenuous, making this workout more tiring for me than the original Get Ripped.  In addition, some of the individual exercises are quite tough, which gives this workout a slight dread factor for me, at least in the very beginning during the tough spider series.  Overall, however, I liked that this workout provided me with a challenge, and I would definitely recommend it for experienced exercisers, especially those who enjoy compound moves.",1181779200,16,5592,4.671428571428572

But I've only completed the workout 3 times and was trying to perfect my form, so I will up my weight next time I do the workout.  This is my first Jari workout.

Slim & Lean is more ""body pump"" style, basic major muscle group workout with lighter weights and more reps.  Ripped to the Core has some similar moves, but they go a step further to create a compound exercise.  For instance, a basic plie squat is coupled with an upright row, and bent leg dead lifts are coupled with bicep curls.  The movements really create a cardiovascular effect because you are using your lower body and upper body at the same time.

This DVD will certainly push all exercisers (there are modifiers for all level), and it provides the number of calories you are actually working off, as well as the suggested weight loads for all exercisers.  Note, however, that it is challenging. You do a substantial amount of repetitions for each exercise, increasing your heartrate and strength.  You will need a step and dumbbells.  I encourage you to go with a lesser weight than you might have been using with other exercise videos given the number of repetitions.

2559903,3,B000FBFUEA,"The exercises are very good.  Long sets and very challenging.  My only problem is that I bought this ""Get Ripped to the Core"" and the other one ""Slim and Lean"".  They are both the exact same video, nothing different.  It is very misleading and truthfully, a rip off.  You think you are buying two different videos and they are the same, exact different packaging and different name.",1157932800,17,382,4.641791044776119
2559904,4,B000FBFUEA,"I really like Jari Love and really enjoyed her Ripped workout, so when I heard she was releasing new workouts I had to pounce on them.  Ripped was very enjoyable, thorough and fun, but not too hard.  Jari has upped the difficulty a few notches with this workout.  I realized how weak I was with endurance training after doing this workout and Slim & Lean.  I have some work to do where that is concerned.  Jari is joined by Laurie, Ben & Christy.  All you need for this workout are dumbells, and a step, a barbell can be used also.

The workout itself consists of 10 tracks plus a stretch, each exercise performed to a different song, lasting about 5 minutes which for some feels like an eternity.  Jari talks a lot about burning calories and carbohydrates throughout the workout, some people might be annoyed by this but it didn't really bother me.  For each exercise there is a demonstration of what is coming so you can prepare, I liked this plus it was an opportunity to take a breather and grab some water.  It also displays the amount of weight that each exerciser uses, which I found very helpful in determining how much weight that I needed to use.  I used a range of 3-10 pound dumbells which was pretty tough for me.

Each muscle group hit and well, the shoulders are especially worked as they are included in three of the tracks.  Here is a listing of the exercises.

side squats/reverse lunges
spider/pushups
chest press with hips raised
bent leg deadlifts/biceps curls
wide (plie squats/upright rows
stiff leg deadlifts/double arm lat rows
squats/side lateral raises & narrow squats/front raises
step ups/overhead press
triceps kickbacks with core work
abs
stretch

Christy does a lot of beginner modifications for these exercises, which I found helpful, whether it was foregoing the step or not using dumbells.  After being used to lifting heavier weights and using low reps while using The Firm workouts and others, I really had to lighten up on the weights for this one.  I have heard that  people are seeing great results with this one, while incorporating this type of training in with my heavier weight work, I truly believe that I will too.

Overall I give this workout 4 stars. Jari Love is a great instructor, one of my new favorites.",1157846400,20,2256,4.680203045685279

8120373,1,B000FBFUEA,"By far the most boring workout I have ever done-not only are the excercises standard squats and bicep curls etc,the whole layout of the DVD and wasted time in between on stretches and explanations made this drag on forever. If it wasn't for my own pumped up music,I would have given up 10 minutes in. And although it says Core in the title,my core did not feel worked at all-this made it to that pile in my DVD cabinet of old and long forgotten workouts that I suffered through once and felt so unmotivated to see ever again",1515974400,,524,4.357142857142857

Yes, there's a bit too much talking, but for awhile I was glad because I needed that 30 seconds or so to recover :)",1406160000,3,366,4.097222222222222
