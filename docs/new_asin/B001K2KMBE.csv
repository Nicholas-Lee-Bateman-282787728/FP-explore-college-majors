3662957,1,B001K2KMBE,"Whomever is guilty of producing this piece of ""insert your own profane explative"" is ignorant of, and oblivious to, history, let alone reality.  I teach management and leadership, George Washington was great at both of them, due principally to his outstanding character.  To show this travisty to young people (or uneducated people) would be a crime!! If I could give 5 negative stars, I would.",1253577600,26,394,5.046153846153846
3662958,1,B001K2KMBE,"Although every facet of his life was described in such as way as to portray him as an ambitious, power-hungry mercenary who married for money, it was still interesting to see what Nat Geo's tack on the subject was until the narrator asserted that GW was, untrue to his reputation for honesty, ""willing to blur ethical lines.""

Why? Because GW used disinformation during the war to trick the British!

This ""revelation"" was so stupid that I stopped watching it right there. I hope we do not find ourselves fighting for our existence alongside these twerps who will be constantly harping on how ""if we trick the enemy or lie to them maybe we don't deserve to win.""

Idiots.",1242691200,39,671,4.669491525423729
3662959,1,B001K2KMBE,"I was stunned by the extent to which National Geographic struggled to diminish the history of George Washington.

Nothing was left unattacked. Washington was a medicore leader at best. Washington only married Martha as a way to improve himself socially, and only after a failed attempt to move in on a married woman. (This based on a letter that was attributed to Washington, found and printed 100 years after it was alleged to be written, and never verified as coming from him by any scientific testing.) Of course, he really loved slavery and only freed the slaves after his and his wife's death because he was concerned about his legacy. Even his false teeth were proof that he abused slaves.

Naturally, his integrity and honesty was challenged as well. Their proof for this? Because he used disinformation as he was prosecuting the Revolutionary War. Almost every military commander will do this, but for Washington, it was proof he wasn't an honest person.

This DVD is so beneath National Geographic. I expect quality historical coverage from them. I don't expect a lilly-white propoganda speel about Washington from them, but this . . . this is nothing short of yellow journalism, intended to tear down one of our most important founding fathers.

Did Michael Moore produce this?",1241481600,60,1287,4.972093023255814
8314128,4,B001K2KMBE,"Very good video, I wish it was longer but a very interesting documentary.  The only slight disagreement I have is that In some books I've read about Washington regarding ""Ona Judge"", it was actually President Washington's wife Martha Custis that was extremely upset about her slave running away.  Washington had separate slaves from his wife and it was she that wanted Ona back.  What a fascinating story, I was glad that Ona was able to start her own life.  Thank you.",1406505600,2,469,4.753086419753086
8314129,1,B001K2KMBE,"I have never left a review remotely like this before. This is easily the worst, half baked, and negatively slighted documentary in general, and documentary of the great G. W. I have ever come across. I would have given it no stars but then I could not have left a review. How bad is it? I gave it to my 2 dogs to chew up. It stunk so bad, even they would not touch it. Nuff said.",1380067200,5,379,3.935064935064935
8314130,1,B001K2KMBE,"wow, this was unfortunate for a fan of George Washington.  Very negative and biased.  If you enjoy  negative interpretations of American heroes, you may like it. But many of the conclusions they reach in this are in direct conflict with Washingtons own words; (and other historians ) which means interpreting many of his statements as lies. I'd need proof before stating something like that but such a thing didn't prevent the filmakers from displaying their projected thoughts or intentions as truths!  gotta love it.",1373414400,,518,5.130952380952381
8314131,5,B001K2KMBE,It is about time that a truthful account of GW's life is told.  It does nothing to diminish his contributions but explodes some of the myths that give citizens a false sense of the man.  He was a man - not a saint - not a God.,1361059200,3,226,3.7872340425531914
8314132,1,B001K2KMBE,This is absolute garbage and it makes me sad someone would makeup such lies and distort facts in this manner about one of the greatest Americans that ever lived.,1291507200,2,161,4.586206896551724
8314133,3,B001K2KMBE,"I have never seen such a polarized set of reviews: just fives and ones! North and South! I am English-born and US-naturalized, so maybe I am objective enough to come in at the equator.

I have to say this is not one of National Geographic's best efforts.  As I watched more and more facts roll in about George Washington, I noticed two things: most of the facts were not really new, and the facts they presented did not really support the negative spin they put on them.

  * his loves:  in youth he was infatuated with a beautiful married woman (who hasn't been?) but when she kissed him off, he married another young, beautiful, and wealthy woman (who wouldn't?)

  * his honesty:  I don't know where that cherry-tree story came from, but I know no one of intelligence takes it very seriously; so there is no reason to suppose his use of military intelligence during the revolution reflects on his honesty, as the film suggested. (Any leader in those days  -  or any other  -  who didn't use spies would be considered simply negligent of his cause;  incidentally, the film makes no mention of the hanging of Major Andre, the English spy, from an oak tree, still to be seen on the village green in Tappan, NY.)

  * his teeth:  I have seen most of George's dentures on display at the Museum of Dentistry in Baltimore; they are neither wood nor human teeth, but some sort of early ceramic; the film suggests that Washington cruelly extracted a slave's tooth to fill his inventory, but with three hundred-odd slaves at Mt Vernon, many must have had teeth extracted for the same humane reason that Gerorge's were removed.  (Even today, extracted human teeth are a dime a dozen, almost literally; ask your local tooth fairy).

  * his battles:  he lost most of them.  Most generals do, and Washington was hopelessly outgunned, not only in numbers of able men but in supply too; even across three thousand miles of ocean, the English government could support far more forces than Washington could sustain by relying on local supply. He won the only important battle:  the last one.  A miracle of military leadership.

The upsides of the National Geographic film include the wonderful presentation of recent efforts to reconstruct his youthful appearance by computer animation, and the final admonition to see George as a real human being, and not just the face on the dollar bill.  But most of all, the rehearsal of his life has provoked much polarization on this site, and most of it seems to be unnecessary;  just the thing George would have known how to prevent:  he was one of the greatest mediators known to history.",1290816000,6,2617,4.685714285714286
8314134,5,B001K2KMBE,"Americans hate to be told the truth about their past almost as much as they love to worship their heroes. George Washington is no exception. But how can we love our country if we refuse to educate ourselves as to its REAL truths--not the romantic myths created by propaganda? This film is difficult to see, but it is an accurate portrait of Washington and is indicative of many of our lionized ""founding fathers."" Most were scum bags, people who kept slaves and denied the vote to women and the poor. Most made their fortunes through dubious means and few were willing to confront grating problems of morality. Washington made his fortune through marriage and used his slaves as any plantation owner would. I'm sorry this upsets many critics, but we are not children. There is no tooth fairy, no Santa, and our leaders were mostly liars and opportunists. Sorry.",1274832000,4,861,4.785234899328859
8314135,1,B001K2KMBE,"I was as horrified as the other reviewers when I watched this DVD -- which thankfully I did not purchase, I borrowed it from the library and I'm going to ask them to add a disclaimer.

Not surprisingly this presentation skips right over George Washington's role in the Constitutional Convention and his term as President. The clear goal is to undermine not only this great man's memory but the confidence of our citizens in our own nation. Not to teach, but to erase from our common knowledge the incredible human achievement that is the United States Constitution.

If you have the misfortune to watch this video and find yourself asking -- hey, wasn't he also President? I recommend an excellent book: Miracle at Philadelphia by Catherine Drinker Brown.

 It's time for everyone to think twice about what we learn from ""respected"" sources like National Geographic. This video is flat out trash.",1274400000,11,896,4.913907284768212
8314136,1,B001K2KMBE,"This is the worst documentary I have ever seen in my life. How anyone could make a mess out of one of the most interesting characters in human history is beyond me. I am not an expert on Washington, but I do know enough about his life to know that there are a lot of unsubstantiated claims in this vapid, flavorless waste of time. If you have read this far, keep reading, and please keep searching for the ""REAL"" Real George Washington, because he is out there, in his own writings, and in some very good books, written by people who have a better understanding of human nature, and human history. I do know that as a man, Washington was highly regarded by everyone who knew him, his friends, his enemies, his army, native americans, and most importantly his slaves. This was a person touched by God, who brought about the founding of the greatest free nation in the history of the world, the first nation where slavery did come to an end, as many of its founders hoped for, including Washington. The makers of this film need to go back to ""Real"" school. And the National Geographic Society needs to remake this piece of garbage.",1273363200,10,1129,4.485436893203883
8314137,1,B001K2KMBE,"I have come to expect this sort of stuff from some historians...I could not believe that Nat Geo would actually participate in such a method deviation and fact manipulation. The ""real"" George Washington, yea right. I no longer feel safe watching history! Every time, I'm like how much are they twisting and fabricating? Soon I will not be sure if everything I know of history is actual or full of....lies. Having discovered several other Nat Geo's accounts to be similar....they seem to be DOUBTABLE, and in the back of my mind, I'm like it's probably full of... Why would they do that to us?
