2733871,3,B000MGBLGE,"Unless you have some kind of dance background, this workout is a little tough.  Jamie shows you each routine at a slow pace, but steps it up a notch too quick.  It takes me a while to catch on and this went way too fast for me.",1182902400,4,227,3.8085106382978724
2733872,4,B000MGBLGE,"this dvd is a great work out for beginners and pretty good dancers.  after pregnancy, i have not gone to the gym.  succumbing to work out videos to get some sort of exercise, i picked up this dvd because i missed hip hop dance class.  the moves are not too hard to get, but not so easy that i don't want to do the dvd again.  just doing it 4 times earns your money back since dance classes are usually 10 dollars per hour or so.  the only thing i did not like is at the end of the dvd jamie breaks down two of the 8 counts he thinks were ""hard"" but he actually chooses the easier 8 counts to break down. rock your body! rock your body!",1182816000,3,635,3.891472868217054
2733873,4,B000MGBLGE,"Finally a Jamie King dance workout I don't have to try and follow along on the Nike website! I liked this workout a lot, and I usually find most cardio hip-hop DVDs lame. It's ""organised"" like a dance class, with phrases learned at half-time then tempo, a dress rehearsal where you put it all together and then a performance where you run the whole thing through a few times. The choreography is cool, and once you know it you can put a lot more energy into it and have a fun workout. Sometimes they counted off the beat, but it's easy to ignore that if you can count. This isn't high-intensity like a Les Mills dance class, but for a day where you want a steady-state burn, this is a fun workout to try. I hope there'll be more of these down the line, maybe getting progressively harder.",1181260800,18,788,4.331081081081081
2733874,5,B000MGBLGE,"Another review broke down the sections of the DVD very well, so I won't dwell on that.

The workout is hard at first, you will stumble through the moves, and you won't be able to keep up.  This is a good thing!  It makes the workout more of a challenge and something that I will keep coming back to.  Just don't feel down or frustrated if you don't get it at first.

You can tell Jamie's background is dance and not aerobics or fitness, but that's not a bad thing either.  It is really helpful if you know how to pickup on the 8 counts.

There is also a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rock-Your-Body/dp/1594865663/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rock Your Body</a>&nbsp;book available that has the same routine that's on the DVD in picutres.  This was really helpful the first few times.  The book has lots of other great info too, and I would suggest you pick it up",1180915200,22,905,4.940397350993377
2733875,5,B000MGBLGE,"I bought this DVD after reading that it was Shape magazine's DVD of the month, and I just finished my second time doing it.  Overall, it's a great workout that is a lot of fun!

Jamie King leads the workout, and he is accompanied by four back-up dancers.  Jaime has a lot of energy, and makes the workout fly by, which is always nice. The workout is broken down into six main sections:  a warm-up, rehearsal 1, rehearsal 2, dress rehearsal (where you put the two sections together slowly), the performance (where you put the two sections together more quickly in front of an ""audience""), and a cool down.

In each of the two rehearsal sections, Jamie breaks down the choreography and makes it very esay to follow.  If you can't get a move, though, a great feature of the DVD is that in several places you can click on a sub-menu and go to the bonus section where Jamie breaks down the move even more slowly.

One of the things that makes this workout so unique is that the workout is done on a stage with a DJ playing music.  During the dress rehearsal and performance sections, the dancers and Jamie also change into ""costumes"" and even do the routine in front of a live audience.  It really feels like you're a rock star while doing these sections of the workout!

The DVD also has a bonus strength section and a section where Jamie breaks down the moves in more detail.  The first time I did this workout, I couldn't quite keep up with the nuances of the moves, but I can see progress and I can also see that I won't be bored with this DVD in the future.

The last thing I wanted to say is that I was pleasantly surprised about how this workout got my heart rate up.  It's true that there are much harder cardio dance workouts out there, but I was definitely breaking a sweat -- and having fun while doing it!  Overall, it's a fun, very unique workout!",1179792000,86,1855,4.323699421965318
2733886,2,B000MGBLGE,I consider myself well coordinated and I'm a pretty good dancer but I could not keep up.  Buy this if you have previous dance training and can transition from move to move quickly.  Do not buy this if you are a beginner in dance.  I could not get a good workout with this because I could never get the moves down quite right.,1371081600,,325,4.126984126984127
2733887,5,B000MGBLGE,"I really like this dvd. and what a workout! Hey I am 44 I Praise Dance - I don't do Hip Hop- But I use several different forms and styles to make my own moves,Ballet,Jazz,Ball Room,ect. I already had the book so I wanted the dvd. Great choice and it being a workout makes it even better. It really does work your whole body. Great Buy!",1362700800,,335,4.090909090909091
2733888,5,B000MGBLGE,"I just found this on my shelf!  I can't believe I haven't done this until tonight.  WOW!  This is a great hip hop routine that Jamie breaks down in half-time a few times and then does each segment full tempo.  Then he adds on each move at half tempo, to full tempo and then ""connects the dots"" as he puts it, adding each segment together til you get the full dance.  It's a great workout and if you like hip hop, this one's for you.  I'm 66 and if I can do it, so can you!",1361923200,,472,3.8645833333333335
2733889,5,B000MGBLGE,"I work out seven days a week doing a variety of workouts but dance videos are my favorites.  I do find though that after I master a dvd that sometimes I get bored quickly, so I tend to like ones that are challenging that I might not perfect after a couple tries.  This one fit the bill.  I have done it about 3 times now and I still have to work on the moves to do them as quickly as he does, and it will be quite a while until I feel like I have any kind of polish to the moves.  For me, this is fun and I like to be challenged.  Now, saying that, I would say this is not for everyone.  If you have had some dance training that is helpful.  None of the moves are overly complex, but the challenge comes in doing them up to tempo, which is fast.  I often have the moves when they are done slowly, but once they speed up I get that deer in the headlight look, so it takes a lot of concentration in order to do the moves at the quick pace, and as a teen I did take dance so I am used to doing a routine and learning quickly.

There is a section that helps you with two of the more complex moves, but it is still a short intro.

I would say if you don't like minimal instruction and feel like you have two left feet, this one won't be for you-too frustrating and may take longer than you would like to learn the moves.  If you love dance, have some background, natural talent or are super patient, then give it a go.  Jamie is fun, upbeat and cues well.

Overall, I really like this one, but it will be a while before I can do all the moves fast and look good doing them, but that is all in the fun of it.",1320624000,,1602,3.8328267477203646
2733890,2,B000MGBLGE,"I wanted to like this. I really did, but I should have listened to the others reviewers. It ups the difficulty level like a bullet train. Hard to enjoy when you feel like you have 2 left feet the whole time (and I'm a pretty good dancer). Yes, I know that if I just keep practicing, I'll eventually catch up but every time I think of popping the dvd in, I groan and put in my ""Total Workout in Ten!"" with Amy Dixon (she is such a great instructor, unlike Jamie King). Jamie has the enthusiasm but lacks the ability to really break it down more slowly and in smaller chunks for us ""regular"" people. I love to dance and dancing is a fun way to get your exercise but save yourself some money and frustration and skip this one.",1314144000,4,723,4.171428571428572
2733891,4,B000MGBLGE,"I danced for 14 years, but had given it up after high school, so I was super ""rusty"".  I love dancing, but I got way out of shape during my college and post-college years.  I wanted a workout that would help me get back in shape while also distracting me from the fact that I was exercising (which I hate!) and this DVD definitely does that!  I seriously sweat doing this workout and my muscles are always sore the next day.  Some of the other reviews said this was too hard for non dancers and moves too fast, but I'd recommend not necessarily planning on doing the whole DVD start to finish- at least not at first.  I always do the warm-up and cool-down, but usually just pick a series of moves and repeat those sections until I have it- more like you would in an actual dance class.  I've still gotten a ton of exercise doing it this way and sometimes I end up working out for way longer than the actual DVD run-time because I'm backing it up and doing it again.  The time just flies by!  Sometimes it even helps to put it on slow motion (most DVD remotes have a fast/slow button, after all!) if you're having trouble picking up the moves.  Who says you have to do it without stopping or backing up?! It's your workout- do it however you want.  I think its totally worth the money for what you get- a fun, challenging workout that makes you want to come back and do it again.",1284595200,,1378,4.2251908396946565
2733892,5,B000MGBLGE,"Loved this DVD!  I own over 50 workout DVD's and am always looking for something new and exciting to workout to.  Being a former dance studio owner I like to have something a little more challenging so I don't get tired of the choreography too quickly.  This had fun steps and Jamie kept the pace as he was teaching the steps.  Too many dance workouts start and stop, start and stop and you lose the quick pace.  The music used was also fun and upbeat.  An added bonus is being able to watch Jamie, he is HOT and definitely keeps your interest!  I would highly recommend this DVD.  If you are not quick at picking up steps, there is a section you can go to that helps break it down.",1283212800,,682,4.1923076923076925
2733893,5,B000MGBLGE,"This DVD is hot.  The music is really hot, the moves are awesome, the production value and flow is top notch, and it's put together so you will really feel like rock star.

Basically, Jamie teaches you a full-on professional-quality dance routine (and nothing less).  That means it is challenging, both choreography-wise and physically!  But that's what's so great about it.  Although there is almost no repetition of anything (just like a real dance routine, and unlike a dedicated exercise vid), the breakdown is so good, it's not that hard to pick up.  I am not a pro dancer (never taken a dance class), but I was able to (kind of) do the performance by the third time I did it.  I've done other dance workout DVDs, and I have to say this is best broken down.  And the feeling of getting it at the final performance section is so awesome, it's totally worth it.

I think this DVD is for you if you want to learn a real pop/hip-hop routine and get a workout doing it.  It's not as intense as doing, say step aerobics, and it's really more like interval training as the half time breakdowns are interspersed in the middle of the full tempo sections.  BUT it does get your heart rate up, I do break a sweat, and this is way more motivating to do than step aerobics so I do a lot more of it than just plain old cardio workouts.

Other good points: Jamie is a great presenter and the dancers are all really good.  The best touch, though, has to be DJ Baktrack.  They actually have this live DJ in the background mixing the tunes.  It's actually a bit funny, as Jamie will shout out to DJ Baktrack randomly throughout the DVD, after which he cheers you on and does a bit of a clap and jive number.

Overall, this is one the best dance DVDs out there (if not THE best).",1277683200,2,1765,4.319148936170213
2733894,1,B000MGBLGE,This video was impossible to follow.  Way too fast!  Maybe after seveal attempts but I was looking for exercise not trying so much to learn some kind of dance like I was going to be on a broadway musical.,1277078400,2,204,4.205128205128205

2733901,2,B000MGBLGE,I didn't like this workout DVD. It goes too fast with too few practices before going full speed. Equally annoying is the jumping moves. I live in an apartment so I can't be jumping without getting in trouble with the people who live downstairs. There are better dance workout discs out there.

2733903,3,B000MGBLGE,"I've always admired Jaimie King and his dance style in music videos but I wish he would market several series of videos that cater to different levels.  I may not have a background in dance training but I could follow the moves during the warm-up to the more easier routines.  However by the time the moves became more complex, I was confused and frustrated with getting the steps right that I was missing out on a great workout.

The first time I played this on my DVD i felt like a complete stupid because i thought that they dance too fast for me, however, practising and with lot of atention Jamie not only make m dance but also he has kept me in shape.

This video is pretty fun and now I think that goes according to the rythm of the songs, I have lost like ten pounds and feel good with my progress, also has a bonus section for strenght your muscles, if you love Cardio You're gonna love this item.

Jamie does tend to talk a lot when it's not necessary, but I think it's all part of the ""gotta still be an exercise video"" thing & he tries to be encouraging to keep you going. I just wish they picked a different song for the ""performance"" (I like stuff with a stronger beat) & I wish the music was louder & more of the focus rather than Jamie's talking.

2733921,4,B000MGBLGE,"After reading some of the 1 and 2-star reviews I needed to respond.  See. . . when you go to a dance class for the first time, no one expects you to pick up on the routine right away.  You have to go a bunch of times before the ""lightbulb"" goes off and you suddenly catch onto the moves.  That's how this video is.  Sometimes you have to repeat the chapter a few times (isn't that the amazing thing about using a DVD????) in order to get the steps right.  It's not like a typical work out DVD where you can go straight through (unless you are a trained dancer) and it's also not as BORING!!!",1220140800,8,591,4.060344827586207

Unfortunately I hated it. This may just be personal preference but I thought the music was bad, the choreography was boring and Jamie's constant chatter annoying. The back-up dancers tend to look less than enthused and are often out-of-time with Jamie.

The moves are demonstrated very quickly and are hard to grasp the first time, but I'm never out-of-breath by the end of it. I put everything I have into the moves but they just don't work the muscles or get my heart rate up. I've done the workout about 10 times now, enough to convince myself it was worth the $15, although I've never made it to the end of the dvd--even with the sound muted--I always get too annoyed and just go run.

Then I forgot that a 13 yr old child has more energy than my energy soft drink. I got home and i just followed what Jamie told me. He said it was okay to make mistakes, and broke it down very well. Gave you enough practice to know the steps before putting it up to tempo. I also love the music, and he uses REAL Music that I've actually heard and it gets me pumped. Plus, he also makes it easier and puts difficult moves on the special features that play during the workout so you know it for good. The Performance is well worth getting to, You really do feel like a Rock star, and the next day you feel the burn. I even continue to do to the song so I can practice before I do the Video again! I LOVE IT! I never had so much fun while sweating in my Life!

Buy it, have fun and get ur workout!",1185667200,6,933,3.736040609137056
2733958,1,B000MGBLGE,"This is the 3rd time i've tried to write a review for this so i'll just keep it short and sweet. Jamie moves WAY too quick. He does't give you a chance to learn the moves before all of sudden expecting you to run through it tempo!!!
If you have dance experience this will work for you. It wasn't for me. I hated it...i couldn't keep up. I need to see something slowly or twice before i'm gonna be able to throw all those moves together at that fast of a pace!!",1183852800,8,460,4.010869565217392

With all the frustration I can't get a good work out in.  Do yourself a favor - there are great dance dvds out there - buy any other one but this!",1403049600,,311,3.9516129032258065

8168892,4,B000MGBLGE,"I liked this DVD, but unfortunately it was a little bit too advanced for my skills. The instructor breaks the steps down very well, but I found the moves to be quite advanced and very fast-paced. This workout is definitely not for a beginner or someone who is uncoordinated.",1376784000,,274,4.612244897959184
