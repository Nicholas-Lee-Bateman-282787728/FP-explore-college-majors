8107393,4,B000E8QVB0,"Shaq is such a charismatic guy and this video showed that. He will go down as one

 of the all time greats. This video was an enjoy to watch if you are a Shaq fan.",1299974400,,163,3.6285714285714286
8107394,1,B000E8QVB0,"An incredibly repetitive, self-indulgent waste of time. Roughly a third of the video is Shaq looking into the camera and explaining ""that's why I'm Shaquile O'Neal, Like No Other."" Just in case we forgot the name of the video. Some decent basketball footage, but not much. Virtually nothing on his college or Orlando years. Not even much on his time with the Lakers, and it was released prior to Miami's title so not much there either!",1295136000,,435,4.7368421052631575
8107395,5,B000E8QVB0,Shaquille O'Neal is truly a One of a Kind Basketball force. we aren't gonna see another Player like him for quite some time. since this DVD came out Shaq has added another Ring to his finger as the Miami Heat Won the title this past year. His Legacy continues to Grow.  wherever He goes he always brings a WInning Attitude&a Leadership quality. he makes teammates better&is a Winner.  this is a Great DVD for any fans of Shaq.,1155945600,2,426,4.448717948717949
