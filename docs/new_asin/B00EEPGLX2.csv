8604815,4,B00EEPGLX2,"I enjoy this concert very much, but it took some time to get it to play on my computer. You need to find a menu on which to select ""Playback"", then select ""Title 2"" before it will play. I had to figure this out myself. It plays easily on my DVD player.",1437177600,,252,3.8653846153846154
