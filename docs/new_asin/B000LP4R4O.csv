8162627,5,B000LP4R4O,"Freedom 7: America's First Space Flight was another five star DVD by Spacecraft Films. Features rare and often overlooked audio and visual materials of our first Mercury flight.

Learned many new facts and little known gossip about the Mercury Program after watching this great DVD. One of the best features was the several interviews granted by Commander Shepard around the time of his historic flight. All very interesting.

One item I learned was that Commander Shepard requested NASA to permit him a second flight aboard an additional Mercury orbital mission. This he requested personally from James Webb after Gordo Cooper's 22 orbit flight.  Webb did not agree and said we have to get onto our Gemini two man vehicle. Shepard asked if Mr. Webb minded his bringing up this topic with Jack Kennnedy who he was shortly having dinner with.  Mr. Web is reported to have said ""No, just don't forget to tell him how I feel about it"".

Al Shepard made the suggestion to the president and told him what he and his buddy astronauts had in mind for a final Mercury long duration mission that would be continued until consumables ran low. The president is reported to have asked what his boss thought of the idea, and Shepard was honest. Kennedy said he would have to side with his boss. This is only the first of several such tidbits offered by Commander Shepard during several interviews.",1243900800,,1384,4.798319327731092
8162628,5,B000LP4R4O,Great historic video of the first U.S. manned spaceflight. Beautiful artwork on cover of case. Item was everything expected.,1217116800,,124,5.578947368421052
8162629,4,B000LP4R4O,"I found the content to be excellent.  The format supurb.  I thought I knew the ""Freedom 7"" inside and out and Al like a friend.  This review had information I'd not heard before and captivated me with the information I already knew. Al Sheperd and Gus Grissom were the ""original astronaut heros"".  The history of the U.S. Space flight program would never have ""gotten off the ground"" without them.  Al was the spearhead and guiding force for it all the way from Freedom 7 to the moon.  This is the opening chapter of that oddessy and a real ""keeper"".",1202428800,,550,4.505050505050505
8162630,5,B000LP4R4O,"This single disc release represents the new stream of Spacecraftfilms materials dedicated to the particular manned missions. Logic behind the starting with Freedom 7 is obvious - the best start is from the beginning. I was curious to see what else can be released after the incredible six disc Mercury set - is there anything new which is not on the ""big"" set ? I am not disapointed, this material is an excellent adition to the main Mercury set. Part 1 contains official NASA and USIA movies on the flight plus a Spacecraftfilmsmade Mercury program summary.

Here I would like to make the viewers aware of a rare film footage in the US Information Agency short b/w movie - you have here the actual pickup of Al Shepard from the hooked cabin hanging below the helicopter #44! This kind of recovery is absolutely unique, it hapenned only once. The same was planned for Gus Grissom but went wrong completely, Glenn,  Schirra and Cooper have been brought onboard the recovery NAVY ships inside the cabin and egressed on the ship's deck. Scott Carpenter's egress was also unique, he left the cabin through the top hatch but due to the several hundreds kilometers landing site overshot no coverage exists.

 I never saw this first part of the Shepard's recovery on the film, a lot of photos only.

 Part 2 contains the Spacecraftfilms material on the Freedom 7 flight, the same like in the big Mercury set.

 Part 3 contains over 500 photos related to the flight, many of them rare and which is very nice it's not official photos only. You can see a lot of interesting shots in ""unguarded"" moments, I personaly like Gus Grissom ""making faces"" in front of the Freedom 7 periscope to - maybe - entertain Al Shepard sitting in the sealed cabin before the launch.
