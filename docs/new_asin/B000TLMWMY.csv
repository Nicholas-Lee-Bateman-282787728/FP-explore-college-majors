2906362,5,B000TLMWMY,"I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who just appreciates good music. I caught a sneak preview of this amazing disc on my local PBS station in August of 2007, and it was one of the greatest things I had seen on television in a long time. Johnny Cash's prime time television show aired from 1969 - 1971, and featured both prominent rock and country artists of the day. Groundbreaking television for sure, considering at the time that most rock artists were associated with the peace, drugs, free love and the anti-war movement by a conservative segment of American society, just when the war was really starting to sour. Filmed live at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee (with a few exceptions), in front of a mostly Southern country music audience, all the artists seemed to be warmly embraced by the crowd, with Johnny Cash's blessing and support. The first hour consisted of rock and popular music performers that Johnny Cash was an admirer or fan of, including Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, Neil Young, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Neil Diamond, Carl Perkins, and Jerry Lee Lewis. The highlight was Derek and the Dominoes featuring Eric Clapton, and following their performance none other than Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash himself joined Derek and the Dominoes onstage for a raucous version of Perkins' Matchbox. Simply amazing.
The second half was Johnny himself performing solo, with his wife June Carter Cash, and with the Tennessee Three. Prominent country artists also featured were George Jones, Tammy Wynette, a young, short-haired and beardless Hank Williams Jr., young Waylon Jennings, Loretta Lynn, Merle Haggard, and Charley Pride (possibly the only black country artist ever). These are only the performances shown on the PBS special preview. There were literally hundreds of great performances on this show over its two year run. There's no lip synching nonsense here. Every artist actually performing and singing live. This is priceless television and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of any of the artists I mentioned. You will not be disappointed. It won't be available until September of 2007, and I will most definitely be purchasing it.",1186444800,104,2204,5.074380165289257

2906364,4,B000TLMWMY,"Just seen the first DVD, very good. Performers of a level that couldn't possibly be in a show nowadays. And Cash is a great host. Only thing, some songs are in playback (being this a recorded show, not alive, they could have been played live) and some of them are TOO short (1/1& a half minute). I thing they made that on purpose precisely for scarse showtime; I guess some songs have been compacted or they asked the performer to shorten them in order to fit.",1501718400,,460,4.3604651162790695

They probably didn't use the best quality of vinyl.  Songs and performances are great and you can tell, even through just listening, they aren't lip-synced. I bought mine on RSD 2016 and I'm glad I did. It was only 17.99. Amazon is price-gouging now. Save your money and let some other dupe buy the LP here.

2906384,5,B000TLMWMY,"Among the stellar reviews and five-star ratings for this set are lower ratings complaining about what's left out--primarily, non-musical segments of the show.

Well, shall we talk about what this is, rather than what it isn't? What it is, is a condensed collection of amazing musical performances--that is, songs only--from a staggering array of pop and country singers on the cusp of the 70s. You can judge your own interest from the setlist. I'm here to tell you that if the list of names looks intriguing, you won't be disappointed. Everyone is at the top of their game and/or just arriving on the scene, and they perform with a palpable pleasure at being there and being hosted by The Man In Black. As an extra bonus: someone has taken a lot of trouble with the sound, because both the mix and the sonic quality are amazing for the time: when it's appropriate to mix the whole band as a unit rather than focus on the headliner, you hear every instrument clearly (what a marvelous band Kris Kristofferson was heading!). Even the camerawork feels surprisingly modern. Speaking as not-a-country-music-fan, I feel compelled to add that these people REALLY had something: Waylon Jennings was an excellent guitarist! George Jones wrote and performed stories in song that verge on literature! Tammy Wynette sings Stand By Your Man like it's a feminist anthem (stick with him, he's just a man).",1453766400,,1390,4.889830508474576
2906385,3,B000TLMWMY,"Very disappointed. It only shows the music acts singing and not really anything else. Aside from when he is preforming, Cash is barely in it. Don't know what I expected, but I certainly thought there would be more interaction with Johnny and the music acts preforming.

2906428,4,B000TLMWMY,"In 2007 a 16-track CD was released featuring highlight performances from the show's run.  This CD is a much better representation of the show than the 1970 LP&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-Johnny-Cash-Show-Columbia-KC-30100/dp/B000XQO1RY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the Johnny Cash Show (Columbia KC 30100)</a>.  It's got Cash singing his hits (Ring of Fire, Flesh and Blood), and others' (I've Been Everywhere), plus doing some of the classics with the Statler Brothers and the Carter Family (Belshazzar, Daddy Sang Bass).  Then, it throws in some solo performances by the stars who graced his stage, and a wonderful duet with Joni Mitchell on Girl from the North Country.

A two-disc DVD expanded this to a full 66-song set (and swapped Joni's duet on North Country for Bob Dylan's - they're both amazing).  As you explore the number of artists who performed on Johnny's show, you get a real sense of what he was trying to do.  All of the country greats were there: Tammy Wynette, George Jones, a hilarious Roy Clark, Bobby Bare, Conway Twitty, Marty Robbins, the Everly Brothers, Ray Price, Chet Atkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, Loretta Lynn, Charley Pride, and Bill Monroe.  They're all in fine form, particular Glen Campbell's glorious Wichita Lineman.  Then there's the new breed of singer-songwriters Johnny loved so much: Tony Joe White, Kris Kristofferson, Linda Ronstadt, Hank Williams Jr., James Taylor, and Waylon Jennings.  He also moves beyond Nashville to those long-haired rock and roll freaks: Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, and CCR.  I love in particular how he brings in African-American artists who only a short while ago would have been banned from Ryman's all-white stage: Stevie Wonder (who plays drums on Get Rhythm!) and the great Louis Armstrong (who, with Johnny, recreates a 1930 session he played on with Jimmie Rogers; the sight of Louis in a 10-gallon hat is unforgettable!).  Although Cash was a country artist, he saw no boundaries.

This was no more apparent than in his stunning duet on Worried Man Blues with Pete Seeger.  Godfather of modern folk music he may be, but I often find Pete's rigid stance on so many issues to be offputting.  Here though, he offers a masterclass in showmanship and musicianship.  Johnny and Pete together are wonderful.  And somehow, Cash manages to get his middle-American audience to gobble up the melodies of America's most famous lefty!

The CD and DVD are great, but in the age of YouTube, somewhat irrelevant.  For every great performance on here, there's another omitted: The Monkees in full comedic form; a very psychedelic The Guess Who interspersed with Johnny's What is Truth; and a to-die-for guitar jam session between Jose Feliciano, Carl Perkins and Merle Travis. A complete remastered box set is needed!

What a great cast of artists who stopped by. Sometimes JC was a bit ""solemn"" (I was going to say ""pompous"") but maybe that was the style on TV at the time and some passages are priceless. Especially the Waylon Jennings segment. I'd heard about Waylon via The Highwaymen but ""Only Daddy"" really knocked my socks off and I've been scrambling to find out more about him since and getting deeper into his music. The dialogue with JC is good fun as their ""When Waylon's out of Town"" duo too!",1295049600,,623,4.288135593220339

Johnny Cash's connection with the live studio audience was remarkable, and is a reminder of why this TV series was so popular. Performances by Kris Kristofferson (who narrates), Waylon Jennings, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, and Eric Clapton were among the most memorable.  Duets with Johnny and June Carter Cash are touching, especially since both of them have passed away. For all of us who were glued to the TV from the moment we heard ""Hello, I'm Johnny Cash"" at the start of every show, this is a must-have collection.",1274832000,,653,4.769911504424779

I enjoyed the variety of guests he had on his program and it showed a wide range of talent during that time period. I'm so glad to add this DVD to my collection of Cash music and videos.",1270944000,,443,4.2
2906455,5,B000TLMWMY,"This is a great, but incomplete, companion to the terrific DVD of the Johnny Cash TV Show.  All the performances are enjoyable and some are absolute gems.  Ray Charles' killer take on Ring of Fire is worth the price of the disk all on its own (when I saw the performance on the DVD it was the one that made me wish there was also a DVD).  The Derek and the Dominos track, Kristoferson singing his own ""Loving Her Was Easier"" and Johnny, June, the Tennessee Three, Statler Bros and Carl Perkins on Belshazzar also stand out.  That said, you have to wonder why so many other great performances available on the DVD are left off the CD (Johnny and Bob Dylan on Girl from the North Country, Neil Young & Needle & the Damage Done,Johnny singing Sunday Morning Coming Down - which Kris K. says on the DVD made him, etc).  Maybe there are other disks in the future?  The other shortcoming are the fairly short and uninformative liner notes, which are a consistent shortfall of the posthumous JC releases.  Given that this disk and the American Recordings are co-produced by John Carter Cash it would seem reasonable to expect liner notes with some insights - in this case about the making of the Johnny Cash show, how Johnny got the great artists to appear on the show, his impressions of singing with them, how the tracks were selected, etc.  All of that said, as written in the liner notes, Johnny was groundbreaking in recording these live performances to 8-track and had the foresight to preserve them so we are lucky to have them at all - why nit-pick.  The liner notes also provide a disclaimer that the sound quality of the disk reflects the relatively poor source material but, knowing the source, the sound is quite good and more than satisfactory.  This is a treat for Johnny Cash fans and a time capsule from a unique era.  NOTE: Many of the other reviews are for the DVD of the Johnny Cash Show, not this CD.",1269993600,,1913,4.484149855907781

The only incongruous performer is Joni Mitchell, who seems atrangely out of place and key.

However, there are a few many artists no one ever heard of, and not enough of the ones I remember, like Mama Cass Elliott, who are missing from the dvd.  Overall quality is good and I liked John Carter Cash' narrative.  The price was very low for this dvd, I would think it would have sold for more, but because of the occasional artist no one ever heard of, it lowers the value of the product.  I also wish there had been more 'Ride This Train' segments - those were the highlight of the show for me.",1254528000,,663,4.076923076923077

2906461,5,B000TLMWMY,"The only problem with the Johnny Cash Show was that it didn't last long enough.  But between 1969 and 1971 the show managed to capture great performances by a remarkably diverse group of musical performers.  Cash insisted that the performers all sing live, so you will find no lip synching on this (my only doubt was Marty Robbins -- I could not see a microphone anywhere during his performance).  So this is a great collection of performances by a long string of inductees into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Country Music Hall of Fame.  Because the performances are really, truly live, they are not always pretty.  Johnny and Roy Orbison, for instance, do a great but rather ragged version of ""Pretty Woman.""

The two discs are very, very different.  The first disc features narration by Kris Kristofferson as well as brief interviews with individuals involved with the show.  The second disc consists almost exclusively of performances from the show, with interviews popping up only near the end of the disc.  But between the two discs you get a stunning number of memorable performances.  Musical guests include Bob Dylan, Kris Kristofferson, Louis Armstrong (with Johnny reprising Armstrong's 1930 recording with Jimmie Rodgers of ""Standing on the Corner [Blue Yodel No. 9""]), Stevie Wonder, Creedence Clearwater Revival, an incredibly beautiful Linda Ronstadt, George Jones, Waylon Jennings, Tammy Wynette, Marty Robbins, James Taylor, Pete Seeger, Neil Young, Mother Maybelle Carter, Joni Mitchell, Derek and the Dominoes, Carl Perkins, Charlie Pride, Bill Monroe, Loretta Lynn, Jerry Lee Lewis, the Everly Brothers (and their dad), Ray Charles, Conway Twitty, Glen Campbell, Neil Diamond, Ray Price, Roy Orbison, Chet Atkins, Homer and Jethro, and Merle Haggard.

A number of Johnny Cash's old Sun Records label mates appear on the show, including Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, and Jerry Lee Lewis.  One thing that I found fascinating about Orbison's appearance was that he was not, as he so often did, wearing sunglasses.  His very thick glasses were somewhat dark, but not the shades you usually see.

I recently read a marvelous book on Jimmie Rodgers by Barry Mazor entitled MEETING JIMMIE RODGERS.  Being more attuned to Rodgers than usual, I was struck by what a prominent role Rodgers played on this show.  You not only had several performers for whom Jimmie Rodgers was a major influence -- Johnny Cash, Bill Monroe, George Jones, and Merle Haggard -- but two people who actually recorded with Rodgers, Louis Armstrong and Mother Maybelle Carter (as Mazor points out in his book, Maybelle had the distinction of being the only person to record with Jimmie Rodgers, Hank Williams, and Elvis Presley, not to mention the Carter Family).  There are several Rodgers songs performed on the show, most notably Armstrong and Cash on ""Blue Yodel No. 9"" and Merle Haggard on ""No Hard Times.""  Haggard's most recent album, in fact, at the time of his first appearance on Johnny's show was SAME TRAIN, DIFFERENT TIME, his all-Jimmie Rodgers cover album.  Along with Ernest Tubb, Hank Snow, and Lefty Frizzell, the two most prominent performers to do their best to promote the music of Jimmie Rodgers have been Merle Haggard and Johnny Cash.  That certainly comes across on this show.

If you love music, this is a must-see two-disc set.  If you have narrow musical tastes, you might not enjoy it, but if you have broad, wide-ranging tastes this will be persistently exciting.",1245456000,,3489,5.041811846689895

Some of the details about the guests are interesting and amusing.  Linda Ronstadt was 35 years ahead of her time in the wardrobe department. It's too bad we can't get quality shows like this on TV today. This DVD set brought back a lot of good memories and is definitely a good value.,1207440000,,423,4.6
2906489,5,B000TLMWMY,"Johnny Cash's 58 episodes of prime time television, stretching from late 1969 into early 1971 were broadcast, musical and social landmarks all in one. In a society roiled by the Vietnam War, a generation gap, racism, and numerous other divisions, Cash parlayed his artistry, broad musical vision, experienced opinions, faith and personal integrity into a television series that crisscrossed the American landscape. This two-DVD set excerpts four hours of material from the series, providing a good sense of the show's overall breadth and depth. Both discs intersperse short interview segments (with Kris Kristofferson, John Carter Cash and original show staff) to explain just how radical were many of the show's elements.

Cash brought his ease as a stage performer to the improvised studio of Nashville's Ryman Auditorium. He played easily to both the cameras and the live audience, making this a hybrid of a concert being taped and a television show with an audience to generate applause. The shows offer the energy and edginess of live performance with the polish of a studio program. The production, audio, video and staging teams all did superb jobs. The sets vary between large abstract shapes (ala Hullabaloo) and cozy suburban living rooms; the lighting is colorful and flattering to the performers and the sound is captured surprisingly well. Columbia/Legacy's engineers have done a terrific job of remixing from the multi-track master tapes. The video shows a few artifacts in the margins but is generally quite good, and the color is fine.

The guest list reached forward to the cutting edge, but also backward with segments highlighting the contributions of acts like Bill Monroe, Homer & Jethro, The Carter Family and Cash's Sun labelmates, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis and Roy Orbison. The list of contemporary acts from country, folk, soul and rock is astounding. Starting with Bob Dylan on show #1, Cash gathered what he thought to be important and interesting talents to present to both his Nashville audience in the Ryman, and to those tuning in nationwide. He challenged his audience with the controversial and defiantly anti-war Pete Seeger, bringing him on to play banjo and sing ""Cripple Creek"" before moving him to the front of the stage to lead a sing-a-long of ""Worried Man Blues."" By the time Cash rejoins him, Seeger has the crowd nervously singing along.

Another fascinating guest is Louis Armstrong, featured less than a year before his passing. Cash and Armstrong recreate a 1930's session on which the latter backed the father of country music, Jimmie Rodgers. For those who only remember Armstrong's grin and ""Hello Dolly,"" his trumpet playing here will quickly inform you of his seminal role in the history of American music. Merle Haggard provides another tribute to Jimmie Rodgers with a version of ""No Hard Times,"" before sitting down with Cash to sing his own ""Sing Me Back Home."" Hank Williams Jr., clean-cut and in a western suit (that is, before the sunglasses and hat), provides a moving tribute to his father.

Established country stars George Jones, Marty Robbins and Tammy Wynette show just why they were stars. Jones voice is in stellar form - it's almost hard to believe he's singing live - as he swings through a medley of three classic songs. Robbins was a Ryman favorite, and you can hear the audience hooting and hollering as he sings a medley of his western hits that culminates with an abridged version of ""El Paso."" Wynette's performance gains the most from its video dimension. The close-ups of her face reveal an emotional connection to ""Stand By Your Man"" that goes well beyond the vocal.  The stark staging of singers with the accompanying band off-stage will make you long for a time when vocalists were sufficiently fetching performers to hold your attention without dancers and other razzle-dazzle.

Cash's selection of mavericks is similarly spot-on. Kris Kristofferson appears young, long-haired, and clear-eyed as he sings ""Loving Her Was Easy."" It's a stark contrast to the grizzled veteran interviewed in the documentary segments. Waylon Jennings, clean shaven and with his hair still slicked back, was well on his way to presenting country music with the fire of a rock band. His bassist sports a flower-power sticker on his Fender axe, Jessi Colter hots things up playing organ, and his cover of Chuck Berry's ""Brown Eyed Handsome Man"" shows how fluidly he created music out of multiple genres. Cash offered a surprisingly honest and potent introduction to Neil Young's ""The Needle and the Damage Done"" by discussingg his own drug use on location with college students.

Among the happiest-to-be-there guests is Creedence Clearwater's John Fogerty. He seems to be having a religious experience singing ""Bad Moon Rising"" at the Ryman, and was probably thinking about Carl Perkins (who was backstage as a member of Cash's troupe) as he picked the break. Another guitarist who had Perkins on his mind was Eric Clapton. After playing a tune with Derek and the Dominos, Clapton and Perkins happily swap licks on the latter's Sun era hit, ""Matchbox,"" with Cash strumming and singing along. Cash was perfect at slipping in and out of his guest's sets, sitting with Ray Charles on the piano bench as he growls out an amazing gospel arrangement of ""I Walk the Line,"" then slipping away as Charles swings into a slow, soulful version of ""Ring of Fire.""

Cash's entourage of Carl Perkins, The Tennessee Three, Mother Maybelle Carter and her daughters (June, Anita and Helen) and the Statler Brothers also got their share of stage time. The Tennessee Three could flatten you with the powerful, locomotive rhythm of ""Big River,"" and June Carter Cash is featured singing the terrific original, ""A Good Man,"" filled with the questions of day (the war, the environment, the generation gap) and an appeal to faith for solutions. Mother Maybelle can be spied playing her autoharp and picking her beloved Gibson, and of course, Cash's own musical segments find him at one of his performing peaks.

It's hard to imagine anyone else with the talent, range and personal gravitas to hold this show together from the center. Hosts like Ed Sullivan could arrange and produce shows, but only Cash could have been the performing ringmaster who worked with the musicians at their own level. It was the context of his personal endorsements that bound these disparate artists into a fluid, entertaining, educational and ultimately impactful whole. Whether or not the entire series is ever remastered and released, these two DVDs are both a solidly entertaining four hours of treasures, and a wonderfully selected overview of the series.

2906506,5,B000TLMWMY,"The Best of the Johnny Cash Show is a fascinating look at the history of American popular music.  Louis Armstrong plays ""Blue Yodel #9,"" just as he did on Jimmie Rodgers' 1930 recording.  James Taylor makes his network television debut on the show.  June Carter made Linda Ronstadt put on bloomers before she was allowed to sit onstage next to Johnny in her short skirt.  Mother Maybelle Carter, Pete Seegar, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, George Jones--they're all there, and more.  Master picker Norman Blake was a guitarist in the house band, as was the incredible Carl Perkins.  Perkins' performance of ""Blue Suede Shoes"" is incredible, and ""Matchbox"" with Perkins, Clapton, and Cash recalls the glory days of Sun Studios in Memphis.

Completely non-pretentious, everything's mic'd up separately and live (no digital enhancements or huge mixing boards).  It takes place in a famous theatre that looks like more like a southern evangelical church.

I guess the best part is watching legends of rock, country and blues in their primes, or in their youth, make brief appearances and managing to blow away the crowd.

Everything else has been said here for the most part, it's just something you can truly appreciate and enjoy, even if you aren't the biggest Cash or country fan, but love the roots of country, rock or the blues.

One minute Dylan's strumming his guitar with Johnny in front of the fire place, the next has Jerry Lewis kicking his piano bench off the stage during one if his mid-song fits, Bill Monroe belting out his classic bluegrass, a clean cut Hank Jr. showing off his beautiful country voice, or Neil Young eliciting a standing ovation, and it goes on and on like this...just amazing footage, and reminds me of what TV used to be like in the 70's, with our 4 channels.

2906520,4,B000TLMWMY,"I don't remember seeing the Johnny Cash show when it first aired,(I was too young)and I don't think my parents do too. They always liked country music and had Hee-Haw, The Tommy Hunter show, Dolly, Barbera Mandrell, etc. on the T.V.(that much I do remember)so, they probably did watch this show. I never cared much for country music when I was young but when Johnny came on T.V. well, that was different. I always found him different from the other country hick singers of the time, he seemed more of a rebel, dangerous, you'd almost say with his deep voice, black clothes and dark music.
  Fast-forward to today. As I've grown older I've gained an appreciation for those corny hick country stars of yesteryear I used to scoff at. When I viewed part of this DVD compilation on PBS, I was intrigued and very thankful that somebody had the forsight to create this time capsule ,of sorts, for future fans to see. I bought this for my parents for chistmas and have heard nothing but good reviews from them (hopefully they'll let me watch it one of these days).So buy it!!!",1199836800,2,1068,4.5863874345549736

I am guessing that, if you are reading this, you are the kind of person who will feel incomplete until you actually hear Johnny Cash and Louis Armstong play together, and you will not be disappointed when you do.  Ray Charles turns in an incredible performance.  Check out everyone from Neil Young to Tammy Wynette too.

2906532,5,B000TLMWMY,"I'm not quite sure why the single DVD set is $12.99 and this, the 2 DVD set, is almost three times that at $35.00, but I can tell you it is worth every penny.  As is pointed out in this excellent program, back then there were only 3 channels; the Johnny Cash show was on ABC, which we didn't get (that's right, there were only 3 channels, and we got CBS and NBC, and sometimes, when the weather wasn't right, NBC would be snowy.  I'm 52, in case you're wondering how many centuries ago that was).  Which means that I missed it the first time around, and as far as I know, it NEVER was syndicated.  So this is my first look at a program that, as far as I'm concerned, was both revolutionary and unique in that it was all about music.  No stupid skits (I don't think), no bad comedians, no amazing plate-spinning.  Just music.  But not just any music....all music!  Be it country, rock, pop, bluegrass, jazz, soul...he had the biggest and the best.  Too bad the Beatles were busting up when this show started, because he would have no doubt tried to coax them out as well.

And no lip-synching on this show, no sir (and ma'am).  Real live.  Just to have all of these amazing performances collected would be a treat and a treasure.  But this is really so much more.  It's the man and the stories behind what made these amazing performances happen.  I have to think that at that point in the history of music, only Johnny Cash could have made something so amazing as this happen.  Only Johnny Cash could have served up such a rich and varied musical program to the American public, all pretty much straight up and unadulterated.  No one else could have beat down the censors; no one else could have convinced a real country fan to actually sit through a performance of Stevie Wonder.

But Johnny Cash could...and did.  He was at the absolute apex of his career.  He's always walked a fine line between rock'n'roll and country, but his crossover was made complete by the enormous success of A Boy Named Sue and Ring of Fire.  I was barely in my teens and did NOT like country, but I did like Johnny Cash.  It was hard to find people who did not like him.  ABC lucked into a masterstroke.  I'm assuming they gave him great license and I'm assuming he followed his heart in assembling this glorious showcase of talent from the entire landscape of American music in the late '60s and early '70s.  I certainly hope so.  It couldn't have been a calculated marketing move, could it? Nah!

Without getting too deep into musicology, this was a remarkable time for ""pop"" music, when you could hear almost anything on your top 40 AM station.  That time,sadly, was quickly drawing to an end, and, thanks to The Johnny Cash Show, it has been brillaintly preserved for posterity.  I don't think anything else comes close.  Ed Sullivan was great, but didn't hold a candle to this.  The Smothers Brothers Show was also great, but the main emphasis was comedy, not music (both on CBS, see, so I did watch those shows).  Music was not incidental here, it was aimed at music lovers, and that's what I am.  I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to watch it when I was a kid.  I don't know that it would have changed my life, but I do know it would have enhanced it a great deal, and exposed me to many artists that I didn't discover until many years later, if ever.

Anyway, these DVDS are magic and actually it's a miracle that they exist.  You cannot take miracles lightly and you certainly can't afford to be without one that costs a mere $35.  Cheap price for a piece of magic but an absolute STEAL for a miracle.",1198713600,3,3587,4.388467374810318

2906538,5,B000TLMWMY,"Johnny Cash has always been a pert of my musical experience.  His wisdom in life and recognizing other talented people is what i admire the most out of him.  He has helped more musicians than anyone else during his time.  And those folks were fans and loved his craft before he discovered them only to continue to adore him and appreciate his humble gestures.  The one shining example is Trent Reznor from NIN.  When johnny covered the song hurt it accentuated the despair that the song has and it proved to be one of trent's most cherished moments to hear his version of hurt.

Well in this dvd shot in the late 70's Johnny is at it again.  the great moments of his tv show shot in the famed Ryman theater in Nashville at a time when the music and artist were not mainstream is pure genius.  There are some vintage performances on this dvd sure to attract fans of music be it country rock or blues it's all here.

How wonderful to see Waylon when he was young and thin and without the hair on his face.  Ditto a very young Bob Dylan.  What a joy to see Cash and Seeger together and for Cash's having him on despite Seeger's being blacklisted (in the seventies, no less!).  And for Cash refusing to change the word ""stoned"" in ""Sunday Morning Coming Down.""  Johnny stood up for what he believed it and lots of times we had no idea of his courage.

For me, guys like Johnny, Waylon, George Jones and gals like Tammy Wynette, Linda Ronstadt were simply great.  of course Johnny Cash is in a class of his own.

There was nothing on TV before, during, or since, that has captivated me like the Johnny Cash Show.  I've waited almost 40 years for someone to release this masterpiece on a format where I could own this treasure and here it is.  I'm greedy though, I'd like for them to release the entire series, all 58 shows in their entirety and the CBS summer replacement shows along with all of his CBS specials too.  But for now this ""Best of the JCS"" is by for my most treasured memory of Johnny and June.  This was THE ONE show that everyone in my family watched and enjoyed every minute of it.  I remember that last episode when Johnny said that he wasn't going to be back for another season, I cried like a baby, it was as if my dad had told me that I was never going to see him again.  It hurt.  I was 11.  This DVD shows live performances, no lip synching here.  Johnny was always better in a LIVE performance vs. a studio recording.  If there was only ONE Johnny Cash item you could own, this would be the one.  (At least until they'd come out with the entire series.)",1191456000,13,1206,4.124463519313305
2906561,4,B000TLMWMY,"Oh how young they looked and how few of these stars are still with us today. Johnny Cash was the true Nashville rebel, bringing to the country music stage for his TV show such hippy-dippy heroes as Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Creedence Clearwater Revivial, Joni Mitchell and Eric Clapton in their prime along with traditional country stars of the day. The Cash show aired from 1969-1971, right in the middle of the most exciting, dynamic era of America popular culture. The Cash ""larger-than-life legend"" has always eluded me, however. I never liked his constipated vocals, the strange haunted look, or some of the twitching mannerisms. I always got the impression the years of drug abuse in the '60s did some lasting damage. The whole Man In Black routine seemed like a cheap gimmick as well, or worse, a sort of messiah complex. Why should Johnny Cash have the weight of the world on his shoulders? (Even Billy Graham is able to wear a blue suit.) So I purchased this video for the guest stars, and they're great! A heavily made-up Bob Dylan does ""I Threw It All Away"" and you can actually understand his vocals. It's a definite highlight. Neil Young does ""The Needle And The Damage Done."" A bright-eyed Kris Kristofferson does ""Loving Her Was Easier (Than Anything I'll Ever Do Again)."" You also get Loretta Lynn, George Jones, Waylon Jennings, Roy Orbison, Merle Haggard, Ray Charles, Carl Perkins, Tammy Wynette and the Statler Brothers. The most interesting performance for this reviewer has to be Eric Claption fronting Derek And The Dominos on the countryish song ""It's Too Late."" This early 1971 performance was probably one of the last times Clapton was able to perform on stage before his heroin jones put him out of commission for a while. (Check out his tragic showing with George Harrison at the Concert For Bangladesh later that year.) Though it was taped in Nashville, the Cash show had a decidedly urban look, with bright, garish, psychedelic stage sets that really catch the eye. This video has aired on PBS stations across the country but it's certainly worth owning on DVD.",1191196800,31,2088,4.835195530726257

2906566,5,B000TLMWMY,"I'll apply to this 2-disc set a frequently abused adjective that in this case is altogether justified: incredible.

A word on format: Disc 1 is more a documentary, with narrative--aptly hosted by Kris Kristofferson at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium--and interviews presiding over excerpts from the ABC Cash series. Disc 2 reverses the angle: It's a compilation of many ""greatest hits"" from among the 57 hours, with only occasional commentary. Among those interveiwed are Marshall Grant and Bill Williams, the arranger and director of the series' pit orchestra. Predictably, both are very informative. Excerpts from the series are well balanced, reflecting the original's spirit: Cash at the center, country-heavy yet eclectic, a spot of gospel here, a touch of Opry farce there, ""Ride This Train,"" and the ensemble conclusions.

A word of rebuttal: Already there are those complaining that we haven't been given every installment in its entirety. Let's curb our impatience and be grateful for what we have: beautifully restored, well edited, representative samples of the show, whose purchase now might pave the way for more to follow. Those who may complain that there's not enough Cash and too much (fill in the blank) should remember that this star was extraordinarily gracious in giving so much time to his guests and to duets with them. Furthermore, let's remember that there are few legal knots more tangled than the reproduction of music, because the rights for use are so complicated: the songwriter, the lyricist, the publisher, the arrangement, the performers, their unions, etc. I consider it a miracle that we have been given here so much, not so little. To pronounce a rare benediction: God bless the lawyers in this project!

As to the DVDs themselves, I repeat myself: incredible. We have Cash, at the very peak of his mid-career height, who was never better than when performing live before an appreciative audience. We have the unsung yet ever reliable Carl Perkins with the Tennessee Three (Grant, Bob Wooton, Fluke Johnson), tearing up the pea-patch. Mother Maybelle Carter and the Carter Sisters, all still young. The Statler Brothers, beginning to make their own name with ""Flowers on the Wall"" (which they perform here, after their Grammy Award). Those are ""only"" the regulars. The guest stars nearly comprise a Who's Who of American music in the '60s: Bill Monroe, doing the ""Elvis version"" of ""Blue Moon of Kentucky."" Louis Armstrong. Bob Dylan. Joni Mitchell. Chet Atkins. Ray Charles--whose soul version of ""Ring of Fire"" has to be heard and seen to be believed. From Cash's Sun days, Jerry Lee Lewis and Roy Orbison. Derek and the Dominoes (representing country music's influence on America's British Invasion of the 60s). And on and on and on.

A must for Cash fans, this set should be purchased by anyone wanting a time capsule of popular music in the mid-twentieth century. Utterly entertaining and, at almost four hours, cheap at the price.",1190246400,27,2969,5.115463917525773
2906567,3,B000TLMWMY,"Having been a Johnny Cash fan since I was a teenager, and having watched his variety show on television when it was first aired, I was delighted to hear about this new, two DVD set containing many highlights from his variety show.  And although it contains a lot of wonderful music--such as Johnny and Louis Armstrong singing an old Jimmy Rodgers standard--it's puzzling as to what the producers decided to leave out.  I can think of quite a few superb examples of performances that have not been included in this set that I remember seeing on the show when first aired, but let me just site two.  On the very first program of the series, Bob Dylan did an amazing version of his song ""Living the Blues"" which was far superior to his studio version on ""Self Portrait,"" which came out around the same time.  Yet, instead of  ""Living the Blues,"" we get ""I Threw It All Away;"" a nice number to be sure, but very similar to the version on Dylan's ""Nashville Skyline"" album.  The live ""Living the Blues,"" that Dylan did has never had an official release, either on video or on audio, although it's shown up on many Dylan bootlegs.  Similarly,  on that very first show of the series, Johnny and Joni Mitchell did an unforgettable version of Johnny's own song ""I Still Miss Someone,"" and yet instead of this, we get ""The Long Black Veil;"" it too is nice but hardly compares to their heartbreaking rendition of ""I Still Miss Someone."" Although this DVD set remains a good  sampling of what the series had to offer, and contains some very remarkable music, I would hardly call it ""the Best"" of the Johnny Cash variety show.  Perhaps if there's a Vol. 2 DVD, it will include the two numbers I've sited above as well as other remarkable numbers that were left off of this set.",1190246400,26,1764,4.518867924528302
2906568,5,B000TLMWMY,"Okay...I remember watching this show when it first aired...but in retrospect its importance is  unrivaled..and this presentation is spectacular!  Other than the opening tracks with Dylan which are middling quality on the video side of things...the visuals are typically first rate network quality.  The performances are even a higher level. Some of the musical icons of the century and that is NOT an overstatement... performing  classic repertoire, and doing it well. Whether its a clean shaven Waylon Jennings or glittery Tammy Wynette...long haired (yes he wasn't always bald) James Taylor...you can read the entire roster of guest performers and the list is exhaustive. its a stunning collection of musical hall  of famers!  This is a prime example of finding gold in old film vaults... I  only wish Johnny had survived and could contribute...but his old pal Kris Kristofferson is a great host!",1190160000,9,898,5.28169014084507
2906569,5,B000TLMWMY,"The tapes of the old Johnny Cash Show are a real snapshot of an era when songwriting and performance were highly prized.  This 2 disc set presents an outstanding collection of performances culled from the series featuring a wide range of artists.  Johnny Cash was a fearless promoter of good songs no matter who was performing them.  So in addition to the country stars you might expect on his show, he also had the major rock bands and folk artists of the day.  You get performances from such country legends as George Jones, Charlie Pride, Merle Haggard, and Loretta Lynn, alongside performers such as Eric Clapton, Dylan, Ray Charles, and Neil Young.  The show was set up such that all the performances are done live-- no lipsyncing here, botched or otherwise!  And Cash often sits with his guests and does a duet, which makes for some memorable moments.  For instance, he does Jimmie Rodgers' Blue Yodel #9 with Louis Armstrong playing trumpet along with him.  And Ray Charles does a seemingly impromptu version of Cash's own Walk the Line.  Another fine moment is when Cash, Carl Perkins, and Eric Clapton team up to perform an old standard song (accompanied by the rest of Derek and the Dominoes, in a rare TV appearance).  Clapton is standing there next to Perkins, one of his heros, and he looks almost intimidated.  To see someone like Clapton be practically shy around one of the people who inspired him to play is a wonderful moment. And of course the one man who could straddle all these various musical worlds and bring them together is Cash himself.  This DVD set is a real tribute to him.",1190160000,10,1603,4.685714285714286
2906570,5,B000TLMWMY,"I've been waiting to see these shows for, well, forever! Up until now the only way to see these performances was on bootleg video (although I believe the CMT Network ran some of these at one time)and YouTube. This is some amazing music from a man who simply loved playing good music. And good musicians, young and old, black and white. It's a shame it lasted barely 2 years. But it's a blessing that someone had the smarts to preserve these wonderful shows. This will be worth it for the Clapton and Dylan footage. There is precious little performance footage of his tenure with Derek and the Dominos, and here he really shines. You can tell by his face how amazed he is to be onstage jamming with both Cash and Carl Perkins. I've never seen Dylan's performance but this was (arguably) his first ever live tv performance, he'd been out of the spotlight since his 1966 motorcycle accident and gone back to his folky roots while the rest of the world turned up the volume. So this is prime Dylan with one of his idols. As well as seeing CCR at their peak. The Neil Young footage can also be seen on the special edition of his ""Live at Massey Hall"" CD. Can't wait!",1189728000,7,1161,4.404651162790698
2906571,5,B000TLMWMY,"This two-disc set collects highlights of Johnny Cash's short-lived musical variety show, which aired on network TV between 1969-71.  At the peak of the hippies-vs.-straights culture clash, Cash boldly invited guests from across the American musical spectrum -- longhairs, country traditionalists, Nashville insiders, jazz musician, rock stars, pop tunesmiths and folkies. The guest list is truly astonishing, given the tensions of the times.  Bob Dylan -- one of Cash's favorite artists -- was on the first show in '69, tipping viewers off that this wasn't gonna be your typical country TV show. Appearances by Neil Young, Eric Clapton, Joni Mitchell, Linda Ronstadt, Stevie Wonder and John Fogerty followed, as well as master entertainers such as Louis Armstrong and Ray Charles.  And of course, there was the cream of the country crop -- Waylon Jennings, Ray Price, Marty Robbins, George Jones, Loretta Lynn and Johnny's crew from his road show -- June Carter Cash & the Carter Family, the Statler Brothers, Carl Perkins and others.  In the wings were some amazing sidemen: keep an eye out for Norman Blake plucking acoustic guitar, as well as the wealth of up-and-coming talent that Cash went out of his way to promote (notably Kris Kristofferson, who reminisces about the old shows in interview segments added in this DVD set...)

This is a great collection, generously programmed (the set list on the Menu  goes on for page after page...) and many of the performances are pure gold (George Jones is awesome!)  Some fans will complain that they'd rather see the original shows as broadcast at the time, and while I agree that that would be fun, I don't see any reason to give anything but praise to this set.  The documentary format, with various Cash crew and compatriots interviewed and introducing different segments, is kinda cool, and for the most part they know when to get out of the way and let the music play.  It's a pity they didn't shoot the whole TV show on film -- some of the video stock gets kinda flared out (the Dylan clips, in particular) but, hey -- that's history for you.  Personally, I'm glad to see whatever stuff like this there is -- it's a great look back at an interesting cultural moment, when mainstream country was still pretty traditional, although the walls were starting to fall and new influences were coming into play.  Cash fans and country fans alike will want to check this one out! (DJ Joe Sixpack)",1189209600,56,2442,4.88861985472155

Why can't somebody (finally) get it right and issue complete variety series in there entirety?  Geez, it only lasted two years!  You could probably fit every episode in one or two boxed sets with double-sided DVDs, which so many companies do nowadays.  Instead, we get all complete seasons of Friends when all one needs to do is turn on the TV at any given time of the day and see the same episodes in syndication - as bad as seeing I Love Lucy continuously until we have the complete dialogs memorized!
