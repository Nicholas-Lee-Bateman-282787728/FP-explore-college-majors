8084450,5,0966056949,I did not think you could buy a tape anymore.  Glad I have held onto my VHS player.  I actually have not had a chance to watch the tape yet.  But it has gotten really good reviews from other boaters.  The tape came by the shipping date promised.  It was packed well so no damage.  Thank you.,1377475200,,291,4.017543859649122

This video covers the roll too.  Sweep and C-to-C.  Not in depth, but enough to study from.  It also covers eddy turns and peel outs as well as carving and other necessary techniques.",1061510400,,374,4.455882352941177
