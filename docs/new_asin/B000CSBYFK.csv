8101700,3,B000CSBYFK,"""Do you believe you decided to come to this theatre today? That it was your own idea? Of your own.. free will?"" Stanley Kramer's The Domino Principle begins with a lengthy and truly surreal paranoid rant delivered in voice over by a stern Patrick Allen sounding for all the world like the managing director of a ball bearings firm who's been slipped a peyote LSD chaser and handed a script written by an out-of-his head Dennis Hopper after reading too much Franz Kafka as captions reading `ASSASSINATION' (in several languages) and 'WHAT AUTHORITY DO THEY REPRESENT? are intercut with photos and stock footage of murders, state buildings, Vietnam and prison to underline the point that we're all part of a giant conspiracy. You almost expect him to end it with ""I'm not wearing any trousers and I've got a gun.""

So it's a genuine surprise that the film itself is not some Ed Wood version of a 70s conspiracy thriller but an altogether more sedate affair, with good naturalistic performances from a strong cast and some impressive visuals (although the last shot is [I]very[/I] familiar to any fans of Michael Caine's early 70s work). Gene Hackman is the Vietnam vet and ace marksman sprung from prison by Richard Widmark's mysterious government middleman in return for an undisclosed favor at a later date, though it doesn't take a genius to see where this is headed when his convincingly foul-mouthed cellmate Mickey Rooney is killed by his new friends as excess baggage. Pretty soon everyone he sees that THEY don't want him to ends up dead as the favor gets called in, with all too predictable results. It's biggest problem is that the big conspiracy just isn't that shocking and the manipulation considerably less convincing than, say, Warren Beatty inadvertently incriminating himself in The Parallax View or Robert Redford's everyman finding himself collateral damage in a covert CIA war game played with real bullets in Three Days of the Condor. Instead it's the early prison scenes that tend to play the best in a film that's always perfectly watchable but always perfectly predictable. The weakest link is the relationship between Hackman and Candice Bergen (saddled with a terrible hairstyle), who never seem to connect or convince as two people in love, though Rooney, Widmark and Eli Wallach all do good work in the supporting ranks.

For the record, that insane opening rant in full: ""Do you believe you decided to come to this theatre today? That it was your own idea? Of your own.. free will? Whether we know it or not, we're all manipulated. It's getting almost impossible to think or even act for ourselves anymore. We're manipulated. Programmed. Brainwashed. Right from the start. Right from the day we're born. By family, by press, by radio, by television. And more and more we know less and less of who THEY are. Who could they be? Is it the boss we work for? Who tells him what to do? Is it the government? Whoever's in power, it seems just the same. So, who's behind THEM? It's reached a point when they could take an ordinary man and so manipulate him that they could get him to kill the most important person in the world. Like the hero of a book written by Franz Kafka fifty years ago, we feel ourselves powerless, unable to control anymore what really happens to us. Perhaps we're all the victim of some appalling conspiracy. What authority could they represent? Listen to me. I want you to watch what happened to this ordinary man. He lived in a country with a legal constitution. All the laws were in force. Like many of his generation he was sent to fight in Vietnam. He survived, fell in love, got into trouble, wound up in jail. Then THEY really started to work on him. He fell victim to what they call the Domino Principle. The irresistible force of chain reaction...""
