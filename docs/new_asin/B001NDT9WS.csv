8323678,5,B001NDT9WS,"A well told story of a true incident. Typical for most British productions post WWII regarding military actions, it is done very authentically. I unfortunately had to order it from the UK so I can only watch it on my computer but it was worth it. Richard Todd(who was a paratrooper in WWII) turned in his usual excellent performance.",1501545600,,333,4.661016949152542
8323679,5,B001NDT9WS,"The Yangtse Incident is a very well done movie. From various sources I used to research the actual incident, the movie follows pretty close to the real event which is almost a rarity in movies as they try to spice them up with much more action. There was an additional battle scene added at the end which didn't take place but it does add to the overall impact of the movie itself.

Richard Todd was fantastic in the starring role. William Hartnell's performance was also extremely good.

I purchased this movie primarily to see something that William Hartnell was in prior to becoming the first Doctor Who just to see how he was in other things. I was pleasantly surprised by his performance as well as the strong story itself.

As an added touch of realism in the movie, they literally dragged the H.M.S. Amethyst out of mothballs to star as herself. The H.M.S. Magpie doubled for her in scenes where the ship was in motion due to the Amethyst's engines not being operational. Sadly it showed on screen that the Amethyst hadn't seen service in awhile with worn, chipped and faded paint being very noticeable. It looked more realistic after the first battle scene but scenes prior to the first battle betrayed the fact that she hadn't seen service in quite awhile but it didn't take anything away from the story itself.

This is an excellent addition for any classic or war movie fan.",1474243200,3,1385,4.640816326530612

8323681,3,B001NDT9WS,First half was okay but then the second half seemed to be a lot of stock footage. Possibly real footage but it just wasn't that interesting when it should have been the highlight of the show.,1427846400,,191,4.333333333333333
