1037441,3,6305475067,The video was not so bad.  I have already seen it all on ET and other programs on TV.  But if you want to understand more you should watch it.  I think you can rent it.  I learned a litte from the film and I did know a  lot before seeing it.,937785600,,241,3.5576923076923075

7890315,3,6305475067,"I am a huge Star Wars fan, I grew up on these movies; and I still love them to this day. I bought this because I thought it was going to go more behind the scenes of the three movies, especially Empire Strikes Back. I was surprised it didn't, I saw a documentary on T.V. talking about ESB, and thought this was it. It wasn't, I do have Empire of Dreams/From Star Wars To Jedi; but I am still looking for that one I caught on T.V.. This is still a good documentary but it falls short compared to the others. If you are a huge fan of the Star Wars saga you should get it; but it isn't a must have.",1441065600,,595,3.8852459016393444
7890316,5,6305475067,"I really liked this video. I liked the part when Mark Hamill does an impression of Harrison Ford while talking about shooting the last scene in  Star Wars. Jeremy Bulloch talkes about shooting a scene in The Empire  Strikes Back when he said the wrong line:""Put Captain Cargo in the  Solo hold!"" instead of ""Put Captain Solo in the Cargo Hold!""  Mark Hamill mentions that Lucas once asked him to play an Obi-Wan type  character in an Episode VII passing on the excalibur down to the next  generation and that he said that it would come out arouind 2011. David  Prowse mentions that he may don the Darth Vader costume again in Episode  III. Nevetheless this is a fascinating video that also tells what went on  during the making of Star Wars.",966124800,5,741,4.553030303030303
7890317,1,6305475067,"The problem with this video is that it's just loose interviews strung together without any thought behind it. The info is nothing new, and they don't show any cool behind the scenes stuff. Hard to believe, but they  actually found a way to make Star Wars boring.",963360000,4,262,4.574468085106383
7890318,1,6305475067,It was cool seeing how Chewbacca looks like but thats about it. It really stinks.,949363200,3,81,4.466666666666667
7890319,1,6305475067,"Unfortunately I bought a copy of this tape last November hoping for that for an un-authorised version something new and different,I am a SW fan but found the interview's repititious and overall, not of much interest as a  hole,I also have the original 1977 The Making of Star Wars,far more  entertaining though I understand most-likely un-obtainable now,in my opnion  rent the Unauthorised version first before buying and decide for yourself.  Just because your'e a fan doesn't mean you have to like everything put out  there connected to the Star Wars franchise, it is boring and a  disappointment,buyer's beware in future I will view/rent first before  purchasing!",945043200,16,666,5.226415094339623
7890320,3,6305475067,"Well, I knew not to expect a whole lot from this when they got two characters names wrong (Bobba Fett and Biggs Starflyer), but then I guess that is what to expect from something completely unauthorized.  I would  even go as far as to say that I believe that some of their information was  false.
All that aside, if you are a Star Wars fan, check it out, as there  are some good clips of Daniels, Baker, and Mayhew.  Otherwise skip it.",944611200,4,435,4.2560975609756095
7890321,4,6305475067,"Being a true Star Wars fan, I bought this on a whim. And a whim is pretty much what this video is. If you go in with no expectations, like I did, you will probably enjoy it--especially if you are a Star Wars fan. If you  aren't, don't buy it... it really doesn't have much to interest non-fans.  There was a lot of talking, fascinating to me and others like me, but  brain-cell killing for those unlike me. Are you a right-brain or left-brain  person? Think carefully before buying.",943228800,11,482,4.382022471910112
7890322,5,6305475067,"The only thing that bothers me is that they have Ewan McGregor, Sir Alec Guiness, and Liam Neeson's pictures on the back, and they are nowhere on this video. However, there are interviews with people whom you don't  usually hear from like Jeremy Bulloch, Bib Fortuna, Kenny Baker and Peter  Mayhew. While watching the show I realised that the background was blurred  to hide the Star Wars posters behind them. All in all, I thought it was  very insightful, and not neccessarily flattering of George Lucas at times.  It's nice to see the other side of the coin, but George is still a genious.",941500800,8,591,4.644230769230769
