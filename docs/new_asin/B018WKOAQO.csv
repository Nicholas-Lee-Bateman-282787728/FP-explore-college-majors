The story follows 5 sisters, so you get the varied reactions to constraints imposed by archaic traditions. The opening image is rewarded by an excellent final image.

7559164,3,B018WKOAQO,"Saw it in a theater in the framework of a Good Film Club. Five orphaned sisters are brought up by their grandmother and her grown-up son in a Turkish village. Their innocent frolicking with boys on the seashore sparks a wave of malicious gossip and outrage in the tight-knit backward and devoutly Muslim environment. The grandmother, on her own and also coerced by her violent and prejudiced son, decides to lock up the girls and, instead of sending them back to school, teach them homemakers duties and marry them off as quickly as possible in traditional way that requires no consent from the future bride. That's the starting point. The movie follows the ways the girls try to cope with the situation, especially the youngest Leila, a born rebel. On the whole, a disappointment. The movie is a social protest against the wave of Islam and backwardness sweeping Turkey (but not only Turkey). Some facts seem hardly believable. The family can bring a married young woman to an emergency room at the hospital to check her virginity, and the doctors lamely comply! However, the movie does not hold enough emotional impact to make it a believable drama. The comic relief situations are mostly jarring and the impact is poor. The movie ends lamely indeed. Some very nice shots of the girls playing on the sea shore and at a soccer game, but not enough to make it a real eye- and conscience-catcher, and definitely not a memorable cinematographic experience. BTW, why only French subtitles?",1449532800,,1486,4.854330708661418

7559167,4,B018WKOAQO,"Mustang is a Turkish movie inspired by Sofia Coppola's Virgin Suicides. It takes place in a remote village in Turkey and follows the story of five sisters whose very conservative family slowly takes away all forms of 'perversion' away from them in order to make them 'suitable wives'.

The movie doesn't beat you over the head with its feminist message but lets the drama unfold naturally. The tone is surprisingly sweet and even funny in places for a movie with such a subject matter. First time director Deniz Gamze Ergven has a strong grip on tone; she never allows the movie to become too gritty for its own good. The girls are not defined by the plot like it's often the case with this type of movies; they have moments of laughs and happiness which never undermine the seriousness of the subject matter.

The performances from the lead actresses are phenomenal. The youngest girl blew me away - not once do you feel like she's acting. Their performances is what make them so distinctive from each other and not just stand-ins for Oppressed Muslim Girls TM like it's often the case.

Mustang is easily one of the best feminist movies of the year, proudly sitting next to The Diary of a Teenage Girl. It's sincere and heartfelt, it's not preachy but honest and it shows great premise for the future of its director.",1497225600,3,1319,4.652360515021459

7559178,5,B018WKOAQO,One of the saddest movies I have seen regarding the abusive behavior toward woman in the Middle East.  It is tragic to see four young girls damaged by the need for men to control their lives.  It was like watching a Bird of Paradise wither and die.

7559180,5,B018WKOAQO,"Mustang is an incredible film. It's emotionally exhausting, beautiful and very unique in its subject. I'm sure many other people writing about this film are simply going to say that it's a feminist film, but we need to move past labeling any film about women who aren't subservient or ""typical"" as advocation and instead let the story breathe. This film isn't about an ideology -- one that is important and one that I personally believe in very strongly -- but it's about struggle and hardship shown through a child's view. Each young woman is imprisoned by extreme conservatism while they wait to be married off. The story itself is very simple but what director Deniz Gamze Erguven shows us hits incredibly hard. And even as an American woman with parents who never treated me poorly for simply being a woman, there is a strange ease in relating the film to that which you feel yourself. Our lives are different and so is our culture, but Mustang brings the frustrations of being a young woman into an incredibly visceral experience. This makes it difficult to fully review this film beyond my emotions. But I will say this: each performance from the five girls were incredible. Each had their own personality and I was amazed at was Erguven was able to bring out of them. This trend of arthouse-realism (in particular the style reminds me of Martha Marcy May Marlene) works so well within this incredibly naturalistic film. The editing and pacing feels akin to Boyhood, but of course it takes place in a much shorter span of time -- everything flows, time passes and you don't really notice, it's not so much scenes as it is fleeting moments that build up to create whole people and their struggles.

The best part about Mustang is that its perspective is entirely female, which is so refreshing, and it isn't about the tragedy of womanhood. Instead, Mustang is the story of the resilience of womanhood. Mustang is powerful and beautiful; Mustang is chilling and frustrating; Mustang is the real world for people, but I don't think Mustang is tragedy. Womanhood isn't tragedy, it's overcoming it.",1473292800,6,2099,4.814404432132964

7559184,5,B018WKOAQO,"Five sisters have lost both parents and have been brought up in their uncle Erols house ostensibly by their Grandmother. They live in a coastal idyll but where orthodox views on propriety hold sway. Women should know their place and chastity is a virtue to be honoured.

Then after school one day they play with some boys from their school at the beach and tongues start wagging. This is not idle gossip though as the neighbours impress on the family that the girls have gone too far and need to be controlled. This they take to with gusto turning the house into a marriage factory and curbing all the girls freedoms. The youngest is Lale and she is very free spiorited and so she determines to be who she wants to be and not conform to the stereotype that is demanded of her  this is their story.

Now I thought I would not be that impressed about the story of five sisters who are not allowed to get their own way (yes that is a very narrow view of this film) but instead I found it captivating and engrossing. This is a story anyone can identify with who has ever been subjugated to the will and of others and who have had to fight to be just themselves.

7559187,5,B018WKOAQO,"I recently caught this movie on Netflix and have not been able to stop thinking about it since. This was 100 times better than the Hollywood, mainstream Oscar picks of 2016. It's a beautiful narrative of 5  ""wild"" Turkish sisters, trapped in an outdated, conservative, Muslim household and forced into arranged marriages before they've completed school. I think the movie highlights the struggles women face as they try to crave out their own paths while ""falling in line"" with societal expectations. The movie makes a good case for how important choices are, especially when they are as serious as a coerced marriage. This is the director's first major movie but she'll have a long career if her future projects garner as many accolades as this film. This movie got a lot of international awards and even secured an Oscar nomination. As for the 5 actresses portraying the sisters, I was blown away with their talent, especially when I read 4 of the girls were not professionals and had no acting experience prior to this movie. Their chemistry really made me feel as though I were watching real life sisters and were along for their journey.

7559198,4,B018WKOAQO,"Possible spoilers.  This Oscar nominee for best foreign language film was the work of first time director Deniz Gamze Erguven.  Born in Turkey but partially raised in France, she co-wrote the film with Alice Winocour.  Certainly there is an element of been-there-done-that in the story.  Set in rural Turkey, the film focuses on 5 orphaned sisters who are now living with their grandmother and her son, the girls uncle.

The film opens joyously, with school out for the summer, as the girls who range in age from about 11 to 16, and some of the male classmates decide to go swimming (yes, fully clothed) in the sea.  Horse-fighting, the girls are sitting on the shoulders of the boys.  Later they are caught in an orchard eating apples by the landowner with a shotgun.  When they get home, their grandmother begins spanking the girls, not because of the apples but because some busybody saw them rubbing their privates on the boys neck.  The uncle accuses his mother of allowing the girls to do what they want.  As a result everything is taken away from the girls including phones, computers, magazines, TV and just about anything that can be a lure to depravity.  Hell, the girls are even paraded to the local clinic for a virginity exam.

The grandmother and the uncle decide it is time to prep the girls for marriage, so they are instructed by various aunts and cousins on the fine art of being a wife.  Sure enough, the older girls are essentially auctioned off to the parents of young unmarried men.  In the case of the oldest girl, this is fine as they are already romantically entangled, although she is technically a virgin.  A disturbing feature of this culture is that no wedding is complete until the new hubby can produce a blood-stained sheet.  Good grief!  The next oldest girl wants none of the guy shes betrothed to but has no choice.  The third girls potential marriage results in tragedy.  The youngest girl, and the films narrator as an adult, is also the most inventive and reluctant to be part of this baneful custom.

While the film has these dark elements including a suggestion of sexual abuse, for the most part it is also genuinely humorous and refreshing.  Clearly the sisters love each other and have an unbreakable bond.  This makes the removal of the girls by marriage that much more insufferable by the younger ones.  In one of the better scenes, the girls sneak out to a national soccer game.  All men have been excluded because of a riot in an earlier match.  So only women are admitted.  When one of the girls aunts sees them on the telly, she gathers the rest of the women in the village to knock out the electricity so that the men don't become violent seeing the girls at the match.

The film works ultimately because of the feel of authenticity and the wonderful chemistry between the actors who play the girls.  Recommended.",1465862400,8,2863,4.649402390438247

7559216,5,B018WKOAQO,"The Bluray version will not be released for another 2 weeks but I was provided with an advance screening copy in order to provide an objective review. I think this may be different than other reviews already posted.

Before I begin, I will point out that you will NOT find any plot spoilers here. Personally, I dislike reviews that are lengthy and provide TMI (too much info) and Ill try to avoid that. I watched this film knowing nothing but that this was a Nominee for Best Foreign Film Oscar 2016. That was enough for me. The film is the first feature length film by a female director who was born on Ankara but has lived mostly in France! The firm is in Turkish with easy to read English subtitles.

This is a story of five teenage or young adult sisters, some of who are reaching puberty. But their family  and Turkish tradition  has arranged marriage planned for them. What ensures over the 94 minute running time is how the girls do (or don't find) their freedom. Okay, thats enough about the plot. Enjoy it!

Now to the things no one else has discussed here yet. The Blu-ray comes in a package with both a BD and a separate DVD  both have same bonuses. These include the theatrical trailer plus am 18 minute short film that the director - Deniz Gamze Erguven made in 2006.  This film, which I saw a training film focuses on only one woman (older than the teens in Mustang) and her problems being a woman in a male dominated country. The woman in this film is actually the Director herself.

There are other goodies in the package too! Cohen Media Group has produced a nice 16 page booklet with a lengthy Q&A with Erguven that really adds to your enjoyment. (BUT, read it AFTER you have seen the film). And there is still more. For the first time, in my many years of reviewing DVDs, there is an included download card with the soundtrack from the film. Often these soundtracks cost almost as much buying the film. I sure hope they do that in future releases.

The rating on the package is so small that you probably won't be able to read it but the film is rated PG-13  for sexual situations and frank discussion of puberty. It also gives this rating because of  a rude gesture.  Id never seen this wording before. I don't think Im spoiling anything here but it just the showing of a middle finger so don't get too worried.

Well, there you have it. I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7559220,4,B018WKOAQO,"The title Mustang refers to the wild stallions indigenous to the region of Deniz Gamze Ergven's beautiful Cannes award-winner, but it could just as easily apply to the untamed spirit of the sisterhood at the story's heart. It's a film about sexual repression, rebellion, and siblinghood in a conservative Turkish society that views femininity as something to be locked away and kept from the world. While Ergven could have chosen to pursue the subject coldly from a distance, it's the harsh criticism he passes on such cultures that gives the film its powerful edge.

It's also that judgment which separates Mustang from Sofia Coppola's surreal The Virgin Suicides, which tells a very similar tale of confined female vitality. Lale (Gne Nezihe ensoy), Nur (Doa Zeynep Doulu), Ece (Elit Ican), Selma (Tuba Sungurolu), and Sonay (Ilayda Akdoan) are five orphaned sisters whose energy and spirit is frowned upon in their community where women are to be controlled. Something as simple as frolicking in the water with a group of boys is enough to warrant harsh penalties at home, meted about by their uncle who will stop at nothing to tame them. He insists the older girls have been sexually active, something that would make them impossible to be married off to the men of his choosing. So they're taken to get virginity tests despite their cries of innocence.

But that is just the start of the indignities forced upon these vibrant siblings. Everything from their clothing to their diet to the amount of time they are allowed outdoors is restricted; bars on the windows and doors give the appropriate sense of imprisonment. Naturally, this inspires rebellion, mostly within Lale, the youngest of the sisters. Largely through her funny and stubborn perspective we see what happens to her older siblings. Their bond is forcibly ripped apart as each is married off to one guy or another, turning the home into a ""wife factory"" as Lale puts it. But she doesn't want that fate for herself, and acts out in any way she can. Some of her exploits are comical, like a risky escape to catch a soccer match which, through familial subterfuge, ends with the entire town losing electricity.  Other things we experience through Lale's eyes aren't so fun, as not all of her sisters are equipped to handle life's burdens the same way.

Some may take issue with Ergven and co-writer Alice Winocour for not scouring deeper into why such cultures are able to persist, or better yet why individual families would seek to suppress the spirits of those they love. There are characters in the story who love the girls and yet enable their harsh treatment, and very little attempt is made to explain those decisions. But that also would have made for a very different film than the one we are treated to, one that allows the engaging performances of its cast to take bloom. There's an intimacy between all of the young actresses that comes through naturally, ebbing and flowing like all sibling relationships do.  In a year that has seen a number of great performances by young stars, this film can boast that it is full of them. Mustang could have been relentlessly grim but Ergven finds just as many joys to go along with the pains of fighting for female independence.",1455667200,,3245,4.83963963963964
7559221,5,B018WKOAQO,"Directed by Deniz Gamze Ergven (this is her first film) from a screenplay by Ergven and Alice Winocour (Augustine), Mustang is a highly engaging and intimate film about five young sisters coming up against the cultural restrictions imposed by tradition on women in conservative rural Turkey, as seen through the eyes of - and narrated by - the youngest of the sisters, Lale.

In a small coastal town in rural Turkey, five young girls, sisters who were orphaned some years back, live with their grandmother and extended family. The film begins with the youngest sister, Lale (winningly played by Gne' 'ensoy), at school saying an emotional goodbye to her much loved female teacher Dilek (Bahar Kerimoglu) who is moving to Istanbul, the capital. Dilek gives her a piece of paper with her address in Istanbul, telling Lale to write now and then. As the girls walk home from school, they pause at the beach to play with some of the boys from their class, engaging in an innocent game of ""horse"" where the girls ride on the shoulders of the boys and try to push each other off.  This seemingly innocuous event, however, has consequences, for when the girls reach home they are confronted by their grandmother (Nihal G. Koldas) who is outraged by their ""scandalous"" behavior, having been informed of it by a neighbor.  Their oppressive uncle Erol (Ayberk Pekcan) is even more outraged and proceeds to pull the girls from school and keep them at home under ever increasing restrictions until the house ultimately becomes their prison. The family proceeds to take away all ""corrupting influences"", which includes everything from their cell-phones and music to their schoolbooks and computer.

One of the things I liked was the way the script didn't reduce the characters to caricatures. The grandmother and the aunts mean well, trying in their traditional way to prepare the girls for what they believe a woman's role in life is, eagerly teaching them what they know about sewing, cooking, manners and such. And they're not unsympathetic. At one point one aunt, knowing how the girls have been cut off from their usual treats, shows Lale how to make Turkish chewing gum, which, to Lale's surprise, she actually finds she likes.  And there are hints in the things the grandmother says that show she's not blind to what the girls are experiencing and is doing her best to prepare and at times protect them.

But the girls are still resistant, even though each act of resistance ends up with their lives becoming even more restricted, culminating in the grandmother's decision to find them husbands as quickly as possible.

Highly, highly recommended.",1454457600,6,2640,4.9324324324324325
7559222,5,B018WKOAQO,"What a movie! Told from the perspective of a 12-year-old girl, five orphan sisters see their lives change as a cloud of conservatism descends on their village, enforced, in their own home, by their creepy uncle. As schooling slips from their grasp, and a future of forced marriages looms closer, they make a desperate bid for a better life. Overall, it's a heartwarming film. There is some discussion of sex and virginity, it might be interesting to young people in their mid-teens.",1454198400,4,482,4.890243902439025

Mustang was directed and co-written by Turkish born Deniz Gamze Ergven, who actually grew up in France. The official film organization in Turkey refused to submit Mustang for Oscar consideration so France ended up submitting it to the Academy and it's now been nominated for Best Foreign Language Film. A multitude of film pundits have praised the film no end but have any of them asked how true is Ergven's story? A casual perusal of the majority of posts on IMDb by Turkish natives maintain that Ergven's view of the way things are in Turkey as depicted in the film, is inaccurate and superficial.

Mustang is set in nebolu, in northern Turkey, near the Black Sea. The story concern five sisters who live with their uncle and grandmother in a provincial, conservative town. When we first meet them, the youngest sister, Lale, says goodbye to her teacher who is moving to Istanbul. Propped up on the shoulders of some of their fellow male students, they attempt to knock one another into the water, as they frolic in the ocean. Later word gets back to neighbors that they've been acting inappropriately with ""boys"" and they're first castigated by their grandmother and later physically abused by their uncle. Ultimately they're forbidden to leave the house and no longer allowed to attend school.

So at this juncture, what's wrong with this picture? As those posters from Turkey point out, the girls don't act like girls who are from the provincial Black Sea areathey're more like girls from an urban environment. Their accents (according to these posters) don't sound right either. Others on the internet liken the girls to the characters in Sophia Coppola's ""The Virgin Suicides"" and their behavior seemed to me more akin to frat girls in the cheap American exploitation flick, ""Girls Gone Wild."" Ergven is clearly the outsider looking in and can only imagine what provincial girls in that part of the world are really like. Most teenage girls have a rebellious streak but would they act out in the manner depicted hereespecially when they are growing up in an abusive home? I think not.

What also doesn't ring true is that girls were never reigned in by the grandmother and the abusive uncle when they were very young. They show no fear of retaliation as everything is one big jokebut in a conservative, patriarchal society, one is taught to fear retribution. Therefore, their rebellion would probably take a much more subtle form and they would not be allowed to act out in the way that is depicted here.

As the plot progresses, we realize that Ergven's approach to character is didactic. The grandmother is also a victim of male perfidy as the uncle holds her responsible for the girls being spoiled. The grandmother's affinity for the arranged marriages is clearly a response to her perception that the uncle is sexually abusing his niecesmarrying them off is her way of protecting them. At the same time, she's intimidated by the uncle, who is basically a cardboard villain in the storyline.

I have no doubt bad things happen to women all over the world and especially in places where sexuality is viewed as something dirty. Ergven knows about arranged marriages and wisely shows the conflicting attitudes of the first two sisters who are married off (one is ecstatic since she's matched up with her current lover; the other is sullen as she has nothing in common with a husband to be who is a virtual stranger). Still, I would have liked to have known a little bit more about the grooms and the family members. We see them at a distance and one gets the feeling that Ms. Ergven doesn't know these people hardly at all. She's been quoted as saying that Mustang is a ""fairy tale""but it's clear her story is one of ""us vs. them""agitprop for those who simply want to be on the winning side of a very complex cultural problem.

As for the rest of MustangI say spare me the ""feel good"" histrionics. It all comes down to a most improbable escape on the part of the two younger sisters after another one of them commits suicide. Yes maybe something like that happened on one or two occasions in real life, but I would still say, ""not likely."" Next time ditch the super villain of an uncle, scratch the suicide and show us the sisters as normal teenagers living in a culture which they feel part of but also yearn to have more opportunities in a society filled with less oppression.",1453248000,2,4428,4.735408560311284
7559224,4,B018WKOAQO,"""Mustang"" (2015 release from Turkey and France; 97 min.) brings the story of five sisters. As the movie opens, we see them saying goodbye to a teacher who is moving to Istanbul, 1,000 km. away. On the way the girls are horsing around in the ocean with some boys, and when they get home, their grandma has already heard about it and is infuriated, as is later their uncle ( we learn the girls' parents perished 10 years ago). Grandma and Uncle Erol have only one thing in mind: to keep the girls 'pure' and away from anything that might tempt them in any way. The girls, on the other hand, simply want to play and have fun and be the teenagers they feel they are. What will happen to the girls? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the feature-length directing debut of Turkish actress Deniz Gamze Ergven, who also co-wrote the screenplay. And what a memorable debut it is! She lets the scenes unfold, and slowly you the viewer are beginning to understand where this is leading to. The stifling and suffocating morality and family environment within which the girls need to live will leave you bewildered, yet it is sadly the reality for millions and millions of girls growing up in a conservative religious environment (and not just Muslim). Along the way the five sisters will steal your heart, while the ""mustang"" in each of the girls must be tamed!  The movie's overall atmosphere made me think of Sofia Coppola's ""The Virgin Suicides"", even if ""Mustang's ending is nothing like it. The acting performances are superb throughout, in particular from the young lady who plays Lale (the youngest sister, and the movie's emotional lynch-pin). I found myself emotionally invested in this movie from start to finish. It is not a surprise then that this was just nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Movie, as it is a fantastic movie, period (although I still am quite certain that ""Son of Saul"" will win that Oscar category). Last but not least, there is a wonderful musical score for this movie, composed by Warren Ellis (and yes, there are also a couple of Warren Ellis & Nick Cave tunes in it).

The movie opened this past weekend on a single screen in Ft. Myers, and the early evening weeknight screening where I saw this at was attended quite nicely, much to my delight. If you love a top notch foreign movie, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Mustang"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1453248000,11,2492,4.633484162895928

8743202,3,B018WKOAQO,"It's a bit mystifying how this wound up with an Oscar nomination. This is a well-made film, but its story feels more like required reading than an entertaining film. The film presents its 5 leads, all sisters, as girls with a slight wild streak in the face of a family which appears to value them more like cattle than humans. Like a Turkish ""Virgin Suicides,"" the elders of the family attempt to lock up their girls after they engage in mostly harmless horseplay with boys from the village after the school year ends. Religious mania fills the air as the girls are forced to dress demurely and married off to boys they've never met. It would be medievel if the story didn't take place in the here and now.

This is one of those films where no one has any shade of grey, no pun intended. Here, you're either a villain or a victim. There's a semi-intriguing commentary about Turkish men involving women and soccer, but other than that, the film feels like a dirge. It even warns you that the girls will never be together again. If you find that entertaining, rent it. I expected more but was disappointed.",1518652800,2,1104,4.52
