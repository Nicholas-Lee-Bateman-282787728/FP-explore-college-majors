8678510,5,B00NJ12QIG,"Very well-made DVD; automatically subtitled; interesting information obtained through channeling; not for skeptics; many stories, factual/fictitious about the true Christian Templar Knights are miss-mash because they wisely did not put in writing, their secret mission of protecting their obtained secrets/knowledge (of building/architecture and the mystical arts) for the future; they protected many pilgrims and people in general, they fought against the dark forces to keep them at bay. Even when tortured to death, by the ruthless Inquisition ( the Church in collusion with the State, meaning the King of France), they never revealed what they discovered - treasures of great knowledge & wealth & power. They hid clues in plain sight, for the future when the time would come, clues in Catholic cathedrals that they built in 40 years (incredibly short time with advanced knowledge), most of them in France; clues that could only be unraveled with a key code; they were careful about selecting their knights, and had a very strict life and death method for keeping their secrets intact, hidden from the dark forces and those whose worked for them. Always the true champions of the light forces against evil during a time when there were no true justice for all, especially the common people.",1501027200,,1293,5.251207729468599
