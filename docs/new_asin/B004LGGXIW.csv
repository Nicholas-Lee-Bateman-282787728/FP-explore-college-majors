I had hoped it was something that would capture the attention of my two dachshunds when I have to leave the house. The video had a large portion on kittens/cats, if you are into that...",1419984000,,256,4.03921568627451

8434345,5,B004LGGXIW,"This is an animal version of America's funniest videos.  The DVD has four parts:

1) American's Cutest Dog 2010
2) America's Cutest Dog 2009
3) America's Cutest Cat
4) World's Ugliest Dog Competition
