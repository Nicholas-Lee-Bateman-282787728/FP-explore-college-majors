8716182,2,B00XKJFSBO,"Coulda, shoulda been so much better. Feel like Silver just kinda slapped this one together very haphazrd. Timing's everything cause not long ago this kind of film wouldn't even been able to garner a c level regional film fest screening. Hacks like Swanberg, Duplass bro, et al have polluted the Indie scene so much w/ mediocrity that this nerd cool thing is all the rage...",1520294400,,373,4.753846153846154

8716186,1,B00XKJFSBO,"This has to be one of the stupidest, most senseless movies I have seen in a long time.  Unless you like watching pregnant young girls talk trash and take long meandering walks in the woods, skip it.  The so called love interest made no sense-I didn't care about one single person in this horrible movie.  I kept watching out of sheer hope that there would be something about it that would be redeeming but alas, there wasn't.  I will say the lead guy was good looking, but that doesn't make a movie.",1449964800,3,499,4.391304347826087
8716187,5,B00XKJFSBO,"This is a terrific independent movie where humor comes from sloppiness of human behavior. Nathan Silver directs with a loose, go with the flow, style reminiscent of John Cassavetes. The setting is a private home for pregnant teenagers. The adult son of the woman who runs it comes to find peace from his marriage that is falling apart. The raging estrogen of the soon-to-be mothers can't help but react to the new male. Off-kilter tense scenes follow where outbursts of emotion lead to humorous situations and arguments. The director's mother, Cindy Silver, is memorable as the woman who runs the house. The movie is never pessimistic but definitely realistic with how people behave. Coming in at a brief 75 minutes (IMDb referenced) the movie does not outstay its welcome, one of the seemingly few examples these days where a director took it to heart that brevity is the soul of wit.

I originally saw this at a film festival. During the short time it played in a theater the next year, I moved fast to see it again. Highly recommended for those looking for something off the beaten path.",1449619200,,1090,4.767195767195767
8716188,5,B00XKJFSBO,"This was a great indie film by a very talented  up-and-coming director Nathan Silver. If you enjoy movies made with the heart and soul of the writer, director, cast & crew involved, that are different than the main stream features that big movie companies shove down your throats... Then you will enjoy this one.",1447459200,2,312,4.777777777777778
8716189,1,B00XKJFSBO,This was one of the dumbest movies I've ever wasted my time watching. This is one time I wish there was a way to request a refund on a movie rental. It just ended abruptly and storyline really didn't go anywhere.,1437609600,3,212,4.195121951219512
