In a most concise and photographically exciting format, ten years of dreadnought development, and 4 years of World War 1, usher in many breakthroughs in what had become the naval arms race.

The film opens with the launching of HMS Dreadnought. Dreadnought delivered an enormous advantage to the English fleet in 1906, while simultaneously rendering all existing battle fleets [including England's] obsolete which supercharged the already heated naval arms race that preceded the World War 1.

Naval actions and strategies of the period are examined and explained by experts, including well known naval historian, Norman Friedman. Dogger Bank, Jutland, Heligoland Bight and Gallipoli are seen from the perspective of the Battleships and crews of England and Germany.
