7992434,2,B00009P1LT,"Originally filmed for the TNT Network, FRAMED is a mishmash of poor plot development and lackluster performances.  Rob Lowe plays a ""perfect cop"", but one with a past that deals with bribery and demotion.  He is given a second chance when he is appointed to interrogate a criminal mastermind who is now in the witness protection program.  Under the pedestrian direction of Daniel Petrie Jr. (Beverly Hills Cop, Big Easy), the cast muddles along through a confusing plot scenario, where the intention seems to be to have us asking, ""Who's cheating who?"".  Unfortunately, Rob Lowe as the cop delivers a one-dimensional portrait and Sam Neill seems to be trying to be a James Mason clone in his intentionally smooth con man.  Add Alicia Coppola as Lowe's neglected wife who decides to have an affair with a US Marshal assigned to protect her, and Neill's two ""wives"" who are also lesbians and engage in some offside sex with Lowe, and you have the ingredients in this rather boring entry.  There's not a lot of action and it's handled so sloppily, it can't make up for the movie's dull pace.",1111104000,6,1088,4.76063829787234

Rob Lowe and Sam Neil make an excellent combination. Both characters are likeable and you never know who is telling the truth. Great fun and worth watching.",1072569600,10,224,4.625
