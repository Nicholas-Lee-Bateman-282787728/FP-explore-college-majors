But if you want to see the modern firefighter in action, take a look at ""Ricky's Rib Shack, a Firefighter's Journey""  You'll be amazed by the reality!",1238803200,,301,4.622641509433962
8186079,5,B00078MHPQ,"Firemen films are something you either like or don't like. Personally I like the drama of seeing real guys fight a fire and that's what I saw on this disk.

I liked the scenes where you can see the firemen take down the really big fires. Their equipment is so antique that I got very tense and worried that there would be no way possible to take the fire out.

When they do, I practically applauded in my seat.

What you should be aware of is that this is seriously vintage footage - so don't expect Hollywood cinematography.

Instead just sit back and check out the flames.",1146096000,,574,4.336448598130841
