8012907,2,B0001HMAPU,"INVISIBLE follows the events of MANDROID, where Benjamin Knight has been turned into an invisible man after battling the evil Drago. Drago seeks to uncover the secret behind Ben's new powers, so he kidnaps Ben's beautiful assistant Zanna in order to force him out of hiding. Now, it is up to Ben and the Mandroid unit to stop Drago once and for all! Full Moon puts their own spin on The Invisible Man, with a surprising amount of success. Although the film is frequently weighed down by the eccentric villain's half-baked plot and the endless amount of filler material, the special effects are impressive for the scale, and potential that the invisible character represents is fully explored through a number of unique and interesting techniques that exceed the film's budgetary limitations. With sword fights, gun battles, and invisible espionage, director Jack Ersgard packs in as much action as possible to make up for the loose plotting and weak character development. INVISIBLE is mindless entertainment at best, but it will find its place amongst low-budget SciFi fans.
