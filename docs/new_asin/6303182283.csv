I wish I could get it on dvd or she would put out an updated version that is just as 'dancey' and high impact.",1396828800,,318,4.015873015873016
7840266,3,6303182283,"I REMEMBER USING HER TAPES A LONG TIME AGO AND NEVER CAME ACROSS THIS ONE.  IT'S TOO DANCY FOR ME.  IT LOOKS LIKE IF I COULD DO IT, IT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE.",1321660800,,154,3.78125
7840267,4,6303182283,"Victoria Johnson is a great dance teacher. You get caught up in her enjoyment of dancing, she's encouraging to use modifications she always shows. She knows the most fun way to learn that's the least scary. She always keeps you moving by breaking down dance moves to it's rudimentary core simple steps, then adds to it like a more hop or turn of the knee or hip & then adds the arm movements. She also goes 1/2 speed, not 1/4 speed that some do which is soo slow you forget what you are doing... but 1/2 speed so you can get the feel right & still keep moving. This way, you are always moving, having fun, can practice & it is very easy to follow & do. I wish all dance workouts & even any instructional were all like that. It's much more fun & easier to learn then standing there watching & then mimicking that complex move after.
This is probably set in the early 90s, I can tell by fashion/makeup. They are still using headbands, but 80s was about color, 90s was about BLACK & they are all in black. Also ther is plenty of computer graphics which wasn't available in early 80s for some low-budget exercise tape. There are 3 backup dancers who are as enthusiastic & having real fun like Victoria, and behind them is a DJ spinning LPs of basic beat (uugghh) part of the time only & real song hits from the 90s which makes you really want to move.
Some of the moves are simple grapevines, plies up/down, she shows the running man, 2 variations of Roger Rabbit, some box steps, chasses (double steps) one that kinda uses jumping jacks, kicking back/slight turns, etc.
This will get your heart rate up.
I took off 1 star for camera sometimes zoomed in when showing a new move, but they zoom back out quickly, and this is only 30 min though this is from her 90 minute Technifunk 2000.",1197590400,,1781,4.335329341317365
