8177381,5,B000NDIAY2,"This is a fascinating film on the .history of Market Street, for true lovers of San Francisco,  for history buffs and San Francisco tour guides.  The camera shoots in real time as it rolls down Market St. in 1905 or 1906 (starting from the Castro?)  before the earthquake, and then a second time, same view, same timing, in the 21st century.  Possibility of also viewing on split screen, comparing the two versions in synchronized  timing.

2 other shorter films of Market St., one sad one just after the earthquake showing people walking in the aftermath,  are also included,  also with the possibility of viewing as a 4-way split screen, synchronized to views.  As they're shorter than the principal film, they join the split screen later, as they synchronize with the longer films' views.

This DVD also includes 2 other films of past events on Market St:  the Victory Day parade in 1945 and a parade for the San Francisco labor activist
Tom Mooney, along with various other short films (the making of,  bio, information on directors Melinda Stone and Sprague Anderson, and soundtrack by the Beth Custer ensemble, and shooting of the film's premire),

This is not for everyone, as it's not a tour guide on San Francisco,  but is wonderful, fascinating,  remarkable and well-made,  for true lovers of the City.

Thanks to the Exploratorium and other sponsors for this film.  And now, could you please release the film ""The Panama-Pacific Fair""?  I know of a copy at UQAM (Univrsit du Qubec  Montral).  This too is a unique and fascinating film.",1515888000,,1546,4.846743295019157
8177382,3,B000NDIAY2,"While I will always maintain that the original ""A Trip Down Market Street"" is a video treasure, in my opinion the rest of DVD content is of no value. That said the price was well worth adding this film to my collection... I just won't waste my time viewing the other films again. Two stars off just for the wasted time... otherwise five stars for the original film.",1347148800,,365,4.382352941176471
8177383,5,B000NDIAY2,I bought this video for myself a couple of months ago.  I liked it so much that I bought more copies to give to family and friends.  As before the items arrived promptly and in perfect condition.  I definitely would order from this company again.  Thanks for the wonderful experience.,1309824000,,284,4.62
