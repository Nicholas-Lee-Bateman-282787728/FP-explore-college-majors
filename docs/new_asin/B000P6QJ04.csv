8189249,1,B000P6QJ04,"The content of the DVD is ""Intermarket Analysis and Sector Rotation Related the Business Cycle"" and has nothing to do with High Probability Chart Reading!",1319760000,,154,5.2
8189250,1,B000P6QJ04,"I fortunately bought this DVD for less than $20 during a financial website's sale.  Unfortunately, it was still not worth the money.  The DVD description itself is highly misleading, as the only chart pattern mentioned is an ascending triangle and that's only in passing.  The DVD is exclusively about intermarket relationships and sadly has no insightful information there, either.  Anything to be learned from this DVD can be learned by doing a Google search on ""intermarket relationships gold bonds stocks"".  A disgrace that someone as esteemed as John Murphy is selling this weak content, and even more disgraceful that he is selling it at this price.",1198713600,11,655,5.1415094339622645
