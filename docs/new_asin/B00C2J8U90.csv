I didn't know until reading the other reviewer that MGM caught wind of it and shut him down. I even got a reply from Bill saying that he was fighting an uphill battle getting it on BR. Then nothing! Now it all makes sense thinking MGM gagged him from releasing a BR. Now I was able to find that Kino Lorber is releasing, ""Monster Dog"" (which happens to be held by MGM too). Species II, III, IV (also MGM) getting released. Praying that somehow ""Creature (aka Titan Find) might still get a BR someday. And believe me, the DVD print is absolutely gorgeous even for DVD, get a proper high def?, Wow!!!!

Update 2/17/2017: So this dvd has fallen off the radar now. Last time saw it was at ioffer (a dvd-r w/artwork scan of signed original sleeve) which I bought as a backup to my backup copy (I made for general watching use) of my originally bought dvd (which I never use, except for the copy I made.) If you really want this title you can still get it, heres the hitch, you end up buying, The killer sci fi 3 pack from SGL Entertainment. What youll get is 3 movies upscaled on blu ray, two are simply junk prints not worth having AT ALL. The surprise youll get (I even did a comparison to my original bought dvd) is Titan Find! After some screen shot comparisons it looks to me like a mirror print of my original dvd (pretty sure thats where they got it, how they legally put it out is unknown to me). So if you really want this movie in its gorgeous 2.35:1 print and missed out on the original dvd get the SGL blu ray. Youll hate the artwork cover, the disc menu & the other absolutely nasty movie prints, but youll LOVE your Titan Find (pun intended!) Im still holding out that Bill will get it out on on  properly HD blu ray, but until then this is the best print youll find.",1453075200,2,1998,4.200520833333333
8576561,5,B00C2J8U90,"Fun and cheesy space horror. Found a used one for 29.90 (!) a teal titan find considering the prices for this DVD as of now.
This is indeed in widescreen and uncut and if you can find it for a reasonable price I recommend it. It's actually fun in its own cheesy way. Acting? Not much but better than most with an imdb rating as low as this one.",1408406400,3,344,4.0
8576562,5,B00C2J8U90,"As another reviewer mentioned the director/ producer William Malone had every intention of releasing this version. He has the only known Panavision print of the film, and wanted the public to be able to enjoy seeing it in its original format. However, upon hearing of his intent to release the print in both standard def. and blu-ray, MGM stepped in claiming to own rights that they don't have, and squished his hopes of getting it out anytime soon. So don't blame the filmmaker for this seller's greed. Malone stated he'd love nothing more than for the public to have it! I highly recommend people contacting MGM and pushing them to work out a deal with Malone to have this released! The transfer on this looks excellent, even in Standard Def.!",1380585600,9,745,4.7384615384615385
8576563,1,B00C2J8U90,"this is not so much a ''review'' as it is more of a commentary. this particular dvd was supposedly ''released'' around 3/14/13. i say supposedly because it shows up on NO websites, has not been available for sale through legit retailers such as best buy or barnes & noble. i find it amazing that all of a sudden it opos up here on amazon for the ''cheap'' price of 'only' $199.99! from only 'one' seller no less. are you kidding me??? you wouldve thought the director william malone, after making such a big deal about 'finally' releasing a widescreen print of his beloved film, wouldve actually made it 'available' to the general buying public! as far as the 'seller' on here trying to foist it on some idiot for $199.99, you sir are a greedy sleazebag! yes, i said it! ridiculous!!!",1368144000,13,784,4.567375886524823
