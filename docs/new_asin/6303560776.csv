7849952,5,6303560776,"14 years ago I checked this from our local library. I'd rsrchd it after viewing with my then 1 yr old son who'd ridden a tractor at Colorado grandad's acreage. I learned how to draw all those veh's! We made a Lenny laminate printout, kept on our frig many years. It took serious web digging for me to learn the Lenny 'skinny', which made him all the more my hero! He and his bro produced the vid. He wisely insisted gearing it as a child vid, despite its draft intent for industry use...we often role played for our son the comedy of industry execs viewing this forestry cutting edge de/reforestation video and, as real industry prof'ls admitted openly admitted, tolerated Lenny's delightful camera winks and asides to youngsters viewing via library copies. His laminate is in my ofc supply lockup--forever! This, and two other bids top our boy+girl vid top 3: Mining For Gold (still out in stores and Amazon), and the season series on video of Newton's Apple tv science shows, long ago archived by PBS. After 4 yrs old, Zoboomofoo (by the still handsome+creative genius Kratt Bros) and Big Idea bids joined Reading Rainbow's LeVar, and Dudley Moore's Nat'l Geogr 'Spin' as vid faces. Beakman rounded out the serious learning with some of our most memorable hilarity for K-6 (or K-4).",1400716800,,1284,4.762331838565022
7849953,5,6303560776,"Exceptional educational video. Lenny the Lumberjack will educate and entertain your children for hours. Shows huge machines logging rugged terrain in northern British Columbia. Takes children through the entire  logging process. Shows harvesting, skidding, bucking, loading, trucking and  booming across the lake. Also explains all these terms:) Shows  reforestation of logged areas and explains why this is so important. If you  have a child who likes big machines or lumberjacks and logging, this video  will be an instant favourite. I have used this video for educational  purposes for children from 3 years to 10 years of age and found it to be  very valuable and well liked by all.",946512000,5,686,5.238532110091743
