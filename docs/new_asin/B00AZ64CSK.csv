5528944,4,B00AZ64CSK,"Of course this has nothing to do with J.R.R. Tolkien's Hobbit.  Be serious; it's an Asylum film.

If you love B-movies, then this is a good one.  Asylum movies may be improving over time.

* The Good:

The non-dubbed acting, the scenery, and the CGI are well-done.  The movie's pacing is comfortable.  The physical presence of the dubbed actors is impressive, especially since the main characters are Cambodian little people.  It's a fun film to watch.

* The Bad:

Sometimes the Asylum is its own worst enemy.  The movie was renamed ""Clash of the Empires"" after the Asylum was sued for using the word ""hobbits"".  And because it is an Asylum film, even the DVD cover art can not be trusted.",1390694400,3,690,4.6115702479338845

8559457,1,B00AZ64CSK,"In any Age, this is a terrible production (lawsuit notwithstanding, deeming it illegal for Asylum to ""steal"" someone else's brand name).  The story itself has absolutely nothing to do with Tolkien's creations, Asylum simply wanted to `trick' people into thinking this was in some way related to Tolkien's work.

The plot is undemanding; 'tree people' are kidnapped by the 'rock people' for use as labor until they are ready to eat them.  A rescue is mounted.  A battle of sorts ensues.  The end.

I can best describe this movie in one word: disorganized.  It is entirely populated with non-actors who can't act (plus one and a half actors who can: Christopher Judge and Bai Ling).  I literally cringed throughout this modest presentation; it was so painful to endure.  It is below bad, it is just plain awful.  The dialog is desperately hokey, made worse by stilted delivery.  It is just awkward in every regard save the creature development (obviously, this is where they spent all their money).  I can't imagine why they even bothered to release this travesty.  Surely they have some consideration where their suspect reputation is concerned.  There's schlock, which The Asylum is well known for and specializes in, and then there's just crap beyond all reckoning.  This is the latter, infinity.
Lame.  Lame.  Lame.",1411084800,2,1317,4.9953917050691246
8559458,1,B00AZ64CSK,"Also known by its post lawsuit title, Clash of the Empires, this movie gives credance to the thought, ""If you can't pronounce the actors' names, you'll likely not be watching a classic"".
Crappy CGI, pathethic dialogue and Cambodian midgets are the highlights of this deplorable movie.
I wonder if Cambodia had an excess of ""little people"" actors in need of jobs.",1406678400,2,362,4.950819672131147
