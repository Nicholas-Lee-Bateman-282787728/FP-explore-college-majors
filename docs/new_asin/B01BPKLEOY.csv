Andrews Blu-ray Review: IRON MAN [2008] The story will likely be familiar to any fan of the original Marvel comic. Tony Stark [Robert Downey Jr.] is the perfect embodiment of the Alpha Male. He's Bill Gates with pecs, blessed with a genius IQ, movie star good looks, and a Teflon coat of cockiness. He also happens to be an amoral (if legal) arms dealer, with his Stark Industries the world's leading supplier of weapons of mass destruction. As the film begins, Tony Stark is casual and cavalier and on his way to his latest weapons demo for the military that he treats with all the seriousness of the opening of a nightclub. Then real bombs are dropped, and Tony Stark is captured by a group of revolutionary terrorists. Pressed into service for his hi-tech skills, he plots his escape by turning himself into (in a mere few minutes of screen time) his own weapon of mass destruction and that is of course Iron Man.

For its first two-thirds, 'IRON MAN' works on just about every level. As social commentary, as an effects-filled adventure, as romance, and as a wholly entertaining comic book thrill ride. And that's largely thanks to Robert Downey Jr., he is terrific. Tony Stark's alcohol-fuelled party-boy persona is a perfect fit for the actor (it's now impossible to imagine anyone better suited for the role), and his natural humour makes even the most implausible aspects of the character and story strangely believable. Let's face it; the concept of Stark building an Iron Man in about three days is absurd. But Downey simply pulls it off, and does what the best actors in a comic book films do, he makes us metaphorically believe that a ""man can fly.""

But no matter, even a weak resolution can't dim the fun of 'IRON MAN.' Faithful to the political undercurrents of the original comic, brilliant in its casting of Robert Downey Jr., and with finely-tuned action thanks to the tight direction of Jon Favreau, here's the rare comic book film that has something to say and says it with great excitement and nerve. 'IRON MAN' is in my mind totally perfect, but if only all comic book films were this much fun  but you be assured that 'IRON MAN' may well surprise you and you will have a rollercoaster ride of your lifetime in an action pack film of this genre.

IRON MAN Blu-ray Video Quality  'IRON MAN' comes to Blu-ray as the most eagerly and most anticipated Paramount title of that year, and perhaps that of any major studio. This is the kind of film you hope will deliver a new demo disc, and the kind of film that you bought a Blu-ray player for in the first place; well you will not be disappointed. The film has a split personality for a visual style. Shot with both traditional anamorphic and Super35 film processes, the early desert scenes have a much starker, grittier quality, while the latter half of the film is much more glossy and slick. As such, while the source is spotless, there are some apparently intentional inconsistencies in contrast, blacks and colour saturation. When the film really kicks into gear and introduces IRON MAN, is when the presentation really soars. Colours are vibrant and lush, blacks excellent, and detail and depth quite wonderful. Flesh tones also become a bit more realistic, giving the film a very polished look yet still retaining a natural and dimensional picture. There are many sequences here (particularly Iron Man's first night flight, as well as the climactic battle) that can easily serve as demo material. Despite some inconsistencies, Paramount has produced an impeccable encoded 1080p image.

IRON MAN Blu-ray Audio Quality  Paramount Pictures provides a 5.1 Dolby TrueHD Surround mix 'IRON MAN,' and it's terrific. Now, this is what Home Cinema Theatre is all about, and this Blu-ray is bound to be a new showroom staple at Best Buys across the nation. Dynamics are also superb. Low bass is some of the best I've heard, and with the films climactic battle in particular, is a real scorcher. The full frequency spectrum is note-perfect, and at a loud volume, the level of clarity and detail is reference-quality. Dialogue is firmly placed in the centre channel except for a few vocal effects, and is never overwhelmed by the action. 'IRON MAN' is definitely going to be one of this year's most justifiably-praised demo soundtracks on Blu-ray.

IRON MAN Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Hall of Armor [1080p] This interactive function is not a feature so much as a fully-controllable 3D still gallery. Here you enter the ""Stark Database"" and its three Iron Man suits, as well as the Iron Monger. You can check out detailed images of each, as well as ""zoom"" around each suit to get a closer look. Very nicely done.

Special Feature Documentary: The Invisible Iron Man [1080p] [49:00] This six-part chronicles the creation, evolution of the original Iron Man comic book character. A host of comic book types are interviewed, including Marvel kingpin Stan Lee, writer Gerry Conway, and artists John Romita, Jr. and Gene Colan. This offers great context for better appreciating the feature film, as it reveals details that I (being comic book-stupid) had no idea about, including Lee's intention for Iron Man to be a very un-Marvel-like, his surprising appeal to women readers, and the socio-political underpinnings to the character. An excellent documentary. The six parts are: Origins [8:00]; Friends & Foes [4:00]; Definitive Iron Man [5:00]; Demon in a Bottle [2:00]; Extremis and Beyond [26:00] and Ultimate Iron Man [4:00].

Deleted / Extended Scenes [1080p] [24:00] There are eleven scenes in total. The extended clips are of little interest, with most mere dialogue padding that doesnt add up to much. However, there are a couple of nice additions to the final battle which deliver more action, which are probably the highlights here. Note that though these scenes are presented in full HD, the effects in some clips remain unfinished. At times there are also time codes and other graphic overlays, which can be distracting.

IRON MAN 2 Blu-ray Review  With IRON MAN 2 you get Tony Stark saying, ""I am Iron Man."" With those four words, Tony Stark [Robert Downey Jr.] changed his life forever. No longer just a malcontent billionaire munitions-manufacturer, after a harrowing near-death experience that left a piece of dangerous shrapnel embedded in his chest, he has made it his life's mission to vanquish evil in all of its forms, all the while wearing a cool, handsome, gold-and-red robotic suit.

'IRON MAN 2' opens in Russia, where an old man, a former collaborator with Tony Stark's father, dies in poverty. His son, Anton Vanko [Mickey Rourke], vows revenge against Tony Stark, who has just unmasked himself on television. Anton Vanko a skilled technician goes about building his own version of the Iron Man get-up, although this one is fairly low-rent and features electrified tentacles that he can bandy about like whips. We then zoom ahead six months. Iron Man, in full-suited armour, jets into an arena, part of a World's Fair type technology showcase that Tony Stark has put on under the demurely heading of Stark Expo.

Well, Tony Stark is being investigated by the justice department (led by a lugubrious idiot senator played by Garry Shandling) because they want to use the technology for the government; Tony Stark's bro-mance with Rhodey (Don Cheadle, replacing Terrence Howard) has soured, and Rhodey has gotten his hands on an earlier Iron Man suit, which he formats to become new hero War Machine; Stark's megalomaniacal rival Justin Hammer [Sam Rockwell] teams up with Vanko to take down Iron Man; Tony is dying from the Iron Man doo-dad in his chest (which coincides nicely with his long dormant issues with his father, played by Roger Sterling himself John Slattery); and Nick Fury [Samuel L. Jackson] wants Tony to help him with his ""Avengers Initiative,"" which includes double agent Black Widow [Scarlett Johansson]. I'm sure Im missing something. Oh right, Pepper Potts [Gwyneth Paltrow] is now running Tony Stark's company, which includes overseeing the Expo.

If you liked the first one, then I know you will definitely enjoy 'IRON MAN 2.' Because the sequel is bigger, louder, noisier, more scattered, and totally awesome action packed film from start to. To me the other reviews I have read give this film the thumbs down, well again as I have commented before, these idiots must have been viewing a different film, as I think it is a totally rollicking fun and these negative critics should keep their narrow minded views to themselves, as panning this film gives a very bad impression on someone thinking of purchasing this Blu-ray disc because 'IRON MAN 2' is a brilliant film and when you see how cool it is when you see all the robots smashing into other robots, now thats my kind of film to get the adrenalin working.

IRON MAN Blu-ray Video Quality  The 1080p encoded transfer is absolutely incredible and the aspect ratio of 2.35:1, will set your pulses racing and as far as I am concerned IRON MAN 2 is heading straight to the high definition top of the charts and is the cream of the crop stuff. In fact, this transfer is so good you wonder why every new, big budget film cannot get this kind of treatment on Blu-ray. Colours are vivid and pop with all the gusto you'd expect from a superhero movie; detail is rich and strong, particularly the various costumes and in the sharpness of the Stark Expo; black levels are deep and inky; and the visual effects, of which there are many, look gorgeous and fully realized and, unlike some Blu-ray transfers, the high definition transfer doesn't make the effects look phony. While there isn't a single speck of grain, the transfer has a wonderfully lush, film-like appearance, thanks largely to the sleek and layered cinematography by Matthew Libatique. Atmospheric effects like dust, sparks, holographic schematics and flying debris look wonderful and add a lot to the overall feeling of the transfer.

IRON MAN 2 Blu-ray Audio Quality  Let me toss some adoration in the direction of the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound, the mightiness of which probably upset many of my neighbours with its sheer, bass-rattling awesomeness, luckily being retired, I am able to view this Blu-ray and luckily no one is about. Action film mixes of this calibre don't get much better than this. I've watched the disc a couple of times since getting my review copy, and every time I watch it I'm taken aback by slightly different things: the big whoosh that the drones make when landing around our cornered heroes; the sonic blast that the War Machine produces when he buzzes the Air Force tower;' the way the cars collide into each other in the race track sequence; and the delicate way that the dialogue gymnastics between Robert Downey Jr. and anybody else he chooses to talk to. Your surround channels will get a good work out, the dialogue sounds wonderful, and everything is in its right place. Like the pristine transfer, there really isn't any reason that other big budget Hollywood movies can't sound this good when released on Blu-ray. It's just simply wonderful.

IRON MAN 2 Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary by Jon Favreau: Jon Favreau seems like a stand-up dude, and elsewhere on the bonus disc you see him going in to record this commentary, shortly after he completed work on the film and before it actually opened to critical and commercial response that, both of which weren't exactly overwhelming. He talks about how the movie was reshaped as it went along, even throughout the film, and discusses things that you will eventually see on the second disc. Further evidence of this is a scene Jon refers to wherein Mickey Rourke kills his pet parrot  he says, emphatically, that it'll be in the deleted scenes collection but when you visit that part of the second disc. I am not going to pretend that I didn't pour through the extras looking for a reference, any reference, to Sam Rockwell's radioactively orange palms, and it finally came up in the commentary! This track is well worth a listen, even if you're not listening through it in an attempt to piece together Jon Favreau and Marvel's strained relationship.

Special Feature: S.H.I.E.L.D. Data Vault: This is an ""enhanced viewing mode,"" if you want to go along with the jargon, and you can watch two different paths of information and there's 'Footage Scan Mode,' which, besides having a vaguely Orwellian name, is fun and gives background information on different sequences and pops up when those sequences play. If you're a nerd, then this is for you, baby! Also, since this is a BD-Live equipped organism, the information can be updated, which they might want to do considering all the Hulk-related stuff currently features Edward Norton, who has already been replaced for 'The Avengers' with Mark Ruffalo.

Special Feature: Previsualization and Animatics: This is another enhanced viewing option, this time what pops up are the different ""drafts"" of the production, with storyboards, then pre-visualized animation, then rough footage before all the final effects were could be put in place (they used some kind of motion capture technology that was developed for 'Avatar' called ""The Volume""). Again, these bits pop up to their corresponding sequence during the movie, but unlike the S.H.I.E.L.D. stuff.

Special Feature: Ultimate Iron Man: The Making of Iron Man 2 [1080p] [147 minutes] This is a really wonderful, feature length documentary that you can also watch split into four separate sections, each detailing a phase of pre-production, production, post-production, etc. It combines on-set photography and interviews with separate interviews by all the creative principles and cast members. Jon Favreau looks really frazzled, having to deal with an ever-mutating script and the demands of a big budget Hollywood movie, but does a good job maintaining a sense of cool throughout the on-set footage.

Special Feature: 1. Creating Stark Expo. 2. Practical Digital Meets. 3. Illustrated Origin: Nick Fury. 4. Illustrated Origin: Black Widow. 5. Illustrated Origin: War Machine. 6. Working with DJ AM.

Deleted Scenes [1080p] [16:50] These scenes can be watched with our without Jon Favreau commentary and I suggest watching them, even on an initial run-through, with the commentary. An introduction of Pepper on the plane, where she kisses the Iron Man helmet before throwing it out of the plane; an elongated version of the senate hearing which explains where Pepper went and shows Sam Rockwell playing with an Iron Man figurine (not kidding); and just some alternate exposition stuff. The scene with Mickey Rourke killing the bird is sadly not here, and further evidence of Marvel's meddling.

Special Feature: Concept Art Galleries: Proof that 'IRON MAN 2' cost a whole bunch of money and a lot of that money didn't even make it to the big screen, these gorgeous galleries (11 in total) will make your eyes water with possibility. Really worth checking out.

Theatrical Trailers [1080p] [6:22] One teaser, two trailers, all in HD, you can skip these, especially if you've never seen the film away, they give away fairly big plot points and action beats, but, hey, anything to get those butts in the seats.

Other Marvel Trailers [1080p] [5:33] Two trailers for the middling SEGA tie-in videogame and one for an animated Avengers films that looks god-awful. Skip this please.

Special Feature: ""Shoot to Thrill"" AC/DC Music Video [1080p] [5:37] I had totally forgotten about this bizarre, cross-promotional 'IRON MAN 2' album that was really just a loose collection of AC/DC greatest hits. This so weird. This ""video"" is archival footage of AC/DC doing their thing live, inter-cut with action from the movie and is just as pointless as hollow as the album it came from. Oh another thing, why do these crass ghastly Heavy Metal Groups have the main singer where you can never hear the words of the song sung by the main singer? What is it with these concerts, all you will get is a headache and if you were actually at that concert, you would definitely have to seek medical health, as you will definitely go deaf.

Finally, 'IRON MAN' is one of the better comic book adaptations to come out of Hollywood in eons and with a climax that is totally brilliant, it's enlivened by a wonderful performance by Robert Downey, Jr., and even classifies as a sleeper as expectations weren't necessarily that high upon its original release. This Blu-ray is unequivocally terrific, however, with great video and even better audio, plus hours of HD-quality supplements. 'IRON MAN' on Blu-ray is totally awesome. 'IRON MAN 2' is at times indebted to its predecessor film and at the same time deviating wildly into turbo drive. Overall, it's totally fun, entertaining and diverting enough, and possibly laying the groundwork for future Marvel films. This disc is everything you could want, besides that deleted scene where Mickey Rourke kills the bird, and a definitive explanation for Sam Rockwell's orange palms, with absolutely brilliant audio and video and a whole host of extras. These first 2 x IRON MAN Blu-ray releases comes highly praised and a well worth adding to your Marvel Comic Blu-ray Collection and it has definitely gone pride of place to my ever increasing Robert Downey Jr. Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!
