8045878,5,B00078MHQA,"This DVD set has some of the ""hottest"" documentary footage I've ever seen. What you get is tons and tons of huge fires in black and white. My favorite is the munitions plant that not only catches fire but also keeps exploding as bombs inside blow up. Each fire is cooler than the next and I'm shocked that photographers were able to get close enough to some of these to catch them on film. Overall it's one of the most exciting documentaries I've ever seen in my life.",1154044800,,468,4.329545454545454
8045879,5,B00078MHQA,"First off, I want to say something about the customer service of the studio. When I got my set in the mail, one of the disks would not play, so I contacted them online. They fedexed me a new copy the next day, no questions asked and I was very impressed.

The films themsevles are also great. If you are familiar with the Stillman collection, you have a pretty good idea of what you will get. This is all vintage silent footage of massive fires. The boat fire is the most exciting, but I do have to warn you that the shots of fire victims are very graphic. The director ""caught flames"" well with the camera which is hard to do and there are amazing scenes of the firemen battling huge blazes.",1148342400,,692,4.242424242424242
8045880,4,B00078MHQA,"What we have here is a 2 DVD set with film clips of vairous fires. They are from the Stillman fire collection. Most of the films are from the 1940's. There are scenes of ships ablaze, individual buildings burning, dock fires etc. A few famous fires, such as the LaSalle Hotel fire and the Winecoff Hotel fires (both in 1946) are included. Also there are scenes of people who perished in fires, and may be disturbing to some people. I give this four stars because of the musical score. Not too bad in itself, but it gets repititious and annoying. Otherwise, it is a fascinating set.",1116633600,,581,4.490566037735849
