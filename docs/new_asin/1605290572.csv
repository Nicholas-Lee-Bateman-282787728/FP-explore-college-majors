201189,3,1605290572,"I'm at an intermediate fitness level, and wanted a workout that I could do at home in less than an hour.
""Look Better Naked"" fits the bill. There's a cardio workout that will make you breathless and sweaty, and a strength/sculpt workout that will take you closer to a long, lean look.
However, I would say that if you have any knee trouble, this DVD isn't for you. There are a lot of leaps, and jumps, as well as squats and lunges. My knees aren't even bad, but I sometimes find them sore, after this workout, no matter how good my form.

""Look Better Naked"" Pros:

*--separate cardio/strength workouts that start and end with a warm-up/cool down that can also be played as one long workout

*--optional music-only audio track (which I find extremely useful on the days that I want to strangle anyone talking to me during a workout, no matter how encouraging they are)

*--Beginner modifications, for those of us just starting, or if we're feeling lazy or winded. ;)

*--I really like that I feel like I'm getting a butt-kicking workout in just 30 minutes (less, if I skip the cool down). I have seen results, even without many diet modifications--especially in my legs. (Must be all the jumping and squatting that I complain about... ;D )

Cons:

*--When you play the routines, either 30 minute or the entire thing, the background models are introduced during the warm-up, and then again at the beginning of each exercise portion. Is this necessary? We just ""met"" these girls five minutes ago. Also--I wish there was an option for people who are familiar with the workout to watch a version with less chatter from Ms Smith, who seems to very much enjoy the sound of her own voice. I have better things to do with my time than listen to her natter on, and I'd just as soon get on with the workout.

*--The cardio routines can be tough to follow, even for someone used to following exercise routines--Smith moves into the next thing pretty fast. Though she explains what's coming up, it's still kind of easy to get out of sync. I'd think it was just me if I hadn't seen other reviews that say the same thing.

*--Squats in the warm-up. To me, squats count as the work-out, and I'd rather do moves that limber me before I move into squats.

*--There is a hell of a lot of jumping around in the ""metabolic"" cardio workout. It will get your heart rate up, but, I'm over 30, and it can also be kind of hard on the knees. Just sayin'.

All you need are dumb bells (whatever weight you're comfortable with), a mat (probably not even that, if you have carpeting), and good workout shoes.

Over all, I'm pleased with this DVD. I like some points more than others, but what counts is, I feel like I'm getting a great workout, in less time than I was spending before. If that's what you're looking for, then I say, go for it. :D",1297296000,34,2817,4.4591439688715955
201190,3,1605290572,"i do one form or another of exercise everyday, from yoga to all sorts of cardio and strength training. i was a hard core runner until a knee injury about a year ago, so i mix it up with all sorts of dvds. i got this dvd when i ordered the book(which i highly recommend, its less of a diet book and more about motivation and healthy lifestyle) and was super excited to try a new exciting workout. it gets your heart rate going and energy pumping within the first min. but then its all down hill from there...i had to rewind so many times i lost any effect the cardio was having on my body. the moves are great and i see them being highly effective if i didn't have to watch the same thing 5 times to be able to do it right. its hard to keep proper form when you don't know what you are doing and thats how injuries happen and i definitely have enough of those. im hoping after a few tries i will get the routine down and be able to follow along for the full benefits, but if you are looking for a great powerful, challenging workout get any of jillian Michael's dvd, she drives me nuts but she makes me want to conquer whatever she throws at me.",1296172800,3,1144,4.066371681415929
201191,2,1605290572,I have tons of exercise dvds and this one is way too hard to follow. I get lost in all the steps and moves and I don't have trouble with my other dvds. Stick will Jillian Michaels or Jackie Warner.,1295827200,6,197,3.95
201192,5,1605290572,"I love getting a fantastic cardio or strength workout done in 30 minutes, including the warm-up and cool down. Both workouts here are challenging, but a background exerciser, Jenny, shows modified moves so you can follow her when you need to. The moves are easy to learn, but they are also given in text on the bottom of the screen. Would be good for anyone from an Intermediate to Advanced fitness level. Jessica is encouraging throughout and cues very well.",1294876800,5,459,4.75
201193,5,1605290572,"First off I want to say that the release dates on Amazon drive me nuts! I have now noticed this with many new DVDs that you can get them elsewhere weeks or months ahead of when Amazon thinks it will be released. Very strange!
Anyway, on to the review. I have exercised all my life (over 25 years) and consider myself advanced and very knowledgeable when it comes to DVDs (I own hundreds). I like Jessica as an instructor, she cues well and even if she makes it challenging, there is no dread factor.
This DVD consists of a warm up, a 20 minute cardio interval segment, a 20 minute strength training segment with abs and a cool down/stretch. Total workout is 50 minutes. Additional shorter options on the DVD are the cardio workout with warm up and stretch (30 min), and the strength workout with warm up and stretch (30 min) if you want to do them on alternate days. The cardio alternates high and low impact and the time just flies by. The strength training has a medium to fast pace, so if you go heavy this can be extremely challenging, but she leaves you just enough time to grab another set of weights between exercises so that you don't have to stop the DVD (I find this important). One of the background exercisers also shows beginner modifications. I felt I got a really good sweatty total body workout in just under an hour. Very pleasant and satisfying workout, highly recommended!",1288569600,99,1391,4.5019762845849804
201194,5,1605290572,"After hitting 35, getting surgery, and a new job my body isn't what it used to be.  I wanted something do-able, enjoyable, short or long workout, and just something I'd stick with.  This dvd (and the book) are a definite recommendation.  Trust me I've scoured the web for something that would fit me.

It says it will be released in December but I managed to grab a copy at Target.  I love working out at home and have a vast array of exercise dvds.  This dvd is actually 30 minutes of strength and 30 minutes of metabolic workout.  I like how you can do either one of them or the whole dvd combined.  Keep in mind if you choose to do an individual workout it will tack on the warm up and cool down. I am doing the workout in conjunction of the book.  Love the book too.  The two day cleanse and six week diet plan is totally do-able.  (Your talking to the girl who loves big macs.)

With that being said.  The workout is enjoyable and time flies pretty fast.  I am a clutz who has two left feet but managed to look like I know what I'm doing.  I did manage to break a sweat.  The instructor is enjoyable and they do have beginner modifications if needed.  I've done the firm, ta boe, among others.  I find this dvd one I'm going to continue to use until I look better naked?  Lol.  Definite recommendation!",1287187200,30,1307,4.2145748987854255
201195,4,1605290572,"I actually enjoyed this dvd alot. I got the book and liked it so much I was curious to get the dvd as well too. I would say my level of fitness is about intermediate to advance and I think this dvd does pretty well catering to different levels. Workouts are short but effective, a great workout to do when you are short on time. This is a good one to keep in your workout dvd collection.",1278374400,3,387,4.038961038961039
201196,4,1605290572,"I guess I lucked out with being able to get this from Amazon - it's now currently listed as unavailable. At any rate, I really enjoy this workout and it changes up my current Jillian Michaels DVD routine.  This workout is broken into 2 different workouts: Metabolic, and Strength training. Each workout is 30 mins and includes a 5 min warmup and cooldown. I really enjoy the strength training workout - very challenging and I started seeing results within a week.  The metabolic workout (cardio interval training) is also pretty tough.  If you like Jillian Michaels' straightforward workouts (no dance routines - just straight up jumping jacks or squat jumps) then you'll probably like this workout since it falls under the same category.  Give it a try!",1275264000,10,754,4.913385826771654

201202,5,1605290572,"I have had this for quite a while and I still use it on average 3 times a week. It hasn't gotten old to me... Yet! It's definitely a sound workout and worth the time. I don't exactly have time to give up in my day and the 30-50 minutes used with this is totally worth it. I could definitely tell a change in my body, as well as other people. This is a great DVD to have in my opinion!!!!",1389744000,7,387,3.7901234567901234
201203,3,1605290572,I loved this exercise DVD. She is really easy to follow and understand. The reason I gave it 3 stars is she does lots of squats and I have a bad knee so I have a hard time doing lots of squats . Other wise loved it.,1389312000,,215,3.595744680851064

201205,5,1605290572,"Great DVD that was shipped super fast! Love the club/trance-y music in the background. Two workouts make it so I don't get bored especially since I mix them with two days of yoga (from a different DVD). So I do two metabolic days, two strength days, and two yoga days. Sunday is my recovery day. But back to the DVD. The instructor is fine, she has her ""blond moments""a few times (you'll see what I mean), but I find her to be cheery within boundaries and easygoing, which is perfect for the purposes of the workout. The workout itself goes super fast as it constantly changes which makes you concentrate and keeps you from getting bored, which in turn makes time go fast. The overall routine ranges from easy steps to tough (tougher) pushups. I like that you get a breather once in a while, but I also like that the breather is fairly fleeting and in no time you start on a new challenge. I cannot say I see much changes yet, but I have only been doing it for two weeks (and I have not curtailed my starbucks frappuccinos trips), but at the very least this video makes me feel good and gives me energy for the day :-)",1382745600,3,1118,4.303317535545023
201206,5,1605290572,"I used this for the first time last night and I felt it during the workout, all night after and still today!

I am slightly out of shape and am just getting back into being consistent with my workouts. I had to modify a few of the moves but still felt like I was working hard. The moves are difficult enough to feel the burn but not so hard you want to quit. She also doesn't spend too much time on any one exercise which I appreciate greatly! For my body, switching it up between multiple different movements gets me quickest results.

This is my first Jessica Smith DVD and I really like her style. I can only judge my experience on the workout and not the results (yet) but if the way I am feeling today is any indication, I'll be seeing results soon! Great product and fast shipping too.",1380240000,5,791,4.231788079470198

201208,5,1605290572,"I saw an ad in women's health, featuring this DVD and decided to check it out on youtube (short clips) before ordering (the title made me a bit reluctant). I got it for $10 or less and was the best dvd I purchased. I own a few workout dvds (30 day shred, mary winsor pilates,etc) and this is definitely my favorite one. The instructor is really pleasant, the cardio workout makes you sweat more than an hour at the gym. There are a lot of squats and lunges, so if you don't like these exercises, this is not for you. I haven't been doing it persistently enough to see results (it's recommended to do it 4 times a week - do cardio twice and strength twice; I use this on days when I don't feel going to the gym), but I feel stronger.",1378080000,7,732,4.125874125874126
201209,1,1605290572,I am dissatisfied with this DVD as I was with the previous one due to them both being the incorrect play zone! It should be play zone 2 for South Africa!  I have reported the previous and have had no response! Please sort this out for me!,1376870400,,238,4.0638297872340425

201211,3,1605290572,This is aerobics in an old school way.  I've used the video once and haven't gone back.  The instruction is average.  The music is average.  Just an average type of workout DVD.,1376352000,3,177,4.4375
201212,3,1605290572,"The exercises are legit - basically the same types of exercises I have seen on Jillian Michaels, or Insanity dvds.  The quality is just okay - a bit fuzzy.  The music is terribly boring...I think they could have made this more fun but overall it is a good workout so I'm giving it a 3 star.",1373587200,,290,4.160714285714286

The first few times I did this work out, I felt EXTREMELY sore the next day.  I really think this is a great way for women to tone and become stronger all over.  This DVD is also very well put together and beautifully done.  I have quite a few work out DVDs and this is one of my favorites!",1367971200,3,465,4.065934065934066

201217,5,1605290572,"One of the strongest and most efficient workout DVDs I've found in a long while. Combining equal parts cardio and strength training, Jessica Smith hosts with perfection and the moves are challenging but not draining. Perfect to get you feeling confident in your own (naked!) body or ready to go out on a date. I love doing this workout in the morning; I feel better about the way I look all day. There are some minor drawbacks, like the distracting labels the makers put across the screen for each exercise, but the actual workout itself is TOP-NOTCH and one of my favorite routines out of a gigantic workout DVD collection. Be ready to work and don't be afraid to use heavier weights than they recommend! (I use 8 lbs even though they say 2-3).",1366588800,4,745,4.567164179104478
201218,2,1605290572,i bought this DVD from a second hand store and i was hoping that it was going to be like a nude workout kinda movie but no nudity.,1365552000,,130,3.6785714285714284
201219,4,1605290572,"I loved doing this tough workout! Jessica Smith is calm but motivating and takes you through both cardio and strength training workout. You can opt to do the 20 min strength and 20 minute cardio sections separately or altogether. I did it in one go and it is KILLER- but in a great way. you definitely feel muscle soreness the next day
Another big plus is that she uses alot of compound moves (like Jackie Warner) so you never really do just one thing at once. You use multiple muscle groups hence increasing your fat burn.
I dropped a star because at the beginning of the DVD the cueing was a little (just a little!) off but as the workout progressed this improved.
I thought this was destined to be another ""girly"" workout but Jessica Smith delivers. You definitely want to add this one to your workout DVD rotation.",1364342400,,818,4.496644295302014

201221,5,1605290572,These were great workouts. They are both challenging and will make you sweat. You can make modifications as needed. I had to stop a couple of times and drink something but then when right back to it. It is doable but exhausting.,1362355200,,228,4.4523809523809526

201223,4,1605290572,"I am writing this review having followed the program for 6 weeks (and 4 times per week) as it suggests, and I have to say I truly was impressed! This workout has given me RESULTS! Both workouts are doable. You'll find yourself needing to modify the first few times/weeks you do it, but as you stick with it, you will see yourself getting further and further. For example, doing pushups from your toes instead of your knees, or being able to jump with the burpees. Just PUSH yourself. If you don't, the workouts WILL get easier, but you'll only be cheating yourself of the results!

The moves in particular that killed me were the spiderman pushups (mainly because they fall at the end of the workout), as well as the burpees (ouch!), but overall the workouts together were the perfect fit. The metabolic workout WILL get your heartrate up, and the strength workout WILL make you sore.

I've stuck with this workout for 6 weeks straight and have seen significant definition specifically in my quads, abs, calves, arms, and back! It will work you from head to foot and you'll notice stronger muscles! Highly recommend this!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because sticking with it for 6 weeks can be a challenge just because the workouts get a little boring and repetitive. Granted, there are 2 workouts (thank goodness!), but there were definitely days when I pushed play when I really didn't want to. Luckily, it was worth it!",1360972800,5,1446,4.64453125

Jessica and her girlz' start off with a low impact warm up which prepares you for a high energy cardio routine.  She isn't cheap with the lunges, and my booty and thighs thank her kindly.  I love that there is strength training and an option for music only, but I need a little more time learning a few of the moves before I choose that option.

I also like that they included Jenny in the DVD to do modifications.  I can do most exercises without modifying, but as others said, if you have knee issues, some of the exercises are better done using the modifications.  After a few weeks of doing this DVD, I can definitely tell a difference in my performance.  I also enjoyed watching the ""Behind the Scenes"" portion and learning that Jessica Smith used to weigh 40 pounds more.  In my opinion, this makes working out with her more motivating - she's right in the trenches with the rest of us.  Excellent cueing and a great workout when limited on time.

I can't attest to the title yet as I've only done it 1x, but it will have a spot in my rotation of workout dvds.  I also like that the cardio section does have a couple of moves that require my mental focus at times, because I think that makes you work a little harder.  Overall, I would recommend this to anyone regardless of fitness level, because you can do one or both segments and feel like you've gotten a decent workout in under an hour.
Update: I used this less than I thought I would because I thought the cardio was too danc-y. I found I wasn't working as hard as I liked to. The 2nd segment still impressed me but is not for total beginners, so though the cardio is probably accessible to most, the strength portion might require modifications, or, turn off some.",1312329600,,890,4.349397590361446
201239,5,1605290572,"Several things to share before I get right to my review:  I refuse to diet, I eat well enough to keep me happy, healthy and above all satisfied; I'm a 6 days/week type of workout gal when I go hardcore;  I've tried P90X with virtually no results at the halfway point;  I've been super lazy about my fitness since about mid-February and my body composition has changed drastically.  All that said, here's my story:

While at Target, I spotted this DVD.  My husband, god love him, listened when I said I'd be too embarrassed to buy it 'in person', and used an app on his phone to scan the barcode and find it on Amazon.  Then, again - god love him - despite the fact that he has always thought I looked smokin' naked, he knew I wasn't happy with me so he ordered it.  It sat on our DVD shelf staring at me for about a week before I decided it was time.  My 3 day/week yoga just wasn't cutting it and this promised I'd be comfy in my own skin in six weeks.  Considering I'd tried P90X last year - complete with diet modification! - and hadn't seen any change...  Seriously, all that changed was I could do really cool push ups and more chin-ups than ever before, but the way I looked and my energy level were the same.  I think it was the program itself with it's hour long workouts and super-guilt diet that was stressing me so much I couldn't change my appearance.

Anyway, I'm now 3 weeks into this ""Look Better Naked"" program and I'm seeing major changes!  I haven't modified my diet any except perhaps drinking more water.  This is a lean-meat, whole-grain, fat-free, fresh fruit and veg kind of household.  We don't even keep chips or cookies around except my son's chocolate chip Teddy Grahams.  See?  We eat just fine.  But this program, wow!  I'm not kidding, I'd recommend it to anyone, even those with bad knees - just follow the modified, low-impact version.

Since there are 'off' days (cuz you're only supposed to do it 4 times/week) I fill the other two with Yoga, Pilates, biking or jogging, but I'm really impressed with how my look has changed so quickly.  Even that wonderful hubby who already thought I looked great has mentioned he's seeing a difference.  I know I see smoother skin on the back of my thighs, my waist is smaller, my forearms are tighter, my bustline is lifted, my backside is tighter and I'm actually seeing some abdominal definition!  This has seriously put a 180 on the downward slope of laziness I was on.

A lot of people have said they don't, but I happen to like the constant commentary and encouragement, it keeps me going when other DVDs (where it's primarily music) would have had me quitting.  If I want my own music, I'll get that when I bike or run.  When I'm watching a DVD I want it to feel like I have my own trainer, and you know if you were at the gym with a personal trainer they'd be encouraging you with every rep.  Giving this 5 stars because of all the workout videos in my collection, this one is making things better the fastest.

I will stick with it for the last 3 weeks, and probably add it to the rotation of my other stuff once I get that bikini bod I'm gunnin' for.  Good luck to anyone who tries this out, I say if you stick to it and push as hard as you can, you will be as happy with the results as I am.  (:",1307664000,74,3276,4.286644951140065
201240,4,1605290572,"I truly like this DVD because it's a great supplement to the book. I alternate between the two like for instance, I'd do the metabolic portion of DVD on Monday, the strength portion of DVD on Tuesday, then come Thursday, strength workout from the book, then the metabolic from book as well on Friday, but I find myself going back to the video on Friday's instead-just another option then....It says you only have to workout four times a week, but I like adding in a cardio only on the Wednesday from another DVD, and I try to do another on Saturday, or I'd just rest or do some yoga. The cardio is not super intense, but it does make me sweat a bit, whereas I have other workout DVD's where I just have buckets of sweat pouring down....but after the 6 weeks, I'd definitely go back to this one on days where I want a moderate intense workout or a short one....it's a 20 minute routine, but add in warm up and cool down it's right around 30. And, I never tried this, but I bet you can do the entire video for more calorie burn on days you can commit to a longer workout, but then you can take the next day off!",1305849600,,1109,4.186915887850467
201241,5,1605290572,"Being a person that is EXTREMELY short on time on a regular basis, this workout is perfect for me. It includes one metabolic workout and one strength workout with weight plus a warmup and cool down that is added to each one of these. It's about 10 minutes for the warmup, 20 minutes for the workout and 10 for the cooldown. Both workouts are super time efficient and you WILL feel them the following day. I am an intermediate exerciser and did find these workouts a little easier than say Jillian Michaels or P90X but again, if you want a quick effective workout for a busy day when you want to just squeeze something in really quick, this is it.",1301184000,,646,4.391666666666667

Once I tried it, this dvd quickly moved to the top of my collection of work out videos. It is an intense work out, especially if you don't really work out on a regular basis, with results that you see quickly and feel instantly. Another great perk to this dvd is the fact that all you need to do it is a mat, a pair of dumbells, and enough drive to get thru the entire workout! I would and have recommended it to anyone who is looking for a good, quick, at home work out.",1299196800,,588,3.9915254237288136
201243,4,1605290572,"The DVD: Look Better Naked, DVD Workout by Michele Promaulayko, editor & chief of Women's Health.

The PROMISE: ""6 weeks to your leanest, hottest body ever!""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Look-Better-Naked/dp/B00429C1UC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Look Better Naked</a>

The Look Better Naked workout DVD is only one part of her multi-faceted program which includes a step by step book, attitude adjustment, beauty makeover, nutritional plan & other fully illustrated workouts beyond the DVD. The claim that it will give you the best body ever in 6 weeks is meant to be fulfilled in conjunction with this plan: not the DVD alone.

To keep things simple (and because I don't have 6 weeks to devote to her program) I'll be reviewing the DVD on its own. I did each of the 2 workouts twice, once each individually and once back to back. The DVD allows both options.

The RUNDOWN:

  * Running Time: 54 minutes total, or 30 minutes per workout.
  * Number of Workouts: 2
  * Equipment Needed: Light-Medium Dumbbells (3-6lbs), mat, towel.
  * Trainer: Jessica Smith
  * Bonus Features: Behind the scenes look, plus online resources.
  * Approx. $$: $10-15 depending.

  Music: Generic music, very much in the background. Not the best, but unnoticeable (better than crappy and in your face, right?)

  Style: Interval based cardio & strength training. Similar to a boot-camp in formal, but not as hardcore in feel.

  Difficulty: Uncomplicated movements that most exercisers will be familiar with. Fairly intense at maximum effort, but options are provided for customization and beginner fitness levels.

  Best Suited For: Intermediate to advanced, but beginners will be able to do most of the modifications and change the intensity when needed.

  The Morning After: Next day soreness was fair, but manageable. Really felt it in my quads & shoulders (thank you Lunge-A-Palooza & Spiderman Pushups). Soreness will depend on a few factors, including how much you put into the moves, but I found a little extra stretching after the workout took care of it.

HOW TO USE IT:
It's recommended that you do each workout twice a week (4 x 30min workouts total). If you're used to Jillian Michael's style workouts, you can probably swap this workout in for an equal burn. Because of the half hour format, it's easy to squeeze into anyone's schedule and on days when you want a bigger burn? Do both sections.

THE WORKOUT

Look Better Naked features two unique, total body workouts, which you can do separately or back to back. Individually, they're about 30 minutes long, including 10 minutes for the warm-up and cool-down. The workout runs about 54 minutes without separating the workouts.

  * Metabolic (fat-burning) 30 min.
  * Strength (toning) 30 min.

Metabolic
  The metabolic workout is a quick, interval based, total body workout that has a bit of a boot-camp feel. The high intensity intervals will bring your heart rate all the way up for short periods of time, then back down while still giving you a great workout. The workout is straightforward, no dance routines or choreography to learn. If you like Jillian Michael's 30 day Shred, this workout has a similar format but a bit more upbeat in instruction.

  There's a lot of plyometrics (jump training), which is fabulous to get the heart rate up. If you've got joint problems, or are still working up to it, non-jumping modifications are given and easily explained. Your lower body will get a great workout, but be prepared for a lunge-a-palooza! Squats are also on the menu. Because the workout is fast paced, you don't stay on one movement for long, so it's manageable.

Strength
  You can do this workout with or without weights, but weights are recommended. I don't suggest going as heavy as you may be used to. Normally, I'd opt for 8-10lb weights, but 5lbs was PLENTY. You're moving quickly, so if the weights too heavy you might increase your risk for injury. Start low & increase as necessary.

  Lots of variety here, and you'll work your body from head to toe. The workout moves from standing exercises to the floor smoothly and it passes by VERY quickly. Follow modifications if you need to, but be sure to push yourself! For those who are already decently fit, you will need to boost your intensity, weights or range of motion to consistently see results.

HIGH FIVE FOR:
Great marketing & production value. Seriously. Pretty, well designed DVD with great resources if you choose to follow the program more intensely. Every detail was well thought out & much appreciated.

CAUTIONS & CONCERNS:
Lots of squats & lunges, so caution to those with problems in those areas. The modifications may not be enough, but feel free to stop/start when you need to. Just keep moving.

WINS
Interval training burns more calories than steady state exercising and has been proven to boost the fat burning benefits of exercise LONG after you're done your workout. I liked transitioning from move to move quickly, and didn't get bored during my first few runs. Because the moves are uncomplicated, even beginners can pick them up in 1-2 tries. There's no dancing or choreography, just a straightforward workout with lots of variety.

There's an option to turn off instruction and just have the music, which you might like if you're doing the workout often enough. Also, there's a good variety of exercises here, many of which you can do on your own. Great workout for beginners to intermediate. Advanced exercisers may want to boost intensity by adding weight or making the moves bigger. I also really liked Jessica Smith. The moves were well cued, the transitions were smooth from exercise to exercise. She was well-spoken, motivating & clear. In terms of instructor ""type"", she's on the cheery/upbeat side of things, but certainly not overkill (heavy on the ""good-jobs"" but light on the ""yay's"".).

FAILS
The music was BLAH. I'm a bit biased, I really like high energy music. I find I get better workouts when I can get into the tunes I'm working out to. The option to turn off instruction and have just the music is great, but I wish it was vice versa. :(. In the long run, I may resort to muting the DVD and having my own play-list in the background.

The workouts are uncomplicated, which is great at first but bad for the long term. Some DVD's have a longer learning curve, so you'll see improvements over longer periods of time. This workout will get boring if you're using it exclusively for more than a month of so (maybe sooner). It's designed to be done on rotation with the workouts in the book, but mixing it in to your normal DVD rotation or workout routine will help.

MY VERDICT:
Thumbs up. I felt like I could keep up, and the moves weren't too complicated, which I think will help beginners stay motivated. It really did target every muscle group and I got a very decent ""glow"" on. The workouts pack a punch individually, but I felt like I got a helluva workout when I did them back to back. If you're used to weights, consider going lighter than normal and add more weight when you need more of a challenge. I recommend starting between 3-6lbs and follow modifications if necessary.

Overall, this DVD will certainly make my rotation and I highly recommend it for those who'd like a good, quick, uncomplicated workout.

201245,4,1605290572,"I really like this work out it is short, sweet and very effective. BUT, it is very hard on my knees, just as other reviewer commented as well. I am young, not overweight, in good shape and do not have any knee problems, until now that is. I did keep the form and alignment but to no avail.  Contrary yet to another reviewer, I didn't not find her routine hard to follow at all, after 3 times had it down.",1298592000,2,404,4.05
201246,4,1605290572,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

Overall, I got a really great workout (sweated big time.)  Tough but do-able, with a lot of variety to the moves.  Liked the instructor and the the two ""backup dancers"" --- which I think is the perfect number for workout DVDs ---  were non-annoying (which is good.)  There were some moments when I was hustling to follow along with the footwork but nothing major, didn't feel annoyed or lost at any point.  While the workout is rather high impact with quite a bit of jumping (to get your heart rate up), since one of the backup dancers always does the low impact/intensity modification of all the moves it is still possible for beginners and those who prefer low impact to benefit.

For me the main downside was that the instructor talked just a teeny bit too much --- it was non-stop instruction, explanation, motivation, and commentary and I prefer more moments of silence/music or, better yet, just counting.  That said, the DVD does come with the option to turn off commentary  --- not sure if this keeps the cues but I still need those so I don't have to watch the TV the whole time, especially if you are on the floor or facing away.",1298246400,2,1195,4.546728971962617
