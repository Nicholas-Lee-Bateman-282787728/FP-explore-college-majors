5787682,5,B00DBVY8YE,"Somm explores the true nature of some of the most serious part of wine study.  The movie is well edited and keeps you on edge the entire time.  Grab a bottle and sit down for some serious sniffing, tasting and spitting.",1373932800,,219,4.317073170731708
5787683,5,B00DBVY8YE,"If you love wine and want to share a comprehensive passion with other, recommend that documentary.

5787684,5,B00DBVY8YE,"Not snobby or stuffy at all but you'll have to enjoy wine to really appreciate the story or these young people and their endeavor to pass this incredibly hard test to become a Master Sommelier.

5787685,4,B00DBVY8YE,Very much liked the film. As someone who is also studying it gave me encouragement. Yet it was a glimpse of life that those who share an interest in wine would find enjoyable.,1373414400,,175,4.333333333333333
5787686,5,B00DBVY8YE,This was a great documentary... The best part is my son is going through the testing this week here in Dallas!!!! He knows all the players... this is SPOT ON!! GREAT JOB,1373414400,2,169,4.3125
5787687,4,B00DBVY8YE,"I hate reality TV.  OK; I like shows such as ""X Factor"" and even ""American Idol,"" although that latter show is really starting to show it's age.  ""America's Got Talent"" is probably the most entertaining of them all, as it's kind of like a modern-day ""Gong Show.""  The ""funnest"" times are watching the failures on AGT; not necessarily the successes.

But it's hard to call those shows ""Reality TV"" in a way.  Shows such as ""Honey Boo Boo"" fit better into that genre, and they are horrible.  Horrible people, horrible plot, horrible TV.  But this movie almost fits into that category, although this actually works while those don't.

And this works because you care about the characters here, while you couldn't -- or rather shouldn't -- give a dang about people such as Honey Boo Boo, or whatever her real name is.  While you may argue that being so knowledgeable about wine is a waste of time, these guys surely wouldn't agree.  They spend all of their waking hours, perhaps even their dreams, thinking about wine.  And anyone who spends this much time on any passion is someone that you can easily root for, and while your stomach may hurt from drinking too much wine while watching, that same stomach may hurt even more when one or more fails at becoming a Master Sommelier.

I won't tell you who ""wins"" and who ""loses,"" but the one guy that I rooted for the most was Ian Cauble.  Sure, you might argue that he's somewhat cocky.  But it's hard to argue against that fact that he's really knowledgeable, and he really cares about his craft.  And he always seems to keep his head up, which surely must have been hard to do in his years-long goal of getting a pin and prestige.

There are some really good production values here as well.  It was probably shot in HD video, but a lot of the post-production work was really nice.  You see wine pouring and tears flowing in slow motion.  Most documentaries such as these care little about this, but this movie didn't make that mistake.

I say, turn off Honey Boo Boo; she lowers the IQ of all Americans.  But rather turn on ""Somm"" and be amazed that anyone in America can still have this much passion about his work.",1373155200,,2162,4.520618556701031
5787688,5,B00DBVY8YE,"I attend the yearly Sommelier conference TEXSOM even though I am not a sommelier and have an interest in wine. It has been a great learning experience meeting the different level sommeliers including Master Sommeliers, 7 of which right now are in Texas. When this documentary was first announced I knew I had to see it because I wanted to understand what the candidates taking the Master exam went through. Wow, I give every person who attempts this exam credit. The documentary shows the effort and time four candidates put into taking the exam and the eventual outcome for each of the candidates. If you have any interest in wine, this movie is a must see!",1373155200,8,658,4.681034482758621
5787689,5,B00DBVY8YE,"This is a spectacular, gorgeous, riveting documentary about a group of young wine obessionists preparing to attempt a test with a 90%+ fail rate - and which if passed, confers upon the recipient the internationally known and respected title of Master Sommelier.

The human toll on the test-takers, their family and friends, and their stability and sanity is explored. The beauty of the world of wine is magnificently rendered. And the constant, grinding pressure of being asked to memorize the full measure of human knowledge about wine? Well, that's a constant throughout the movie.

You'll enjoy the characters, feel their stress for them, and bite your fingernails. (Fingernails go well with a nice Pinot Grigio, by the way.)

Two thumbs up.",1372723200,9,744,5.132231404958677
5787690,4,B00DBVY8YE,"This engaging documentary follows six fellows who are prepping for the prestigious Master Sommelier exam. Less than 200 candidates have passed this test since it began in 1969; it has one of the lowest pass rates of any exam in the world.

Our 2013 Seattle International Film Festival screening audience was interested, entertained and invested in the outcome. We each had our personal favorites and were appropriately anxious as the test day neared.

Award-winning Director Jason Wise has accumulated wonderful interviews with articulate, funny, intelligent (and ambitious!) candidates. Many of them have photographic memories and when you learn all the minutiae that they must master, it would seem that ONLY candidates with photographic memories could compete! The scope of their education (and those flash-cards) is mind-boggling.

It's fun to get acquainted with the candidates, their wives and girlfriends, other Master Sommeliers, and interested professionals. One father said his son gravitated to this profession because he is very competitive AND wine is an intoxicant. Several wives had some pretty emphatic things to say about that disgusting spit bucket that has become a part of their lives. Sommeliers don't DRINK all that wine, they sniff it, sample it, taste it, analyze it, then spit it out and continue on.

The sequence of wine glasses being destroyed between segments becomes a character itself! The audience would laugh out loud as each glass is broken a bit more. As of 06-08-13 this available for Pre-order from Amazon.",1370649600,13,1543,5.337448559670782

Dive into the well-fermented world of the wine master, and his countless index cards as he and his cohorts navigate the grape in all its many varieties. You'll learn something about, but literally never as much as these guys and gals. Is your sense of scent refined enough for this film? Are your tastebuds as keen and perceiving? Can you detect the region of a grape by its mouthfeel and know which hillside in Bordeaux gave this fruit its youthful feel and light citrus aroma?

5787736,4,B00DBVY8YE,"This is a humorous, intense movie that shares the competitive experiences of a few dedicated souls who are driven to become Master Sommeliers.  A second level Sommelier at the Black Mesa Winery in Taos, NM suggested we view this movie during a conversation where my husband and I expressed an interest in learning more about the career paths a Sommelier.  I found myself smiling during most of this movie.  My husband will not consider pursuing this career after viewing the movie.  The personalities and real time feel of this movie create a sense of sportsmanship and warrior like bonding among the contenders.  Each devotes a crazy amount of time learning all things wine, at the expense of their relationships and marriages, creating a vacuum that can't be filled by anything but more of geography, winecraft, cigars, more study,  more tasting, more assessments of the fruit of the vine, flash cards day and night, peer testing and more testing, every moment day and night, right up to the Master Sommelier Court Exam.  Seen as one of the toughest tests in the world to achieve, this movie moves quickly to cover the highs of success and the anguish of having to wait a year to take the exam again.  I appreciated seeing a mix of people pursuing the craft, I would like more representation by women in this industry, as well as to hear the story of the underbelly a woman might experience becoming a Master Sommelier in Somm II.",1461024000,,1432,4.745967741935484
5787737,3,B00DBVY8YE,"It is a film about the trials and tribulations that candidates for the Master Sommelier undergo in order to pass the, almost impossible, test of tenacity, historical and geographical memory of the European wine regions.

The reason for three stars is that the film portrays the sommeliers as memory robots that automatically spew out wine aroma and taste descriptions appearing to be memorized scripts that come across as arrogant gauche cliches.",1461024000,,446,5.28169014084507

5787756,2,B00DBVY8YE,"For us, this movie started out interesting and engaging, with some interesting perspectives on wine, but quickly became just about the tension of studying and the anxiety about the exam, which is pretty much the same for any major exam, and has nothing to do with wine.  A lot of time and film was spent on the lead up to the exam, and it became slow-paced and repetitive.  The African-American somm seemed interesting and talented, but got very little screen time, especially as the film progressed.  As for the credential itself, it's probably becoming a bit obsolete in a world where so many new wines of quality are being introduced, with new regions and grape varieties coming forward every day.  Historically, the somm knew all the great producers and vintages, how long they should age, and how they should best be matched with food -- but then the prices of those ""historic: wines shot up to millionaire territory.  When it comes to the enormous number of relatively affordable wines, anyone with a decent palate should be able to find interesting food-wine matches, and passing a test on arcane vineyard names, geography, and technical nomenclature won't improve one's skill.  So, basically, this is a movie about studying for and taking a challenging professional certification exam, and doesn't have much to do with love of wine and food.  Reminded me a lot of preparing for and taking the bar exam, which wasn't so entertaining.....  I much prefer movies like Sideways and Bottle Rocket.",1453248000,,1499,4.944223107569721

Unfortunately we could not watch the entire show because our internet connection through Mediacom in Waterloo Iowa continued to cause reloading and then quit altogether.

They have Cedar Falls Utilities and internet through them. Obama visited Cedar Falls because they have an exemplary system. We however have Mediacom and pay dearly. You can be sure I will not go to amazon again to stream a movie. Now we view movies only through Itunes. We download the movie and then watch it.

5787785,3,B00DBVY8YE,"I liked this movie but was disappointed that it did not provide more for me to learn about wine.  If focused on the intensity of the training and preparation of several candidates to pass a three-part exam to become master sommeliers (very elite group of less than 250 world-wide since the testing began 1969).  The movie did a good job of following a group of candidates that joined together as friends to help each other in preparing for the test.  The drama was good but did drag a little.  The theory part of the exam covers a comprehensive range including totally obscure wine regions and sub regions.  The preparation for the tasting part focused on the candidates rapidly spewing out taste characteristics  of the wine that really didn't provide enough insight on the process itself and how one could develop their palate.  In the service section, an established master somm chides a candidate during training on chilling a bottle of red wine.  He went on to say that there was a method to quickly chilling wine but did not elaborate on that method.  It was a compelling drama on the process and it was enjoyable.

5787819,4,B00DBVY8YE,"I like wine. Though I'm no connoisseur (the dilettante wine 'expert' reminds me of Paul Giamatti's character in 'Sideways').
""Somm,"" short for sommelier, is a fascinating look into the word of becoming a Master Sommelier.
Director Jason Wise follows four men, Brian, Ian, DLynn, and Dustin as they prepare for the Court of Sommelier test.
A grueling one at that which involves nearly every aspect of wine from around the globe. They have to know the precise appellation.
Yes, these guys are true wine geeks. The test is all consuming, and takes its toll on each of them personally. The test is given once a year, so preparation involves that much time. Aside from their love of wine, each man has their own personality. Some more likable than others.
The documentary is a bit of a ""horse race"" when it comes down to the wire...who will pass the test, and who will fail?
This isn't a perfect documentary. At times, it dragged. The preparation by each candidate seemed repetitious. Though I guess each man deserved a fair shake at being represented. The photography is well done. The film is an hour and 33 minutes; not that long a film, but could have used a bit of editing. This is the kind of ""small"" documentary that you rarely have a chance to see. It's never in the theater, so it was nice to see this offered here on Amazon.

5787837,3,B00DBVY8YE,"This film was mainly interesting to me because of having been tested and then extensively trained as a sensory panelist (taste/odor judgment). I don't know if it would have been interesting to me otherwise. I did wish it would have gone a little farther in details. For example, I wondered if alcoholism is a temptation or a problem for any of the people in the industry. Several times, a few of them were definitely a bit lit in the film. Do they spit enough of it that they are not really consuming too much? I also wondered if they are tested for taste/odor acuity or not and what sort of testing they undergo. I wondered how many of the six wines they had to name correctly to pass the Master Sommelier test. I was also curious how somebody could have an extremely sensitive palate and still tolerate tasting alcohol since for most people with a high concentration of taste buds, alcohol tastes extremely bitter and vile like rubbing alcohol. So I was curious to know whether these people have an extremely sensitive palate or not or if they do if they had somehow learned to overcome the bitterness of alcohol. I also wondered how many people give up after one or more attempts versus how many keep trying and eventually become masters. I think more incisive delving into the field would have made the film more interesting.",1409356800,4,1329,4.6118143459915615

This short (80 minute or so) documentary follows a small group of Bay Area wine professionals and their studies leading up to the exam.  I found it to be a pretty nice documentary because the folks didn't seem to be too over personified.  A lot of documentaries really edit the show to show people in situations they like, but it seems pretty fair here.  With the exception of a few of the Masters actually helping the others to study.

I admit that much of the reason I enjoyed it was for nostalgia.  I enjoyed seeing Guy Stout a couple of times (he actually administered my Certified exam).  But this documentary is good for two kinds of folks: those in the wine industry who have actually taken or have considered taking any of the certifications from WSET, CMS, or SWE; or those who are interested in wine and want to see a bit of the inside of the wine industry at the highest levels.

Still, I enjoyed this film about four wine enthusiasts who were attempting to be among the elite who are rated as Master Sommeliers.  The film follows their frantic efforts the last few weeks before what has to be the hardest test of which I'm aware.  It was an impressive performance.  I wonder, though, while I have no doubt they know wine better than I do and probably appreciate the nuances better, do I enjoy my wine more than they enjoy their's?",1393113600,,548,4.396039603960396

My biggest disappointment was with the way this film treated women - which was only as the support systems of the men studying for the exam.  Perhaps they asked to follow women as well and no one agreed, however even if that were the case they could have chosen to portray the girlfriends and wives in a different light.  I do understand that women make up a small minority of Master Sommeliers, however I think this film could have done more than to portray it as a boys club.",1389571200,,554,4.411764705882353

5787869,4,B00DBVY8YE,"What should a documentary be? A documentary should be the filmmakers best effort to portray reality - What is it like to prepare for the Master Sommelier exam? What exactly is the Master Sommelier exam, and why should we care about anybody aspiring to take it?

I'm not sure filmmaker Jason Wise fully comprehended his subject, and thus, rather than taking a broad view, he provides us a small portal through which to understand the process of aspiring to be a Sommelier.

I think this film would have been improved by providing the context of exactly what a Sommelier is; what their typical working experience is like, and why some feel inspired to obtain the formal credential of ""Master"". Moreover, little context was provided to help us understand why the particular organization sponsoring the competition has the credibility, clout or ""license"" to hold itself out as worthy to certify ""masters"".

However, my biggest gripe with this film is that Jason Wise (filmmaker) attempts to manipulate the audience in this so called ""objective portrayal of reality"" by subtly pitting, with bias, the laid-back approach of one contestant against the anal retentive approach of another. Wise wants to sucker you into a premature judgment about which approach is going to succeed, so that he can prove you wrong; Wise wants the approach to mastering a subject (and kind of person) Wise prefers vindicated. This is not true journalism - presenting the pertinent facts in an evenhanded manner and letting the viewer decide -, it's the kind of journalism that dominates America today, where the journalist takes upon himself the task of influencing the audience to see the world the way, he the journalist, wants you to see it.

Despite all these egregious flaws I still rate this work as ""good"" (4 stars). If you hold your nose to keep out the stench, you'll find yourself learning something, and entering in the triumphs and disappointments of the contestants. Wise is a decent filmmaker, just not an objective journalist.",1388534400,,2014,5.002985074626865

5787877,3,B00DBVY8YE,"If you love wine or are curious about why people do, I am afraid Somm has very little to offer. If, however,  you are a student of human nature and the peculiar tendency we have to mute all the colors of life into the drab gray tones of vulgar ambition, then this documentary will be of great interest. After the first minute we never again hear much about the wine itself: its sensual beauty, the pleasure it gives to mind and body, all the reasons the story's protagonists were presumably drawn to wine in the first place. Becoming a master sommelier is for each of them no different from any other competitive endeavor. Everything they say or feel about wine could be replaced with another subject entirely. The crucial thing is the adolescent ego drama of the young men at the center of the story, none of whom appears to be too far from the frat house days of his younger years.  So absurd is the whole tale that one feels the filmmaker must have been aware of the underlying ironies. In its best moments the documentary has the feeling of intentional-unintentional satire such as that of Best in Show and A Mighty Wind. Still, it's hard to know if you're laughing at a joke you've been told or if you are telling the joke yourself.",1386201600,,1237,4.469026548672566

5787882,5,B00DBVY8YE,"If you are a knowledgeable wine lover you will most certainly want to, not only see this film, but get the DVD. And, with the holidays coming up as I post this review, I can't think of a better gift to give to that wine-expert friend of yours. It's not only less than a fancy bottle of wine (which may not be to their ""taste"" - pun intended) but you won't pick the wrong wine.

If you are just a casual wine drinker, you may find the 93-minute film a bit slow and repetitive. Since it is following six candidates who are studying to be Master Sommeliers, the fact become repetitive. But if you are really involved in wines this won't bother you.

If you've seen the film (it played many wine film festivals) you will probably still want the DVD for the special features. Three are short: three minutes on the writing of the original film score, a four-minute alternate ending and two-minutes on the photographing of the ""shattering glass"" images used to define the chapters (these seem to really impress a previous reviewer here on Amazon.). Best of all is the ""Sommeliers' Commentary Track"" which gives you another 93 minutes of material.
So, yes, it gets five stars for the knowledgeable wine enthusiast.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
