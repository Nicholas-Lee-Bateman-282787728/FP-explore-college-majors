3778457,5,B001RTKKOO,"I feel Ralphie May is a very Hilarious person and my reasonable purchase from Amazon
was great too. You can't beat two great things for one great price. Very funny and cheap for the money...",1268524800,2,190,4.457142857142857
3778458,5,B001RTKKOO,This guy is too funny laughed just about the entire time. Not kid friendly (not R though) but didn't really expect it to be. Will be picking up more of his dvds,1265846400,4,160,4.03125
3778459,4,B001RTKKOO,I saw this performance on Comedy Central and I just had to find it to share with my family.  Ralphie May is crazy funny.  He doesn't hold anyback no matter the subject or race.  If you are looking for a good laugh you migh want to check this out.,1265846400,2,246,3.979591836734694
3778460,5,B001RTKKOO,"I have seen some of Ralphie's other material, and have to admit that his Austin-tatious dvd is extremely funny.  He uses language that is not politically correct or even close.  He amuses the audience with jokes about his weight and even about his wife.  One of the only things I did not enjoy was the switching from color to black and white.  It was unneeded for the dvd.",1265760000,4,372,4.426470588235294
3778461,5,B001RTKKOO,"BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Ralphie May is so HILLARIOUS, your side won't stop hurting.

O.J.",1264982400,2,87,5.615384615384615
3778462,4,B001RTKKOO,"Very funny and uses his size as a crutch ,to address many things commom in todays society.",1264809600,,90,4.352941176470588
3778463,5,B001RTKKOO,"Just have to say I enjoyed this new dvd, ALL NEW material and taped in Texas (natch) from where Ralphie got his start.  If you like to laugh you'll love this Ralphie special.  I highly recommend it.",1251417600,2,198,4.324324324324325
3778474,5,B001RTKKOO,"DVD is good, but he needs work on his timing.",1424563200,,45,3.6
3778475,4,B001RTKKOO,"Ralphie May is a talented comedian.  Keeps you laughing, so more than one viewing is necessary to catch the parts you didn't hear the first time.",1390694400,,145,4.576923076923077
3778476,5,B001RTKKOO,The Fat Man is just plain HILARIOUS. I plan on buying any Ralphie May DVD I can get my hands on.,1385856000,,96,3.619047619047619
3778477,5,B001RTKKOO,"I think no matter what your humor you're into you can appreciate this performance. This is my favorite of his that I've seen. He's a lot less dynamic than other comedians in that he doesn't (or can't) work the stage the way I really like but his jokes hit so hard that becomes irrelevant. Whether you're a collector of stand-up or just need some entertainment for a nice Saturday afternoon, this is it.",1368403200,,402,4.52054794520548
3778478,4,B001RTKKOO,I just love the Ralphie. It's funny on different nights in different parts of the video. Can't wait for him to do another large venue!,1356912000,,134,4.4
3778479,5,B001RTKKOO,I purchase this for my nephew and he is very satisfied he has not watched it yet.  I will add more when he does.  This came when expected and in excellent condition.,1356480000,,165,4.125
3778480,5,B001RTKKOO,"I enjoyed Ralphie May no nonsense,  non-political correct humor. He keeps it real. The humor will keep you entertained for hours.",1354579200,,129,5.142857142857143
3778481,3,B001RTKKOO,Still one of the funnist people on the circuit although this wasn't one of his best. Guess I don't care for comedy based on their childern. Just to much.,1293840000,,153,4.310344827586207
3778482,1,B001RTKKOO,"I saw Ralphie May on last comic standing and thought he was great. This DVD only has a few good laughs. It's mostly dirty, which I wouldn't mind if the jokes were at least funny, but they're not.",1284076800,2,195,4.157894736842105
3778483,5,B001RTKKOO,"Ralphie May is politically incorrect and sure to offend somebody, which I respect. Unique and over the top humor but always with an underlying element of truth. He's crude, vulgar, and funny as hell. There is no comedian on earth like him who can say, do, and get away with it, always with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes! My hubby and I have all his DVDs, which we've seen way more than once ... so please, keep it coming!",1283040000,2,425,4.325
