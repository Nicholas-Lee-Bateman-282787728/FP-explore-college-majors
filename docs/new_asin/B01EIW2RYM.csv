Hope there will be second season
Worth the price in comparison to the not save which cost double",1476489600,2,110,4.55
7736227,4,B01EIW2RYM,"Fantastic show!

The ONLY issue I had with it was it was far too short.  13 episodes.  But what a ride those 13 episodes are...

I can't recommend this Anime high enough.",1474156800,4,170,4.21875

7736229,5,B01EIW2RYM,I truly enjoyed this anime. It makes you think about life and makes you view world issues in a different light. Money is the root of all evil.,1471132800,3,142,4.107142857142857

8758830,5,B01EIW2RYM,"It was actually a very enjoyable show. There was a tad bit much use of CGI which can be a bit distracting, but overall enjoyable to watch. I'd like to compare anime to Snickers, since this is a 12 episode or below series (this has 11 episodes) it's like a bite sized Snicker. The small shows seem to always be the best.

The discs and box came in good shape.

And yes, the green SAVE spine of the cover is obtrusive, however like most Funimation covers, this one is also reversible.
If you have lots of SAVE DVD boxes, then putting them next to each other doesn't look so bad for your collection.",1501718400,,596,4.265486725663717

8758832,5,B01EIW2RYM,"Excellent anime with a deeper meaning. At first blush this is a typical avatar battle anime, but they hint at the depth early on regarding the true meaning of money. The character development is fairly well done and as a whole the main protagonist becomes likeable as he grows into himself.
Spoiler alert:

The black money isn't necessarily ""evil"" money, but is essentially fiat currency that is created by the central banks to prop up economies. Virtually all global economies engage in this, and there are some good YouTube videos that explain this in depth, including ones why the Japanese economy is doomed in the long run if interest due ever surpassed the tax income. The ""future"" that disappears is pointing to the destitution that will result in the event of a failed economy. It's akin to someone who's living off of a credit card spending more than they make. Eventually there is a tipping point where it is literally impossible to pay it back unless you eliminate spending and have a massive increase in income. This cripples your credit score, causes asset repossession and other debilitating results.
The show also points to stock market manipulation through publishing of false news stories tied to analyst reviews, etc. This anime manages to cover the hazards of the modern financial market in an excellent allegory. I highly recommend this anime, and is well worth the $20 I paid for it. I think it will have a high replay value for me as well.",1496188800,,1460,4.816733067729084
8758833,3,B01EIW2RYM,"Well as far as the story goes it has a good storyline that makes you guess on what is going on. The video was made for kids but, its really for adults to watch and, understand. This is more of a drama with a bad ending to understand.",1494633600,,233,3.875
8758834,4,B01EIW2RYM,"The jump cuts are annoying. But the animation is otherwise good. There's a bit of fanservice. The Japanese voice acting is good, and so is the story. It's an anime that turns the financial into battles. It's different from what I've seen, with plenty of colorful characters and designs. The changes in the past and present,  and the fixation on the future make it interesting, along with the interaction and development or revelations. It can be a bit sad at times, especially as the results are revealed. Money is certainly evil stuff.",1486771200,,536,4.826086956521739
8758835,4,B01EIW2RYM,"Great show, but while it shows action and reaction in the economy, it doesn't do a good job of explaining why the reactions are a given - would be p helpful to watch this parallel to an economics class.",1481500800,,202,4.205128205128205
