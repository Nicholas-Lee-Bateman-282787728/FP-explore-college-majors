3076550,3,B00124SNKC,"This highly enjoyable ""legal eagles"" series features several of my favorite stalwarts from British TV and film over the years, John Hannah (of ""McCallum"" and ""The Mummy"" fame), Penny Downie (PD James's Adam Dalgliesh series), and Paul Freeman (everyone's favorite cheerful villain - he was the suave, unprincipled anthropologist in the Indiana Jones movies), as well as a group of other British TV stars that I am just getting to know through this series.

One interesting aspect of the show is that it opens a window on the differences between the American and British justice systems.  And, while most American cop/legal shows focus on catching the bad guys and prosecuting them, this series is weighted toward the other side: the efforts of the defense to ensure that the alleged (sometimes actual) perps, many of whom are poor and/or of color, get a fair shake in court.

This set is Season Two, and it was quite as enjoyable as Season One, which I also own.  Set in Manchester (which, like Liverpool and Newcastle, is no longer just another gritty, grimy, English industrial city), the show follows the opposing careers of two barristers. In the UK a barrister is a trial lawyer, as opposed to a ""solicitor"", a private lawyer who doesn't do trial work.  Jack Roper (John Hannah), is a defense lawyer, while Lawrence Scammel (Paul Freeman), is what we would call the public prosecutor who acts on behalf of the state to get the perps sent up. There is more to their rivalry than mere courtroom oneupmanship: Roper was once a member of Scammel's chambers and one of his most promising protegees.  Roper's defection to the defense and setting up of his own chambers hurt Scammel and his wife and daughter, also prosecution barristers, who felt that Roper had betrayed them.  Scammel and Roper, and the junior members of their opposing chambers, meet in court regularly, and it's a battle of wits to win the hearts and minds of judges and juries.  Child molesters, hookers, rapists, con men and women, pickpockets - all find representation in Roper's chambers.  It is also very interesting to see the interplay among judges and barristers in British courts, where things that we would not allow are allowed, and vice-versa - for example, the police (who are not portrayed too sympathetically) bugging the holding cell of one of Roper's clients, and being able to use what they hear to get Roper arrested.

Outside the weekly legal battles, of course, the members of chambers, each with his own well-written character, wreck their marriages, have affairs, and try to protect Roper from his real worst enemy: himself, and his penchant for a certain recklessness, both in court and out of it.

The writing, as is often the case with British shows, is tight and adult.  All the characters, not just the two primary ones, are nicely fleshed out and evolve along with the show, and there is a cultural diversity among the characters that has a wonderful ""taken for granted"" feel, rather than the politically correct feel that such diversity often has in American shows.  The actors are terrific, with special mention going to Freeman and Downie for their portrayal of a complicated marriage of mature professionals who must work together.

As these episodes build on what has gone before, I would recommend seeing Season One first - for Americans unfamiliar with the British courts, it can be a bit confusing figuring out the rules that dictate some of the behavior.  Season Two is much more enjoyable if you have Season One under your belt.

The last episode of each set ends with an unresolved cliffhanger, so I am already anxiously awaiting Season Three - and that, of course, is an emphatic recommendation!",1219795200,2,3705,4.894568690095847
3076551,5,B00124SNKC,"As a trial attorney in the U.S. I have seen/watched every legal drama series on TV, both US and Britain.  Without question, New Street Law is the best that has yet to come along! It's hard to select which feature stands out the most..............the acting is superb; the plots and the actual trial cases are not only realistic,they are clever,fantastic,and keep your attention at all times.  The interaction between the characters is outstanding, and each character is very well developed.  The plots are very well written, and combine interesting facts as well as significant ethical issues which are handled extremely well.  Along with the marvelous drama, there was appropriate humor.  Americans have the added interesting aspect of seeing the Solicitor/Barrister system up close.  How can they possibly intend to stop after only the two series??  This is the quality of television that comes along rarely,and should be encouraged and expanded, not abruptly ended.  SURELY THERE WILL BE A SEASON THREE??!!??",1215216000,11,1011,5.275
3076552,4,B00124SNKC,"This second season of New Street Law had lots of twists and turns--just as one would expect after the first season.

3076553,5,B00124SNKC,"Ok I got hooked after the first episode of season one. It is no Rumpole with tales and events but down to earth look at issues facing Britain and Europe in their quest for a united EEC. A purely British way of looking at themselves from within their continuously changing society. The humor is extremely complex, politically incorrect and very adult. It questions the established conventions with needs or reasoning of right or wrong. What is right and what is wrong and who determines which? The talent is British actors and actresses at their finest. The characters are as complex as the issues, but are presented as individuals with individual problems, both at work and in their personal lives. Surprisingly there are no weak characters in line up or the cast. This kind of drama is not my cup of tea so to speak. So I was completely surprised and pleased with this wonderful series. I am looking forward to season three.",1209772800,4,925,4.716049382716049
