By keeping the audience's contribution mostly to the crackling of the ice in the background, the piece seems to maintain a sense of control and I would imagine the audience members still have a sense of engagement.  However, I can't imagine the users have a high sense of agency seeing as their noise generation is lost in the vast interconnected web of others around them. , although the interconnection is a strong central theme of the piece.  The performers contributions to the piece are incredible at setting the mood.  The whale calls of the instruments and singers in ""You sink into the singing snow"" were phenomenal at imitating the sounds of the arctic world.  The accompanying visuals were also very successful in giving a sense of how rapidly this environmental change is occurring.  Overall, I found the piece to be incredible at not only creating the atmosphere of the northern icey region, but demonstrating the sense of change through its interactive and dynamic elements.",1385769600,,1101,5.021978021978022
8616022,5,B00FGX58XA,"I found this piece to be extremely interesting on both a sonic and visual level.  I thought the musical accompaniment melded quite well with the imagery in that the mix of dissonance and harmony between the music and vocal provided a very apt sonic personification for the melting icecaps  the music seemed to flow around the singing portions of the piece as water flowed around the blocks of ice shown in the visual portions.  Additionally, including the audience in the performance was a great metaphor for how small alterations on an individual level could amount to grand environmental changes in totality.  The interactivity with the audience throughout the whole piece added a unique facet to the performance and, in my mind, enhanced the depth of the piece.  Also adding substance to the performance were the narrative breaks.  I found the portion in which all oceans were detailed to be part of one great body of water to be very much in keeping with the theme of the rest of the piece and I thought it fit well into the scheme of the whole performance.  The complimentary combination of both visual and musical stimuli was a main reason I found this piece to be so interesting.",1385769600,,1186,4.7560975609756095
8616023,5,B00FGX58XA,"Auksalaq was an incredibly eye-opening and unfamiliar experience. Strongly supported by various media, the opera performance spans several disciplines of media, each in a heartfelt and interconnected way. What made this opera so unique was its emphasis on audience participation. By taking advantage of technologies and harnessing them for communal use, the NOMAD program crossed the boundary between audience and performer, an undefined line that is always in motion. Motivating these thematic elements was the underlying environmental cause in raising awareness about climate change and its effect on the Arctic. The Arctic regions are mysterious, and while I have not lived there nor even visited, Auksalaq has a way of making this story of preservation personal through various narratives as well as the musical component, especially the hands playing in water. It is as if you can feel the ice cracking and melting beneath your feet with every step, making the responsibility of preservation all the more personal and thought provoking.",1385769600,,1041,5.472049689440993
