8406210,5,B003UVCDJC,"Because of my high level of interest in wet flies, and English wet fly patterns, I really enjoyed this CD, and I learned some new to me fly tying techniques.",1441670400,,157,4.266666666666667
8406211,5,B003UVCDJC,"I opened this DVD as a novice tyer who did not know how to tie a wet fly at all.  Davy Wotton teaches the wet fly broken down into its parts, tailing the fly, building the body, ribbing the fly,  hackles and wings. The techniques are old school;  they produce strong and beautiful flies.  After watching this, I practiced the techniques.  Now, great looking and extremely effective wet flies  in infinite variety are as close as my tying vise.  You can't get these flies in most fly shops. I found that repeat viewings of this DVD revealed even more to me.  The patterns he presents fish amazingly well, especially the ""Black and Silver Spider"" and the ""Hare's Ear and Woodcock.""  I can now tie any fly from recipes in old books such as A. Courtney Williams ""A Dictionary of Trout Flies"".  I love the fact that you don't need an indicator to fish a cast of three wet flies;  that allows me to enjoy the surroundings much more.  Any one who wants to investigate this ancient, rewarding and effective fishing method should pick up this set of DVDs.  I have purchased several to share with my friends, who can't believe the success they have with the wet flies they tied.",1424476800,,1168,4.504761904761905
