Roslyn (Joanna Going) had no redeeming qualities and it was hard to sympathize with her. Overly sexy, not enough personality. Holly Golightly she is not. I'm a huge fan of Brendan Fraser but he just played a goof in this film.

After one 'city-bad-guy' scene, the rest was thankfully a mellow character study with a mystical side. I enjoyed Brendan Fraser in this film. Sometimes he looked like a bum when he first woke up, say, then other times he was quite handsome. I found him likeable throughout the movie. She was very beautiful and I enjoyed watching her tough and vulnerable sides. It left you a bit on edge at times, wondering 'is this guy a going to turn into a psycho or is he just unusual and intuitive?' He didn't show psychosis at all, you just felt a bit of curious wondering if he could be, just due to his strange ways, as the story unraveled. I liked the spattering of short dream sequences in the film. Was personally glad this movie didn't dive into being a thriller; instead it had a heart. Loved the quirky uniqueness, the (not dark) artistic flare of this love story, her unexpected chemistry toward him and the mystical flavor of this film.

STILL BREATHING
(Romantic comedy, color, PG-13,1:48)

BY JOE LEYDON

AUSTIN, Texas (Variety) - First-time feature filmmaker James F. Robinson strikes just the right note of romantic
whimsy in ""Still Breathing,"" a light and bright romantic comedy about an ingenuous young Texan's attempts to woo a beautiful con woman who is, quite literally, the woman of his dreams.

Appealing performances by Brendan Fraser and Joanna Going add to the fun in a pic that, with clever marketing, could score respectable B.O. [box office returns] before finding an even bigger audience on cable and cassette.
Fraser is well cast as Fletcher, a dreamy-eyed eccentric who lives in San Antonio and works, sporadically, as a puppeteer and street performer. As pic begins, Fletcher is haunted by visions of a beautiful woman he's never met. For most folks, this might be frightening. But Fletcher accepts it as his fate as a McBracken: for generations, each male member of the family has dreamed of his eventual wife long before making her acquaintance.

In one especially disturbing vision, however, Fletcher sees his ""dream girl"" brutally dealing with a would-be mugger. (The capper to this brief sequence is a genuine hoot.) Turns out that, in the real world, Rosalyn (Going), the object of Fletcher's unconscious affections, is a cynical L.A. con artist who makes a reasonably prosperous living by bilking would- be suitors in an art scam.

Early in ""Still Breathing,"" Rosalyn convinces a wealthy Argentine (Paolo Seganti) to pay a ridiculously inflated price for a painting she admires. (The art gallery owner is part of the sting.) Afterward, she rids herself of the smitten fellow by planting evidence to suggest she has AIDS.

The latter development might have come across as unacceptably crude if Going weren't able to convey a hint of long-dormant vulnerability in Rosalyn. In conversations with her mentor, Elaine (Ann Magnuson), Rosalyn admits that she is reaching the point of total burnout as an amoral manipulator. Even so, she's willing to try yet another sting, and Elaine promises to set her up with a ""rich Texan.""

Meanwhile, back in San Antonio, Fletcher has another dream, one that tells him he will find the love of his life in Formosa. So he drops everything and books a flight to China. During an L.A. stopover, however, he learns about a trendy bar named Formosa, and decides to check out the place. Naturally, that's where he sees Rosalyn, who's waiting for her latest mark. One thing leads to another, thanks to misinterpreted signals and mistaken assumptions, and complications ensue.

Much to her surprise and discomfort, Rosalyn finds herself growing genuinely fond of Fletcher. She even agrees to return with him to San Antonio, where he introduces her to his beloved Aunt [sic] Ida (Celeste Holm) and his equally eccentric friends. The road to true love hits a speed bump when Fletcher spills the beans about his visions, and Rosalyn learns he really isn't the millionaire she assumed. But this delays the happily-ever-after ending for only a few scenes.

Fraser is winning in a tricky role that calls for him to be at once engagingly innocent and nobody's fool. In one very funny scene, Fletcher listens with steadily mounting annoyance to an L.A. smoothie's condescending remarks about Texas. When he can take no more, he devastates the guy with some well-aimed put-downs that likely will elicit cheers and applause from many audiences. Going, too, has to strike a challenging balance in her performance, and she is every bit as successful. Early on, it's revealed that the seemingly hard-bitten Rosalyn has been distracted by her own golden-lit dreams. Going is extremely deft at revealing flashes of romantic yearning beneath her character's tough facade. Just as Fletcher brings out the best in Rosalyn, Going and Fraser bring out the best in each other.

In addition to Holm and Magnuson, the fine supporting cast includes Angus MacFadyen as the art-gallery owner who gets his comeuppance from Fletcher, and Michael McKean as an arrogant businessman who brings out Rosalyn's predatory side. Lou Rawls gets prominent billing for playing the Tree Man, one of Fletcher's colorful San Antonio friends, but apparently much of his performance was left on the cutting-room floor.

Robinson allows his story to unfold at an aptly leisurely pace. But he is annoyingly fuzzy about a few key details. It's never entirely clear whether Fletcher is well-to-do or near- impoverished. He may be just a street performer -- and, occasionally, a collage artist -- but he seems to have more than enough money to maintain a large house and pay for impulsive trips to China. Even fairy tales should pay more attention to such details.

Attractively lensed on San Antonio and Los Angeles locations by John Thomas (Barcelona), ""Still Breathing"" sustains its warmly romantic tone with offhanded ease without ever turning silly or syrupy. The impressively eclectic musical score includes everything from operatic excerpts to Texas swing to ""Harlem Nocturne."" At one point, Holm plays the tuba with a small ensemble for a pleasingly jazzy version of Chopin's Berceuse. Like many other things in ""Still Breathing,"" the number works much better than you would ever suspect.",1407456000,,5275,5.128055878928987

I had come across this story several years ago and was very pleased to be able to enjoy it again in DVD format.  It is such a fun and quirky love story that warms the heart, touches the soul, and brings a big smile to your face.  Our hero is so lovable and inspiring, that you just can't help rooting for him to win the girl who has something much different than love on her mind when she first meets him and tries to swindle him on a bogus art deal.  But in the end she finds that she saves her own life on so many levels thanks to this ""chase"" encounter,  Just a delightful love story for all us hopeless romantics!",1383004800,6,747,4.089041095890411

1373303,5,B00004YA1G,"It's always odd when a movie shown often on cable suddenly becomes hard to acquire. I attribute this to licensing issues between producers, studios, and such.
I would have bought the Region 1 version of this movie, but the prices are totally unreasonable. I have one Chinese made DVD player (a COBY model), which plays pretty much any region, so I took a chance and got the Region 2 version of this film. To my surprise, when I loaded the disc into my computer where I often watch films, it played without issues. Odd.

My computer DVD drive, which I installed several years ago, came with Nero-7/PowerDVD-7 software. Usually, when I try to play a Region 2 disc it will not play with this combo.
But, this disc did. I don't know if that would be the case for other users.

When the disc starts, it is in letter-boxed 4:3 format (full screen height), which is achieved by cutting the left/right ends off. Also by default, the film runs in English but with Dutch subtitles. At first, I thought these settings were unalterable, but when I opened the full control menu for my PowerDVD player, I was able to switch off the subtitles and adjust the picture for a 16:9 format. My PowerDVD player allowed me to adjust aspect ratio and ""stretch"" for proper appearance. These required adjustments to manually overide the default settings are unusual. A peculiar disc. The picture quality is pretty good. A little grainy but with good color saturation and brightness. All in all, I feel I got a nice deal on this disc. My only concern is that my experience with successful Region 2 playback might not be enjoyed by others.",1365724800,2,1611,4.629370629370629

When I'm blue, it instantly raises my spirits.  It doesn't hurt that the movie takes place in San Antonio, TX, which is where I spent my childhood summers with family.  I get totally lost in the plot, and Brendan is at his absolute sexiest ever in this flick.  I highly, HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who enjoys romance, comedy, and a bit of mystery.",1311638400,2,504,4.319148936170213
1373310,5,B00004YA1G,"This is my favorite movie of all time.  It is such a beautiful, warm and romantic story, that it will leave you breathless.  The unconditional love expressed by Fletcher is so heart-warming that you fall in love with him even as Rosalyn maintains her hard-edge.

The dreams that draw them to one another are so sweet and gentle, they are the crowning touch to a wonderful romantic tale.  The children are absolutely darling, and the river adds to the dreamy quality.

Beyond that, the film just wraps you in the beauty and warmth of San Antonio and Fletcher's eccentric style.  Such a beautiful and touching movie.  It is a shame that it was not better advertised when it was originally released.

If you have even one slightly romantic bone in your body, you want to see this movie.  Buy it, rent it, do whatever you have to do to see this.  You won't regret it.",1298678400,9,863,4.509677419354839

As a Actor he is wonderfull, has all kinds of faces...once I watch one I think is ""the Gods""..I can't remember the actual title, but even though he was great, I just could not see him in that way..so I decided I was not ever going to watch him in any sad, or him being bad cause that is not how I saw him since day one. My first movie was ""THE ENCINO MAN"", that is when I sat and laugh, even if it was corny, this movie but him aside and from there on I saw him in other funny but even better as he became a great well known actor. I love all his mummy's movie that movie was just awsome I have all of them and the emperor too. Now the movie ""STILL BREATHING"" WAS JUST WONDERFULL , EMOTIONAL, ROMANTIC, FUNNY MOVIE I love it because it was about a girl who was lost in romance and did not know where she was heading too with her not so nice of a jop...(no I'm not telling lol.) anyway she meets accitentaly with this man who shows her the way to trust and love...but this I will say...they had met while still little babies in heaven, to then meet in earth, they are soulmates.

1373326,3,B00004YA1G,"STILL BREATHING, will be an acquired taste for many people, or
better appreciated by those who are fascinated by the game of
seduction between humans. It may be a bore for others with a
smaller attention span or perhaps a touching picture for the
right kind of audience, of chick flicks perhaps.

It fully succeeds in its aims, of establishing an inner peace,
calling attention to being in touch with one's own inner child
or innocence, and emphasizes the human and social aspects of
people, vs the physical, intellectual, for example.

The strong point of this picture, is the strong visual component
that is appealing, the calmness and peacefulness that also
characterized Brendan Fraser's appearance in an earlier movie,
PASSION OF DARKLY NOON. As such, the script appears to have been
tailor-ordered, custom fitted, made to order for Fraser, who
reprises his role as a low-key, in-control, modest, unambitious
man who seeks out the more artistic, introspective aspects that
life has to offer, as his central goal.

Both Joanna Going and Ann Magnuson are amusing in their rapport
with Fraser's character, bringing their own personality and
strong style to the visual aspects of the movie, contributing to
the appeal to audience coupled with some soft piano numbers over
the 90 mins of the movie, and some percussion or horn numbers,
too, forming the soundtrack.

It's a time-travel for viewers, until a certain point, at which
Going's character reveals her secret, that she is a grifter,
playing rich or modestly wealthy single men for their cash, in
exchange for the illusion of romance or of a personal
relationship. At that juncture, the movie seems to slow down
considerably, and the script becomes perhaps over-worked,
over-intellectualized, overwhelming viewers with a flood of
literary, musical, and visual artwork aspects. By thrusting
these onto the audience, the viewers are drawn back out of the
story and into their reality again, from the boredom, and those
excesses.

As a rental, this is a good movie. As a theatrical release, it
will have its moments. Seeing Fraser squirm to deliver
entertainment is worth the price of the ticket alone, much like
trying to fit a square peg into a round hole, because he does
succeed in pulling off the acting successfully.",1270166400,4,2276,5.058666666666666

1373330,5,B00004YA1G,"Everything about Still Breathing is comfort--characters, pacing, plot, music, and actors.  Funny, heartwarming, and true on many levels.  I highly recommend the soundtrack as well.

Fraser portrays Fletcher, a talented and well-established street performer from San Antonio with an unusual family hobby (building cairns) and an unusual family trait (clairvoyant dreaming).  When Fletcher dreams about a woman with large eyes and dark hair being assaulted on a city street, he knows he has pictured his soul mate--only he doesn't know where she is.  He sets out on a journey to find her, and when he does, she is hardly ready to meet her true love.

Cynical and jaded, Roz (Joanna Going's con-artist) seduces Fletcher with amazing ease because she believes him to be a Texas oil tycoon.  She thinks she has everything under control until she starts dreaming about herself as a child with a sweet young boy, dreams that have an unsettling affect on her well-ordered life.  By the time she learns that she was mistaken about Fletcher's wealth, she has been changed in ways she can't undo.

And he laughed, and asked me if I'd seen this movie -- ""Still Breathing.""  ""It was like that,"" he said.  He wouldn't say any more than that.  Instead, he just told me to watch this movie.  And, I, being curious, went to the movie rentals to find it.  When I watched it, I couldn't imagine the plot to be anything but implausible.  Did my friend really think this movie to be realistic -- so realistic that he claims this is how he found his wife?  I didn't think so, but Celeste Holm's scene with Joanna Going made me realize why I didn't believe it.  This movie gave me some blissful months of hope, in that lonely space of time when a romantic is feeling hopeless.  And by the next year, my true love found me too.  Strangely enough, we moved to Texas, and we've since gone tubing near San Marcos.  This movie is analogous to the Marfa lights of Texas.  I wouldn't have believed it, if my friend hadn't told me it happened to him first, and I saw it for myself.",1184371200,2,1108,4.239234449760765

Joanna Going gives a flawless performance as a jaded and hardened Los Angeles scam artist who secretly yearns to be loved. Fraser, the only weak link in the movie, plays the Texan who has a vision of Going and predictably melts her by the end.

1373344,5,B00004YA1G,"I saw this movie in 2000 in TV and immediately bought it. Since then, I have seen it multiple times and always discovered something new. The first time director, James Cameron, has done an amazing job in the movie. He has thought of a lot of small details and used his contacts to get an amazing cast. Brandon Fraser was OK, but it was Joanna Going and Celeste Holm that do an amazing job. It was called a chick flick, but I personally found a lot of parts that I personally could relate to. The music pieces from Chopin to La Traviata to Blues pieces were well mixed in the movie. I also found the pieces in San Marcos river with the little children very charming. Though the movie may not have outstanding screenplay, the camera work was lovely. Ann Magnusen was superb as the hard headed con woman who is Joanna's friend. I liked the first half more than the second half. It was hilarious to see how Joanna gets rid of the person, Paolo Seganti, whom she cheats with the help of Angus Macfadyen. The painting that she wishes to buy is so bad.

Some dialogs that are beautiful are when Joanna says that, ""My world is about greed and money and ambition and successes."" To this Fraser replies, ""The basic human desires. That is funny because my opinion of art is that it is about truth and beauty and redefining an imperfect world in a perfect way."" The initial part where he creates a portrait of Joanna and shows it to his friends and they completely understand it is excellent. It is almost as though they are a cult of people who live in a separate world. The music pieces and its mixing is outstanding. The parts where they have the band in the party with the tuba version of Chopin is lovely. The original music by Paul Mills is also superb. The camera work with Joanna is the dark is also special. Another special piece is the games Joanna and Fraser play with each other. There are multiple purposes to this movie, it took me a while to understand them and appreciate them. The initial one of finding true love is the obvious one, the ones underneath are also special. These include making a cynic appreciate the beauty in the world, forgiveness and so on. Overall a very scripted movie that was delightful, it took my breath away. It makes me understand the fact that a really satisfying movie does not require a lot of money to be spent on, just good thought, good cast and imaginative story with good direction.

1373346,5,B00004YA1G,"This movie is beauty captured in one story about true love and the lengths it will go to be found and recognized.

Still breathing is probally one of the most romantic and lovely romance stories that I have ever watched. Brendan Fraser is touching as an innocent man in love with a beautiful woman who is twisting and using him to suit her will. Until she finds to her shock that she has fallen for him, bringing about Brendan's prediction that she is really a sweet and caring woman, just burned by the worlds harsh views and demands. You don't have to look far to find the love in this movie, it stares right at you from the moment this wonderful movie begins, to its sad heartbreaking end.",1113264000,6,692,4.40625
1373347,5,B00004YA1G,"First time director James F. Robinson gives us a rare treat - a beautiful romance that both men and women can enjoy.  I remember going to see this film when it was in theaters.  I was totally surprised by the soundtrack, script and characters.  The director showed off San Antonio and LA in their best colors, and created a soundtrack that is a real keeper.

The story is about a woman con artist (Joanna Goings) who has given up on love and a performance artist (Brendan Fraser) who only believes in unconditional love.  They collide in their nightly dreams (before they even meet) and in their waking hours.  Both characters and their friends are true to form.

Brendan Fraser's family and friends are really out there artistically, and Joanna Goings associates are out and out thieves.  The transformation Joanna goes through to finally accept unconditional love and ultimately accept herself in a relationship with Brendan Fraser is truly heartwarming.

This is a movie to be savored on a rainy day when you are curled up on the couch alone or with your honey.  Be forewarned.  Once you get the movie, you will want the original movie soundtrack.  The heady slow mix of jazz and sweet classical music is downright intoxicating.

1373349,5,B00004YA1G,"This is a warm, sweet film. Like many others, I saw it, quite by accident, on cable. I've since bought the DVD and am not disappointed. This small, independent film by James F.Robinson is brilliant in concept and delivery. Right off the bat, there are repeated references to Verdi's ""La Traviata"", the ultimate romantic tragic opera. Things only get better, smarter and more clever. Brendon Fraser is always charming, with his child-like wish for perfection; the rest of the cast handles their roles with aplomb; Ann Magnusen is hard as nails, Tobe Huss as Cameron is the perfect innocent friend, and the great Celeste Holm is there as the granny, delivering the best line in the film: ""(He's) redefining an imperfect world in a perfect way"". She's crazy as a fox, and totally endearing. The mind-blowing element here is the performance of Joanna Going as Roz, the object of the whole thing. She is perfection...centered and precise in every glance, nuance and delivery. I was very impressed. She deserves a better career, since I haven't really heard of her since. A real talent. The choices of music are also excellent, in addition to the original music of Paul Mills. A rendering of ""The Wee Small Hours of the Morning"" (performed by Madeleine Peyroux) is most effecive, as well as the final title song, sung by Rita Springer. This is a loving display of (almost) craziness, lovingly presented by a fine director and a stellar cast. Cynics among you may not agree, but there are still a few of us out here that think true love is possible. Also, stay tuned...after the credits are over, there's a dilightful little ""stinger"". What a fine film! UPDATE: 12-12-06... I just checked this out to buy a copy for a friend. I can't believe it's not available without paying over $100.

There may not be many cute romantic moments to ""aww..."" over, but there are moments of beauty that leave you feeling refreshed...literally, I think that's the best word to describe it.

As a Texan I'm proud of this film because it suggests that not everyone in the state is a loudmouth blowhard.  It also shows
that you don't find mountains in the background in most parts of
Texas.
This is certainly an atypical Brendan Frasier film, but it shows his acting ability.  He seems to be a cross between Jimmy Stewart and Hugh Grant with a gentle and humerous philosophy of life, and a Don Johnson stubble.  Perhaps the lifestyle is a little too laid-back to be credible but it's a kick to see the hero as a musician/street who sometimes plays in a band with his grandmother on tuba.
It is a sweet, good-hearted film, which accentuates the crass personality that is the starting place for our heroine, Goins.
I ran across this film on cable and my wife loved it so much that I had to buy both the soundtrack and the DVD.  It remains my own personal favorite Brendan Frasier film, and I'm not particularly a fan of ""love stories"".  However, the enjoyment of picking out locations in San Antonio, the unique music, and the endearing performances break down my reserves about the genre.",1006214400,16,1158,4.548076923076923

I had never seen Joanna Going before, but after this film, I seek out her other work.  Toby Huss is marvelous in a supporting role, and so is Lou Rawls.  Lastly, the incandescent Celeste Holm, to whom we are treated so rarely, glows as the grandmother.

First, I find the story cornball. There are significant holes in the plot. And the dialogue *is* unremarkable sometimes cliched.
On the plus side, it *looks* great. The cast is wonderful. It is very *sensual* without being explicit--or even very suggestive! The people who made it believed in it implicitly. But most of all there is Joanna Going's deeply affecting performance, by turns coquettish, scheming, vulnerable, frightened, ""bewitched, bothered, and bewildered.""
Whatever its deficiencies, I cannot turn away from a movie with such heart. It shares a place in my heart next to ""Floundering.""
N.B. There is nothing in terms of language or sex that should give offense. But *this* is still an film for adults. (Adolescents can only fully enjoy (if at all) with there parents away!)

Then, as she begins to lower her guard and embrace  Fletcher's quirky but honest Texas lifestyle, her worst fears are indeed  confirmed: Fletcher is truly no more than a humble eccentric, and couldn't  possibly be the love of her life.

1373378,5,B00004YA1G,"I love this film... my words don't do it justice -- here is a review my friend sent me:
Sometimes a movie possesses such a quiet beauty that it  casts a spell on you while you're watching.  ""Still Breathing,""  the debut of writer-director Jim Robinson, is such a film, a romantic  comedy that stands the genre on its ear. It's a movie filled not with jokey  concepts or inane banter but with grace and charm and two wonderful  performances from leads Brendan Fraser and Joanna Going. To call it a great  date movie would limit its accomplishment. It's a great movie, period.  ""Still Breathing"" follows Fletcher McBracken (Fraser), a San  Antonio street musician who has inherited a unique family trait. His  grandfather and father both had visions of the women they were to marry and  then went out and found them. Fletcher waits for his moment, too, cutting  out and piecing together eyes and noses and faces from various magazine  photos, trying to come up with a composite of his future bride.
Then one  night while sleeping on the piano(it helps make the visions clearer),  Fletcher sees her  The One  in a dream, and what he sees isn't good.  She's being mugged by a guy with a gun. He also visualizes the word  ""Formosa,"" a clue to his love's location.
The woman Fletcher  sees in his dream seems an unlikely match. Roz Willoughby (Going), a  cynical L.A. con artist, has been burned by love so often that she's  decided to make a living out of cheating would-be suitors. She and gal-pal  Elaine (Ann Magnuson) scam insincere lotharios by leading them on and then  making them buy worthless art to prove their intentions. They split the  money, the guys get the bum's rush. Fletcher comes to Los Angeles to catch  an international flight to the island of Formosa, believing that is where  he'll find Ms. Right. While he's waiting for his plane, he notices a woman  paging through a tourism brochure that includes a picture of the famous  Formosa Cafe in Hollywood. Fletcher puts two and two together and drives to  the restaurant to meet Roz. She's there, all right, only she has  come to  the Formosa on a tip that there's a rich Texan coming into town who will be  an easy mark. Boy, has she got the wrong man.
It's a quirky premise and  could have gone awfully wrong if writer-director Robinson wasn't completely  in tune with the material. Elements like Fletcher's rock sculpture hobby or  his grandmother playing Chopin on the tuba or the repeated dream sequences  that lead the two lovers to each other seem rather precious on paper. But  Robinson has the perfect touch with the material, using Chopin's haunting  ""Berceuse"" (Opus 57) in several sections of the score to create  an aural beauty that nicely complements some of the breathtaking images  that he puts on the screen.  The movie somehow captures the essence of  stillness in a way that envelops and interests the audience. It's a stellar  accomplishment, this quiet, rapturous beauty, because so few films can  manage to be both absorbing and radiant at the same time.
Fraser gives a  wonderfully modulated performance, conveying both Fletcher's oddball quirks  and down-to-earth strengths. Going had an even more challenging task,  taking Roz's apathy toward life and love and bringing her to a place where  she feels open again to life's possibilities. Going communicates all this  and more, faltering only slightly in believability during the con-game  scenes. But that's a small quibble for a film that manages the neat trick  of being eclectic, interesting, romantic and moving. Anyone looking for an  antidote to ""Godzilla"" or the often overblown romanticism of  ""The Horse Whisperer"" would do well to see ""Still  Breathing."" It's one of the gems of the screen year.
