Loved the main character, kind of an older spinster, cigarette-smoking version of Walter Mitty during the Mexican Revolution.  Very enjoyable story and sweet.  -SMR",1398124800,,284,4.833333333333333
8189287,4,B000P6R5UW,"I bought this movie because I like the acting of Federico Luppi and was not disappointed.  The plot revolves around an old maid aunt, living with a plain vanilla family, who has fantasies about Tom Mix.  When desparados threaten the town, she writes to Tom Mix to get her hero to save them all.  Enter Federico Luppi, a wandering and aging vaquero, to the rescue.  It's not great art, but is charming and has a happy ending.",1365811200,,424,4.467532467532467
