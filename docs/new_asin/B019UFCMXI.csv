8746030,4,B019UFCMXI,"Basically an x-rated sex film with a mysterious, underlying crime plot! The film was shot really well and looks good. The lead actor Jamie Gillis and all the supporting actors  gave convincing performances. Be prepared because this is a porn flick with a plot. But i would reccommend it to the wildly imaginative cinema goer. I have one hell of an imagination and can fill in any gaps in the intriguing, elusive storyline! As another reviewer on a website i can't remember mentioned, there is a slight similarity to David Lynch's Lost Highway! A film i really enjoy. Sometimes i love watching cryptic films like Lost Highway,  In The Mouth Of Madness, David Cronenberg's Crash and of course Twin Peaks! Any fan of those may enjoy  CORRUPTION! Also,  as an easter egg accessible on the main menu, Roger Watkins other more well known film! Last House On Dead End Street! Oh, one last thing. Why wasn't Eric Bogosian in CORRUPTION?  Where the hell was Eric Bogosian when this was made? lol. ha ha!",1490745600,,994,4.722543352601156
8746031,5,B019UFCMXI,This is a truly unique fantasy world type movie.  I can't say much without giving anything away but I highly recommend it. Beautiful cinematography as well,1484265600,,155,4.961538461538462
