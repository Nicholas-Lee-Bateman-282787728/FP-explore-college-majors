288277,4,630026971X,"before there was CUJO, MANS BEST FRIEND,and all the ANIMALS ON THE LOOSE films of the 70s i.e. GRIZZLY and DAY OF THE ANIMALS and that taco bell dog there was this classic ""dogs from hell"" film and done way better. big kudos to director Robert Clouse for setting this story on an island. It provided for great building suspense as these people stuck in paradise with a bunch of mans best friends gone totally wild and blood thirsty canines left by visiting insensitive tourists eating and attacking the living and they cant get off the island. ridiculous yes but if there was a boat and they got off the island there wouldnt be a movie. For me there's a couple scenes that to this day disturb me a bit. a scene where a transients normal dog gets totally attacked by a pack of other crazy hounds. the scene looked sooo realistic. these were really well trained dogs. Another is a scene on a pier when joe don baker, in slow motion, backs up his jeep running over the crazy hounds that have surrounded him. i kept saying its only a movie. well do check out this tense little flick cuz it still holds up very well to this day.",1321747200,8,1123,4.352380952380952
288278,5,630026971X,"I always thought Cujo was the only dog-goes-beserk flick that gave me chills. Then when I saw this movie I realized that Cujo isn't the only one. This movie needs to be put on DVD. While it has some cliche moments like knowing the next attack and the whole house burning thing to stop the dogs has been done. What makes this movie stand out is that although fiction it shows that dogs can turn on people when abused or abandoned.

The leader of a pack a Lab mix really gives a good performance he is scary I'll admit! And the little collie mix that learns how to unstuck his rope was awesome. Very good dogs with excellent trainers.

Please give this movie a chance.",1203552000,6,666,4.32
288279,5,630026971X,"I was into these nature thrillers years ago when I was a bit younger and I saw this one on a local network on a Saturday afternoon. I am happy to see it on Amazon as this hidden gem is yet to be re-released on DVD. The plot was a bit predictable for this type of flick but the realistic images and the fact that something like this could actually (and does) happen (but on a smaller scale) will send more shivers down your spine than today's blood, guts and spacemen horror films.",1148601600,9,480,4.172043010752688
288280,3,630026971X,"I managed to catch it on cable a year or so back, and thought it was pretty decent as far as cheesy-70's ""nature attacks"" movies go. Even with the bloodthirsty poodles. I remember a setpiece involving a rabid  dog chasing the characters through a cabin that I found surprisingly  hair-raising and theres a sublimely absurd scene where the dogs chase a  vehicle onto a dock, and come to a screeching halt when the vehicle starts  to back up.",962236800,11,440,4.602564102564102

288327,5,630026971X,"Just as I expected...great piece of cinema from the 70's.  Perhaps not that gruesome as one would expect by today's standards, but still entertaining and well acted.  The movie looks like a small budget production with lesser known actors/stresses, which makes this film even more enjoyable to watch, so I think.  The Pack (1977), is not a movie for extreme dog lovers...especially if you find dog brutality unacceptable.  The story of the movie is about a group of people living on the Seal Island (Canada) who come across a pack of wild dogs led by a viscous mongrel.  The dogs all come from a dog pound from which they were once adopted by visiting tourists and later abounded in the woods.  It is a story of survival, the wild pack of dogs basically go after the residents one by one.  As the movie progresses the residents of the island come together to fight off the dogs...will they succeed? Watch and find out.",1422230400,3,918,4.62962962962963
288328,5,630026971X,"I loved this movie. It arrived in very good condition and on time. I was very pleased with this purchase. I remember watching this movie back in the 70's when it was first released. This movie is a little cheesy now, but it has a real story to tell. It serves as a reminder of what can happen when man discards their family pets without considering the consequences. It shows how man's best friend can turn into man's worst enemy. I recommend it to anyone that likes man against nature type of movies.",1422057600,,501,4.397849462365591

288353,5,630026971X,"AWESOME! I love this movie years back as a young teenager and it is so modern today with excitement!.  The best dog revenge thriller ever!! The sound effects and visual is equalling compelling despite a late seventy's film. Joe Don Baker, A KNOCK OUT PUNCH!!",1399939200,,258,4.733333333333333
288354,5,630026971X,"Movie had a beautiful picture and sound. Nice package and no scratches. I bought two, one for me and one for my mother. She was also happy with the picture quality and sound. Very good quality! Pleased with the arrival time too. Happy with everything!",1394409600,,251,4.6
288355,3,630026971X,"""The Pack"" is an unusual case. I did like the set-up at first, but the movie is too involved in animal cruelty and exploitation for my taste. I think the movie ""White Dog"" goes much further in exploring issues of animal ethics than this dreck does. These poor dogs are starving because of human idiocy, so I didn't think the ending was just with them getting burned to death in the boat house. The final image is touching, but I found the simple-minded pull towards a ""Jaws""-feel to be silly. This was a potentially powerful story spoiled by much overdoing of the hostile situations. Joe Don Baker is a reliable actor, a Charles Bronson-type of sorts, who is very good in smaller supporting roles even (""Cape Fear,"" no?). I am an animal lover, so some of this was tough to watch, even though I wanted to like the message of the story.
The Warner Archive presentation is clean, with good picture and quality sound, but overall, the picture just isn't essential. I was happy to see all of these rare titles coming out again, but until we see ""The Boy who Cried Werewolf"" on special edition archive DVD, I won't be going through the roof over these reissues. But I suppose I should be thankful that it's now available.",1389225600,,1215,4.552511415525114
288356,4,630026971X,this is a old drive in picture back in the day it was I guess it was scary but by today's standards it is very mild has a good story its not far fetched the dvd has no x-tras on it but it is a good move joe don baker does a great job,1386201600,,233,3.3333333333333335
288357,5,630026971X,"This show is for the non-conformists out there. The Campy-Campers. The ones who follow and totally let themselves be absorbed into raunchy-yet-fun and outta-the-box way of enjoying stuff that is so fun - in an awful way. It is for those of you who totally appreciate the glib and lowly contribution of the ""B grade"" movie presentation.
I know we are few and far between...but, that's what makes us special.

288358,3,630026971X,"This is a good little action/ adventure/horror movie. It tells the story of vacationers visiting a secluded island, not knowing that the people that were their before left their dogs at the place and now the animals are hungry,mean wild dogs out to attack any human they see. Joe Don Baker plays the leader of the group and must find a away to lead the vacationers to safety. A nice little not well known gem of a movie.",1365206400,,420,4.397435897435898

288362,4,630026971X,"Very well filmed suspense/horror featuring the great Joe Don Baker! As usual, humans are making life easier on themselves by getting rid of the minor responsibility of keeping a dog. This time poor dogs are getting ditched on a small island as families relocate to the mainland. By no fault of their own and with no food, they start attacking livestock and people as they rampage through the countryside. Warnings are not followed and true to life, ignorant people dominate this film and Joe don is the only one with enough sense in his head to be a survivor. Although not an action film, Joe Don carries the film on his capable shoulders facing danger as desperate, neglected, and crazed dogs lurk in the shadows. The ending does justice to man's best friend by showing not all of them were man eaters. Director Robert Clouse does another great job here as he normally does when not directing kung fu movies. 16x9 dvd-r picture and sound is very good.",1360368000,,952,4.6726190476190474

It was as good as I remembered, it stands the test of time. Vampire and Werewolf movies are good but the most freighting horror movies are about dogs, sharks, bears, and other animals that are real. In The Pack a small group of people staying on a island come under attack from wild dogs, while not a true story it feels like it could be. Like Cujo, but with more dogs, and more action.",1435363200,,559,4.0
