7934052,4,B000059RSH,"Ator is a fantasy film series of four European movies created by Italian director Joe D'Amato, under the pseudonym David Hills. D'Amato wrote and directed the first, second, and fourth films in the series, himself disregarding the existence of the third. Ator was played in the first three films by Miles O'Keeffe, while Eric Allan Kramer played the Son of Ator in the fourth.

Ator is a swordsman, alchemist, scientist, magician, scholar, and engineer, with the ability to sometimes produce objects out of thin air (see Ator 4). Ator movies basically consists of Ator fighting the bad guys and helping out the girls. Never any time to rest for Ator as he's always on the move from different enemies. The Blade Master has classic power hungry villains, some cool set pieces, cheesy synthesizer score, PG rated(could have used some gore), sword fights, and of course Ator the Barbarian hero. Low Budget here so don't expect some Hollywood masterpiece, these are underground movies for lovers of cult fantasy films. Fans of the genre know what I'm talking about. Here is a quick history of the series so people know what is what.

ATOR THE FIGHTING EAGLE (1982)The first film in the series is 1982's Ator, The Fighting Eagle. As the film opens Ator asks his father for permission to marry his sister. Ator's father tells Ator that he is adopted and so he can marry his sister if he likes. The rest of the film deals with Ator's sister being kidnapped by the high priest of the Spider Kingdom and Ator having to go on an epic quest to save her.

THE BLADEMASTER part (1984) Re-edited TV version years later as Cave Dwellers) lends credence to the argument that Joe D'Amato was using Ator as a ploy to make money from the Conan franchise. Like its predecessor, it went into production shortly after the theatrical release of the 2nd Conan movie, Conan the Destroyer, and was released later the same year.

IRON WARRIOR (1987) Joe D'Amato dropped the Ator franchise in 1986, around the same time when it became public knowledge that there were no plans to make a third Conan movie. Instead, in 1987, a new director, Alfonso Brescia, wrote and directed the third Ator film, Iron Warrior, which follows the same loose plot as Ator l'invincible 2. The film abandons the continuity of the first two films (even so far as to completely contradict Ator's established back-story of having been adopted as a baby, instead opening with him playing as a child with a twin brother), and with writer/director D'Amato gone, the unintentional plot device of anachronisms disappears. Instead, Brescia turns the film into an art house picture, utilizing a variety of cinematic techniques and camera tricks to act as symbols or give deeper meaning to the film. Ator's character is also drastically changed: Here, he has black hair in a ponytail, and speaks roughly 50 words in the entire movie.
  .
QUEST FOR THE MIGHTY SWORD (AKA) THE HOBGOBLIN) (1990) Joe D'Amato was reportedly displeased with Brescia's approach to his character, and so re-took control of the franchise in 1988. In 1990, D'Amato released the final Ator film, Ator l'invincible, a retooling of the first film in the series. It was released in Europe and the United States under a variety of titles including: Ator III: The Hobgoblin (indicating D'Amato's disregard for the previous film), Quest for the Mighty Sword, and Hobgoblin. Here, Eric Allan Kramer plays the son of Ator; this is the only film in the series not to feature Miles O'Keeffe in the lead role.",1422057600,2,3510,4.841666666666667
7934053,3,B000059RSH,"I'll star with the goodies: Beautiful graphics and cinematography, awesome weapons, great costumes, good story, decent audio, tolerable acting, so-so special effects, and a cool but cheap giant monster. For a low budget film the production was great.

The movie is not exactly ""action-packed"" but it has 3 cool action scenes that features the hero Ator and his two companions beating every bad guy that comes along.

NOW! About the ""slow"" problems. The battle movements are VERY slow, the battle choreography is pretty much like Beastmaster but a little slower, the editing was good but I was expecting more quickieness from a hero called The Blade Master. The storyline is also pretty slow, you can get bored by the blah,blah,blah! But those are the ONLY main problems, the rest was great.

P.S: If you can tolerate slow action movements in a fantasy film the I recomend this one, but if you are looking for HIGH excitement like Beastmaster, Conan the Destroyer or Lord of the Rings then search somewhere else.

Adios.",1271808000,,1019,4.941520467836257
7934054,5,B000059RSH,"The Blade Master aka Ator 2 Directed by the ""King of Sex and horror"" Joe D'Amato. In this sequel The Blade Master Ator, the Fighting Eagle returns. This time he must save a former mentor from the evil Zor. Ator battles cavemen, invisible swordsmen, barbarians and A huge Python! Along with his new sidekick Thong to finally have the ultimate showdown with Zor.

The Blade Master in my mind is the Best Ator movie in the series. The first one is a classic and the third one (Quest for the Mighty Sword) is alright but the fourth one (Iron Warrior) just stay away from that one!! Ator played my Miles O'Keeffe delivers a very good acting role in this picture. With the budget mainly going to the cool snake the movie does lack on all the blood and little to no gore that the first movie had. The only gore scene without giving it away involves a women.

If you like and I know you will this movie I recommend Ator - The Fighting Eagle (Don't buy the Legacy Entertainment version it is cut of all blood and a decapitation scene), Quest for the Mighty Sword, Conquest, and The Conan Movies.",1187481600,3,1086,4.398009950248756
