7890791,5,6305454329,"THIS VIDEO WAS AWESOME TO ME BECAUSE IT WAS JUST EVERYTHING I WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT THE WOMEN OF THE WWF. THIS IS WHAT I WISHED THEY WOULD HAVE DONE FOR THE DIVAS OF TODAY. I LOVE LEARNING ABOUT THE DIVAS BECAUSE THEY TO ME ARE SO AMAZING. THEY HAVE CHANGED WOMEN'S WRESTLING AND MADE IT IN TO SOMETHING INCREDIBLE. THIS VIDEO HAS INSIDE LOOKS ON SABLE, JACQUELINE, DEBRA, CHYNA, TERRI, IVORY AND TORI. ALL GREAT STORIES AND THE BEST PART IS THEY SHOW CLIPS FROM THE RING. THIS IS GREAT I AND LOVE THIS VIDEO VERY VERY MUCH. IF YOU ARE A TRUE WWE DIVAS FAN YOU HAVE TO GET THIS VIDEO! 100% GREAT AND 100% HOT!",1281657600,,608,4.161016949152542
7890792,4,6305454329,"I bought this video because I am a Joanie Laurer[Chyna] fan. Not that I didn't enjoy the other divas in the video[Sable,Jacqueline,Debra,Terri,Ivory and Tori{no,not Torrie Wilson,the other Tori. You know,the WORKER who was good enough to be a Tough Enough trainer and wasn't just a t&a show?}]By the way,what happened to calling these women women?Is women or woman such a bad word to use in pro wrestling that we have to call a woman either a diva or a knockout?Anyway,this video took place around 1998-1999 back when there was a women's [not divas] title. There's not a lot of wrestling in this so if that's what you're looking for then you may want to pass on this video. But if you like looking at gorgeous women then this is worth seeing. Including footage from Jacqueline's 1998 bikini contest with Sable that THANKFULLY was not censored. Good luck finding anything like that these days from the WWF.Yeah,yeah, I know that's not the right initials but damn it I was raised on the WWF era and I refuse to call it anything else. This video features the women in different locations like the beach,the gym[guess who],the cheap seats of an empty arena being interviewed. There's a couple of interviews in this video[outside the cheap seats].Oh,and,um, Debra's in the jacuzzi in a bikini. The best looking women in WWF ever are in this video. I also recommend future WWF videos like Divas 2001-2004.",1265414400,,1399,4.833333333333333
7890793,3,6305454329,"This video showcases the only 7 ""divas"" who were in the WWE up till early 1999: Sable, Jackie, Chyna, Debra, Terri, Ivory, and Tori. Sure, it looks good on paper, but is it really? It is blatantly obvious in every shot that time is just being wasted. With Sable you don't get the chance to get to know her because a good 2 minutes is full of her standing around half naked <which is fun and all, but the same shots are used in her own video, Sable Unleashed> and a few more minutes are wasted on showing basically the whole Wrestlemania 15 match of Sable vs Tori, which is just unnecessary. Jackie's time is also wasted by showing her ...walking the beach, oy. Chyna's part in the video, which way too long is basically showing her working out, which is definitely nothing interesting. Debra's part is basically shadowed by her getting half naked at ""Rock Bottom"" in the striptease match b/w Goldust and Jarrett, which again, is fun...but if you have the pay per view, or if you have seen it, then why waste a good 3 or 4 minutes showing it in this video? Its simply filler time, which is unnecessary. Terri's part is basically the only decent part of the video. It is a good 7 or 8 minutes to get to know her, and the clips are very nice, showing her first with Goldust, then with Venis, and then with Jackie in PMS. It also shows her as she reflects on her personality which is always fun to try to understand. And then there is a 5 or 6 minute clip of both Tori and Ivory in one, b/c they were both considered ""newcomers"" in the wwe in early '99. Nothing interesting here really...Ivory is hot, and Tori, well, talks like a man, and hearing her speak is simply nausiating.
When it comes down to it, the video is not TRULY worth it, but if you feel like you need this video, then by all means, get it. Im just really happy that i got a used copy rather than a new, more expensive one..",1059609600,3,1887,4.259052924791086
7890794,5,6305454329,I enjoyed Come Get Some.  It has a look at 7 of the most beautiful women in and out of the ring.  This tape has highlights of each woman and some personal footage as well as a look at 2 of the top women wrestlers now.  Get this for the holidays.,943833600,9,245,3.764705882352941
7890795,1,6305454329,This is by far the worst video the WWF has ever produced.  It has absolutely nothing to do with wrestling; watching it is like having your  teeth pulled.  I would only recommend this video if you are an insomniac  and need something to put you to sleep.,941241600,3,253,4.319148936170213
