3446347,4,B001A94CSQ,"""Bangkok Love Story"" (Thailand, 2007) tells the unusual and emotional story of the growing relationship between two street-smart macho young men running from gangsters in that steamy, dark city.

Maek (referred to in subtitles as ""Cloud"") has become a hired killer to help support himself, his younger brother and mother, all three of whom are infected with HIV from his stepfather.  He justifies his mission as only killing ""bad"" people, and crosses the boss when he refuses to execute a handsome young man, Iht (""Stone""), who had gotten too close to exposing one gangster's operation.  Cloud gets shot during the getaway, and Stone nurses him back to health, while they hide in exile in the inner city.  Helping Cloud with his bath one day leads to the duo getting carried away, and Cloud can't deal with his feelings for Stone, banishing him from his life.  Most of the rest of the film involves Stone's attempts at reconciliation, as well as greater detail about Cloud's family, who suffer persecution due to their illness.

A beautifully photographed and capably-acted film, which tells a simple story but tells it wonderfully and with great emotion (perhaps a bit too much for some critical viewers).  Won a couple of international film competitions. Dialogue in Thai with English subtitles, very easy to follow. DVD artwork is a bit misleading, as it shows the duo posing on a fancy, expensive sofa, while the entire film has them living in near squalor. DVD extras include several deleted scenes, which provide some additional background into the characters. Not rated, but would be a mild R due to violence, gay content and simulated sex; there is no complete nudity.  I give the film four spicy stars out of five.",1220227200,6,1723,4.937716262975779
3446348,4,B001A94CSQ,"The cover of the DVD for this very fine film is misleading: the photograph of the two leads in a rather quiet and elegant setting is about as far from the content of the cinematic adventure as imaginable. Writer/Director Poj Amon has created a love story that is more from the underbelly of the poor section of Bangkok than it is from the expected physical beauty of that Thai city, and rather than focusing on the 'tourist view' of Thailand, he instead finds a different kind of beauty molded into a love story from a far different perspective. And it works very well.

In the world of Thai organized  crime there is a star assassin - Maek ((Rattanaballang Tohssawat) - who kills 'bad people' to satisfy his bosses but cannot kill 'good people'.  He is the sole support of his mother and younger brother, both of whom suffer from AIDS - the source of their infection is the abusive live-in stepfather.  Maek wants to provide a good home for his little family, somewhere away from the slums of Bangkok, so that his little brother will no longer have to ply the hustler role on the streets to help support his ailing mother.  Maek is assigned a 'hit' and in stalking the young lawyer he is supposed to assassinate he finds an attraction to the obviously good, married, handsome Iht (Chaiwat Thongsaeng).  When the moment comes to complete his grim duty, Maek cannot kill a 'good man' and in the setup Maek himself is shot.  Iht is compassionate and rescues Maek from the streets, taking him to his shelter to nurse him back to health.  The two men bond and eventually submit to their passion.  Yet when Maek recovers, he cannot face the truth of his feelings and separates himself from Iht.  Iht's wife is suspicious about Iht's distance, stalks him, and witnesses a secret moment of passion between Maek and Iht, and the discovery turns her into a potential assassin herself. Iht is now by himself, unable to regain Maek's commitment until a series of events leads to the ultimate arrest of Maek: from the imposed separation caused by Maek's incarceration, Iht remains faithful to his love.  The ending could have been triumphant (and for moments it is, emotionally), but instead  Poj Amon opts for tragedy, a writer's decision that makes the film even more powerful.

The cast of actors is excellent and the chemistry between the two leads is undiluted by the forces that are meant to separate them. In the end, this is a love story between two classes of people whose discovery of a forbidden love emphasizes some universal truths. It is a well-made, beautifully photographed film (Tiwa Moeithaisong is the gifted cinematographer)  that deserves a wider audience.  Grady Harp, August 08",1220054400,28,2688,4.7505376344086025
3446349,1,B001A94CSQ,"The trailer for this movie was beautiful. But the movie left me wanting. To me, it was unrealistic and just didn't flow right. The scenes, as beautiful as they are, were too drawn out, and somewhat ackward. This had such potential, but fell short. :(",1219795200,6,250,4.5777777777777775
3446350,4,B001A94CSQ,"Maek is an assassin for hire who kidnaps Iht, a married police informant. After taking Iht to his bosses, however, Maek learns that Iht is an innocent bystander and refuses to execute him, saying he does not kill innocent people. In the resulting fight, Maek is shot and escapes with the help of Iht. The two men hide out together and Iht nurses Maek back to health.

We gradually learn Maek's backstory, and discover he kills to earn money to care for his brother and his dying mother. As Iht and Maek grow closer, a romance develops between them. Maek must struggle with his own feelings of shame and memories of his abusive father as their enemies close in on the two men and their relationship is discovered.

Bangkok Love Story is very well acted and beautifully filmed. The two leads are attractive and likable and deliver very good performances. Rattanaballang Tohssawat is a standout as the tortured Maek. Some of the plot twists stretched the boundaries of believability for me, especially at the end, and prevent me giving it five stars. On the whole, this is a very beautiful and moving film.

It starts with a professional killer plying his trade, then we discover he is homosexual, carries a photo of the married man he lusts for, has a gay brother with HIV plus a mother with the same affliction received from an abusive husband, has been given the assignment to kill the man he secretly desires, they escape together after a big shootout, our hero is wounded, his captive nurses him back to health, they finally connect passionately.  But our hero can't accept his reality and hides from his lover.  It all ends in the most unbelieveable finish.  Everyone suffers and, sorry to say, so do we as viewers.  The photography is beautiful, the music full of yearning and silent moments of our two lovers sitting on ledges or standing on flat rooftops quietly pining...these aesthetic decisions all wrong.

3446359,4,B001A94CSQ,"While I have no concept of life in Thailand, the life portrayed in this film would leave the viewer to believe it is a poor, violent and crime filled country, or least life in Bangkok.

Typically, I am not a fan of excessive gunfire and death, and that has not changed after watching this film.  The weaving of crime and gunfire with homosexual lust and love is actually done rather well.  There is also a fair amount of quality cinematography.

That said, some may find the depth of the characters a bit challenging at times.  Not quite an hour into the film, we're already doing a flashback of how a love affair started, and/or ended.  Nonetheless, the last 1/3 of the film is redeeming, so hang in there if you can.  I just wish the first part could have been a touch milder.

In the end, you have a film about poverty, crime, murder, prostitution, rape, AIDS, family and love.  Make sure you watch the alternate ending in the DVD special features.  I'm not sure why it was cut - it genuinely garners emotion.  For me personally, it's not my genre of film, and not likely anything I would watch a second time, but the film is well done.",1330732800,2,1139,4.401913875598086

3446362,5,B001A94CSQ,"I noticed there was a wide variance of opinions on this little gem. It has an unassuming start with a hit man being told to basically 'take out bad people' and then he picks up someone who quite clearly is not. That is when he has something approaching an epiphany and everything kicks off.

That is where you think this is going to be an action movie, but like so many movies before it, this really is one of two parts (like 'Dust till dawn, or Full metal jacket) and unlike my two comparisons, this then becomes a tender and moving love story.

There could be a criticism here in that the film does not know what it wants to be and to be honest despite the beautiful actors and cinematography, it can appear slow in places. That said I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I am a fan of World Cinema and gay cinema so this pretty much ticked my boxes. It does have an alternative ending option too but I always feel you should go for the one as far removed from Hollywood as possible and that is the one the director chose too.",1302566400,,1019,4.220512820512821

3446364,2,B001A94CSQ,"Try not to laugh too much when you read the following plot.

Cool and lonely `Cloud' is a hired killer in Bangkok, doing this to support his younger brother and mother, both living in poverty and got AIDS from their stepfather, who sexual abused (and tried to do that to Cloud as well) his younger brother. Both keep the younger brother's condition a secret from their mother. Cloud promises him that one day he would take him and their mother away from all this.

Cloud's next target is the ridiculously handsome and buff `Stone', some kind of police informant, who has an evenly gorgeous girlfriend and somehow living a middle class life (you know, designer apartment and all) without the need to work a single day in his life.

Cloud kidnaps Stone following the order of the mafia boss, (the plot tells him not to kill Stone out right, unlike his other victims, so that he could later find out a reason not to, otherwise they cannot fall in love and have passionate sex later in the film) so he takes Stone to the the boss, following some meaningless discussion with the aim to tell the audiences that a) Cloud is a killer with a heart of gold because he only kills 'bad people'.  b) Stone is good people.

When Cloud refuses to follow the order and kill Stone , a shot-out erupts and Cloud is injured but escapes with Stone who shoots their way out of the mess. They fleet to their hide out (or shall we say love nest?), and the grateful Stone decides to take care of the injured Cloud, doing the wife's duty of cooking and the cleaning. Because it is Bangkok and it's hot and humid, both of them only need to wear white brief (or less) most of the time, giving female and gay viewers an eye full.

After many meaningful eye contacts and all, Stone makes the move to Cloud one day when he is rubbing Cloud's back in a bath, and chest, and more, leading to some bunny action. But after Cloud strains his sperm from his brains, he realises that this is all wrong, having sex with a man! The plot also needs to keep them apart for more drama, so he kicks Stone out after pumping him full.

Meanwhile Cloud's young brother has to take care of himself and mom, he gets beaten up every time he goes out to find food and medicine because people hate AIDS patients, and he also needs to prostitute himself to dirty men to find the money.

Stone goes back to his girlfriend after being kicked out by Cloud, but now he is batting for the other team so he neglects her sexual needs in bed, and goes back again and again to the hide out trying to find Cloud for more, but Cloud is hiding himself from him, just doing the peeking from a distance.

Finally Cloud is fully recovered and cashes in some money (selling his motorbike and Ray Ban sunglasses?) to take his family away, but Stone is there to corner him. The passion erupts again and they kiss and touch in rain storm. But because of the bad weather, everyone is looking out of the window, including Cloud's mother and brother, and you know what? Stone's gorgeous girlfriend in a car as well! So everyone knows!

After a good workout session for both, Cloud goes up to his mother's place and tells her to pack so he can take her and brother away. He goes to the top floor to find his brother but his brother is angry, and shouts his suffering from prostitution and the beating he got, all because of their damn horny stepfather and his AIDS. They shout a bit too loud so mother overhears everything, so she tries to hang herself because of that, both brothers are just on time to save the mother and ready to take her to the hospital, only to have some gunman firing a shot intended for Cloud, but finding her mother's body instead.

When the bothers are cremating their mother's body according to Thai's tradition, Stone goes back home and gets dumped big time by his girlfriend.

Cloud is out for revenge for his mother's death and intends to fleet with his brother after that. He lets his brother waiting for him at the train station and at the mean time tries to kill all the bad people. Stone is up to the plan of Cloud because the brother calls him and asks him to help Cloud, but Stone is a bit late and got himself shot by bad people's wife, after Cloud kills all the others anyway.

When Cloud arrives at the train station at the last moment, just on time to catch that train with his worried brother, the police is coming out of hiding to spoil the fun. Cloud gets arrested and the brother is totally disillusioned, seeing his only meaning for life taking away from him.

Now Cloud is sentenced and in jail and we see Stone comes to visit him, after a few chit chat, Cloud notices Stone is now blind. From the flash back we can see the bad people's wife tried to shoot Stone, but missed and the bullet shatters the glass of an old clock, with the slivers blinding the eyes of Stone. Stone tells Cloud not to worry, he will take care of the brother and wait for Cloud to come out.

But the brother's condition gets worse and he loses his strength to go on so he commits suicide (hanging again, just like their mother) and leaves Cloud a heart wrenching letter saying how he loves his brother and he is going to join their mother.

Some thirty odd years later, Cloud finally finishes his sentence, Stone is of course waiting for him, still blind. So they walk and talk what they are going to do with the rest of their life together, while Stone is confessing his love again for Cloud, Cloud gets silently shot dead by an unseen gunman. Stone does not notice it at first and keep saying how much he loves Cloud, then he notices Cloud is not guiding him anymore. He falls on the floor shouting Cloud's name and tries to find him, but he is blind so it takes some time before he finds the dead body of  Cloud. The camera draws away to the sky with sentimental music playing in the background.

Oh no, there is still one last ditch to drain your tears. Still more years later, an peppery haired Stone gets his operation and now he can see again, he finds that Stone has left him a video on a cell phone, made just after he kicked Stone out after that hot sex session, confessing to the camera and Stone that he would always love him till his last breath.

I guess the director knows his target audience well, gay who will suck up any sentimental rubbish as long as the actors show plenty of skin and the film is good to look at.

Talking about the cinematography, it is indeed beautiful to look at but it is such a ripoff from Wong Kar Wei's movies, it is not something I want to encourage. Many scences are just copies from some in Wong's films. (The ceiling sex scence for example, is a copy from Wong's own gay film 'Happy Together', a much superior film.)

The two stars are for the badly executed but slightly original idea to combine gangster movie with a gay love story, and the two leads eye candy starring in the film.",1270080000,6,6880,4.342679127725857

3446370,3,B001A94CSQ,"It's a nice idea - an assassin and his intended victim become allies, and, in hiding, unexpectedly find love together. Maek (played by Rattanaballang Tohssawat) is the assassin capable only of killing the bad guys. Iht (Chaiwat Thongsaeng) is his target, the lawyer a crime gang wants murdered.

The film is visually stunning, as is Chaiwat Thongsaeng as Iht. I could watch him watching paint dry all day long and not get bored. But as for the plot... Oh dear.

I desperately wanted to like this film. There was so much potential; the idea itself is a bit different - a gay version of Asian action flicks. But the melodrama puts Brazilian telenovellas to shame. It isn't enough that Maek's brother is a hustler who happily passes on the AIDS given to him by his paedophile stepfather, the mother is also infected, and eventually hangs herself. Oh and so does the brother, after a slow, lingering decline into AIDS hell. It isn't enough that Maek gets locked up for most of his life; when he finally gets out, he's gunned down. That's after Iht, who's been blinded by the widow of one of Maek's victims, has waited a lifetime for him. And because it's in a rainstorm, poor blind Iht doesn't realise Maek's been shot dead, and carries on talking about how much he loves Maek, and how Maek will be his new eyes from now on. Then a Hummer runs over both of them. (No, not really, but it might as well have done.)

The first half of the film, particularly the scenes in which Maek and Iht slowly fall in love - and lust, culminating in a steamy rooftop love scene - is promising. But it goes downhill rapidly, plummets of a cliff and is blown to smithereens as one tragedy tops another. And I like a it of tragedy me, but there's such a thing as overkill.
