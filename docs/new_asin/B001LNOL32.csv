8318971,5,B001LNOL32,"This book shows in very clear steps how to sprout from soil and water
There are examples of how the sprouts should look at each stage in the process
In addition examples are given for wheat grass and sunflower sprouts
This video provides what you need to learn
The gentleman starring in the video obviously cares for what he does and for plants a great deal
He offers some unconventional (in my opinion) ideas about the plant/human interaction
This is a practical video backed up by a man who seems to have genuine love for what he does",1259193600,5,536,4.479591836734694
8318972,5,B001LNOL32,"I'll make this very simple, (just like the teacher on this DVD!) this program will show you HOW to grow sprouts in water or earth, easily, cheaply, and organically!  Save money and get this DVD, as you will never need any other book or program in the subject!",1246665600,3,259,4.395833333333333
8318973,5,B001LNOL32,"If you need to be sure about sprouting, then this is the video for you.  A complete how to sprout video, showing both hydroponic and soil growing, for a wide range of sprouts, as well as great time saving, and money saving tips, all without ANY special equipment, things around the house or very(!) cheap to buy.

Lots of fun too, (as a bonus!), well recommended!",1241481600,4,363,4.484848484848484
8318974,5,B001LNOL32,"Sprouting is vital for our health.  I tried sprouting several times, with mixed success.  But as I read more and more about sprouting, I realized its FAR less expensive to grow your own then to buy them.  So I selected this DVD to teach me.  Perhaps some people have a natural green thumb, not me - but with this to teach me - or any one - no one will waste even one seed.

Very clear, very practical, very step-by-step",1240272000,5,419,4.1875
8318975,5,B001LNOL32,"Sprouting is not as easy as some books say - or perhaps it's just me.  I do have a green thumb - but not when it came to sprouting.  When I heard that Trefor Randall had this video out - I knew it would be a winner.  And it was, I now have bumper crops and sneak some into the kids salads.

Eating sprouts is a MUST, read why somewhere else, if you know it's a MUST, grow your own.  Learn from the master sprouter: Trefor.  He's great.

This DVD is cheap at twice the price for what it teaches!  Good growing!",1237420800,7,509,3.9215686274509802
8318976,5,B001LNOL32,"This is a super idea and great for those who have little to no idea about growing your own food, and especially fresh and organic! And with all the foods that go through radiation processes, or sit in refrigerated warehouses for months before they reach the market, while the 'general shopper' has no idea, but buys just because it's there! So much better when it's fresh, and the satisfaction alone when you've grown it with your own two hands. A plus as well when you've learned from Trefor Randall, since you can now do it yourself, save, and really know they're organic while not paying the price for the name 'Organic'! A 'must have' for those who enjoy 'fresh grown' and especially for those who enjoy sprouts with their salads, now you can grow  them on your own with this instructional and helpful DVD while saving at the same time!",1233187200,13,840,4.6
8318977,5,B001LNOL32,"Having a black thumb but always wanting to grow something, the urban farmer in me, I failed at every seed I put in the potting soil until I ran across this DVD by Trefor Randall, ""Hands on Sprouting: Learning the Secrets of Sprouting At Home."" The DVD was drawn to my attention because I had viewed another DVD, ""Transformational Fasting"" by the same director, James Tavian Alexander. I was surprised that the Sprouting DVD had some wonderful tips and great instruction on sprouting. With this new found information source I was able to turn my kitchen green with a nutritional food source that keeps my family fed and more dollars in my wallet. My thumbs are green and thanks to this DVD, my family is enjoying fresh herbs and other greens straight from my kitchen counter. This is a must have for any kitchen gardener.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-to-Manage-a-Behavior-Classroom-The-Beginners-Guide-to-Teaching-the-Emotionally-Disabled-and-the-Oppositional-Defiant-Child/dp/1438211104/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How to Manage a Behavior Classroom: The Beginners Guide to Teaching the Emotionally Disabled and the Oppositional Defiant Child</a>",1232841600,12,1195,6.204819277108434
8318978,5,B001LNOL32,"This DVD was very educational and informative.  To read how to grow plants and produce at home is a start, but to actually SEE the video on how to better my ""green thumb"" is even better!  Considering the economic slump most of us are in, being able to grow my own plants at home really made the difference.  Months after watching this video, I now have an eye-pleasing, wallet helping garden of which I use almost every day!",1232323200,17,424,4.410256410256411
